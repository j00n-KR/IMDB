0,MartinHafer,The overall package is very nice...,9,15 January 2010,"Having seen and hated Disney's last hand animated full-length cartoon, BROTHER BEAR, I was anxious about this new release. Would it follow in the footsteps of its predecessor or would it be like the Disney of old? Thankfully, it turns out my concerns were in vain--this was a very special film--and only for good reasons.I could do an in depth review of the film, but frankly this makes little sense. The movie came out about a month ago and by now there are 189,372 reviews (give or take) and so I'm not even going to give a plot synopsis. Instead, I want to talk about what I loved about the film. THe music was great.While there was no one great song that you'll find yourself singing after the film is over, all the songs were very good and set a wonderful Louisiana mood. I particularly liked hearing Dr. John singing the opening song, though also wondered why Randy Newman (the man who wrote the songs) didn't sing it himself-. He could have done justice to the song but I must admit Dr. John did a great job.My favorite thing about the film, though were the characters. While both leads were definitely flawed characters, they had character--a depth to them you seldom see in other Disney cartoons. This was especially true of the Prince. Flawed, of course, but also hard not to like. I also loved Tiana's friend, as she COULD have easily been a giant cliché (the spoiled and evil rich girl). Instead, while spoiled, she had a good heart and decency that violated formulaic storytelling--a major plus for the film. As far as Facilius goes, he was excellent because he and his shadows were downright terrifying--a first for a Disney villain.The final thing I loved was the level of fun in the film. BROTHER BEAR was preachy and anything but fun. However, THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG made me smile, was quite romantic and made me feel good--something few kids movies manage to do! Overall, this is the total package--entertaining and great entertainment for all but the most grouchy.",The Princess and the Frog
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Disney, Disney, welcome back to form!",9,23 March 2010,"Like most of the other reviewers here, I am a massive Disney fan at 17. Not only growing up on movies like Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King, which are not only two of my favourite Disney movies but two of my favourite movies ever, but also watching shows like Darkwing Duck, Talespin, DuckTales and The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and singing along to their theme tunes. From my earliest memories as a child, I remembered wanting to be a mermaid with Ariel, being spellbound by The Circle of Life, wanting to fly on a magic carpet with Aladdin, wanting to stay in Neverland with Peter Pan, getting all nostalgic whenever I heard When You Wish Upon a Star, singing The Bare Neccessities at the top of my lungs(still do it actually), wanting to hug Quasimodo as he cried over Esmeralda, crying at Bambi's mother's death, being scared to death by Ursula's laugh and laughing at the witty banter between Prince John and Sir Hiss. The Princess and the Frog mayn't be the best Disney movie of the lot, but it is for me the best Disney film of the last decade. This is coming from someone who loved Emperor's New Groove, Lilo and Stitch and Fantasia 2000, but was disappointed in Home on the Range and save a few exceptions(ie. Bambi 2) most of the sequels.One thing that springs to mind is the quality of the animation. I know some have complained of it being Saturday morning cartoon standard or direct to video sequel quality, but I found it absolutely stunning. The bayou scenes especially were exquisitely rendered and gave the film a warm richness, reminding me slightly of the Kiss The Girl scene from The Little Mermaid, and the backgrounds and landscapes reminded me of the splendour of the animation in The Hunchback of Notre Dame, a very underrated Disney film. The characters were also very well drawn, Tiana looking like a traditional princess and Dr Facilier looking as suave and charismatic as he sounds. The animation here is better than that of Titanic:The Animated Movie(which I am mentioning because that ripped off Beauty and the Beast and Cinderella, all but to name a few) and The Return of Jafar, both of which had in my opinion sloppy art direction. I know parents may complain of the voodoo scenes being inappropriate perhaps, but they were for me very vibrantly animated, intoxicating and both fun and scary.Another complaint I read was the songs being generic and forgettable. Can I disagree here? I am not trying to say people who say that are wrong, no, no, no, what I am saying is that I liked them. I do admit I am not a Randy Newman fan but I loved his songs for Cats Don't Dance and thought I will give Newman a chance. The tunes here are appropriately jazzy and upbeat, maybe not as memorable as the beautiful music of Beauty and the Beast, the rousing Lion King numbers, the lyrical melodies of Sleeping Beauty or the haunting and almost operatic ones of Hunchback(Hellfire never fails to give me goosebumps), but goodness aren't they an improvement on Home on the Range? The only song I remember from that film, which I found disappointingly average despite the voice cast and Alan Menken, was Slim's yodel song and that was for the use of William Tell and Ode To Joy. I loved the sinister yet upbeat tone of Friends on the Other Side, the tenderness of Ma Belle Evangeline, the fun of Dig a Little Deeper and the celebratory mood of Down in New Orleans. I also feel Anika Noni Rose has a strong, powerful, beautiful singing voice that I felt could've been used even more.The story is obviously enhanced and modernised to a New Orleans setting, I do agree there are some moments in the film that drag, but the film took a simple fairytale, enhanced it and on the whole made a charming and likable film out of it, and that isn't easy to do. The scripting isn't bad either, there are no lame pop culture references like there were in Doogal, and look how awful that was, and while maybe not as intelligent as films like Watership Down, there are some funny and moving moments. And I loved the characters. Both Tiana and Naveen have flaws(Tiana being ambitious and Naveen being spoilt), but they also have their charm and avoided being completely clichéd thanks to how they were animated, their motives in the film and the enthusiasm of Anika Noni Rose and Bruno Campos. Dr Facilier is a great villain, suave, charismatic yet menacing, he mayn't be the best of the lot, not being as complex as Frollo, as calculating as Maleficent, as funny as Ratigan or as scary as Ursula, he definitely leaves an impression, and Keith David's melodious and malevolent voice was perfect. Louis, the trumpet-playing alligator is a fun character, same with Charlotte who could have been clichéd but had some depth to her, while Ray the Cajun firefly is one of the better characters of the movie, being both funny and charming. It also helps he is voiced with real exuberance and sensitivity by the legendary Jim Cummings. His death I think is shocking and heart-rending, and Dr Facilier being dragged to the graveyard was suitably creepy.Overall, not the best Disney movie out there, but it is great, one of the better films of theirs to come out in recent years. 9/10 Bethany Cox",The Princess and the Frog
2,SnoopyStyle,contemporary black Disney princess,5,1 March 2015,"In a New Orleans mansion, the housekeeper reads 'The Frog Prince' to her daughter Tiana and rich little Charlotte La Bouff. Tiana would never kiss a frog. As a young woman, she works hard to save money to start her own dream restaurant as envisioned by her late father. Carefree Prince Naveen of Maldonia arrives in New Orleans and hyper Charlotte is so excited. He's looking to marry rich as he has been cut off. Voodoo witch doctor Facilier transforms Naveen into a frog and his valet Lawrence into Naveen. At the party, frog Naveen offers Tiana money to kiss him and she needs the money to open her restaurant. However the kiss transforms her into a frog instead. Frogs Naveen and Tiana escape into the bayou and befriends Louis the alligator and Ray the Cajun firefly. Good voodoo priestess Mama Odie tells them that Naveen must kiss a princess and they go to get a kiss from Charlotte, the princess of the Mardi Gras Parade.This is a more contemporary telling of a Disney princess story. The princess also happens to be the first black princess. I think the minority princess is a great idea but the contemporary aspect injects a lot of money talk. It strips the magic out of it for me. She kissed him for the money. I don't find that at all appealing. Also the need for a princess kiss makes this a class problem. It's a different side of the money question. Now it's Tiana's lower class that is the cause of her problem. It's all very irksome. The music is fine but nothing is catchy. I just wish the theme be more about love and less about money.",The Princess and the Frog
3,Prismark10,From a kiss to a frog,6,30 January 2018,"Disney's return to long form 2D animation was short lived in this updating of The Frog Princess. The story is set in 1920s New Orleans as a visiting prince is turned into a frog by voodoo, who ends up in adventures with waitress Tiana (also turned into a frog) who always dreamed of opening her own restaurant.The 2D style of animation actually takes some getting used to, there are some nice visualized sequences, it is an easy going story. Some of the characters reminded me of characters from other Disney cartoons however the songs and music were a bit bland.",The Princess and the Frog
4,kosmasp,Old School,6,27 March 2010,"Disney ""re-animates"" (no pun intended) the old school animated movie. And all with the help of the friendly folks from Pixar. What could go wrong? Nothing. And indeed at first glance everything looks great. And while it is a family affair (checking every Disney check-list point there is), it never really sparked a fire with me (or the woman I was watching this with for that matter).Overall I enjoyed the movie, it's anything but bad. But I couldn't really understand all the praise it got. As you can see, opinions can be very diverse. And maybe while you are reading this, you are asking yourself, how I didn't enjoy it more. I can't give a rational explanation. I even liked the sidekick crocodile. Really liked him. The frog was funny, there were some funny takes on the whole thing. But the overall impression was: Well it's nice, but too tongue-in-cheek to be compared with the traditional animated movies, but too ""old school"" to really be completely fresh (or a fresh take) ...All in all, an entertaining movie for the family, but nothing to get too excited about (unless you loved the songs from the classic Disney movies, then you will relish every single minute of this film).",The Princess and the Frog
5,jboothmillard,The Princess and the Frog,6,2 October 2010,"Disney hadn't made a hand-drawn cartoon film since Home on the Range, so six years on directors Ron Clements and John Musker (The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Hercules) decided to bring back both this and the classic fairytale premise. Basically this is a modernised take on the well-known fairytale, The Frog Prince, set instead in the 1920's New Orleans, the time where jazz music was very popular. Tiana grew up thinking that the fairytale where a girl kisses a frog was gross, and she dreamt that her father James (Terrence Howard) would be able to build their restaurant, Tiana's Place. Now grown up, Tiana (Dreamgirls' Anika Noni Rose) is working as a waitress and earning tips willing to keep her promise to her now dead father and living mother Eudora (Oprah Winfrey). Meanwhile, carefree Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos, I mistook him Antonio Banderas in the trailer) is visiting New Orleans looking for a wife to end his money troubles, being cut off from his parents' fortune. But he tricked by the nasty voodoo witchdoctor Dr. Facilier (Keith David), being turned into a frog, with his abused butler Lawrence (Peter Bartlett) being turned into the Prince. After seeing her wish on a star to get the restaurant she dreams of, frog Naveen introduces himself to a princess costume wearing Tiana, and when they kiss, she becomes a frog too. After being cast into the swamps, Naveen and Tiana avoid danger a few times, before meeting the trumpet playing and jazz loving Louis the crocodile (Michael-Leon Wooley) who knows of voodoo queen Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis). While the nasty Doctor and Lawrence are getting their plan to fill their pockets in motion, Naveen and Tiana, slowly falling for each other, with the help of Cajun firefly Ray (Jim Cummings) find Mama Odie who gives them some misunderstood advice. To become human again, Naveen needs to be kissed by a real princess before midnight, and they realise that Charlotte (Jennifer Cody), daughter of 'Big Daddy' La Bouff (John Goodman), could be that woman. Eventually they reach the city to find Charlotte to get that kiss, and they also confront Dr. Facilier to give him his comeuppance. In the end, it looks like the kiss from Charlotte comes too late, but Naveen and Tiana return to the swamps, get married, and because of her being a princess now, they both turn human, and Tiana gets her dream restaurant with Naveen as waiter. The animation is good return to routes and is really good quality, the jazzy songs are catchy, and the characters are all as good as you can expect, it is a good effort, and certainly a great family fantasy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for ""Almost There"", Best Song for ""Down in New Orleans"" and Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film. Good!",The Princess and the Frog
6,Tweekums,A delightful retelling of a classic fairy tale,10,28 October 2017,"After a prologue where we a mother reading 'The Frog Prince' to her young daughter Tiana and her friend Charlotte we jump forward fourteen years. Tiana is now working hard to open her own restaurant in her home city of New Orleans. Around this time Prince Naveen arrives in New Orleans hoping to find a wealthy woman to marry; Charlotte is the perfect candidate and her father is hosting a ball in the Prince's honour. The Prince, and his valet Lawrence, meet the sinister voodoo witch doctor 'Dr Facilier' who offers to do a tarot reading for them he has plans of his own though and transforms Naveen into a frog and Lawrence to look like the prince. Naveen the Frog later meets Tiana, and because of her costume mistakes her for a princess. Thinking he can be saved like the Frog Prince he asks her for a kiss it doesn't work; she becomes a frog! They flee into the bayou and meet various dangers as well as some interesting new friends; notably an alligator who wants to be a jazz trumpeter and a firefly who believes the evening star is his beloved. Here they search out Mama Odie, a hoodoo priestess they believe can cure them.Shortly before this film was made it looks as though Disney was giving up on traditional animation; CGI was the future this shows they hadn't completely given up; it also shows they can still make great films. The story is a delightful twist on the classic story and is populated with great characters. Much was made at the time of release about how Tiana was Disney's first African American princess; watching the film one wouldn't really think about it; she is just a great character who happens to be black which is how it should be. She is a likable role model for all young viewers; she works hard to make her dream come true rather than waiting for a wealthy man to sweep her off to a life of luxury. Prince Naveen is likable despite his flaws, perhaps because of them. Dr Facilier is a suitably creepy villain who provides plenty of child friendly scares. The other characters met along the way are classic Disney and provide plenty of laughs and perhaps a few tears in one particularly poignant moment. As one would expect the animation is top notch with good character designs and stunning backgrounds. Overall this was a really impressive animation from Disney; it is definitely worth watching and I imaging it will be loved for years to come.",The Princess and the Frog
7,paul_haakonsen,A magical take on the story that we all know and love...,7,8 January 2013,"With ""The Princess and the Frog"" Disney makes a grand return back to their roots and basics; back to what we all know and love Disney for. Although this is a Disney take on a classic tale, then they pulled it off quite nicely - as to be expected.The story told in this movie is a story that I just about believe that every man, woman and child around the world is familiar with, although it has been significantly changed though. But the basics is the story that we know. A prince and a waitress is turned into frogs and their only salvation is a sacred kiss. On their journey through the swamp, our two heroes meet an abundance of interesting creatures and personalities.The animation is, as always, really great and really have that unique Disney touch to it, that both younger and older audiences love and adore.But better yet is the voice acting. They really managed to put together such an amazing ensemble for this movie. Most impressive in my opinion was Keith David (doing the voice for Dr. Facilier) and Bruno Campos (doing the voice for Prince Naveen). They both have such distinctive and charismatic voices that they were really well-cast for this animation.""The Princess and the Frog"" is a great movie that offers laughs, romance, thrills and magic to young and old alike. If you enjoy Disney animations, then you definitely have to get acquainted with ""The Princess and the Frog"" if you aren't already.",The Princess and the Frog
8,Quinoa1984,"there's magic in the air, for a little while",7,12 December 2009,"Disney's first 2D animated film in five years is a walk, not a sprint or even a run or trot, in the right direction. If they can keep up the fresh and colorful animation mixed in with catchy/cool songs and memorable characters as they used to, they'll perhaps get the reputation they deservedly had in the early 1990s (and, by proxy, for most of their existence as a studio since 1937). Ironically it was the very studio (PIXAR) that John Lasseter runs, who executive produces the film The Princess and the Frog (and probably closely supervised), that eclipsed the kind of animation done before by the likes of directors Clements and Musker. As it stands, this is not an all-time great Disney-animated film, but it's fun and entertaining and will keep the kids clasped to their seat in full attention. It even has, as corny as may sound, a wishing star up in the sky, nicknamed 'Evangeline'.It's plot is, like other Disney movies, faithful and a twist on the original premise. The Frog Prince is about the girl who kisses a frog and then he becomes a prince. In this one, a girl kisses the frog and she herself becomes the frog along with the frog prince. Simple enough? Well, not entirely: Filmmakers Clements and Musker transpose this story and (perhaps topically in post-Katrina America) take us to New Orleans in the Jazz age circa 1920. It's about a waitress, Tiana, who just wants to open up her own shop. A stuck-up French Prince comes to town, and he gets entranced by a voodoo doctor called The Shadow Man (or Mr. Facilier, take your pick, he's them both), and turns him into a frog and prepares to pay back his debt to his ""friends on the other side"" (other voodoo spirits) by taking over the city. The the Prince Naveen, now a frog, asks for a kiss from Tiana, and boom, turns into a frog herself.It turns into one of those wacky stories where human-animals and animal-animals interact and go on an adventure (Louis, a trumpet-player alligator named after Satchmo, is one of these), and there's plenty of songs and fun and some sadness and heartbreak and reconciliation, as happens often in classic Disney fare. One wants to come out of The Princess and the Frog finding it to be a true Disney classic, up there with Aladdin and the Lion King if not the older ones like Pinocchio and Alice in Wonderland. But as it turns out it's mostly either really extraordinary or just decent. Extraordinary things include its villain, Facilier, voiced by the unmistakable and incredible Keith David, and the animation for his musical number; also the general air of the music from Randy Newman is wonderful, from the Dr. John opening to the various nods to ragtime jazz (it's probably the only movie for kids that will mention Sidney Bechet, which is much appreciated. Less extraordinary are weak supporting characters (i.e. Tiara's friend, an aspiring princess) or scenes that needed a little more work on the excitement and comedy like with the bayou hunters.But for those looking for, after long-last, an example of fine animated craftsmanship, it's got a lot going for it and succeeds on a lot of what it sets out to do. It's safe with touches of daring, and romantic without being too corny (that is, for a Disney movie with a wish-upon-a-star featured prominently).",The Princess and the Frog
9,tavm,"The Princess and the Frog is a fine Disney-animated feature that bathes in the charms of New Orleans, Louisiana",8,14 December 2009,"I glanced at the many comments of this Walt Disney 2-D, mostly hand drawn, animated feature to see if any one of them came from where this movie is set-New Orleans, Louisiana. Since many of them were identified as from the United States, I have no idea. Look at my username being used under the movie title and know that the capital city I live in is just a two hour drive to and from the Crescent City. As a result, when watching this feature with my movie theatre working friend, we were wonderfully surprised to see and hear many items unique to the Pelican State: the city newspaper ""The Times-Picayune"", familiar sights like the French Quarter, and mentions of delicacies like gumbo, beignets, and jambalaya! Add to that a Cajun firefly, a Creole voodoo villain, and an alligator named Louis who plays the trumpet (no doubt a tribute to N.O. native Louis Armstrong-the great Satchmo) and you've got such a stirring melting pot of entertaining supporting characters. But the real treat is the leading characters of Prince Naveen as voiced by Bruno Campos and, especially, that of working girl (in the best sense of the word) Tiana as voiced and sung by Anika Noni Rose who I remembered liking in her last role in Dreamgirls. They're both a little stubborn but when it all comes down to it, they have their own set of charms as well. Two more characters I liked were the rich, white, spoiled girlfriend of Tiana named Charlotte, who really cares for her friend's happiness in spite of her occasional self-centeredness and her father, ""Big Daddy"" La Bouff, who I immediately recognized as the voice of New Orleans resident John Goodman. Great verbal and visual humor abounds and the songs of Randy Newman seem entertainingly authentic to both the period and setting. So on that note, I highly recommend The Princess and the Frog.",The Princess and the Frog
10,Doylenf,Entertaining--but so much talent wasted on a flimsy storyline...,6,17 December 2009,"I think Disney is back in good form with THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG, but what it seems to lack is a a more frightening villain and a better quality of songs. The songs are catchy enough but quite forgettable without a single standout to match the musical numbers in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST or THE LITTLE MERMAID.The backgrounds are superior with a good suggestion of New Orleans and the bayou. The fireflies are effectively used and all of the background art is exceptionally well done. But what the story lacks are characters to really care about and a stronger overall story.Disney fans should enjoy it and I'm sure most of us prefer the hand-drawn aspect of Disney's best films rather than all this computer technology animation so lacking in visual values and imagination.As usual, the voice work is excellent and there are some gags that really make you appreciate the humor injected into many scenes. Still, the lingering feeling is that a better script would have made the brilliant art work more worthwhile.",The Princess and the Frog
11,dbborroughs,Disappointing by the numbers film,5,28 December 2009,"Young woman in New Orleans wants to open a restaurant. She is good friends with a rich girl at who's party she ends up meeting prince who has been turned into a frog. When she kisses the frog she is turned into a frog. The pair then has to cross the bayou in the hopes of becoming human again. New Disney film is a big to do because its a return to ""hand drawn"" animation. I think its a less to do because its a by the numbers tale that seems to have been assembled in a plug and play style. Take a classic tale, then add in a lesson, big name stars for voices, a score by Randy Newman that sound like Randy Newman, have Dr John sing, lift character design from other films, have very few real plot twists, change the color of the lead characters and stir. The result is less then hoped for, and certainly nowhere near the best film of the year ala Time Magazine. While I'm not a huge fan of the princess films of Disney, I have to say this one just sort of missed for me too. The problem is as I said the plug and play nature of it all. Yes I did love some things, the trumpet playing alligator and the villainous Shadowman, but the rest just sort of laid there. Obviously I'm not the target audience, that said, this was still a disappointment for me.",The Princess and the Frog
12,Calicodreamin,Cute Disney movie,7,16 April 2020,"Perfectly cliche, the princess and the frog is a truly heartwarming Disney movie. The characters are fun and well developed, the storyline flows well, and the animation is good. The songs didn't flow as seamlessly as I would have liked, the movie almost didn't need them. The characters made this movie, loved ray the lightning bug.",The Princess and the Frog
13,neil-476,You might need a translator,8,10 February 2010,"Disney's latest offering in traditional hand-drawn animation is very good. Although it uses traditional fairy tale elements (in particular, princesses kissing frogs) it is a story where I was never 100% confident that I knew where it was going (although, once it got there, I said, ""Oh yes,"" to myself).I find that I am getting so used to CGI that sometimes I forget just how good traditional drawn animation can be, and there are some sequences (particularly one early on featuring a streetcar at twilight) which are simply gorgeous.The story is fast moving and entertaining, and the characters are well designed, visually attractive, and extremely well voiced, mostly by actors I'm not that familiar with.The songs are attractive without being particularly memorable.There is an eye-mopping moment towards the end (unexpected, too) - take Kleenex.My only real criticism is that some of the accents are occasionally a bit impenetrable for those of us who aren't over familiar with New Orleans and Cajun speech.",The Princess and the Frog
14,anaconda-40658,The Princess and the Clichés.,5,5 February 2016,"The Princess and the Frog (2009): Dir: Ron Clements, John Musker / Voices: Anika Noni Rose, Bruno Campos, Keith David, Michael-Leon Wooley, Jim Cummings: A disappointing magical tale about the layers of beauty. A Prince is transformed into a frog by a voodoo magician and when waitress Tiana kisses him, she too becomes a frog. Directed by Ron Clements and John Musker who both collaborated on various animated projects including their biggest masterpiece, The Little Mermaid as well as Aladdin and Hercules. They are backed with colorful animation but terrible musical numbers. Anika Noni Rose voices the loyal Tiana who wishes to open her own restaurant. Even as a frog she demonstrates boldness in the face of adversary. Bruno Campos voices the Prince who is inexperienced in nearly everything. We realize that these two are meant to be but the humour counters predictable elements. Keith David has the misfortune of voicing the pathetically cardboard voodoo villain. Michael-Leon Wooley voices a jazz playing alligator. Why he can play music is not explained but his craving is for music, not people. Jim Cummings voices a firefly that fails to light up the screenplay beyond its formula delivery.

15,zetes,Disney shoots for their former glory and pretty much hit a bullseye,9,3 January 2010,"Disney goes old school in its first hand-drawn animated feature in five years. They pull out all the stops in this one to produce something like they used to make in the old days, and they've pretty much succeeded. I think we can forgive them if they occasionally try too hard. At least it never ends up seeming false. A hard-working New Orleans restaurant worker (voiced by Anika Noni Rose from Dreamgirls) hopes to open her own restaurant, a dream that she shared with her killed-in-action father. Concurrently, a layabout European prince (Bruno Campos) comes to town, having recently been cut off from his inheritance, looking for girls, parties and jazz. He runs into a voodoo master known as the Shadow Man (Keith David) who turns him into a frog. Trying to get a kiss from a princess, he brings Rose, who is merely dressed like a princess, down into frogdom, as well. What follows is a simple but beautiful journey through the bayous of Louisiana. Two comic relief animals join the frogs, a trumpet-playing gator and a Cajun firefly, but, amazingly, they add to the fun instead of seeming like a cheap ploy to keep children interested. The artwork is gorgeous, and Randy Newman provides a fine score and songs (I smell a second Oscar coming). This is a very satisfying film for any Disney fan, I would guess. It's every bit as great as their fine run in the late '80s and early '90s.",The Princess and the Frog
16,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Princess and the Frog,8,13 December 2009,"The Princess and the Frog may have gotten off the wrong foot with certain quarters who decide to see this through a tainted, racial prism, but what this film actually did, was to reaffirm that old school animation still has its place amongst CG and 3D offerings, bolstered by an impressive storyline, which is always important if to entertain children and the kids who accompany them.And Disney surely knows what it needed to do given its years of established experience to know what works, and what don't. Like most of its classics, it takes on a well known tell, and gives it its own Disney spin complete with a Happily Ever After. It's the same excellent spin applied on the frog prince who wants to be human again, and only so if kissed by a princess. The joke of course, is to have the princess turned into a frog, though no fault of her own because that's just what's needed to turn the classic on its head. We've had Disney-fied versions of tales from the little mermaid under the sea, to the Chinese Hua Mulan, and now, an ambitious African-American girl Tiana (voiced by Anika Noni Rose) determined to fulfill her father's dream of opening her own restaurant.Ron Clements who came up with this version of the story, deserves that pat on the back for its really wacky humour that got put into this tale, and the design of one of the most determined heroines in Disney's fold. Set in New Orleans, the first 20 minutes set the stage with its neat introduction and the back stories of every key character all spelled out, before mixing them up altogether to present that amphibious problem to solve, no thanks to a dash of black magic by Dr Facilier (Keith David) to turn a visiting Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) into a frog, although still keeping his glib tongue intact.And what is a Disney flick if it doesn't come with the requisite talking animals, and plenty of song and dance numbers? You'll be hard pressed not to like the firefly Ray (Jim Cummings) who pines after his Evangeline (a star by the way), or the Jazz crazy crocodile in Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley), whose only dream is to play with the humans, in front of a crowd, without scaring everyone away. But the one who steals the show each time she comes on, is that dumb blonde Charlotte (Jennifer Cody), the childhood friend of Tiana who grew up with that silver spoon in her mouth, where her demands no matter how ridiculous, will always get met. You cannot help but laugh at her naivety, and I suspect she just might get her own direct-to-DVD film soon enough.The message of the story's quite clear too, for everyone to clearly distinguish between a need and a want, which for the characters, and ourselves in real life, sometimes struggle to identify. It's feel good, although I was quite surprised with certain darker elements in the characters' battle against the chief villain, which while violence is shown off screen, the effect it has on kids still reverberate quite strongly. Then again, it wrapped itself up very neatly and clearly, one of the better animated films out there this year, standing proud that it's done in classical 2D, Disney style, through and through.",The Princess and the Frog
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Good ol' times, Disney is back!",9,5 May 2010,"Ah, 2D animation, how I've missed it. I feel awful for the new generation, it seems like they would never have the same experience that I had growing up with The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, or The Lion King. I always loved the 2D animation because of the hard work and love that goes into it, not to put down any of the recent Pixar or computer animation films, they're great too, just hand drawn is more special to me. So we have The Princess and the Frog, not only our first 2D animated film in years, but a breakthrough for Disney as we have a black princess. Disney has experimented with different cultures and races, but oddly no lead that was black and I think it was a great idea. I've been looking forward to seeing this movie, so when I was able to rent it, I didn't even hesitate putting it in my DVD player. Over all, I really did enjoy the movie, it had great animation, fun songs, and a good twist on an old fairy tale. I'm not sure if this will become a Disney classic down the line, but it was definitely worth the watch.A waitress and aspiring restaurant owner Tiana tries to fulfill her late father's dream in New Orleans. She is working two jobs just to save up enough money to secure the ideal building for her restaurant. Meanwhile, Prince Naveen has arrived in New Orleans determined to better his financial situation. After being cut off by his parents, Naveen is forced to marry a rich southern belle. It soon becomes obvious that Tiana's best friend and the rich sugar baron's daughter, Charlotte LaBouff, is the perfect candidate. Lurking in the shadows is voodoo master, Dr. Facilier. Angry at the neglect he receives from the rich and powerful, Facilier ropes the money-hungry Naveen and his emotionally abused sidekick, Lawrence, into a terrible scheme that involves turning Naveen into a frog. Lawrence, through the use of a voodoo talisman, adopts the prince's likeness and sets out to marry Charlotte with plans to split the money with Facilier who has some shady plans of his own. Thanks to an unfortunate circumstance and one magical kiss Tiana loses the bid to her dream restaurant and is transformed into a frog. In a moment of desperation, she strikes a deal with Naveen, which demands that after he marries Charlotte, he shall buy her restaurant. Things begin to change however, as the two mismatched frogs start to fall in love.I loved all the characters in this movie, Tiana kind of reminded me of Belle from Beauty and the Beast, very strong and independent, a great influence for little girls. A great comic relief came from Louis, the trumpet playing alligator, I loved his little story of how he first started playing the trumpet in front of humans and it didn't work out so well. Shadow made for a great villain, he had the best song in the film and was very creative as I'm glad he didn't have a goofy side kick, his scary shadows worked well with him. My only thing with the film is that for some odd reason it didn't really stand out to me like I thought it would, I kind of wished that Prince Naveen would have different reasons for why he was cut off by his parents, like maybe his love of jazz music and that's why he came to New Orleans. Now granted, it wouldn't have been able to help the story, but I just felt that him being a spoiled brat didn't work for me. It was so easy for us to buy the spoiled brat learning their lesson and hard work will help them get what the want, it's just too simple for me. I also found the ending to be a bit too sad for the kids, I don't want to spoil anything though. However, despite a couple of flaws, I really did enjoy the movie over all and it's a great family movie. 9/10",The Princess and the Frog
18,KineticSeoul,Disney 2D animation is back,8,14 February 2010,"This brought back a lot of good memories of Disney when 2D movies were actually really good as well. This film was just mesmerizing, and the 2D animation was amazing, even the music was great. I felt like a kid again and enjoyed every minute of it. Just about every characters in this movie was likable as well, even the villain. Every one did a good job with there roles, but Anika Noni Rose stood out the most for me despite playing the lead role of Tiana. The creators really brought there A game, cause it was just that memorable. This is a real cookie cutter princess film, but everything else in the movie is so good it's actually forgivable.

19,OllieSuave-007,A nice jazzy and New Orleans take on The Frog Prince.,8,23 March 2014,"This is Disney's 49th full-length animated feature film, set in the luscious and jazzy atmosphere of New Orleans, which tells the story of the arrogant and carefree Prince Naveen and hardworking waitress Tiana. Prince Naveen is transformed into a frog by a voodoo magician, and then Tiana kisses it, turning into a frog herself. With the help of a trumpet-playing alligator, a Cajun firefly and an old blind lady Naveen and Tiana must race against time to break the spell and fulfill their dreams.Ron Clements and John Musker, who did a superb job making ""The Little Mermaid,"" reunite to write and direct this film, giving the story an exciting touch that is full of adventure, magic and music. I think the filmmakers creativity in turning the classic story ""The Frog Prince"" with a New Orleans backdrop, with emphasis in jazz music and voodoo, is a clever approach, giving this movie its own unique flavor. Tiana being a waitress at a New Orleans restaurant gives the heroine a more elaborated purpose in the movie, in contrast to other heroines in Disney films which we commonly know as Princesses waiting for their Princes.The animation is hand-drawn, which I think gives the picture more beautiful sceneries and more vibrant colors, as opposed to the CGI work of some of the later Disney works in the 2000s.Overall, it's an entertaining and enjoyable Disney movie. It's not one that has that extra special ""Disney touch,"" but certainly better than many of the CGI animated ones that were released during the same time by other studios.Grade B",The Princess and the Frog
20,Buddy-51,still overly-familiar despite its original elements,5,1 October 2010,"""The Princess and the Frog"" has almost as much fun lampooning the conventions of the someday-my-prince-will-come genre as it does endorsing them. It inverts the formula right off the bat by having its heroine turn INTO a frog when she kisses one rather than the other way around. Tiana (Anika Nani Rose) also defies convention by being an African American heroine whose main ambition in life is to open up her own restaurant in the bustling metropolis of 1920s New Orleans. The last thing she's waiting around for is some old Prince Charming to come riding to the rescue, bringing meaning and purpose to her life.One would think that, with all this iconoclasm floating off the screen, ""The Princess and the Frog"" would be a more interesting and intriguing movie than it ultimately turns out to be. Yet, as though through some kind of reverse magical spell of its own, the more ""different"" the movie becomes, the more familiar it feels. Perhaps, the reason lies in the simple, old-school style of animation (cell as opposed to computer-generated) that the filmmakers have chosen to employ in this instance - or perhaps in the fact that this inverted fairy tale shtick has already been done so many times before, especially in the more imaginative and biting ""Shrek"" films, that it's bound to seem less than fresh here.Whatever the cause, ""The Princess and the Frog"" never quite lives up to its potential, ultimately becoming weighted down by a rambling storyline, a surfeit of less-than-fascinating subsidiary characters, an undistinguished Randy Newman score, and a stock villain – a shadowy practitioner of the Black Arts – who fails to generate any real quality of menace or threat (certainly not in a manner comparable to the great Disney bad guys of yore).",The Princess and the Frog
21,Lejink,Not riveting enough,4,23 April 2012,"As has been stated elsewhere, here we have an almost traditional Disney animated feature with Pixar nowhere to be found. The question is has Pixar changed the game in this field and is there still room for old 2-D traditional-style animation. Well of course there is but the other thing that Pixar has done is raise the bar where writing is concerned, which is where I think this film falls down. The story here boldly updates the old ""The Frog Princess"" story and for it seems largely musical purposes transplants the story to 1920's New Orleans, giving Randy Newman in the composer's chair free rein to pen a good selection of Southern music styles, which in fact makes the soundtrack one of the best things going here, I was less convinced by the rest of the movie.I found the portrayal of the black people (Tania and her family in the movie's prologue) to be a little patronising in the first place and the introduction of the disinherited, idle but of course handsome prince too contrived. Throw in the less than villainous Voodoo Man and his less than threatening shadow creatures, a weakish sub-plot where the prince's adviser impersonates him to win the hand of a rich jazz-age flapper and assorted cuter than cute crocodiles and fireflies so that it seemed this particular gumbo had too many ingredients and just didn't come together. There were some nice touches in the narrative, like the firefly's ultimately requited love for a star and the couple's return to human form only after the prince makes Tania literally a frog princess by marrying her, but for me there weren't enough jokes, excitement or even drama to really sustain my interest. I suppose in the final analysis this particular feature just kind of passed me bayou (sorry!).",The Princess and the Frog
22,ElMaruecan82,Such a well-written and realistic character as Tiana deserved better than being a frog for 70% of the runtime...,6,25 April 2021,"It is fully justified to consider ""The Princess and the Frog"" a milestone as the first Disney film to feature an African-American heroine: Tiana (Anika Noni Rose). Thinking about it, it took sixty years to get to the first non-White Disney Princess with Jasmin and the first Native heroine three years later (not counting Tiger Lily who had a rather small role in ""Peter Pan"") and she'd be followed by Esmeralda in ""The Hunchback of Notre-Dame"", now all these female characters had darker skins but there weren't of African background.Interestingly, the term ""African-American"" is totally appropriate as the cultural heritage of Tiana -as well as her ethnicity- bring (no pun intended) its color to the story which resets the famous Grimms' tale in New Orleans. And we sure get all archetypes (except for the Gospel): jazz, bayou, swamps, French-sounding names, Cajun accents, gumbo, the texture is so authentic that the prospect of Disney modernizing a classic fairy tale is as exciting as its revolutionary ""casting"". Two birds with the same stone... now, they could have used a traditional African tale as well, but the voodoo (over?)played in the film does borrow elements from the African heritage.And the film starts well: Tiana's mother Eudora (Oprah Winfrey) tells the original tale to Tiana and her friend Charlotte. Charlotte is dressed as a girl who's been brainwashed by Disney movies and the constant glee of a spoiled Daddy's girl who's got the latest Barbie. Tiana finds the frog story nauseating and has the most realistic reaction: ""Yukk"". And that's what I liked about Tiana: she felt real, writers made an effort to develop her as a person. Tiana is a waitress and a gifted cook whose dream is to open a restaurant, her Dad (Terrence Howard) tells her about the little star in the sky that fulfills your wishes but that doesn't diminish the value of hard work. Before ""Frozen"", Tiana was a right role-model and didn't need an on-the-nose dialogue to tell viewers what to do but the best thing to do.Tiana is a character who grows up in a sane family environment, Charlotte might be her best friend but growing up calling your father 'Big Daddy' has awkward resonances although he's indeed a big bear-like man voiced by John Goodman. Of course, Tiana's got to go through the usual patterns: her father dies during the Great War and in her environment, she's a misfit. Her background is regarded as a handicap to start a business on her own and she's surrounded by nay-sayers (including friends and her mother), she's an underdog and gives us a lot to root for. The film is set during the preparations of Mardi gras and the little town is ready to welcome the arrival of Prince of Moldania Naveem (Bruno Campos), it seems like a South-East Asian country and so in a way the prince is also a fine new step, though his resemblance to Prince Eric is startling.All goes well until the first little faux pas with the joyful introduction song. I guess it doesn't exactly sound like a compliment if you say it feels like a Randy Newman song, which means an umpteenth variation on ""You got a friend in me"". The townspeople obligatory song serves to introduces Doctor Facilier (Keith David) who looks like a cool animated version of Samuel L. Jackson with top hat and spats. Facilier makes a pact with Naveen and his servant Lawrence (Peter Bartlet); in the end, Naveen becomes a frog, it's a little complicated plot involving some pre-established deals with ghouls and whose only outcome is that Tiana mistakes him for a legitimate prince and then instead of getting him back to his normality, becomes a frog as well.Now, two things: Tiana as a person with human preoccupations was such an endearing character that the whole magical spell felt like a cheat. A second was: for once that you have a dark-skinned princess (and prince too) they spend most the time as frogs, which -let's face it- don't make for the best-looking creature despite the animators' effort to make them cute and appealing, and slightly less cartoonish than the singing frog in ""One Froggy Evening"". I understand that there had to be a frog, but the title is misleading ""The Princess and the Frog"" suggests that there's only one frog. So we got through a long middle-section set in the animal-world, one that lingers on extremely lengthy big musical lectures that don't offer many catchy themes to hum afterwards.Don't get me wrong: the visuals are stunning and the hand-drawn animation is a fine return to the roots but the swamps/night setting aren't the landscapes we expected no matter how hard they make the characters colorful: from Louis, the giant alligator (Michael-Leon Wooley) to Ray, the Cajun firefly (Jim Cummings) or the little witch Mama Odie (Jennifer Lewis), a blind woman and an extra-milestone for disabled characters. In the best case, the film looks like ""The Rescuers"" and doesn't live up to the potential showed during the first act.Maybe worse: even within the frog part, the chemistry between Tiana and Naveen seems too forced to be believable, one scene they berate each other and the next one, they fall in love for no particular reason. In fact, the whole frog / human magic is extremely confusing for we never know what powers have Facilier, even the whole ""kiss a princess"" premise has sets of rules that differ according to circumstances and when you have so many possibilities left, anything can happen anyway. When they become humans again, there was no way the Tiana we left would abandon herself to a Prince just like that. Now I understand why they made Anna the feminist heroine... but Tiana deserved a little more.",The Princess and the Frog
23,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Brilliance in the bayou.,8,1 October 2020,"'The Princess And The Frog (2009)' is about as classic as you can get in terms of its plot, a loose adaptation of 'The Frog Prince' by the Brothers Grimm. It's a story about want versus need, hard-work versus wishing and, of course, love. Although its narrative isn't exactly unpredictable, it's told in an effective and, even, affecting way right from its opening moments. Plus, the picture's setting and 2D style makes it stand-out straight away. It's a ton of fun, chock full of colourful characters and chuckle-worthy set-pieces. It hits every single note it needs to, often making surprisingly bold decisions and sticking to them. It has received some criticism for, essentially, ignoring race and the inherently racist attitudes of the time and place in which it's set (aside from one or two lines of dialogue). However, not all stories starring black characters have to grapple with issues surrounding racial inequality - even though it is, of course, an important area to explore. Even though it took them way too long, Disney finally has a black princess and she's one of the best in their repertoire. Overall, this beautifully animated film is entertaining and engaging. It's a shame that it didn't do too well at the box-office, as I'd love to see more like it. It's one of Disney's strongest efforts. 8/10",The Princess and the Frog

29,TheMovieDiorama,The Princess and the Frog flamboyantly leaps into Disney's classics.,7,7 April 2018,"A welcome return to the hand-drawn animation style that the studio is renowned for, this film marks the first musical since their Renaissance era. With that, you could say there is a sense of tangible nostalgia as it imitates the exact same structure as the classics before, thus consequently also being its downfall. A hard working waitress aspires to be a restauranteur where she encounters a talking frog who has been cursed by voodoo magic. Believed to be a prince, she kisses the amphibian and becomes a frog herself. A twisted adaptation of the famous fairy tale 'The Frog Prince', Disney have gone back to their roots and crafted a solidly entertaining musical. The animation is visually stunning as usual and makes a refreshing change from the lacklustre CG pictures the studio produced during the mid naughties. New Orleans is bustling with street musicians and a hearty community where you feel absorbed by the rustic watercolours of the signature architecture. Then, switching to a swampy bayou, allows the animators to differentiate between the human perspective of the urban town to the animal viewpoint of the rural marshlands. The protagonist Tiana holds her own with a hint of sassy independence that cements her as one of Disney's more memorable princesses. A myriad of supporting characters including a trumpet-playing alligator, firefly, hoodoo priestess, seamstress, frog hunters, a snake that is used as a guide stick, sugar mill owner and his daughter...I'm sure I'm forgetting more...oh, a valet, creepy stalking shadows and a dog. Highlighting the above is the major issue, there are far too many characters that do not have enough screen time to be developed or atleast memorable. I appreciated the antagonist who utilises voodoo magic to become a puppeteer as he manipulates several characters with curses. The story was well paced with little to no downtime. The musical numbers, whilst performed well, just weren't memorable. I think you've got my point, a wonderful yet unmemorable animation.",The Princess and the Frog

I breathe Horror to give you an idea.But as an objective reviewer, I went to the movies with my girlfriend to watch this movie. I've been a fan of Disney since forever.When the movie ended I kept telling to myself: ""Disney hasn't lost it"". They still have the special touch to make you laugh, cry, learn something, and even makes you reflex about some situations in daily life (like family, hard work to reach your goals, behavior, love, friendship, etc.).This movie, without being pretentious delivers several positive moral messages for children and parents.The love story is captivating and works perfect for the movie's tone. I really enjoyed the musical numbers but most of all, I truly dug the team work with all the colorful and funny characters. Ray was the highlight in my opinion. Charlotte was the funniest, while the Shadow Man was truly frightening.Call me crazy but I found some similarities between this movie and some Horror efforts such as ""Drag Me To Hell"" (the evil shadows led by The Shadow Man), ""The Serpent and the Rainbow"" (the voodoo stuff), and more. Maybe it's just me...The musical numbers were really great although we don't get a memorable number in the likes of ""Under the sea""; you get the idea.The animation is flawless. Don't think of a 2D cartoon like classic Disney. This is a breath taking ride with plenty of 3D and more special animation techniques. This is by far, one of the best looking movies of these kind.I say ""damn Disney"" because I nearly cry with you know, the ""sad"" scene (maybe it was because of my hang over), and then I was smiling with the mouth of the ocean with the satisfactory and tender ending.Oh these Disney guys really know how to manipulate your emotions.

32,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Devoted to kid-friendly warmth, ""Frog"" recaptures some of the old Disney magic",7,12 December 2009,"In a decade where CGI has dominated all animated forms of entertainment and a year where 3D has exploded into prime time, Walt Disney Studios steps back, reaches into its old bag of tricks and pulls out its first hand-drawn feature in five years. The decision might feel like a ploy to boost Disney merchandising with a new princess, but Disney has made plenty movies that achieve that end only they don't have half heart and soul poured into them that ""The Princess and the Frog"" does. Dedicated to moral-focused storytelling and creating lovable characters, Disney has rediscovered a touch of its former magic and delivered an age- appropriate children's film -- it's best effort of this kind since 1998's ""Mulan"" and maybe even ""The Lion King."" Complete with musical numbers, this is Disney's old formula executed to a T. Princesses, wishing upon stars, a journey with new friends being made along the way, danger, transformation, talking animal sidekicks -- there's no question Disney wanted desperately to recreate the feeling of its classics. Set in Jazz Age New Orleans, Tiana is a dedicated young woman with a knack for cooking who aspires to open up her own restaurant one day and do the memory of her father proud. She knows all about the value of hard work when it comes to achieving one's dreams. Already, here is Disney making it clear that it wants to teach children a valuable lesson above all else.The sacrifice made for that is adult-level humor. Whereas Disney threw in numerous jokes back in mid-'90s that flew over kids' heads, there's maybe only a handful of those chuckles in ""Frog."" Make no mistake, this one is for kids. Disney nostalgists will enjoy it too -- but the focus is kids. Lots of run-of-the-mill physical humor and talking animals acting silly: most of the time you'll laugh because it's cute and sweet.The plot is okay. The foreign Prince Naveen comes to New Orleans and he has a run in with a hoodoo-voodoo witch doctor, the sinister Dr. Facilier (ala James Bond villain Baron Samedi in ""Live and Let Die""), who in a spooky, smoky flash-bang big-band music number promises him wealth (princes can get cut off by their parents you know) and also his mutton-chopped assistant princely fame. Planning to use them as pawns of his own devise, he turns Naveen into a frog and the assistant into Naveen. The frog Naveen finds Tiana and promises that if she kisses him, he'll make her restaurant dream come true. When she agrees, she ends up a frog too. Together, they journey through the Louisiana Bayou in hopes to find Mama Odie, who will have the power to turn them human again. Along the way they meet a cuddly trumpet-playing crocodile named Louis (after Mr. Armstrong, naturally) and a goofy Cajun firefly named Ray. Its when Louis and the frog Tiana and Naveen sing about what they'll do when they become human (""When We're Human"") as they float down the river that suddenly you feel that old fuzzy Disney musical feeling and ""Princess and the Frog"" becomes a success.Randy Newman's tunes are catchy and fun, representing a range of Southern music from jazz (""When We're Human) to banjo-plucking folk (""Gonna Take You There"") to the film's best song, Mama Odie's moral-delivering number asking us all to ""Dig A Little Deeper"" in full gospel fashion. The last one aside, they're not all that memorable, however, most likely because they never give in to full theatricality. There just feels like a little reservation in making ""Frog"" an all-out musical jamboree on Newman's part as well as longtime Disney directors Ron Clements and John Musker. For many adult Disney-lovers, it might be the difference between a ""cute"" and a ""great"" Disney film.Certainly, however, even if just in brief moments, Disney has tapped into the magic of old with this heart-warming story preaching that our personal dreams and desires don't mean nearly as much if they lose sight of love and family. It even manages to be pleasantly less predictable than one would expect in the end and it also avoids some past warranted Disney criticisms with regards to racism and stereotyping gender roles. Kids will love it (one girl in the theater was even dancing in the aisle ... out of plain sight of course) and parents will feel good about taking them to see it. A definite success for Disney.~Steven CVisit my site at www.moviemusereviews.com",The Princess and the Frog
33,Vartiainen,Neat but hollow,7,27 June 2016,"Disney returns to hand-drawn princess fairy tale animation after a stint of Pixar-esque computer animated films. This time the inspiration being the classic tale of The Frog Prince by Brothers Grimm. But, being Disney, they throw their own spin on it. The story takes place in 1920s New Orleans and features Disney's first African-American princess in Tiana.I really like the setting a lot. New Orleans is a fantastic setup for this particular story, with its African-American culture, voodoo, bayou environment and all the music it inspires. Tiana and Dr. Facilier, the villain, are both fantastic characters and fully fleshed-out by the film. Dr. Facilier especially is very memorable and has one of the better villain songs in the entire canon. Charlotte, Tiana's childhood rich kid friend, is also absolutely hilarious.Unfortunately, the story isn't quite that good. It feels more like Disney going through motions than it feels a proper fairy tale. We have the setup, the twist, the journey, the final battle, but you can practically see the story boards being switched behind the scenes. You don't buy the illusion. Plus, the songs are not that hot. The villain song is very good, and Almost There is not half bad either, but the rest are garbage. Especially Dig a Little Deeper, which is so painfully Oscar-crappy that you can't help but cringe.All in all The Princess and the Frog is a mixed package. Its heart is in the right place and I love that we had this one final traditionally animated princess film, but it could have been a lot better, if we're being completely honest. Objectively a fine film, but not up to Disney's usual standards.",The Princess and the Frog
34,lisafordeay,Thank god Disney is back on track.but still it could have been a bit better,7,20 September 2010,"Since Disney decided to not do 2D animation anymore I was heartbroken as I grew up watching the likes of The Little Mermaid,The Lion King,Pocahuntas,Aladdin the list goes on. But when I heard in 2009 that there was a new Disney princess coming and its in 2D animation I was over the moon. The film takes place in the 1920s in New Orleans where a waitress named Tiana(who is African American)dreams of opening up her own restaurant. Meanwhile a womanizing playboy prince named Naveen comes to town with his henchman Lawerance(who looks an awful lot like Nathanial from Enchanted) and he visits a voodoo doctor named Dr Faciller who is the baddie in this film and he turns Naveen into a frog and Lawerance into Naveen who is so sick and tired of Naveen's life he wants to be him.Of course they use his blood so that he will look exactly like him. The real Naveen sees Tiana who is at the masquerade ball and he asks her to turn him back into a prince. Problem is she isn't a princess and when she kisses him she turns into a frog and as the two don't get along they soon find themselves well you guessed it falling in love with one another. So they go on an adventure where they meet a jazz loving alligator, a firefly named Ray aka Raymond who loves a falling star named Evangeline and a hilarious blind woman named Mama Odie.Packed with great jazz music and a great cast the only thing that it lacks is the awful ending I'm sure some people agree with me for saying it but it wasn't as exciting as Aladdin or The Little Mermaid.Also the songs aren't that memorable for me AT ALL they just come in one ear and out the other.If you seen Swan Princess which is from New Line Cinema(with the frog),Cats don't dance(for the jazzy music and of course Randy Newman who was the composer for this film) or Anastasia(well I think its kinda similar cause the two don't get along at first) then this is for you.I'll give it a 7/10 as it lacks near the end of the film.",The Princess and the Frog
35,dee.reid,A classic fairy tale,10,14 December 2009,"Reflecting back on the new animated Disney film ""The Princess and the Frog,"" I remember that much about it still remains fresh in my mind, which is rare for most movies nowadays, animated or live-action. (It's also the first animated feature I've seen this year that I felt was well worth the inflated $8.25 ticket price.) But with ""The Princess and the Frog,"" I remember that the characters, the story and the simple, hand-drawn animation are all something to really cherish, in this groundbreaking animated feature (I'll tell you why it's so groundbreaking, if you don't know already) from co-directing team John Musker and Ron Clements and loosely based on the 21st-century novel ""The Frog Princess"" by E.D. Baker (which itself was loosely inspired by ""The Frog Prince"" by the Brothers Grimm).Remembering the animation again, in an age where computers are capable of the most complex animation of the theatrical kind, traditional hand-drawn animation seems almost like a lost and/or dying art-form. That is not so with ""The Princess and the Frog."" Even though the hand-drawn drawing style will almost certainly date the film in 10 or 20 years, there's just something truly remarkable about ""The Princess and the Frog's"" simplicity.And if you haven't figured out by now why this film is so groundbreaking for Disney (or perhaps any animated film for that matter), ""The Princess and the Frog"" features the debut of the first black American princess. This princess is Tiana (Anika Noni Rose). Of course, she wasn't born into royalty; that won't happen until the very end. She lives in a poor, predominantly black section of 1920s New Orleans, Louisiana, and works two jobs as a waitress, trying her hardest to earn enough money so she can open up her dream restaurant.She is a responsible, clear-headed young woman who knows that in order to get what you want in this world, you have to be willing to work your hardest. And even though this is a Disney and it's rated ""G"" for no objectionable material, the racial hardships that most blacks living in the American South, especially Louisiana, while somewhat muted in this film, are still visible/audible for those eagle-eyed viewers who are aware of the racial turmoil in the pre-Civil Rights era South.The plot gets underway with the arrival of Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos), a quasi-French-speaking hunk who hails from the fictional European nation of Maldonia, in New Orleans on the eve of the annual Mardi Gras celebrations. He provides an interesting contrast to Tiana: he's broke, because he was financially cut off from his parents, lazy, and has no valuable skills to help him out in the real world. So he figures that his only ticket back into money is to get married, which is why he is in New Orleans in the first place.Anyway, a chance encounter with the evil voodoo priest Dr. Facilier (Keith David) transforms Prince Naveen into a frog. A chance meeting with Tiana one night also turns her into a frog after she kisses him, and the two set off on an adventure into the Lousiana bayou to try to find a cure, and they both learn a few valuable things about life, love, and each other along the way. Meanwhile, Dr. Facilier plots to get his hands back on Prince Naveen in order to facilitate his plot to take over all of New Orleans, with a little help from his allies in the demonic underworld.Let me just say that this is a much better film than I expected it to be. While I cannot often use the words ""intelligent"" and ""Disney film"" in the same sentence, I feel that I can when describing ""The Princess and the Frog"": it is an intelligent, funny, and moving animated Disney film. Although I am way outside this film's key demographic - I am a 24-year-old black male - I nonetheless looked forward to this film with great enthusiasm, and I wasn't the slightest bit disappointed.Everything about the movie soars - the voice-acting performances, the music (yes, the music, and I usually don't like musicals), the story, the characters, the animation and it's messages about hard work to get what you want in life, true love, and getting what you need vs. what you want. Lastly, while the movie is rated ""G,"" I would also like to comment that this film is actually pretty dark and kind of scary in certain places, which is something I felt should have earned the film a higher ""PG"" rating. (Still, I doubt that it's anything that will ever give your kids nightmares.) It's also quite interesting to note how much it pays attention to New Orleans culture, everything from the food to the music to the atmosphere, to the general way of life of people living in the Big Easy. It's just another great little tidbit you could pick up from watching one of the greatest animated features in Disney history.""The Princess and the Frog"" is a groundbreaking animated feature from the last place I ever expected to put out something that could ever possibly be groundbreaking in the first place. I highly recommend it to anyone to watch and enjoy.""The Princess and the Frog"" is only one of the greatest animated Disney movies of all time. If you don't see it, you'll only end up regretting it for the rest of your life.10/10",The Princess and the Frog
36,GiraffeDoor,I'm glad it exists. But still...,7,2 December 2019,"In the late 2000s a lot of little girls and at least one teenage boy (me, I am this boy) were anxious if Disney would ever make a proper Princess Movie again. Enchanted lived up to its name but, you know, we needed something oldschool yet made for generation Y (or was it Z by then? I gave up when ""millennial"" became an ageist slur).This was good. I think it really helped us come to terms with the idea that the Princess movie had run its course and anything new would just be derivative. Again, like I said: this wasn't bad. It just falls short of being a classic.This movie, despite it's rather juvenile middle (with more than a few lame gags) is book ended with with a really heartfelt story of a confident young woman making a life for herself despite the odds. Weirdly, the whole thing kind of loses its magic once the magic spells come into it. Funny.What really makes this fun to watch is the rich sense of local colour and culture. The Louisiana flavour is so cool, partly for us having a Disney movie that draws from the heritage of its own culture, but because it gives exposure to this delicious scene incorporating fantastic music and visual style within the aesthetic framework it has chosen.The Villain is at once fresh and classic. He is kind of funny but also really terrifying and he has the best song. The other songs are good. But that's all I will say about them.Like I said, it's good. There are a lot of really well visualized and executed moments. But a movie is more than a sequence of good moments. I think by this point they were sort of trying to imitate the movie of a past time and forget how to give their picture that X-factor.But then Tangled Happened which makes this movie just a fascinating experiment.I respect it and I quite like it.But I don't love it.",The Princess and the Frog

It's nothing incredibly different from the studio's other animated princess films, but still produces what you'd want from a film of this type.Anika Noni Rose works well in the lead role as Tiana, while it's pleasant to hear John Goodman as Big Daddy; albeit not as a major character. Keith David (Shadow Man) and Oprah Winfrey (Eudora), meanwhile, are welcomed cast members.The music is rather forgettable, though the (traditional) animation is nice. There's a few moments where it drags its heels slightly, but the pacing is mostly fine. It all comes down to whether you enjoy princess stories, given how predictable and formulaic they are. I'm nonplussed about them, to be honest.Mid-range Disney, for me.",The Princess and the Frog
38,3xHCCH,A Triumph of Story but Derivative Visuals,7,11 February 2010,"The previews of this latest Disney 2D outing had not really been that inviting for me. It did not really help also that of late, Disney movies had not really been up to their usual par, from ""The Emperor's New Groove"" to ""Brother Bear"" to ""Home on the Range,"" nothing really exciting. So I was not really looking forward to seeing ""Princess and the Frog"", not until it earned Oscar nominations last week. So, my expectations were not really very high.""The Princess and the Frog"" takes the classic Grimm fairy tale ""the Frog Prince"" and gives it a Disney twist, set in the Jazz Age in New Orleans. While the trailer might look discouragingly corny, the actual film plays out very well as a whole. It had all the Disney staples on it: the feisty heroine, the good-looking leading man, the sinister villain, the earnest songs, the lovable sidekick characters. But importantly, there is a very good story arc. And that elusive vital quality of ""heart"" is very much in there. The ending will definitely bring a tear or so to your eyes.However, for all of us loyal Disney audiences, it is also very disconcerting that most of the characters and scenes look derivative from other Disney films. Tiana looked and moved like Belle (of ""Beauty and the Beast""). Naveen is reminiscent of Prince Eric (of ""The Little Mermaid""). Facilier was drawn with facial lines like Hades (of ""Hercules""). Most glaringly, the firefly Raymond is a virtual reincarnation of Chi Fu, the general's aide in ""Mulan"". The background scenes that accompanied the songs remind us of ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"" from ""The Lion King"" and ""Kiss the Girl"" from ""The Little Mermaid."" As a whole, though, ""The Princess and the Frog"" favors more the female demographic. There isn't much for the male audience here, especially the young boys. The attention of my two sons could not be held for long. Nevertheless, overall, this is a triumph for the Disney studio. This film has indeed successfully brought the Disney franchise back to its ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" glory days.",The Princess and the Frog

From John Musker and Ron Clements, who took Disney out of the dark age in the eighties with The Little Mermaid, comes a jazzy, weird and wacky fairy tale good for the familyThe story takes us to 19th century New Orleans, in a fashion similar to the beginning of Beauty and the Beast. As it continues, the film plays out in a similar manner, with a dash of Little Mermaid, a drop of Aladin, and some original musical numbers, which are impossible to make out over the accents.

Rather try and reinvent themselves they have stayed too close to other ""princess"" movies. The villain, the comical sidekicks etc. It all smells like a bit of desperation. Disney can hardly be blamed, their 3D efforts were slated and the previous few 2D animations were all of questionable quality. The animation is fantastic and the voodoo sequences are wonderful. Keith David makes for a brilliant villain, with his seedy voice rasping through the film. Like many of it's kind before it, the villain is the star, with the most personality and memorable moments.

Prince Naveen is transformed into a frog by a conniving voodoo magician and Tiana, following suit, upon kissing the amphibian royalty. With the help of a trumpet-playing alligator, a Cajun firefly, and an old blind lady who lives in a boat in a tree, Naveen and Tiana must race to break the spell and fulfill their dreams.TP&TF has something natural that mostly other animated movies do not: Hand-drawn animation! Remember the olden days where THE LION KING and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and other hand-drawn movies once ruled the world? Me neither. Well, luckily for us, a group of people decided remind us of how animation was once like, not forgetting to add something called a plot and characters in the process.The 2D animation is quite wonderful to see. You can tell that the animators worked the picture with care and effort, bombarding the film with a wondrous, visual imagery that could sweep any human being off his or her feet. As for the characters, I liked Tania, the new Disney princess, a lot because she didn't feel like a cartoon character. She felt like a real human being with her own flaws and strengths. Prince Naveen (of Maldonia) wasn't so bad either. I adored the other characters as well. Ray (the firefly) and Louis (the alligator) both brought in a lot of charm into the film.As for the inevitable songs sung throughout the film, I enjoyed them very much, although two or three seemed to be memorable. The musical numbers are also lively, not to mention the film itself, and colorful as always. Overall, the film is charming and funny but also heartwarming and touching. There's no need for 3D here, people. It's old school storytelling, and it's a breath of fresh air. Both adults and kids should be entertained when watching this film.",The Princess and the Frog

As expected, some pious Christians disliked the voodoo nonsense. Extremely well-drawn in traditional 2D animation. Lush backgrounds. Typical talking Disney animals. I have never before seen a ""frog princess"" wearing eye shadow and mascara! Louis The jazz-trumpet-playing 'gator is both a silly and wonderful character. The Randy Newman songs do not disappoint but are not in the same league as ""Beauty and the Beast"" (and other Disney musical classics) by a long shot. It passes the ""collection test"" as I just saw it for the first time in 10 years, and I already want to see it again. Of course it comes nowhere ""near"" Disney's traditional masterpieces, but it it still quite a fun and enjoyable experience. A great ending as everyone lives ""happily ever after"".

Looks like classic Disney, but might require a talk before you see it?",4,18 January 2010,"Pretty, charming, and traditional animation, the songs are good - but my review really centers around the concern: is this G movie age appropriate?I'm not convinced that tarot and blood sacrifice, demons, and witchcraft have a place in Disney. I'm not being a killjoy here, some of the images are full-on, but perhaps it should be seen as a chance to talk to your child BEFORE rather than after the event (As we had to....)We seem to have either ridiculously juvenile films or ridiculously scary films. My three kids six, four, and four had to be taken out of the theater they were crying and one was really screaming and had trouble sleeping. They LOVED the Princess, she is really wonderful, but really we couldn't see why the plot might involve a conflict/tension (As it should, of course)with the Shadow Man that was initially fun then downright terrifying. I am not putting any spoilers here just a personal opinion: I think it is a caveat that needs to be said.This may be fun for the Harry Potter crowd but younger viewers could be in for a shock.Why Disney can't make the villains like Pixar does defeats me: why so over the top; is the Art Director really saying it's their job to go: let's make him scarier, let's really do that, let's see if we can get them to cry? I'm thinking of the Sound of Music, or Jane Austin, where the ""Villains"" turn out to be those who have forgotten what it means to care to love and to cherish. Why should my children's childhood memories be spolied. They will not remember the wonderful jazz or the pathos of the firefly or the moral that effort = reward, they have just dark images left. That's just not fair, and it is certainly NOT Disney.A great shame: all other characters are delightful, the frogs were charming and hopped creatively etc; I only missed the last 10 minutes and I have been told how it goes; all in all a great attempt to revive classic Disney totally spoiled by either a total lack of self-awareness and or worse, a deliberate calculation that is really out of step with modern parents. I don't know how you feel but my kids don't need to be more scared about growing up, and the darker magic arts, they'll get all of the vampires and ghouls and dark magic shoved at them by other teenagers anyway in just a few years, for now we'd like to let them feel the world is a safer place with films like the Frog Princess.I hope Disney will make more real cinematic 2D films for the big screen they are outstanding in a way that TV cannot reproduce; but next time I hope that there will be a serious attempt ask where the marketing line lies. Do they want tweenies 7/8-11 and not the 3-7 crowd. The younger group are the obsessives and want the lunch-boxes, pyjamas, and books. The older will just move on instantly to the next thing etc;I don't want soppy, sentimental, but neither do I want borderline horror.Come on Disney give us a film we can ALL enjoy!",The Princess and the Frog
46,MartianOctocretr5,"Sincere theme, lots of heart, appealing characters",8,2 May 2010,"Disney goes with their retro classic animation style, frequently spiced with exuberant song-and-dance numbers. The nostalgic look is accomplished with panache, and the tribute to New Orleans' music genres is great sing-along material.The Princess and the Frog is a very genuinely told tale, with a lot of heart. The script wisely keeps modern pop culture jokes out of the mix, and opts to paint an authentic time period setting, 1920's New Orleans. The characters are an appealing mix, including this studio's patented friendly animal allies, and bone-chilling villain. The latter looks like a male version of Cruella DeVille, and is in league with dark phantoms even Cruella might find repulsive. The heroes are perfect counterpoints: the family-privileged Daveen, and the poor but dedicated to her dream Tiana. The gator Louis and firefly Ray rise above being just comic-relief side kicks. Louis is a wonderful tribute to Louis Armstrong, and the firefly is just a cool friend to have around in a crisis. His zydeco ""Bayou"" song was my personal favorite from the many featured songs. The story sends up several clever plot twists, leading to a nice outcome. One of the characters (not who you would expect) is granted one of the happiest endings of all time.Cautions/minor flaws to note: there are scary wraiths that appear to be culled from the movie Ghost, and might give smaller children nightmares. There is some violence that might frighten kids, too. What the villain goes to so much trouble to get isn't very clear. The early part of the film develops solid foundation, but this forces things to move slowly at first. Further, the movie has a lot of songs to perform, and the frequency that which they are used often slows things at the outset, too. However, at the point when Tiana and the frog meet for the first time, the film kicks into high gear, and it's worth the wait.Entertaining film with a nice theme.

47,Troy_Campbell,"A refreshingly old-school tale of love, death and a trumpet-playing alligator.",8,4 January 2010,"This is vintage Disney at work. Opting for the traditional hand-drawn animation, the Mouse House is able to capture the spirit of past greats like Snow White and Pinocchio and insert it into a modern day template. Like the best Disney efforts there is a strong moral centre wrapped in laughs and tears, allowing the film to work on so many levels. Depending on how old you, or your children, are there are various things to take from Princess and the Frog, making it a worthy movie for any age. Will the pre-schoolers pick up on the message of race division that simmers below the surface? No, but you will. Will you laugh at the three slapstick hunters that try and capture our slippery, web-footed duo? Nope, but the pre-schoolers will.The elegantly sketched visuals and superbly layered screenplay are complimented perfectly by the stellar musical numbers. From the scary – the voodoo doctor summoning evil spirits – to the humorous – Louis, Naveen and Tiana floating down the river on the way to Mama Odie – the song and dance routines are delivered with style, intelligent lyrics and, most importantly, emotion. Thankfully they don't overdo it and the songs always feel in support of the story, not in place of.Whilst there are an abundance of memorable characters – Louis the lovable alligator, Ray the romantic firefly, Mama Odie the eccentric witch-doctor, Charlotte the rambunctious rich kid, Dr. Facilier the black-magic practitioner - Prince Naveen is easily the standout. Bruno Campos' instantly classic voice performance - Antonia Banderas eat your heart out - is the cornerstone of Naveen's undeniable coolness; all the froggettes want him and all the frogs want to be him. Tiana is nowhere near as iconic although I suspect she is the ideal woman, independent and determined, to provide the young girls in the audience a role model. She's not as funny as Naveen though, so there.

That film was announced to be Disney's last theatrically released traditionally animated feature ever, and by the time I watched it, there still hadn't been any theatrically released films from the company animated in this way, and I was convinced it was still intended to remain the last one of its kind for good. That was not a good thing, since that film is so lacklustre and forgettable, but less than a year after I watched it, ""The Princess and the Frog"" came into theatres, and it turned out that the 2004 flop didn't mark the end of an era after all. This 2009 film appeared to be much more popular than its predecessor, so I was obviously expecting it to be far superior, and after seeing it, I would say it is.Tiana is a very hard-working waitress in New Orleans who is trying to save up enough money to open her own restaurant. In her childhood, her father told her his dream of having his own restaurant, but he unfortunately died before he could make that happen, leaving his daughter determined to fulfill his dream. Meanwhile, Prince Naveen of Maldonia has been cut off financially by his parents, and has come to New Orleans to try and get rich again. He meets a voodoo witch doctor named Dr. Facilier, and thinks this man can help him get what he wants, but this is just part of a scheme, and the evil magician turns Naveen into a frog! Tiana attends a masquerade ball hosted by her best friend, Charlotte LaBouff, and Naveen shows up on the balcony. He convinces Tiana to kiss him so she can lift the curse, but instead of turning him back into a human, this turns her into a frog! The two of them then flee to the bayou, where they make friends but also face more than one problem, while Dr. Facilier intends have the frog prince tracked down, as he will need him in order for his scheme to succeed! Most recent animated movies may be computer animated ones with amazing animation, but this particular traditionally animated one also proves to be a visual treat, with some very nice backgrounds, especially for the bayou. I'll admit that the story has its fairly dull moments, and I couldn't always get into it, but ""The Princess and the Frog"" definitely has a better plot than ""Home on the Range"", one which I usually found intriguing, and this is just of the things that makes it better than that previous film. The story also gets memorably touching around the end. Also, this 2009 Disney feature does SO much better with the humour and characters than its 2004 predecessor. I actually laughed many times while watching this most recent traditionally animated Disney flick, with scenes such as Tiana's reaction to hearing Naveen (as a frog) talk for the first time, and with such characters as Louis, a friendly alligator whom Tiana and Naveen meet in the bayou and are joined by on their journey. The Charlotte LaBouff character is at times pretty funny, and maybe sometimes close to annoying as well. The characters here generally stand out, which I certainly cannot say about Disney's dull animated western. I can understand the praise for the songs in ""The Princess and the Frog"" as well.Since I didn't know this film, or any future piece of traditional animation from Disney, was coming when I watched ""Home on the Range"", and until around the time this follow-up was released, I didn't think any ever would, I was obviously thinking about how this film would be in comparison before seeing it. I had seen the significant difference in ratings here, so I was expecting ""The Princess and the Frog"" to show a major rise in quality after the cartoon western from several years earlier, and watching it did not prove be wrong. ""Brother Bear"", Disney's last traditionally animated feature before ""Home on the Range"", is pretty good, but I would say this one is probably even better than that. Obviously, not ALL Disney fans would be impressed with this particular effort, but it's clearly much more popular than what was previously intended to be the company's last theatrically released traditionally animated film, which should count for something. It also seems to be considered by many to be a good tribute to New Orleans, after the city was sadly ravaged by Hurricane Katrina.",The Princess and the Frog

You could have said that 11 years ago when this film came out and you'd still be correct. CGI's takeover was nearly. Today, the art of the hand-drawn animated movie, especially from Disney, is as dead as it will ever be. Not only is that a shame, its a crime. While time consuming, hand-drawn animation produces some of the most beautiful character and production designs you'll ever see. Going back to the Little Mermaid, or even as far back as Snow White, the level of emotion and soul in storytelling is far more prominent and powerful in this medium. If there was one company known for having mastered it, it was Disney. These movies look so soft and gentle, almost as if God himself created them for us. Movies that place us in times and spaces beyond our imagination and that tell us stories we only could imagine in our minds before bedtime. The Princess and the Frog is one of those movies. A throwback to a classic era, as well as a tribute to a great American city and the great people that live there.

Because this is what I see as Disney. I have a distinct preference for traditional animation, not that Disney later made brilliant movies in CGI, but I have always told myself that CGI was Pixar's territory. The Princess and the Frog goes back to the fairy-tale, the musical, the animation, everything is really well done and most certainly Disney. I had a blast watching it. The romance is the most real since Beauty And The Beast if you ask me. Tiana and Prince Naveen take their time developing their relationship which brings us the awkwardness of being in love, dealing with each other's flaws etc. That is great! Tiana is also the most progressive female lead in the Disney Princess catalog since Belle. The first African American princess with sky- high ambitions and hard work to back make her dreams come true! Great! I also liked the supporting characters. Charlotte was hilarious! Some may say annoying, but I found her really funny and a great contrast to Tiana. Dr. Facilier was a well made mystical voodoo man with the greatest villain song since Hunchback! That song is the easily Randy Newman's greatest creation. All characters are voiced beautifully. Ray (Jim Cummings) and Dr. Facilier (Keith David) are my favorites. After all this praise, which I think the movie deserves, I must add the general consensus about one central flaw in it. The story too complicated to be a true classic all the way through. I love the colourful animation, the characters, the music, the message and I can accept the complicated story, but that one thing keeps it away from a 10. But watch it!

It's a bit light on plot, the songs aren't memorable, and it's too bad that the highly intriguing villain, Dr. Facilier, was not made better use of. But these are minor complaints. Go see it. Bring the family.Tiana is Disney's first African American lead princess, and she's fully worthy of her crown. Tiana is a sturdy, hard working, reliable, talented, and very, very beautiful girl. One can only hope that little girls will want to grow up just like Tiana. The New Orleans of this film is very beautiful, as is the Bayou.Dr. Facilier is a very interesting villain. He's a voodoo practitioner who uses African masks to make magic. Some will object to this use of African masks. The movie should have used more of him. He needs a backstory and a female accomplice and motivation. It would have been cool to have an extended showdown scene between Tiana and Dr. Facilier.The lead couple, Tiana and Prince Naveen, are frogs for much of the movie, and that limits the engagement you can feel with them. The plot gets lost in the Bayou and introduces a character, Mamma Odie, who doesn't add much. A firefly named Ray is adorable. The movie really needed some scenes where Tiana and Naveen's connection was more emphasized, and where Tiana got to create her own destiny, rather than just allow a bunch of sidekicks to take over the movie.",The Princess and the Frog
54,ja_kitty_71,2D is coming back to Disney,10,25 December 2009,"I'm glad that 2D animation is coming back to Disney, because as I said: I grew up with the 2D Classics and I'll always love them for years to come. I mean 3D's great and all, but it's artistically beautiful as 2D. I think the animation is beautifully done; the music is awesome. After seeing it, the film instantly became one of my favorite new millennium Disney animated features, along with Atlantis: The Lost Empire, Treasure Planet, Brother Bear and Home on The Range. The film retells the age-old ""Frog Prince"" story - with a slight twist. This story starts in New Orléans in the 1920s. A young woman named Tiana works two jobs. Yes, she works two waitress jobs: one at night and one during the day. She works to earn money to own a restaurant, because it was her and departed dad's dream of owning their very own restaurant.One day, during her day-shift, her rich best friend Charlotte LeBouff is excited because Prince Naveen of Maldonia is coming to New Orléans, and is invited to her family estate for a masquerade party. Then Charlotte pays Tiana for catering at party. Excited by the amount of dollars Charlotte had given her, Tiana was sure she got the money to the buy the old sugar mill and transform it into her dream restaurant. For the next part of the story, yes, Prince Naveen did arrive in New Orléans. But not just for an invite to a masquerade party, but to marry Charlotte LeBouff for her dad's fortune. You see, his royal parents cut him off for his spoiled, play-boy, jazzy lifestyle. While on the streets with his butler Lawrence, they come across a voodoo magician Dr. Facilier referred as ""The Shadowman."" Facilier invites the men into his emporium, and cuts a deal with the Voodoo gods for the special powers that will enable him to turn Naveen into a frog. Then uses a voodoo talisman to fill Naveen's blood with to make Lawrence look like Naveen to marry Charlotte. Meanwhile, while working at the LeBouff's grand masquerade party, Tiana learns that someone else put down a higher offer on the old sugar mill, and is now left with nothing unless she can top him after Mardi Gras; that is just bull-s**t! Having given up hope, she desperately wishes on the evening star, when Naveen-the-frog appears. Thinking that she is a princess, for she is costumed as one, he convinces her to kiss him to break the curse and turn him back into a human again, but the spell backfires (because Tiana is not really a princess) and Tiana becomes a frog as well. And then, the two are chased out and head for the bayou, as Lawrence impersonates Naveen. But the talisman, filled with Naveen's blood, slowly starts to drain away. So Doctor Facilier sends out his shadows to retrieve the prince. In the bayou, Tiana and Naveen encounter Louis, an alligator who wants to become human so he can be a jazz musician and Ray, a Cajun firefly who is in love with the evening star (whom he has named Evangeline), which he thinks is another firefly. They take them to see Mama Odie, the good but eccentric voodoo priestess of the swamp. That's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends.This is one of Disney's best films! And I think Dr. Facilier should join other great Disney villains like Chernabog (Fantasia), Maleficent (Sleeping Beauty) and Judge Frollo (The Hunchback of Notre Dame). To me the Dr. is like someone out of a story to scare kids into being good, like: ""Don't stay up late, or the Shadowman will get you."" ""Eat your vegetables, or the Shadowman will get you."" Or...""Come inside now! or I will tell the Shadowman."" So my last word is that this film is awesome!",The Princess and the Frog
55,itamarscomix,Charming,7,23 September 2011,"Whether or not it's more racially enlightened than classic Disney films - personally, I wasn't too bothered by the slick, slightly watered down, PC take on racial issues, which is all that I expected from them - The Princess and the Frog is a charming piece of film, and the first one in many years that resembles the magic of Disney's Renaissance era, that of the late 80's and early 90's. It could be argued that it's not necessarily a good thing - the main characters are cookie-cutter copies of the ones from previous Disney cartoons. But to me it felt less like watching a rip-off or a rehash and more like a family reunion, and it left me feeling all fuzzy and warm.The morals of the story, too, are basic Disney material, and they could be considered hypocritical or superficial, but only if you choose to be cynical about it. I preferred to let myself be immersed in the charm and the warmth, in the beautiful, loving rendition of the most glorious era of New Orleans, in the sweet and lovable animal characters, and in Randy Newman's always gorgeous score. The Princess and the Frog is not a masterpiece, nor is it Disney repenting for every semi-racist notion they ever had in the past - rather, it's a lovely, lively and very enjoyable movie for the whole family, and if you let yourself do so you're sure to enjoy it.",The Princess and the Frog
56,brookenichole-98054,Beautiful,9,15 June 2020,"Every since I first watched this movie I have found myself loving it every time. The story is heartwarming along with the romance between Tiana and Naveen. The theme of the story is amazing and provides a great message. The music was fantastic and gave off a great New Orleans vibe. The voice acting was on point and the characters were terrific. Not to mention the animation was gorgeous. Overall, it's a lovely movie and will make you smile.",The Princess and the Frog
57,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,A triumphant return to the good old traditional animation,10,5 February 2013,"I became much anticipated when Disney was going to return to the traditional animation form when they released this in theaters back at 2009. I saw it twice in theaters with my family and my brother by ourselves and we loved it as hard-core Disney fans of my favorites (The Lion King, Aladdin, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Mulan, Tarzan, etc). So, are there any flaws in this movie? Well, let's just say that there is one because the end of the movie does get a bit rushed, but it doesn't matter.Everything else is brilliant. The story has the same ""wishing on the star"" concept, but it's entirely different and it does have some funny and heart-rendering moments (the part where Ray dies was so sad). I will admit I did get kind of scared in the ""Friends on the Other Side"" sequence. In fact, the songs from Randy Newman is pretty darn good. Maybe not as memorable as Beauty and the Beast and the others, but it does have some nice lyrics.The characters are great. Tiana is beautiful and a great addition to the other Disney Princesses (Belle, Ariel, Rapunzel, Aurora, Jasmine, Cinderella, Mulan, and Snow White), Prince Naveen is enjoyable with his charismatic appearance, Charlotte La Bouff is so funny and steals almost every scene she's in, and the comic-relief characters Louis, the trumpet playing alligator and Ray, a Cajun firefly help lighten the drama and suspense the movie has (even it's dark moments can easily frighten all of the younger kids). The best character, however, would have to go to Dr. Facilier who is by far my favorite Disney villain. His charismatic and menacing appearance really wowed me at the moment I met him in the beginning of the film thanks to Keith David's excellent vocal performance.The voice acting for the other characters is great with Anika Noni Rose, Bruno Campos, Michael Leon Woody, John Goodman, Oprah Winfrey, Jennifer Cody, and Jim Cummings voicing the likable characters out of sheer excellence. The script isn't the best, but it's not that bad. The best part, however, would have to go to the animation. The look of New Orleans, the Mardi Gras Parade, and the swamp are great; even the character animation is well drawn.Overall, The Princess and the Frog is a classic return to the traditional animation and it's recommended to those who haven't seen it yet. It is that good!",The Princess and the Frog
58,Atreyu_II,"Disney is back, but this is not a return to Disney's good old days",5,21 March 2010,"'The Princess and the Frog' has had much publicity for being Disney's return to its traditional methods of animation. Because of this simple reason, I bet many folks expected great things from this, mostly fans of old Disney. Well, for fans of Disney films from recent years, this might please them. On the other hand, for traditional Disney supporters, very likely this might be not quite what they expect.As for me, this movie generated mixed feelings. It wasn't on my plans to watch this in the theaters. However, I had this unexpected invitation to go to see it, so I did.The artwork is partially comparable to the old classics. At least the sceneries and backgrounds are terrific, although very realistic but at they least they don't suffer from the ugliness of CGI stuff. There are also some very good special effects that create a magical feeling. However, most of the characters (particularly the human characters) are typically CGI and with all of the bad things that has. Plus, many of them are annoying as hell - mostly the Shadow Man and that 197 year-old witch. The only character I liked was Louis the crocodile. He was cool and fun.It's easy to see that this movie isn't completely original. It has a large amount of inspiration in animated films like 'Anastasia' and 'The Swan Princess'. Look at its settings, backgrounds and story and tell me it doesn't resemble these films? Plus, don't some of the human characters resemble 'Anastasia'? Or the frogs and crocodiles that look exactly the same as Jean Bob (the frog) and the crocodiles of 'The Swan Princess'?Oh, and just between us, I thought the frogs would remain frogs forever, since midnight had come and the spell was not broken.This movie has many faults, but one of the worst to ""digest"" is the fact that it is extremely loud and almost painfully noisy. I mean, one thing is some noise during the film. But a 97 min long movie, which about 99% of that time is loud and noisy is too much, so much that I almost couldn't handle it.",The Princess and the Frog
59,johnstonjames,Don't Miss It!,9,16 February 2010,"Classic hand drawn animation is always the best and Disney was the height of the craft. Disney invented the full length animated feature film, and as far as I'm concerned, they've never made a bad one. Recent full length projects like 'Home On The Range', 'Treasure Planet', or 'Atlantis', were not bad films, they were just maligned films by know-it-all movie critics and neo-enthusiasts who claim to love the craft. Those films were treated unfairly and not given a chance. I have never missed a full-length animated Disney feature since I was a child, and I was born in 1961. I always went and saw the new animated films and the classic reissues every time they came out. And it's been that way ever since. Even in the 80's when snobs were dissing great films like 'Cauldron','Mouse Detective','Fox and the Hound' and 'Oliver & Co.', I saw these films and loved them. Disney full length hand animation has always been true to the form and there has not been a single bad one. I'm not talking about the so-so direct to DVD sequels, but the theatrical film events that gave the studio it's reputation.This film is an event. Much more interesting than all the computer art that is so popular and trendy these days. I think it's the best thing the studio has done since 'The Little Mermaid'. Even better than 'Beauty and the Beast' which was nominated for an Oscar for best picture.For anyone that loves a good old fashioned cartoon, and anyone that loves good old fashioned Disney-style entertainment. You can't miss this great, lovable, movie.",The Princess and the Frog
60,ghostfiendghost,enjoyable but lackluster and has little to no impact overall,6,23 January 2019,Now don't get me wrong this film is still quite enjoyable and fun to watch and is plenty fine for children to watch but for me the story/script needed a great deal of work especially for a project like this. Honestly I was captivated on how bad the end was with the Dr. losing it really felt like their was little tension and that he wasn't even given a chance to complete his plan at all. The jokes in this movie didn't really hit me well at all and character wise its alright but the film just had no impact. The songs and animation are still beautiful (as expected of 2-d disney) but overall it wasn't the strongest film to end the reign of 2-d disney films,The Princess and the Frog
61,Igenlode Wordsmith,"Great aesthetic, neat twisty plot",8,13 May 2016,"This was one of the Disney films I meant to see during the BFI's all-year Disney-a-week marathon, but managed to miss out on (my enthusiasm had rather flagged by the end of the year). I watched it today under less-than-ideal conditions, on a salvaged second-hand DVD that jammed and skipped, and without actually being able to concentrate on the screen for considerable periods of time, and I liked it a lot: more than ""Tangled"", more than ""Frozen"". Loved the Twenties aesthetic (little references like Naveen's ukulele), Tiana's realistic working-class parents, the New Orleans setting, the jazz, the voodoo (the Shadow Man has definite overtones of Baron Samedi). I liked the way that Charlotte, though clearly spoilt rotten, turns out to be a good friend and not an antagonist (and they even manage to make the friendship between the Sugar King's daughter and Tiana the black waitress come across as plausible). The Shadow Man makes an excellent villain. And, although this sounds cruel, I liked the fact that they went so far as to really kill off Ray, instead of pulling off the last-minute magical resurrection that seemed to be on the cards -- though any last words at all were a bit implausible under the circumstances!I have a bit of trouble swallowing the idea of talking animals in New Orleans in the 1920s -- mainly the idea that the alligator can actually talk to ordinary people as well as to enchanted ones -- although that's a weird sticking-point given that I had no trouble with the idea that frogs can talk to alligators and fireflies... My main beef with the film would be that Naveen didn't really work for me as a character and I couldn't see what someone like Tiana would see in him; Flynn Rider as a similar 'reformed rogue' was much more interesting from that point of view. Having watched the DVD extras I now gather that he was supposed to be a complement to Tiana's character in that he can appreciate the things of the moment while she is so focused on the future that she misses out on beauty and reality that she's in the middle of -- and that at least one of the jammed/skipped sections was one that apparently made this point :-( However, when I saw the film he came across as rather flat. (And why the French-sounding accent, when he's the one character in New Orleans with no reason to sound French?)I wasn't especially fond of the songs as tunes -- nothing like as memorable as the numbers from ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Corpse Bride"" -- but they work well as spectacle with the accompanying animations. ""Friends on the Other Side"" reminds me a bit of ""Remains of the Day"" in that respect, which is perhaps unsurprising! The film scores highly for me in that it repeatedly took completely unpredictable twists: I couldn't see the plot points coming, and yet they generally made perfect sense in retrospect. This is one picture where 'spoilers' are definitely best avoided, and somehow I'd managed to miss hearing any of them in advance :-)High on the visuals (sorry, but I'm really not that sold on 3D animation), high on the plot, very high on the background and setting. Naveen drags it down a bit, I'm afraid, as I couldn't really get invested in the romance, but overall 8/10. It would bear watching again under better circumstances; I'd have been tempted to hang onto the DVD if it hadn't been damaged!",The Princess and the Frog
62,Carycomic,Disney has themselves another future classic.,10,20 December 2009,"It's loosely based on ""The Frog Prince"" (which I don't think has been ""dramatized"" since the 1970's Muppet version). And, it's set in Jazz-Age New Orleans, where Tiana--a work-aholic only child--seeks to open her own restaurant. Enter Naveen, a fun-loving foreign prince who'd prefer to be a jazz musician. If only his royal parents hadn't cut off his allowance!The two of them would seem to be irreconcilably different. Yet, actually, they balance each other out. And, in the words of wise old Mama Odie, they ""just got a dig a little deeper"" to see it.Unfortunately, a voodoo sorceror named Dr. Facilier, and Naveen's turn-coat butler Lawrence, have other plans. How Naveen and Tiana thwart them is part of the charm of this newest animated epic. The other part is the great jazz music (which Walt Disney, himself, used to be so fond of), plus the nice subtle homages to past Disney classics.The constant wishing on the Evening Star (Ray the Firefly's beloved Evangeline) puts me in mind of the opening number from PINOCCHIO. Charlotte's Mardi Gras gown reminds of the one worn by Cinderella to the Prince's ball. And, the rousing animated sequence set to ""Dig A Little Deeper"" is like a gospel version of ""Kiss The Girl"" from THE LITTLE MERMAID!Add to all that the bonus of Keith David (Goliath from GARGOYLE THE SERIES) once more working with WD Studios, and you have a masterpiece of cinematic gumbo.

64,DonFishies,"Disney returns to its roots, with a vengeance",8,13 December 2009,"When Toy Story was first unleashed on the scene back in 1995 to resounding success, it was the beginning of the end for traditionally hand drawn animated films. They were a dying breed, and as Pixar picked up steam (and inspired countless rivals), Disney began focusing more on the wave of the future and not of the past. But nostalgia is a funny thing, and can help lead to some of the best ideas. And that is where The Princess and the Frog fits in.Instead of using the now traditional method of computer animation, The Princess and the Frog is like a trip right back into the early 1990s. Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) is a hardworking woman living in Jazz-era New Orleans with dreams of owning her own restaurant. She is an inspiring individual, but she lacks the wealth needed to buy and restore any buildings. But a chance encounter with a frog, who claims he is actually visiting Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos), leads to a kiss that makes Tiana a whole lot more amphibian.Although it pales in comparison to the simply magnificent Up, The Princess and the Frog is like a dream come true for anyone who has ever enjoyed Disney films. All the adventure, music and wonder that made classics out of Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid and The Lion King is back and in full form. The trailers predicted the return of a Disney dynasty long thought extinct, and thankfully they were right on the money.While I had some hesitation towards how gimmicky it sounded for the film to finally make a princess out of an African-American, it actually works in the film's favour. Right from the start, we know we have seen predictable animated and live action films that play out exactly the same as this film does. But throwing in this new invention of a different breed of spunky and independent princess, one so closely timed to the election of President Obama, makes the film more original than any of its contemporaries. While Tiana's attitude is a little bothersome at first, it blossoms into something beautifully inspiring for young girls primarily, but for just about anyone who has ever had a dream before. She is every bit as developed as Cinderella, Snow White, Ariel, Belle or any of the other countless ""princesses"" Disney has thrown into the mix since 1937.But while there is a lot of predictability in the script, (even with the clever additions of the likes of a trumpet-playing crocodile aptly named Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley) and a backwoods-speaking firefly named Ray (Jim Cummings)), the film's success rests solely on the visuals on display. Right from the start, we are thrust into this classical looking New Orleans, where even the darkest depths of the bayou seem all the more brightly lit when drawn by Disney animators. There is just such reverence and bravura shown throughout the film that one wonders why hand drawn animation was ditched in the first place. This film only proves how vibrant and imaginative the format can be, and how much easier it lends itself to varying styles. The ""Almost There"" musical sequence near the beginning of the film is done in a style totally unlike anything else in the film, and is so incredibly well done that you may not even notice. But something like this could never be manipulated or maintained anywhere near as wonderfully in a fully computer generated movie. This speaks volumes for how affective this film is, and that is only in one sequence.The voice cast is not filled to the brim with well known stars, but each actor voices their part with so much enthusiasm that you may think they all are. Rose, known likely best for her role in the amazingly well choreographed but fatally flawed Dreamgirls, is a clear standout as Tiana. She breathes life into this amazingly well rounded individual unlike anything I ever imagined. She made the audience smile, laugh and weep with her all at once, and never broke a beat when she did it. Much the same goes for Campos, who gives a fun and energetic voice to the off-the-wall prince. Wooley and Cummings are simply excellent in their roles, instantly bringing back memories of treasured Disney characters. Small roles by John Goodman, Terrence Howard and even Oprah Winfrey are all well done.But this wondrous return to hand drawn animation is not without its problems. The film spends a bit too much time in the middle focusing on Tiana and Naveen, and almost throws away any potential built up for the evil voodoo witch doctor, Dr. Facilier (Keith David). He is a commonly used archetype, but David is just so brilliantly sinister in the role that he practically begs to be shown more than he actually is. His development is stilted, and what easily could have amounted for more pathos and motivation is simply squandered away for more of a love story. It is understandable why it is done, but it is nonetheless disappointing and acts as a bit of a black hole in the story.Another issue of course, is the underlying stereotypical content in the film. It is not horrendously racist and offensive like I originally assumed, but the conventions are still at play here, and are not entirely glossed over in all instances. Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis) comes off as being played a bit too close to racist conventions, as do many jive-talking individuals who give the twins in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen a run for their money.But in the end, The Princess and the Frog is a triumph of animation and imagination. It is an enjoyable ride from start to finish, and just may be the start of something beautiful for Disney. Let's just hope that they see the potential in it too.8/10.",The Princess and the Frog
65,griffolyon12,Charming Disney Animation!,8,13 March 2010,"Disney's latest hand-drawn animated musical, The Princess and the Frog, is a charming film that, while never reaches the dazzling heights of Disney's greats, is still a film well worth your time.The film is a loose interpretation of the classic ""Frog Prince"" fairy tale, where a prince who is turned into a frog, must be kissed by a princess to be turned back into a human, only problem is, our heroine, Tiana, isn't a genuine princess, just dressed like one at a Mardi Gras masquerade ball. The film takes place in what looks to be 1920's New Orleans, and that is where the film gets all of its vibe in terms of its music and its story. The villain being an evil Voodoo Witch Doctor who transformed the prince of a far-off land, Prince Naveen into a frog. Of course, things only get more complicated when Naveen finds Tiana, thinking she is a princess when she's not, and so by kissing her she transforms into a frog too and they must travel the dangerous bayous of Louisiana to try and reverse the evil Witch Doctor's spell.The film is very lively once it finds its rhythm, only problem is, it takes nearly the first 20 minutes to really find that rhythm. The first 20 minutes holds at least one song every five minutes, and these songs just come on sporadically and do not feel organic to the story, which ultimately makes the entire first act of the film feel extremely choppy, jumping from scene-to-scene. As well, the beginning of the film feels as if Disney was trying to pull out all of the stops and prove to you that they still had that magic touch, so they figured that they'd throw as much musical action at you within the very start of the film, and while some of the songs were good, they just ultimately didn't serve the story. Now, when Tiana is transformed into a frog by kissing Naveen, it is then that the film becomes its own.Once frog Tiana and frog Naveen are trying to cross the bayou together, it's here that the film becomes something unlike any other animated Disney musical, while still falling into the canon. Tiana and Naveen grow closer upon their journey, whilst befriending a trumpet playing alligator, Louis, and a Cajun firefly, named Ray. What makes everything from this point on so intriguing is that it is a breath of fresh air for the rest of the film, because no other Disney film has transformed the two main characters, especially a prince into a small animal and have the actual meat and romance occur in those amphibian forms. There are a great many puns, some really fun songs, and an amazing dance between the two frogs across lilypads and through under the water of the swamps.The music by Randy Newman was very pleasing to the ears, but none of it was really all that memorable, though it still served the story well with its jazzy-tones, evoking New Orleans in genuine splendor, and the animation, was typical Disney animation. While it is not as beautifully animated as Sleeping Beauty, it is such a joy to see Disney back in the hand-drawn realm, and I hope this is the first of many more.Ultimately The Princess and the Frog is an enjoyable time at the movies. While the villain wasn't all that memorable (though his shadow minions were wickedly cool) and it kind of felt, especially at the beginning, that Disney was trying too hard to make you like it, the romance was well-told, there was some very entertaining music, and it results in a very charming hand-drawn movie musical from the House of Mouse that while is not their best, is far from their worst.I give Disney's The Princess and the Frog a 8 out of 10!",The Princess and the Frog
66,meydiana-65242,PERFECT CGI,10,4 November 2020,"The Best Animated Disney movie in 20 years!
I remember the first time I watched The Princess and the Frog, I had had absolutely no interest in seeing it (I don't even know if I had a reason). So when my mom rented it from Netflix, I begrudgingly sat by her side and watched it with the lowest expectations. I absolutely loved it.11 years later, it remains my favorite 2D animated Disney movie (just after Beauty and the Beast).The animation is stunningly beautiful (even the end credits are gorgeous), the soundtrack is fantastic, and there are so many wonderful characters it's hard to choose a favorite. The main character, Tiana, is hardworking, ambitious, and intelligent. Yes, part of the story is her falling in love with a man, but that isn't her goal in the movie, and it isn't the point of the story. They story is all about being true to yourself, working hard for what you want and believing in yourself. It's also about realizing what's important in life, and not getting so wrapped up in how you think life should go that you miss out on other great things.I can't say enough good things about this movie.

67,SquigglyCrunch,A Different but Great Disney Movie,9,6 April 2016,"The Princess and the Frog is the animated Disney movie that takes the original story of the princess and the frog and flips it on its head, and it ends up being great. The plot of this movie is, like I said, basically just a flipped version of the princess and the frog, where instead of the frog becoming a prince, the princess becomes a frog, and it follows these two frogs as they try to become human again. It's a humorous twist that I like quite a lot, and it's presented in a way that makes it very fun to watch. The characters are good. You get a good idea of what their motives are, and they aren't far-fetched or unrealistic. This is a Disney movie that takes a somewhat different approach, and it works really well. Otherwise, the characters aren't amazing or anything, but they're good for sure. I love the point of view of this movie. It's taken from the perspective of someone who can watch the real princess, who is the usual main character of these kinds of movies. It was a nice change, and it works really well. The main villain is also pretty great. From his design to his 'friends' to his magic, he's just really cool. The soundtrack is pretty good too. It uses a lot of jazz music, which is well-suited to the time in which the movie takes place, and it's just really pleasant to listen to. I can see myself listening to it in the future. Overall The Princess and the Frog is one of the better Disney movies, not to say other Disney movies aren't good, of course. It's much different than others, and it works really well. In the end I'd certainly recommend this movie to pretty much anyone, particularly people looking for something different than the usual Disney movie.",The Princess and the Frog
68,elicopperman,A Well Known Fairy Tale with a Modern Twist,8,15 December 2019,"10 years ago, Walt Disney Animation Studios released their first hand-drawn film since Home on the Range (released five years prior in 2004) called The Princess & the Frog. In addition to being a resurgence of the studio's long lost staple, it was their first feature to feature a mostly African American cast, as well as being a modern-esque fairy tale set in 1920s New Orleans, Louisiana. While it still didn't do much to bring the art form back, it was still a well received feature for how it took the fairy tale genre and added its own spin to the formula, and rightfully so.The story centers around a hardworking waitress named Tiana, who dreams of owning her own restaurant. After kissing a prince who got turned into a frog by an evil voodoo sorcerer, Tiana becomes a frog as well, and the two must turn back into humans before it's too late. With a premise like that, once can guess how the film is going to turn out, but what makes this otherwise predictable plot engaging are the characters. Tiana is one of Disney's most relatable heroines, as she spends most of her life working tirelessly to make her dreams come true, and yet she still needs to realize that love and fun will get you there even more. On the contrary, Prince Naveen is a highly upbeat partier who must discover his own responsibilities in order to make a better man out of himself. In addition, the side characters range from comical supporters like the jazz obsessed neurotic alligator Louis, the charming and humble firefly Ray, and Tiana's spoiled albeit hysterical friend Lottie, to evil endeavors like the menacing Dr. Facilier, and minor obstacles and guides like the bizarre albeit knowledgable Mama Odie and Tiana's worrisome mother.As for the technical aspects, the legendary modern Disney animators like Mark Henn, Randy Haycock, Bruce W. Smith, Eric Goldberg, Michael Surrey and more really put their A game on putting in the right amount of personality and charisma into their character's performances. Also, the mix of computer effects and experimental colors really add in to the surreal magic elements that help the visuals pop on screen. The choice to add in bright lights during daytime and creepy shadows at night help make this film work well in the progressive city of New Orleans, since the backgrounds are the atmosphere themselves in terms of color. Speaking of New Orleans, no one could have been a better choice to write the songs than Randy Newman, as most of his work displays both a jivin' jazz and smooth country ballad that make one feel like they're in the city of dreams. The only songs that differentiate themselves from said aesthetics are Friends on the Other Side and Ma Belle Evangeline, since one is entreatingly menacing and the latter is a somberly romantic lullaby worth reminiscing to.However, as fun as the film is, I can't help but criticize it in some aspects that it might not have done the best job at executing. Of course, Disney is known for embracing magical fantasy elements in their movies, but this film takes that in a relatively convoluted manner. As deliciously evil as Dr. Facilier is, his overall plan feels underdeveloped to the point where it has some questionable setbacks, and the reasons they give for how Tiana and Naveen can turn back into humans is honestly a little dumb. I think the issue here is that where most Disney films maintain their magic through easy to follow narratives, this film tries to give too much logic into the fantasy to the point of making it far fetched. Also, there is one scene in the film where Tiana and Naveen have to save each other, and while it has some fun visual gags (courtesy of the great Dale Baer), it adds little to the plot and could have been cut out all together. For a fantasy film made by a studio known for accepting the unexpected, it seems to take the fun of it all a little too seriously.Overall, despite some unnecessarily complicated story beats, The Princess & the Frog is still a delightfully enticing Disney flick for its earnest characters, splendid animation, lively songs and timeless themes. One thing that most people associate Disney with is that your dreams can happen by wishing upon a star, but what we all must remember is that the only way to really get anywhere with those aspirations is to work as hard as you can to get there. This film arguably brings that point in more than other Disney flicks, so it's wonderful to hear what uncle Walt stood for in a tale of hardships, voodoo and jazz music.",The Princess and the Frog

All the adventure, music and wonder that made classics out of Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid and The Lion King is back and in full form. The trailers predicted the return of a Disney dynasty long thought extinct, and thankfully they were right on the money.While I had some hesitation towards how gimmicky it sounded for the film to finally make a princess out of an African-American, it actually works in the film's favour. Right from the start, we know we have seen predictable animated and live action films that play out exactly the same as this film does. But throwing in this new invention of a different breed of spunky and independent princess, one so closely timed to the election of President Obama, makes the film more original than any of its contemporaries. While Tiana's attitude is a little bothersome at first, it blossoms into something beautifully inspiring for young girls primarily, but for just about anyone who has ever had a dream before. She is every bit as developed as Cinderella, Snow White, Ariel, Belle or any of the other countless ""princesses"" Disney has thrown into the mix since 1937.But while there is a lot of predictability in the script, (even with the clever additions of the likes of a trumpet-playing crocodile aptly named Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley) and a backwoods-speaking firefly named Ray (Jim Cummings)), the film's success rests solely on the visuals on display. Right from the start, we are thrust into this classical looking New Orleans, where even the darkest depths of the bayou seem all the more brightly lit when drawn by Disney animators. There is just such reverence and bravura shown throughout the film that one wonders why hand drawn animation was ditched in the first place. This film only proves how vibrant and imaginative the format can be, and how much easier it lends itself to varying styles. The ""Almost There"" musical sequence near the beginning of the film is done in a style totally unlike anything else in the film, and is so incredibly well done that you may not even notice. But something like this could never be manipulated or maintained anywhere near as wonderfully in a fully computer generated movie. This speaks volumes for how affective this film is, and that is only in one sequence.The voice cast is not filled to the brim with well known stars, but each actor voices their part with so much enthusiasm that you may think they all are. Rose, known likely best for her role in the amazingly well choreographed but fatally flawed Dreamgirls, is a clear standout as Tiana. She breathes life into this amazingly well rounded individual unlike anything I ever imagined. She made the audience smile, laugh and weep with her all at once, and never broke a beat when she did it. Much the same goes for Campos, who gives a fun and energetic voice to the off-the-wall p",The Princess and the Frog
70,moviemanMA,Back on track,8,26 December 2009,"After the release of Home on the Range in 2004, Disney Animation Studios took a break from traditional animation and decided to go in the direction of Disney's CG partner Pixar. They released three consecutive CG films (without Pixar), Chicken Little, Meet the Robinsons, and Bolt. These were cute films but still didn't have the staying power that Disney films of the past had.Finally, after nearly a decade of miscues and flops comes The Princess and the Frog. It's the best film Disney Animation Studios has produced this decade. What the previous films lacked this one has. There is great music, a wonderful story, and there are finally some characters that are more than just drawings.The film takes place in New Orleans during the glory days of Jazz. We follow Tiana as she struggles to raise money for the restaurant her father wanted to open. By chance Prince Naveen comes to town from a far away land. He becomes ensnared by Dr. Facilier, also called the ""Shadow Man"" for his ties to voodoo. When Prince Naveen becomes the victim of a terrible curse turning him into a frog. When Tiana encounters him at a party thrown for the prince, she kisses him to try and turn him back into a prince, but because she isn't a princess, it has the opposite affect, turning her into a frog as well.The two embark on a journey into the bayou to find someone who could turn them back into humans. Along the way they join ranks with Louis, a trumpet playing, jazz junkie alligator who agrees to go along so he can be turned into a human. The trio becomes a quartet when Ray, a firefly with a lot of he art, shows them the way through the marshy water of the Louisiana bayou.This story has some elements from the traditional story of the same title as well as The Wizard of Oz. It's not as predictable as some Disney films, taking us to places both physical and emotional that were not expected. It's message is wholesome (it's a Disney movie, what would you expect) promoting love, the power or friendship, and that you should be yourself.I was very surprised at how much the animation had actually improved. It still has the same feel but there is something new here. It's not laden with computer enhanced images like some of the other films. It isn't just a moving canvas of beautiful landscapes. The images are detailed, well thought out, and add that extra bit of magic that a Disney animated film needs.Another strength with Disney animated films both hand drawn and CG is the choice of voice acting. They don't go for the big names but the voices that will bring the character to life. There are usually a big stars, Terrence Howard and Oprah lend voices to a few of the minor characters. I was very pleased with the selection of Keith David, who voices Dr. Facilier. His voice is smooth and deep. Much like his character, he lures you in before dropping the boom. He also voiced the cat from Coraline, another great animated film from earlier this year.There is no major downfall to this film. It's nothing that will blow your socks off but it is entertaining. It's nothing compared to The Lion King but as compared to the more recent films like Brother Bear and Treasure Planet, this one soars above them. I hope Disney puts more effort into their next animated film like they did with this one. If they don't go back to their old ways, cinema will lose a part of itself that cannot be replaced",The Princess and the Frog
71,diac228,"Ladies and Gentlemen, the Disney Renaissance has returned.",9,11 December 2009,"Michael Eisner will forever be known as the man that attempted to totally kill Disney animation. After the disastrous efforts of Home on the Range, what was once a staple of the Walt Disney Company was becoming a thing of the past. Traditional animation was dead in Disney, and this was definitely one of the major contributors towards the shift in upper-upper management and his departure. Now with Pixar and John Lasseter on board, Disney pulls absolutely no punches in their return to tradition. There's a new princess, she happens to be black, and they happen to twist a classic story so much that you have literally no clue in which direction the writers were going. The major question is: can Disney revive its Renaissance quality that it experienced in the 90s? Can they ever duplicate such magic again? The answer is a resounding yes. Princess and the Frog is the best traditionally animated flick (from ANY company) since The Emperor's New Groove. Princess Tiana is the most sophisticated and most mature Disney princess since Belle. The villain here is the best since Hades from Hercules. Prince Naveen is the best prince since Prince Eric (and even then, Naveen is one of the better princes out there). The music here is actually some of the best music from any Disney movie past and present. The animation here is the best since The Lion King. Basically, to sum things up, Princess and the Frog is an excellent effort from Disney and a superb return to Renaissance quality that the company sorely missed and needed.The movie focuses on a hard-working waitress (Anika Nosi Rose) that is saving money to open up her own restaurant, which was a dream her father had always been chasing. Her father also taught her that it's not enough to just wish for something, you have to also work to accomplish what you want in life. Tiana lives her life on this lesson, much to the disdain of others. After a few twists and turns (I don't want to spoil the plot too much), she becomes a frog thanks to Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos), whom is a prince that is very different from the norm in terms of personality and even royalty status. Along the way they will meet a wide assortment of characters, ranging from a charismatic magician (Keith David, in an amazing role), a friendly firefly (Jim Cummings), a music-loving alligator (Michael-Leon Wooley), and many others. The movie clocks in at less than 100 minutes, but moves at such a fast pace, you'll get a lot more material than your average hour-and-a-half movie.Let's just put this out there: Disney treated Tiana and her surroundings perfectly and without overdoing any boundaries whatsoever. New Orleans has an incredibly energetic look, and just enhances the themes and plot of the movie. Accompanying the Louisiana flavor is the incredible score of Randy Newman, which uses a wide variety of sounds and genres from the Deep South (and also is mixed in with a little Newman touch).Can we praise the animation one more time? Sure, why not. The movie looks absolutely beautiful, and doesn't rely on just a simple palette of colors. Thanks to technology and an obvious overload of effort, this is one of the most (if not the most) colorful and vibrant-looking Disney animated movies of all-time. Some of the added computer effects only enhance the sophistication of the animation (I rhymed). One final note, the visual humor in Princess and the Frog is very fast-paced, to the style of the severely underrated Emperor's New Groove. You need a watchful eye on certain scenes to catch all the jokes.If there was anyone that was going to save Disney's traditional animation, it would be Ron Clements and John Musker. These two were the most responsible for the Disney Renaissance, directing Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and Hercules. They once again provide a beautiful story, and direct the movie with plenty of flair and energy. The musical sequences fit the pacing of the flick, and while there wasn't an outstanding track like ""Be Our Guest,"" ""Friend Like Me,"" or ""Under the Sea,"" the repertoire of musical numbers overall was quite impressive. A key part to a great animated movie is having a villain just as complex and/or engaging as the heroes; and the ""Shadow Man"" not only has the best musical number, but also has the most flair of any of the supporting characters. Now we can forgive them for directing Treasure Planet.The biggest reason for the successful quality in Princess and the Frog comes from the Pixar touch. Pixar obviously lent a hand here, as this movie contains some of the most sentimental and touching animated footage since the epic heartbreak moment in Lion King when Simba sees Mufasa motionless. While the movie never nails the emotional torture that Up succeeded (then againfew films ever will), Princess and the Frog will make you cry just as easily as it can make you laugh. Don't let that bring you down though, because this movie carries an upbeat tempo throughout the entire run.Bottom Line: If you enjoyed the Disney Renaissance (From Little Mermaid to Tarzan, before the downfall spiral started), then it is up to you to watch this movie. This movie has all the energy, quality, sentimentality, and superb animation of the 90s Disney flicks, and is inches away from Pixar status. Pixar has saved Disney altogether, and Princess and the Frog is hopefully going to save Disney traditional animation, granted it gets the praise and success it truly deserves. Unlike what we have been seeing in the past, Disney did not half-arse this time. Blending the old-school qualities with a new-school outlook on where the status of animation and storytelling is headed, Princess and the Frog is a fun, entertaining, and fulfilling ride from start to finish.",The Princess and the Frog

74,barrys82,Disney already knows how to make traditional animation,8,31 January 2010,"The princess and the frog is the latest movie from the Disney studios. this one retakes the tradition of the traditional animation and at the same time follows the same formula of each Disney movie of the past. Lots of humor, lots of music and songs, talking animals, a girl trying to become a better person, magic and a colorful world. The story is set in the city of New Orleans and tells the story of Tiana, a girl whose wish since she was a little girl is to have her own fancy restaurant, a prince is desperately seeking a wealthy girl to marry when suddenly he receives a voodoo curse that turns him into a frog, the prince thinking that Tiana is a princess, asks her to kiss him to overturn the enchantment and turns herself into a frog as well. The animation is very good just like all Disney movies, the music is also excellent, already a tradition in Disney movies and the cast of voices were quite convincing. As a conclusion, The Princess and the Frog is a classic fairy tale with a twist of modernity or actuality. It is very entertaining and enjoyable.",The Princess and the Frog
75,Jackpollins,Wimpy attempt at trying to bring back classic Disney,3,29 December 2009,"The Princess And The Frog is an honest but ultimately unsatisfying attempt at trying to bring back the older, better Disney. The problem with the film is that it tries to go in so many different directions. It has too many characters, too much plot, and too little entertainment. The film starts with Tiana (voice of Anika Noni Rose of The Starter Wife and The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency as well as Dreamgirls.) Tiana has always wanted to open her own restaurant, especially when her dad dies when she's grown up. The film then goes into Prince Naven (voice of Bruno Campos of E.R., Nip/Tuck, Royal Pains, The D.A., and Leap Years). Prince Naven is cursed by Dr. Facilier (Keith David). By being cursed, Prince Naven gets turned into a frog. By thinking Tiana is a princess, Prince Naven has her kiss him because Naven needs to kiss a princess to turn human again. Realize how all these plots connect, but there's too many plots? Not to mention, there are not one but two wacky sidekicks. They are an alligator who wants to play trumpet but can't because he's an alligator, and a fly who is in this film for who knows why. The film does have some good songs, and some good animation, but overall, kid or not, don't see this movie.",The Princess and the Frog
76,jakethesnake-42007,Great return to classic Disney,7,13 March 2021,Disney's return to hand drawn animation and return to musicals.Let's get to the cons first the songs are mostly forgettable except maybe 2. Yes Disney is back to its musical roots but they could of had better music.The plot itself is good but has some problems it's not big problems but it's a little flat at times. The characters are fun tho at times the alligator gets on your nerves. It's a great Disney film and at the time of its release it's one of the best Disney films in years. Princess and the frog was the start of Disney's comeback animation films it's prob the worst of the comeback films but that doesn't mean it's bad it's still a great Disney film and I would consider it a classic.,The Princess and the Frog
77,eddax,Charming but not very memorable,8,18 February 2010,"On the long list of Disney's animated musicals, this movie isn't up there with the best of them, but it's still a pretty charming movie. It's very much a typical Disney fairytale, with a girl, a prince, a villain, and humorous sidekicks. The voice-over actors are good, though I'm undecided if it's good or bad that the actors' voices aren't distinct enough to be immediately identifiable, not even Oprah's. What made Up all the more special for me was because I recognized Ed Asner's voice rightaway and knew he would be perfection in the role, but I can also understand if they don't want the fame of the actors distracting people from the movie itself. I reckon the main failing of this movie is that none of its tunes are particularly memorable. None of them come to mind now. There's no power ballad a la ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" and not even a crazy catchy ""The Bare Necessities"" (from the Jungle Book), a tune that still pops up in my mind from time to time, even though it's been decades since I've seen the movie.",The Princess and the Frog
78,D_Burke,"A Timeless Story By Disney, & It's About Time",10,13 December 2009,"Being a big movie fan, going to the movies has never lost its child-like thrill for me even though I go a lot more now than when I was a kid. However, I've never been one to search for updates on upcoming films frequently. Sure, I get the ""I want to see that"" feeling during the coming attractions, but I usually don't search for exclusive pictures on sites like ""Ain't It Cool News"", for instance.However, when I heard three years ago about a 2D animated film from Disney that takes place in New Orleans and has a predominantly African-American cast, I couldn't wait to see it and I wanted to hear more about it any chance I could. I knew there was potential to be set up for disappointment, but I also knew this big change for a Disney film was going to be historic no matter what the outcome.""The Princess and the Frog"" is not just historic, but an appealing and enchanting film that kept me mesmerized throughout. There were a lot of skeptics initially. After all, a number of Disney animated films haven't been particularly racially sensitive over the years. ""Song of the South"" has been shelved by the Disney Company almost indefinitely, and the crows from ""Dumbo"" remain an embarrassing scuff on the animation giant's reputation. Fortunately, in more ways than racially sensitive ones, this movie does right what many other Disney animated movies have done wrong.Contrary to the title, Tiana (""Dreamgirl"" Anika Noni Rose) is not a princess, but a hard working woman from a lower class family who has dreams that do not involve marrying a prince. These ambitions are quite contrary to those of her wealthier Southern belle friend Charlotte (Broadway actress Jennifer Cody), and come in the form of ""Almost There"", a song that's sure to get an Oscar nomination. When Tiana does meet a prince, it's not because she wants to. In fact, it's more because of his greedy mistake than anything.Using the template of the classic story ""The Frog Prince"", which nowadays could not be made into a full-length movie because it can be told in about ten minutes, this film takes that story and creates a better one with a fuller dimension. It also doesn't fall into the trap of parodying the story, as what has now become a cliché started by ""Shrek"" and continued less cleverly by future films such as ""Happily N'Ever After"".Instead of the prince being changed into a frog by a sporadic witch, there's the better villain of Dr. Facilier (Keith David), who plays a voodoo Creole Mephistopheles in his promises to have Prince Naveen (Brazilian actor Bruno Campos) ""see only green"". Naveen assumes this to mean an end to his financial problems, while Dr. Facilier has other plans.Naveen, as a frog, kisses Tiana, thinking that she's a princess. Because she's not, not only does he stay a frog, but she turns into one as well. Having this scenario set up, this must be the first Disney cartoon ever to have an unpredictable storyline. It's good, too, because in keeping with Tiana's realistic view of not having dreams be realized solely by wishing upon a star, so do both frogs find that their problems don't require one-step solutions such as visiting a blind voodoo doctor Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis). Sure, they get to her, but she has no magic wand to help solve their problems.The best part about this film is not just the positive African-American characters, but the character of Tiana. Because the Disney Princess line is so popular now, it's about time there be a female lead who doesn't pose as a damsel in distress. The most powerful and effective scene in the movie involves Tiana coming face to face with Dr. Facilier. In an almost ""Last Temptation of Christ""-like plot twist, Dr. Facilier gives Tiana a glimpse of how her dream could be realized if she does what he says. The scene that followed made me want to stand up and cheer for Tiana.Of course, it wouldn't be a Disney film without supporting characters for comic relief. I liked Louis (pronounced Lewis) the trumpet-playing alligator (Michael Leon-Wooley) a lot. Louis was like the Cowardly Lion in the Wizard of Oz, and had a unique character trait that didn't try to be as over the top as the Genie from ""Aladdin"" or a direct impersonation of Louis Armstrong. He wants to be human, but he learns in the end that being himself is he best thing. The Creole firefly Ray (Jim Cummings) seemed to me at first to be an unnecessarily wacky character with a voice like Adam Sandler's Canteen Boy. Eventually, though, Ray became the heart of the movie, especially with his song about his crush Evangeline, who the other characters soon realize is actually a star. An unexpectedly poignant scene near the end made Ray far deeper than a character that sells as a doll.Many moviegoers assumed with 3D animation dominating theaters that 2D animation is dead. Disney films like ""Treasure Planet"" and ""Home on the Range"" didn't negate that theory very well, but in this film, not only is the animation great, but the story is intriguing and unexpected. The characters are strong too, especially Tiana. Anika Noni Rose should be given extra credit for her performance, especially considering her third tier role behind Beyonce and Jennifer Hudson in ""Dreamgirls"" three years ago. Unlike the other two, she's not a household name yet, but she shows here that she can be just as good a lead actress.I had a great time seeing ""The Princess and the Frog"", despite the fact that I felt silly asking for a ticket to see a film with the word ""Princess"" in it. It doesn't matter, though. It's a great film, a perfect welcome home for 2D animation, and I give it the highest of recommendations.",The Princess and the Frog
79,Stompgal_87,A worthwhile and stunning modern classic from Disney,9,12 July 2013,"I have wanted to see this film ever since it came out and one of my former classmates from university recommended this as well.Prior to seeing this film, I saw a few clips of it on YouTube (in the Nostalgia Chick's Top 10 Disney Deaths and in a young boy's countdown of the 10 saddest Disney moments). It was definitely worth watching because it had a diverse range of lead characters and side characters, the usual Disney fairytale formula with a modern twist and catchy jazzy, soulful and swing-inspired songs, especially 'Down in New Orleans,' 'Almost There', 'When We're Human', 'Ma Belle Evangeline' and 'Dig a Little Deeper.' 'Friends on the Other Side' was worth a listen as well as the end-credits song by Ne-Yo. The songs genuinely made the film's pace swift. The animation is fluid and detailed and there is an interesting variety of backgrounds. Although the animation style changed during 'Almost There,' it had a warm colour scheme nonetheless. Princess Tiana went down in history as the first ever black Disney Princess and she is a charming protagonist who was cute as a child and aspiring as an adult. Charlotte (AKA Lottie) is an excitable supporting character whether a child or an adult while Louis (who I once mistook for the crocodile in 'Peter Pan' when my classmate drew a picture of him) and Ray are comedic additions to the cast of characters. Dr Facilier was a dark villain who was as original as his death, although I thought his death could have been shown before Ray's (Facilier stepped on Ray to begin with) since it would have made more sense. This film also has product placement (Tabasco sauce), which is very rare in Disney animation (with the exception of 'Toy Story' where toy manufacturers are mentioned). One of the most beautiful scenes was the one with Prince Naveen and Tiana (as frogs) dancing whilst being surrounded by floating water lilies - very pretty. I initially thought this film was Disney's take on 'The Frog Prince,' but it is in fact based on a story called 'The Frog Princess,' although I was happy to see 'The Frog Prince' featured at the beginning when Tiana's mother read it to the very young Tiana and Charlotte. There was also some humorous dialogue involved, especially the hop-related puns.Overall, this is a stunning entry in the Disney Classics canon that bridged the gap between 'Bolt' and 'Tangled,' which are also very good in spite of their CGI animation making them easy to mistake for Pixar films, and this was the best 2D animated Disney film from the 2000s since 'Lilo and Stitch.' 9/10.",The Princess and the Frog

The froggy relationship doesn't show an iota of the depth that made ""Beauty and the Beast"" a true classic.Still, more than watchable and maybe a small step towards a third golden age of Disney animation.6 out of 10 slimy, no, eh, mucous kisses",The Princess and the Frog

The first black Disney princess is a frog for most of the movie. However, this is not obvious. The first black Disney princess is not a princess, but a very poor young lady working at a restaurant in New Orleans in the early 1920s saving up another money to open a restaurant. Tiana's father died in World War I before he could fulfill his dream of opening a restaurant. The ugly firefly died. These topics were too serious for a children's animation. Also, the prince was cut off by his parents. And his servant had low self esteem and was tricked by the man who performed voodoo. This movie had a happy ending like all other Disney Animations.

While the animation seems almost old fashioned compared to most of Disney's recent films it is almost reassuring to see a good story told in beautifully coloured 2D.The story is of the ambitious New Orleans waitress who hopes to fulfill her father's dream of opening her own restaurant. Needless to say things don't run smoothly after she meets a visiting Prince out for a good time. After an epic journey through the swamps (after both of them have been turned into frogs) things turn out fine in the end. I don't think I'm giving much away there! Randy Newman has some great songs, especially the Oscar nominated ""Almost There"". The voice-acting is excellent. Jennifer Cody and Jennifer Lewis are particularly good in supporting roles. Relative unknowns Anika Noni Rose and Bruno Campos are excellent in the main roles.There are some touching and some funny moments. Most definitely one for all the family!",The Princess and the Frog
84,FairlyAnonymous,An animated movie that really captures a classic mood.,8,27 June 2011,"The princess and the frog has been either praised by some, or condemned by others as not being a good Disney movie. I personally liked the movie and loved the fact that it was animated. I miss animated movies greatly, and this movie seemed really good because it was animated.The characters in this movie are fairly good, while some of them are fairly generic. Ray was considered annoying by some, but honestly I don't think he was that bad. The main characters are both good, and you can see how they evolve, but they aren't the most complex Disney characters out there. What really makes this movie stand out more than most Disney movies is its villain. I have to say you will never see a cooler Disney villain out there. Dr. Facilier has style, he has a great musical number (it is a really good one), and he has evil spirits on his side which are very cool since they move through shadows. His song is very catchy, but dark, and his demise in this movie is probably one of the darkest deaths of any Disney villain.Dr. Facilier in my opinion basically made this movie good. The main characters were fine and all, but Dr. Facilier is a man who wants spirits to eat everyone's souls. That is pretty dark, but as mentioned before it is really cool. Without him this movie would've been OK, but nothing too special.So while The Princess and The Frog is a good movie, it relies a little to heavily on an interesting villain than on an interesting cast of main characters. There are some funny scenes in this movie, and one moment almost felt like a Family Guy moment. Either way good movie.",The Princess and the Frog
85,kevinxirau,A good throwback to the classic Disney era.,7,21 October 2011,"I miss the good old days of Disney. It was a time when some of the most memorable animated characters graced the big screen and have since left such a big impression to this very day with an unmatched charm. With more animated films now in days being all CG, this movie came around and brought back the traditional and glorious hand-drawn animation back into theaters.The playboy Prince Naveen arrives to New Orleans while hardworking waitress Tiana is on the verge of getting herself the restaurant her father dreamed about. When Naveen is transformed into a frog by the sinister voodoo master The Shadow Man (Keith David), he wounds up getting Tiana to kiss him to reverse the spell only to turn her into a frog too. With the help of the trumpet-playing alligator Louis and Cajun firefly Ray, Tiana and Naveen set out to break the spell while finding the missing part of their hearts.Right from the start, old memories come back together. Lively characters, catchy songs, fluid animation, and the old Disney charm. While giving nice little ""winks"" of previous Disney flicks like Aladdin and Hercules, it gives its own class of style. Every character has his/her unique personality and liveliness and one of the best characters is the Shadow Man. It's great that Keith David, who has done an awesome performance as Goliath from the Disney Gargoyles series, comes back to bring this great villain to life and his song ""Friends on the Other Side"" is really fun to watch.It's nice that Disney is still sticking to the old ways and I'm kinda interested in what they plan on doing next with this style of animation. Check this movie out and let old memories settle in. Just don't go kissing any frogs...or fireflies...or alligators.",The Princess and the Frog
86,Avwillfan89,It hit like the child in me,10,10 February 2010,"It's been a long time since I've seen a film like this. At first I had doubts about the film, considering that animated musicals have been clichéd for decades and that 2d animation movies no longer clicked. But this film proved everyone wrong. It has all the magic, humor, dramatic scenes and good story-telling of the classic Disney animated features. Disney heading back to its roots with a whole new different kind of story, but in its old traditions really made me feel like a child again. It's a story loosely based on the Frog Prince by the Brothers Grimm, but it works perfectly. The princess in the movie, Tiana is not a princess at first, she's a waitress saving up her money to open up a restaurant. The prince, Naveen, is actually a poor guy whose rich parents leave him to fend for himself. When he encounters the local witch doctor, he turns him into a frog. Naveen then visits Tiana to convince her to kiss him in order to break the spell. When she reluctantly agrees and kisses him, though, she herself is then transformed into a frog. Both of them then decide to search through the local bayou, along the way meeting a trumpet-playing alligator Louis (named after Louis Armstrong), a Cajun firefly Ray (named after Ray Charles) and blind old voodoo witch, Mama Odie, in order to transform themselves back into humans.Even though it's a kids film, I felt it had a few (mostly positive) adult themes to it, such as poverty and working hard to get dreams to come true. Tiana has worked two jobs her whole life so she can open her own restaurant and Mama Odie tells her to ""dig a little deeper"" to find out what she needs and not what she wants. The fact that it's Disney's first African- American princess and is set in the Jazz Age, turns this traditionally hand-drawn animation into a breakthrough in a new age of Disney Renaissance. Disney did it once again: It was right on target!",The Princess and the Frog
87,RichardSRussell-1,"A Nicely Done Princess-Formula Film, Certainly NOT the Top Movie of the Year",7,16 December 2009,"The Princess and the Frog (1:37, G) — Fantasy: Fairy Tales, 2nd string, formula, OSIT romanticsI'm filing this not under ""talking animals"" (despite their occupying 3/4 of the screen time) but under ""fairy tales"", since it so obviously wants to be one — and largely succeeds.In a bid to return to the glory days of 2-D cel animation, Walt Disney Studios has released yet another princess film, complete with admirable dead parent, colorful villain, pransome hince, obligingly helpful woodland critters (well, wetland critters in this case), wishable stars, gay songs, dark interludes, and tiaras aplenty. It is a marketer's dream, and spin-off merchandise is even now appearing on toy-store shelves and in fast-food restaurants everywhere. This particular flick stars the State of Louisiana, with special guest appearances by the iconic bottle from Avery Island.Oh, yeah, and of course it's got a plucky heroine, too. Wouldn't be a princess film without one. This time around it's Tiana (voiced by Anika Noni Rose), and her destined beloved is Prince Naveen of Maldonia (Bruno Campos). Of course, since he starts out as a jazz-loving Simba-like wastrel, disinherited by his royal parents, while she's an exhausted waitress double-shifting to save up for her own Cajun restaurant, they don't exactly hit it off right away. Anyone want to lay a bet on how it turns out? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?Naveen and his overworked, under-appreciated valet Lawrence (Peter Bartlett) need a get- rich-quick scheme, and local voodoo practitioner Dr. Facilier (Keith David), he of the semi- autonomous shadow, thinks that the ideal approach is to seduce local belle Charlotte, dotter of fabulously wealthy ""Big Daddy"" LaBouff and childhood friend of Tiana. ""Seduce"" isn't exactly the appropriate term for this kid-safe, G-rated flick, of course, but that's what they're up to. Of course, since they're dealing with ""friends on the other side"", the trolley runs off the tracks. Lawrence is transformed into a Naveen lookalike, while Naveen becomes a bullfrog.It is in this guise that he approaches Tiana with the old song and dance about how kissing him will turn him back into his princely form, but again there's gum in the works, and the transformation goes in the opposite direction, with Tiana becoming a lady frog. The rest of the film is spent with the 2 of them journeying into the bayou in search of a cure. Gradually they warm up to each other. Tiana introduces Naveen to the 1st thing resembling work he's ever seen in his life (mincing mushrooms for a gumbo), and he in turn gets her to overcome her protestations that she's got 2 left feet, now webbed, with the observation ""If I can mince, you can dance."" Advice for the ages, my friends!Natch, all the problems are resolved in the end, using satisfyingly imaginative approaches (screenplay by Rob Edwards and co-directors Ron Clements and John Musker, adapting The Frog Princess by E. B. Baker).The voodoo sequences were splendidly artful. Harlan Ellison has often remarked that animation is the natural medium for fantasy, and that was certainly true here, with memorable black-light and flyatcha effects (tho they were on screen only long enuf to whet the appetite). And the scene that gives new meaning to the word ""tongue-tied"" probably couldn't have been done except via animation.The music, including original songs by Randy Newman, occasionally added to the sense of place and atmosphere but usually was nothing remarkable. There may be a special shelf somewhere in Hollywood on which you'll find The Sound of Music, Jesus Christ Superstar, and The Little Mermaid — the pantheon of movies with wall-to-wall great, hummable, whistleable, singable tunes. The 1st 2 of those, of course, were adaptations of stage performances (and a possible 4th addition to this hall of fame, Fantasia, was a case where the movie was written to the music, not the other way around). Suffice it to say that this is no Little Mermaid. But give credit where it's due: At least it HAS songs. Have you looked recently at the vast wasteland that is the Academy Award list of Best Song nominees? Several years ago, apparently out of embarrassment, they dropped the number of nominees from 5 to 3, and they're still having trouble filling the ticket with anything worthy of the name.While this was an enjoyable movie, even for adults, I am mystified that Time named it the top film of the year. I can only call this a triumph of good will over good judgment. Yes, as pretty much everyone in America knows by now, the heroes are either black or some other ethnic minority; yes, it's nice that Disney Studios finally overcame old Walt's bigotry; yes, New Orleans still needs all the good vibes it can get after Katrina. But #1? Really? Better than every other movie in 2009? Sorry, guys, not buying it. Worth seeing, but not even in my Top 10 SF&F pix, let alone Top 10 in general.",The Princess and the Frog

The Princess and the Frog is an enchanting throwback to the second golden age of Disney (beginning with The Little Mermaid in 1989). In fact, it feels almost out of place for this film to have been released in 2009, instead of the early 90s.A solid plot, characters you come to care for, a superb jazz score (my favorite song being 'I've got friends on the other side' and endearingly quirky sidekicks - everything is very well put together indeed.

Just one song - Evangeline - stands out. Every time they broke into singing I was rolling my eyes. The colors are excellent but that is about all that was excellent.

91,colinrgeorge,"""The Princess and the Frog""",8,6 April 2010,"Directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, the masterminds behind two of the best Disney cartoons of the early nineties (""Aladdin"" for the boys, and ""The Little Mermaid"" for the girls-- though to be fair, I love both), ""The Princess and the Frog"" is a film that bleeds nostalgia, and resonates with me for the same reason ""Enchanted"" did two years prior; this stuff is ingrained on my childhood. As a tyke at West Coast Video, if anyone even remembers those, parental requests for my film selection would invariably come back, 'Lady and the Tramp,' though with a more toothless diction. ""Aladdin"" and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" are a couple of the first movies I remember seeing in theaters. And I know I'm not alone in having had to fast forward through the parts in ""The Little Mermaid"" that featured the terrifying octopus, Ursula. ""The Princess and the Frog"" is not a revelatory piece of visual storytelling, but it so nearly mirrors the style, presentation, and ebullient energy of the classics that I couldn't help but fall in love. The music by Randy Newman, which encompasses a diverse range of New Orleans flavor, is catchy and the song sequences are inventive enough to rarely feel shoehorned into this modern family film. The magic is there, and more often than not it just feels right.The hand-drawn animation is equally stunning, though occasionally suffers from overuse of an ugly computer-shading technique, and jazz age New Orleans springs to life via chugging steamships, sparkling cityscapes, murky bayous, and the brilliant costumes and colors of Mardi Gras. The Big Easy sets the stage for a twist on the classic 'Frog Prince' fable, which not only posits that a kiss from a princess will return a frog to his formal royal glory, but that a kiss from anyone but will spread the amphibious curse. Inasmuch, the majority of the film, and the love story between our protagonist Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) and the handsome prince Naveen (Bruno Campos), takes places between two frogs. The premise sounds anything but compelling, but the sequences prove too charming and clever to feel like a generic animated animal film.The film has been the target of PC debate since Disney released the first concept sketches featuring its heroine, auspiciously the corporation's first black princess, a while back. The trailer also incited allegations of racism for its loose allocation of black stereotypes in certain characters, most obviously the lightning bug, 'Ray,' who's voiced by Jim Cummings, a white man. These claims are understandable based solely on the promotional material, but the film in earnest depicts its cast as immensely likable. In the same way any of the above films have poked fun at Middle-Eastern or European stereotypes, ""The Princess and the Frog"" is never guilty of more than gentle jest towards African Americans.In revisiting these films from my childhood, I've developed an infatuation with the catalogue of Disney villains, including, reluctantly, Urusla. From ""Sleeping Beauty's"" Maleficent to ""Aladdin's"" Jafar, it's these characters that I can still unashamedly call 'cool,' and ""The Princess and the Frog"" has a great one. Enter Dr. Facilier (Keith David), also known as the Shadow Man, a voodoo witch doctor who consorts with his 'friends on the other side' to turn Naveen's slimy disposition into handy profit. David is brilliant as the dark doctor, whose scenes are smattered with popping purples and greens, and of whom my only request is, 'more, please.'""The Princess and the Frog"" tells a timeless story in style, and stands a gorgeously well- meaning and engrossing audience-pleaser that all but the most calloused cynics should enjoy. I suppose those who have either outgrown or never enjoyed the canon of classic Disney animated films will find few redeeming qualities here, but for the rest of us, ""The Princess and the Frog"" is a blast from the past complete with the warm and fuzzy feelings of Disney at its most magical. Enjoy.",The Princess and the Frog
92,BoydudeReviews,"A fantasti story, with great characters and animation.",8,17 November 2018,"I have to admit that, at the time of the film's release, that this film wss the best disney film since Lilo and Stitch.

I love the anination amd backgrounds. Rewatching ot now, it is still great, just not as amazing as when I last saw it. But yea, I love the main character, Tina and all the other characters. All enjoyable to watch. The songs arn't bad either. Prettt damm enjoyable. I do 100% recommend this film. I loves how they made the princess black, which wss a firsr for disney and sadly, it was thw last major 2D animates feature by Walt Disneg animation, as they have now opted out to CGI films. I do believe that 2D will return in disney ans I hope it comes back, better than ever. 😁👍🏾",The Princess and the Frog
93,The_Orenda,Disney comes back.,9,21 December 2009,"As the 2000s exit, we can look back at CGI animation with mixed feelings. Pixar has always scored with their movies, but Disney, Dreamworks and 20th Century Fox has had their hits and misses in CGI, enough so that Lasseter has done the right thing, resurrecting the House of Mouse by bringing back traditional animation. The Princess and the Frog screams of ambition and effort. Plot, action and character are crammed firmly tight into 90 minutes of wall-to-wall animation, with the dancing, movement and Broadway scores tuned right up to 11 to create an excellent feature.One problem with 2D animation is the generational gap. I firmly enjoyed the film but the kids around me under the age of 10 did not. One of the kids, who is 9, took out his Nintendo DS during the movie. ""It's boring, I don't want to watch it."" I think the hardest, yet boldest, move on Disney's part was setting the movie in the bayou. They stuck to their guns, and it's possible they invested for the long haul in Princess Tiana. Right now, in a time of Christmas, Avatar, and a whole generation of crummy 2D animated films (Home on the Range? Anyone?), that preceded this wonder, Princess and the Frog had a very big uphill slope to climb. A success critically yet underwhelming domestically, Disney has to go back to the drawing board and dig deep, now that they've dusted off their papers, pencils and ink. Which is a shame, simply because Princess and the Frog really is a smart and fun movie.What makes Princess and the Frog great? It's largely due to character. Prince Naveen is far removed from any other prince in Disney's world. He's a layabout,  and it results in his family dilemma. He's flawed but he knows the difference between right and wrong. He's charismatic, yet it works to his disadvantage. Then there's Tiana herself, a Princess unafraid to run herself into the ground, so to speak. The Shadowman, Dr. Facilier, our main antagonist, is something or other. These characters, and everyone else for that matter, are exceptionally important to why this movie is so great. It's about the story, and Princess and the Frog has made a decent effort at providing a contemporary take on old themes. I look forward to what Disney has in store.",The Princess and the Frog
94,wwe7961,Welcome back Disney we really missed ya!,9,24 October 2010,"""Disney"" is a name that fills people with the happiness of childhood. Scratch that. They used to fill us with happiness. In the early days we met Micky, Minny, Goofy, Donald, Snow White, Pinocchio, and many other characters. Then a time came that ""Disney"" started losing its status. Then in the the late 1980's Disney started a come back resulting in Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Lion King, Huchback, Mulan, and more in just a decade. ""Disney had once again become a symbol of excellence in animation again. Unfortunately the next decade would be that of corruption. In the 2000's ""Disney"" didn't release many 2-D animated films. I loved ""Lilo and Stich"", and ""Emporer's New Groove"" was very funny, but other than that the 2000's had very little to offer from ""Disney"". Instead of releasing great 2-D animated films they relied on several things to keep the company alive.1.Disney World-Of course2.The Disney Channel/Awful Music Stars-Extremely unfunny shows, awful singers, and terrible shows about the singers.3.""Pixar""-An extremely creative company that does all the work on their masterpieces. Then ""Disney"" comes along to take the movie to theaters, stamps its name on it, and takes part of the profit.They went from makers of such classics to sell-outs. The only time I would feel happy to see something ""Disney"" related would be either classics from the good days or something from ""Pixar"". Now I am happy to say that there are some people left at ""Disney"" with enough passion in their heart to stop being lazy, and make another movie to be called classic. Here it is, and while it doesn't make up completely for how they have betrayed us it still is a deep breath a fresh air helping those poisoned lungs. First thing to say is that I love the setting of story. It was about time they added a bit of chocolate to the cracker if you know what I'm saying. The setting of New Orleans in the Deppression Era is filled with life. This brings me to the music which is very diverse for ""Disney"". The farthest I have seen Disney go into different forms of music in their musicals is reggae in ""The Little Mermaid"" . Here we have jazz, ragtime, and country which is something that ""Disney"" musicals has't gotten into. As for the song themselves they are wonderful. The two I would like to pick out are ""Almost There"" and ""Freinds on the Other Side"". ""Almost There"" is an excellent song showing the feelings of a person in the Deppression who feels like their almost at their dreams. The animation in the song sequence is wonderful, and it looks like the cover a jazz album coming to life. Then we have my favorite. ""Friend on the Other Side"" is a brilliant villain song that is one of the best of the decade. I love how charismatic, and cool it is. The animation in the sequence is gorgeous, and filled with strange images. That leads me to the absolute best part about this thing. The Shadowman. I absolutely adore everything about the character. His image, his charisma, his song, his voice actor. He is awesome, and in my opinion one of the best ""Disney"" villains. Is this film perfect? No. One of the things I didn't like was how cliché it was. ""Disney"" wanted to make it give the audience the same kind of feel to it that the classics had, but I think I have seen a midnight time limit a bit to many times. Also I felt the romance was too sporadic. It's like one second they hate each other, and the next the ""Disney"" love train is on the way. Personally I liked the scenes where they were arguing or just having some witty comebacks at each other more than the romantic stuff. Overall though it is a breath of fresh air, and now that Miley is gone I think this the start of a new era for ""Disney"". A good era.3 and a 1/2 stars out of 4",The Princess and the Frog

Under repeated pressure from my younger sister to see The Princess and the Frog with her, however, I eventually caved. And how glad I now am that I did.Disney's first traditional animation in six years, The Princess and the Frog takes us to New Orleans in the days of Jazz. Tiana is a hardworking waitress, saving everything she can to fund her dream of opening the restaurant her late father always wanted. When a Prince arrives and is set to marry her wealthy best friend, she is keen to avoid the regal theatrics, until she is caught up in an evil ploy and finds herself, along with the polar opposite Prince, green and ribbiting.Bearing many of the hallmarks of Disney classics, the film brought me rushing back to my childhood, the musical numbers and faceted wit reminiscent of all things animated which I grew up with. The story is expectedly simple and straightforward, a funny twist on a well-known tale. Bearing a genuine feel, The Princess and the Frog slots neatly alongside its predecessors, feeling instantly as though it was made at the same time as them. The characters are fittingly weird and wonderful, and slot perfectly into the Disney vaults alongside all the veterans of days gone by; Louis the Alligator and Ray the Firefly among the best of the supporting character duos in the studio's history. The film had me laughing the whole way through, far more interested and involved than my younger counterpart. A particular element of the film's conclusion did much to embed it in my memory, the beauty of its implementation both surprising me and ensuring my love for this wonderful cartoon.Funny, fun and nostalgic, The Princess and the Frog marks Disney's triumphant return to the glory days of real animation.

With hard work, you can live your dreams. Good message. I liked the New Orleans in the 20's and Disney didn't fall back on modern slang to make it hip to kids, but used phrases like ""bee's knees"" etc. I liked the jazz music and the songs, though not as strong as the Disney I knew as a kid, think Jungle Book and Aristocats, was OK enough. I liked the idea of a bad voodoo guy and a good hoodoo blind lady...and all the animal characters weren't annoying. I enjoyed this film a lot and would recommend it to people who like Disney, the 20's, New Orleans, hoodoo or a combination of the above.

The animation, as far out of place it would seem in 2009's whimsy of variety in animated films, is quite beautiful in plenty of spots. The story is a fun parody of the Grimm tale successor The Frog Princess set in New Orleans, which is pretty swag for an original concept. The characters and acting are all top-notch and are animated pristinely so that their movements seem natural yet still appealing. It does have some times when the humor isn't strong, some scenes get dull, and personally I didn't take Ray's death that hard. Besides that, this film is nothing less than one you must consider seeing, whether you have the home video or the necessary TV channels it occasionally airs on. I don't need to mention the songs because like any Disney musical, they try very hard and it just pays off.

100,Angels_Review,A Interesting twist of a old classic,7,2 June 2014,"For anyone who knows me, they could tell you that I love twisted fairy tales and messed up concepts. This one is a twisted tale of The Frog Princess. We have New Orleans around a time when it was at its finest or at least what I would call its finest. When the jazz was hot and good soul food filled the streets. Because of a witch doctors spell, a prince is turned into a frog and then ends up turning our main character into the same. Well, it's like a bad version of Beauty and the Beast meets Cinderella a bit. I don't get what makes princes so desired to be turned into animals and beasts but it sure happens a lot. What makes this show a bit more fun is that our main character wasn't even supposed to be turned into a frog. The witch doctor didn't have a thing against her; she didn't have an evil step mother to hate her, just a simple girl trying to make it in the world. How she changes is just the case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.The artwork is just what you would expect from Disney, pretty good and rather colorful. It was also surprisingly dark for a children's show. The imagery got really dark compared to other shows (Well, except for Snow White). I have to say the shadow man is right up there with Queen Grimhilde, aka The Evil Queen. There were also parts of the artwork that reminded me a lot of The Swan Princess. Just how bright the rest of the show was and some of the artwork with the water.The voices are what you would expect for something based in New Orleans. It's very stereotypical but I'm not against that at all. In fact, it gave the show all the charm it needed to step it out of being just a stereotypical Disney flick. We don't have our normal white damsel in distress but a strong black woman who is independent and her voice carries that strong feeling right down to how she sings. It's the prince that seems more like the helpless one. The prince voice did get a little annoying at some points. Just the French accent that they forced to him made it a little hard to understand some of what he said though they did a good job holding it back enough.",The Princess and the Frog
101,valen060,Film Review: Traditional Animation BACK with A Vengeance!,10,11 January 2010,"AT LAST! The long-awaited return of the animation that really jump-started Disney back in its early years. WAY before computer animation and motion capture, I grew up watching an abundance of Walt Disney's animated films (I was born in '86 by the way) of the 1930s and on into the 1990s, but this film proved that hand-drawn animation is still alive and kicking! I'm not saying I detest computer animation in any way, I'm saying that it couldn't hurt for Disney to return to its former glory that is hand-drawn!As for the film itself, it was clever and well-written! The plot, the characters, the music, voice cast, as well as the time and setting, they all blend in really well together! These were the elements of the glorious days of what the Disney Renaissance era was like throughout the 1990s. Aside from the fact this introduces the first black Disney princess, the lead character Tiana seems to be a blend of a few past Disney princesses. It's like Tiana has Ariel's aspirational personality, Belle's virtuous demeanor, and Jasmine's idealism. Her voice actor, Anika Noni Rose, nailed it. When she starred in the 2006 film, ""Dreamgirls"" with Beyonce and Jennifer Hudson, she didn't have as much screen time as her co-stars, but in this film, it was her time to shine! The villain of the film, Dr. Facilier (voiced by an impressive Keith David) had quite a personality. He wasn't one of those dark and ""pure evil"" types like a few known past Disney villains, he had his wits and wisecracks to blend along with it (much like what James Woods did when he voiced Hades of ""Hercules""). It got me thinking that Facilier might be a descendant of Jafar (of ""Aladdin""), due to his knack in dark magic. Anyway, he has officially become one of my personal favorite Disney villains (just like it was for Jafar, Scar, Frollo, Hades, etc).Overall, the Disney animators have really outdone themselves with this movie. I'd say that computer animation deserves to take a break for a while and that people shouldn't forget the original roots of what really started animation! Hand-drawn has made its return into the spotlight! Audiences won't be disappointed with this spectacle! It made me feel nostalgic of what the previous Disney animated films did for me in the 1990s and this film is NO EXCEPTION. I have seen this movie more than three times in a row at my local theater and it never gets old! ""The Princess and the Frog"" will definitely be on my ""must-own DVD"" list!",The Princess and the Frog
102,sngbrd39,Back on the right track?,8,2 January 2010,"Could it be? Is Disney back to releasing...quality films?? Much like Disney's most famous previous outings, The Princess and the Frog is a fairy tale of sorts. On a visit to New Orleans, Prince Naveen is transformed into a frog by Dr. Facilier, the Shadow Man, a practitioner of voodoo. Meanwhile, an ambitious young lady named Tiana works endless shifts as a waitress to fulfill the lifelong ambition shared by her and her late father: to open a glorious restaurant that will be the talk of New Orleans. These very different individuals cross paths at a pre-Mardi Gras masquerade; life will never be the same for them again.I fully, thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Of the ones I've seen in the past decade, this is definitely the best Disney movie to come out in a long time. Of course, I was a girl who grew up on the Disney musicals like Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid, so it was refreshing to see them return to that format. In so many ways, this movie had a lot going for it.Visually, The Princess and the Frog is very stunning. I have never been to New Orleans personally, but I can say that it looks gorgeous in this film. I also liked the use of different artistic styles throughout the film, such as the art deco of Tiana's fantasy sequence and the near-psychedelia in the Shadow Man's voodoo ceremony. Although the characters definitely had the ""Disney look"" about them, it was very cool to see some branching out into different directions.The vocal cast of this movie was excellent as well. Anika Noni Rose has a powerful, emotional voice that brought life to the character of Tiana, and Bruno Campos performed the part of the prince with charm and humor, something that doesn't always seem to be apparent in Disney princes. Both of these characters seemed to be real people with foibles and flaws, and I think the voice acting went a long way toward giving them dimensionality. Keith David provided an appropriately menacing performance for Dr. Facilier. Especially, though, I appreciated the supporting cast. They added humor and support to the story without going too over-the-top or becoming annoying, a problem in many latter-day Disney films.The music of this film was greatly appropriate, highlighting the many musical traditions of the American South, from jazz to zydeco. While I liked Randy Newman's songs and score, I don't think it was quite up to the level of many previous Disney efforts. I didn't walk out of the theater humming any of the specific songs. All the same, though, I would willingly listen to the soundtrack if I had the opportunity to do so.With The Princess and the Frog, I believe that Disney is getting back on track. I'm hopeful that we will see great things from them again in the next few years!",The Princess and the Frog
103,GuyCC,It Takes A Princess....,10,13 December 2009,"Every Disney ""revolution"" starts with a princess.""Snow White"" began the Disney animated film series. ""Sleeping Beauty"" brought the series to the 70mm format. ""Little Mermaid"" revitalized the modern day format as things were growing stagnant past Disney's death, and ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Aladdin"" perfected the ""animated Broadway"" style of the films.For five years now, we've done without traditional 2D animation. Disney went CG to try to self-compete with Pixar, which in an honest opinion, Disney should have left things to the masters, and just remained true to their own gifts. ""The Princess and the Frog"" returns Disney back to its former self.The film isn't a direct retelling of ""The Frog Prince"". It just takes the theme and runs with it, opting to tell its own interpretation. Set in 1920's New Orleans, this is a genuine and grand celebration of a beautiful, mysterious and magical city set in its prime before politics and natural disasters hurt its image and people. This is a reminder of how wonderful the city has been, and what still remains. The color, the architecture, and especially the music, ring true.Tiana is a ""working girl"" (waitress) long before she ever becomes a princess. She has a dream, and nothing is going to get in her way of achieving her goals. Her childhood friend is spoiled and boy-crazy, but is a genuine nice surprise by proving that she's not a total superficial and shallow character, and actually has a heart. Of course there are distinctions and acknowledgements in class (it IS the 1920's, after all), but they are merely presented as being what was without being focused on, and in a story like this, it shouldn't be. This isn't a political piece. It's a fairy tale.Tiana herself is charming, funny, independent, and of course, has a wonderful singing voice. And when the mysterious ""shadow man"" sets his voodoo in action for all of the main characters, the ""adventure"" aspect begins.Of course, Prince Naveen and Tiana, while being two completely different people, find ways to work with each other, accompanied by a jazz-playing alligator (which this character reminded me more of Walt's era and style than most have of late), and a Cajun firefly who actually had some depth and soul to him, not merely being the annoying comedic sidekick.And of course, being a Disney film, there are big musical numbers. With ""Tarzan"" in 1999, they took a break from the standard musical format, and bring it back here with lavish spectacle not unlike ""The Lion King"", ""Aladdin"", or ""Beauty and the Beast"".The film works on a lot of levels, the biggest being a genuine ""return to form"", when Disney released critically acclaimed film after film in the 1990's. Disney seemed to have genuine intent to return to the ""glory days"", and in that respect, I think they have succeeded (in no small part due to Pixar's John Lasseter taking over Disney's animation - thank you, John).But it also hearkens back to Walt's fun time with the bright colors and characters, and the scary moments and yes, even the sad, ""real"" moments.*spoiler*One of the main characters dies, and it's handled in a serious, but touching manner**end spoiler*I've read some comments on review sites that the first ""black princess"" is downplayed by having her be a different form for a large part of the film. If you know anything about Disney films, this is not a new concept. Films like ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Mulan"", and ""The Emperor's New Groove"" all had their protagonists change into something else until they could look deeper inside themselves and figure themselves out. Tiana, while a good character, isn't ""perfect"", and misses some important aspects of being a full person. And it's in this time of being out of her element that she figures out what it is, as does Naveen.Of course, being a fairy tale, one should expect the ""Happily Ever After"" ending. And it's a fun, uplifting ride, and going into something like this, I think people want that.""The Princess and the Frog"" is a long-overdue return from Disney, and something that they shouldn't deviate from again (i.e. - forsaking traditional, hand-drawn 2D animation). The characters are lively and fun with good development and depth, the music is accurate for the setting, it has a real, thought-out story, and the visuals are colorful, detailed and spectacular. The best way to describe seeing the film is like revisiting a friend that you haven't seen around in a long time.The film is worth the wait, and definitely a highlight in a sea of bland ""family"" films. I think in some ways, this is also a fairy tale for Disney studios itself, as they seem to have taken a look inside as well, and were reminded by what makes them special and unique.",The Princess and the Frog
104,chloebetts,Love this,8,3 August 2021,I don't think this princess movie gets enough recognition. The songs are really good and also love the relationships.,The Princess and the Frog
105,moonmonday,"Disappointing, but not for the reasons most allege",3,14 December 2010,"I finally saw this film, a year after its release, knowing more or less entirely what happened. It was disappointing, but not for the reasons most people here and elsewhere seem to propose.Skin colour was an often-cited issue, but this was mainly by people looking for a problem. By being turned into frogs, they showed that love is when you look past a person's external appearances...skin colour included! People making a big fuss about imaginary race issues was what turned people off this film, with its mediocrity, the result of numerous revisions to try and please those who likely never intended to see it anyway.For all the people saying voudou didn't belong in a Disney film...have you seen any Disney films? Most of them have an antagonist who abuses magic of some kind, opposed by a supporting character who helps the hero(ine) and also uses magic. It's the classic good witch/bad witch dichotomy as presented in iconic works such as The Wizard of Oz. Voudou, as in the film, has an underlying theme of responsibility: you don't get something for nothing, and you're responsible for what you do. The film's presentation of voudou isn't expected to be pinpoint-accurate; it's a fanciful one. Voudou is as intrinsic to New Orleans as jazz and above-ground cemeteries. Children are well aware that their parents' beliefs are not the only ones in the world. If you can't handle other beliefs, don't see movies!The setting was appropriately magical, and as someone who spent time in New Orleans, I can say it really did capture some of the magic and wonder of that place. The spirit was there, and the thought was nice. It's one of the few places on Earth where a fairy tale story could be believably told.The characters, in concept, are great, but in realisation they are much weaker. The story, similarly, is one that is a strong premise, but unfortunately it is also one that doesn't hold up well. Disney clearly catered too much to the critics of their classic princess stories, but the problem is that their statements are usually inaccurate and based on misremembered cliché. A common mistake is that all prior princesses were useless and did nothing but wait! The other princesses were hardworking, and the message was always to work hard and keep hope, and your strength of character and inner beauty will one day bring true love. They overcompensate by making Tiana a workaholic. Race isn't really an issue, despite it being long before the day of equal rights; money, however, is the issue that runs strong through the film.Tiana's friend Charlotte is infinitely more likable, which makes the film profoundly sad because she is never allowed to have even the smallest triumph, despite being the one who believes and hopes and is genuinely a good person. Tiana is just a huge wet blanket, and despite being advised by Mother Odie -- a great character with a 'classic' feel to her -- she never seems to change that much. She's hard to sympathise with and hard to like, because she's not a fun person and her dream doesn't meet with identifiable dramatic hardship like Snow White's (murder attempts), or Cinderella's (basically slavery). We don't even get to see who outbids her for the restaurant and creates the only immediate motivation.Naveen was lovable, but he wasn't a full character. This is a weakness since they were clearly trying to 'real it up' in light of the inaccurate criticisms. Prince Charming has elan. Prince Philip was a major part of his movie. The Beast was another good prince portrayal. Naveen is cute, but his situation doesn't compel.His assistant has little reason to turn to evil, and we don't get to know him enough to sympathise with or revile him. Shadow Man isn't given enough to do and barely interacts with the heroine until the very end. Ray is cute but serves no purpose except to make audiences believe Shadow Man is actually evil, rather than just bland, which is something that the narrative should have done long before.The songs are not really memorable, though nice. The visuals are nothing amazing, and to have made such a fuss over a 'return to hand-drawn animation', it had too many CG traits.It was also disturbing to me that Naveen and Tiana had their big moment in the middle of a romantic song sung for someone else. Get your own song! Far be it from me to criticise whirlwind romances, but I just didn't believe that Tiana and Naveen were meant to be, or that they were even that into each other.Who was that man Tiana's mother was seen with twice at the end? So she finds love immediately, and yet Charlotte gets a throwaway joke? It's not funny, it's cruel and sad. And somehow, simultaneously too much and not enough of this film was left on the cutting room floor.It should have been shorter, the characters should have been much stronger and more compelling, and the music should have been more memorable. Tiana needed a worse situation and a more sympathetic personality; no child is going to identify with a workaholic, even one with a deeply-held dream. And it's just not right that someone who doesn't even believe in fairy tales and only barely believes in wishes coming true -- out of desperation -- is the one who is regarded as the 'princess' and gets what she wants, without having to change much of anything about herself.In fact, I think ironically, this film in many ways embodies everything the critics complained inaccurately about classic princess films having. And to me, that's why it is so disappointing. It tries to please the people who don't like the kind of story it is, and in so doing it ends up forgetting the audience who loves them.",The Princess and the Frog
106,ikrani,"Fun, Colorful, but...",8,10 February 2014,"I didn't see this movie in theaters. The last Disney movie I saw when this came out was Brother Bear and, as some of you will agree, that movie was pretty bland. And I was still recovering from the onslaught of direct-to-video sequels that Disney had been spewing out under Michael Eisner's money-grubbing leadership.But, I kept hearing such good things about it and so decided to buy it on DVD. And, after watching it, here's my verdict: It was good. Not great, not ""meh"", just good. The animation is detailed and colorful, and the way the characters were designed made me think of Aladdin or The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The characters were all fun to watch, with the exception of Charlotte, who I found INSUFFERABLY annoying.The songs were... Eh, short and bland. I was warned ahead of time that the two best songs were at the beginning, and unfortunately my source was right. Most of the songs in this movie are short and bland, with the exception of ""Almost There"", the visuals of which gave me a Jeeves and Wooster vibe, and ""Friends on the Other Side"", which everyone agrees is an awesome villain song.The villain, voiced by Goliath from ""Gargoyles"", was pretty cool, even though people whine about how ""Voodoo's not magic, it's a religion."" To those people, I say this: the Catholic Church isn't an organization that advocates the genocide of minorities (I hope), Pocahontas didn't fall in love with John Smith, the Little Mermaid died at the end of the REAL story, Cinderella's step-sisters didn't see her wedding (if you know what I'm talking about), genies never made dated pop cultural references, and lions don't sound like Jeremy Irons OR James Earl Jones. What are you gonna do?That's my other problem with this movie. There isn't enough of the villain in it and we really only see him do two villainous deeds: turn the prince into a frog (like you couldn't have guessed that from how subtle the trailers made it) and a bit of murder. But he really needed to be in more of the movie. I liked Dr. Facilier; he was a cool and somewhat sympathetic villain. But unlike Darth Vader or Ratigan (Disney's greatest villain), he was seriously under-used.But, those two peeves are just my preference. Overall, it was an enjoyable, funny, and sometimes dark movie, especially when the villain gets his just desserts. GOD, that scene was scary...",The Princess and the Frog
107,MetalAngel,Disney's back...with an excellent film!,9,15 February 2010,"Disney's back...and I couldn't be happier to inform you of it! From John Musker and Ron Clements, the directors behind ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""The Lion King"" and ""Hercules"" comes the first 2D animated Disney film in five years, ""The Princess and the Frog"", a landmark that signals the rebirth of hand-drawn animation and an involving storyline, which is something that recent Disney films have been missing. After the closure of the hand-drawn animation branch of the Disney studios in 2005 (due to the commercial and critical flop ""Home on the Range""), we've seen a slew of silly and useless Disney films that ascertained the fact that Disney was steadily losing its reputation as the king of animated films. Not only are they poorly animated (in comparison to, say, Pixar films) but they also lack a story and interesting characters both children and adults can identify with. Now ""The Princess and the Frog"" comes to redeem Disney with fabulous old-school animation, perfect music and a nice story we can all sit back and enjoy.The film follows Tiana (voiced by Anika Noni Rose), an African-American girl who lives with her mother and father in pre-war New Orleans, when jazz was only being born. Her parents struggle for money and her father dreams with opening a restaurant where they can sell their tasty food, including Tiana's amazing gumbo. But the years pass, her father dies, and Tiana- now a grown woman handling two jobs- fends for herself and tries very hard to earn enough money to fulfill her father's needs. While this happens, Prince Naveen from Maldonia (Bruno Campos) visits New Orleans; he's a fun-loving, music-playing playboy who's been cut off from his family's money and has come to America to seek out a rich prospect to marry. Deceived by an evil voodoo man, Dr. Facilier (Keith David), he's transformed into a frog to keep him from meeting a wealthy socialite who's throwing him a party one night.Tiana's at that party, serving some of her famous pastries, and the frog prince mistakes her for a true princess because of the dress she's wearing. He convinces her that he'll turn back into a human if she kisses him, and in exchange he'll pay for the restaurant she so dearly wishes for. But when they kiss, Tiana turns into a frog and now they must seek out a good-hearted voodoo witch who lives in a bayou to change them back to their human forms. Along the way, they meet a hilarious cast of animal characters and learn important life lessons, among them how money isn't what matters most in life, how dreams come true, how love can sustain you and how you must work hard and be yourself to triumph in this world.This is a wonderful story, indeed, featuring a lovely twist on the original fairytale. It is also culturally accurate in every sense of the word; the setting of New Orleans during the birth of the jazz age, the design of the houses and the costumes people wear, the lovely bayou of the West, the dialogue and accents of the characters...everything down to the jazzy score and triumphant songs make this an important and thoroughly enjoyable movie experience.The film began and I just stared in awe during the first few minutes, unable to believe how Disney could have come back to us with such a powerful movie. My sister was laughing whole-heartedly enjoying it, and I laughed along with her at the innocent fun and slapstick, at the intelligent story, and I marveled at the flawless and beautiful animation. I had seriously lost my hopes at being entertained so much by Disney ever again, but this film lifted my hopes and made me believe once more in true love and happily ever after.I mean, it's NOT ""Beauty and the Beast"" per se, but it's a great movie. The music is perfect, even if it's not as awesome or as mind-blowing as Alan Menken's previous work, but Randy Newman took the material he was given and made wonders with it. His score seems shy and unimpressive but his songs are pitch-perfect and you'll feel like dancing along with them. And there's a wide array of characters which you'll fall in love with, and various truly hilarious scenes you'll cherish and find yourself smiling at long after the film's ended.I'm glad Disney's returning, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next. This may not be the BEST animated film of the year, but it might just be one of the most enjoyable and charming movie experiences you'll have any time soon. I highly recommend it!

109,zactac,2D animation has a triumphant return with The Princess and the Frog.,10,17 March 2010,"It has been at least ten years since a truly wonderful 2D animated movie has come out. Just like how The Little Mermaid brought 2D animation back when it was almost dead, The Princess and the Frog does the same thing. The Little Mermaid began the Disney Renaissance era (which ended with Tarzan) and it seems it begins again with The Princess and the Frog.Just like Disney has done with other classic fairy-tales they have re-worked The Princess and the Frog into a different kind of story. The story is set in jazz-era New Orleans where we meet Tiana a girl who dreams of owning her own first class restaurant but with constant criticism and even some racism from almost everyone around her it looks like her dream won't come true. But then Prince Naveen comes into the picture. He is some what spoiled, a ladies man, and has no desire to settle down any time soon. He meets the Shadow Man a witch doctor who just wants one thing... money. After turning the prince into a frog he replaces him with a duplicate so he can get his hands on the money of the wealthiest man in New Orleans. After he assumes Tiana is a princess he gets her to kiss him so he could turn back to normal, however it all goes wrong. Since Tiana isn't really a princess instead of turning him back it turns her into a frog herself. So now they must journey through the swamps of Louisiana and find the one person who can turn them back to normal and show them that maybe everything they thought they wanted may not necessarily be what they need.This movie takes everyone who watches it back to the classics that have redefined animation. It has unforgettable music, lovable characters, and great animation which shines and sparkles just like some of the best 2D animation has done in the past. Highly recommended to people of all ages. Disney has brought 2D animation back and better than ever before.",The Princess and the Frog
110,bblack1-699-968577,Disney Reminds Us that Hand-Drawn Animation is Not Dead,9,19 June 2014,"I have to admit, I wasn't really excited about ""The Princess and the Frog"" when it was released in theaters. Not just because I was in high school, but also because I didn't like most of the productions (live action movies and TV shows) Disney was creating at the time. However, I finally saw it a few years later and I was blown away by it! I am in love with this film! For the Clements/Musker team to accomplish this, that's incredible! This is my second favorite Disney film after ""The Lion King!""ANIMATION: Do I even have to talk about the animation in this movie? It's fan-frickin-tastic! This is the animation people wanted to see from Disney in years, and it certainly does not disappoint! Look at the bright colors and great visuals during the ""When We're Human"" song; look at the water throughout the film; pay attention to the lighting - it's just great! It's so beautiful and rich; Disney reminds us that hand-drawn animation is not dead. Who would want it to be dead after seeing this movie? I hope Disney keeps making traditionally animated movies, it cannot be a forgotten, forsaken art!SONGS/MUSIC: I really wish the songs in this movie were much more appreciated; I think they're incredible!...Well, most of them. I hate ""Gonna Take You There,"" which I just found out is not called ""Going Down the Bayou."" The characters were already traveling down the bayou, and now they're singing about going down the bayou?! It's annoying! I don't really care for the ""Down in New Orleans"" number at the beginning of the movie, but at least it sets us up in the location of the movie. It's OK...But I do love the reprise of that song. I like ""When We're Human"" and ""Dig a Little Deeper."" Ne-Yo's ""Never Knew I Needed"" is a great sum up of the romance in movie. ""Almost There"" allows us to delve into Tiana's psyche. But, of course, my favorite is ""Friends on the Other Side!"" That may be one of my favorite Disney villain songs! It continues the story, we see how evil the Shadow Man is, and the music is so intense, you feel the weight of Shadow Man's plan. It's great!ROMANCE: The romance between Tiana and Naveen is really beautiful to watch. I like watching them get to know each other and work together; I like watching them fall in love. This is very reminiscent of the Disney romance we saw in ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin;"" of course we know two people can't truly fall in love in 3 days, but you believe how they fall in love and you just can't get over how beautiful their relationship is. It's great!CHARACTERS: Let me say it now and get it over with, I don't like Ray. He is incredibly annoying! His voice is annoying (no disrespect, Jim Cummings), his character is annoying, his dialogue is annoying, his jokes are out of place and unfunny - I just don't like him. Now that I got that out the way, I love everybody else! Tiana is a fantastic lead character; she's my favorite Disney princess! She's smart, she's quick to think, she's a hard worker, she's kind - she's everything you'd want to see in a female lead character - a lead character period. She's the greatest lead since Belle in ""Beauty and the Beast!"" Naveen is also a lot of fun. I like that even though he's a party animal, he's not stupid. He's still smart and clever. Charlotte is hilarious - I love her! Her character, her attitude, her behavior - she's great! My favorite character, hands down, is the Shadow Man, voiced by Keith David! (God bless you, Keith David!) My gosh, I love him! The animation on him is quick and lively, he is the coolest Disney character I know, and he is so deliciously evil! Do you hear how he talks to Tiana as he tempts her to give him the talisman? He sounds like the Devil! In my opinion, he's the best Disney villain ever!STORY: The story is definitely creative, but I think it's way too detailed. As a result of that, there are tons of moments a lot of people would call loopholes. For example, Shadow Man tells Naveen he just wants to be free and hop around, thus turning him into a frog; but since Tiana kisses him and she's not a princess, she turns into a frog herself...OK. But Tiana and Naveen will turn human if Charlotte kisses them on a specific night before midnight because she's technically considered a princess...OK. In the end, Tiana and Naveen get married and become human because by having Naveen, the prince, kiss Tiana, that makes her a princess, thus the spell is broken...Confused yet? That's the main problem with the movie. The story isn't bad, it's just way too complicated.CONCLUSION: Despite it's complicated story and annoying firefly, this movie is fantastic! I love it! I hear people say that this movie is underrated; while I don't think it's necessarily underrated, I do wish it were more popular. I was upset, but not surprised, that ""Tangled"" became more popular and successful than this movie. I do think this film will be looked at as one of the great Disney classics. In fact, I think this film apologizes for the racist crows in ""Dumbo"" and the possible racist primates in ""The Jungle Book."" In any case, the film was loved when it was released, it's loved now, and we can only hope it'll grow in popularity in the future. Take a look and see what you think. God bless you.

111,Scarefish,"""I kissed a frog, and I liked it.""",9,13 December 2018,"Disney has had its times when they could do no wrong, and then long bouts of doing nothing but sub-par drivel, and it's fluctuated throughout their history. I definitely prefer the 2D age of Disney, so this film is a standout among a bunch of 3D animated features around the same time period. Though many 3D features are of excellent and even superior quality, such as WALL-E and The Incredibles, there's a certain charm to 2D animation that 3D could never match.The Princess and the Frog provides new material with much of the heart of the classics and a story and art direction that excels with a diverse cast rather than being complacent just with a diverse cast and phoning the rest in. Unlike many recent attempts in film, this one does not pander and comes off rather naturally as it does not treat its characters differently from those in the all-white Disney films from the past.The animation is beautiful and smooth whilst being simplistic and somewhat minimalist, making this film stand out as more beautiful than prior 2D Disney films. It's treading familiar ground, but the execution is as clean as it's ever been. The only animated film which I felt more visually interested in was Don Bluth's The Secret of NIMH due to that film's creative perspective shots and bizarrely realistic movements. The main characters are designed very well, especially the frogs who are very expressive, cute, and creatively animated. Though they look nothing like their human forms, the frogs lend themselves well to their respective actors. Side characters are hit-or-miss, with the alligator being borderline generic, and Ray, the firefly, being an absolute eyesore and potentially the most hideous sidekick in a Disney film. The color palette is very pleasant, with lots of cool blues and greens and shows restraint in use of strong colors, which is unfortunately rare as many family films opt for very obnoxious colors to grab the attention of young children for merchandising purposes. These traits allow it to stand out and feel unique and different whilst remaining familiar to those who watch Disney classics.As characters go, Naveen is the main highlight. Bruno Campos' mix of French and Brazilian for the accent worked perfectly in providing a charismatic voice for the character, and he and Tiana make an odd but interesting couple. I didn't particularly care for Tiana early on in the film. Though I get why her character is grossed out by frogs, having her crushing the hero with a book works just the once as a surprising gag. Soon after, she then threatens him once more as he cowers helplessly, which seems a tad too mean-spirited. Once she also becomes a frog, the movie really picks up as the two leads play off each other very nicely, like a bickering married couple. The alligator is sort of unimportant to the plot and just acts as a comedic buddy character, which is a tad unnecessary as the frogs handle comedy just fine on their own. The firebug character is essentially to this film what Mater is to Cars, being an obnoxious bottom-of-the-barrel character to appeal to the youngest of children. I almost wonder if they made him intentionally bad so they could get away with killing him off in the way they did without people feeling too upset about it. The villain is decent, though he certainly isn't half as amazing as Bruce W. Smith described him. Captain Hook and Cruella de Vil are both vastly more interesting villains.I wish Disney would go back to making 2D features, though at this point they seem more interested in re-making everything in supposed live-action, which is really just photo-realistic CGI, so not really live-action at this point anyways. I prefer a simple 2D film that uses wit and expression to push its medium to its potential rather than dull realistic renditions of previously vibrant features like The Jungle Book, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King. While 3D animated features are fine and are certainly better than the live-action remakes, I prefer 2D animation in general as it's just ever-so much more expressive and it's more relatable from the standpoint of a 2D artist. Nowadays, Disney's back in a slump with lackluster Star Wars releases and mediocre sequels marking a lack of creativity from them as of late.",The Princess and the Frog

113,nekosensei,Fable of a happier era,10,22 October 2017,"I wish I'd seen this sumptuous film in the theater, but the reviews made it sound so bad that I ignored my curiosity upuntil now. And not only did I enjoy it on a level I never found in a Disney film up until now, I found myself in tears all the way through the last half hour or so. Was I really that captivated by the plight of Ray the firefly or Tiana the would-be restaurateur turned amphibian? I think my connection with this film goes deeper than that.I remember the time when this film came out. New Orleans was in recovery from Hurricane Katrina, so setting this film in a time where the city could be shown in all its full cultural glamor was a more emotionally intelligent idea than Disney has been given credit for. Tiana the gifted Creole bent on success through hard work is clearly Barack Obama, our prince who won his palace on the Potomac just as Tiana finally got hers on the Mississippi.The world of Tiana is as rich in Americana as it is in gorgeous visuals. All the tropes of New Orleans flash by in a procession, beignets, zydeco, Louis Armstrong, Dr. John, hoodoo, Mardi Gras beads, along with a crowd of flash references from Cab Calloway to Tim Burton. What it all is is a metaphor for a democratic, meritocratic, multicultural America that's finally done with racism once and for all.The New Orleans of ""Princess and the Frog"" ia a metaphor for the Obama era, aplace where everything gets better and everybody gets along. Foreign elements enter easily and mingle with the locals. The whole bayou food chain gets together to travel towards a common goal. Insects and angels unite. European and African American set aside their differences and settle down to becoming family. Everybody who's good gets what they want and the greedy and ruthless get put away where they ought to be.Look where we are now. That's why this movie makes me cry.",The Princess and the Frog
114,ravsten428,Perhaps the best 2D film that came out in some time. We will never see it again.,7,31 May 2012,While Princess and the Frog may not be a classic Disney film by any stretch it is still a delight.Disney decided to go with a 2D animated film and this one is good.The story is about a girl with dreams and also knows that making your dreams come true requires working hard in life. She wants to be able to make enough money to have her own restaurant someday. Also we have a story about a prince who happens to be very spoiled. Mix in the villain Dr. Facilier and you get a recipe for some adventure.Prince Naveen and his so called friend Lawrence are visiting New Orleans when they run into The Shadown Man. Not knowing what they are getting into they will end up making a deal with the devil in exchange for fame and fortune. Lawrence takes the form of Prince Naveen and Naveen gets turned into a frog. Naveen finds Tianna and thinks she is a princess and asks for a kiss to be turned back into a human. Unfortunately for Naveen he hasn't changed back but Tianna herself transforms into a frog as well. Many more exciting things happen in the film and naturally Tianna and Naveen will fall for each other.Princess and the Frog offers wonderful characters both good and bad. Facilier may be one of the best Disney villains ever. He is certainly more convincing then Scar ever could have been. The protagonists of course are just as good and I love Louis and Ray. Ray being my favorite character in the film. I admit the waterworks came when he died. Mama Odie and her snake JuJu were good also.Princess and the Frog is a great movie for all audiences. The only thing I did not care for was when Tianna's mother asked her when she was going to marry because she was wanting grandchildren. This remark I found rather offensive for this day and age especially in a cartoon. Other than that the movie gets my approval. Not a classic but still a good watch.,The Princess and the Frog
115,StartingAllOver14,"It was about time, Disney, give us some more hand-drawn animation!",7,20 December 2009,"""The Princess and the Frog"", Disney's highly anticipated animated feature, is something rare as a hand-drawn motion picture, which is unusual nowadays. If you've turned back time five or six years ago, this would have been a normal event, but after 2D animation was declared dead in 2004 and Hollywood Companies began to milk CGI films, it has been rarely made hand-drawn movies (with the exception of the animated sections of Disney's ""Enchanted""). These five years of absence of 2D has given the audience (included myself) the space to miss and yearn for a new 2D feature from Disney. During these years, I've rediscovered Disney and started to enjoy their animated features again. And it was about time they released a new hand-drawn one. The crew of this film, including John Lasseter, has claimed in interviews that they've gone back to the roots of Disney (the Princess fairy tales) and made a hand-drawn Disney movie with heart and soul equal to the ""classics"". So the question is, does ""The Princess and the Frog"" live up to them? The answer is yes. ""The Princess and the Frog"" is, more or less, just like watching a Disney flick from the 90's and it's great. However, there have been comments about that some of the artwork and character designs are reminiscent of a Don Bluth flick, which is somehow true, especially in the sections on the Bayou (and remember, Don Bluth used to work for Disney once). But fortunately this film feels more like Disney than Don Bluth.The animation, with the exception of some bad drawn townspeople, is wonderful. It's not up to Disney's very best, but it's still lush, colorful and detailed. When it comes to the characters, the lovebirds Tiana and (especially) Naveen are likable and witty, but Dr. Facilier is undoubtedly the one who steals the show. It has become a clichè to declare the villain as the best character of a Disney film, but Facilier really is the most memorable of the cast. Both charming and cruel at the same time, he's certainly the best male Disney villain since Hades from ""Hercules"". After seeing some previews, I got the impression that the secondary characters (Charlotte, Louis, Ray and Mama Odie) were way over the top. Fortunately, they are less annoying in the movie (and I actually liked Ray's firefly family). While they're still goofy and far from Disney's best characters, they have a good interaction throughout the movie, which is nice to see. Especially the love progression of Tiana and Naveen is well done. This film is directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, which has made good Disney movies in the past. You know what you can expect from them, also script-wise, which does have resemblances to ""The Little Mermaid"". Fortunately, the script is tight and doesn't have many story-holes. It is certainly a new and fresh take on ""The Frog Prince"" tale. And for the music; There has been lot of whining about Randy Newman doing the songs and score. I shall confess that I was concerned myself, but the songs are absolutely catchy. Not as the same league as Alan Menken's work, but still good. And his score is alright as well.If there's anything to complain in ""The Princess and the Frog"", from subjective standards, it must be that I personally felt there were some parts between the climax and the ending who could have been done differently or better. If so, this could have been a 8 or 9-stars movie in my point of view.Otherwise, ""The Princess and the Frog"" is a good Disney film. I don't dare to call it a Disney classic, but it certainly one of Disney's finest work, actually and deserves to be at the same league as the films from the early 90's. This film will certainly make up for Disney's recent mistakes like ""High School Musical"", ""Hannah Montana The Movie"" (seriously, the creators could just left the show alone and not milking the product for all it's worth) and their milking of their teen stars. And one thing is for certain; I want more hand-drawn animation from Disney! And soon, please!",The Princess and the Frog
116,Damfino1895,Disappointing,4,27 January 2010,"When I found out I was going to be in Walt Disney World when this was released I was thrilled as I was looking forward to seeing this. Being at WDW in the run up meant I was bombarded with the movie constantly with merchandising and watching the parade that went through Liberty Square and onto the Riverboat, which I might say was lovely.So I went into the second screening on opening day at Downtown Disney really looking forward to seeing it. Sadly I was not so enamoured by the time I came out, it simply did not do it for me. I might add I am a Disney nut, but, it had no magic to it, which was a shame. I felt that there was a laziness about it relying on the fact it was the first Black 'Princess' to sell it rather than a well told story. There was a sequence with a bunch of rednecks in a boat, it really added nothing to the story except to act as a filler to pad out the movie's time. Ray has to be one of the most irritating character Disney has ever produced and his demise at the end did not move me slightly, that may not mean a lot, but, everyone who knows me knows I blub at the silliest of things, I bawl when everyone bows down to Mulan or when the Beast turns into the Prince again and Up set me off every time I see it.John Lasseter is a very talented man, but, I feel he is a bit of a big head, Cars was a vanity project and he was banging on about Prep and Landing being a Christmas Classic before it was even broadcast. He forced out one of Disneys best talents in Chris Sanders and rehashed Sanders' American Dog as Bolt. He produced this film and let me tell you, it ain't no classic. If they insist on going back to traditional 2D, which I adore, then look back at the classics and then do start the work. I'll stick to Sleeping Beauty, Lion King and Lilo and Stitch thank you.",The Princess and the Frog
117,LittleLotti,The Best Animated Disney movie in 20 years!,10,6 April 2020,"I remember the first time I watched The Princess and the Frog, I had had absolutely no interest in seeing it (I don't even know if I had a reason). So when my mom rented it from Netflix, I begrudgingly sat by her side and watched it with the lowest expectations. I absolutely loved it.11 years later, it remains my favorite 2D animated Disney movie (just after Beauty and the Beast).The animation is stunningly beautiful (even the end credits are gorgeous), the soundtrack is fantastic, and there are so many wonderful characters it's hard to choose a favorite. The main character, Tiana, is hardworking, ambitious, and intelligent. Yes, part of the story is her falling in love with a man, but that isn't her goal in the movie, and it isn't the point of the story. They story is all about being true to yourself, working hard for what you want and believing in yourself. It's also about realizing what's important in life, and not getting so wrapped up in how you think life should go that you miss out on other great things.I can't say enough good things about this movie. It's one that I recommend to anyone who's never seen it. I'm 28 years old and still own a Louis stuffed animal that I bought after my first viewing. I've probably seen this 15 times and it never gets old.",The Princess and the Frog
118,Foux_du_Fafa,Splendid from start to finish,8,16 February 2010,"Set in a sugar-coated vision of 1920s Louisiana, ""The Princess and the Frog"" is Disney's twist on the classic Brothers Grimm fairy-tale about a prince under an amphibious curse and his search for a princess to break the spell. Transformed into a frog by the wicked voodoo magician Dr Facilier, Prince Naveen of Moldonia hops over to a hard-working African-American waitress and would-be restaurateur, whom he believes is actually a princess, since she's at a costume party and dressed like one. However, since she's not a princess, she also finds herself as a green croaker after she gives the frog a kiss to try and make him human. Thus, the pair set off from merry New Orleans into the wayward bayous in search of a legendary voodoo priestess and fairy-godmother figure named Mama Odie, who could have the cure to the unusual predicament.""The Princess and the Frog"" is the first full feature film in Disney's revival of hand-drawn animation against the now standard computer-animated norm and has been promoted as being potentially a classic up there with ""Snow White"", ""Pinocchio"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"". It has so far been nothing more than a modest success, which is a tragedy, especially when a piece of trash aimed at people with an IQ the same number as a shoe-size like ""Alvin and the Chipmunks 2"" can do twice as well at the box office (""Enchanted"" in 2007, although more successful, also faced a similar predicament against the first of the chipmunk films). It could have been tired and silly, but it truly works very well and is easily one of the best Disney animated films since the days of ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"", being probably around the same level as ""Lilo and Stitch"" and ""Mulan"". It does revel in tradition and makes a conscious attempt to produce a ""Disney classic"", yet it does not appear stale whatsoever. There are hardly any moments of boredom and the two leads are well developed and likable and their chemistry is sweet and sincere. Seeing the beautifully organic and fluid hand-drawn animation and the gorgeous colourful backgrounds illuminated on a big screen was truly wonderful. Randy Newman's score is lively and it has some absolutely winning songs (in particular ""Almost There"" and ""Down in New Orleans"" - both deservedly nominated for Oscars and worthy of becoming beloved Disney songs along the lines of ""Be Our Guest"", ""A Spoonful of Sugar"" and ""A Whole New World"").In short, ""The Princess and the Frog"" is a delightful film and truly worthy of going to see. Even though it is only three months old and hasn't been a Pixar-level success, it is most certainly in the top half of the studio's animated films; don't tell anyone, but it's more fun than the past few Pixar releases.",The Princess and the Frog

She works two jobs and has realistic goals and dreams. She sings songs with lyrics like, ""The only way to get what you want in this world is through hard work."" And, ""I worked hard for everything I got and that's the way it's supposed to be. If you do your best each and everyday good things are sure to come your way.""The Princess and the Frog is just a cartoon but the characters are strongly developed. They all have defined personalities, which is impressive.

I couldn't wait for the characters to stop singing.Though I was not a fan of the songs, I did love this movie. It was adorable and a refreshing change from the typical Disney movies. Everyone made a big deal that the princess is black and the movie takes place in New Orleans. I like the diversity and feel this will open us up to more diverse characters in the future. I also greatly appreciated the positive messages throughout the movie.

121,YourFamilyExpert,Points for African-American princess; otherwise it's good but not great,7,17 January 2017,"After TIME magazine called The Princess and the Frog ""the best film of 2009"" and my folks sang its praises, perhaps it was only natural that the bar would be set too high. Then again, it's possible that I have been spoiled for so long by the brilliant originality displayed year after year by Pixar that a princess tale by Disney Animation Studios which adheres strictly to formula was bound to disappoint, even slightly. I suppose I should be pleased that Frog was as enjoyable as it was; I was glad to have seen it, and children likely will be more so. Then again, with some potentially nightmare- inducing scenes, maybe not.I'll return to that in a moment. For now, as they say, back to formula. Princess character to inspire a whole new wave of Halloween costumes, PJ's, coloring books, and must-have dolls? Check. Anthropomorphized animals that sing, dance, provide comic relief, and play to broad cultural stereotypes? Check. Musical numbers to spice things up? Check. Power-hungry villain whose nefarious plot happens to involve breaking up the princess' romance? Check. Message about being true to yourself and chasing your dreams? Check. Happily ever after ending? Checkmate.Then again, enough ingredients have been changed to keep it fun. As has been highly publicized, the princess character this time is African-American, and the diversity is very welcome. Though it's true that America has no royalty, the title makes sense by the finale. The combination of a black lead with a New Orleans setting allows for the standard musical numbers to be boosted by Gospel and jazz styles that are truly catchy and stand uniquely apart from Disney's admittedly excellent, but generally uniform, musical canon.The traditional animation, especially the attention to detail in recreating New Orleans, is stunning, providing some hope for the future of hand-drawn animation in today's computer-generated market. The peripheral characters, including a trumpet-playing bayou alligator, a Cajun firefly, and redneck hunters, are amusing. However, Disney is lucky that, in my experience, people from the South tend to have a better sense of humor than the rest of us about being portrayed through the lens of cultural stereotypes, otherwise they'd have a real uproar on their hands.The broad characterization of the prince, however, was less charming to me than it seems meant to be. Sounding like a poor man's Antonio Banderas, the writers seem to overestimate his entertainment value. I'm sure many will find him hilarious, and I thought he was likable enough, but from time to time I found him mildly annoying, as if the filmmakers were trying to capitalize on the popularity of the much funnier Puss-in-Boots from the Shrek films.On the plus side, it helps that the message about chasing your dreams and being true to yourself is bolstered this time by very clear moral instruction about working hard instead of merely wishing upon a star. This, coupled with the culturally diverse cast of characters, can be appreciated by children and adults alike.Of concern to parents should be the portrayal of voodoo magic by the villain, specifically with regards to the creepy animation of his ""friends on the other side,"" evil spirits who do his bidding after he makes a pact with them. Drawn as shadows, they are nevertheless quite scary. As an adult viewer, I wasn't especially troubled by it: the voodoo magic is shown as evil and the villain pays the price for meddling with it. But as someone who had very young children with him, I was concerned about nightmares and found myself thinking that the film should have been PG instead of G.Fans of classic Disney princess tales should find much to enjoy here, and others likely won't regret seeing it. But with apologies to TIME magazine, The Princess and the Frog is not the year's best film. That title belongs to Pixar's Up.",The Princess and the Frog

Dr Facilier steals every scene he's in, and ""Friends on the Other Side"" is an absolute jam. ""Almost There"" is also in my top 3 favorite Disney songs, it's amazing, uplifting and such a positive song. It helps that Tiana is my favorite Disney princess, and one of my favorite characters in fiction altogether. She's a perfect role model for kids and grownups alike, no matter what gender. It's really after she gets turned into a frog where I start to lose interest in the whole movie. I'd just love to see it all be about Tiana trying to get and run her restaurant, not a ""trying to get home"" and ""magic voodoo"" story.

124,thesubstream,A disappointing return to traditional animation.,4,4 January 2010,"The Princess and The Frog could have, probably should have been good.Disney's return to classic 2D features Ron Clements (The Little Mermaid, Aladdin), the godfather of Disney's late 80's renaissance at the helm. Those films were landmarks: visually captivating, filled with bright, inventive environments, fast paced action and animation both subtle and vigorous. More important, though, is Clements' ability to create endearing, engaging characters and shape stories that often carry the timeless quality of true fairy tales. All of the traditional Clements elements are in The Princess and The Frog – a down-and-out protagonist with ambitions just beyond her grasp, a self-assured, cocky yet charming companion who gets knocked down a peg or two, an evil antagonist with supernatural powers and a support cast of talking, singing animals. The elements are there, but something in the mix doesn't quite work, certainly not in the way that Clements' earlier work did. The animation feels flat and uninspired. Scenes are blocked quite wide, and takes are long and sustained, often slowing the pacing down to a grinding halt. Musical and action sequences are full of missed opportunities, scenes that should be good simply aren't. One musical number features thousands of fireflies lighting the path through the darkened bayou for the protagonists, but lacks the cinematic splendor that it should possess. It's almost as if in an attempt to throwback to films like Aladdin and Mermaid, he overshot the mark by an extra 30 years, and the result feels oddly old-fashioned. Clements' films usually have a good sense of humour – a humour that stems from situation and character rather that the pop-culture-reference well that films like the Shrek series have taken non-Pixar animation. However, jokes in The Princess and The Frog are too few and far between. It's not that they're lame, it's that they're just not there, and the support characters (the aforementioned talking animals) that should provide a steady stream of comic relief simply aren't that funny. The film does possess some endearing qualities. The spoiled Charlotte La Bouff (Jennifer Cody) and her bend-over-backwards father, the wealthy ""Big Daddy"" provide laughs but don't have enough screen time. The protagonist Tiana, voiced and sung by Anika Noni Rose has some serious vox, but her songs are forgettable (as, for that matter, are all of the rest of them). Older audiences may appreciate a level of meta-Princess tale – the tongue in cheek remarks to ""sleeping beauty"", ""prince charming"" and advice like ""when you wish a star, and work really hard towards your goals, your dreams might come true"", as well as the clear nods to other Clement films – previous Disney princesses appear as dolls on a bookshelf, the evil Dr. Facilier is likely a distant cousin of Jafar, King Titus makes and appearance as a parade float, and so on, and so on. But these elements will likely be overlooked by the intended audience, and aren't enough to sustain adult interest.Maybe I'm just too old to appreciate this movie, but I think it panders to a demographic of pre-cognitive, non-discerning 5-year olds who may hold this film nostalgically in their adolescence due to their parents' claims that ""you used to love this movie"". Though filled with good intentions, it's mostly boring, hardly funny, and easily forgettable. Watch the One Jump Ahead sequence from Aladdin for more entertainment and inspiration in 2.5 minutes then Princess and the Frog carries in 80. 4/10",The Princess and the Frog
125,newkidontheblock,By Jove...it's actually GOOD!,9,3 January 2010,"I've said my share of disparaging words against the Walt Disney Company, and let's face it; they've put out more than their share of garbage over the years. It seems as if Pixar has been pulling their dead weight for the past decade as they've put out offensively bad DTV releases and pumping their money and resources into their sub par T.V. station and musical acts (though I will say that Lilo and Stitch, as well as The Emperor's New Groove, which I consider to be one of Disney's funniest releases). Yes, it seemed that all hope was lost for the Mouse and that anything original and thought provoking associated with the Disney name would have that cute little bouncing lamp right along side.Imagine my surprise when I saw The Princess and the Frog yesterday. Surprise nothing! I nearly went into a shock induced coma. This was a brilliant film, something truly worthy of Uncle Walt's iconic signature. This film had all the makings of a Disney classic: great story, great characters, great music, and of course, great art.One thing I always give the Walt Disney Co. credit for is their masterful art work in their features, even the less than stellar ones. This has, especially, been the case the past 20-25 years. Some of the same artists that worked on the more recent classics like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast worked on Princess and the Frog. I was told after the film that the same man that drew Belle (Randy Cartwright) drew for Tiana, and you can tell. The art in general in this movie is extremely impressive. Not only are all the characters well drawn, but the backgrounds are breath taking, very reminiscent of Hunchback of Notre Dame. They seem to take you into a painting of the location without losing it's touch with reality. Also, the use of different art styles stood out, especially the ""Almost There"" number, which was drawn mostly in the Art Deco style.Randy Newman's score left the biggest impression on my after the film was over, though. I think this is the first time a Disney feature used, primarily, North American music styles like jazz, ragtime, southern gospel, and even zydeco. Of course, like any great Disney feature; Princess and the Frog had it's signature musical number: the previously named ""Almost There"". With a great tune, appropriate lyrics, and of course, the voice of Anika Noni Rose; I'm sure (and I hope) this will become another Disney standard. Unlike some Disney films, there wasn't that dreadful ""Oh dear merciful God, when is this going to end"" number. Every song was thought out, appropriate for it's setting, and just...good. Kudos to Randy Newman, who will hopefully get an Oscar nomination (at least) for this film.Then, of course, there's the high water mark for not only Disney movies, but for movies in general, especially animation films: characters and story. Movies can have an amazing score and even good animation, but if the story flops and if the characters are insufferable, then it's going nowhere. This movie, thankfully, had neither problem. There was no character that you wish would just go get himself or herself bent. Everyone served his or her purpose in the movie.Like many of the newer Disney movies, The Princess and the Frog had a, well...Princess character that was blue collar and hard working.Tiana is young woman from the slums of New Orleans, whose sole purpose in life is to open up a successful restaurant serving authentic Louisiana cuisine. Of course, the man puts her down and she finds herself sunk. I will say that I'm VERY proud of Disney for not shoving the race issue down our throats and, at the same time, for not avoiding it all together. This was seen in the scene where the land lords of the building she's looking to purchase.At the same time, a lazy hedonistic prince comes to New Orleans looking for a (Rich) bride since his monetary supply has been cut off by his parents. He sets his sights on a bona fide southern belle named Charlotte, Tiana's foil and best friend. The Prince and his reluctant English servant (what prince would be complete without one) get sidetracked by a voodoo man/street performer named Dr. Facilier aka ""The Shadow Man"", a slick deceitful crook with his own silhouette as a side kick (and yes, they are able to make it work). Dr. Facilier says both Prince Naveeh and Lawerence will get what they both desire most (money and a life without servitude, respectively). Louis is turned into the Prince (or at least, given his body) while Naveeh turns into...a smiley frog; which as we learn throughout the film is mucus.Naveeh meets Tiana after she changes clothes (and after her dreams of owning her own restaurant). Tiana, who is less than fond of frog, tries to kill our hero; but later finds out that this is a frog with a difference...he can talk. After Naveeh sees a copy of a print version of, appropriately enough, the Princess and the Frog, he asks Tiana (Who is wearing a tiara at the time) to kiss him, believing that she is, indeed, royalty herself; though he later finds out that she is a waitress. He promises that after she kisses him, something she is far from enthusiastic about, he will make her dream of owning her own restaurant a reality. Well, she does kiss him, but there's a bit of a SNAFU: she turns into a frog herself. The two of them must find a way to become human again. Along the way, they meet a cavalcade of characters including a trumpet playing alligator (and yes, they are able to make it work somehow) and a Cajun firefly named Ray.The Princess and the Frog, a movie (I hope) that is destined for greatness.",The Princess and the Frog
126,rockinkettles-1,Another Disney Classic-One of the Best,10,15 January 2010,"It's about time Disney made a new movie with the traditional animation. I like some of the computer animated movies too, but there is nothing like the hand drawn Disney magic. Princess is one of the best since Tarzan. It has classic characters and good fun songs. My favorite character is Louis the crocodile. He was funny and gave the movie that spark of comic relief. The twist of the story, as I'm sure you all know, is that Princess Tiana is turned into a frog when she kisses the Frog Prince Naveen. Soon they are off on an adventure in the swamps of New Orleans to find Mama Odie,the voodoo woman, to break the spell. The evil voodoo Dr. Facilier is the one who turned them into frogs for his benefit to become rich. He is one of the best villains since Jafar in Alladin.

The message(s) is a relevant one, although it may be a bit too deep for the kids. Not to worry though, the kids will still love it. There's something for everyone. I was not familiar with The Frog Prince, but the message here is one of the perils of 'selling your soul,' serving money rather than your own heart (love or what's really important, however you want to say it), and there is even a bit of a death and rebirth side-theme that would make any Christian scholar proud. I am convinced they modeled the rich white girl on Paula Deen! Artistically and thematically, the voodoo mysticism and New Orleans/Bayou setting really work! Very romantic backdrop. I don't think Disney could have done it better for what they were going for. This one will definitely join the ranks of the other animated Disney classics.",The Princess and the Frog
128,Apemangalore,Reiterates that Walt Disney Animation is back and here to stay,9,11 December 2009,"With such disappointments as Home on the Range and Chicken Little, Walt Disney Animation Studios – on the whole – has had a pretty rough decade. Last November, however, the Mouse House released Chris Williams and Byron Howards' Bolt, which is not only generally accepted as a return to form for the studio, but over the course of this past year, has usurped Pulp Fiction as my personal favorite movie of all time. With that said, I went into The Princess and the Frog with relatively high expectations; having walked out of the theatre just a couple of hours ago, I have to say that John Musker and Ron Clements' latest - while not overthrowing it - certainly continues the magic of the studio's previous film.Visually, The Princess and the Frog is absolutely mesmerizing. Seriously, 2D animation has never looked better than it does in this film. As executive producer/Pixar founder John Lasseter said, it's very much like stepping into a pair of old, comfortable shoes. Familiar, yet seemingly brand new. The energetic look of New Orleans is perfectly captured on screen, enhancing the story all the more.Speaking of which, the story of this film is just like the animation in that, while being traditional Disney fare, it's executed in such a way that it feels completely different from anything you've ever experienced. As many times as this movie will make you laugh, it'll make you cry, which – for me – has always been the sign of a classic Disney Animation film. The movie also succeeds in making you feel invested in each and every one of these characters, major and minor ones alike, which is definitely one of the most difficult tasks that any film could hope to achieve.Unlike most Disney princesses, Tiana is strong, independent, and isn't looking for her Prince Charming. In fact, it's these differentiating traits of hers that make Tiana my favorite Disney princess to date. It also helps that Anika Noni Rose delivers a stunning performance as her voice, making Tiana all the more captivating every moment that she's on screen. Bruno Campos also does a terrific job as Naveen, whose character is also a departure from the traditional Disney prince. He's a fellow who, while being stuck-up and lazy, somehow manages to come across as extremely likable. Both of these characters make for what is easily the most convincing Disney couple to date.The real stand-out performance, however, is that of Keith David as Dr. Facilier. Since his performance as the Arbiter from the Halo video game series, I've been a huge fan of this guy's work, and couldn't have been more excited when I heard that he'd be doing the voice of the villain in this movie. With his low, creepy voice, David captures the essence of this character perfectly, and by the end, you're genuinely scared of this guy. Because of this, Facilier is definitely one of – if not my absolute favorite – Disney villain, challenged only by Gaston and Frollo. With his performance as the Cat from Coraline, and now Facilier, Keith David continues to prove that he is the man.As with every other aspect of the film, the musical numbers in The Princess and the Frog are extremely memorable, most notably Dr. Facilier's ""Friends On the Other Side"", a deliciously creepy piece that ranks right up there with ""Hellfire"" from Hunchback of Notre Dame as one of the best Disney villain songs. You'll definitely find yourself humming several of these tunes on your way back home from the theatre.The Princess and the Frog is an excellent return to 2D animation. The animation is more beautiful than ever, the characters are some of the most memorable ones I've ever seen on film, and the musical numbers are infectiously catchy. The Princess and the Frog clearly reiterates the statement already made by last year's aforementioned Bolt: Walt Disney Animation is back and here to stay.",The Princess and the Frog

Disney had seemingly abandoned hand-drawn animation years ago- not without reason either, as their collaboration with Pixar has certainly yielded some great films. However, the return to 'classic' animation is a welcome one in this reviewer's eyes. I loved films like The Lion King and Aladdin as a kid, and to me, they represent the very pinnacle of Disney. The Princess and the Frog, for me, joins this elite group.The story is handled very well. It's a fun film with catchy songs and real heart. There are lessons for the main characters to learn but the film does not preach, nor dumb down. It is marketed at kids, but it is a family movie that everyone can enjoy.",The Princess and the Frog

After a 5-year hiatus and the determinations of John Lasseter & Ed Catmull, they have brought back traditional hand-drawn animation; making ""The Princess & the Frog"" as the 45th hand-drawn feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics.The story of ""The Princess & the Frog"" goes back to the familiar Broadway style musical, with all the characters spontaneously breaking out into songs. I like all the songs and they're catchy, but most of them seemed out of place and breaks the flow of the story. The 2nd half of the film was better than the 1st half, as it starts kind of messy and jumps too quickly before completely defining & establishing their supporting characters; although the ending was unique and satisfying.I was expecting more out of this film, but it's nice to see a movie like this again. This is a style of film making that you just don't see anymore in your computer animated movies. Even though ""The Princess & the Frog"" doesn't compare to The Little Mermaid, Beauty & the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King; the Walt Disney Animation Department is moving back into the right direction.",The Princess and the Frog

It wasn't. It's BEYOND bad. Something went wrong. What was it? I'll say what went wrong: EVERYTHING! The characters, plot, songs... 'The Princess and the Frog' is a horrible experience in every level that I call one word: overwhelmingly tragic. It provided me with the most unpleasant experience I've ever had at the cinema. I say if get's rereleased in cinemas in the future it will be a very jarring and uncomptable experience for many teens and adults. For the whole 97 minutes it's all about a princess that has to kiss a frog of a man after a witch doctor curses him. All it is is ripping or scrunching up a piece of paper and throwing it in the bin. The best thing about this film is the creepy villain, Docter Faciliar who, that I think should've won the game. If you are going to buy this in a DVD shop then don't bother at all unless it's for a really young child, otherwise you will be sorely disappointed. If you're going to watch a Disney/pixar film on a Friday or holiday night with your family, watch 'Toy Story 3' or 'Monsters Inc' instead of watching this old rubbish. It makes 'The Lion King' look like a someone's face buried in popcorn. I think this should be ranked as the worst film of 2009. Not just that. It's the worst film of the decade. It's literally that bad.",The Princess and the Frog
132,wwefreakjon,I don't understand the 7.5,1,5 April 2010,"This movie was a piece of garbage. Typically I would write a very fair minded review but as a kid that grew up during the golden age of Disney films (1989-1999) this film was a severe disappointment. The film takes place in a 1920's New Orleans and stars a young woman names Tiana. Not a princess mind you, a poor black woman who longs to complete her fathers dream and open a restaurant. She is not a princess, and she doesn't long to be a princess. So there's is plot failure one. If that had been all I wouldn't have hated the movie, but there was so much more. This film is supposed to be a throw back to the golden age of Disney but the plot is incredibly thin. Every plot point, is one you can see right through and the one place where it seems they make an interesting twist, is ended in such a cheesy predictable way that it ruins any of the good parts that came before it. The next problem is the characters. With the exception of the Firefly, Ray, who provided the only good laughs in the film, every character was one dimensional and typically an amalgamation of older Disney characters. The biggest example of this was the villain. He was a mix of Hades from Hercules, Ursula from the Little Mermaid and Scar from the lion king. If you can't see it in the character alone then just pay close attention to all the imagery and you will see the similarities. The biggest problem however was the music. Yes, little kids will enjoy it because it is catchy but the thing to remember is that the songs were written by Randy Newman. This is the guy that wrote ""When She loved me"" from Toy Story 2. The music in this film is all simple and terribly cliché. Overall I would give this a 4 out of 10 but because of how high the overall rating is on here I am giving it a 1 out of 10.",The Princess and the Frog
133,thomas-fackler,Due to Hallucinations Do Not Kiss the Frogs,6,12 July 2015,"A Disney movie of the 90s style with a story with a moral with a tale of whimsy, woe and strength....New Orleans, Creole, and the swampy river delta get their time in the theater through a connection of a young woman with dreams, a young prince with a silver spoon dangling just our of reach, and a set of supporting characters who either are the hand-puppets of the Gods, fall in love with stars, or toot their own horn in a jazzy sort of way. All together they form a lovely set that is par for the Disney course. Good fluff and fun for the family.What is left behind is the history of each culture appropriated, something that Disney has successfully and unsuccessfully done through the years. Little bits and pieces come up such as the big house in with the princess within and the little houses where the help must return. Setting all of this aside is a necessity for enjoyment, but those who view the show with an eye for details might ask how many frogs were licked to make a story in the given setting seem real even with all of the magic of voodoo.",The Princess and the Frog
134,Sherrill777,A bit of a disappointment,6,26 November 2017,"The Bad:The prince is fairly revolting, in my opinion. He starts out feeling like a lazy, womanizing, cheat who is looking for a ticket to an easy life. He does acquire a few redeeming qualities as the film progresses, but I ended up feeling like our lovely heroine falls in love with a loser. This movie loses a whole star just for him. My second issue with this movie is the voodoo. Some parents might not have an issue with this – and I don't have a problem with most magic depicted in kid's movies, so I'm not sure why this bothers me so much. Maybe because some people actually practice this as a real art rather than a fantasy type of magic? Maybe because it felt like a nightmare-inducing pact with evil? In any case, it came across as far too creepy & dark for my tastes. The Good: The visuals are genuinely lovely. It's a very pretty movie. And it's fantastic to have an African American heroine princess. Yay diversity! I felt that this movie was respectful of a minority group. Our heroine is full of excellent character traits – she's resourceful, hard-working, a good friend, optimistic, and more. The music is a bit jazzy, a bit southern gospel, and not bad at all (although not some of Disney's best).The Mom view:Not one of my favorite Disney films, which was so disappointing since I was excited to see Disney return to traditional fairy-tales – and with a non-white princess, no less! But, between the less than stellar prince, the creepy voodoo, and the forgettable story-line, this isn't going to be one I purchase for my kids. I'll have my kids watch this at some point (probably late elementary age), but only as a rental. Overall, this gets a grade of 'not horrible, but not great'.",The Princess and the Frog
135,stealth4933,Disney is back,8,18 March 2010,"Well it is no mystery that Pixar has been beating Disney lately. Its not even a stretch to assume that Dreamworks has been beating Disney. Disney hasn't come out with anything to compare to Shrek or Monsters Inc. The reason for this is that Disney has lost everything that made their movies good. That was charm, wittiness, and a plot. Disney has just become obsessed with making crappy sequels to Disney classics, hoping to make some more off the success of their older films. Well The Princess and the Frog is here, those times are over. Princess and the Frog blew me away. I liked it just as much as any other animated films I've ever seen. The music was the first thing that caught me. It was very jazzy, which was very good with the whole New Orleans feel. One thing that Disney has classically been good at is suiting the music to the setting. The Italian music in the Lady and the Tramp, the African music of the Lion King, and now the New Orleans music in the Princess and the Frog are all good examples. The next aspect that lends itself to this movie is the ending. In the end everything is tied together in a very happy, slightly cheesy way. The two main characters ended up together, the supporting characters achieved their goals, and the bad guy found retribution. However, the one thing I love about this movie, that every good Disney movie has, is the feel it leaves you. I am slightly embarrassed to admit it, but I felt giddy after I watched this film... all three times! In my mind that is how a Disney film is supposed to make you feel. At the risk of sounding cheesy, this movie made me believe in magic and believe that anything could happen. Lets hope that this is the start of a beautiful Disney Restoration (lets not forget that I was the first to coin that phrase).",The Princess and the Frog
136,Rafacus,"Don't believe the racialized hype, It's an Entrepreneur's tale of love",7,11 December 2009,"The Princess and The Frog is a beautifully drawn, well animated slice of the standard Disney pie with a Louisiana spin. Although I found all of the characters to be very lovable, I thought that Disney's ""playing it safe"" (you know exactly what I mean) due to a bunch of jackasses who blindly let a trailer mislead them, ultimately hurt the movie where it could have been a lot more dynamic.From the wee age of a little girl, Tiana (Anika Toni Rose) and her father James (Terrence Howard) had always dreamed of owning their own restaurant. Her mastery of cooking from her mother, combined with her respect for hard-work from her father, has made her into a very level headed young woman. Still the hardships of being born poor made the only shining light seem that concept of a jumping restaurant of happy patrons and good cuisine. On the other side of town, Tiana's best friend Charlotte (Jennifer Cody) is very much the princess, with her father 'Big Daddy' La Bouff (John Goodman) buying her anything her little heart desired except for a prince to whisk her off her feet.Although birds of a different feather, Charlotte and Tiana are very much friends and when word comes to town that a prince was to be within their very midst, Charlotte makes it her mission to woo him and Tiana continues to save her tips in order to buy her restaurant. When the evil Dr. Facilier comes into the mix of these people's lives, things get complicated as Tiana and Prince Naveen are turned into frogs, and the popular fairytale of the frog Prince takes a turn for the worst.The Princess and the Frog offers up a tremendous amount of positives where many people will be digging for negatives. Tiana isn't the standard damsel in distress, nor is she the rubber-necking, sassy stereotype. I loved this character in terms of her being the epitome of the modern woman – ambitious to a fault, hardworking and all the while maintaining an air of femininity and vulnerability at the same time. In contrast the price, Naveen (Bruno Campos) is a playboy, not the brightest bulb in the set and comes off a bit childish like Tiana's buddy Charlotte. Kind of a jab at the trust-fund babies in the audience I would assume. At the heart of it all there is the ever present moral that if you follow your wishes they will come true, no matter how bizarre and unreal. If I had a daughter I would want her to watch and own this movie, based on Tiana alone. Her dynamic is a strong one and modern day princesses could really learn a thing or two from a two job hustling entrepreneur in training.Then as you know it IS Disney, so the villain's song has to be the highlight of the movie. The deep, menacing voice of Keith David wasn't as scary as I expected it to be, but his song of ""having friends on the other side"" was my favorite of the many songs included. And Ray (Jim Cummings) the Cajun firefly ran a close second, still. The music sets the mood quite well and the only drawback to all of this, was that the central romance story seemed to take a backseat to everything else going on. Dare I say Tiana and Naveen's love seemed a bit (gasp) rushed? In the span of a traumatic experience, a playboy like Naveen starts to make eyes at the cute little waitress. I did not see love, I saw lust, admiration and need but not the ""I want to marry you"" love, that did not work out so well for me. If this were real life, Naveen would have got the panties from Tiana and not much else.If the central romance was orchestrated a tad better, it would have been more believable but it seemed as if Tiana and Naveen got together for the hell of it, rather than growing to really have feelings for one another. With the large talent pool brought together for this movie - Terrence Howard, Oprah Winfrey and Keith David, The Princess and The Frog will do good, and the art being absolutely beautiful, may sober the speculating mob a tad.Staying relatively light and cute for the early parts of the story, I will warn that it does get dark near the end, if you are the type of parent to shield your child from death and loss in these things. It was a treat to watch, and Disney hasn't skipped a beat, outside of ugly stereotypes of movies past. You should see The Princess and The Frog and you should bring your daughter with you, for the more Princess Tiana's we have in the world, the better for all of us.More of my reviews at www.SpicyMovieDogs.com",The Princess and the Frog

139,soloriamagic08,Unfortunately Disney's clichéd cheese still reigns supreme.,3,5 April 2010,"This movie should not have been called the princess and the frog. It should have been a truly original magical story. However, Disney chose a story that had already been done before, and even with the twist it was still a boring, clichéd affair. It's like the ticked off every cliché they could for the characters, especially the mains, and the whole overall package itself. However, cliché or not the execution is what I have a problem with not necessarily that I've seen this all before.Characters-Tiana and Naveen are both likable, in a they are clearly on the good side so they have that tis a good person so they will be liked even a bit armor on them, but nothing goes deeper than that. They are good,but boring. I didn't care about their plight. Or them.Their love story was very, very forced, and they barely had personalities.The little that was there was of course Disney's cheese-box of clichés 101.It definitely didn't help that Tiana was human for about 15 minutes, and then she's a frog the rest of the time. Except for the end. Naveen was human for less. Not only that,but they met in passing,as humans once, in a super fast scene with no dialog. There was no build up to their *romance*, and apparently the art of flashbacks to give us more insight into their individual characters is beneath Disney.The supporting cast was boring as well,but Lotte Tiania's friend was amusing to a point, and Ray the firefly was nice to. The villain was interesting,but his plan was not well thought out, and really didn't make all the much sense at the start.Plot- boring pack of clichés from the dialog to well everything. Tiana's a workaholic and wants a restaurant. She saves up to buy one.Blah,blah, blah. She goes to her rich, dumb blond best friend's party and meets a frog. Cue *twist* etc.I didn't care about the characters, and I certainly didn't care about the story.Also what didn't help was the transition was done very, very, poorly in this movie. It doesn't give you time to breath.To suck in the emotion you should be feeling for a scene. The characters talk, move, and emote so fast it's on to the next scene before you can feel anything with them. It's like the developers had a mild form of ADD. That's not good when your trying to tell a story, and make your audience give a fig about the characters in it.Music- I hated all the songs. Every last one of them. They were horribly written and forgettable. Amusingly and sadly the villain song everyone goes crazy for, Friends on the Other Side, was the worst one. Which is not saying much since all the songs were really bad.Graphics- never listen to the hype. Graphics looked just like their other 2D films. Just like them. Nice, but nothing spectacular. I assure you my eyes were not having eye-gasms at any point in this movie. As a matter of fact some of the locals and magic used were very ugly and poorly done. Especially when it came to color. Looked almost like a Saturday morning cartoon in way to many places.Bottom-line: Glad this was borrowed from one of my sisters friends. It's definitely a rental not a buy. Could have been gold, but Disney went the clichéd cheese predictable route hard on pretty much everything. Start thinking outside the mainstream velvetta box. You can still have a interesting, child friendly, story and characters by not putting such boring velvetta all over everything. Changing the skin color of your protagonists was a start, but you still need work when it comes to dialog, story, character personalities, and just the overall package.",The Princess and the Frog

I can look past almost every other hangup I might have with a movie if I am genuinely entertained, but not boredom. Not to say that the entire movie was boring, but enough that I did notice it, and when you get to point in a movie where you don't really care what is going on, well... that pretty much ends it.

I know that most Disney movies have their predictable elements, but this movie seemed so by- the-numbers that it never surprised me and never moved outside the box.",The Princess and the Frog
141,jhunt709,Almost There.,9,19 February 2010,"For years, it seems, The Walt Disney Company has been living in the computer-generated shadow of an animation studio that they now own. With their technique, traditions and tales differing considerably from the House of Mouse (either in its golden era or beyond the Renaissance), Pixar Animation Studios have successfully brought CGI to the forefront of the industry with a loving approach to storytelling reminiscent of Disney's own rise to glory. With audiences worldwide enthralled by this new medium, the method of hand-drawn animation that brought to life Disney's most beloved characters was slowly but surely phased out, with Disney sadly resorting to uninspiring direct-to-video releases and lackluster attempts at recreating the Pixar standard. Now, with John Lasster at the helm as chief creative officer of both studios, Disney have produced their latest feature, 'The Princess and the Frog', in the familiar two-dimensional style of the original Classics cannon.In terms of technicality the film is obviously distinct from the CGI releases of today, but is just as stunning and matches it in terms of warmth and colour. It is a shame that many will undoubtedly judge 'The Princess and the Frog' as a technological step backwards, especially when so many youngsters are being raised on 'Shrek' and even Pixar's own product. Disney take good advantage of the versatility of hand-drawn animation, resulting in memorable musical numbers and magical special effects, and for many viewers it will revitalise their interest in the format.Set in 1920s New Orleans, which in turn is set to a swinging jazz soundtrack, Disney's first African-American princess (a minor breakthrough considering the true achievements of this film) unwittingly becomes involved in a voodoo curse after kissing a prince placed under the same enchantment, turning them both into frogs. Refreshingly, Tiana and Naveen have a completely human spectrum of personality traits in either form that expresses both their character's flaws and qualities; they are not drawn as the golden girl and the hero, instead exuding likable and compromising attributes throughout the film, leading viewers on an emotional roller-coaster similar to their own. The supporting cast serves as, but is not limited to, comic relief, and even the more broadly drawn individuals ultimately break their cliché. The film itself of course adheres to the happily-ever-after template, but it's what Disney do best and 'The Princess and the Frog' would not be a worthy throwback if it departed from the foundations and limitations of the fairy tale genre. Instead, the film builds on these foundations, taking a great many elements from previous releases such as 'The Jungle Book' and 'Cinderella' and incorporating them into its own story with a novel spin that leaves them recognisable but relevant to the reinvigoration of Disney animation that Tiana's story is ultimately being told for.Perhaps the most noticeable influence Pixar's features have had on this film is the sheer bravery of numerous aspects, where art, creativity and originality aren't sacrificed for the sake of avoiding alienating potential audiences. For example, the music has a thorough jazz feel that immediately distances itself from the popular sound and structure of songs from earlier Disney features. This may cause problems for those whose tastes differ or for youngsters who are more captivated by Broadway style numbers, however the music is inviting and the visuals accompanying it grow more spectacular as the movie progresses. The antagonist, a voodoo 'shadowman' with 'friends on the other side' could prove frightening to particularly younger viewers, though the decision to include a darker villain adds welcome weight to the proceedings, with his ending a far cry from the humiliation and jest previous Disney rogues have faced following their downfalls.'The Princess and The Frog' is told in the traditional Disney fashion that honours their legacy as makers of magic, reminding us why we have enough faith in them to believe that their wishing star will shine brightly in the sky once more. They may not have won everyone back for now, but they're almost there, they're almost there...9/10",The Princess and the Frog

All of this changes when the dashing and handsome 20 year old Prince Naveen comes to town.But his trip to having fun and swooning the pretty ladies doesn't last forever when he meets a man named Dr. Facilier with mystical powers of magic voo-doo, changes him into a frog. Now Naveen must need Tiana's help with just one little kiss that could change him back into a human. After the quick little peck on the lips, not only does the plan fail, but also it changes Tiana into a frog too.The movie in it carries a lot of warm heart and soul, much like all of the old Disney movies that everyone has grown up with as a kid through their childhood.

149,smiley_pat77,Tiana goes for the American Dream,9,17 July 2010,"Not until the final month do we get this decade's first truly satisfying feature length animated musical from Disney (although there's only been a handful of attempts). This is a rebirth of Disney film-making in the traditional sense. To watch this movie is to watch something magical that hasn't happened in nearly a dozen years.There are a variety of opinions concerning which Disney films of the Disney Renaissance era are better than others, but I'm going to take it upon myself to say that the last great traditional animated film was The Lion King in 1994. Good films still came out and Alan Menken continued to put together some wonderful soundtracks for the remainder of the decade, but the new millennium has not shown much promise.What really sells The Princess and the Frog is that it tells a story worth telling (take note Dreamworks) and tells it well. As the second American protagonist (after Pocahantas), Tiana stands apart from many of the other Disney princesses as being the first to seek the American Dream. She aspires to own a restaurant and works two jobs to save up enough money for the down payment. Unlike Ariel, Belle and Jasmine, she does not dream of an escape from her current lifestyle. She is satisfied until she hits a roadblock with her plans which then cues our inciting incident.Along the way she learns to place family and relationships above her personal dreams. A very modern message to say the least. There is a particularly powerful moment when the villain tempts her with a virtual tour of the restaurant she desires to have and a flashback with her father.Two years ago, Enchanted reminded us of what we were missing out on. For those of us whose childhood took place during the Renaissance era, it was a refreshing and extremely nostalgic experience to see Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz at work again. The filmmakers for that movie knew it too. The way in which the sequence for the catchy number ""That's How You Know"" plays out was... well, enchanting. My only disappointment with ""The Princess and the Frog"" is that it lacks a really moving score from Randy Newman and while the musical numbers are fun and energetic, what's missing is the one song that encompasses the emotions of the film the way ""Beauty and the Beast"" did for Beauty and the Beast or ""A Whole New World"" did for Aladdin. Alan Menken will fortunately be back with 2010's Repunzel. However, that movie will involve CGI with the ""intention to look and feel like traditional hand-drawn animation"" (a curious description indeed). Time will tell if Disney can get any momentum going off the wake of The Princess and the Frog, a film that deserves to take its place amongst the studio's numerous animated greats.",The Princess and the Frog

The dixieland jazz was a treat too.I haven't a single critical thing to say about this movie. the art and colour were great, the songs were fun and engaging, the drama was real, the humour was good natured, and the themes resonated.To use an overused phrase, it's a classic.",The Princess and the Frog

I am so glad they finally (after waiting way too long) to come out with a beautiful African American princess. I myself even enjoyed it as an adult watching with my kids. This film is great in every sense of the word, for every Disney fan regardless of race, culture, or background.

The way the subject matter ( magic , voodoo etc) is presented definite pushes way into pg-13. It scared the hell out of my 4 year old and he ran out of the room, at least that's what my wife told me. I started watching it because my wife had rented it PPV and there was time left on the show. After about 10-15 minutes I turned it off since I didn't see any redeeming value to it , it was to occult oriented, boring, and creepy for me, the subject matter was way too mature for my 4 year old. Disney has always liked to push the dark subject matter in my opinion. Don't get me wrong I've enjoyed a lot of Disney's shows, but to me this one is a bit too Dark for a G movie the way the subject matter is presented.",The Princess and the Frog
156,LigiaMontoya,Fan-frigging-tastic,10,12 December 2009,"Just astounding. The story was genuinely touching, the intense scenes jumped out at you, the humor was funny, the acting was excellent, and the music was the best soundtrack of any Disney movie since The Little Mermaid (A standing ovation for Randy Newman). There is also something about the 2D animation - it just has more personality and emotion than CGI. I just saw it tonight, and I am honestly floored.Disney, for the last few years, has suffered from a lack of creativity. The movies have all been interchangeable with the same plot recycled. This one is different, new and really just the best animated picture I've seen in a long, long time. The applause in the theatre was very much earned.",The Princess and the Frog

158,nickdelopes,Beautiful,10,11 December 2009,"As a native of Louisiana, this film struck a chord that might not happen to natives of other states. The film was gorgeously rendered, and it captured the flair that makes our state so special. Ther were even jokes that only a Louisianian would honestly get. Disney returns with visual flair, quick and witty jokes, and a story. Oh my god, an actual story with meaning. This is not a film that relies on pop culture gags and scatological jokes that so many other animated films seem to rely on. The 2-d animation adds warmth, and it gives you the sense that this was the loving work of a company who takes pride in their work.The voicing was wonderful. I love Aniki, and she gave the character enough sass and smarts to give depth. Dr. Faciliar and his voodoo spirits are creepy enough to freak parents. Full of acid colors that conjure up ghostly imagery. Prince Naveen was full of charm and charisma, and Ray was perfect Cajun. The alligator and Mama Odie had that perfect Louisiana touch. But the best voice work was by Jennifer Cody for Charlotte LaBeouf. Her voicing was perfect and the animation fitted like a glove. Her scratchy voice and accent had depth to it as well. Some might not be able to understand it, but it was beautiful.The visuals were startling, full of color and magic. New Orleans done in rosy hues, the bayou in dampened blues. Contrasts and complements working in harmony. Art Deco flair purveys, bringing the period to life, and there is a sweetness to the visuals that does not have that toxic aftertaste. The music was excellent work, full of jazz and blues and well-crafted lyrics. Randy Newman can take everything Disney throws at him, and make it his own. No song seems out of place or anachronistic, just helps to heighten the joy of animation. It's all done with the Broadway-style numbers and light-heartedness that only Disney can pull off.The story has its own strength. Despite the inevitably soppy happy ending, there is maturity and a good message. It teaches us the value of hard work and the importance of differentiating between what you want and need. The screenplay was quick and witty and original. Animated films seem to be making a comeback in depth (Up, Coraline, and this one). Though some find it inferior to the ones made at the beginning of 1990s, it still stands alone as a major comeback and a new classic for the company we have all grown up with.Overall, a beautiful film, and I highly recommend it.",The Princess and the Frog
159,RitikaS,Inspirational!,9,31 January 2011,"Disney has done it again! 90 minutes of true inspiration. A story about a strong young lady, Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) who wants to open a restaurant, in her father's memory. However as fate has it, when Tiana meets Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos), 'duped' and turned into a frog by the evil Dr Facilier (Keith David), she kisses him, thinking that he would turn Naveen human again. However, she turns into a frog herself. Now setting off to see Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis), to make them human again, with their friends Ray (Jim Cummings) and Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley), the audience discovers along with Naveen and Tiana, that what you want, isn't exactly what you need... you just have to look deeper.A absolute wonderful film, which the family can sit down and watch over and over again. As with any other Disney film, 'The Princess and the Frog' focuses on the theme of not giving up and finding true love. This gives today's youth a positive message of 'when the going gets tough, the tough gets going', as shown by the Fenner brothers, when they reject Tiana's payment for her restaurant. In my opinion, I think that the directors, Ron Clements and John Musker has taken inspiration from their past films like 'The Little Mermaid' and 'The Lion King' which they have incorporated into the film. For example, the scene in which Ray sings 'Evangeline' seems inspired by the scene in 'The Little Mermaid' when Sebastian sings 'Kiss the Girl'. I thought that this was very clever and I must say, Musker and Clements shot it beautifully. Set in 1912, New Orleans it can be seen that the crew of the film have definitely done their research and they show what life was like during that time wonderfully. I think everyone, old and young will definitely enjoy this film, as the songs and storyline are so gripping that you can just forget everything happening in your life, whether good or bad and experience Naveen and Tiana's journey.",The Princess and the Frog

It's funny, entertaining, romantic, and just an overall heartwarming Disney movie. The main characters grow and change throughout the course of the movie, and it's very fun to watch the character development. The main villain is well thought out and interesting. There were no plot holes I could find and the animation is pretty good for it's time. There are jokes for adults and kids which is something I love about Disney movies - it's not only targeted towards one audience. I also appreciate the cultural diversity in this movie.

165,destroy-apathy,"Flipping the Myth, while keeping the charm",7,28 January 2011,"What Happened: Set in New Orleans, this is an inversion of both the Princess and the Frog tale along with he Disney Princess mythos (see below). The frog-based inversion comes as the Princess is turned into a frog after her reptilian kiss rather than revealing the frog as her prince. They then commence their journey to try and regain their human forms, foil the villain's plot to acquire power and wealth, all whilst finding a great deal about themselves, each other, the world, etc, etc. So nothing structurally outside the box, but it doesn't need to be; it does what it needs to do strcturally and creates all the interest thematically.What I read as its theme/message: As eluded to above, it was primarily about admitting to some of the wrongs that Disney may have been guilty of in the past – reinforcing dominant ideologies, marginalising difference and the likes (Note that these features of Disney have in no way affected my enjoyment of some of the greats). Therefore not only was the lead the cultural other, the friend of the – to be expected – Disney Princess archetype, the black working class daughter of a maid, but she at no point showed the 'need' for her prince, her knight in shining armour, to save her. She embodied what would be expected of the empowered, yet still proudly feminine figure. The balance was struck by making her not 'need' these things but still to 'want' them, ultimately making the 'right' choice after believing she didn't have her prince. This balance ensured that the film charmed in a way that Disney manages to do, was full of passion and whimsy, but the emphasis on want rather than need took her away from being a 'passive' female, yet not too far to be wooden and preachy; she was a well rounded individual.What it did particularly well: It was as charming and as fun as a Disney romp should be, whilst making the blatant concessions to Disney's past that I mention above. The songs were mesmerising and the deep south setting was really brought to life.Where it may have fallen short, unimpressed or didn't quite reach potential: It never reached more than just very good. The songs were all enjoyable, but made no lasting impression. Similarly with the supporting characters (except the villain who was great); I liked the crocodile but he was no Timone and Pumba.Performance of the film: The villain voiced by Keith David, really over the top sinisterMost outstanding or memorable feature: The setting: as a post Katrina film, this does a lot to justly glamorise the deep south vibe through the animation, the music, the characters, the food and the emphasis on passion.More film musings and discussion via twitter: destroyapathy",The Princess and the Frog

169,specismaster,Disney has returned,8,23 December 2009,"When I first learned of this film's production in 2006, I was surprised, overjoyed, yet skeptical that hand-drawn animation could successfully be reintroduced to such a disinterested public, still enthralled by the magic of CGI. Lucky for myself and millions of other animation buffs, the art of 2D has returned in full force, and this films succeeds on so many different levels that I just had to write a review.First and foremost; this film, in its storytelling, art and music, is for the most part genuine. In using this word, I mainly mean to differentiate it from its competition; the animated films of the past decade or so have been so ""contemporary"" and self-dating, through their added topical humor (see: Shrek, Home on the Range, Over the Hedge, most CGI films) that I find watching them to be a chore. The Princess and the Frog gains much respect from me by avoiding any superfluous references to the present day, and thereby serves well serves the purpose of an animated movie: to make the audience forget about their own dreary lives for 90 minutes by transporting them to a time and place far away from anything they've ever seen, heard or otherwise known.Speaking of musicals, there's plenty of music in this film, and it's all wonderful. The sheer density of the brilliantly staged and animated musical numbers almost made me dizzy, to the point that I wished for one long, quiet stretch; however, I gave Disney the benefit of the doubt here, as the children of 2009 are probably a bit more wired and less patient than those of, say, 1994 (when I, at age four, took my very first trip to the theater to see The Lion King, an impeccably paced feature), and they still make up the bulk of this picture's audience.As for the animation: flawlessly expressive and fluid, for the most part, and even an improvement on most of Disney's recent past (save for The Rescuers Down Under, which, like The Princess and the Frog, was produced on new software previously unused for a ""canon"" Disney feature, and probably served therefore as an experiment in animation techniques). If you've a sharp eye, though, you can find two or three brief ""almost completed"" shots, where lipsynch is off. In perspective (3 iffy ones out of several thousand), this is certainly forgivable, though something that might not have passed during Ron Clement's earlier days as director. He's still hauling butt, overall, and I'm happy to see such prolific talents as Andreas Deja (Scar) return to form in the animation department.In regards to Disney's first black princess/heroine? It's about time. I was wondering years ago why Disney had waited until the very end to feature black characters, but it was something I almost never thought about while sitting in the theater, a true marvel given the loaded connotations that are often derived from the ""old South,"" and how easy it is to make certain watchdogs mad. Any ordinary American should be able to watch this film, from start to finish, without much huffing and puffing whatsoever, as every character is treated as more- or-less a functioning human(oid) (save for one particular ""Three Stooges"" inspired sequence, which was funny nonetheless).Do go see this movie. If you have children, bring them; this is a great ""first movie"" experience, and while not necessarily as epic and prolific as The Lion King or Beauty and the Beast, it has earned its place in animation history.",The Princess and the Frog
170,pnwgirl,"Great movie, but not appropriate for very young children",7,26 December 2009,"I've paged through about six or so pages of reviews, and I can't say that I disagree with any of them. The story was good, excellent message, the music was epic and sweeping, and I did truly enjoy it.My only complaint is that we took our five year old (after all, it WAS rated ""G""), and I was astonished at the vivid imagery of the demonic. I didn't really care that it was going to talk about voodoo (I knew that coming in from the trailer) but we watched masks coming to life, spewing flames and contorting into sinister faces, demons coming up out of the ground in the form of wickedly shaped shadows, chasing the ""bad guy"" and dragging him into the flaming mouth of the demonic mask, straight into hell! My poor little guy was completely freaked out, starting crying and we had to step out. Bedtime was fun too, as I got to hear about how afraid he was that the masks were coming to get him. Had I had any idea that this was going to be the case, I would have NEVER taken him. The trailer showed none of this.As an adult, I truly enjoyed the movie, but I think it should have been rated PG, not G, and it's probably not appropriate for under 7.",The Princess and the Frog
171,Matthew12222,Great movie :D Disney quality is back.,9,13 December 2009,"The return to hand draw 2D animation mixed with 3D scenes is great. Sadly the transition relied a bit too much on computers to bring it together.There were mistakes like in a chopping scene, the knife goes through the fingers and other occurrences where objects accidentally pass through things. It was enough to notice. Which to me is very unprofessional, for a company this big. When compared to the killer effects and art doesn't make much sense.This captures, the same good aspects and added new improvements.THE MUSIC ROCKED!!! Typical ""Disney music"" was mostly mellow and of the same style , but no more!. In the film, the music set the scene and matched with the time period! JAZZ! Catchy and still had the same great Disney lyrics.My girlfriend REALLY enjoyed it.

172,envity1981,"A good version of the ""Princess and the Frog"" tale",8,2 January 2014,"When I saw the trailer for the first time, I've always wanted to watch this movie. Unfortunately, I never had time and money to see it in a movie theatre. Now I've finally watched it on the internet, and I like it. After many 3D animation movies like the Toy Story series or ""non-cartoon"" TV series like the ""Hannah Montana"", I think it was really time for Disney to go back to basics. Until ""Princess and the Frog"", it had been a long time since Disney released old fashioned cartoon movies like ""Arielle"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"".I wondered for a long time why Disney stopped making cartoon musicals with beautiful songs to sing along with. Many recent Disney movies have very few or no songs at all. So, what happened to Disney? Perhaps, we'll never know.But fortunately, ""Princess and the Frog"" does have a lot of music, and a very charming story to tell. It surely might be good to know about black people's lives before racism was officially outlawed but it's not a must in order to understand the entire story. There are very few hints at racism. I can think of only two scenes which might refer to it.WARNING: SPOILERS!For example, you might wonder who outbid Tiana after she actually had got enough money to afford that old dump. Did anyone outbid her at all? If yes, then how could she buy that dump after all, if that building had already been sold to someone else? Or were those two white men being racist to her?Another hint at racism which I can think of might be a very short scene where Tiana takes a seat in a back row. That scene reminds me of the civil rights activist Rosa Parks. Sitting in a bus, Miss Parks refused to give up her seat in the ""colored"" section to a white passenger after the ""white"" section was filled (see the Wikipedia article on Rosa Parks).",The Princess and the Frog
173,cruztacean,Tiana was likable and real,7,13 May 2010,"I'm not giving this the highest rating, but I wanted to say I was very pleased with Tiana herself. Of all the Disney princesses, she is the one with whom I would most like to be friends, if she were a real person.First of all, Anika Noni Rose is one TREMENDOUS singer! Her vocal performance on ""Almost There,"" if nothing else, makes the film worth watching. Besides this, the work ethic instilled is a breath of fresh air. Tiana isn't a mere decoration of a princess such as Aurora or Snow White, isolated from society while waiting for her prince to come and rescue her, nor is she a helpless victim like Cinderella. She has her many adversities, but she keeps her attitude positive and works toward her own goal. Unlike others who only happen to have been born into favorable circumstances, this Disney character actually *earned* her right to be called ""princess."" Not by defying authority (Ariel) or running away (Jasmine) but by good old fashioned hard work.Christians who are offended at the voodoo and the ""Shadow Man"" character are missing out on a few things: Naveen and Lawrence turned to the dark side for help, found themselves in serious trouble, and could only be rescued by guidance from a star called Evangeline, which means ""bringer of good news."" The word ""evangelist"" comes from the same root, and it cannot be coincidence that this name was chosen for the star. Wasn't Evangeline herself reminiscent of a cross? I think there is an excellent opportunity here to use the story to teach children about their Savior.As for racism, I didn't see any, but I'll admit that not being of that race, I am not qualified to speak with authority, which is why I'm glossing over the question of racism. However, sexism is another issue- -and wonderfully, I see none except where it would be expected: the snide remarks from the real estate agents, when talking to a woman in the 1920's who is as independent and self-reliant as Tiana. If there is any racism there (""a woman of your station"") then it would also be expected in that context. More importantly, though, did Tiana let it stop her from achieving her dreams? No. And neither should anyone else.The film was criticized for killing off a character, but then so did The Lion King. Ray's funeral was touching, and his family's joy at seeing him now joined with Evangeline was absolutely heart-warming. Again a potential Christian application here: when we die, it isn't the end.Another lesson, and an important one for young girls: Who got the prince? The one who wasn't looking for one, who was perfectly set to make her own dreams come true. Who got left out? The spoiled rich girl waiting passively for the prince.If I have a criticism, it's that even for someone who once lived in Southern Louisiana myself, I found the Cajun accents a bit too thick sometimes to follow.",The Princess and the Frog
174,mecassid,A Beautiful and Magical Film,10,22 December 2009,"It was so pleasant to watch a well animated feature. I enjoy the Disney 3D presentations, like Up, and other computer animated movies like Toy Story, but for years, I have missed old fashioned animation. This was a beautiful and magical film. The faces of the characters were rich and expressive, the characterization was well thought out, and the scenery was lush and precise for both the location and time period.The character of Tiana could have been a flat ""Cinderella"" type character who works all day hoping for a man to save her. Instead, she is a wonderfully modern princess—a passionate, intelligent, creative woman who is concerned with fulfilling her dreams through work and learns that having a career doesn't mean she has to miss out on having love and a family. Charlotte could have become a flat ""Ugly Stepsister"" type who vies for Naveen's affections and cares more about money than people. Instead, while she is ditzy and cares about finding true love, Charlotte also cares about friendship, and offers to help Naveen and Tiana when the time comes. Naveen could have been an empty ""Prince Charming"" who the viewer never really gets to see, let alone know. Instead, we watch his slow transformation from a narcissistic playboy to a caring self-sacrificing man. I have been to New Orleans 3 times, and loved the music and scenery the film provided. Viewers see the rich Creoles, those who live at the heart of the city, the more indigent African American and Caucasian families living outside of the city, and the Cajun culture of the bayou. Each scene was painstakingly created, and the effort shows. The film could not have been set anywhere else. The setting is integral to the film.As an adult, I loved this movie. The only thing that parents might object to their children seeing are the scenes involving voodoo. For a young child, the Shadow Man could be quite scary, particularly a scene in a grave yard where he tries to capture the Frog Prince. People with strong religious views might also be offended by the scenes with Mama Odie. However, I would urge modern viewers to think of these scenes in terms of the fairytale construct—they are meant to be seen in terms like the Evil Queen of Snow White, who also used magic, or like Ursula of the Little Mermaid, who was also trying to take someone's soul. Similarly, this film doesn't present the Shadow Man and Mama Odie in terms of religion, but in terms of magic. They could very easily have been an Evil Stepfather and a Fairy Godmother.Overall, I thought that The Princess and the Frog was a fantastic film. The songs were jazzy and had shades of Gershwin, the scenery was beautiful and varied, the characters were well thought out, and the plot had enough twists and turns to keep me interested. I haven't enjoyed an animated film so much since Beauty and the Beast came out in 1991.",The Princess and the Frog
175,mtl429,Too much filler,6,25 April 2018,"I liked the scenery through most of the movie. It was nice to see the classic hand drawn Disney movie vs the computer drawn we rely on now. Main problem was the story was a bit too much, and you couldn't really relate to the characters. Another thing I noticed was how forgettable the villain was in this movie. Hell, I just watched it and feel I need to google the villain's name again. I rate it a 6 because it's worth watching again in a few years, but no major Wow factor.",The Princess and the Frog
176,Excalibur12ny,"And with the brilliant light of Cajun Fireflies, there is a ray of hope in the world ...",10,12 December 2009,"As a young female twenty-something, my 90's childhood was shaped by the Golden Age of Disney. Every year, there would be a new masterpiece for my mom to take me to; Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Aladdin ... And when Disney failed so terribly in the early millennium and closed down shop, my heart was broken. There was a part of our culture and my life that my little girl I someday hope to have was never going to be able to experience, and I was never going to get back.So as soon as I heard that Disney was coming out with their triumphant return to 2-D, I felt like the world was FINALLY getting its act together.While CGI has produced some good hits, it isn't the same as 2-D. There was no one who could do cartoons like Disney, and I think they began to realize that.I can honestly say that this movie is brilliant. I saw it last night, and it's still haunting me twenty-four hours later like I'd just walked out of the theater. If this movie had been A.) racist or B.) a let down, I would have been very angry and wouldn't take the time to write out this review. But my God, it was right up there alongside ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King."" Tiana, the long-awaited princess of the film, is a (gasp) real person! Her whole life does not revolve around getting married to the prince, nor does it involve some odd and harried ""I'm totally a hardkore awesome person"" plot. She has her faults. She's brash, a workaholic, and kind of a judgmental jerk. However, she is also headstrong, loving, and ridiculously intuitive. This is the sort of woman we need in a Disney cartoon for our kids to look up to, especially when the best role model they've had in the past few years is Bella Swann.The prince, Naveen, is also an actual human being. He's cocky, spoiled, and hilarious. However, as the movie goes on, it is made quite clear (in a song by Randy Newman) that Naveen isn't happy at all. His and Tiana's relationship is based on self-discovery and mutual respect, rather than some of the other Disney movies where it is completely based on the need for a romantic plot. I see Belle and the Beast and Shang and Mulan (pre Mulan II, we can pretend that sequel doesn't exist), rather than Cinderella and Prince Charming. It seems like ""Enchanted"" really did bring a lot of new ideas to the Disney creed, and it completely shows in the way they tackle their archetypes in this refreshing rendition.I was skeptical when I heard Randy Newman had composed the music. And yes, folks, it is in fact musical style. The characters sing, not Randy. And while you can still tell it's Randy, it's also Disney. The jazzy complexity of the songs drive the story forward and just wrap you up into the buzzing momentum of the film. I will definitely grab this soundtrack and play it religiously on my ipod, I promise you that.As for the racism: It's Disney and regardless of what Disney does, someone is going to find something to point out as racist. However, let me just say that this movie is completely respectful and absolutely nothing in it is racist, to the point where it is obvious that Disney is trying their hardest NOT to be racist and cuts corners on the storytelling and historical racism that WOULD have been in New Orleans in 1920 (and to an extent, yes, still is). And as for turning Tiana into a frog ... she's a human for a good half the movie before she even thinks about kissing Naveen. She's a black princess, she's not a frog princess.I also saw a comment about how someone didn't like it because of the non-Christian message thanks to the use of voodoo? They were so busy looking at the BAD GUY use voodoo that they didn't realize that Terrence Howard's character was pretty much a walking sermon! ""You can wish on a star, but that can only take you halfway?"" Where does this sound familiar? ""Never lose sight of what's most important ... love."" My God, the complete non-Christian message is abhorrent! The star is used as an allegory for God, and they wish on it with their hands folded ... practically one could say praying? And let's not even go into the full moral of the story: ""You know what you want, but dig a little deeper and find what you need."" How about that whole thanking God for unanswered prayers sort of ideal? These are good and wholesome lessons that are going to really strengthen the next generation of both boys and girls, and I'm happy that it's going to be an influence on the younger generation.And the writing is amazing. As someone who writes for a living, I was completely floored at the structure of this film. You cover so much ground in 90 minutes, and you are never bored nor know what's going to happen next! Disney knows what they're doing (finally) on this film. It's amazingly put together, and all the trademarks you expect to see (animal sidekicks, creepy awesome villain, amazing soundtrack, knockout visuals, strong heroine) are there in full. Go see this movie, and remember how it was to be a kid again. This is an experience you absolutely need to have.""Princess and the Frog"" is here to stay.",The Princess and the Frog
177,Alncr,"The Last 2D Disney Movie That Goes Beyond ""Disney""",9,21 August 2019,"Being next to the 10th anniversary of this film now in mid-2019, I was finally encouraged enough to completely revisit it as I definitely remember seeing it in theaters back at the very, Very end of the last decade. And, it is still as meaningful and at times quite emotional as it was for me 10 years ago. Even more now, because the morality of this world is dying faster than ever before.Unfortunately for Disney also, this turned out to be their last (or next to last) 2D theatrical film, which pained me even more coming back to this movie now, because it's a shame that they've really turned for the worst with all the live action remakes of their classics they've been bringing out as of late. Not only that, but also, starting to dive into PC like most of Hollywood has now (which is even worse).Though, I could honestly care less about this having been the first ""black"" 2D Disney movie as I love that the message and morals of this movie go far. Far beyond any of that.P.S. The only crazy thing I have to say about this film is that there's a bunch of heartfelt emotion crammed into the last 20 minutes (up to the film's reprise of the title song), that it's always hard for me to not shed at least 1 tear here starting from when a heartbroken Tiana says that piercing reality quote to Ray that essentially defies all 'Disney Logic'.Also, some scenes here and there felt a bit rushed. But nothing out of ordinary with these type of Disney films.",The Princess and the Frog
178,Ninetails1991,"Good, but due to the times, not great.",7,14 April 2010,"Just today, I have seen the movie The Princess and the Frog. Here's what I thought of it...P.A.T.F. was a mildly charming movie, although little chick-flick-ish, and had a impressing storyline. What if the most magical kiss in the world... backfired? That's right, the main character, after kissing a frog (who is really a prince), turns into one herself. Now, the hard-working Tiana and the laid-back Prince Naveen (odd name...) must go on a magical journey- blah, blah, blah...Good points for the movie: This was made using the same technique as most of Disney's classics. Cute characters (Except for one trumpet... playing... gator...) Interesting story And a great villain to tie it all together!Bad points for the movie: Political correctness kind of ruined it... If it wasn't for it... It has a gator playing a trumpet. A TRUMPET!!! The main character's best friend is a blond-haired ditsy débutante... Need I say more about her?Total score: 7/10. It was charming, but if it wasn't for the timing in which the movie was made, it'd be a classic. But, now, it's just another starry-eyed movie.",The Princess and the Frog
179,sampsoninc916,Been waiting for this for years! Now it has arrived!,10,12 December 2009,"Every nerd out there in Internet land is basically a fan of animation. I am one of those nerds. Basically, the nerd kingdom has been expecting this movie, now, it has arrived. To fully understand the premises, let's rewind back to 2001, Shrek arrived, pushed boundaries of computer animation, and made fairy tales awesome again. It followed up with a very successful sequel, but other animation studios misunderstood that the Shrek formula was the only way to make animated movies. So they made formulaic CGI movies, and Disney tried to jump on as well, but still, with every hard stone, there is a soft part to it. Back in late 2005/early 2006, I read that Disney acquired Pixar, John Lasseter became Chief Creative Executive, and that Disney was going to make The Princess and the Frog a 2-D animated musical. I nearly crapped in my pants, it was a dream come true. I wanted modern audiences to see the awesome force of actual animation on the big screen, and maybe then people would take it more seriously. However, through all the delays, formulaic CGI, dumb teeny bopper shows on Disney Channel, and an unworthy minority flick called the Alvin and the Chipmunks remake, I had to wait for nearly 4 years for this movie to see the light of day, in 2009. In between all that, I managed to get my fix with Disney's Enchanted, a good movie about a princess winding up in Manhattan, but the highlight was the animated sequences and the musical numbers. Pretty well written. It was a great tribute, but not nearly as awesome as the phenomenon that we were going to see next.July 30, 2008 - First teaser trailer premieres, watched it, not much from a teaser, but enough to get me pumped up.May 7-10, 2009 - Second trailer premieres, well worth the wait, highlights Disney classics at the start, gives us a good taste, one of the best trailers ever made.July 2009 - Another trailer premieres, this time highlighting the songs, thought the whole ""Blue Skies and Sunshine"" number was just going to be Percy's theme from Thomas the Tank Engine set to lyrics. Questioned some of the humor in there, too.November 2009 - Marketing campaign is well underway. More trailers, TV spots, a Youtube channel, a Facebook page, movie stand up posters, bus stop posters, internet ads, featurettes on the Disney Channel, a featurette called Dreams Come True: A Celebration of Disney Animation, a MSNBC spot, an ABC news spot, an Access Hollywood Spot, sneak peeks on other channels, books, gummy snacks, dolls, games, toys, right down to the clothing. All that's missing is a Happy Meal promotion.December 11, 2009 - The movie finally premieres.Pretty much saw it today, and to my surprise, the theater was pretty full. Not every seat was occupied, but still full. Trailers: Toy Story 3, The Last Song from Touchstone Pictures, starring Miley Cyrus (has she annoyed me enough already!), Disney's Oceans, and Tooth Fairy (why can't The Rock stick to wrestling?). I guess Disney was brainwashing the audience with terrible trailers to make the movie look bad. Folks, I'm going to tell you something. No matter what the world assaults on us, and how it brings us down, there will always exist the force of love. I think that is what The Princess and the Frog is, a labor of love from the studio who made a mistake and came back doing good, Disney. Everything about the movie delighted me. The visuals, the score, the songs, the voices, the color, and the scripting, it was all there. I seemed to be worried that the humor would be crude. It wasn't. It was more of a Three Stooges type humor, and even so, in the trailer, Ray battling swamp dudes is hilarious and delightful, even if it does involve mucus. Very touching, very colorful, very amazing, what a great flick. My favorite number was Almost There, see the movie for yourself to find out why. Well worth the popcorn and the money, since I went to see this with my Mom, my sister, and a friend. It cost $33.90 for all of us, but the money was well paid. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2009.Also, Princess Tiana as a frog is one of the cutest things I've ever seen. She looks very delightful when she smiles as a frog. Also, again, the humor wasn't very stupid, it was a tiny bit stupid, but it was good and delightful enough to save Mr. Disney's grace. Also, I found out that Walt Disney Animation Studios was founded in 1934 to begin production on Snow White, and since The Princess and the Frog was released in 2009, 75 years after Snow White began production, it's fair to say that for the occasion, Disney decided to cut to bull-hooey. Even they're thinking about doing more films like this in the future, such as Rapunzel, King of the Elves, and the coupe de gras, The Snow Queen.Walt Disney seems to be smiling up in heaven.",The Princess and the Frog
180,maskingtape411,Disney is back!,10,9 January 2010,"The new 2d animated film by Disney is fantastic! Going back to the old fashioned way of animation with characters, music and a story was the way to go. Being filled with all these CG films was a little uncomfortable but Pixar and Dreamworks are the superior ones. What we have here is a wonderful old fashioned Disney film which will entertain the kids and the adults with its superb story, plot, and characters instead of unnecessary pop culture references and off topic topics.The film tells the classic fairy tale in a whole new version set in 1920's New Orleans. A young African-American woman named Tiana dreams of opening her own restaurant because of her delicious family recipes most notably the gumbo. She has therefore working very hard day and night to save the money necessary to buy an estate. Meanwhile her hyperactive white friend Charlotte is throwing a big party where she will ask Prince Naveen her hand in marriage. Prince Naveen is an attractive musician from overseas looking forward to the marriage.Mean while the villain of the film Dr. Facillier promises him major wealth along with the marriage by giving him ""greens"". This eventually ends up Facillier using black magic turning Naveen into a frog while his slave driven assistant is transformed into Naveen for a better life.Tiana comes across the talking frog and very reluctantly kisses him only ending up turning her into a frog. They must then find a way to turn back.What's really enjoyable are the times the two frogs come across characters involving a trumpet-playing alligator, a hillbilly firefly, and a blind voodoo woman. They are all very well developed and acted giving us bold feelings for them. Even the assistant with muttonchops is a key character who wishes to destroy Naveen and have himself become Naveen for that better life (sort of life identity theft). At other times the two frogs are getting to know each other very well while coming across conflicts involving shadow monsters from the villain and hillbillies hunting frogs for their legs.The musical numbers were very fun to listen to thanks to Randy Newman. There's a number about what the alligator and the two frogs want to do when they turn back (""When we're human""), numbers explaining the characters and overall they are fun and memorable.The plot that plays out is engaging to make the audience hope they turn back into humans. Conflict settles when the villain tells Tiana he can turn her back into human giving her that restaurant she wanted but feels sorry for Naveen who is still that frog. Eventually she's happy being that frog and destroys Dr. Facillier. Naveen also accepts being a frog after failing to kiss Charlotte (princess of the king of a big company by the way) before midnight. They marry, they kiss, and they turn back into humans since Tiana became a princess and Prince Naveen was technically a prince.It's what everyone expects, good guys win, bad guys lose but the plot that plays out makes the audience hope for the best while conflict settles.This film was the phoenix rising from the ashes of my childhood, appreciating everything Disney had to offer with their traditional animation and storytelling. The characters were superb, the music was wonderful, and the altered story of the classic fairy tale was well told. This film is a definite see for parents with children and even adults without children; they'll enjoy it too.",The Princess and the Frog
181,soundman2000,Disney is outright lying to children world wide!,1,12 December 2009,I commented on this before but I feel the need to go into further detail.1. The title of the film is Princess and the Frog. A tale about an African American girl who wants to be a princess and find and marry a prince. >_> well thats what Disney says in the commercial but thats an outright lie! 2. The only person in the film that wants the princess dream is the rich white girl who is the friend of Tiana the poor African-American girl living in a tiny shack. All Tiana wants is to actually open a restaurant NOT be a princess. So I don't know why this is called princess and the frog. (should be The poor girl and the frog) 3. Tiana spends maybe 10-15 mins max as a human and the rest as a frog. (Does Disney have a problem with showing African-Americans in there films or something?) 4. Finally this movie had 1 big thing that Disney should not have added. TOO MUCH RACISM! If you want to know what i'm talking about go watch this piece of crap and see what i'm talking about.,The Princess and the Frog
182,sa-178,A refreshing change from CGI,7,11 December 2009,"This animated feature offers a refreshing change to all the ""too perfect, too seamless"" CGI cartoons we've had for the past couple of years. There comes a point when the mind becomes overwhelmed by all these high tech stuff.Which is why ""Princess and Frog"" is a breath of fresh air to a lot of people, including myself. It's like going back to the old-school days of ""Snow White"", ""Bambi"", ""101"", ""Beauty"", ""Aladdin"" and even ""Lion King"", when artistry with the pencil is valued.And the characters! What a fun loving bunch indeed. Louis the Crocodile reminds me of Baloo of ""Jungle Book"".

183,gpoliti12,At last,9,20 August 2015,"I've been watching Disney since I was a little girl. Now I'm in my mid- twenties and have to confess that I've become a little disappointed in what Disney has become lately. I've been waiting for a Disney comeback for ages. Soon after everything became 3D it seemed like most movie from now on would be so much less interesting and so much less original that it was before. And then when Princess and the Frog came out I was a little hesitant as to how it would work in 3D, how original it would be and I had a big fear. How they would handle Tiana and the rest of the characters being the first black cast in a Disney movie, which in the end was handled greatly. To my surprise when I started watching the movie I remember jumping off of my chair when I realized that the movie is in 2D. I immediately became excited and couldn't wait to see it. The plot is a classic princess fairytale with a spin that we've never seen before...The princess actually having dreams and ambitions about opening a restaurant unlike the rest of the princesses (except from Mulan) that they were all about finding prince charming. That I find a very good improvement to classic Disney stories. The characters are quirky, unique and funny .Charlotte made me laugh out loud a number of times. Ray was way beyond funny. Louis was a delight to watch throughout the entire movie. The one character that I had a small problem with was actually Tiana. Even though she was ambitious and strong that was kind of vague during the movie. I wish she was a bit more firm. The music is my main focus which is actually if not the best, one of the best soundtracks Disney has ever seen. Its refreshing, its passionate, it makes you want to dance and mostly it makes you feel joy. Overall this movie was a great one. Very, very underrated and doesn't even match its ratings. Its so much better than I thought it would be and I'd watch it a million times more. Good job Disney. I'd suggest less movies like Frozen and more movies like this one.",The Princess and the Frog
184,adrews,Not for 4-year-olds,5,12 December 2009,"I mostly agree with diaclaybo22's comments, except that I loved the music and that's what warranted five stars from me. Aside from that, the story was all over the place, and much of the movie was too busy, perhaps trying to figure out where it was going. My four-year-old daughter, who loves Disney ""princess"" movies like Little Mermaid, Snow White, Cinderella, and Aladdin, was frightened by the demon shadows and the alligator scene (before Louis reveals his gentler side). Maybe four- year-old girls aren't the target audience, but the scary scenes from other ""princess"" movies have been much tamer and shorter lived than what was in this movie, and none of them have ever been too scary for my daughter. Those scenes were very in-your-face and LOUD (but that might have been particular to the venue where I saw it, the Ziegfeld theater in NYC).Anyway, just wanted to get that out there since there are so many comments praising this film and awarding it 10 stars (really? 10 stars for a mediocre cartoon? I can see giving an animated film like Wall-E a 10, but Wall-E makes Princess/Frog look like hackery.)",The Princess and the Frog

186,Cyck1,Best post-Renaissance Disney film. Without a Doubt,8,26 June 2010,"The first time I saw a trailer to this film about 2 years ago I just knew that it would be different... or, at the least, be better then what Disney has been giving us post-Hunchback of Notre Dame. I'm so glad my hunch was right.As the intro song ""Down in New Orleans"" cues up 5 minutes into the film you KNOW that Disney means business this time. The sky shots of a mid-1920's News Orleans is colorful and completely convincing. The CGI effects on the cars and buses blend in rather then stand out and the animation is just stunning. The people move with thick, fluid rhythm that actually sells the Jazz vibe better then the music itself. The first 15 minutes of this film is more captivating then the last 4 years of Disney's Animated Studios' efforts. I kid you not. It'll have your full attention.Then, we have the characters. The lead ""Princess"" here is Tiana; a young, over-worked African American who struggles to make her late Dad's dreams of owning a restaurant come true. She's a very interesting character. While the typical Disney Princess tends to have her head in the clouds with sweeping and romantic fantasias of a better life, Tiana is decisively realistic. She is level-headed and unrelenting in bringing her goals to pass.... which actually proves to be a kind of character flaw. Needless to say, I like her.I have heard numerous times that Prince Naveen (Tiana's ""Prince Charming"") is a very flat and uninteresting character. My response to that is to consider what Disney usually gives us in the way of Princes. Even in their best films the Prince is 1-dimensional. At least Naveen has a bit of depth to him. He's a charismatic playboy and.... okay, maybe not a HUGE amount of depth here but he's still far more fleshed-out then the Prince tends to be and he made me laugh.The side-characters were, for the most part, well-done. The gator Louis came dangerously close to being annoying but he manages to keep just the right amount of distance from the plot to not be a bother. Ray was awesome, I can write a whole essay on Tiana's hilarious friend ""Lottie"" (by far my favorite character) and the charismatic Dr. Facilier is going to go down in history as one of the best Disney Villain's ever. Not an easy list to make.Now we get to the music as well as the reason why Princess and The Frog only gets an 8 out of 10 from me. To be fair none of the songs are ""bad"". Just extremely forgettable. The only song that you'll remember in full detail is Facilier's irresponsibly awesome ""Friends on the Other Side"". The rest all sound good as the movie proceeds but it just doesn't have the charm or the power of, say, Aladdin or Little Mermaid. I consider this a very big deal if we're talking Disney. The songs are what gave the Renaissance flicks their timeless factor. Randy Newman just hasn't reached that level with this film's soundtrack.The plot isn't brilliant but it is effective and its messages are very well conveyed. Tiana and Naveen are both put under a spell that makes them frogs until they both come to realize that is isn't what we want that matters in life as much as what we need. It was their ""wants"" that drove them to frog-hood in the first place and the road to recovered humanity will bring them face-to-face with that fact.The other theme in this film is that BOTH hard work and belief accomplish dreams. Not one of these components, but both. This theme recurs constantly... through song, symbolism, and even the strange love interest of one of the side-characters. The plot is deeply entrenched in the film's higher themes in so many ways that you may not catch every single bit on your first watch (HINT: pay close attention to the ""Friends on The Other Side"" scene).The film also does this neat little perspective trick where the camera takes a first-person view of a scene. It happens once in the awesome Neon-skull Shadow Man scene and a second more subtle time when Tiana is talking to Lottie and her Father. Its a very small part of the film but its effects are definitely felt. Love it.The bottom line is that The Princess and The Frog is a must-watch for anyone who is losing faith in Disney's competence. The animation is top-notch, the effects are spell-binding, the characters are fun and the plot has more then a little heart. Its no Lion King to be sure but it does deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as some of the studios best efforts.",The Princess and the Frog
187,anoya-c,Excellent!!,10,7 February 2012,"I felt like a little kid again seeing The Princess and the Frog; apparently so did most of the theater, as the crowd seemed to be generally from 8-30 years old. From the second I walked in, I realized this was a movie that was going to span groups(and it did, in the end). The other adults in line with me split almost evenly with tickets for this versus Invictus.The animation is gorgeous, the characters are absolutely unique and took me by surprise, and even the parts in trailers that I thought were going to be awful turned out to be brilliant when put into the context of the rest of the film. I haven't enjoyed Disney this much since Mulan(and vaguely, Brother Bear). The music also seems to permeate the movie; many people that review and find something wrong, find so much song and dance to be odd- but what they don't realize is that the movie itself was always intending to play off of the Jazz era it is set in. If you love music, however, you'll love this even more. The music is what gives all the more charm to it, and it pays off.The only reason that I am giving this a nine of ten is because I try to never give movies a ten unless it literally changed my life somehow. This came close, though- I was having so many flashbacks to my childhood during the Disney Renaissance. It was nostalgic for me, above all, and classic Disney animation that I will probably end up spending more money on when such moments roll around. I am most certainly going to find the soundtrack, because the music just made it so alive.",The Princess and the Frog
188,polyvinylchloride,Disney's return,10,20 April 2013,"After so many years Disney finally got it right again. ""The Princess and the Frog"" is right up there with the likes of ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King"". It may start a little slowly but turns great once Tiana and Naveen get to the swamp. Both are very well-developed characters with Tiana being a great role model. Judging by the trailers I thought Ray the firefly would annoy me but he's actually the most likable character in the movie. The story contains lots of comedy and a heart-warming message. Dr. Facilier is an awesome villain and I wonder if Disney is going to give him further appearances. The songs are catchy and fun with amazing visuals. The traditional animation is basically eye candy. I hope Disney doesn't leave this path.",The Princess and the Frog
189,overmood,Nostalgic and progressive at the same time,8,18 January 2010,"After a long hiatus, Disney is back in the hand-drawn 2D medium and it doesn't disappoint. The Princess and The Frog is another take on the genre of fairy tales in a typical Disney style.The movie, which is based on the variation of The Frog Princess tale, adds twists to the original story, making changes in the location, the characters, as well as the incidents that take place. These variations added some originality to the story and allowed the smooth insertion of some typical Disney elements.Early in the movie, a comparison is drawn between Tiana, an African- American, who works hard to fulfill her late father's dream of having a restaurant, and her friend Charlotte, who lives with her rich father a relaxing life. When Prince Naveen, Prince of Maldonia, comes to town after being disinherited by his parents due to his lifestyle, Charlotte expresses her wishes to marry him. Prince Naveen, who lost all his fortune and isn't ready for hard work, is lured by Dr. Facillier, an evil Dr. of voodoo. Dr. Facillier, who is looking to take Charlotte's father wealth, replaces Naveen by his valet and transforms the prince into a frog; a frog which needs a princess' kiss so as to be a man again.As far as the story goes, I find the Disney take on the classic tale very entertaining. As with most other Disney movies of the same genre, Tiana has her share of goofy friends, funny moments, and lovely adventures. Even the villain, Dr. Facillier, seems destined to take his place deservingly among Disney's most interesting villains -- I think he should have taken a greater role, though.It would be unfair, however, to compare this movie to Disney classics like The Little Mermaid and The Lion King. It surely follows the same movie making philosophy, but is not as powerful as these classics. But I think this is due to the excellence of these classics, rather than any downside in this movie. This is also evident in the soundtrack, which is very good, but not to be compared with Disney's previous soundtracks -- especially in the two mentioned classics.The Princess and the Frog brings a nostalgic feeling for all those who were anticipating Disney's departure from the cheap sequels business. It follows a legacy of more than 60 years of film making and it certainly shows that the decision to stop developing 2D movies was a bad one.A revisit to the concepts of good vs. evil, hard work vs. laziness, love, and friendships, this movie will sure appeal to kids and adults alike, Even if the movie doesn't fair impressively in the box-office, it will hopefully bring back to life a medium that many people thought was all but dead.",The Princess and the Frog
190,sherwelthlangley,Disney successfully brings back the old classical vernacular,8,4 January 2010,"Whether or not Princess and the Frog can touch off another Disney Renaissance remains to be seen, but this film successfully captures the vernacular that made Disney animation once so great. I heard someone criticize the film for having a plot too much like 'Snow White' and 'Cinderella', but from my observations, that is not the case. While there is a consistency of the 'wish upon a star/dreams' motif throughout these princess films, Tiana carries a very down-to-earth personality that contrasts with the dreamy sweetness that Cinderella and Aurora had. Only Mulan matches Tiana's ferocity. As I referred to above, the Disney ""vernacular"" is very much alive in this film, from the themes, character portrayal, dialog, and music. The roles are very much in line with the traditional classics, where you have your fair share of witty and whimsical characters, whose jokes, explicit and nuanced, are guaranteed to make you chuckle. The way Louis, Ray, and the Shadow Man act will bring back memories of Timon, Pumba, Jafar, Iago, and much more. The music is outstanding. Randy Newman, who replaces the venerable Alan Menken (Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast), does a quality job of incorporating jazz, blues, gospel, African, and more into a quintessential Disney musical. As an avid jazz musician and listener, Newman's work accurately and eclectically captures the music of early 20th century New Orleans. While he is not as creative a lyricist as Tim Rice or Howard Ashman, Newman successfully had me tapping my feet to many of the tunes played in the bayou. What's keeping me from giving a full 10 is a relative inconsistency in the plot. There are a few plot holes, not all of which are explicitly evident, but the movie was a tad rushed, so the plot is a little bumpy. However, the charm of the film is very much in line with its predecessors, so we're not exactly expecting Godfather IV here. Overall, Disney does a terrific job and I laud the decision to bring John Lasseter on as producer. His choice to have John Musker and Ron Clements (Aladdin, Little Mermaid) direct the film was a wise one, and I hope to see more 2D animated classics from them in the future.",The Princess and the Frog
191,kristipetersen,Disney's Triumphant Return to 2-D,10,26 November 2009,"I was privileged to attend a showing of The Princess and the Frog last night as part of a special engagement at New York City's Zeigfeld theater. This movie exceeded all expectations. It is visually stunning, musically a work of genius, thematically sophisticated, and story-wise told in a refreshingly different way (some actions are pre-motivation) which makes the ride an unpredictable one. Visually, Disney has gone above and beyond. They have invoked the steamy feeling of the city of New Orleans in shades of gold and lavender, and in the swamp scenes, some of the backgrounds are so expertly rendered it's like you're looking at a photograph. But what stood out the most with this artwork was the colors. They are a study in thematic contrast. In the scenes with the villain, the bright colors of Mardi Gras are used to reveal a darker, sinister side. The effect is wonderfully jarring and creates an appropriate emotional response: rather than hating the villain, we're led to mistrust him. He's pretty on the outside, but there's something awful lurking underneath. It's like that sixth sense you get sometimes with certain people in your life. In Mama Odie's scene, the color scheme is subtle and muted—until she reveals her inner goodness, and the scene explodes with color; another comment on how purity can hide in the most surprising places. To say that once again Randy Newman has done an expert job with the music would be an understatement. He had a lot to work with here—the musical tapestry of New Orleans is a mix of Dixieland, Zydeco, and Spiritual. He could have easily chosen one of those styles and stuck with it—instead, he blends all three, and the effect is seamless. The musical numbers tend to stay in one vein or the other depending on the character – which also works to help tell the story -- but the underlying score, while you'll instantly recognize Newman's hallmark sound, is a genius integration. To top it off, because this film takes place in the golden age of jazz, he has deftly inserted musical references to Gershwin. Amazing. With so much to work with, it could have easily been a confusing or even chaotic train-wreck. Not in his hands.Thematically, this film has taken some of Disney's classic themes and examined them more deeply: they are two-sided and complex. The choices these characters make are never easy--more so than in other films--and that updates these themes so that modern audiences can more readily identify. Similarly, Disney's newest princess, Tiana, is the strongest, most interesting princess to date. She is intelligent, complex – and oozes passion, something that, in my opinion, has only been approached (and I do insist, ""approached"") in Belle and Ariel. Tiana is a princess for today's woman. Little girls of the world have quite an exciting and refreshing new role model. Disney's writers have chosen to tell this story in a different way, as well. It's not your typical spell-it-all-out up-front story, and some story elements are never even vocalized, they're visual, and back story and motivation are sometimes revealed after the relevant action rather than before. It was really refreshing to see Disney choose a slightly different construction—it leads to keeping the tale unpredictable and much more engaging. But I'm a writer, so I know it's hard to do this well. For the most part, Disney succeeds. However, there is a bit of a downside to this. Constructing a story in this manner can lead to a lot of subtlety in the way the story is told, and because of this, some of the characters' motives are not always clear right away. This seems to happen the most with Dr. Facilier, the villain. When he's on the screen, it's really important to concentrate or you might miss some key story elements.All in all, don't miss The Princess and the Frog. It's the best 97 minutes I've spent in a theater in a long, long time.",The Princess and the Frog

193,timeaftrtime,A welcome return to old-school Disney,7,12 December 2009,"I've been awaiting this movie for quite awhile. After that long-ago announcement that Disney was done with the hand-drawn stuff a release like this is certainly exciting. And while I'm a fan of the Pixar gems, hand-drawn animation has a quality hard to match. Not only that, but the popularity of ""Enchanted"" suggested that maybe Disney fans are nostalgic for the traditional fairy tale story line and Broadway-style music.That being said, this is not quite at the level of ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King"" in either scope or emotion. I realize that is a fine balance to walk for fear of becoming cheesy, but it seems that no one in this really felt anything to any strong degree. Oh, there were emotions and they were fair, but I think a little more passion in the characters could have given this story the ""dash of Tabasco sauce"" it needed for real kick. And there was plenty of fodder for emotions. Our new princess Tiana is a workaholic hell-bent on opening her own restaurant against all odds. Prince Naveen has been cut off by his royal family. Then they are both magically transformed into frogs. There is plenty to work with here. But instead we're left with a fun yet too-lighthearted romp through the bayou. Some scary intensity comes in due time, though, and, SPOILER, viewers should be warned there is a tragic character death that ironically is one of the movies sweetest moments. I just don't think it's fair that bit of great emotion stood fairly on its own.And then there are the songs. Oh, the songs. Don't get me wrong, I love a good Disney sing-along. But save for a few exceptions (notably the exquisite ""Ma Belle Evangeline"") they weren't much more than pleasant. Honestly, some of them were a bit cheesy with lyrics doing the character development jobs the plot and the characters themselves should have been doing. Now to the good stuff and the reasons for my 7/10. The animation is pretty. I think it's nice New Orleans gets a Disney tribute. I found it to be a good and imaginative plot. The villain did not get as much screen time as he deserved, and I mean this only as a compliment (and how could one not love his freaky little voodoo doll companions?) There's also the romance. Again, I wish there had been a little more to it, but I certainly appreciated what they had and perhaps that's the source of my craving for more emotion. I always love a good opposites-attract story, and who could be more badly matched than workaholic Tiana and spoiled playboy Naveen? They truly had some adorable moments. They are fantastic, lovable characters. In fact, the movie doesn't have a single character I found a waste of an animator. Disney knows its heroines and heroes and sidekicks, and here they are done well.I also liked the way some of the more serious issues were handled. Yes, the story takes place in a rather awkward time and setting for a woman of color like Tiana. It's not thrown to the forefront of the story and much of the situation will be appreciated by only alert viewers. But, honestly, the one ""serious"" topic I noticed was the concept of money that might strike a chord with many in today's economy. Honestly, rich girl Charlotte seems to be the only one interested in love rather than money. Slapstick humor has also made a comeback. There is a lot of physical comedy here that will have kids and adults laughing. It fits well with the charming characters and soon becomes comfortable in the film.""The Princess and the Frog"" is a fine movie that should please audiences and resurrect a love for Disney's golden age. ""Beauty and the Beast"" it is not, but it can certainly hold its own magic and I for one welcome it with open arms.",The Princess and the Frog
194,colem11,One of the worst 5 movies I have ever seen.,1,26 December 2009,"-There aren't any likable characters-I hate Jazz music -I don't like the whole ""New Orleans glorification"" bit-the frogs were boring and lifeless -the Voodoo and evil in the movie was overwhelming for a movie rated G, and had no warning that my 3 year old was going to be frightened in her first movie experience.In a nutshell, this movie is a piece of garbage. I'd rather go to the dentist for 2 hours than watch this again. This movie has NONE of the charm expected of a Disney film. By placing such a large emphasis on Jazz, and New Orleans culture, the number of people who will like this movie is cut down to people who like Jazz, and New Orleans. Everyone else will be bored to tears.",The Princess and the Frog
195,Dreaming_Fairie,Wow.,10,23 December 2009,"I never intended to walk out of the theater liking this movie more than my younger brother himself. I figured it would just be another typical slap-stick animated movie. Boy, was I in for an unexpected treat.I was not expecting the characters to be so- well- unique. Each character has their own personality and goals that they want to pursue. The ""side"" characters are much more more active than the typical sidekicks we get from Disney animated films. Even the villain in this piece had his own unique personality that made him feel more like a real person than just your average villain. -The main protagonist's chemistry blew me out the window. It was so well-done! Although they tend to fall in love within the matter of three days, their relationship is still developed wonderfully. Both Tiana and Naveen are missing something in their lives. They both bring that something to the table for each other that introduced what they needed. Unlike many other films that attempt the, ""hate first, love later"" type of deal, this one succeeds to the fullest extent. They are both humans with problems that have to save each other as they get themselves tied up into a mess of adventures. They get to know each other. They tease and bicker with each other, yet you can see how close they are.-The music fits the movie perfectly. Imagine if ""A Whole New World"" was slapped right in the middle of it all. It just wouldn't work. No need to force ballads into the picture when they are unneeded. The music, instead of pausing the film for 3 minutes as we listen to a song, moves the movie's plot forward. -The animation was STUNNING. It wasn't the typical 2D animated movies that were shown in the past. It seemed more 'complex'. The coloring was crisp and everything moved fluently. Although the story is not very complex or original, the way the film is put together makes it almost flawless. None of the scenes feel out of place. Each scene felt needed to progress the story. With the characters, amazing animation, and fast pace, this movie is one of the best I've seen all year.",The Princess and the Frog
196,tylasya,Beautiful but not epic.,9,23 December 2009,"This story certainly had some poetry in it. It was beautifully drawn with a touch of passion and soul. This movie was definitely worthwhile but not as epic than the lion king. The fact that its the first black main character is fine but.... why are most characters black or with an afro-American accent? I think we still have to wait for a movie with different coloured character (latino, Asians, blacks, white, red (hehe)) living together (in harmony). Thats how north America was made after all. the only down side was that the're was way too many songs, giving less time for showing the character's souls.",The Princess and the Frog
197,thomas-632-582454,Although Good Overall; Christian Parents be cautious...,7,17 January 2010,"In our family we are huge Disney fans and have always relied on the fact that if it's Disney, it's safe for our Kids (Ages 12, 6, and 1). The Princess in the Frog was a very entertaining movie and I was pleased to see them go back to the hand drawn animation with a musically based story line. One thing that was a little disturbing was the ""other side"" as depicted by the Shadow Man. The Shadow man is basically a voodoo witch doctor who makes a deal with the devil by turning a broke prince into a frog and his resentful assistant into a likeness of the prince. He accomplishes this by making a voodoo charm with some of the prince's blood after calling on ""his friends from the other side"" where he promises them plenty of souls if they help him get this fake prince married to the local rich girl so he can take the fathers money and control the town. There are a lot of dark, voodoo, demonic and satanic 'ish references. Being a Christian it made me a little uncomfortable that my six year old was taking this all in, and I was only comforted slightly at the end when the Shadow man goes to hell for his deeds. I am a pretty open minded Christian but I know plenty of other Christians who would not be happy about these demonic references. So Christian parents be warned you may want to think twice about buying this for your young-ones when it comes out on DVD.",The Princess and the Frog

200,roccos2,Instant Favorite,10,10 January 2013,"This is the Disney studio's return to 2D animation after a number of CG films that failed to deliver (""Chicken Little"", ""Meet the Robinsons"" and the underrated ""Bolt""). ""Frog"" is the company's best film since ""Tarzan"" in 1999. It's certainly more accomplished than any of the other classics released that decade. There were some decent stuff but none of them had that famous Disney quality to them. They were either too fluffy (""The Emperor's New Groove"", ""Lilo & Stitch""), too messy (""Atlantis"", ""Treasure Planet"") or just plain bland (""Brother Bear"", ""Home On The Range""). With ""Frog"", however, Disney is back on track. The film has some of the best artwork I've ever seen in 2D animation. The bayou and New Orleans are very well realized and the magic and spirit (no pun intended) of the city are wonderfully captured (notice the iron balconies). I feel like visiting there now after I've seen this movie. The music is top notch, even if it takes a little time to get used to. It's better than some of the 90's Disney hits (""Hercules"" comes to mind) and although Disney was hoping for a better performance at the box office, I hope there's still a chance we'll be seeing 2D stuff from the studio.",The Princess and the Frog
201,H3ddd,Started off well...,6,11 January 2010,"This movie was ""cute"" but I would definitely not put it into the same category as ""The Lion King"" or ""Beauty and the Beast."" My kids really got into the movie at the beginning (their ages are 11, 9 and 6) but started to lose interest about 30 minutes in. The 11 year old didn't really enjoy the movie at all. I would really recommend this movie for younger children (my 3 year old cousin LOVED it!) My mom thought the movie started out well but she lost interest also. She said the storyline of the movie sort of ""wandered off.""However, the jazz music was wonderful! The ""New Orleans"" feel and atmosphere were done exceptionally well, but I don't know how well this would impress a young child.H",The Princess and the Frog
202,littlehobbit13,"Not true classic-Disney, but certainly the best thing since!",9,11 December 2009,"9/10 - Go see it! It needs saying that I went into this movie with hesitant expectations. It's been a long time since the classic-Disney era, and they aren't doing so hot these days. I'm happy to say, I was beyond pleasantly surprised.The story is as follows: Tiana has always dreamed of opening her own restaurant. She works two jobs, has no social life, and saves every penny she can. Just when it seems her dreams are about to come true, there's a bump in the road. When the froggy prince Naveen barters help getting to that dream in exchange for a kiss, she takes it. However, not being the princess Naveen assumed she was, he stays a frog and she turns into one. The two travel through the New Orleans bayou to find the voodoo woman who can change them back, and (obviously) have a life changing journey doing it.Tiana is a good female lead. She's certainly not your classic Disney princess, but she is, at heart, a Disney princess. She'll be a good role model for girls (and boys alike I suppose) on the value of working hard to get what you want. She's countered by her best friend (and New Orleans princess) Charlotte, who has gotten everything she's ever wanted and whose goal is to marry a prince. HOWEVER, despite her ""spoiled rich girl"" background, Charlotte is a fantastic character. She never acts spoiled, and is truly a best friend to Tiana despite the seemingly obvious differences between them. And without spoiling it, her actions in the end of the movie were surprisingly good. (You'll know it when you see it.) I liked that she wasn't painted as the typical, at least partially self-centered out-for-herself best friend. What I also liked was her ...split personality? Talking sweet one minute and shouting in true tomboy fashion the next. This girl rocks.But let's move onto the prince. Naveen. Oh, Naveen. I'm not sure ANYONE would fall for his froggy ""sweet talk""...but it was still hilarious to watch. Here we've got your typical, spoiled, rich kid. Life of luxury, girls, money, etc...until his parents cut him off. Now he's got to marry a rich girl if he wants his old life back. He really doesn't understand Tiana at first, and how she's had to work all her life, but his character development is smooth. And hey, it's Disney, so it's not a spoiler if I tell you he did good in the end, right? But how does he get turned into a frog, you ask? Dr. Facilier, the Shadow Man. There was no one more perfect to be his voice than Keith David. It was AMAZING. Facilier was just the right of amount of pure evil and terror to rival the great Disney villains, even ones as great and evil as Maleficent herself. Disney pulled no punches on creating such a true villain, who does everything from conjuring dark spirits to plotting murders.The one thing about the movie that didn't sit perfectly with me was the music. It was nice to see the return of the people behind some of the best animated movies ever, but it was sad that one of the greatest Disney composers of all time was unable to join them. Instead, we're treated to the musical stylings of Randy Newman. The blunt answer: the music was definitely satisfactory, and more than one song (though sadly not all) had that true Disney energy, but none of the songs will immortalize themselves the way Friend Like Me or Beauty and the Beast or Kiss the Girl did. I can't see teenagers today singing these songs years from now when they've grown up and reminisce. It felt like they shoved one or two many songs into the movie as well. Like they were trying to make up for lost ground in the movies not sporting sing-along-songs. Or maybe it would be more accurate to say that sometimes it just felt like they were showing off, like ""Look, we brought back the musicals!"" I would appreciate it if Newman, assuming he plans to continue his work with Disney, would leave out his signature musical style and compose for the feel of the movie instead.On the flip side though, the animation was SPECTACULAR. If I've missed one thing since the days of classic-Disney it was that smooth, natural feel that only comes from the hand-drawn touch. I don't care what the song in the movie says, it does matter what you look like, at least for movies. I especially liked Tiana's dream sequence, where they switched the animation to match the style of her dream-picture. Nice touch. And needless to say, but I will anyways, the voice work was beyond reproach. The voices fit, and the actors bring character presence to the movie.And on a side note: the homages back to old Disney were well done, everything from the Magic Carpet cameo to the Sleeping Beauty dancing and more.Disney, you had to backtrack a little to do it, but you may have found your way again! Thank you, and keep up the good work! So do yourselves a favor and go see it at least once! ...Unless you beg for more. ;)",The Princess and the Frog

204,hyperballad13,A Ribbeting Story,8,1 June 2010,"Animation, in recent years, has taking a turn with most studios' opting for computerised effects and CGI to fulfil the family film market: Disney being no exception. While recent Pixar outings such as Up and Wall.E are incredible, there has always been that hole and if you were like me; growing up with classics such as The Lion King and Aladdin, there has been an ache for that old school hand-drawn film. The Princess and the Frog is just that film. The Princess and the Frog is based upon that well known tale of the same name. It is a music and sentiment filled fest set in the heart of New Orleans at the peak of its Jazz era. Tiana, a scullery maid and waitress, is our hard-working heroine who dreams of one day opening her own restaurant. This is thwarted when she meets lazy and fun loving Prince Naveen who has unwillingly been turned into a frog by The Shadowman. After convincing Tiana that she must kiss him to break the spell, Naveen is shocked to find that instead of him becoming human; she becomes a frog. The film follows their adventure to not only break the spell but stop The Shadowman. The Princess and the Frog is a rebirth of the classic Disney tales breathing a new life into our beloved animation. The cartoon not only shimmers, literally with spectacular scenes, it captures our hearts in a warming story. And Disney tick many boxes; the animation is amazing setting a colourful land and is beautifully accompanied by show stopping, toe tapping tunes that families will be singing out of the theatres. The film is filled with jokes to not only make the children giggle but tickle some adults as well. Characters such as Louis; a trumpet playing, jazz loving alligator and Ray; the determined yet hopelessly romantic firefly are alive with rich soul. As we follow our heroic couple and friends, we are sent through a fantastical world and a charming tale. But what Disney has always been remarkable at is the way they deal with sadness. A particularly heart-wrenching scene is handled with such delicacy that it becomes stunning, tender and such a striking way to help children deal with such a subject. Guaranteed to drown the driest of eyes, the film will leave you happy with the knowledge that dreams do come true. Yet the film is not perfect and whilst Disney created brilliant characters, they underdeveloped a lot of important ones. The Shadowman plot can seem rushed at times along with Charlotte, Tiana's best friend, and ""Big Daddy"" La Bouf being almost forgotten yet vital to the film. This can sometimes make the main line up seem over exaggerated and a few people may be left bewildered. In the finished product, though, it is a minor flaw and barely disrupts the flow of the movie. The Princess and the Frog is a Disney triumph that they can add to their large belts: fantastic for children of all ages. Warts and all.",The Princess and the Frog

209,brit15012,Visually Stunning. Full of Life,8,21 December 2009,"I was weary of Princess and the Frog because an animated feature hadn't been released in a long time, and with Hercules, Mulan, and The Hunchback, rounding out the last few movies Disney animation did, I was worried. I was ready, however, when the film came out because frankly, I'm a little sick of the CGI stuff and would like to get back to ""old fashioned"" cinema for a while. It's a little hard for me to rate this, only because I think what I saw, and what children see, are quite different. The kids sat wide-eyed with their mouths open and watched from start to finish. No talking, no ""Mom i have to go to the bathroom,"" nothing. For other parents, you know that's quite a feat. The saw the beautiful colors, the comical nuances, the catchy music, the scary shadow man, and were locked in. The story isn't that big of a deal to kids, many of those things they haven't experienced yet. For me the story didn't hold my interest the entire time, and that's what I was looking for. There wasn't the same magic as Beauty and the Beast (one of my all-time favorites) or the same heartwarming quality as The Lion King. The story, in my opinion, fell a little short. For starters, the Prince was more interesting Tiana. He had funny lines, he was damaged, and it was clear as day why he needed to change his personality. Tiana was very serious, and I know they were trying to make her the foil of every silly character in the film, which I found lackluster. All the other princesses, with maybe the exception of Jasmine (but the story wasn't about her, it was Aladin's movie) had some sort of quirky, goofy quality to them. Tiana was hard as nails. She was determined, and had a great head on her shoulders, which was wonderful, but she wasn't all that fun. At the end, that was what she was supposed to change about her self, but I didn't see that happen at all. The ending was quick and made me a little upset. Why, after a whole movie where is she determined to get her restaurant, at the end so willing to throw it away, for a frog prince she's known for 12 hours? I also thought it was a little offensive to the people of the bayou that every character had only a few teeth and spoke funny. My kids thought it was hilarious, but again, I could only think ""If I was from the Bayou..."" Overall, this is a fun, enjoyable movie for kids. The story isn't meant for adults, but hey, this is a Disney movie. I think this is a good start to the animation world, and I'll be interested in seeing what they come up with next.",The Princess and the Frog
210,liseli1,one of the best Disney movies since the 90's,9,13 December 2009,"I liked this movies as much as I liked Aladdin which was my favorite before this. Tiana is definitely the best Disney princess so far she is independent, hard working and wants more from life than to find a man. This movie is not racist at all that I could tell ( though this being a Disney movie and with their history someone somewhere will find something offensive even though nothing seemed like it was meant to be). But overall two thumbs up. Definitely in the top 5 for favorite Disney movies.I also liked the villain ""the shadow man"" is definitely one of the scarier Disney villains up there with Cruella De Ville ( I could see Facilier killing puppies no problem) who scared the crap out of me but in a good way. I also liked Mama Odie she was scary but good of heart underneath it all and Prince Naveen and Tiana's friend Charlotte all turn out to have redeeming qualities. Prince Naveen starts out as a spoiled lazy flirt but its because he's a spoiled rich kid who no one taught any better. And Charlotte's honest desire to sacrifice her dream for her friends dream showed her in a whole new light. Nobody is just black and white ( despite the historic significance of Tiana's heritage) even the villain has some reason for his evil . I liked that every character was multi-faceted even Tiana came off as too judgmental at times and she learned to loosen up from Naveen who learned that life is more than one big party.",The Princess and the Frog
211,TheEverydayGeek,One of Disney's Best Films in a Long Time,8,12 December 2009,"Disney was at its best in the 90s. They came out with such great movies as Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. And then, they made bad movies like Home on the Range. Disney can make good movies, and they usually do. The Princess and the Frog is one of Disney's best movies. It has a great twist on a classic story, characters that made me care, and music that had me tapping my foot and wishing I was in New Orleans. The animation is so beautiful that I literally almost cried at the beginning of the film. Dr. Faciler is probably one of Disney's best villains. Keith David's voice is so creepy and fits perfect into the character. His song ""Friends on the Other Side"" is great and shows just how scary he can be. In most Disney movies, there are usually two or three songs that really stick with you. Every song in this movie was great. I still find myself humming ""Down in New Orleans"" everywhere I go. The bottom line is that Princess and the Frog is one of Disney's best and one of the best films of the year. The only question I can't answer is if it is better than Up. But if I have to answer, I'd say it's equal to it.",The Princess and the Frog
212,couponmomma2009,Excellent New Addition To Disney's Collection!,9,17 March 2010,"I think every little girl's dream is to be a princess and Disney has aspired to at least allow each and every little girl feel that way even if it is only in their imaginations. The much waited for Princess and the Frog came out on Tuesday and has taken its place among the much loved ""princess"" movies.Synposis: Magic, music and romance are waiting around every corner of the legendary Big Easy as Disney's newest princess sets out on an exciting adventure through a magical new world. Tiana (voiced by Anika Noni Rose) is a beautiful and hardworking young woman determined to fulfill her father's dream of owning an elegant New Orleans supper club. When Naveen (Bruno Campos), a handsome prince arrives in town looking for romance, the evil Dr. Facilier (Keith David) hatches a nefarious plot and turns Naveen into a frog. A kiss from Tiana should return him to his true form, but in a hilarious twist on the classic story, she is instead transformed into a frog herself! The pair must travel into the heart of the mysterious Louisiana bayou with only a trumpet-playing alligator and a love-struck firefly as guides to find the priestess who can reverse the curse in order to find their ""happily ever after."" My Opinion: The Princess and The Frog follows in the footsteps in its predecessors such as Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, and Aladdin. The music in the movie was sweet and still held on to its child like magic. The Princess and The Frog while released in 2010 could almost be mistaken for being released almost 10 or 15 years ago. I liked this because it had what little girl's are looking for in a princess. I honestly was afraid this movie wouldn't have the sweetness of previous Disney princess movies but that was not the case.While every ""princess"" movie has some darkness because it is all the fight against good and evil, I did not think The Princess and The Frog had as much The Little Mermaid and other princess movies have had in the past. There were still some very dramatic moments that a preschooler or younger child may not understand. I definitely think that this is a movie that a parent should watch with your younger child.Overall, this movie was well made and I believe will become a precious addition for all those that have loved the previous Disney movies.",The Princess and the Frog

I liked how the message this movie gives kids is totally different, showing that a person can love, be happy, and work to get what they want. Unlike the other Disney cartoons, the main focus of the girl was not a guy but to accomplish her goal, and then she fell in love in the process. All the characters are very lovable (I'm not very fond of the villain, though, in comparison to Ursula, Scar, etc.), the comedy is in the right amount and the story is sweet.

215,damary200,Disney's first American classic fairytale,10,11 June 2011,"Most of the reviews both by Disney fans and critics alike are all focusing on the wrong viewpoint of this film. The point is not that Tiana is African American (my children don't notice because children don't see ""colors""on skin) or that this is not exactly traditional Disney fare. The point is that a modern character faced modern problems and that love and the timeless story of The Princess and the Frog prevailed. Tiana is a frog for nearly the entirety of the film because that is who she was in life. In fact, she's a frog from the beginning until the last 15 minutes of the film and becomes human long before the surprise ending of the Dr. Facilier's frog spell. True it was Prince Naveen who ""transformed"" her but Tiana's refusal to see love or friendship was caused by ambition. This ambition wasn't bad or for selfish reasons, but in pursuit of her fathers dream she ignored everything he had tried to teach her. If you look past the political correctness or the ""coloring issues"" within the movie you can see this clear as day! My four year old got it and when Tiana goes in search of Naveen to tell him that she's fallen for him, my son declared loudly in the middle of the theater, ""he love her mama!"". When the Charlotte tries to break the spell without ""getting her prince"" he was ecstatic and when he saw the impostor prince ""marrying"" Charlotte he was heartbroken. The magic is not Disney fare but it fits in perfectly with a cultural immersion of New Orleans. It goes without saying that the animation is GORGEOUS and the music is good too. The gospel number with Mama Odie is by far my favorite! The secondary characters almost steal the show. Charlotte in all her spoiled glory is actually a big-hearted, cute and hilarious Southern Belle. Mama Odie is lovable and zany and goes around nearly killing her beloved pet snake and smacking ""young 'uns"" on the arm for their ""stupidity"". Big Louis is funny and gives the movie a faster pace. Ray is by far my VERY favorite ""supporting actor"" and will belong in the same pantheon with Jimminy Cricket and Tinker Bell. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but Disney's second star to the right will be immortalized forever thanks to Ray. All in all the modern retelling of the fairy tale is needed for this generation. Times are hard, we have to work harder and our dreams may not come true in the way we thought they would, but LOVE is still worth fighting for. Disney thinks that Love is worth the revival of hand drawn animation, actual orchestra's composing the soundtrack and YEARS working on a modern story board. This is not the revival of hand drawn animation, it is the revival of the Love story for a generation who forgot how to fall in Love. It's a modern example of what poets, writers and legends have been in pursuit of for centuries. The idea of Love without bounds that can defeat any obstacle.",The Princess and the Frog
216,opscrowbert,The Princess in the FOG.,2,20 September 2011,"In the beginning, I really believed this would be a Disney film that I enjoy. -I've seen Tiana thrown onto Princess decor alongside Disney classic princesses, so it must be a great movie, right? Sigh. I'm not entirely sure why there were even Tiana dolls made... she is a slimy little frog all but ten minutes of the film! -The prince was flat out arrogant and hardly a fairytale sweep you off your feet type of guy. -Every couple of minutes I noticed more and more things that reminded me of other Disney movies. BETTER Disney movies. -I did enjoy a few of the characters and have to admit I shed a single tear when that second star lit up in the sky. -In all brutal honesty, I felt like this was a grimy swamp version of The Little Mermaid. -Had as much thought went into enriching the storyline as there was put into referencing the classics, it really could have been a great movie. I love the idea of New Orleans Voodoo. The Princess and the Frog (or should I say, The Frog and the Frog) fell flat of expectation.",The Princess and the Frog
217,daniellelhill88,A joy,10,7 December 2013,"As a young black woman, I love this movie. Many people, I have heard, take issues with this movie due to a varies number of reasons: 1. the princess spends the bulk of the movie as a frog 2. the prince is NOT African, but Latin, and is financially ruined 3. the person that guides Tiana is a wrinkled old woman, that practices voodoo, instead of being a lovely fairy 4. Tiana works two jobs, and doesn't seem to be able to get any where in life To these I say boo on you. I think that this movie, above ALL other Disney movies, gives little girls a realistic idea of how one should live their life. Tiana is a hard working, independent black woman, and I think that she is a great role model for little girls. It doesn't matter that she spends the bulk of the movie as a frog. Her flaw is that she works too hard to accomplish what she wants out of life. I think I would prefer if when I had a daughter she look up to Tiana than have her look up to the likes of Aurora or Snow White. I like that Disney has shown interracial relationships. I don't think that it diminishes the movies charm just because Naveen is a Latin male. I think that no matter what Disney does, no one will every be happy. I have oftern heard this movie called racist and again I say boo. It is set in the 1920's and the way they Tiana and Charlotte are friends shows that they are attempting to push past their norm. I beg people to see the charm and beauty in this film, and for people of color to be proud that we finally have a princess that our little girls can aspire to be.",The Princess and the Frog
218,thesplash,Back to it's Roots? Disney should Keep Moving Forward,5,16 January 2010,"I was very excited to see this movie with my mom. I am 22 and have always seen the Disney summer blockbusters with her, so when this came out we could not wait.Overall, the animation was nice (bright colors, very New Orleans) but the story line and the music did not compare to Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast or even Hercules. Leaving the theater I was not humming a tune or looking to go get the soundtrack. I actually could not remember many of the songs and the only ones I could were very repetitive and not good. I was very surprised when I saw Toy Story composer Randy Newman also did this movie.Princess Tiana was adorable but you do not see much of her. I remember reading an article when the movie was first released that some people of color were upset that Disney made a black princess but she's a frog the entire movie. They were absolutely right. Princess Tiana was a frog for at least 90% of this movie and honestly, watching a frog for almost an hour and a half was slow and not visually appealing. I would rather have seen her change back sooner because it was drawn out quite a bit.Most of the characters were likable. Tiana's friend Charolette was cute and the villain was very very intriguing. He was probably my favorite character. However, while listening to Prince Naveen speak, I could only think of Kevin Klein's accent in the movie French Kiss (you get the picture). Charolette's father, voiced by John Goodman was a surprise and made me think of Sully; warm and caring. Their swamp friends had some potential as well; the alligator and the firefly captured New Orleans very well.Overall if you go in to this movie with low expectations you will probably find it enjoyable. For Disney though, how can you go in thinking it would be bad? If Disney plans on going back to it's 2D animation roots, they should go back to their amazing story lines and memorable music as well. Otherwise, keep moving forward.",The Princess and the Frog
219,rebelbmf,A New Favorite!!!!!!!,10,10 April 2020,"Of course we have are old Disney classics that will never get old, this movie deserves just as much classic credit. A great adaptation of an old story. Every character in this story is amazing, from the villain to the supporting comedic duo of Ray and Lewis, we watch as a family every spring as a tradition dating from 2010 and it never gets old, I love many Disney movies, this one is our reining champ of 10 years and going!!!",The Princess and the Frog
220,amikos,Disappointed,3,25 May 2018,"So much potential....and I think this was a half hearted attempt at Disney throwing together a ""feature"" movie with....*gasp*...an Disney princess of color. They could have gone so many different ways with this and every way they took was disappointing. The whole movie felt forced like they just put it out to say, ""we celebrate diversity"" >insert eye roll< I hope they make a more valiant attempt soon because they need to try again and not just have the ""one"" to say they did it. There's room for improvement and I hope they make another go at it!",The Princess and the Frog
221,samk-2,Prejudiced,9,15 April 2012,"This is a classic right up there with Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. The characters are lovable, the atmosphere is warm and inviting and the acting is incredible. There are 2 problems as I see them. The first one is the story is complicated at times and does get a little over your head. The other problem is that a lot of people may actually see it as racist. This is bullshit. Tiana is the first African American princess and Naveen is the first prince from the middle east. The other problem I see it as people nowadays see hand drawn animation as ""kid's stuff."" Hand Drawn animation is cool! It really is overlooked and this is definitely one amazing movie",The Princess and the Frog
222,sherrybedpost,"Historically Inaccurate, but great plot",7,10 May 2015,"I loved ALMOST everything about this movie, other than the Historical inaccuracy. Yes, though the movie, like most Disney movies did have fantastical characters (characters of fantasy) of talking animals, that did not mean there was any room for historical inaccuracy in the storyline. Though the audience that the movie was projected to would not notice something like this until they got older and re-watched it (like I did), I'm still going to point it out because it slightly bothers me. I was 9 when I first watched it and recently re-watched it at the age of 14 and thats when it hit me square in the face, let me explain. Sure, the art of the movie was historically accurate, with the drawing of the cars and houses and ferryboats, but the movie, set in the 1920's Louisiana, hosted a friendship between a lower-class African American female and an upper-class White female. Anyone who's taken anything past 2nd grade History Class should know that THIS JUST Didn't HAPPEN. If this were anything close to accurate, Charlotte, Tiana's white best friend should've turned her nose up at the thought of even talking to someone like Tiana. Especially regarding Tiana's skin color, occupation and social class. Point-blank period. This is 1920's Louisiana and that is what people like Charlotte were taught. Its just the harsh reality of our history in America I'm sorry.",The Princess and the Frog
223,morganalyx-1,Such an amazing film,10,21 December 2009,"I just saw this this weekend & it BLEW me away! SO good! The reasons that I loved this movie are:1) Not one bad song in the bunch. In fact, I plan to get the soundtrack ASAP. 2) The story was awesome. Disney should stick to fairy tale adaptations & leave the original stories to Pixar. 3) The animation...WooHoo! Kudos to Disney for going back to what they know best! Not only is the animation great during all the regular scenes, but the specially-stylized animation for Tiana's song ""Almost There"" was very cool too, as well as The Shadowman's ""friends"" from the other side.I haven't enjoyed a Disney animated movie this much since Atlantis. Definitely, GO SEE IT!",The Princess and the Frog
224,semisweet-56984,So Disappointing,2,15 January 2017,"I am very disappointed in Disney for this film. Here we have Disney's first Black/African American princess and she's poor, almost like a servant to a white blonde haired woman and she spends 96% of the movie as a frog! On top of that the movie is scary and dark, the songs aren't memorable (the music is an important part of Disney, I was just so upset that I couldn't remember one song after leaving the theater) and the characters and their drawls is just unsettling. If I recall correctly some were missing teeth and had the most obnoxious offensive accents that you could give a character in a movie about a black princess. The animation was not breathtaking as many of Disney's movies usually are. The animation was flat and dry.Why couldn't the princess marry a black man? Most of all the Disney princesses have married/fell in love with someone of their race with the exception of Pocahontas which is historically based so it does not count. They could have made a beautiful princess and give her an interesting and intriguing background and setting. I can't stand that they went to New Orleans for this one, just why? Disney should just erase Tiana, pretend like she never existed and start from scratch completely. This princess deserves better than that.",The Princess and the Frog
225,emilferz,Mixed Feelings,6,29 September 2021,"The Princess and the Frog is a real mixed bag for me it has some solid storytelling and creates well fleshed out characters particularly in the first 30 mins and then really looses steam as it progresses. When I say that I mean the moment the main characters turn into frogs.The first 30 minutes really creates a fleshed out personality in Tiana who is struggling to earn enough money to buy a property so she accomplish her and her fathers dream of owning a restaurant. You are seeing how hard she is working and are really rooting for her to do this. I find that this is really relatable to a lot of everyday people who may have similar goals or struggles.Prince Naveen is quite the entertaining character and displays his explosive personality making for some enjoyable sequences. The villain Doctor Facilier is an enjoyable presence on screen providing what I think is the best song of the film Friends On The Other Side. Keith David also really nails the character you can tell he is really enjoying himself.Then they turn into frogs and the film turns into your stereotypical adventure of we need to do this before we run out of time situation. Tiana and Prince Naveen turning into frogs really killed any of the connection the two had for me and really made their characters less relatable.The humor in this film is very unoriginal and just relies on generic slapstick and childish jokes. The side characters introduced are not that great expect for Mama Odie who I very much enjoyed watching, unfortunately they tended to just be quite irritating especially Ray.Overall this film had great potential to be a Disney classic with its unique setting in the lovely city of New Orleans and a great foundation for these characters to be incredible. It unfortunately completely crumbles into a generic kids cartoon for most of the film.",The Princess and the Frog
226,bijoukaiba,"I Laughed, I Cried, I Loved This Film!",10,12 December 2009,"I literally just got back from seeing this film... I had been waiting about 1-2 years for this film, and I was not disappointed.The return to hand-drawn animation is beautifully presented, with a wide array of colors and special effects, including a brief montage of Art Deco style in ""Almost There"".The music is wonderful. Some people were concerned they wouldn't enjoy the film without Alan Menken composing, since Randy Newman did the music. Don't be. Newman's music is wonderful. I expect to see some of his songs/his score being nominated for awards this year.How did the characters stack up? All of them were lovable in some way. Tiana's determined spirit, Naveen's carefree nature, Louis's longing to play jazz, Dr. Facilier's charisma, Ray's selfless and kind personality... there is something to love about everyone. The only 3 complaints I had were (1) The movie's pacing was a bit quick, (2) I wanted the songs to be a little longer, and (3) I wish the villain had been a little more involved in the plot. But even then, these are just me being greedy, like the kid who asks for seconds at dessert. I got everything to satisfy, but I still just want more.I got so wrapped up in this movie. I got everything I wanted, but I still longed for more. I was perfectly happy, yet I wanted to be happier. The characters got their happy end, yet I wanted to learn more about their lives. Welcome back, Disney. I've missed you for several years.",The Princess and the Frog
227,sapphire-dragon,Just a quick note on a GREAT movie,10,16 December 2009,"The Princess and the Frog was a great classic style movie. It combines the music styles of the Jungle Book (very catchy) with the bad guys of Anastasia and the Emperor's New Groove and the magic of Cinderella. This movie is great for the whole family and many people need to take into account what children are exposed to everyday in the real world, there is much worse graphic scenes in the news today and scarier things the children of today watch on TV. * Also as a note to those who believe this was the scariest Disney movie to date does no-one remember Anastasia, that movie had much worse 'magic' scenes and the antagonist was a rotting, dismembered corpse! As for those who mentioned the death in this movie at least it can be used as a viable way to introduce a child to death for example 'don't worry your fish has just died but he became a star and you can still see him every night' Sorry this was longer than I thought but this movie was a great addition to the Disney classics and deserves its great rating.",The Princess and the Frog
228,atoya,Disney's Princess and the Frog is a film of pure malice and racism,2,18 September 2010,"I was shocked by the many, many negative messages about being a black child or adult contained in the Princess and the Frog, the incredibly racist animated film from Disney Studios. I would never allow my Grandchildren to see this film because of the racist stereotypes, and my Grandkids are white. I have no desire to acquaint them with the bigoty and racism of 50 years ago.I can only image the shock and horror of black parents who took their kids to see this racist film. Walt Disney would turn over in his grave that such a piece of hateful bigotry should bear his name.WHAT WERE THEY THINKING at Disney to release such a vile and bigoted film????? There was a real need for an African-American Princess, for little girls to look up to, there still is. Perhaps another, more enlightened, Animation Studio will create one.The emphasis on VooDoo, the Occult guarantee than many Christian parents will not allow their children to see this movie, that is just bad business. It could have been a positive film, but sadly, it was not. The Princess and the Frog is an all time low for Disney.",The Princess and the Frog
229,simplecry,A reminder of the Past and an excellent comeback!,10,27 December 2009,"Disney has left many of us bitter and skeptical of anything they make. From the disgusting sequels to the crappy CGI films Disney seemed to miss their mark in successful repetition. The only thing they could accomplish was ruining the princess collection and creating straight to DVD films that didn't teach kids anything. The Disney Channel went from greatness to crappy shows that are rivaled by Nick and Cartoon Network. Everything about Disney has fallen to a bleak level under the muck of crappy children films. No Longer is Disney known for being ""Family Films"" or ""Fun for the Whole Family"" instead, they have characters that are as flat as a sheet of paper, non-existent or bad morals, immature comic relief, and very bad songs or none at all. Well, now the company has changed it's executives and they have promised to end the assault on well made animated films. Disney didn't seem to deliver on the promise; animated films were still being made in CGI instead of hand drawn. Movies attempted to raise the bar but still fell short. Don't get me wrong I loved Bolt and Enchanted, but, it still wasn't up to the standards I knew Disney could produce and that made me more skeptical. Upon discovering however, that Disney was making a full length animated (hand drawn) film I was very excited. Was Disney coming out of the disaster it put itself in? That was the question raised; and I am proud to say successfully answered.The Princess and the Frog hit the mark and raised the bar for future films. Going back to it's roots and producing a film that the whole family can enjoy. With an excellent story, dazzling characters, great songs to boot, and a villain that actually poses a threat. No more of these villains who are fluffy and boring. No more childish characters and immature humor. The Princess and the Frog gives us a story that makes children and adults think, gave children a hero to look up to, a villain to hate, and morals that they can apply to life. The humor was family friendly while still being able to entertain adults, and the comic relief was not immature making the story that much better and not watered down. The best part to me was that Tiana was African-American. Being multi-racial myself I really enjoyed being able to relate to a princess and to see that children have a princess that isn't afraid to wish for her dreams AND work for them. No more sitting on the balcony and wishing for a prince. As romantic and sweet as that is, it doesn't really teach much. Now don't get me wrong the movie doesn't come without it's problems, but, they are not bad enough for this movie to not receive such a glowing review. Personally I wish that Alen Menken was the composer because Randy Newman seems to irritate me in every movie he does. The Princess and the Frog's musical score got very tiring VERY fast. The only five songs I liked were the opening song, Almost there, my friends on the other side, Ma Belle Evangeline, and dig a little deeper. Everything in that movie was Jazz. By the end of the movie I was ready to stab my ears out. I liked Jazz until now, thats how bad it was for me. Even though it is a movie that takes place in the birth land of Jazz, there wasn't really any traditional Disney songs. Ma Belle Evangeline was close but still came with it's hint of Jazz. They over did the Jazz and that is one folly. The villain was great, but comparing him to the other classic villains he was more of a sidekick. His friends from the other side could be viewed as the true villain but, they still were not menacing. And those two were really the only issue I had with the film.Before I finish, I want to state a few of my favorite things that I saw, and I hope many other appreciate also. As I mentioned earlier it was neat to have an African American Heroin and being multi-racial it was even better! I was very worried that they would sugarcoat the racial difference or overdo it and come off as insensitive, but I think Disney found a happy medium. The racism was settle and truthful and could not be avoided to tell an accurate and well rounded story and I liked that. Even when they say ""A little girl of your background"" stung a bit but was a necessity and tastefully done. I really enjoyed the historical accuracies it had. The best part of the whole thing to me is they went back to their roots and killed characters. They didn't just kill them, they did it in the open. It wasn't insensitive to kids but as an adult it did make you cringe a little. For me I am excited to see the things Disney produces and I'm also excited to know that the tradition is coming back. As they say if it's not broke don't fix it. Well Walt Disney had an excellent formula for films that lasted until the late 90's until people tried to ""fix it"". It seems like to me people don't take pride in their art anymore and CGI isn't always great to me. Man was given the ability to tell a story through handmade artwork and that needs to come back.All in All I am very proud that this has Disney's name on it and The Princess and the Frog is a wonderful film that deserves its recognition. I give it a ten out of ten and can't wait to see more great films in the future.",The Princess and the Frog

I'd begun to lose hope in Disney for awhile, but Princess and the Frog has renewed my faith in them. It's a truly beautiful film with amazing music, and the animation is just... spectacular isn't a good enough word. The movements are so fluid, and the sceneries and characters are so colorful and creative. I was especially enamored by Dr. Facillier and his ""Friends on the Other Side"" scene. Keith David is a master at voice acting, and his deep singing voice was so fitting and sinister. When I first saw Naveen's design, I wasn't sure about it, but it translates beautifully on screen, just like the rest of them. Every character was cast perfectly, and Randy Newman effortlessly wrote songs that are just as good as Howard Ashman's and Alan Menken's. It's a movie I'd definitely see again, trust me, and any Disney fan who loved The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and/or the Lion King should definitely catch it.Welcome back, Disney.

The writing was lousy, the music was forgettable and NOT age-appropriate and the story was just plain boring. My husband and I kept looking at our watches, praying it was almost over. Our 10 year-old daughter enjoyed it, so I guess that's all that matters.I was hoping the first Disney cartoon with an African-American princess would be good, but it was sooooo disappointing. The black stereotypes were pretty insulting too. It was NOT enjoyable watching two frogs throughout the movie! This made me miss really good Disney fare like Little Mermaid, Mulan and Alladin. Why couldn't they find some good song writers like those from the afore-mentioned movies? Disney can afford this!Two thumbs down.",The Princess and the Frog

A definite leap of faith for Walt Disney Co's first hand-animated feature film in nearly six years and with it not being geared only to children, the audiences are eating it up! Directors Ron Clements and John Musker, who brought us such fantastic, lasting classics as Aladdin and The Little Mermaid have completely hit their mark with this hilarious and wonderfully told fairytale. A surprising set of characters takes this version miles from the bedtime story you remember. A fable that spans the globe, commonly known as The Frog Princess, Disney takes you somewhere you definitely don't expect.Set in the remarkable city of New Orleans, amphibian meets beautiful princess. This sassy frog desperately wants to return to his former state of human and finding Princess Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) is his ticket away from the bayou.Before you pass this because Disney = Kids, stop! They're taking a step away from the CGI and picking up the pencil again, and it's definitely worth a watch if not just for that. You've got to appreciate the skill that went into drawing this. It's so great to see Disney doing what it does bestillustrating a story. Bringing the adventures we used to only hear about, to vivid, astonishing life.

I almost wept when some morons at Disney declared the end of 2D animation with the dung pile that was ""Home on the Range"", so when I heard some sensible people were taking Disney over and bringing classic animation back, I jumped for joy! A princess movie, even better one featuring a black princess! An intelligent, hard working, beautiful, African American heroin has been a long time coming in the ""Wonderful World of Disney"". The voice casting was great, the music was superb, and the characters were the most lovable cast since ""Beauty and the Beast"". I'm so glad I can take my daughters to the same classic animated features I enjoyed growing up, and they can look up to a Disney princess who looks like them! I could watch this film 1,000 times over, and that's saying a lot considering the crap that tends to come out these days. My one and only criticism is the voodoo stuff.

235,diaclaybo22,Not impressed and actually offended,1,12 December 2009,"I am not sure what movie these other people whom wrote comments saw, however the movie Princess and the Frog that my best friend and I just went and took our daughters and my nephew to see was a huge disappointment. 1. My issue with this movie is that Disney is calling Tiana a Princess, however she was not a Princess she was a poor young woman throughout the entire movie until the Prince married her at the very end. 2. the big hype about this movie was that Disney finally had an African American Princess however Tiana was only displayed as an African American that the beginning of the movie and again at the very end of the movie because she was a frog the entire time. 3. I understand the whole New Orleans background to this movie and from the previews I thought that it would be a reasonable amount of New Orleans soul to it(the music and accents did well) however there were a lot of the negative stereotypes from New Orleans that did not need to be included in this movie nor introduced to children of this age group. 4. Another disturbing twist to this movie that bothered me was the fact that they killed off a character (Ray the firefly) which seemed unnecessary and too mature for preschool+ aged children. The upside to the death of Ray was that he got to be with the star that he thought was a girl and that was a very touching part of the movie.5. The biggest offense of this movie to me was the OVER THE TOP use of voodoo and demons and spirits. The demon (friends on the other side) was too strong and it was scary. As a Christian I felt that this was very offensive and uncalled for most importantly. I was so very excited about this movie (my daughter and I have been waiting since we saw the first preview back in July) and I must say I feel like Disney has let me down. I had purchased a Princess and the Frog doll for one of my daughters Christmas gifts and I will be taking it back because I do not want the spiritual connection of demons and spirits in my household. I also do not want to reward Disney by purchasing all of the products as I normally have done in the past with other Disney movies.

If your a Christian this is not the movie to watch I didn't know the movie had so much in it.

I have sorely missed Disney's hand drawn animation and have been somewhat spiteful towards the computer animation. I think Finding Nemo was a great first attempt at a Classic but I am waiting to see a full animated Disney film with the beauty of Pandora's (Avatar) animation. After Enchanted I having been waiting impatiently to see P&tF.The animation in P&tF is stunning and can only be compared to something like Bambi. Admittedly they use some computer animation, but this is subtle and enhances the screen. The backgrounds sometimes steal the show, the Fireflys are particularly stunning & the characters look beautiful and funny (or scary).I have been a fan of Jazz for about 3 years now, and I just loved the music in this film. I was hoping for something funky and new like The Little Mermaid did for its time. And I kinda of got it, only it was in the style of 1920s/1930s jazz. But it was new. And it was funky. :) Best music! And you should expect lots of music. In the footsteps of pretty much every Disney Classic; its full of music.Oh and the story? Very cute (but mostly predictable) but it made me laugh and welled up ready to cry at points (I have only cried TWICE in my whole life while watching a film: 1. When I was a child and Bambi's mother died and 2. When I was a nerd at the end of LotR: RotK) (NB: I am still a nerd). The characters were very original and amusing, however even though Disney were trying so hard not to be racist against African Americans when making this film, I found the 3 hillbilly's who try to catch the frogs were kinda racist toward whites. (But you apparently can never be racist towards whites) Overall I loved it loved it loved it! I can't wait to buy a copy to watch over and over and over again! I highly recommend this movie.",The Princess and the Frog
239,Jamcgowa,The Frog that Could Not Make the Jump,3,23 February 2010,"I am a huge fan of Disney movies and an even bigger fan of Disney's princesses. So when I was asked to go view Disney's newest princess movie with my young nieces I was excited to see if the legacy would live on for another generation. In case you were unaware, this new, princess movie is The Princess and the Frog, released December 11, 2009, and is set during the lively 1920s jazz era in New Orleans. From the beginning, I could tell that Disney's team had attempted to make this story homogeneous to the other princess movies. Sticking to the rules of a true Disney tale, princess as our main character, Tiana, who has aspirations for her future but must overcome various obstacles to see her dreams come to reality. For a change, this time our princess is a poor African American women working three jobs to attain funds to open her own dream restaurant. I could immediately see that Tiana's story is very similar to that of Cinderella, however instead of two evil stepsisters, Tiana has two evil bankers preventing her dream from coming true. Another parallel to the Cinderella story, Tiana is invited to a ball where all of her trouble begins. From this point forward Disney abandons the Cinderella plot to mimic another of their classics: Beauty and the Beast. Tiana meets the prince at this point but he is not what a prince should be, similar to the unattractive first impression the Beast imposes upon Belle. Whereas Bell leaves the human world and starts talking to dishes, Tiana stops talking to humans once she meets Prince Naveen. The two proceed to go on an exciting adventure through the Louisiana Bayou as Tiana tries to save the day while she sings songs all along the way. I believe that every girl need a role model who teaches them to go after what they want and not just let things come to them. I feel that this movie sends a good message, but I do not think watching a frog go through challenges in a swamp will inspire anyone. Of course, being a Disney movie, there is a villain trying to stop our heroes. Princess' particular villain, the ""witch doctor"" who transformed people into frogs, scared even me and I am sure my nieces did not have a restful night after seeing the witch doctor from this film. He sent ghosts to get blood from the prince. Disney tried to make him like Ursula, from the Little Mermaid, who happens to be a sea witch. Ursula I could deal with when I was four, now being nineteen I could not even handle Tiana's witch doctor. Disney put their classic love story plot in this film just like most of their others but this one had a nice twist that shows there is still good in people. This was the only part of the plot that was new for Disney to show and kept me guessing on how and when they were going to fit the undeniable love story into the story line. Another thing I enjoyed that they did bring back from Disney classics is the songs that did not just play in the background as the characters went about their routine but songs that the characters sung and will stay in your head long after seeing the film.When the film was over and my nieces were dragging me out of the theater all I could think of was what my dad would have said if he were there, "" I could have written that."" In my opinion the movie fell flat. I found it to be predictable and boring even for my two young nieces. I am sure that other little girls have found this story line overplayed. I went in expecting a new original princess movie from Disney and rather was presented with a hodgepodge of past Disney classics. I love Disney because of their originality. The Princess and the Frog was a recycled story line that might have been better off going straight to DVD or a movie made for television.",The Princess and the Frog
240,mamapres,Hated It,2,6 April 2010,"I didn't like this movie from the first five minutes I was watching it. First of all the movie was FULL of racial stereo types which I did not at all appreciate. The little rich spoiled rotten white girl was very blatant and offensive. Also the movie was like one big commercial for voodoo for kids. Kids don't need to even know there's something called voodoo, why does an animated children's movie have to introduce such things? Last part of my huge disappointment was the atrocious music. Remember movies like Pete's Dragon and Jungle Book? man it used to be ALL about the memorable music. Most children's movies now have terrible music that my 7yr old could have written, this movie is no exception. I wish me and my kids had never watched this.",The Princess and the Frog

Princess Tiana Disney's The Princess and the Frog is a film that's certain to entertain the children and parents. The Princess and the Frog is a reversal of the classic The Swan Princess with both films having talking frogs, both films have very similar motifs. In this thrilling tale of faith, love and determination, Princess Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) is a young beautiful southern bell with the dream of owning her own restaurant. Princess Tiana's love for food and cooking comes from her Big Daddy (John Goodman) who's passed away. Princess Tiana works as a waitress day and night in hopes of fulfilling her dreams. Just as she gets close to her goal on the down payment for the restaurant, here comes Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) from a far away country, who is a spoiled brat that is now broke and has been sent away by his parents to find and marry a rich Princess. He sets his sights on Tiana's friend/employer, the rich spoiled brat, Charlotte. But Prince Naveen never makes it that far, so instead Prince Naveen take's full advantage of the kind-hearted southern bell Tiana, who he thinks is a Princess and asks her to kiss him to turn him back into a handsome Prince. Princess Tiana: Just one kiss? Prince Naveen: Just one, unless you beg for more. Well there's only one problem with that, Tiana not the true Princess so the curse back fires and turns her into a frog as well. They are now both captives of a spell cast by the evil voodoo villain Dr. Facilier (Keith David). But life in the swamp is just unveiling for the two friends; they meet a sly talking Alligator Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley), who plays jazz saxophone and firefly Ray (Jim Cummings), who fills the Jiminy Cricket role on this embarking journey to find Mama Odie, (Jennifer Lewis) in hope that she can offset the curse that the evil voodoo Dr. Facilier has placed on them before it's too late. As they learn the true meaning of friendship and love and that ""In pursuing your dreams, don't lose sight of what you have right in front of you,"" the film offers the a well worth it lesson that sometimes you might have to sacrifice what you want for what you truly need and believe. One of my favorite scenes was when Prince Naveen realizes that he loves Tiana just for who she is knowing she is not a Princess. There is a slow motion shot as Prince Naveen tries to say to her how he feels and can't and just turns and walks away you can just see how the director slows the shot down and Tiana just watches as he walks away and you can feel the unspoken love they have for one another. And you know Prince Naveen is a changed frog. This film will keep the children and parents laughing from start to finish.",The Princess and the Frog
242,mselburton,"""Almost There""",9,25 April 2010,"""The Princess and The Frog"" is a classic tale of ""The Frog Prince"" with a fresh and new twist. We begin our journey with waitress Tiana, played by Anika Noni Rose, in hard pursuit of turning her daddy's dream of owning a restaurant into a reality. When she finally thinks she has the restaurant, she loses it again due to lack of finance. Meanwhile, Prince Naveen of Maldonia (Bruno Campos), in search of financial stability as well, gets bamboozled by the Shadow Man, played by Keith David, and turned into a frog. Naveen sees Tiana at a Masquerade Ball, mistakes her for a princess and convinces her to kiss him to turn him back human; he also promises to compensate her. The plan backfires and they both end up being frogs. Soon the two set out together in search of Mama Odie, a blind voodoo priestess who serves as the film's Fairy Godmother (Jenifer Lewis), to turn the pair into humans again; but she actually shows the pair what really need. ""The Princess and The Frog"" shows that while we may know what we want, we will never truly enjoy it unless we have what we need: Love. It begins in the scene where Tiana is home with her mother Eudora and father James. Her parents are about to put young Tiana to bed when her father holds on to Eudora's hand and tells Tiana to promise him that she will never lose sight of what is really important. The directors used proximity and the body language of the character to emphasize the point that they were trying to get across. James and Eudora are very close in this shot; there is also use of body language and eye contact to show that the couple is in love and value and set one another as priority in life. Throughout the movie, the directors continue to use proximity and the body language of the characters to show how Tiana and Prince Naveen develop, become closer and realize the how important love is. There are plenty of other Disney movies that share the same thematic ideas as ""The Princess and The Frog"". These movies such as Pocahontas show that we cannot reach our full potential or truly enjoy the full extent of life without embracing love. The directors of Pocahontas use the Dream motif throughout the film to help Pocahontas realize her heart's true desires. There was also Grandmother Willow, the film's fairy Godmother, to help Pocahontas understand what her dreams mean. With the help of eye-catching animations, enticing tunes and an unforgettable troupe of characters, Disney turns this traditional story into a modern-day classic.",The Princess and the Frog
243,nclayman,Stereotypical characters?!?!?!?!?,6,15 April 2011,"Charlotte LaBouff ,the princess's friend from childhood, is a rich, spoiled white girl who has blue eyes, blond hair, and acts like an airhead. Instead of playing by stereotypes and possible ""norms,"" the character could just as easily have different color hair/eyes and still be an airhead, if that is indeed necessary.Dr. Facilier ,a.k.a. Shadowman, (played by a black man) is a spooky black man who practices voodoo. The only obvious characteristics that I found to be stereotypical about him were his voodoo practice, his large lips and the big gap between his two front teeth. In order to make this a little less stereotypical, I would remove the gap from his teeth and make his bottom lip a little less ""juicy."" The voodoo practice is only understandable because Disney needs a bad guy, and a voodoo man in New Orleans plays the part perfectly.Eudora ,the princess's mother, (played by OPRAH!!!) is one of the least stereotypical characters in the movie. This makes sense – if Oprah was in my movie, I would let her do whatever she wanted. I assume that she would not care to play a role that was extremely stereotypical of a black person. I would not change anything about her character.James ,the princess's father, (played by a black man) looks a bit stereotypical, especially since his nose takes up one-third of his face. He also has some of the biggest lips in the movie. I would simply take the width of his nose and narrow it by about 15-20 percent.Lawrence ,the prince's butler, (played by a white man) looks like a GORILLA. Although the character is white, his head has multiple characteristics of a gorilla's head. His jaw bone is very long, and he has an upturned nose and a flat, angled head. This is one of the few characters that I would change completely. His whole face needs to be redesigned.Mama Odie ,the old voodoo woman, (played by a black woman) resembles a stereotypical old, black woman. She is fat, wears a big hat – similar to ones Aretha Franklin typically wears – and large, flat earrings. She has very wide cheek bones, winkles in place of eyebrows and lips with no color whatsoever. I would have given her hair on her eyebrows and made her lips a little more red-toned.Prince Naveen (PLAYED BY A WHITE MAN!!!!!!!) has all of the characteristics of a white person, but has a light brown skin tone. He has thin lips, perfectly rounded ears, and a smaller chiseled nose and chin. This is another character whose features I would completely change. Either change the skin tone to white, so that his skin tone matches his features, or change his features to match his skin tone.",The Princess and the Frog
244,coral9790,Absolutely fantastic!,10,17 November 2011,"Finally, Disney is back! I saw this movie at the cinemas and I must say it was fantastic. *WARNING, SPOILERS BELOW!* So a little girl from New Orleans grows up with an amazing talent- cooking. Being so poor with her mother and father though, the talent never left the back porch. Wanting to make her fathers dream real since he never got the chance to until her died, she works double, sometimes triple shifts. This goes on for years until she meets the prince, who was turned into a frog by ""the shadow man"", a man who ""has friends on the other side"" and makes deals with people and gaining profit, by using evil voodoo. After the prince begs her to kiss him, she turns into a frog too, and together they set out on an adventure with a friendly alligator and a funny firefly to find ""Mama Odie"" who also does voodoo, and she helps them discover whats really important.This movie will make you laugh, maybe cry, and definitely get an ""aaw!"" out of you.

245,mommapuddin,"OK, if you like sub-par movies",1,5 July 2012,"This movie had some great promise. I LOVE Dixieland Jazz and Bayou music, I truly do! But the storyline was dull. There was ONE character I ALMOST liked, there was one song I almost liked, and some names I almost remembered. All in all, a pretty poor movie. Not worth the effort of watching.I was hoping for a cute, magical version of the frog prince with some Cajun music thrown in. Instead I got a lumbering, boring dirge of a movie with boring dialogue and poorly written songs. If everyone doesn't figure out after the first five minutes that Tiana and the Prince are meant to be together, then there is SOMETHING wrong with them. This movie is TOO EASY to decode, even for young children. Blech",The Princess and the Frog
246,cquinnsouthafrica,"Good, but not great",6,25 August 2012,"I just finished watching ""Princess"" on DVD with my 11, 9, and 7 year olds for the first time. I love Disney films and had heard positive feedback on this one. I guess my expectations were too high because I felt it missed the mark.Parts of the movie took me back to the original Jungle Book movie, which isn't a bad thing, but this film seemed too derivative. I believe I understand and appreciate Disney's desire to stick with their animated film formula (love interest, cute songs, sassy characters, some evil, some action), but I was hoping that the higher-ups would have allowed more deviations to provide a little more--shall I say...""soul""--to the plot. Sadly, Disney didn't. I found the movie overly scary...Why all the skulls and glowing eyes and jagged teeth? My kids get nightmares relatively easily. I can't imagine having a 5-year-old see this on a huge flat screen. Disney, would it have been too risky to make the male lead an African or an African-American? I don't know, but isn't ""Princess"" the first Disney film with a cross-ethnic love interest? (OK, I think Disney did do a remake of Cinderella with a handsome Asian lead and Brandy). Would a ""Black"" male lead really translate into lost millions in worldwide revenue? I felt the songs were a little lacking. ""I'm Almost There"" is catchy and inspirational, but I don't anticipate people singing it the next generation as we do ""Hakuna Matata"". I applaud Disney for taking this step of faith (first Black female lead for their animated films), but I do wish they'd gone farther. I'm also glad the film did so well commercially. People really liked this film. I wish I had too.",The Princess and the Frog
247,alahna-dunbar,"Finally, A Disney Fairy Tale for Everyone",8,21 November 2013,"Oh my days, a BLACK Disney Princess? The times really are a-changing. At least, that's the message many assumed Disney wanted to convey by choosing to make its latest fairy tale princess African-American. Considering the company's less-than-representative history, questions were raised. What minority stereotypes will be reinforced, now? How will Disney treat meeting its diversity quota? As a mixed race woman, I am glad (and relieved) to say I was surprised. In fact, The Princess and the Frog appropriately pays no special attention to the ""race thing,"" at all, instead focusing on creating a fun family flick with a unique twist on a classic tale. Set in the exciting Jazz Age in New Orleans, our story- very loosely based on the German folk tale, The Frog Prince- follows Tiana (Anika Noni Rose), a workaholic girl set on earning enough money to start the restaurant her late father always wanted. When the visiting Prince Naveen of Malvonia (Bruno Campos) is turned into a frog, Tiana's desperate kiss with the amphibian turns her into a frog, too. Together the green critters journey through the bayou in order to find a way to become human again. Romance ensues (obviously). So many elements make this a captivating film: the twist of the princess becoming the frog, the jazz, the voodoo, the southern comfort food, and it still has room for a good story!What carry the movie are the script's heartwarming and well-rounded characters. Tiana is not like any other princess, not because she's black, but because she is empowered and proactive. She works hard to get her restaurant in honor of her daddy's cooking and doesn't depend on wishing on stars to get what she wants. However, it is her journey to find out what she really needs to focus on is the love of her family and community. She learns that she already has everything she needs, which is a beautiful, very Oprah Winfrey message (This makes sense, since Oprah plays the voice of Tiana's mom, Eudora). Even the arrogant Prince Naveen learns that love and family are much more important than riches. To help these two learn the lessons of life are the many animal friends they make on the way, namely Ray (Jim Cummings), your friendly Cajun neighborhood firefly. What's best about the movie is its message of bringing people together from all backgrounds. At the heart of the film, food gathers family and community regardless of class, race, or gender. Some may be dissatisfied with the way Disney idealizes the 1920s deep south, but at the end of the day, this is a family movie that tries to celebrate cultural diversity and the values of community. Because of this, and especially because this is coming from Disney, every child should see this film so they can see the beauty of diversity reflected in an equally beautiful movie.",The Princess and the Frog
248,MyWifeMorganFairchild,A positive role model for young girls!,10,12 December 2009,"I saw this movie today and was very impressed with what I saw. The art, the music, the story, everything had the making of a Disney princess classic! What I loved most about the movie was the protagonist Tiana. She is a Disney princess through and through with a refreshing modern twist! I was born in the late 80's so growing up in the 90's, I was exposed to all the classic Disney princesses of the day; Belle, Jasmine, Ariel, even the older ones, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White. What sets Tiana apart from these princesses is her strong-willed independent attitude. I love the Disney princesses I grew up on, but as I got older, I began seeing the movies in a different light and became somewhat disappointed. The princesses I knew from my childhood were all the same, they had no real ambition in life and fell head-over-heels for a prince the minute they see one, and are determined to get close to them the entire movie. They are the quintessential damsel in distress. They risk giving up their lives, friends and family, just for some guy that happens to wear a crown. This is where Tiana differs from the rest. She doesn't sit around all day waiting for a prince to come sweep her off her feet, she has goals and ambitions and a drive to succeed in life. Unlike her best friend Lottie who pines away at wanting to marry a prince, Tiana wants to open up the restaurant her father and she had dreamed of owning, so she spends her days hard at work, saving up money to make that dream a reality. It is clear from the beginning that Tiana is hardworking as the recurring theme is ""work hard for your dreams and they will come true"". Tiana frequently states during the movie of her desire to own the hippest restaurant in New Orleans and shows no interest in Prince Naveen for most of the movie. Even the end of the movie is a nice change from the overplayed prince and princess ride off on horseback into the sunset to their happily ever after. I implore parents to take their daughters to see this if they have an interest in Disney princess movies. It's a very well-thought out message which can be interpreted as ""You don't need a man (let alone a prince) to make you happy. You can achieve it on your own with hard work"".",The Princess and the Frog

Tiana is so down to earth and radiates warmth. She is a positive role model for all girls of different backgrounds. The animation and songs were brilliant. Anika Noni Rose's voice was prefect for Tiana. I cant wait to see more of her and Prince Naveen. Bring on the Princess Tiana merchandise! When this movie comes out on DVD, I am going to buy it and place it with the rest of my favorite Disney classics such as Ariel the Little Mermaid, Aladdin, The Lion King, Mulan, and Pochantas.

250,PirateWolfy,2D Animation is Back! Blue Skies and Sunshine Guaranteed!,9,8 December 2009,"The Princess and the Frog is one of the most highly anticipated films of the year. It marks Walt Disney Animation Studio's return to 2D animation, to recapture the era of amazing movies like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast – timeless tales that have reached audiences across the world. However, unlike these previous movies, The Princess and the Frog does something new. It's an updated take on the classic fairy tale, set in Jazzy New Orleans filled with witch doctors, Maldonian princes, southern lovesick daughters, Jazz playing alligators and even Cajun fireflies! In the midst of all this jazz is Disney's first black princess, Tiana, and her story.Tiana is a young girl who wants to follow her father's dream and open up her very own restaurant. She works hard, never taking a chance on Prince Charming to sweep her off her feet - she is a realist Disney 'princess' - and that makes her stand apart from the rest. And speaking of breaking from tradition, Prince Naveen is another fresh take on the classic Disney prince. He gets a fair amount of screen time and shows us that princes are more than just stuffy suits. The pair has great chemistry as frogs and their intertwining journey is full of laughs and heart tingling moments sprinkled with some good old Disney magic. Disney Animation Studios has pulled it off again; they have conjured up something fresh and new and have made it entertaining. Perhaps we can expect greater things for the future because this is a pretty good start.One of the strongest aspects of this musical is, of course, the music! Randy Newman has provided an array of songs, from bouncy piano songs to gospel to Broadway. There is no one single style of music and Newman serves up a diverse platter accompanied by stunning animation. There are several songs in the movie, perhaps more than needed, but all catchy while bringing a yet another flavor to New Orleans. The downside to these songs is that they are many, short and have the task of pushing story. Their presence feels like designated intervals, sometimes jarring up moments which could have been executed wonderfully without any song.Pacing and story are the main challenges The Princess and the Frog faces. Too much happens and it happens too fast. There is an engaging plot, obstacles are overcome through action and songs also push the story forward. This leaves us very little time for dwelling in scene. I personally think this is why the movie doesn't feel quite up to par with The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty or The Lion King – there are very few moments which rely on deeper truths or engage with characters' inner struggles and relationships. I wish the directors would have slowed down and let us have a bit more interaction rather than relying on action and songs to advance plot. Also, some crucial events relied on coincidence when they could've been worked into the plot more skillfully. Despite these minor drawbacks, the Princess and the Frog still delivers an entertaining story.Personally, I think the darker a Disney film is, the more interesting it will be. It lends a sense of reality and tells me that despite its catchy songs and humor, the movie takes itself seriously. Princess and the Frog definitely takes itself seriously. One of the main reasons I wanted to see this film was because of Dr. Facilier. He makes the film tastefully dark and shows us that even a Disney story can chill audiences. The voodoo world is intoxicating, full of intrigue and Facilier's theme song tells us he is a villain with style rivaling the likes of Jafar or Scar. However, unlike the previous villains, Facillier doesn't constantly trump the heroes after his first appearance. Villains kind of get a backseat in the movie - some people might not like this so beware! Despite its darker side, the movie is surprisingly funny and downright hilarious. Like the old classics, the movie is timeless in a way. It doesn't reference any modern pop culture. There are lots of things that made audiences laugh, some more than others. There is no one type of humor strung throughout the whole film. Without giving anything away, I would also like to say the humor gets pretty risqué at times but it's welcoming because it tells us Disney is not excluding anyone from the audience. There are some very spectacular moments of animation in this film. The characters are drawn in the 90's classic Disney style and don't have extremely stylized or exaggerated features that we've seen in later works like Emperor's New groove or Home on the Range. This blast from the past is a breath of fresh air. 2D animation is here to stay.",The Princess and the Frog
251,wises3,The Magic is back!,10,11 December 2009,"I felt like a little kid again seeing The Princess and the Frog; apparently so did most of the theater, as the crowd seemed to be generally from 8-30 years old. From the second I walked in, I realized this was a movie that was going to span groups(and it did, in the end). The other adults in line with me split almost evenly with tickets for this versus Invictus.The animation is gorgeous, the characters are absolutely unique and took me by surprise, and even the parts in trailers that I thought were going to be awful turned out to be brilliant when put into the context of the rest of the film. I haven't enjoyed Disney this much since Mulan(and vaguely, Brother Bear). The music also seems to permeate the movie; many people that review and find something wrong, find so much song and dance to be odd- but what they don't realize is that the movie itself was always intending to play off of the Jazz era it is set in. If you love music, however, you'll love this even more. The music is what gives all the more charm to it, and it pays off.The only reason that I am giving this a nine of ten is because I try to never give movies a ten unless it literally changed my life somehow. This came close, though- I was having so many flashbacks to my childhood during the Disney Renaissance. It was nostalgic for me, above all, and classic Disney animation that I will probably end up spending more money on when such moments roll around. I am most certainly going to find the soundtrack, because the music just made it so alive.Don't be misled by the word cartoon- this is a movie for everyone.",The Princess and the Frog
252,woutergaykema,More of an observation than a review,7,5 February 2018,"The one thing that really bothers me about this film is the botched message.

253,cuec,The Third Era Starts Here *minor spoilers if you haven't seen trailer*,10,12 December 2009,"2009 is swiftly coming to a close and looking at the films that have been released, it's clear that it will be remembered for one thing: The return of animation in massive appeal. Yes, animated movies are always being released and every year that's at least one that stands above the rest, but it's easy to see why the Academy is adding 2 more slots, making it 5 movies nominated for Best Animated Picture. Coraline brought a great story with visuals to match, UP brought adult themes and emotions, Ponyo marked the return of Miyazaki, Fantastic Mr. Fox challenged the modernization of the industry, and Avatar, although not released yet, is aiming to change the industry. So does The Princess and The Frog measure up to everything that's been released? Without a doubt.Disney has never been one to keep an original story intact, a look at Hercules and a basic knowledge of Greek mythology can tell you that much. The Princess and The Frog doesn't stray from this formula. The story is this: Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) is a waiter in New Orleans, working two jobs so that she can save money and buy the restaurant that her father always wanted, but never got the chance. At her best friends party, things start to go downhill and she soon finds herself unwillingly wishing upon a star. And that's when she notices the titular frog (Bruno Campos) who is actually Prince Naveen, as he's been transformed by the villain, Dr. Facilier (Keith David). He offers her the money she needs to buy the restaurant if she will kiss him. She accepts the offer, but winds up a frog herself as she's not a real princess. They decide they need to find a way to return to normal and are soon off on a quest to look for just that.You probably already know that the reason The Princess and The Frog is getting attention is due to the fact that it's Disney's return to classical animation. Although it's only been 5 years since the last hand-drawn movie was released by them, the interest is in how it compares to films such as Beauty and the Beast (1991) or The Lion King (1994) rather than the forgettable Home On the Range (2004). But comparing the films will only hinder the experience. The Princess and The Frog is a rather visual film, and will likely cause a divide in fans, much like Miyazaki's film Howl's Moving Castle (2004). The story is all there, but the plot is often advanced through it's visuals and songs, rather than only using them to set the mood.Speaking of the songs, many will be disappointed when they first learn Alan Menken is nowhere to be found in the film's score and is instead composed by the Pixar staple Randy Newman. One listen will change all that. Newman grew up in New Orleans and perfectly captures the spirit of the area. The music is perfectly placed and the only complaint is that there's definitely a desire for more when you're done watching the film.The tone of the film is light at first, but gets steadily darker until the climax. Magic has always been a staple of Disney movies like this, but never before has it taken the spotlight and been so real as Voodoo is the magic of choice, and is shown as both good and evil. If you plan on bringing children, be warned that there are some very dark images (which I fully congratulate the creative team for, as they are some of the best designs I've seen all year) conjured up by one of Disney's most terrifying villains since Maleficent.If you've been waiting for this movie since it was announced 3 years ago as The Frog Princess, you'll be glad to know it was worth the wait. As for the race issue that has somehow been blown out of proportion due to non-existent problems, Disney is able to remain historically correct without ever raising an issue; children who were born after the new millennium won't even notice it. Any other year this would take Best Animated Picture, but for now, only time will tell if it will be honored as the classic tale it is destined to become. And with movies like Rapunzel (2010) and The Snow Queen (2013) on the horizon, it looks as if the third Golden Era of Disney has finally arrived.",The Princess and the Frog
254,sparx72,This is the REAL Disney!,10,19 January 2010,"Just watched this yesterday and I absolutely loved it! This is how I remember Disney from my youth. Lots of good music, and a good, happy feeling all the way through. Combined with the 2D, shell shaded feel similar to movies like The Lion King, this truly feels like a Disney production.The story is good, although not very hard to predict. But there are still some twists to how you'd normally think the story should be (without spoiling anything), which is very nice.The music is the best thing about this movie, especially if you like New Orleans music. Disney really did a good job here. It might not top some of the tunes from The Lion King, which have become quite famous, but its close.The second best thing is the characters! There is a wide array of stereotypical characters, but they all fit the story very well, and none of them become boring or irritating. Brilliant ideas such as the alligator that just wants to play trumpet on a streamliner, and the firefly who's in love with a shining star just fit right into the story.All in all, an absolute must-see for everyone who loves the magic of Disney!",The Princess and the Frog
