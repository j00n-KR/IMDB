0,MartinHafer,A weird and wonderful dark comedy,8,12 July 2006,"Wow--this is one strange and inspired comedy that is so unlike any other I can think of! Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn play aging childhood friends who grow to absolutely hate each other. Both are shallow and vain and both feel 100% in the right for hating the other. The awfulness of their relationship culminates in Meryl stealing away Goldie's husband--just because she COULD! Years pass and Meryl is a fabulously wealthy actress--who STILL down deep is vain and self-centered. Back comes the previously fat and unattractive Goldie but instead, she is thin and looks even younger than she looked decades ago! It looks as if she went to the greatest plastic surgeons in the world and said ""here's a million bucks--gimme the works!!"". Goldie is back to rub in her good looks and also to steal back wayward hubby Bruce Willis--not because she even wants him but because she CAN! Well, Meryl is worried about losing her man but she's much more upset because Goldie looks so much better than her! So worried that she goes to a strange witch-like lady (Isabella Rosselini) who tells her she has a magic substance that can give her eternal youth!! Despite the cost, the vain lady gladly pays and drinks the formula--and immediately feels the wonderful effects.When she arrives at home, there is Goldie and Bruce to finish their plan--which is to kill Meryl and leave! Well, here is where the movie and special effects get REALLY, REALLY weird. Meryl is shoved down the steps and obviously breaks her neck. Goldie and Bruce are celebrating as Meryl wakes up and is alive--but, her head is on completely backwards!! After a little adjustment, she's back to how she was and the formula was an apparent success! So then she attacks Goldie with a shotgun--blowing her across the room into a fountain. A few moments later, Goldie gets up and walks about with a huge hole in her body--so big you can see right through her!! It's now obvious that she, too, has used the formula! Well, after some more senseless punching and slapping, the fight is over--they really can't kill the other no matter how hard they try. Plus, for some inexplicable reason, they decide to bury the hatchet and become friends again. Now, their immediate goal is to use Bruce's expertise as a plastic surgeon to make them look better--spackling in the hole in Goldie and being ready in case they needed touching up! Bruce has had enough and they try to force his to take the formula and be their permanent fixer-upper! But, despite their efforts and those of the weird little group with the potions, he escapes and vows to never see them again nor use the formula.At this point, the film is wrapping up and the film ends with one of the funniest and visually impressive endings in film history. Instead of elaborating, you just need to see it for yourself.The film has terrific over-the-top performances by Goldie and Meryl and Bruce plays an appropriately creeped out guy who just wants to be left alone!! The script is fresh and funny and provides a lot of amazing laughs. On top of everything, the biggest star are the special effects--amazing and so important to the movie.",Death Becomes Her
1,Leofwine_draca,"Effective satire, but that's about it",5,23 December 2015,"The reason I enjoy DEATH BECOMES HER is for the cutting way it explores the obsession with anti-ageing in America (and particularly Los Angeles) and the increasingly desperate efforts by women (and men) to combat it. This is a film which takes plastic surgery to new extremes when a couple of rival women discover a magical immortality serum and use it to devastating effect.Other than the spot-on satire, it's fair to say that this film really isn't all that good. The goofy slapstick comedy feels forced and the plot is so limited that it barely sustains the running time. Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn are both given free reign to ham things up as much as is humanly possible, while Bruce Willis is miscast in a slightly desperate comedic turn. The supporting acts of Isabella Rossellini and Ian Ogilvy are better, but given little to work with.Watching this film over twenty years after it was made, it becomes apparent that it was designed as a special effects showcase in which human bodies are turned into cartoon-style creations with all manner of outlandish violence. Unfortunately, the CGI isn't all that great, and some of it looks really, really awful these days; the bit with the backwards head is the film's nadir. To say that it's dated is an understatement...",Death Becomes Her
2,SnoopyStyle,great special effects,5,1 February 2016,"In 1978, Broadway star Madeline Ashton (Meryl Streep) invites rival Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn) backstage and steals her plastic surgeon fiancé Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis). Madeline marries him sending Helen on a downward spiral. Seven years later, Helen is obese and mad with thoughts of revenge. Seven more years later, Madeline's career has faded. Ernest is a drunk with a failed work life. Their marriage is on the rocks. They are invited to Helen's party celebrating the release of her book Forever Young. Helen is shockingly young and beautiful. Mysterious Lisle Von Rhuman (Isabella Rossellini) sells Madeline a magic potent. Helen convinces Ernest to kill Madeline but it goes wrong.These characters are all pretty ugly. They do sad ugly things. I would rather not spend time with this trio. However, the special effects are great and they're done in interesting ways. I wish the characters get some rewrites to make one of them with rooting interest. It's fun to see Goldie Hawn get shot with a hole in her stomach but it's not that interesting as a story element.",Death Becomes Her
3,mark.waltz,Now a Warning! Meryl Streep is funny!,7,17 July 2013,"Who'd think after ""The French Lt.'s Woman"", ""Sophie's Choice"" and ""Out of Africa"" that Meryl Streep could be funny? The ""Queen of 80's accents"" decided to change her image a bit and did some comedies like ""She-Devil"" and ""Postcards From the Edge"", throwing in this rambunctious farce for good measure. She is one of the most vane actresses on Broadway and in Hollywood, starring in a horrendous musical version of ""Sweet Bird of Youth"", comically called ""Songbird!"". (You know an explanation point had to be in there somewhere...) The musical is so bad that after walking out of the Broadway show into the mid-town Manhattan rain, the playbill with Streep's photo on it ends up in the middle of the street. Up there with ""The Producer's"" ""Springtime For Hitler"" and ""The Tall Guy's"" ""Elephant Man"" spoof, ""Songbird!"" takes spoofing of bad musical theater to a deliciously low level of tackiness. From the outrageous musical opening that lampoons bad Broadway musicals (of which there were plenty of in the 1970's and early 80's) to the murder mystery parody she stars in for which overweight rival Goldie Hawn rewinds her murder scene over and over again just to smile in glee at the thought of the woman who stole her fiancée (Bruce Willis, made up to look like Martin Mull) being murdered. Hawn, once a thin frump, blew up to the size of a hippopotamus, living off of cake frosting and vowing revenge. Streep has grown older, goes to the opening of an envelope for publicity purposes, and is stunned at one such event when she runs into the now beautifully svelte Hawn whom she is sure will seek revenge to get Willis (whom she hates!) back. Murder is plotted, deaths occur, and before you know it, thanks to a mysterious potion, Streep is looking 20 years younger. But with this beauty coming at a price, Streep, Hawn and Willis find their fates tied together in a way they never thought could be.Brilliant special effects and outrageous performances make this comedy one of the best modern farces. The cast is obviously having a blast, and the spoof of Hollywood vanity by Hollywood itself, is an ironic delight. To see the beautifully zany Hawn not only in an obvious fat suit but her face made up to look enormous as well is one of the best visual sights of recent times. Isabella Rossellini has a wonderful smaller role as the guru/devil woman who makes references to allegedly dead stars who simply vanished off the face of the earth thanks to her potion. A few of them appear in a party sequence which makes you wonder how many of these narcissistic people may have suffered similar fates to what happened to Streep and Hawn. Director Sydney Pollack has a hysterical cameo as Streep's doctor after she falls down the stairs. (""Oopsy!"") ""General Hospital's"" John Ingle (the final Edward Quartermain) makes another brief splash as the minister in the final scene, describing one of the characters with such outrageous dramatics that Hawn and Streep couldn't help but take notice.As directed by Robert Zemickis, every detail is perfect, even if the theme is extremely mean-spirited, and totally unafraid of its cruelty. This is one of those films that you can't believe the creative mind could come up with, so half the laughs are more out of shock, and that adds even more amusement to the proceedings. Some of the sound effects (one involving a fall down the stairs) will make your spine shiver. At times, the film seems to enjoy slamming the Hollywood ego, but there are other times when it also seems to be full of ego itself. In retrospect, it makes the balance between sanity and insanity over aging an obsession that grows into an evil fungus inside these character's hearts that is as self-destructive as drugs and alcohol. Spoofing various situations that real people only get hints of through all those outrageously pretentious award shows really makes you think what a sad life some celebrities must lead when they can't separate their own public image and real personality. Throw in an exit line at the very end that is right up there with Joe E. Brown's response to Jack Lemmon at the end of ""Some Like It Hot"".",Death Becomes Her
4,claudio_carvalho,The Living Dead in Beverly Hills,7,3 September 2015,"In 1978, in Broadway, the decadent and narcissist actress Madeline Ashton (Meryl Streep) is performing Songbird, based on Tennessee Williams' Sweet Bird of Youth. Then she receives her rival Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn), who is an aspiring writer, and her fiancé Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis), who is a plastic surgeon, in her dressing-room. Soon Menville calls off his commitment with Helen and marries Madeline. Seven years later, Helen is obese in a psychiatric hospital and obsessed in seeking revenge on Madeline. In 1992, the marriage of Madeline and Menville is finished and he is no longer a surgeon but an alcoholic caretaker. Out of the blue, they are invited to a party where Helen will release her novel Forever Young and Madeline goes to a beauty shop. The owner gives a business card of the specialist in rejuvenation Lisle Von Rhuman (Isabella Rossellini) to her. When the envious Madeline sees Helen thin in a perfect shape, she decides to seek out Lisle and buys a potion to become young again. Further, she advises that Madeline must take care of her body. Meanwhile Helen seduces Menville and they plot a scheme to kill Madeline. When Madeline comes home, she has an argument Menville and he pushes her from the staircase. She breaks her neck but becomes a living dead. When Helen arrives at Menville's house expecting that Madeline is dead, she is murdered by Madeline. But she also becomes a living dead and they conclude they need Menville to help them to maintain their bodies. But Menville wants to leave them. ""Death Becomes Her"" is an American black comedy with excellent special effects even after twenty-three years after the release and great cast. The trash storyline is strange and original and the black humor may not be pleasant for everyone. But there are funny and witty quotes and situations and this film has not aged. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Morte Lhe Cai Bem"" (""Death Fits Well to Her"")",Death Becomes Her
5,Sleepin_Dragon,Comedy that will crack you up.,8,15 January 2018,"Helen loses her man, and control over her life, due to the glamour of the atractive Madeline Ashton. Fixated on revenge, Helen discovers a secret that will change her life forever, but beauty comes at a price.It's hard to think that Death become her was made back in 1992, it's so fresh and current. The humour is wonderfully witty, the delivery is subtle. A great trio in Streep, Hawn and Willis, each has impeccable comic timing, they combine so well. I'm struck by just how glamorous Meryl Streep was, perfect for this role. Some truly funny lines throughout, it's a shame the comedy horror genre has all but died out, Death becomes her serves as a reminder at just how good the genre can be.Big thumbs up from me.",Death Becomes Her
6,classicsoncall,"""Screw the natural law!""",6,21 April 2021,"What could have been an effective satire is brought down by the extreme parody of it's principal characters in a film that centers on the obsession with youth and maintaining a glamorous appearance. Goldie Hawn in a fat suit looked like Jabba the Hutt, as her character, Fat Helen went into a deep funk over losing a potential husband to Madeline Ashton (Meryl Streep). After both discover a literal fountain of youth courtesy of self styled goddess Lisle von Rhuman (Isabella Rossellini), the women plot each other's downfall with Dr. Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis) a helpless hostage between the affections of the two rivals. About the only clever thing in this picture were the creative special effects, notwithstanding the grotesque fat suit; Madeline's contortions with that Exorcist inspired head on backwards was disorienting to watch, along with the camera tricks that de-aged her following the special elixir treatment. With a proactive, self defense murder planned by Helen in concert with the goofy Dr. Menville, the story gets bogged down in total silliness to such an extent I wished it was over about twenty minutes before the final curtain. For Bruce Willis fans, don't expect to witness those familiar facial tics and grimaces that are a staple of his dramatic, action-hero roles. Here he's wasted in a thankless role that quite frankly, can be said for his co-stars as well.",Death Becomes Her
7,gavin6942,Zemeckis Knows Genre,7,3 April 2016,"When a woman learns of an immortality treatment, she sees it as a way to outdo her long-time rival.This film was intended to be a sequel to the ""Tales From the Script"" television show, and although the TFTC name is not attached, you still get a strong sense of the humor we have come to expect. David Koepp and Martin Donovan (who last worked together on ""Apartment Zero"") had intended to write a few short films, like an anthology, but this story just grew... and Robert Zemeckis added his own brand of humor, with the dark side of Hollywood bubbling to the surface.Along with Zemeckis comes some of his associates. That includes Dean Cundey, the cinematographer who started on low budget horror, then made John Carpenter's work look great, before moving on to the high-profile films of Zemeckis. And also producer Steve Starkey, who came up from the ""Star Wars"" films. Zemeckis is sort of the lesser-celebrated member of a triumvirate with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, but perhaps he should in many ways be more celebrated... his range and aesthetic are impressive.There is no denying Robert Zemeckis is really a master of genre. He takes what could be a niche and makes it mainstream. ""Back to the Future"" is loved by all, not just science fiction nerds. And ""Death Becomes Her"" could have been horror, but with Zemeckis at the helm it was more mainstream, and is now classified as ""fantasy / comedy"" -- not even horror at all, despite the themes! Although Meryl Streep was great (as always), she has said that it ""was like being at the dentist"" having to work in such a way to accommodate the special effects. She vowed never to work in such a film again, and for the most part I think she has stayed true to this vow. Which brings up an interesting divide between the actors of Streep's level (constant Oscar nominees) and those who appear in genre films again and again. Maybe Oscar acting is not better, but merely employs a different skill set? Speaking of Oscars, ""Death Becomes Her"" won the Academy Award for Visual Effects. That is so well-deserved. Anyone who watches this film should be impressed by what they were able to do. Why is it that today (2016) we spend millions of dollars to make things look like animation, but already in 1992 they had perfected a way of making it look like heads were falling off and holes were being blown through people? We are regressing! Scream Factory comes through with a Collector's Edition blu-ray. Although the features on the disc are a bit scant for a collector's edition, they were able to put together a series of interviews to make a retrospective. Streep and Goldie Hawn did not participate (not surprisingly), but Zemeckis did, which is really quite a coup. And David Koepp! And legendary cinematographer Dean Cundey, who had come with Zemeckis from ""Back to Future""! Fans of the film who want to know a bit more about what went into this picture are strongly encouraged to pick it up.",Death Becomes Her
8,lee_eisenberg,"Woman, thou art ""twisted"" and ""hole'd""",10,10 June 2006,"In some ways, Goldie Hawn would seem like the only cast member who should be involved with the zany ""Death Becomes Her"", given that Meryl Streep is best known for serious roles and Bruce Willis is best known for action movies (not to mention that director Robert Zemeckis is best known for the likes of ""Forrest Gump""). But believe you me, everyone does a great job! Portraying two women vying for a man - and going to literally any length to succeed - this is one movie sure to blow your mind. Of course, the best part is what happens to Hawn and Streep. How anyone came up with that I'll never figure out! And then they fight! Ha! Overall, this is just a really cool flick. Whether we interpret it as a jab at Hollywood (and movie stars' obsessions with their looks) or as plain old wacky fun, it's still something else. Also starring are Isabella Rosselini as the woman who gives people the potion, and Sydney Pollack as a physician who gets a really, REALLY big surprise.I guess that you could say that Meryl Streep's character was ""neck-in-neck"" with certain other parties, and that Goldie Hawn's character had a hole in more places than her head!",Death Becomes Her
9,jboothmillard,Death Becomes Her,7,28 June 2006,"From Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump), this is a fantastic black fantasy comedy with great stars and story. Basically Madeline Ashton (Golden Globe nominated Meryl Streep) finds Lisle Von Rhoman (Isabella Rossellini, you see her great arse and cleavage) who has a potion to make her younger, stop ageing, and avoid death. When she gets home, her man Dr. Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis) has plans to kill her and be with Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn). But obviously the potion rescues Madeline from a broken neck, and she is still walking, with her head twisted backwards. Soon after, Helen also takes the potion, and avoids a large gun shot in her stomach. Towards the end, Ernest can't handle being with either of them, and after they co-operate, and Ernest finally dies (naturally), it ends with them finally falling apart, but Madeline still gets a good final line. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Effects. Very good!",Death Becomes Her
10,BA_Harrison,The effects have aged well.,6,2 November 2021,"Death Becomes Her is a macabre comedic farce, which takes cruel swipes at the rich and famous, for whom staying young and good looking is worth taking extreme measures. Goldie Hawn plays author Helen Sharp, who loses her fiancé, plastic surgeon Dr. Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis), to glamorous actress Madeline Ashton (Meryl Streep, looking every inch the star). Seven years later, Madeline and Ernest are married, and Helen is angry, bitter, and overweight. Another seven years later, Helen has shed the pounds and looks a million dollars, but is still looking for revenge, even though Ernest and Madeline's marriage is on the rocks; she convinces Ernest to kill Madeline, unaware that the fading actress has recently partaken in a special potion - purchased from the beautiful and mysterious Lisle Von Rhuman (Isabella Rossellini) - that not only reverses the ageing process, but also means that she cannot die.What follows is ghoulish knockabout silliness, in which Madeline is indeed killed (pushed down the stone stairs of her mansion), but refuses to stay still despite numerous injuries, including a broken neck. Things get even crazier when Madeline blasts Helen in the stomach with a shotgun only to discover that Helen is also immortal, having drunk the same magic potion years earlier. Realising the futility of their violence, the women call a truce and try to convince Ernest to take the potion so that he will always be there to patch up their bodies.With slick direction from Robert Zemeckis, who uses state-of-the-art special effects to depict the damage inflicted on both women, Death Becomes Her is visually impressive and deliciously dark, but despite top-notch production values and game performances from its A-list stars, the film doesn't quite succeed thanks to a lack of decent laughs. It's mildly amusing in its absurdity, of course, but Zemeckis should have taken the craziness a few steps further for his film to be wholly effective, and ensured that the script delivered much sharper and wittier dialogue. Something this demented in concept should be eminently quotable, but nothing really sticks in the mind. The film's most memorable moment is a visual gag: the inclusion of Elvis, Marilyn Monroe, Andy Warhol and James Dean amongst the guests at Lisle's party.",Death Becomes Her
11,moonspinner55,Comic-book ghoulishness,6,22 November 2001,"After a sharp, smartly and amusingly satirical first act, ""Death Becomes Her"" takes a dive and never recovers (and the hastily-refilmed ending certainly doesn't help; it's too transparently rushed). After two female rivals have each drunk a potion that will keep them young forever, they are killed and come back as the living dead...and continue to primp and fuss like pageant contestants. Bruce Willis plays a genial doctor who gets caught in the middle, and while Bruce is surprisingly adept at playing the milquetoast, it's a completely thankless part (he just stands there reacting, his mouth open in surprise). The picture does look good--too good. It's overproduced and yet doesn't flow with a smooth continuity (the way slick, expensive movies often do). Instead, the film is jumbled and frenetic, and doesn't seem to have a point. However, the first 45 minutes are a hoot, and in these early scenes Meryl Streep does some high comedy worth seeing. A mixed-bag. **1/2 from ****",Death Becomes Her
12,paul_haakonsen,A touch of youth and eternal life...,6,23 July 2017,"I remember watching this movie back in the mid 1990's, give or take, and do recall it as being an entertaining movie. So I took the time to sit down and watch it again in 2017.And let me just start out by saying that having aged 25 years has done nothing to the movie, because it is every bit as entertaining and enjoyable now as it was back then. So one might speculate whether or not the potion that thwarts aging and restores youth have been given to the movie as well...The story is about the rivalry between two friends; Helen Sharp (played by Goldie Hawn) and Madeline Ashton (played by Meryl Streep). Helen is engaged to be married to Ernest Menville (played by Bruce Willis) when Madeline swoops in an steal him away. Ernest and Madeline become married, but the years of marriage wedges an emotional separation between them, and during these years Helen is down on her luck and harbors a strong resentment towards Madeline all these years. 12 years later, Helen walks back into the lives of Ernest and Madeline, and things are taking a very unexpected turn...It is a combination of storyline, acting performances and special effects that keep this movie fresh and up to date. Yes, even while the movie is from 1992, the special effects are quite good and still do manage to stand up to the effects of today.The music score for the movie was quite good, as it should be of course at the hands of Alan Silvestri.Director Robert Zemeckis managed to turn writers Martin Donovan and David Koepp's story into a very enjoyable movie on the screen.If you haven't already seen ""Death Becomes Her"", then I can strongly recommend that you find the time to do so, should you happen to get the chance, because this is a rather nice movie.",Death Becomes Her
13,Hey_Sweden,A lively showcase for the actors.,6,5 April 2019,"Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn welcome the opportunities to really tear into the scenery, in this dark comedy / fantasy from Robert Zemeckis that goes heavy on the eye-popping visual effects. Ultimately, it's a ode to Hollywood vanity brought on with a Looney Tunes sort of fervour. At its best, it's crazy enough to have the viewer laughing appreciably.Meryl and Goldie play a successful actress and writer (respectively) whose fates were intertwined when Goldie's plastic surgeon husband Ernest (Bruce Willis) has his head promptly turned by Meryl. But the story proper really doesn't kick off until mysterious beauty Lisle (Isabella Rossellini) presents Meryl with a potion that will keep her youth and beauty intact, no matter what other damage is done to the body physically. Meryl and Goldie (who make a great team) must roll with the punches, so to speak, when their attempts to be ""diagnosed"" spell a recipe for disaster. (There is a very funny, unbilled cameo by film director Sydney Pollack as a Beverly Hills doctor.)Granted, this film IS fun in a mischievous, ghoulish manner; it's just too much fun when Goldie and Meryl, who both have parts coming off of them, face off Mano a Mano. Essentially, the two ladies ARE this movie, playing everything to the hilt, and never backing off or giving an inch. Willis, as the man caught between them, gets to be utterly nebbishy and on the verge of hysteria throughout. That said, he at least has something of a moral high ground over the two ladies, since he doesn't take his looks quite as seriously.Dick Smith does some of the makeup in this zany collection of physical gags and visuals coordinated by Ken Ralston.Best of all is the ending, which is just a hoot.Six out of 10.",Death Becomes Her
14,Doylenf,Wickedly funny comedy/satire with awesome special effects...,6,25 December 2006,"The fact that it's entirely unpredictable and has some of the funniest and bitchiest bits of snappy dialog between two women that you're ever likely to hear, makes DEATH BECOMES HER the solidly entertaining film that it is. Not that it's perfect, by any means. It's a totally implausible and impossible bit of plotting that is all trickery and depends heavily on special effects to get its points across.But when MERYL STREEP and GOLDIE HAWN decide to become deadly enemies over their love for doctor BRUCE WILLIS, well--anything can happen, and it does! The sight of Streep falling down the stairs and emerging with her head on backwards is no small feat among the film's dazzling use of special effects. And the sight of Hawn with a huge hole through her middle section but completely ambulatory and even more--still alive and kicking--is something else.It's all because both women, obsessed with a fear of aging, have taken a potion recommended by ISABELLA ROSSELINNI that promises to keep them both looking gorgeous for eternity. The script has a lot to say about vanity (men and women both), and is especially timely in view of today's preoccupation with holding onto youth at any cost.MERYL STREEP proves that she unquestionably has a talent for comedy that she seldom demonstrates with all her concentration on drama. And, of course, GOLDIE HAWN excels at this sort of thing. Both of them have meaty material to work with and they deliver the goods. Interesting to see Willis in something other than his ""Die Hard"" mode.Very original and some of it is wickedly funny, but it may not be for all tastes.",Death Becomes Her
15,poolandrews,"""This is life's ultimate cruelty, it offers us the taste of youth & vitality & makes us witness our own decay."" Fantastic black comedy/horror film.",9,24 July 2005,"Death Becomes Her starts in 1978 where actress Madeline Ashton (Meryl Streep) is headlining a Broadway show. One of Madeline's friends an author named Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn) & her fiancé a talented plastic surgeon named Dr. Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis) visits her backstage. Before long Madeline has stolen Ernest from Helen & they are married. Years later & Helen is an overweight emotional mess who blames Madeline for all her troubles & sets out to gain revenge. Now living together in a mansion in Beverly Hills Madeline is ageing fast & Ernest is nothing but a glorified undertaker these days & deeply unhappy with his life & his marriage to Madeline. One morning Madeline receives a invitation from Helen to the launch party of her latest book. The same morning Madeline is told that she cannot have anymore of her surgical beauty treatments for 6 months but is also secretly told to see a woman named Lisal Von Rhoman (Isabella Rossellini) who may be able to help. At the party Helen turns up & is beautiful, looks young & has a terrific body. Madeline is jealous & Ernest is attracted to her, Helen starts to manipulate Madeline & Ernest to set her plans in motion. After Madeline's younger lover Dakota (Adam Storke) dumps her she decides to visit Lisal. Madeline drives to the address she was given, a huge Gothic cross between a mansion & castle where Lisal gives her a potion which reverses the ageing process & will make her forever young. Lisal gives Madeline a specific warning to care of her body as they will be together for a long time. Meanwhile Ernest & Helen plot to murder Madeline. Soon after Madeline falls down the stairs & breaks her neck but doesn't die, Ernest touches her up with spray paint as her body starts to decay & fall to pieces. Helen turns up & when Madeline discovers the plot to kill her she grabs a shotgun & blasts Helen but she too doesn't stay dead for long...Co-produced & directed by Robert Zemeckis I think Death Becomes Her is a wonderful black comedy which has become a personal favourite of mine. The script by Martin Donovan & David Koepp is fast paced, dark, very funny, original & presents the most bizarre love triangle in film history! The Hollywood satire hits the nail on the head & is clearly there for all to see with vain, rich & famous celebrities living obsession with looking young, thin & beautiful. I really like all the characters in Death Becomes Her especially Bruce Willis as the dumb founded man caught in the middle & Goldie Hawn as the vicious scheming jilted lover, although everyone has personality. Full of witty one-liners, great visual gags & some nice irony thrown into the mix Death Becomes Her is a tremendously entertaining film that I have seen many times & enjoyed each & every time. I think the climax is terrific as well & round the film off perfectly. Director Zemeckis has fun with creating some memorable CGI effects, Streep with her head twisted backwards & my personal favourite Hawn with a huge hole in her stomach you can look right through. The violence is more slapstick in style than sadistic & contain little in the way of actual explicit blood or gore. Having said that there is a fair amount of bad language throughout so maybe it's not suitable for very young children. The acting is great from everyone Willis & Hawn in particular as I've mentioned, everyone has good on screen chemistry in my humble opinion. Oh, am I the only one who thinks Goldie Hawn looks fantastic & very sexy in this, even with a huge hole in her stomach?! Technically death Becomes Her is great as well, well for around $55,000,000 that's the least I'd expect. From the wonderful looking & atmospheric sets to the special effects to the cinematography where Zemeckis thankfully uses lots of nice long fluid smooth elegant camera movements & pans rather than ugly quick cuts & zooms that tend to be the norm these days. I love Death Becomes Her, it's one of my favourite family horror/fantasy films that's incredibly funny, works as satire very well & has a top-notch cast who are hopefully having as much fun as I was, it has some terrific effects that aren't quite as convincing as todays mega budget films but they are striking & stay with you. I don't really have a bad word to say about this film! Highly recommended, so what are you waiting for? If you've never seen it make sure you do as soon as possible & if you have make sure you remind yourself of it's brilliantness soon!",Death Becomes Her
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Dark comedy doesn't get much darker than this,6,21 June 2004,"This is one of the better dark comedies out there, and it's definitely one of the darkest I've ever seen. It's basic theme revolves around the many people who dream of being young forever; many people, just in their late 30's or early 40's think about that, so It's a pretty appropriate subject(especially to make fun of, given the ludicrousness of the very idea). Most people around that age will probably feel with one of the two female main characters, which are both obsessed with their looks. The plot is pretty good, definitely something people who feel older than they are, or at least think they look older than they should, can relate to. The acting is all good, especially by each of the three main characters. The characters are well-written, humorous, and credible. I really liked Willis as the nervous, weak goofy-looking husband. Both Streep and Hawn portray their superficial, slightly psychotic characters well too. The humor is pretty much as dark as it can possibly get, without involving stuff as bizarre as is often seen in a typical Monty Python sketch. However, something seems to be missing; maybe it's because there is hardly any character who is just slightly likable, maybe it's because the film mainly just uses the plot to put in dark jokes, and never really tries to transcend the standard dark comedy. It's too bad, really, as it has a very good point. It's just hard to find if you don't look for it. The film drowns its moral in an ocean of dark jokes and gags, and, don't get me wrong, the jokes are great, I laughed almost constantly; but it just seems like a missed opportunity to state the good point the film has. If anyone ever makes another movie about this, that just looks slightly like this it will instantly be tagged a rip-off, and I doubt that they could possibly make an equally great dark comedy like this again. If it's too much like the film, it'll be called a rip-off; if it's too little like it, it'll be called an inferior film using the same basic theme. All in all, a pretty good film, that only makes me wish the director had either concentrated entirely on making a film about the theme, or on making a dark comedy, without any important, noticeable theme. It apparently can't be both; dark comedies and truly good themes/morals don't go along too well. I recommend the film to fans of dark comedies and/or people who can relate to the subject, and who have the stomach for it(the film, not the theme!). 6/10",Death Becomes Her
17,view_and_review,Extreme Frenemies,7,11 April 2020,"I did a simple equation before plopping down to watch this movie. Meryl Streep + I've heard of the movie + free - Goldie Hawn - Bruce Willis in a non-action movie = OK, I'll watch.I haven't seen Goldie Hawn in much, but the little I have seen of her I wasn't a fan of. She brought it this movie.Helen (Goldie Hawn) and Madeline Asthon (Meryl Streep) are hardcore frenemies. They fake happiness everytime they see each other. Madeline is the more successful and also the more cruel. When Helen introduced her fiance, Dr. Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis), to Madeline, Madeline proceeded to take Ernest right from under Helen's nose. That sent Helen spiraling downward into being an overweight cat lady with deep psychological issues. She would plot her revenge though, even if it would take her years to enact her plan. After all, revenge is a dish best served cold.""Death Becomes Her"" was unique, funny, and an early implementation of CGI. It was crude by today's standards, but hey! It was 28 years ago. I enjoyed Hawn and Streep together. It was like they were made for the roles. The movie itself was refreshing being that it took the frenemy concept to the extreme and had fun with it. And it's always great when a fun movie is also fun for the audience.",Death Becomes Her
18,neil-476,Entertaining and mildly groundbreaking,7,18 September 2012,"Madeline (Meryl Streep) and Helen (Goldie Hawn) play two old ""friends"" - ostensibly friends, they are actually viciously envious of, and aggressively competitive towards each other, as demonstrated by Madeline marrying Helen's plastic surgeon fiancé Ernest (Bruce Willis), the trauma of which sends Helen to mental hospital for 7 years. By this time Madeline's career is more or less over and Ernest is alcoholic, their marriage a misery-soaked sham. Depressed over the depredations of age, Madeline obtains an elixir of youth and immortality (unknown to her, Helen has already taken this). This coincides with a plot by Helen and Ernest to kill her, a plot which would have been successful were she not now immortal. In retaliation, Madeline blasts a hole in Helen with a shotgun. Both women discover that the advice they were given - to take care of their bodies - was particularly apposite given that the bodies retain all the damage done to them while the woman themselves remain alive.This very black comedy, directed by Robert Zemeckis, has a wonderful premise, an excellent story, two lead actresses having a ball, Bruce Willis cast and performing against type, and some terrific special effects, mostly concerning the dreadful damage caused to the bodies of the two women - this film illustrated just how good a tool, CGI could be when used well.Most of all, this film is fun!",Death Becomes Her
19,AlsExGal,The moral of the story is for boomer girls to act their age...,8,21 March 2020,"... and following that advice in 1992 or now would get you ignored, dumped, treated as somebody invisible. The USA does not now nor has it ever had any use for older women. But it's still a great black comedy.It's about the lifelong rivalry between mousey Helen Sharpe (Goldie Hawn) and actress Madeline Ashton (Meryl Streep). The film opens in 1978 when both are 36. Madeline is already seeing lines and wrinkles and thinking about plastic surgery. So up pops her lifelong rival, Helen, to introduce her to her fiance, plastic surgeon Dr. Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis). This is a kind of test for Helen, because if Madeline cannot steal Ernest, then she can truly trust him. Of course Madeline steals Ernest, marries him, he fixes her all up with his surgical skills, and this rejuvenates her career. Meanwhile Helen becomes a recluse and gains an enormous amount of weight.Fast forward to 1992. Ernest has become a drunk thanks to his despair over Madeline's affairs, and now works as a mortician since alcohol has made his hands too shaky to continue to operate. Father time is gradually pushing Ernest's earlier work out of the way with Madeline, at age 50, reaching the limits of what professionals can do. And then she sees Helen at a dinner party, now looking sleek and glamorous, promoting her new book on how to stay young. Nothing groundbreaking - just diet and exercise.And so this and the fact that a young lover Maddy turns to is found cheating on her, and basically ridicules her for trying to be with him at her age, makes Madeline turn to extreme and supernatural measures. But there are consequences, and that is where this turns into a hilarious black comedy. You might wonder why these two women - the actresses play off of each other brilliantly by the way - would end up fighting over mousy mortician Menville, or what is left of him, at age 50. It is not really Ernest that matters to them at all , he is just a symbol for this deep seated rivalry that has taken on a life of its own.With Bruce Willis primarily being known for action films these past 30 years, this role gives him a chance to show he still had it when it came to comedy after Moonlighting, plus he could do pathos pretty well too. Meryl Streep has always been the Bette Davis of our time, and is still one of the few actresses who gets good roles into her 70s. Yes she really can do comedy too.With Isabella Rossellini satirizing her role as a cosmetics spokesperson and director Sydney Pollack in a hilarious cameo role as an ER doctor, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it.

22,Aaron1375,"Some laughs here and there, but I would prefer death than an eternity of watching movies like this.",4,10 June 2010,"I never really cared for this movie all that much. For some reason this film, I believe, went on to win an academy award for special effects for reasons I do not know. Are the effects good? Sort of, but I did not really find them all that special even for the time this film was released. Then again, a lot of movies that win special effects awards are nothing really all that great in a lot of cases and there is usually something that is a lot better that either gets snubbed from Oscar consideration all together are loses out to the more mediocre film. I remember this happened when in 1995 ""True Lies"" lost out to ""Forrest Gump"". This film is about three unpleasant people. A husband and wife who really are not getting along all that well and a lady from the woman's past who is fighting over the husband character for reasons unknown as she does not seem to care to much for him either. Bruce Willis plays the husband and is not really in typical Bruce Willis mode. He is playing a bit of a clueless dork in this one. Well one of the females is experiencing the aging process and is offered a chance to reverse it by a strange lady in a mansion. Well she gets more than she bargains for as the stuff she gets does in fact reverse aging and stops it, but if something happens to her body there could be grave consequences. Meanwhile, the other woman played by Goldie Hawn, is trying to convince the husband to take care of his wife once and for all. Overall, I have to say I found the movie a bit dull and to long considering the plot. However, there are some good parts here and there usually involve some horrible maiming of the two competing ladies. Another problem though is that all three character are very unlikable and it kind of drags the movie down when you find all the main characters irritating. Streep plays the wife and she gripes to much, Goldie is playing a darker character than I am used to, and Willis is a dork as stated before. Just not my kind of movie as it did not resonate well with me, it could be for someone else though.",Death Becomes Her
23,The_Void,Classy black comedy,8,24 July 2005,"Much like the nightmarish classic, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane; Death Becomes Her represents the on-screen meeting of two it's heyday's biggest female stars, in this case appearing in the form of Goldie Hawn and Meryl Streep. However, in spite of it's two enormously annoying leads, this film works as a thought-provoking drama, a tour de force of outstanding special effects and a pitch black comedy. While the film has several fundamental flaws, director Robert Zemeckis manages to mask them adequately by way of lots of ingenuity with the plot, his two strong leads and the flashy special effects. The story sees an aging actress (Streep) and her mortal enemy; the same woman whose husband she stole (Hawn) taking a magical potion that will allow them to stay young for all eternity. This puts the unfortunate man of the story (Bruce Willis) in a very miserable situation, as he finds himself in the middle of the feud between the two ladies, which worsens still when it turns out the women need his skills with plastic surgery to stay looking good.The story allows for some very striking special effects, as the two female leads are pushed down stairs, have their heads turned 360 degrees, get blown apart with a shotgun and more. While the story could have done with being a little more expansive; it basically holds the story together well, and always ensures that the film is lots of fun. The leads obviously enjoy themselves also, and while I'm certainly not a fan of the female stars; both fit their characters excellently. Bruce Willis is the standout of the cast for me. He takes on a role that is the exact opposite of the one in Die Hard that made him famous, and proves that he can do more than just standard action fare. The beautiful Isabella Rossellini rounds off a nice cast; and she is always a pleasure to see. The humour mostly emancipates from the neurotic characters that Streep and Hawn have been given, and seeing the two bitch at each other is usually entertaining. The film is full of comments on society, the never-ending quest for beauty and the female persona in general; but on top of all that, and more importantly, it makes for top class entertainment.

24,SimonJack,Be careful what you wish for,6,26 November 2016,"""Death Becomes Her"" clearly deserved the Oscar it received for best visual effects at the 1993 Academy Awards. I first saw this film in the theater when it came out in 1992. The cast is quite good and there are some very funny scenes. The 180-degree turned head of Meryl Streep's Madeline Ashton was quite a feat, as is the cannon-ball size hole in Goldie Hawn's Helen Sharp. Both are funny scenes. The closing scene with rolling heads is funny as well. Streep is especially good in her comedy role, and Bruce Willis is hilarious in places. He plays a plastic surgeon, Ernest Menville. The movie is a dark comedy with demonic overtones. The violence is done in such a way that the humor in most scenes diminishes it. Still, it's not something for young audiences or fickle people to watch. There may be a small moral lesson in the film, intended or not: ""Be careful what you wish for."" Or, ""An eternity in this life might be more hell on earth than happiness in heaven.""",Death Becomes Her

I don't know that I would describe it as a guilty secret but I can see where someone was coming from who said that. It is in no way a great film but I enjoy watching it and it makes me smile to think about watching it. The jokes are many and frequent if, admittedly, not necessarily gut busting, it is just that the whole idea is amusing and the ridiculous special effects so lovely. Where the doctor is forcing Meryl Streep's hand further and further backwards towards her arm (as if he really would) it is as if he is daring her to speak out, as it gradually dawns on him she is dead. Dead-ish anyway, and I think this is a problem for some, the silliness of the whole situation.

28,JamesHitchcock,The Emperor Has No Clothes,6,6 November 2014,"Although she had a supporting role in Woody Allen's magnificent comedy ""Manhattan"", during the early part of her career Meryl Streep was more closely associated with serious drama. In the late eighties and early nineties, however, she began to diversify into comedy, starring in the likes of ""Postcards from the Edge"", ""She-Devil"" and ""Death Becomes Her"". Here Meryl plays Madeline Ashton, a conceited, self-obsessed Broadway actress who owes something to Bette Davis's character in ""All about Eve"". The film focuses on Madeline's long-running feud with the writer Helen Sharp, a feud which becomes all the more bitter after Madeline lures away Helen's fiancé, a plastic surgeon named Ernest Menville. This is, however, more than a simple tale of two middle-aged love-rivals who loathe one another, as it also contains a strong supernatural fantasy element. Madeline and Helen are both obsessed with their fading looks and avail themselves of the services of Liesl von Rhoman, a specialist in ""beauty and youth rejuvenation"". Liesl's secret is a magic potion that confers eternal youth, although this seemingly desirable gift comes (of course) with a heavy cost. This is essentially a cautionary tale on the theme of ""be careful what you wish for"". (Liesl's name is spelled as ""Lisle"" in the cast list, but as it is always pronounced in the film to rhyme with ""weasel"", not with ""while"", I presume this is a misspelling). The film was directed by Robert Zemeckis who seems to specialise in films which rely heavily on special effects. (He also made the likes of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"", ""Forrest Gump"" and ""What Lies Beneath). ""Death Becomes Her"" is no exception and won the Academy Award for Visual Effects. One of the effects of the potion is that it enables the drinker to survive injuries which would prove fatal to any other person, so we see Meryl Streep with her head on back- to-front after falling downstairs and Goldie Hawn with a bowling-ball-sized hole in her midriff after being blasted with a shotgun, all courtesy of Industrial Light and Magic. Streep later admitted that she disliked acting in a film that relied so heavily on special effects, calling it ""tedious"" and ""my first, my last, my only"". Yet she and Goldie Hawn are great fun to watch as the bitchy pair. Their characters may be rather one-dimensional but both actresses throw themselves into their parts with great enthusiasm. (They also look stunning for two women in their forties). Some of Meryl's other comedy characters are also vain and narcissistic, notably Mary Fisher in ""She- Devil"" and her greatest comic creation, Miranda Priestly in ""The Devil Wears Prada"", essentially Madeline translated from a magical fantasy to something more closely resembling the real world. Bruce Willis is also amusing as the put-upon, alcoholic Ernest, caught between two monstrous harridans, so different from Bruce's normal ""tough guy"" characters. There is a good cameo from Isabella Rossellini, showing she has inherited the good looks of her famous mother Ingrid Bergman, as the mysterious, seductive Liesl. Yet despite the quality of the acting, the film no longer seems as fresh as it did when first released in 1992, and I think that the reason has something to do with those special effects. It is not merely that what once seemed ground-breaking now seems commonplace. It is also that in the intervening two-and-a-bit decades we have learned to beware of CGI, which has so often been abused by film-makers in order to hide the fact that the Emperor has no clothes. ""Death Becomes Her"" is a case in point. Beneath some skillful acting performances, beneath some once-innovative effects the truth is that deep down it's ..... well, actually there is no deep down. There may be some cheap moralising at the end along the lines of ""Be happy with what you are"", but this essentially a superficial movie, with nothing of any substance beneath the surface and something rather mean-spirited about all that bitchery between Madeline and Helen. 22 years on, all the CGI in the world can no longer hide that superficiality- if indeed it ever could. 6/10",Death Becomes Her
29,Smells_Like_Cheese,Goofy Madness,7,19 November 2003,"Classic 90's time, this is one of those movies that I kind of remember seeing on TV five million times as a kid. I always loved watching it, it had the most incredible effects and I thought it was so funny. I was such a deranged 7 year old I guess. But still to this day, I really enjoy watching Death Becomes Her. It has a very clever story, amazing effects and three great actors: Bruce Willis, Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn. Who said dark comedies can't be good? Death Becomes her shows the true competitive side of women that scares most of the human race, how far we will go to be the hottest, the smartest, the kindest, etc. But also the whole essence of eternal youth, beauty and living forever, and Death Becomes Her handles the subject very well.Actress Madeline Ashton and writer Helen Sharp are longtime rivals. Helen's life falls apart when glamorous Madeline steals Helen's fiancé, plastic surgeon Ernest Menville, and marries him. Seven years later, Helen is now an obese, depressed woman, and is arrested and placed in a mental institution. Obsessed with getting revenge against Madeline, she struggles in the institution with healing. Madeline's career on Broadway ends, and 14 years later she is still struggling with her fading looks and bygone acting career. Ernest, now an alcoholic and miserable in his marriage, has been reduced to working as a high-end mortician. When Madeline and Helen meet again at Helen's book-signing party, Helen appears miraculously rejuvenated, thin, and youthful. Madeline is first dumbfounded then jealous. As part of Helen's plan, she plays both Madeline and Ernest, telling them each she has never blamed them for her ruined love life. Madeline resorts to the aid of the mysterious Lisle Von Rhoman, who claims she has discovered the secret of eternal youth. Madeline purchases the potion, drinks it, and is delighted to see her body visibly losing the signs of aging as she watches in a mirror, leaving her thin, firm, and young. Helen, meanwhile, seduces Ernest and reveals to him a detailed and foolproof plot to kill Madeline. Ernest kills Madeline, Madeline is still alive Madeline kills Helen Helen is still alive death has become them.The film is flawed no doubt, it should have developed the characters a bit more, we never really understood why Madeline and Helen were friends in the first place as it seems like they've always hated each other, they could have just explored the friendship a little further. As well as why we should care what is happening to these pretty horrible characters. But still this is one of those films that for some reason keeps me watching it every time it pops up on TV. I think it was a lot of fun and had some good laughs, especially the fight between Madeline and Helen, they discover that there's really no point to inflicting physical pain but keep going at it with each other. This is a recommendation to those who have a strange sense of humor, it's something only a few will get.7/10",Death Becomes Her
30,lasttimeisaw,"Ouch, it sucks big!",4,24 March 2014,"The overhanging message of this Zemeckis' dark comedy is ""if a woman doesn't have ageless skin, immortality means nothing"", that doesn't smell politically correct, right? Three big names in Hollywood then, Streep, Willis and Hawn (arguably Hawn was on the wane) gather in a morbid comedy teasing death and immortality, sounds a bravado project for Streep and Willis, whose bent for outright chick flick is put to the test. Also after the huge success of BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy, Zemeckis is a safe bet to polish the absurd special effects, alas, the final work is still cringe-worthy and hard to overlook its glaring vilification of a woman's worth and the blatant bandwagon of male chauvinism. I blame the writers Martin Donovan and David Koepp, they are terrible misogynists. The rivalry between Helen (Hawn) and Madeline (Streep), two old schoolmates are diverting at first, who doesn't want to watch Hawn and Streep in a cat-fight? But the character execution is awful, Helen starts as an sympathetic victim, who loses his fiancé Ernest (Willis) to a haughty Madeline, a hammy actress, after a 7-year-post-breakup-weight-increase spell and another 8 year of clandestine dormancy, she mystifyingly morphs into some lascivious slut and even writes a book about skin-care, in hindsight, one of the side effects of the magic potion must be personality-remolding. Her revenge plan goes amiss when Madeline goes to an exotic woman Lisle Von Rhuman (Rossellini) for help and drinks the elixir to procure immortality. Then comes the cat-fight, a bit too late and too droll, it turns out both are the clients of Miss Von Rhuman, so they puerilely reconcile, from then on, the plot takes a tumble to let Ernest occupies the moral high ground while the two female immortals retreat to sidebars as vacuous vases, all they do is screaming and urging him to drink the elixir as well (oh, I forget to mention Ernest is a one-and-only cosmetic surgeon), that's why he is so vital to them. Finally the nondescript Ernest is not only the prey of two women, but also the hero who refutes to imperishability and heroically proselytizes us the orthodox meaning of eternal life in his own funeral! Enough is enough, the twaddle is beyond truism. The ridicule is ceaseless but threadbare, Hawn and Willis has done something worse, but it is so shameful to watch Rossellini flaunts her not so perfect nudity (as the age of 38) at the expense of her exotic eroticism to pander to the heterosexual male audience, and it is a blemish in Streep's pristine filmography too, although the role is a cinch for her, I do love the opening singing sequences, a musical pastiche of SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH, that's the film should be made instead!",Death Becomes Her

As a result, they both duel it out and ultimately try to see who will win over love interest Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis).This is a movie that blends in dark comedy and fantasy, giving you some laughs and outrageously funny moments. Streep and Hawn make a hilarious rival duo; their hatred and spiteful actions toward each other are entertaining to watch. And, it is refreshing to see Willis, known for his action flicks, take on a more low key, dramatic and somewhat nerdy role (too nerdy at times), which strikes a balance between the comedy and seriousness in the film.There are some campy and goofy elements in the film and the plot is pretty simple - not much overall thrills or suspense. But, it is a well-paced movie with some sophisticated special effects and some good direction done by Robert Zemeckis.

33,theowinthrop,As Bad As Jonathan Swift Suggested?,8,7 May 2007,"This amusing film is based on a premise that we all toy with in our wish fulfillment moments: wouldn't it be wonderful if we lived forever, and retained our best youthful appearance through it all. Call it the ""Dorian Gray"" wish, from Wilde's novel. It sounds great, but writers have been toying with immortality since the ancients, and usually show it's shortcomings. Jonathan Swift's ""strudblugs"" in the third book of GULLIVER'S TRAVELS best show the main problem: if you live forever, you will inevitably lose all your faculties, and just wish to die. Wilde, of course took this apart by having Gray wish for immortality and youth at the expense of his soul. But the scriptwriters of this play mention that immortal youth is not enough. How do you guard yourself against unexpected physical injuries? And is life worthwhile if you are a lonely, bitter, or nasty person?Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn are the main protagonists in the plot. They are rival Hollywood glamor stars of the 1960s - 1970s, who both detest each other (sort of like the two young actresses in 2LDK). Both recall roles and boyfriends they lost due to the availability or machinations of the other. Neither notices they are both incredibly selfish bitches, and that most thinking people have as little to do with them as possible.They are aware of the age factor: After a certain number of years a glamor queen is no longer young enough (in Hollywood terms) to maintain her title. Each is already losing more and more parts that they both drool over to younger (presumably more likable) actresses. Also they both have need for a nip and tuck now and then. Soon they are trying to snare the services of Hollywood's leading plastic surgeon, Bruce Willis.Willis does his best for the ladies, but they are so shallow and insecure that they are ripe for the plucking. Along comes Isabella Rosallini (in a nice change of pace evil role) as a female Satan. Separately she offers an immortality potion to both women for their souls. They are not the first to take it (we later see a sequence of all the lost souls who have taken it, including Elvis and Marilyn - both of whom faked their deaths). Soon the two women are aware of the one failure of the potion. Yes they stay young and can live forever, but both of them find that they need the continuous services of Willis in case some injury occurs that may not heal ""beautifully"". Willis is going up the wall with these two demanding divas. Finally they suggest to Rosallini that she offer Willis the same immortality potion as a bribe to keep him happy. But Willis is one sensible dude. He recognizes the pitfall of life eternal, at the beck and call of Scylla and Charybdis. So he is determined to escape.The film ends quite satisfactorily with both the women in a permanent jail of their own selfish reasons (they are forced to live together to try to care for each other, and both hate each other's guts). And Willis - he finds that the road to permanent happiness and mass respect has little time for immortality.",Death Becomes Her

This means that there's essentially nothing to grab on to, least of all the incredibly unlikable characters. The movie can never quite decide who it wants to follow, and, thus, we have don't have anything to care about, not even all the special effects spectacle - which actually just erupts from essentially nowhere in the flick's latter half. The effects are fairly impressive if you consider the time of release, but they're made such a big deal of, and are honestly such an important pillar of any potential enjoyment, that their inevitable ageing is all the more evident and detrimental - which is actually quite ironic, though possibly beneficial, given the piece's themes. 4/10",Death Becomes Her

Maybe it was because it spanned many genres and was only a 'modest hit' at the Box Office. However, I really enjoyed it when it was first released and every time I revisit it on DVD it seems as fresh, enjoyable and relevant as it was back then.Meryl Streep steps out of her usual acting comfort zone and portrays an aging (and not particularly talented!) actress who is struggling to remain in the public eye and resorting to ever more plastic surgery to retain her youth. And, as if she wasn't already a particularly unsympathetic character, she also seems to take great delight in stealing every man her 'best friend' (Goldie Hawn) brings before her and even ends up marrying Goldie's latest - a plastic surgeon (coincidentally!), played by an equally out-of-character Bruce Willis.Don't expect Mr Willis to be chucking any German terrorists out of high-rise buildings here. It seems he wanted a brief stint away from dying (hard) in favour of a more humourous turn when the two women in his life start dabbling in the supernatural in order to live forever. I mention him the most because he really does seem like he's having real fun sending himself up and relishes in his exaggeratedly crazy performance.First of all, I'd say it's a comedy, but seeing as the supernatural is such an integral part of the plot, it sort of spans 'horror' and even 'drama' when it comes to which genre it fits into. Obviously, with such a stellar trio of acting heavyweights in the lead, all three take their respective turns in the spotlight and play off each other perfectly. You'll love them and hate them whenever the story requires you to do so.There are even a few special effects that are required. These do seem to have not held up as well as the acting/comedy/drama and you can definitely make out a blue screen here and there. But then seeing as the performances and laughs are so good, I'm sure most people will find it in themselves to be a little forgiving on this one.I won't go into the plot too much, as there are probably some elements in there that you might not see coming. If you believe what you read about the production online, you'll see that it went through a fair few rewrites and the final product does seem a little all over the place at times in terms of narrative structure. This is only a minor criticism as it does add to the feeling of not known exactly how it will all turn out.I remember when I first saw it, the only real gripe I had with it was the very end. It does seem to suddenly just end rather abruptly, but - again - when everything else has been so good I can also forgive this one.With today's obsession with looks being magnified thanks to social media, you can only wonder what the characters would have been like if this film was made today. Because of the overall themes of desperation to remain young and in the spotlight, the film seems as fresh today as it ever was. Don't let it be forgotten, it really is great fun and a forgotten classic.",Death Becomes Her
36,The-Sarkologist,Eternal Beauty Always Comes with a Catch,8,23 December 2011,"This movie is probably the antipathy of the black comedy. It is not one where we laugh at death, but rather see death taken to the extreme end where it is hilarious and unbelievable. I am not saying that it is funny, namely because I did not laugh once during the movie, but rather it makes the idea of death comical.Basically this movie is about two women, Madeline Ashton (Meryl Streep) and Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn) who are basically spending all of their life trying to be better than the other. The thing about Madeline is that she always succeeds while Helen seems to always fail, and as such she feels a deep seated resentment towards her. The breaking point is when her fiancé, Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis) dumps Helen for Madeline and for the next seven years Helen goes insane in her hatred of Madeline.The bulk of the movie takes place in 1992, when after 7 years, Helen appears again but this time she looks incredibly young. For the first time, Helen is able to come up better than Madeline, for Madeline is obsessed about her looks and her age, and everywhere she goes, she is reminded about how old she is becoming. That is until she discovers Helen's secret, a potion that bestows upon them eternal youth - but there is a catch, as well as giving one eternal youth, it also gives you eternal unlife - where when you die you will walk about almost zombified and must continue to look after your body otherwise it will fall apart on you.I guess the main thing about the movie is that idea about eternal youth and eternal life. We finish in the year 2029 when Ernest is dead and the women are listening to his eulogy, and laughing at the irony of it. Eternal youth he didn't gain from a magical potion, but rather the desire to continue to be fit and live life, and his eternal life comes from the memory of his deeds that he has left behind. Helen and Madeline simply slip away into obscurity, becoming little more than a shattered form of themselves, while Ernest, the guy that they were fighting over for his ability to create the illusion of youth, and later the illusion of life, remains forever in the memories of those who loved him.",Death Becomes Her

At some point , I'm certain everyone dreams of the Fountain of Youth. But no-one ever stop to think what the consequences might be. This film is a fantastic depiction of what might happen.

38,filipemanuelneto,An amazing and funny movie that doesn't deserve to be forgotten.,9,15 September 2021,"This is one of the best black comedies I know, even though it suffers from the transversal problems of black humor: it's caustic, it's irreverent, it's sarcastic and has an acidity that isn't for all tastes. And most interesting: it brings together an extraordinary cast full of guys we know well and whose talent needs no introduction.In the film, two childhood friends come to hate each other to death: they competed with each other for years, mainly in terms of their own beauty and love, stealing each other's husbands whenever possible. After a defeat, one of her friends goes into a deep depression, gains immense weight and ends up in a mental institution, where she develops a murderous obsession against her old enemy. When she steps out into the outside world, however, she looks beautiful, stunning, powerful... and determined to get revenge. All thanks to a mysterious elixir, jealously guarded by a strange woman.The film is truly unmissable for fans of black humor, and will surely please others thanks to its comic tone and a roguish story, full of twists and turns, in which the characters conspire against each other, determined to kill themselves, and they survive, albeit with hilarious marks on their bodies. It's one of those movies that you lose when you try to explain it, so the best thing is to see it. I saw it many years ago, and now I have been able to see it again and enjoy it again.The cast, as I said, is full of famous names, starting with the lead duo Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn. The two actresses are great and even better when they're together. It was truly a surprise to see Streep in work so far from what she's used to, but there's no doubt that the hard work of the two actresses is a strong reason to see this film. Bruce Willis is also very good and works well, stripping away his usual charisma and taking on the role of the idiot and deeply comic husband/lover. To make things even more bizarre, we have the iconic Isabella Rosselini, slim and magnificent in the role of an exotic and exuberant malefic figure, as strange and surreal as a sphinx cat.Technically, the film is an unrecognized gem thanks to the talent of Robert Zemeckis. It was one of the most innovative films of its decade, where several new solutions were tested in terms of CGI, visual and special effects, and where photorealistic human skin software was used for the first time. Everything that would be used later, and with more mastery, in movies that we love and that make this movie even more surreal. The cinematography fulfills its role well and the sets and costumes are truly iconic, with the beautiful mansions of the characters and the dresses worn by the two protagonists (or the almost absence of clothes by Rosselini). The soundtrack doesn't deserve much attention, but it fulfills its role.",Death Becomes Her
39,TheMovieDiorama,Death Becomes Her consumes magical powers of youth to avoid typical roles for its actors.,6,11 July 2019,"Freakishly bizarre. Absurdly unusual. Unnaturally weird. The schlocky originality that oozes out of every aspect that the film harnesses, is enough to make me question my own verdict. Not since the Japanese problematic extravaganza 'Hausu', have I completed a film with an overwhelming sense of conflicting emotions. Did I, or did I not, like Death Becomes Her? I just don't know. However, after a night of reflection (literally, staring at a mirror) and clinging onto my youthful complexion, I finally came to an all important conclusion. I liked it. After running off into the sunset with a beautiful actress, a plastic surgeon finds himself battling his own morality when the two lovers in his life drink a potion that grants them the power to live forever (with youthful looks, of course).An absurdist's perspective on vanity and lust, Zemeckis' black comedy blends his trademark innovative visual effects with purposefully exaggerated performances to produce a somewhat humorous tale exploring the shallow depths of mortality. The only reason why this film works as well as it does, is due to the sheer bombastic hyperbole. Streep, Willis, Hawn and even Zemeckis himself are all out of their comfort zones and, whilst it clearly becomes evident that this is the case, works for just how campy the overall tone is. The first act is flat and unfortunately cannot decide what direction to take.However as soon as Streep consumes the potion of youth, Zemeckis throws all of his magical cards on the table. Stylised visuals to re-animate inconceivable body positions (albeit somewhat dated now), Streep and Willis hamming up their performances to maximum potential and enough squabbles to fuel a heavy-weight championship.The problem, which is why I was left undecided, was with how hollow the entire film was. The light thematic exploration on vanity, grief, loss, mortality, beauty and wealth were not enough to prevent the story from feeling empty. The narrative time jumps from seven to thirty-something years. The characters rarely being likeable, lacking an emotional investment towards the shovel whacking shenanigans and spray painted disguises. The story absent of natural development due to the lightning-pace of the narrative. Many comedic moments coming off as relentlessly forced and not receiving the intended laughs. I would even go as far as saying that Streep overacted too excessively! A consequence of such a campy, schlocky and exaggerated film is, whilst original in concept, can be deemed as ""critic-proof"". The criticisms on the silly performances, absurd story and uncontrolled dialogue are instantly diminished by the fact that Zemeckis intended the film to harness those qualities. But, in doing so, has left a gaping hole (much like the one Streep produced on Hawn's stomach...) that forces the end product to be artificially hollow.Don't get me wrong, it was enjoyable light entertainment and once Zemeckis found his footing the humour was uncovered in every scene. Just an experience that left me wanting to sip some more youth tonic, considering it's unique aesthetic. Rossellini looked fabulous though, like damn...!",Death Becomes Her

Streep, who plays the older of the two, has had the upper hand for several years when something dreadful happens, age catches up with her. But just when all seems lost, she discovers what may be the answer to her prayers, a potion that promises eternal youth.Bruce Willis, Goldie Hawn and Meryl Streep all seem to enjoy themselves thoroughly as will an audience that really delights in this sort of riotous romp. Zemeckis' film is a reasonable fantasy, but works best delivering its over the top black humour, which our director handles well.Alan Silvestri's music suits the mood well, and puts a nice finishing touch on a show that is never absolutely brilliant, but is certainly quite entertaining and even occasionally hilarious.

50,dierregi,Dark humour with a touch of philosophy,7,27 August 2020,"Streep is Madeleine Ashton, an ageing, mediocre actress and a very nasty person. Hawn is Helen, another nasty piece of work involved in a most antagonistic relation with Madeleine since high school. Willis is the unfortunate Ernest, previously engaged to Helen, then ""stolen"" by Madeleine just out of spite.Their dysfunctional relationships coalesce thanks to the intervention of Isabella Rossellini, in an hilarious role as Lisle Von Rhuman, a woman who can sell immortality and eternal youth.The funniest scene of the movie is definitely Madeleine and Lisle's meeting. Streep is excellent in conveying the faded star who's seen it all and doesn't believe the hype until she actually sees it working.The setting and plot development are very gothic, even macabre and I am not surprised the movie was not a success in the 90s.

51,rbverhoef,Streep and visual effects,6,22 November 2004,"Robert Zemeckis is one of those directors who know how to deal with visual effects. Like a Tim Burton or a Paul Verhoeven he creates films that can be appreciates only by their visuals. With 'Death Becomes Her' we have the visuals, a terrific Meryl Streep together with Goldie Hawn and the man they both like played by Bruce Willis. Both women become invincible because they drink a potion offered to them by Isabella Rossellini. They smash each others faces off, shoot each other, fall from high things and survive all this. The visual effects come in handy since the wounds do not heel very well.All this is thrown into a plot that is useless to explain since it only exists to support the visuals and the nice moments from Streep, Hawn and Willis. Of course sometimes that is fun to watch but after an hour or so I had seen enough. I finished the movie, but the fun was gone. Well, the final scene makes sure you will end the movie with a smile.

52,vertigo_14,A Special Effects Bonanza! (spoilers),8,27 July 2004,"I love 'Death Becomes Her' for it's simplistic, artful and comedic method of storytelling (the character's wild facial gestures, the quick zooms, etc) in a style that reminds me of 'Three O'Clock High.' I also love it for the special effects, the thing that can really make a movie great, and in this movie, pretty bizarre. This is a story about the dangers of everlasting youth done in a quite a creative manner. The main characters of the story are two female friends (Meryl Streep as the coniving Madeline Ashton and Goldie Hawn as the impetuous Helen Sharp) divided by one man, an idiotic, cynical, alcoholic mortician (Dr. Ernest Menville). When famous actress Madeline stole Helen's fiancee from her, Helen went into hiding, Madeline's ego seemed to engulf the planet, and Ernest became increasingly withdrawn and abused by his demeaning wife (Madeline). At first, Madeline thought she won the little cat fight among the two friends when Helen turned into a fat recluse who shared a filthy apartment with a jungle of cats. But, Madeline is in for a big surprise. The women will soon be engaged in another violent fight, competing against one another. But this time, it isn't so much about vying for Ernest's attention. Neither really cares about the poor, drunk dope. To win would be merely to be able to woo him away from the other without any strings attached. Nothing sincere at all. But, now, Ernest is not really the object of the game. Now, it is eternal beauty for one, and instant death for the other. A fight to the finish.Madeline attends a party for Helen, and goes with Ernest, expecting Helen to be the same fat, sick looking woman she remembers reading about in a tabloid. But, she is surprised to find that Helen is just as young and stunning as Madeline could ever remember. Ernest, too. And now, it's Helen - one, Madeline - zero. Madeline wants to know Helen's secret, and she'll have to if she's going to hang on to Ernest who is already floating away.That's where Lisle Von Rhoman (Isabella Roselini) comes in, as an enticing, grossly wealthy, but beautiful woman who holds the secret to everlasting youth: a vile containing an incredible (and incredibly expensive) potion that would provide the eager women with the promise of an eternity of beauty. Only, Madeline and Helen, once again in their competition with one another, misuse the potion.When Ernest and Helen plot to kill Madeline, who according to Ernest, is sucking the life out of him, the plan backfires because the women both used so much potion, neither of them can die. Oh sure, they can giant holes blown in their chest the size of a close range shot gun shell blast, or have their necks twisted on backwards after getting creamed with a shovel to the head, but the potion keeps them from dying. Needless to say, the women's desire to outnumber the other turned against the both of them. Especially their egotistical desire for eternal youth. Now, they'll suffer the consequences.The special effects are A + on this movie! Watching Meryl Streep moving around with her head on backwards, or when they fall down the steps and falls apart like mannequins. It's simply amazing and makes this quite a bizarre, black comedy. One that is great for the visual elements alone. The story is funny as well--a murder plot in which the two victims just can't seem to die...at all...ever. Helen and Madeline's vicious competition is simply hilarious as so many mishaps and double-crossing goes on. It's a great Saturday afternoon movie.",Death Becomes Her
53,davidmvining,Amusing but loosely told,6,21 April 2020,"Robert Zemeckis is a great filmmaker who understands character, story structure, and basic narrative as much as he enjoys working with the newest technical toys the film world has to offer, but, like most artists, not every film is at the same level as his best work. What Death Becomes Her offers is a funny expanded episode of Tales from the Crypt with some very good special effects (especially for the time), but there are a couple of things about it that holds it back narratively.As amusing as it is, the movie's opening is a really long introduction that has to do everything twice. It skips forward seven years twice, and at the end of it, we get reintroduced to two of the three main characters who have changed a good bit from their original introduction a few minutes before. That's particularly true for Bruce Willis' character, Dr. Ernest Menville, who went from a world-renowned plastic surgeon to a depressive alcoholic embalmer of famous cadavers. It's not he changed jobs, but that he went from a perpetually happy man in love with one woman and then another to a man who falls asleep on the floor of his office and wakes up to a Bloody Mary, demanding more vodka in the drink. Ten minutes in and he's already a completely different character. It makes you wonder why the movie spent time building him as a character before that change. I mean, the opening is amusing as we watch Dr. Ernest go from engaged to the comely Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn) to married to her childhood friend and actress Madeline Ashton. Helen goes from comely to a fat cat lady who revels in a movie scene where Madeline gets choked to death. Through it all, Madeline is obsessed with her looks, epitomizing vanity. It's all amusing but frustrating at the same time.When we finally get to the time of the bulk of the movie (14 years after the first scene), Ernest is waking up from his drunken night and Madeline is doing everything she can to keep herself looking young at fifty. They go to Helen's newest book release party (7 years after Helen, as a fat cat lady, was pulled from her apartment and shoved in a mental hospital) where she reveals herself to be more attractive than she's ever been with a blood red dress and red hair. Struck by the image of youth from her friend of the same age, Madeline ends up running to a mysterious woman in a cavernous house who offers her a magic potion to keep her young. Unfortunately for Madeline, Ernest and Helen are plotting to kill Madeline so that they can run away and marry like they should have before Madeline broke up their marriage.Of course, given the movie's title, death comes for her, in this case being both Madeline and Helen. The potion that they both took (Helen years before) keeps them youthful forever whether alive or dead, and they both end up dead. The rest of the movie is their fight to stay together, using the aid of Ernest and his deep knowledge of plastic surgery and embalming to keep them looking alive. Bruce Willis gets rather manic in entertaining fashion, and the movie climaxes at a party of people who have taken the potion where Ernest decides that eternal youth is nothing he wants, choosing to run away and turn old naturally.My other major problem happens at the turn just after Helen dies. She's been on a quest for seven years, harboring hatred of Madeline for 14 years, and the moment they realize that they can't kill each other because they're already dead, she simply gives up the quest for vengeance. It's a rather large turn for a character who was driven by a single motive for the first half of the film. Yes, she can no longer kill Madeline, but she can still exact vengeance in different ways. Instead, they become best buddies for the rest of the film, connected for their mutual need of Ernest's skills in order to keep up their bodies. They do both need him, but they don't need each other at first. After the jump, the relationship feels like its from a different story, however, accepting it after that part, it has a twisted logic that I like. They're co-dependent on each other, and the look at them thirty seven years later, their bodies having continued to deteriorate, arguing about how they need to get to the hardware store for new supplies to keep up their bodies, is, again, amusing.The special effects, especially considering the time the movie was made, are actually quite impression. Mostly, they center around Madeline's head, which turns backwards, gets shoved into her chest, and pushed all the way to touch her back, and the hole in Helen's abdomen from a shotgun blast. The weakest part is Madeline's head when it's backwards. There's a floatiness to the CGI head replacement that doesn't quite fit, but considering its age, again, it's actually quite impressive. I mean, the movie was made in 1992 and has a CGI head replacement where my only complaint is that it feels a little floaty.So, it's pretty consistently amusing and often quite funny, but the story takes forever to get going and the biggest character turn doesn't feel right. I'm kind of mixed on the film, but I enjoyed it while I watched it.",Death Becomes Her
54,Seraphion,A not that funny nor scary comedy horror,6,30 July 2014,"It's good that the movie start being all horror and stuff or trying to be scary and funny at the same time. The earlier small jokes are then easily laughable and very enjoyable. Yet when the part that is supposed to be horror comes in, it comes in an overly hyperbolic way that it kind of fail to balance between keeping he comedy funny and the horror scary or at least spooky. The cat fight after dead just really doesn't support the scary aspect for this movie. If only the horror part is kept to be just a nuisance and variation, this movie would've been better. One thing nice to see is only Bruce Willis trying to act good here, although he could never really nail it thanks to the story being such hyperbolic.",Death Becomes Her
55,nycritic,Let the Cat-Fight Begin,8,19 May 2005,"If only Bette Davis and Joan Crawford could be alive today and see this! Two emasculating she-wolfs battling it out - they think - because they want one man, but really, it's all about ego and oneupmanship, and with two equally established actresses such as Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn, both looking exceptionally beautiful in their mid-40s, DEATH BECOMES HER is a visual treat that throws back an unintentional but hilarious reference to the aforementioned divas who preceded them. Very tongue-in-cheek, and whoever saw (and read) the sustained repulsion Davis and Crawford sustained throughout their life, mirrored in WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? will not be lost on the background reference.A simple premise presides: Madeline Ashton (Streep), a fading B-movie actress, relegated to performing an awful musical based on SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH, sets sight on renown surgeon Ernest Manville (Bruce Willis) whom Helen Sharp (Hawn) has taken to meet her as a test to prove he will still be hers after their meet. Needless to say, he drops his commitment to Helen, marries Madeline, and sends Helen into a spiraling self-destruct mode. Years later she becomes a bloated whale - a shell of her former self - living in total abandon, watching Madeline's movies obsessively, seething in hatred, until she is evicted from her apartment and has a brilliant idea while in a mental facility: she must eliminate Madeline.Madeline, on the other end, is no less happy. A total, absolute bitch, she has reduced Ernest to blubber. She hates the way she looks at 50 and the way young girls preen their perky looks. Both live in marital hell. An invite to attend Helen's book party (on beauty) has her howling in laughter - beauty tips from a disgusting fattie? Please! - but when she sees that Helen is now a svelte redhead, she balks - and their reunion is one of dripping, beautiful venom, the highlight of the entire movie. Distraught, she seeks the advice of a mysterious woman, Lisle von Rhuman whom she was referred to earlier, and she gives her what seems an innocent potion to drink which will restore her looks. Meanwhile, Helen is planning to have Ernest dispose of Madeline and rekindling their botched affair. When Madeline returns home, she gets into a heated argument with Ernest and he pushes her down the stairs. She is dead.Or is she? A marvelous setup that until this point in the story works, but one which later takes a left turn to be overcome by silly fight scenes and cartoonish special effects that recall Tim Burton circa 1987. The triangle of actors work absolutely perfectly here, Streep drips with venomous lines reminiscent of Elizabeth Taylor's overwhelming performance as Martha in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?; however, Hawn and Willis, while established as personalities more than actors of considerable range, fare better than Streep in that she is ""expected"" to play hers to perfection. Hawn on the other hand proves she's capable of very dark roles that suggest more than they give. Willis, stripped of his usual machismo, comes across as a broken man who throughout most of the film is emasculated but makes one crucial decision which saves him from an uncertain fate. Casting these three actors are cast against type works in this edgy comedy, and if anything, it's final act is its own weakness, as if the writers had somehow not known where to go with the inevitable, violent encounter between them but all in all, it's still very enjoyable.Robert Zemeckis, though, makes one glaring mistake during one of the key scenes. When Streep rises from the ground, we see Willis in the foreground talking on the phone to Helen who wants to know if she is dead. We know she is not; the deep focus has established she is not. As she slowly makes her way to where Willis is, Zemeckis chooses to cut to Hawn for a brief second. Big mistake. We don't need to see her sitting in front of her shrine of hatred for Madeline - we know she hates her, it's quite clear - so he should have held that scene perfectly still, allowing us to see Streep get closer and closer to the forefront. That is suspense in itself: how will Willis react to seeing his wife shuffling her way to him. But the use of deep focus is something that has fallen out of vogue in film-making, as if they've lost the interest to really tell a visual story, and the quick cut to Hawn being the need to give her a moment's screen time.",Death Becomes Her
56,raulfaust,Bruce Willis has always seen dead people...,6,17 August 2011,"Hmm, what to say. ""Death Becomes Her"" has an original story about two women who wishes to be forever young, as if it was possible. In a very improbable way, the filmmakers are professional enough to make it look possible, using good special effects for that time. The desire of having eternal life and youth is understandable and may sound little crazy, but crazier than that is womanizer played by Willis pretend to prefer dying than living forever; if you are in risk of losing your life, you'll surely do whatever it takes to protect yourself from it, your famous basic instincts will show up to not let you die. But since it's a fictional story, I may forgive that.I don't know why people label it as comedy; it has two or three laughing scenes, which isn't enough to classify it as comedy. It's maybe an innovative scifi fantasy with well made conversations, effects and plot, but no comedy or a laughing movie at all. Worth spending some time, but not a great movie in any circumstance.",Death Becomes Her
57,Kamurai25,Boring becomes her.,4,11 April 2020,"Surprisingly boring watch, not likely to watch again, and can't recommend.I'm honestly confused why this movie doesn't work for me. The premise and overall story itself seem fairly solid, but not overally impressive. Bruce Willis, Goldie Hawn, and Meryl Streep, even in 1992, were huge actors for these roles.Studios tend to think big celebrities will make the movie great, but they can only do so much. Using a cannon instead of a handgun isn't always better. So while everyone performed well on a decently written script: I don't think this was the right cast.I would really love to see a reboot of this. Possibly with more comedically focused writing and acting, and less dramatic conspiracy. A more serendipitous plot would be far more entertaining.I can't say it's bad, and it could have been great in 1992, but I think we can leave this one behind.",Death Becomes Her
58,PredragReviews,Siempre Viva!,8,30 April 2016,"Directed by the amazing Robert Zemeckis, ""Death Becomes Her"" features a clever script, an awesome cast, and mind-blowing special effects that most Hollywood films lack nowadays. Meryl Streep plays Madeline Ashton, an actress who is obsessed with keeping herself looking young and beautiful. Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn), is a plain looking author with a brilliant surgeon, Dr. Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis), for a fiancé. Madeline and Helen have hated each other for years, but things become even worse when Madeline steals Ernest from Helen and they get married. Years later, Madeline is even more obsessed with keeping her youth, willing to do anything to keep from aging physically. On the other hand, Helen is obsessed to get revenge on Madeline for stealing her fiancé. But it seems that there is one thing in common between the two rivals, in that both seem to know the same woman, Lisle Von Rhoman (Isabella Rossellini).The film revolves around the concept of vanity with the female protagonists looking to get their lives back with simply changing their appearances. Is it a comedy? Yes, ""Death Becomes Her"" could be called a comedy. But it has a very twisted sort of humor, you'll have to be someone who enjoys all forms of comedy to really enjoy and understand the humor. There is both laugh-out-loud slapstick humor, then there's the dry type of humor which takes a few seconds to really getting you chuckling. But more than anything, the satire and irony of the story is so well embedded into the plot that there's really no specific part you can pinpoint as the funniest part of the movie. Overall, I would recommend this to any one that likes off-beat comedies.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Death Becomes Her

This is a nightmare.""Death Becomes Her is one of my friend's favorite movies, and she finally convinced me to give it a shot, myself. I can't say that I fell in love with this dark comedy like she did, but it's not a bad movie.Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn play two life-long rivals who stumble upon the secret of eternal life, which adds a few complications when they both end up dying. Bruce Willis is the weak pawn who is used by both of them. These aren't the best roles for any of those actors, but each of them is watchable, as always.I appreciated the sly digs that Death Becomes Her aims at Hollywood's (and really, everyone's) obsession with youth, vanity, and physical beauty, but it didn't match up well with my sense of humor. And the special effects are merely amusing, now (though I'm sure they were outstanding back in '92). For me, this was just average entertainment that I didn't like and didn't dislike.

60,mike48128,A Slightly Scary Film-Funnier Than I Remember it!,10,16 May 2012,"To live forever, first you must die, after drinking a magic and rejuvenating potion. The special effects by Industrial Light & Magic won an Oscar. Perfect for the Halloween Season. Right up there with ""Beatlejuice"" and ""A & C Meet Frankenstein"". It is not totally original as the ""eternal youth"" plot-line has been used before in other films. Very clever use of the notion that ""all magic is evil and comes at a price"" which is currently being used in the ""Once Upon a Time"" T.V. series. Some brief rear nudity (not full) so this is not intended for young children. A great romp for Goldie Hawn, Meryl Streep, and Bruce Willis. One of the funniest films that Meryl has ever made. Look for film director Sidney Pollack in one brief scene. He is an ER doctor who has a heart attack when he discovers that Meryl Streep's character is already dead. It's a magical zombie movie! Everyone from Elvis to Marilyn Monroe has faked their own ""death"". See how many more dead actors and artists you recognize, at the party! Wonderful and unforgettable EFX with Meryl's head on backwards and a giant ""cartoon-like"" rifle-hole in Goldie Hawn's midsection. More enjoyable every time I watch it. The moral of the story is: never run out of make up and spray paint; and always remember where you parked the car. Also, always carry duct tape and superglue with you, at all times.",Death Becomes Her
61,valadas,Totally idiotic,3,9 May 2009,The immense talent of Meryl Streep and some amazing body special effects are not enough to save this movie of being totally idiotic and a huge bore. The story is stupidly told even for a fantastic comedy and lacks a lot of real imagination. The gags shown along the movie are not funny at all. The final scene is so silly that almost makes you cry with despair. We can only regret that Miss Streep's talent is wasted in such a crap movie. But in fact this story of living dead could have been much better filmed in the hands of more talented director than Robert Zemeckis of whom I can't remember having seen any good movie till now.,Death Becomes Her
62,rupie,morality tale in the guise of a hilarious black comedy,8,29 June 1999,"Why is it that so many of the really good comedies get such low user ratings? Does it have something to say about the taste &/or intelligence of the American public? Who knows? At any rate, this totally off-the-wall comedy has fine performances from all involved (I especially liked Willis), some really bizarre plot devices, a very funny script, and some absolutely unreal special effects. Like many comedies ('War of the Roses', 'Cold Turkey', 'Being There', and most of the movies of Albert Brooks) this is really a morality tale based on a human foible - in this case the fear of growing old and the search for perpetual youth, or at least a youthful appearance. This theme thus makes the movie less appealing to the junior high crowd; only those growing long in the tooth can understand the craving to maintain one's slipping youth. Don't miss this hilariously weird (or weirdly hilarious) movie!",Death Becomes Her
63,phubbs,Death Becomes Her,4,21 January 2014,"A film about rich and famous folk trying desperately to cling on to their youthful looks by any means necessary, well mainly women in this case. Gee not too far from the truth really is it, seeing these two aging Hollywood female stars, neither of which are particularly attractive in my book, acting narcissistic egotistical and spoilt whilst under thick layers of makeup. I think the trowels of makeup are the only way these two can achieve any remote level of beauty frankly.The plot is all about a magic potion that...errr magically turns people into younger firmer versions of themselves and gives you immortality. A potion of youth and eternal life, but the trick is you must disappear from public view after ten years to keep the secret...errrrrrm secret, yeah. So naturally you can expect the clichéd spectacle of seeing various ultra famous people popping up who have never really died from the public eye, forever immortal stars people wanna believe are still with us eg. James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis etc...The first thing that hits you is how can this supposedly sexy siren (Isabelle Rossellini), who's real age is 71, keep this amazing secret under wraps in LA of all places!. She has dished it out to so many famous people who all abuse their fame it seems, its incredible she hasn't been discovered. She's an illegal magic potion dealer with muscle bound henchmen who are also all on it. I would of thought it might also get harder to hide this when people die and start to walk around like decaying zombies as we see slowly with the main two characters.The other niggling bit is where exactly does she get this potion from? she seems to have quite a lot of it, does she make it in the basement?. And while I'm on it, her massive mansion, is that suppose to be 'disappearing from the public eye'?! really?? I mean seriously you couldn't get anymore attention if you tried!, the house is a freakin' castle!.Yes the films plot is totally full of holes but I guess its not suppose to be remotely serious, just a silly fantasy. To a degree it does work, this is mainly down to the terrific special effects that at the time were virtually groundbreaking. It was quite good ghoulish fun seeing Streep and Hawn battle it out 'Beetlejuice' style with all the undead goofiness. Willis doesn't really do much accept scream the whole time and the sets have a nice modern Gothic style accompanied by crashing lighting and thunder, which is cool for all the goths out there (like myself).When it came out this was a pretty big hit as I recall, stayed in the cinema a while and I did enjoy it when I saw it (at the cinema, mum LOVED it!). Looking back it doesn't really hold up, sure the effects are still quite neat and there are some amusing bits, but generally its so stupid, lame and completely makes no sense...which ruins it in the end. Its pretty much a live action cartoon with a wafer thin plot, the poster is also a complete rehash of 'The Witches of Eastwick', best stick with that movie though.4/10",Death Becomes Her
64,Stampsfightclub,Physically dark as it is comically funny,9,10 May 2009,"Falling actress Madeline Ashton (Streep) learns of a secret potion that will regenerate her beauty whilst her long term enemy Helen (Hawn) looks set to steal her husband Black comedies are some weird and wonderful creations. The Coen brothers are creative masters at such a genre, whether depicting the nature of the government in Burn after Reading or revealing the solidity of harsh actions in Intolerable Cruelty the pair have become a landmark and favourites.To take the concept of death and vanity and putting a comedy twist on it sounds almost as controversial as Dogma and as zany for Zemeckis as you like, given his previous hit was the final part in the Back to the Future trilogy. But despite the initially oddity of this picture, it is perfect comedy gold with a strange darkness and bizarreness to rival Tim Burton.The film begins with a song and dance routine with Meryl Streep in as good as singing voice as in her later role Mamma Mia! After a couple of confusing scenes we see Helen has gone into depression after her husband got hitched with Madeline and it seems we have a soapy style love triangle but after Madeline gets her hand on a love potion and we see Helen return to the mix, everything becomes much more light hearted and very funny, with sharp physical comedy and maintaining that level of bizarre activity throughout.Goldie Hawn is the stand out with a wacky crazed character that is simply likable despite her vindictiveness. Streep is, as ever, on fine form and pleasantly Willis has dived away from his stereotyped action hero into a soft hearted struggler who wants his life back. The pairing of the three works wonders and is hard to imagine any other in such roles as the playful comic acting is in perfect harmony with the wacky script.The film revolves around the concept of vanity with the female protagonists looking to get their lives back with simply changing their appearances. Echoes of Sunset Boulevard's excellent Gloria Swanson will be heard and there is almost a perfect intertextuality in the way Streep handles her character's selfishness.Winner of Best visual effects at the Oscars this 1992 comedy fantasy brings the comedy as well as the fantasy with some bizarre visuals including weapons through the stomach and a neck twisting scene that will make your neck turn the other way.Death Becomes Her is a must watch, simply because it is so out of sync with reality and maintains a strong level of comedy and fantasy that will make your head spin.",Death Becomes Her

How About Some ""PRETTY/UGLY""?",10,5 December 2008,"It usually bugs the living-dead crap out of me, when big-time Hollywood hot-shot producers take a 'B'-movie style concept, make a blockbuster out of it and then call it ""high-concept"" or ""psychological melodrama"" or what ever the hell way they want to spin it. So SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is not a horror film about a super-smart serial killer, it's an ""intense psychological thriller"". YEAHyeahyeah, WHAT-ever. You can slap some Max Factor lipstick, rouge and mascara on ol' Leatherface and you know what? The chainsaw won't seem any 'daintier' when it's cuttin' yer balls off!Unless, of course, they do it right and keep me happily entertained and chuckling wickedly for two hours. Then I don't care what they call it. A good genre movie is a good genre movie, whether it costs a buck-fifty or 150 mil to make. And luckily, director Robert Zemeckis knows how to give good movie, which he does with DEATH BECOMES HER.Written by the smart and snarky team of Martin Donovan and David Koepp (APARTMENT ZERO), DBH is all about the rivalry between eternal 'frenemies' novelist Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn) and Madeline Ashton (a wickedly funny Meryl Streep), rapidly fading star of stage and screen. Helen never met a man that Madeline didn't like - or couldn't steal away from her, and as the movie opens, her latest stolen conquest is Helen's so-to-be-ex-boyfriend, the noted plastic surgeon Dr. Ernest Menville, (an uncharacteristically schlumpy Bruce Willis). Marrying a doctor still is no guarantee for eternally youthful looks, and an offhand comment from Madeline leads to a meeting with a very weird stranger (Ian Ogilvy) at her favorite spa. Although she takes the card that this creepy guy offers, Madeline tosses it aside, writing him off as the usual nutcase.That is until she meets the ""new and improved"" Helen! Once driven to morbid obesity and intensive therapy by Ernest's abandonment and her ""friend's"" umpteenth betrayal, ""former fatty"" Helen is now a super-svelte knockout, who makes the once-divalicious Madeline look like a checkout counter queen at the local Target. Suddenly, at the end of her Revlon-slicked rope, Madeline remembers the card and the weird guy at the spa. She discovers the same 'beauty secret' that Helen did, and that's where the movie kicks into hysterical high gear...A barbed-wire wrapped valentine to celebrity, vanity and the superficiality of sex-symbol status, not just in Hell-Lay, but America in general, horror-comedies don't come much funnier, feistier or fulfilling than this. Streep and Hawn have never been better as a match made in Helene Curtis Hell, and Bruce Willis actually dusts off the acting chops that shot him to leading man status in the first place, here doing a great job as 'Joe-Schmoe-with-a- scalpel' who realizes too late just how far in over his head he is. And in a really funny self-mocking cameo, Isabella Rossellini matches the top-notch principals eyebrow-to-plucked-eyebrow as the catalyst for all the craziness that eventually happens.If you've seen this before, but not in a while, just go ahead and buy it. You'll save a ton on re-rentals. And if you've never seen it, think of the best farce that could be made if John Waters met cute with Stuart Gordon and George Romero. Now think of that movie with an almost unlimited budget. On steroids.Pity that they don't make 'em like DEATH BECOMES HER more often.

70,FloatingOpera7,A Dark Fantasy Comedy Of The Early 90's,10,22 April 2006,"Death Becomes Her (1992): Starring Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn, Bruce Willis, Isabella Rosselini, Adam Storke, Ian Ogilvy, Alaina Reed Hall, Jon Ingle, Mary Ellen Trainor.. Director Robert Zemeckis, Screenplay Martin Donovan and David Koepp, Music by Alan Silvestri.Released in 1992, director Rob Zemeckis' ""Death Becomes Her"" (a joke on the phrase ""that dress becomes her, that hat becomes her"") is an enjoyable dark comedy out of the early 90's. Far better written than most comedies of the time, this film relied on the chemistry of the principal actors- Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis- and a tale of biting satire and social commentary enhanced through eye-popping visual effects. Meryl Streep hams it up as Madeline Ashton, a washed-up, aging film and stage actress who hits rock bottom when her latest Broadway performance meets with harsh criticism. Her long-time rival Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn) attends the performance and introduces Madeline to her successful surgeon/mortician husband Dr. Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis). Madeline and Helen have long fought not over him, but over which of them would become the greater success. Madeline steals Ernest from Helen. Now that Madeline has the upper hand, Helen sinks into depression, grows fat and is institutionalized in a mental hospital. She is bent on getting revenge. Years later, Helen writes a book for women on keeping beautiful and Madeline, who is now aging herself, attends the book signing. Helen has become a beautiful thin and youthful looking woman. Madeline and Ernest are stuck in an unhappy marriage, Madeline feels unattractive and becomes bitchier and bitchier. She resolves her crisis through a visit to the eccentric and reclusive Madame Lisle Von Rhoman (Isabella Rosselini in a great performance) who offers her an elixir that not only stops the aging process dead in its track, but grants her immortality. Later we discover that Helen had also taken the potion. Helen orders Ernest to kill Madeline, which he does by pushing down a long flight of stairs. She comes back from the dead, however. The visual effects, which feature such unrealistic touches as Madeline's twisted neck and torso, and later, after Helen is killed, Helen's pale walking cadaver (those eyes are also computer graphics) are what most people remember fondly about this film. They are Tim Burton effects and one wonders why he didn't call dibs on this film. The music by Alan Silvestri is dark, brooding and haunting but could probably use a touch of comedic flair like the music of Danny Elfman (who wrote music for Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas and the recent Corpse Bride and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). This film is highly entertaining and well-written. The theme of women's obscessions with looks (Hollywood actress and their fans I'm talking about you!) as a huge detriment to one's humanity has never been more satirically captured. Because Madeline and Helen prioritize their youth and looks, they miss out on the true meaning of life and living forever- simply living for love, family, children, good deeds. Ultimately, they end up stuck for eternity with each other and they fall to pieces literally. There is much to admire in this film. Visually and cinematographically it's a feast for the eyes. It resembles a modern Gothic romance without any real romance (neither Madeline or Helen loved Ernest). Its a real blow to women's egos and sense of vanity. I especially love the surreal scenes such as the Nuns who seem to be floating down a hospital corridor as Ernest arrives at the morgue. At Madame Lisle's Spring Ball, held in her enormous castle in the Hollywood Hills, we see dead famous sex icons and actors looking young and alive including Elvis, Greta Garbo, Marilyn Monrie and Jim Morrisson!

72,ersinkdotcom,Stands the test of time when it comes to its dark humor and cautionary narrative,8,17 May 2016,"A star-studded cast headed up by Bruce Willis, Goldie Hawn, and Meryl Streep all give elegantly wicked performances based on a story by Martin Donovan (""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"") and David Koepp (""Jurassic Park,"" ""Panic Room"").In ""Death Becomes Her,"" two narcissistic arch rivals (Mery Streep and Goldie Hawn) discover the ultimate accessory – a potion that will keep them forever young – when they meet a mysterious enchantress (Isabella Rossellini) with deep ties to the Hollywood elite. But they get more than they bargained for when their newfound beauty only intensifies their vanity and rivalry.Bruce Willis is absolutely perfect playing against his typecast at a time when he was known as a raging action hero ready to take out anyone who crosses him or his family. Here he's a whimpering mess being led around by two women who take advantage of and mentally and verbally abuse him. Goldie Hawn and Meryl Streep are delightfully wicked as the two self-centered women who seek eternal life and servitude from Willis's character.Director Robert Zemeckis captures the black comedy of ""Death Becomes Her"" and blends it with a shot of social commentary to give it more depth. Cinematographer Dean Cundey pulls us into the movie through his use of modern Gothic settings and wonderfully moody lighting. All his hard work truly gives the movie a noir feeling that somehow still works even in color.If you look at the special visual effects through your 2016 glasses they appear dated. However, I remember seeing this movie when it came out 24 years ago and being visually dumbfounded by it. Industrial, Light, and Magic did an incredible job once again pushing the boundaries of their craft to a whole new level with ""Death Becomes Her.""The movie is rated PG-13 for some nudity and off-color humor. The only nudity is a shot of Isabella Rossellini's body double from the back showing her rear. There are quite a few cleavage shots here and there as well. ""Death Becomes Her"" also has profanity, alcohol drinking, and comic violence. ""Death Becomes Her"" is one of those films that stands the test of time when it comes to its dark humor and cautionary narrative. Sure, the primitive special visual effects stick out like a sore thumb at times when looking at it now. It's still a really enjoyable and entertaining film that explores the trappings of vanity, the dangers of chasing youth, and being afraid of growing old.",Death Becomes Her

When the find a secret way of staying young and living forever, they don't think about what would happen if they had an accident. This film is about these 2 women fighting over one man and the face and figure of a young person.I loved the special effects in this movie. Even today they are not bad at all. Very good in fact compared to a lot of movies that come out these days.The comedy I thought was a little bit weak. It was funny but I think I only laughed out loud once maybe twice, but the story is good so that keeps you entertained until the end.The acting was as you would expect from these guys. There is a great bunch of actors in this film and they act really well. The main cast were Meryl Streep﻿, Bruce Willis and Goldie Hawn. I heard in an interview recently that Goldie was returning to acting after 12 years off... that I look forward to. I always thought she was great, and she has made a lot of classic movies.The movie was directed by Robert Zemeckis. This man is a legend in the movie industry and is clearly one of the top directors around. If you look back at his directing career you will see so many fantastic movies against his name.

This movie is no exception, it possesses all the parts to make it a great and memorable movie. The actors that were chosen were, to put it short, amazing. Bruce Willis was extremely funny, as was Merly Streep, who really should make more comedies. The story is fresh and highly interesting as it shows a different portrayal of beauty.

80,mnpollio,Riotous showcase,9,7 May 2014,"There is a rule in film that special effects and comedy do not successfully mix and it is usually true. Yet every once in a while, a film will buck that trend and prove the exception to the rule. Ghostbusters is one example. This film is another.Meryl Streep stars as aging acting diva Madeline Ashton, whose quest for eternal youth and beauty is equaled only by her hatred of and rivalry with frumpy childhood acquaintance Goldie Hawn. When Streep once again steals Hawn's fiancée, this time a plastic surgeon played by Bruce Willis, Hawn has a psychotic break and is institutionalized, setting the stage years later for a battle royale that ultimately defies natural law and features plots, murder, mayhem and the undead.At the time this film was released, I would have been hard-pressed to recall any old-style broad slapstick comedies in the last decade or so, much less one anchored by two leading ladies at the peak of their form. Additionally, it is wonderful to see a wild, over-the-top comedy that does not feature characters sputtering profanities every two seconds or showcase a joke regarding someone humping a pie or other bizarre sex act. Everything in the film is played broadly and the comedy comes at us both verbally and visually. The approach, pitch-perfectly directed by Oscar-winning Robert Zemeckis, works brilliantly and captures the frenetic pace of a great Warner Brothers cartoon.The look of the film is inspired with a tone that almost seems like a cross between Sunset Boulevard and a Gothic horror film. The cinematography is lush and the visual effects complement rather than upstage the wild comic antics. I especially like the surreal visuals of the comedic sequence where Hawn outlines her plot to Willis of how they will murder Streep and make it look like an accident. I also enjoy the eerie and funny sequence where Willis goes in search of Streep in a morgue and passes three floating nuns en route.Streep and Hawn are simply terrific here, playing archetypal characters with the right broad strokes needed to keep us glued to what happens next while realizing that these two people deserve each other and what comes their way. It is such a delight to see Streep cut loose and have a field day, although Hawn matches her nicely. Streep's choking reaction to seeing the newly svelte Hawn at a book launch is priceless and her facial expressions while eavesdropping to find out what is going on are superb. I also like her interactions with Isabella Rossellini, as a purveyor of an exotic and very expensive youth restorer. The screenplay is filled with memorable comic jibes that allow all of the performers moments to shine and Zemeckis provides some great slapstick set pieces for the actors to show off their physical chops. Willis, whose performances far too often are split between lifeless or smug, is particularly droll and inspired here making a hilarious transformation from a confident surgeon to a drunk balding, paunchy milquetoast mortician constantly overwhelmed by the events around him.The final sight gag of the film often takes people by surprise, but I find it a perfect natural progression of the limitless mayhem unleashed by the lead characters. You can keep the repellent and appalling comedy of the Hangover films, I would much rather spend time with Streep and Hawn, and I have found that whenever I stumble across this film on cable, it is often just a funny as when I first saw it on its release.",Death Becomes Her
81,rollernerd,Forever youthful and damned,5,23 September 2020,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**
Today's movie review is the black comedy Death Becomes Her (1992) where two giant actors, Goldie Hawn and the queen herself Meryl Streep play as two rival friends who try to outmatch each throughout their lives including having a great body and stealing their partners. Soon each come across a pathway to immortality however it does come with a cost. The movie itself is not just about eternal youth but what happens when you have life long grudges.
The movie for me had one great moment - the cameo appearance by Sidney Pollack. Other then that I didn't enjoy this movie and won't go back watching it. Bruce Willis also stars in this flick as the love interest in the middle, who does his usual excited and terrified at the same time. Streep does well up against Hawn by portraying their superficial, slightly psychotic characters whether through the back and forth banter or fighting each other with shovels. Hawn early transition to a deep depression was also amusing. However, the movie just did not do it for me, there were a few laughs here and there but nothing too hilarious. Given this movie is an oldie, the special effects are quite good and still do manage to stand up today's standards. The humor is pretty much as dark as it can get, but as mentioned there seems to be something missing, which is too bad, as it has a very good point. Overall, 5.8/10",Death Becomes Her
82,The Creeper,A Complete Waste of Anyone's Time,1,21 February 2002,"Death Becomes Her has to be one of the Worst Movies ever Made. I Don't understand how someone could classify this as a Comedy Movie. There are NO Laughs. In Addition to no Laughs, we have little Plot and bad overall Direction. The Acting is not to Brilliant either. Because it has Little Plot is not what ruins this Movie; I've seen a lot of Movies with Bad Acting, No Plot, and Little Direction that Result in 90 Minutes of Pure Entertainment, but this Movie is just Horrible.Why would someone Even Kind of Like This Movie sure beats the Royal Crap out of Me. It Hate it. I usually never Write Negative Reviews, but couldn't help myself with this Garbage.This Movie is Horrible. Hideous. Terrible. Pathetic. Boring. Besides ""Motel Hell"", This is the Worst Movie ever and a Complete waste of Anyone's Time.I WARN YOU; DON'T SEE THIS.People who want to find a good comedy should check out: Senior Trip, Dude Where's my Car, Dumb and Dumber, Man on the moon, Liar Liar, Austin Powers, and Tommy Boy.",Death Becomes Her
83,EvanKevelson,I divided the halves and divided by 2,5,30 July 2020,In concept this could have remained an excellent comedy that utterly turns around when Goldie Hawn & Meryl Streep reconcile their differences. Bruce Willis who has been underutilized as a comedic actor (For anyone who has seen Moonlighting). But is utilized as a Cornball sap barely utilized. Rick Moraines would be more qualified. The film went from a 9-10 on a dark comedy scale to 0-1. With the funeral ending I debated giving this a three but that wouldn't be fare. It's a brief scene and just dragging out a lame story line.,Death Becomes Her
84,buzznzipp1995,But Not Him...,9,31 August 2007,"I have never really been a Goldie Hawn fan, until this came along. I had seen her in other things, but never really put it to brain, that I really enjoyed her stuff. But here, is a fast fun and totally fantasy driven story of Beverly Hills and the rich women who have some one to compete with. Enter Meryl Streep! I was a fan from the finish of the film, 'Silkwood' (1983) with Cher and Kurt Russell, what a strong performance, she brought to that. Karen, (the main female lead) who Streep was portraying in 'Silkwood', she did, I say with zero regret. She delivered 100%. Now, Goldie comes into this story, and by the way I have always loved Kurt Russell, her man's roles. Kurt has the 'goods' when it comes to big or small screen. But as for Goldie this Zemekis directed fun-weirdo fest was just what got me thinking, ah, Goldie Hawn...wow! I loved the story, a woman learns of a potion that will enable her to live beyond life and cross-over to immortality. She has to have it to out do her rival, that stole her man when she (Goldie) was overweight and a sniveling loser. Actually, she was just Miss understood. Bruce Willis, her boyfriend turned Streep's character's husband, brought a wonderfully colorful old guy character that had a whimsical sense, not unlike Television's happier days 'Moonlighting's' D.A. (David Addison) but, not being Addison. Versatile, versatile, versatile, that is what Willis can be and it amazes me.He was the frustrated older Doctor (and genius) that got caught between a rock and a hard place, in ""Death Becomes Her"" (1992) Willis had that older confused, then suddenly enlightened Dr. Ernest Menville down. I can't see someone doing just what he did in that role. I laughed and laughed some more. Meryl as Madeline or 'Maddy' Ashton, was a wonderfully conceited, pain in the ass character, complete with menacing attitude when she wanted her way desperately more than to do the right thing. She pushed and she pulled, until Ernest could bare it all no more. Even when both women, Helen and Maddy wanted for the good Doctor to go along with them on their immortal adventure. He simply cut and ran, leaving them well behind.Director Robert Zemeckis, has a way of bringing out and presenting his story in such a way that brings you to a totally visual as well as audio understanding of the situation, I think and not simply a well made over-view. He has a way with comedy/drama that is highly satisfying...i.e ""Back To The Future"" Tri-series (1985-1990)to his simpler and belly laugh-funny ""UsEd CaRs"" (1980) Robert is one of my all time favorite directors. The cast was the fun and the story set the entertainment level on the events played out just right and the ending even, was a nice turn that made the joke on the two vindictive, greedy rich opportunist tramps in competition with each other, to a little more dependent more of a team effort. Even though through the end from what they should have learned they are still not, straight players, even when they both depend on each other for that. This was a great time. A date-night fun romp, or even solo. But I recommend a good bottle of wine and a date anytime over alone. (***)",Death Becomes Her
85,BadWebDiver,Dark social parody,9,24 April 2002,"This is a great black comedy of the perpetual yearn for the Fountain of Youth elixir, particularly for people in show-business and other looks-orientated professions.It opens with a fun spoof musical number, then deals with the current obsession with fads, philandering and self-help guides of the social elite. Then it really kicks into sci-fi fantasy territory with some of the most outstanding fx shots up until that time.Bruce Willis is barely recognizable in his role as a nerdish doctor. Meg Ryan goes from thin to fat to ravishing in a very convincing manner, and manages to play the role that ranges from dumped housewife to media celebrity without breaking a sweat. And as for Meryl Streep, she definitely cements her place in my book as ***the*** most talented actress alive today with the demonstration of her fantastic comic delivery; both here and in SHE DEVIL. Isabella Rossellini is also perfectly cast as the mysterious vamp. And Robert Zemeckis is certainly one of my top favorite sci-fi/comedy directors today.The story does lose its steam and peters out towards the end; but for the most part it's a real hoot of a dark comic ride.",Death Becomes Her
86,Gideon24,"Meryl, Goldie, and Robert Zemeckis knock it out of the park.",9,9 April 2015,"Director Robert Zemeckis, whose directorial resume rivals directors like Spielberg, Scorsese, and Sidney Lumet, made a strong impression with Death Becomes Her, a delicious 1992 black comedy that combines refreshingly human and flawed characters with an over the top story and some eye-popping visual effects.This is the story of Madeline Ashton (Meryl Streep), an extremely vain actress and Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn) a writer, who have been professional and personal rivals since childhood and have been fighting over the same man for years, a nerdy plastic surgeon named Dr. Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis). It is revealed that, in a search for eternal youth, both women have taken a magic potion that has some unforeseen side effects, driving the good Dr. Menville crazy and yet somehow bringing the women closer together.This film has a lot going for it and at the top of the list is a dazzling, Oscar-worthy performance by Streep as Madeline Ashton...Streep hits all the right notes here, offering a character with equal parts of vanity and bitchiness. Streep has rarely been this entertaining on screen and I think the fact that this film is a comedy had a lot to do with her being overlooked at Oscar time. I think this performance is better than half a dozen of the performances for which she did receive nominations. Hawn beautifully underplays in a less showy role but compliments Streep perfectly. Isabella Rossellini is appropriately ethereal as the keeper of the magic potion and mention should also be made of a brief but funny appearance by director Sidney Pollack as a doctor examining Streep. It's fun seeing Streep and Pollack on screen together seven years after he directed her in Out of Africa. My main problem with the film is Bruce Willis' character, Dr. Ernest Menville. Nerdy is OK, if there is a sexiness going on like Ryan O'Neal in What's Up, Doc?, but there's nothing sexy about this character. Why these two women are so obsessed with this guy doesn't make sense nor does his attraction to Madeline and Helen. He doesn't appear to really have feelings for either woman but it takes way too long for him to separate himself from these women.This film did win an Oscar for Outstanding Visual Effects and this is one that the Academy got right...the visuals here are just dazzling and more importantly, imaginative, not the kind of things you normally associate with standout visual effects. Watch the subtle changes in Madeline's body when she takes the potion or the hole in Helen's stomach when she gets shot or the final destruction of the ladies' bodies in the extremely effective finale. Throw in a smart screenplay by Martin Donovan and David Koepp, a superb musical score by Alan Silvestri, and the master directorial hand of Robert Zemeckis and you have a winner.",Death Becomes Her
87,richspenc,"Some really good, a few creepy bits",7,12 March 2017,"Do people really want to live forever? This idea for shows and movies have been used numerous times going back to Twilight zone episodes ""Escape clause"" and ""Long live Walter Jamison"". In both those episodes, the main character finds out that they eventually get tired of living when they know it will be eternal. That doesn't happen in ""Death becomes her"" with the two leads Madelyn (Meryl Streep) and Helen (Goldie Hawn), but the concern of getting tired of living if alive forever is brought up by Earnest (Bruce Willis) when the eternal potion is offered to him. He doesn't look at eternal life as a miracle, even though he yells that line after discovering Madelyn's secret. We get a creepy twist; your body, if you don't take the proper care of, will start to rot after taking the potion even when they're moving and talking just like they're alive. Basically, they're still alive while the body is technically now a dead corpse, and will continue to rot and decay just like any dead corpse. Therefore, the end scene with Madelyn and Helen is not easy to look at for sensitive squeamish eyes. But you'll only rot after taking the potion if you do something to your body that would've normally killed you before taking it. That explains why Isabel (the rich potion dealer) still looks great many years later, but Madelyn and Helen don't (due to Madelyn breaking her neck after getting pushed down the stairs and Helen getting shot).Early on, in a Broadway theater, people are streaming out mid show badmouthing the show big time. I sort of see why, the show was like a combo of a bad imitation of classic showgirl dancing, disco sounding music thrown in for some reason, and Madelyn singing in a flat unenthusiastic voice. I didn't see any real dancing talent and according to one of the badmouthers walking out, the story was a cheap ripoff from something better. I would've walked out with them. After the show (with Earnest being the one applauding), Helen introduces fiancé Earnest to Mad to see if he'll pass the Madelyn test. He does NOT, to say the least. Earnest immediately leaves Helen and marries Mad, leaving Helen clutching her fists so tight that there's blood. I kinda liked that. I also sort of liked the part where Helen gained like 100 pounds (very convincing fat suit, like the fat suit Gweneth Paltrow wore in ""Shallow Hal""). Helen basically gave up on life spending her time stuffing herself with tons of junk food including eating entire cans of frosting on their own, rewatching scenes in Mad's movies where she's getting killed and wishing it were real. She's then put in an asylum. Next scene years later, we learn that right after leaving the asylum, Helen took the potion. There should've been a scene showing Helen taking the potion showing us seeing the special effects of her suddenly losing all that weight and looking much younger again. Present time (1992), Mad is tired of hubby Earnest (now noticeably older and worn down looking) drinking, indulging in self pity, and never being able to please her anymore (he's become flaccid). That's why Mad cheats on Earnest with some young guy. Then she catches the young guy with a young girl, and Mad freaks out driving all crazy dodging cars. I saw that situation as a ""what goes around, comes around"" deal, since Mad previously stole a man away from someone herself, and was now cheating on one man to be with another. Then Mad meets a sort of effeminate French man at her health spa after getting jealous of the young beauty who's working on her. He gives Mad a card for a ""very select group"". We then get the great potion scene at the fancy secluded palace of Isabell, the young beauty (looking very sexy with what she wears) who's really elderly but has taken the potion. I saw the sign of Isabel really being older than she looked with her revealing having served Greta Garbo. The reference to her having known Garbo may've gone over some people's heads. I just knew it from Isabella's ""I vant to be alone"" comment, since I've seen and own Garbo's ""Grand hotel"". About the cost of the potion, there's a sight on this movie where people were debating the cost of the potion since we don't get a good look at the check Mad wrote to Isabell. One million dollars was people's best guess, that's why mainly celebrities were the ones at the Palace (we see Elvis in a scene there, and that was also a good play on the whole ""is Elvis really dead?"" theme (and the ""I saw Elvis in a mall"" theme)). After Mad takes the potion, we see the first of many special effects when we see Mad's body suddenly getting younger. It's next where the first gruesome effects take place where Mad and Helen have horrible incidents, getting pushed down the stairs and getting shot with a double barrel shot gun, but are still alive and have very graphic visual ""injuries"" from it. A lot of the films remainder is centered around that. And that's why in my opinion that part of the film was not as good. Then is the scene of Mad and Helen trying to get Earnest to take the potion and Earnest's visit with Isabell (who again looks very sexy coming out of that pool). Too many scenes in the last part of the movie of Mad and Helen starting to decay, and them relying on Earnest to patch them up. The scene in the hospital with the doctor creeped me out too when he had a heart attack after seeing that Mad was dead but also still alive, too much for him to handle, I guess.",Death Becomes Her

93,pekinman,Great Junk Food for the Eye,7,7 March 2009,"'Death Becomes Her' is not a movie to be taken seriously but it's a lot of fun and occasionally very funny. It's basically a knockabout, slapstick farce based on the time-honored roasting of Hollywood and its legends, both human and mythical.The production values, music, cinematography, sets, costumes, hair etc are great. The f/x are splendid and ingenious for the most part. Some of the puppetry doesn't quite come off but by the time we reach that point in the story we don't care about realism at all.The cast is unbeatable. A great comedy team. I wouldn't have thought Bruce Willis could transform himself from super-hero (which was never really very convincing if you ask me) to a nerdy plastic surgeon cum mortuary make-up artist. He's extremely funny and delivers a number of memorable lines that in other hands would have amounted to nothing. Oddly, he's sexier as a drip than as a superman. Isabella Rossellini is stunning, even more so than usual. She is also a master comedienne on the evidence of her subtle and daffy performance as the mysterious Liesl the creator of an eternal life potion.Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn complete this wonderful cast. It takes about half the movie before they come into their own, after they are 'dead', and are battling out eternity together, cutting and pasting parts of each other back on to their petrified bodies. The last scene in the church is particularly bitchy, some might even say misogynistic. I know a few women who detest this movie for that reason, but they don't particularly have very good senses of humor and often fail to be able to laugh at themselves.If you CAN laugh at yourself and the failings of the frail human animal then you will enjoy this bit of first-rate fluff. It's almost a family film, almost, because there is some nudity, the lovely Rossellini who is really more of a Greek sculpture than a naked body. There are very few swear words and the violence is in the nature of a cartoon. The whole thing is good-natured in a twisted fantasy, dark sort-of way.I get the impression that the screenwriters came up with this idea while enjoying some exotic substance at a pad in Malibu on a balmy summer's evening. A bit sophomoric and not as funny as they may have thought it was at the time, but much of it succeeds in amusing, and it's certainly tasty eye-candy throughout.The pitch for this flick would be something like Norma Desmond meets Baby Jane Hudson.",Death Becomes Her
94,thomvic,It's Streep's performance that stands out the most...,6,18 October 2010,"This has played on TV so many times but I never watched it from beginning till end. Having watched it all fully, it all makes sense now.I think there's a lot we don't fully get in this movie, but I think you don't really care. This is simply a dark comedy and the performances from the three main actors are just fun and hilarious. Streep in particular, is probably the most funniest character in the film and Goldie Hawn is also fine. Bruce Willis is very convincing as the geeky plastic surgeon who leads a life of boredom.I think however, the film seems to not make you care so much about the characters as they seem quite one dimensional and the only purpose the two women have is to become young and beautiful in order to get a guy. The plot becomes a bit stupid near the end when they try to get Bruce Willis to drink the potion and seems to lose its interest in the tension between the two women.Also, how did Helen (Hawn) get the potion in the first place and how much did she fork out to get it? How did Helen and Madeline (Streep) attend the funeral of Bruce Willis's character when he was trying to hide from them?

As conversations or question of immortality arises, I found myself quoting or referencing the movie.Because the movie is so watchable after so many viewings, I think this is a classic movie. It is about two woman trying to steal a man and fighting over their differences and jealousy. These woman wants to pursue immortality while another man wants to choose mortality and live a full life. It is the question of superficiality and immortality that struck me deep. The other issue is the desire to find that fountain of youth at the same time. The issues are as old as time. How do you feel when someone comes to you and say ""You are old!"". That was one of the phrases when a young man complains to Meryl Streep. These are some of the things you will ponder.Bruce Willis really surprise me this one as he no longer plays the tough man image.

Plus, the plot is completely original and (by me anyway) unpredictable. Even the minor scene with Meryl Streep being examined by the doctor is among the most memorable of comedic pastiches, which will delight even seasoned medical professionals.As viewed on laserdisc 7 years after it's release, DEATH BECOMES HER holds its age well and conjures up laughs even on repeat viewing.

She's always quite a good actor and she does this movie justice even if isn't one of my favourite actors 0=]This movie is funny, it does have a quite good storyline and it also manages to develop into something which is quite good and worth watching at the end 0=] I loved it and hope that you do as well!",Death Becomes Her

106,travisvincent,Death becomes me,10,19 December 2006,"Death becomes her is one of my all time favorite movies. Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis are in top form and deliver one of the best performances i have seen. Meryl Street (Madeline Ashton) plays a has been movie star who once had a huge career. Goldie Hawn, (Helen) plays an insecure woman about to get married to a top surgeon Bruce Willis. High School rivalries have never come across any better as the film is a back and forth between Helen trying to outdo and outwit Madeline, or as they affectionately call themselves, Hell and Mad. They each have taken a potion to stop the aging process. while they don't know it at first, it is quickly realized when first, Mad falls down the stairs and breaks her neck and twists it 180 degrees...and shes still alive. then, in a moment of revenge later, Hell is shot through the stomach with a 12guage gun and moments later..she's still alive. to which Bruce Willis exclaims--its alive!! what follows is one of the funniest scenes in a black comedy i haven't seen in years as hell and mad go head to head trying to kill each other until they realize, they cant die. then then go for Bruce Willis, to get him to take the potion so that he may live forever as well (but only so that he can do their make-up) they don't succeed in changing him as the end of the movie shows him dead and they are still alive and in one piece, until they fall down the stairs and break into a scatter of pieces.

Helen is currently in love with Dr Ernest Menville, played by Bruce Willis, but Madeline steals him as well and they get married.  Years later, Helen and Madeline both take a potion that allows them to be immortal and beautiful forever.  Helen returns to try and win Ernest back, but when Helen and Madeline both die, they stay alive (due to the potion) and they must rely on Ernest to save their skin from rotting.For a black comedy, I must comment on this film's lack of laughs.  I don't recall once in the whole movie when I laughed.  The plot is preposterous and absurd and the acting isn't too hot, either.  I didn't even really enjoy the characters, and the ending climax was also quite poor.  However, the academy-award winning visual effects of Death Becomes Her provide the only real satisfaction.  They include people with heads turned backwards, holes in their stomachs, and nice rotting skin.  However, Death Becomes Her is a poor black comedy without laughs.

True, there's the pilates and avocado salads, but what if you could have it all just by taking a shot? You'd take it, I bet you would. I would. As the society of today is only getting more and more paranoid and fixated on the culture of youth, this movie's message should only get more important. We are not that far away from creating the potion of eternal youth, and surely we're far closer than we were in 1992 when the movie was made. And the questions posed by the makers, and even answered by them in the very next lines, should only be remembered fonder: what do we get if we erase a part of life, the death, from the process of life? What will really happen? Sure, this movie is a comedy: a black comedy of course, but still a comedy, not too be taken too seriously and surely not a motto to live your life by. And yet, I can't shake the feeling that the creators had a more significant message to portray, other than ""don't shoot your friend in the stomach after drinking the potion or she'll be saying goodbye to bikinis forever"". ""Death Becomes Her"" is one of those movies that guarantee great entertainment (but it's kind of a given with Streep, Hawn and Willis as the top three) and on top of it all, give you something to think about, even merely 17 years after it's been released.",Death Becomes Her

Willis easily outshines both Streep and Hawn in this movie. This is a pure black comedy, a brilliant social satire on society's obsession with beauty and the sheer lengths some people will go to to ensure that they are continually perceived by others in the most attractive light possible. Truly a once in a lifetime experience this movie, with Bruce Willis giving one of his most underrated performances ever!

Menville is a wimpy alcoholic who starts out as a successful plastic surgeon. Until he meets Madeline(Meryl Streep) a rather gorgeous actress. Despite her looks Madeline is insecure, self-obsessed, self-involved and just plain selfish. With this actress in his life, and with help from a lot of alcohol, Bruce Willis(Ernest Menville) the guy becomes an embalmer type. A mortician. Helen(Goldie Hawn) is more than smitten. She is furious and hates Madeline now. Goldie Hawn does what she does best in this hilarious movie. She takes drama or action or horror or any genre and transforms that media into comedy. At Helen's party Madeline has been linked to the gorgeous alchemist played by Isabella Rosellini. The actress has the opportunity to consume a vial of the ""water of life"" or eternal youth. And so do other characters. Later fate takes an evil turn and Streep finds that she has many strange powers. Some are very funny powers, and the special effects are great. There is an undercurrent of satire, in the sense that the men and women of Tarzana want to be wanted strictly from the physical beauty they have. It is difficult to discriminate what Meryl Streep looks like, because I consider her to be a beautiful woman, no matter how she's dressed or the amount of makeup she wears. When Willis is offered the supernatural potion by Van Rhoman, he is indecisive about taking the concoction.",Death Becomes Her

I don´t consider this movie gives an answer to that, but it represents one over-exaggerated view - a particularly well-carried out view.

The acting was terrific, as well as the Oscar winning visual effects.  Meryl Streep was new to the comedy world, and she pulled it off brilliantly. Goldie Hawn was also fabulous and Bruce Willis was outstanding as the caught-in-the-middle husband.

And not just any Meryl Streep, but Meryl Streep playing the part of a washed-up, husband-grubbing actress, which is obviously such a stretch for her that viewers are treated to stunning feats of dramatic fitness. Bruce Willis also impresses in an uncharacteristic role for him -- an alcoholic former plastic surgeon who can't get out from under the thumb of the women in his life.Turns campy and morbid, Death Becomes Her has that Jawbreaker, Drop Dead Gorgeous vibe, but centers on middle aged adults grappling with their imminent decay. Oh, and there's magic.If you're jonesing for slapstick-y dark comedy, this will totally work for you. There are tons of role reversals, undead she-devils and jokes about corpses. The visual effects seemed pretty whatever to me, but I guess they garnered an Academy Award (in '92), so what do I know?",Death Becomes Her
121,Franco-23,Great approach to this topic. Streep shines!!,9,13 July 1999,"To develop a topic such as eternal youth, you have to be very creative, have likeable characters and ideally some visual effects.  This film has it all. The way the story builds up is superb, Streep acting is wonderful (Hawn's too). The dialogue between Rossellini and Streep is one of my all time favorites. The FX are a masterpiece. I would have given this film a ten, but some scenes towards the end are a little repetitive. In my opinion this is a must see ""noir"" film. 9/10",Death Becomes Her
122,robertlauter25,about as pleasant as diarrhea gas,2,29 June 2013,"This movie is supposed to be a dark comedy, but it's not funny so that leaves dark. The production is good, the storyline could have been made funny if the script writers had been up to the task, but they weren't. Streep and Hawn throw one liners out that are literally painful. And what kills me is the same people who attack early 90's comedies like The Adventures of Ford Fairlane and My cousin vinney defended this garbage. Bruce Willis is not believable as a brow beaten wimp, sorry, he's a great actor ..but even Wells and Olivier knew their limitations. Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson would have turned this role down and I bet Bruce Willis wishes he had. It was most likely a backroom deal to emasculate the Action actor, as we know feminism was all the rage in the Murphy brown era Hollywood lexicon. I guess Willis was smart, he ate crow and made this horrible film and survived. There was a pattern of this going on at about this time in Hollywood of this period. We see a virtual exodus, Willis, Stalone and Schwarzeneggar all moved into comedy to soften up their image, of these Schwarzenegger adjusted the best. While others like Segal and Van Damn found themselves drummed out of Hollywood for their refusal to diversify. or went to TV as chuck Norris did. Some would quip that these men lacked the talent to do comedy. Well this is the only comedy I've seen with Meryl Streep and it was awful, so I guess the martial arts crowd should have taken a shot before running for the hills, because they couldn't have possibly done any worse.. In any event this movie has all the trappings of that unique point in history. all the male characters are demeaned and degraded in an orgy of gender bending after Gloria stienams own heart, while the two aging superstars spit venom at one another, and show off what's left of their aging bodies.

It's not enough that she's been wringing-out the last of her fifteen-minutes of fame by appearing in ridiculous plays, potboiler movies, and all the while making endless trips to her Beverly Hills plastic surgeon... She also has to steal and marry her friend Helen's fiancée (a star struck 'Dr. Ernest Menville,' played by Bruce Willis). Helen, an aspiring writer, is absolutely distraught and goes on an intense eating binge. Soon, time catches up with Madeline's vanity and Helen's extremely slow metabolism, to say nothing of the simmering grudges they already had between them.Boy, fourteen-years can really take a toll on one's body and mind! What happens next is at times predictable but nevertheless hilarious.'Hollywood Mockumentary, Satire, Black Comedy, Hilarious Romp'...it's all good! Call it what you like, I totally enjoy this comedy and recommend it highly. Despite actor Willis' presence, the obsession triangle between the principal players works (OK, actor Willis is photogenic, but you know from the outset that 'Madeline' doesn't really love 'Dr. Menville' because he makes women swoon). The acting trio's comedic timing is brilliant. Streep and Hawn are an ideal comedy pairing, taking turns playing the pitifully aging middle-aged celebrity and pancake made-up bitch....And you'll love watching Isabella Rossellini as 'Lisle Von Rhoman!'her voice is amaretto-smoothness, and her precision-paced acting makes for a delectable pseudo-villain. Lisle's Gothic 'wedding-cake' castle is also a gourmet eye feast (an ILM miniature, no doubt, since the building doesn't exist anywhere in Southern California).Supporting actresses Mary Ellen Trainor and Nancy Fish have each appeared in an episode of HBO's ""Tales from the Crypt"" (Trainor appears opposite character-actor Larry Drake in the ""And All Through the House"" 1989 episode remake); and Fish appears in the film in which Drake is the maniacal ""Dr. Giggles"" (1992). Fish and ex-model-hunk Fabio (playing one of Lisle's bodyguards) both appeared in ""The Exorcist III.""

From Helens entrance of the house, to Ernests sudden fading, it's original and soo far out it cracks you up.

I love the vain, shallow characters of Madeline and Helen who are the ultimate example of what might happen if you took the advice of our ""obsessed-with-perfection"" media to its illogical conclusion. Meryl and Goldie play their parts with unrestrained enthusiasm, pushing them to the limit to emphasise that these two who believe they are truly beautiful are, after all, just caricatures of perfection. Like Icarus, Mad and Hell take no advice and pursue the unattainable regardless of the cost. That they see every mountainous obstacle as a mere minor inconvenience helps reinforce the humour of the film. Bruce Willis is marvellous as Ernest, the unhappy mouse caught in the middle of their game; the voice of reason amid lunacy.The writing is witty and sometimes painfully sharp, emphasising in almost every scene that beauty does not equal happiness, and the closer you come to attaining an obsessively pursued physical perfection, the further you get from real happiness and fulfillment. Stylistically our attention is focused on this concept over and over again, with mirrors and reflections used very creatively throughout the film.We don't see a lot of clever satire these days, which is a pity.

When your cast list includes Bruce Willis, Isabella Rosselini and Meryl Streep, you would think the result would be at least halfway decent, but no such luck i'm afraid. The entire movie is filled with scenes that simple make you shake your head because the scenes that are supposed to be funny, are just downright embarrassing while the rest are just bad filler. Ten years ago I made the (huge) mistake of going to see it at the cinema, and it is the only movie where i've demanded my back afterwards.

Robert Zemeckis presides over nearly flawless technical work here, but the script is unfunny, misogynistic and ill-conceived. So, how does a film this bad get made? Internet Movie Database is the perfect tool to provide perspective on this stinker of a movie. Just look at the work that everyone involved was doing around the 1992 release date. Bruce Willis had fine-tuned his comedy skills in Moonlighting, exploded the box office in the action comedy Die Hard, and would follow a few more duds with Pulp Fiction in 1994. Meryl Streep was coming off a decade of strong dramatic performances and would succeed in the action film The River Wild in 1994. Goldie Hawn has a proved track record in comedies, just watch most of her work before this movie and enjoy. Isabella Rossellini is at a career peak here. Alan Silvestri provides a score that is worth seeking out and listening to as an audio-only experience. Zemeckis sandwiched this mess between the Back to the Future films and Forrest Gump.

The film has supernatural and fantasy elements with some superlative special effects and top notch acting performances by three talented thespians. Streep and Hawn play vain socialites who chance upon the elixir of life, with a hapless Bruce Willis caught in the mix. Robert Zemeckis is a great animator but also pays equal attention to the story which is why the special effects of his movies complete the story and not the other way around- and Death Becomes Her is a prime example of his mastery visualized for the screen.

I wish this film was shown near Halloween more often because it is such a fun romp. The aesthetics, set, and production design reminded me a lot of a Tim Burton movie, specifically Batman.

It has three excellent actors doing their best stuff here and their comic timing is never better than in this film. Bruce Willis is particularly good as the rather shell-shocked (wouldn't you be?) plastic surgeon - cum - undertaker.The main reason why this film is well-known now is because of it's *still* mind-boggling special effects used to a ghastly and very funny effect. It is also has a really fantastic sense of humour which never fails to raise a smile. All in all, a good, dark family film which is guaranteed to make everyone laugh. It does have some quite harrowing scenes (Meryl Streep being rather psychotic when a shotgun is in her hand), but I think that children should like it.

Meryl Streep is sensational and Bruce Willis is, I swear, unrecognizable in the best possible way. The movie hits the highest moments when, for instance, Meryl asks Isabella Rossellini how much the magic potion costs and Isabella replays: ""Oh the sordid topic of coin"" sublime, exquisite, funny but with enormous regard for its audience. But when Bruce calls Goldie Hawn to explain the ""incident"" at home he goes through a TV style monologue that seems to belong to a sit-com and not to the elegant vulgarity of this three sad, magnificent wannabees. The dialog, for the most part, is the best in any American serious comedy since Billy Wilder. The structure of the script is flawless and inventive. The costumes are atrocious and certain scenes seem directed by a 3rd assistant. I don't know how to explain it. However, I have it, I own it and sometimes I put it on with my finger in the fast forward. What's good is so good that makes the whole thing really worth it.",Death Becomes Her
142,igorrogov,Another underestimated classic,9,1 January 2015,"The characters in this movie are cartoonish indeed (that's why Roger Ebert dismissed it), but this is the whole point.This is a sort of broad and unflattering satire on predominant attitudes in our western pop culture that may leave a lots of people offended, - if they would really understand the message.Brilliantly acted, especially Bruce Willis who was cast against his usual screen self.Few twists in the plot to make you feel like you are on a roller-coaster ride.Very satisfying end, touching on the taboo subject - death and how it could be good, not feared.",Death Becomes Her
143,mike704,Ugly little annoying story,1,28 July 2001,"I had High hopes for this movie but if you have seen the trailer you have seen the best parts. I loved the special effects and hated everything else. Special effects alone are not enough. It might have worked better for me if it had been a silent movie.  I found the characters one dimensional and very annoying.  It would have been great to see a character with at least one redeeming quality.  Weak, vain, petty and stupid is how I would describe them.  Basically I would have been happy to see all of them die.  I guess the actors did what they could for this dud. I'm very fond of Goldie Hawn but she couldn't begin to save this film....0 stars for this one, I'd give it a minus star if that was possible.",Death Becomes Her

Thespecial effects are amazing and the gags just keep coming.There are so many witty lines that it's hard to remember them all.One of my favourites is when  Bruce Willis and Goldie Hawn planto murder Meryl Streep (who plays Willis' wife). They concoct anelaborate plot to push her car off Mulholland Drive, but Willis endsup pushing her down the stairs instead. After the deed is done hephones Goldie Hawn and breathlessly exclaims, ""Helen? I did it!She's dead, she started shouting at me and I couldn't take it anymore and I pushed her down the stairs and she's dead!"" There isa long pause on the other end of the phone, then Hawn slowlyasks , "". . . which part of the plan didn't you understand?"".Meanwhile, Streep is not dead, but is slowly standing up at the footof the stairs with her head on backwards!Isabella Rosselini is good as the mysterious Lisle von Rhumanand, at times, looks and sounds uncannily like her mother, IngridBergman.

She is still alive and after killing an enemy who used the potion they are condemned to living death forever rotting away. Bruce Willis character is needed to cosmetically make them look young forever, but he won't take the potion and escapes the mansion full of eternally young familiar faces and they are left alone with each other the scenes where the women come to life with the reason for their death still showing is great and ending is Ironic and funny too",Death Becomes Her
147,Flintenweibe,"Rather disappointing, but at least the effects were good",3,15 May 2020,"I started watching this film expecting a dark comedy centered on the twisted effects on the magical potion mentioned in the poster, and it delivers... ...about two thirds into the movie. Leading up to it is a drawn out shallow love triangle drama that's not particularly interesting and could have benefited from being shortened down without really losing much of either the plot or the comedy. Some of the comedy also have questionable humor, and it's not something I'd recommend for survivors of domestic abuse for one, but I wouldn't place this move in the same category as comedies that intentionally bank on being shocking and offensive , and the main message is centered on satirizing unhealthy obsession with looks and youth.The highlight of the movie i definitively when we see the two main characters fight one another after drinking the magical elixir and we see it's full effects on them (and the special effects are fantastic for a film from the 90s) while they simultaneously offer up some witty banter, but everything towards the end of the story feels rushed and the final scene, while meant to be comical, instead just felt disturbing with both main heroines seemingly stuck in a terrible situation impossible to get out of.All in all, if you'd already seen a few clips on the scenes with the big special effects, I wouldn't say that you'd gain much from seeing the rest of the movie.",Death Becomes Her
148,ptrubey-1,funny movie,10,30 May 2005,"I think this is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Goldie Hawn is great in it. It starts out that Goldie is engaged to Bruce Willis. At this time she is sort of over weight. Then they run into Meryl Streep who is a old friend/enemy of Goldies who always wanted everything that Goldie had so of course she go after him. And of course she is thin. Street & Willis get married and Goldie eats to stop the pain of loosing the man she loves. One day they are invited to a party by Goldie & when they get there and see her, she is thin & very beautiful. So now of course Willis wants her back. So it is a fight to the finish to see who get's him. The only thing is that both of the women have taken something that keeps them young but after a while things start to go wrong. At one point Streep shots Goldie and she is left with this big hole in her body but she can't die. Streep falls down a flight of stairs, break's her neck & her head turns backwards. the make up in the movie in the best. Willis becomes a drunk because he is in such a mess. He use to be a very famous doctor but now he only works on dead bodies. And the women are starting to peel so he is trying to help both of them. But they both hate him.

154,HorrorFan112490,Robert Zemeckis at his best!,8,28 August 2005,"I mean, I doubted this movie at first from the beginning in Broadway. But as it progressed, I was laughing so hard on certain scenes like when Dr. Menville is reporting the murder of Madelyn and she suddenly gets up and starts walking toward him. It was too funny and the effects were so phenomenal. I mean literally. But then again, it won an Oscar for its effects. I mean, the fight scene where the 2 start fighting with shovels and Helen breaks off the metal end of Mad's and she throws it right through her. ""Yes! I mean No! Oh Damn!"" That scene was just side-splitting. Overall it was a good black comedy and I'd recommend it to anybody. And Robert Zemeckis, I never knew he did such a great movie because he's a head producer for Dark Castle Entertainment and he's done some pretty bad movies from there like Ghost Ship and Thir13en Ghosts.

155,WolfDad,Streep needs to do more comedy,8,19 October 1999,"I'm not the biggest Meryl Streep fan in the world.  This movie, and Silkwood are my two Streep favorites.  Meryl Streep needs to do more comedy, because she fit in absolutely perfectly with Hawn and Willis, both comedy vets, and her timing was impeccable.The movie is a very good skewering of LA/Hollywood culture, and obsession with youth and beauty over honesty and integrity.  The f/x were hilarious (""I can see right ... through you"", Streep quips, after she's blown a hole thru Hawn's midsection), and the music reminiscent of a comedic ""Psycho"". This movie only gets better with repeat viewings, so you can memorize all the wonderfully catty dialogue, eg, ""In twelve years in Los Angeles have you ever seen a NEIGHBOR?!?"".  Too funny.",Death Becomes Her

In twelve years in Los Angeles, have you ever seen a neighbor???These lines basically sum up the sensibility of ""Death Becomes Her"", by Robert Zemeckis. Before directing the most overrated film of all time(""Forrest Gump""), Zemeckis was an intelligent and imaginative director who let seemingly normal characters explore the impossibilities our world presents, ala the toon town of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and the time travel premise of the ""Back to the Future"" movies. In this, Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn become awfully good looking zombies hell-bent on manipulating a very funny Bruce Willis into helping them stay young and beautiful, even when they're dead. Some of the funniest lines in film history are in this filmOne complaint: The part in the movie where Willis' doctor must debate as to whether or not he should drink the immortality potion while suspended in mid-air.

Bruce Willis is the one that has stolen the show in a role completely different from any of his other roles.

What makes it for me is the subtle face acting of the two leads whose comic timing is perfect. Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn have never been so good (plus this is the only film in which Bruce Willis doesn't do his trademark smirk even once).Every role is played to perfection and the script is a comedy work of art.I won't bother defending it to those people who need their jokes hammered home to them by comedy actors whose only way of getting a laugh is to gurn and fart.

And if anyone needs to be convinced, Death Becomes Her is just the ticket to get them Out of the Raspberry Patch, and into the Simple Truth. Meryl Streep is brilliant as Usual, and Goldie Hawn and Sydney Pollack are Fantastic, as well. But what sets this wonderful comedy apart is the unexpected comedic brilliance of one - Bruce Willis. Amazing job of totally turning his own image on it's head. Took Guts AND Talent.

All the while both ladies are cutting each other down with witty lines you'd usually hear from a drag queen. The lines get funnier each time I watch it.Elaborate sets and perfect deadpanned lines add perfect campyness to the movie. Some of the campy humour is easy to miss. In one scene she's swimming in a pool under a beautiful stain-glass ceiling, and because of the set it's easy to miss that she's wearing high heels as she comes out of the pool.

The review was dismissive and made a lot of sense, so I decided to give it a miss. What a terrible mistake! This is a movie I would love to see on a big screen. The script is so brilliantly clever. Disguised as a silly comedy there is a world of serious themes executed by a knowing cast. Meryl Streep in particular, playing convincingly an actress without talent. I remember the bad review criticized the writers for setting the story in a rainy, stormy Los Angeles when California was going through a drought. Imagine if a comedy about magic potions should worry about the accuracy of the weather. In fact the Los Angeles of ""Death Becomes Her"" feels more like Los Angelers than most realistic movies and it does it with nerve and wit. ""In 12 years in Los Angeles have you ever seen a neighbor?"" screams Meryl to his mousy Bruce. An absolute delight. Other hidden treasures are a cameo from Sidney Pollack and a very funny and very sexy ""76 years old"" Isabella Rossellini. A new cult classic and a total must.",Death Becomes Her

The story was original, the action well paced and the special effects were far ahead of their time. The casting was phenomenal, especially Meryl Streep. We all know what an incredible actress she is, but it was one of the first times I had seen her do full-on comedy, and by God did she deliver! Goldie Hawn was fantastic, as well as Bruce Willis, but for me Meryl was the best part of the whole film. One of the things that struck me about her performance was how much her character moved, spoke and reacted like a Bette Midler characterization. I know, call me crazy - but when you watch the movie next, watch Meryl's body carriage, her hand gestures, her timing and her inflection in certain scenes. It almost seems that she based her character on Bette at her bitchiest - think Ruthless People, or Down and Out In Beverly Hills. Just an observation, but see if you don't notice it for yourself. (Especially when Lisle stabs Madeline's finger to administer a sample of the potion, Madeline's little rant before Ernest pushes her down the stairs and the Morgue scene.) Above all, the dialogue was sharp, the insight into the whole 'anything for beauty' mindset was on the nose and the ending couldn't have been better.

175,coolwhipp100,Death never looked so good...,8,14 April 2006,"""Death Becomes Her"" is an exceptional look at dark comedy done right. Dark comedy is one of the trickiest genres in movies today because if not done right, you have an extremely uneven film on your hands.""Death Becomes Her"" is about aging in Hollywood which, according to Meryl Streep, is ""illegal."" ""Death Becomes Her"" is a fresh, original and satirical look at a classic and clichéd formula: growing old and the secret to eternal youth with a spin: it's effects on image-obsessed Hollywood. The strongest elements of this movie are the lively score, the award-winning special effects, and the highly enjoyable performances by Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis.""Death Becomes Her"" was Meryl Streep's first attempt at (dark) comedy and she outdoes even herself (""She-Devil"") with an energetic, brassy, loud, and devilishly good performance reminiscent to a blonde Velma Kelly (Chicago)...who's afraid to get older. Streep makes playing Madeline, a woman more concerned with getting older than her pathetic life, look effortless. Goldie Hawn plays her arch-nemesis, Helen and she commands the role with class and humor. Hawn gets the most out of this role and keeps you interested and charmed at the same time. Bruce Willis is surprisingly very good at playing Ernest, the man caught between these two women, and we get to see him in a role out of the ordinary in which he departs from action star to emotional weakling. The way he inhabits the role is so natural and polished it adds to the movie and makes sense of other two leads who are fighting over him. The actors play off of each other and even though the script is lacking (and gives these characters very little to work with), it's these inspired performances that carry ""Death"".The biggest problem with this movie is that in the end you have no one to root for, no one to care about, which is the script's fault entirely. The script falls flat but picks itself up, thus building momentum; falling from consistency to inconsistency, which helps keep the interest and helps keep the story alive, but it develops too many problems too late into the film. Finally, when there's about a half hour left everything begins to build up again and the momentum keeps building at you're awaiting a ""Bang!"" ending, when, ironically, the ending turns out to be anti-climatic. In the end, the script is just too campy and Robert Zemeckis can't save the film.In ""Death"" there are some similarities to other Robert Zemeckis movies but ""Death"" doesn't live up to his other creations. It's a movie entirely in it's own category and requires you to overlook the faults and get lost in the spirited performances.

To me they are like sisters that bicker throughout the movie. A wonderful satire of the vain attempts to be made young forever.

However, saying that this film is ""trash"" or ""horrible"" is to underestimate the real content within.Robert Zemeckis does a brilliant job of directing.  The artistic look of the film is haunting and gothic.  There is a great deal of symbolism contained in the film, which accentuates many underlying themes which the casual viewer would not normally recognize.  Start by researching the origin of the symbol found on the outside of the potion's box, for example.  After that, count the number of times a scene is filmed through a mirror.  (The number will astonish you.).This film has unfairly been called a lot of 4-letter words, and I'm at a loss to explain why.  The visual effects took home an Oscar in '93.  Many people say that Meryl Streep was terrible in this movie, but a Golden Globe nomination says differently.Sit back, relax, send the critic inside you to bed, look a little deeper, and give the film a chance.",Death Becomes Her
181,grandc93,Must-see-underrated-film of the decade!,8,9 March 2000,"Everything about this film is wonderful.  First, there's the acting. Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn, Bruce Willis, and Isabella Rossellini are outstanding, as always.  But it's Meryl Streep's unforgettable, deliciously evil performance as a vain, aging actress that really stands out.  She has many wonderful moments (so many, in fact, that I can't list or choose them--you'll have to see the film to understand) So what if she's been nominated for an Oscar 12 times all ready?  She deserved a nod for this role too.  She brought so many subtleties to her role that no other actress would have thought of and created, in my opinion, one of the greatest screen *itches since Bette Davis' Margot Channing in ""All About Eve"".  Second is the almost flawless direction of Robert Zemeckis.  His vision turned what could have been a ridiculous, mudane comedy, into an intelligently executed satire full of unforgettable images.  Third, is the script.  This has got to be one of the most original stories brought to the screen in years.  Some of the dialogue is cheesy, and I'm sure it looked horrid on paper, but the stars' razor-sharp wit and timing and Zemeckis' style  compensate for that entirely. Fourth, is the special effects which garnered the film an Oscar--'nuff said.  All of these elements, combined with Alan Silvestri's cynical underscoring, make this film a rare and brilliant treat.  Yeah, it's silly--but it's supposed to be!!! It's only the films that aren't meant to be silly that come off as crap when they appear absurd.  Almost no one will agree with what I'm about to say, but I think this film will eventually find it's way into the Classics section of video stores.  Hey, when ""Bringing Up Baby"" came out in 1938, it was considered trash--now it's considered one of the greatest movies of all time.",Death Becomes Her
182,dlingenfelter,"funny, up to the ending",10,15 June 2004,"I have seen this movie at least a dozen times and still find things to laugh at. >From the scene when Madeline falls down and breaks her neck to the ending where they both fly apart, it just does not get any better. I recommend this movie to any one wanting to see something completely different. This movie goes to prove that beauty is more than skin deep when it comes to the celebrities. I give this movie a 10 out of 10!Bravo!! to all three actors.",Death Becomes Her
183,marpicke3,death becomes her,10,30 June 2006,"I love all three of the stars in this movie, and I think it was clean funny and there should be more funny movies like that..There is to much sex, and killing in the movies and the 4 letter words are bad..The world has enough killing and bad words,the thought of living forever is wonderful if you don't get into trouble like mad and hell,the funnest part is when she fell down the stairs and came to life and said I can see My but, was very funny,no drugs,sex or anything like that just a good belly laugh...Meryl S is one of our greatest stars along with Goldie, both of there people I would love to meet, some stars you really like till you see them on a talk show, and all the love you had for them just flys out the window, with out a script they have no personalty and then you just don't feel the dame about them. I have seen both of these and they are just as nice. I can't wright to see the devil wares Prada, that looks so good.. come on Goldie make a new funny movie..love both of them",Death Becomes Her
184,cengizgursesnl,forever young,9,10 February 2007,"Death becomes her is one of my favorite films.First scene of Merly Streep's performance is very nice,to dance and sing with guys.Actually she's not very good to sing but its totally great,i think. I liked that. Goldie Hawn,she is always funny and beautiful.You see also beautiful Isabella Roselinni which is a very secret woman.She has the potion of youth. The last scene to fall from the steps front of the church,its really a finale. The music of Silvestri its a magic music.you will enjoy with also music. Madeline Aston an author Helen awaiting you,they need each other.I'll never forget this movie.You can laugh and laugh. I gave a nine points.",Death Becomes Her
185,Zombee,excellent black comedy,9,5 February 2003,"I don't usually write positive reviews but when i saw the very low rating(5.5!!) and the amount of negative reviews I couldn't help myself.I LOVE this movie, one of my all time favorites. To see people say its the worst movie ever made [and then recommend ""Dude, where's my car""] is laughable. Brilliant black comedy excellently acted by Meryl Streep, Bruce Willis and Goldie Hawn. I have to say, no one could have done a better job. Especially for Willis' character. It amazes me that its the same guy playing(quite well) a wussy, scientist geek who also played(quite well) a strong, macho type guy in the fifth element. He is INCREDIBLY believable as both.Between the reviews, plot outline and trailer on ""main details"" the plot of this movie has been well explained... so lets run over it again, shall we?(might be spoilers)Helen Sharp(Goldie Hawn) is dating Dr. Ernest Menville(Bruce Willis) who he later dumps for Helens dear old, friend Madeline Ashton(Meryl Streep), a recurring theme in poor Helens life. The break up affects Helen to a quite extreme level, lets just say she goes a little mad. 7 or so years later she comes back as a succesful novelist whilst Madeline is a washed up has-been who is obsessed with her rapidly fading looks and youth, demanding her house keeper to tell her each morning, ""Oh, madam! You look younger every day!""Helen tries to seduce her old love, more so for the fact that she wants him to be her partner in crime in the planned murder of his cheating wife.meanwhile(or maybe before or after) Madeline is depressed after being dumped by her much younger lover and buys a magical ""drink"" from Lisle Von Rhoman(Isabella Rossellini) that makes her younger.the satire of womens ego and their constant obsession with beauty and youth and how far it can go is brilliant. You may enjoy this movie as much as me, or you may hate it has much as some reviewers. But nothing is certain until you see it...i gave this movie 9/10 because nothing is perfect...",Death Becomes Her
186,v-bireaud,What good will it bring to you ?,3,20 January 2010,"I know it didn't bring anything good to me. As a Christian I especially look for morality in a movie, anywhere I can find it, as long as there is some I might just enjoy the movie.But where the heck is the morality in this movie ? probably in the fact that one woman just wants to have her man back and the other one wants to look ""Forever Young"". It felt rather light to me, just as Hollywood often does, put a bit of morals in it and mix it with a lot of useless action, basic character building, ambiguous events and there you have it. This one barely makes the exception, it has Bruce Willis, Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn as leads and that's pretty much the reason I watched it to begin with.But then comes the 'women's fight for man' except here one woman is just looking for 'immortality' (as many have put it) and that is basically the only part in which it differs from other movies. True this one was made in 1992 so it may deserve some of the credit but nonetheless it isn't gripping at all.I stopped watching after hearing the Lord's name being spoken three times in vain, how much do you have to go through before you say 'enough is enough' ?I do not recommend this movie, even though Bruce Willis does good acting it does not save the movie, at all. I advise you to look for something else.God bless you all.",Death Becomes Her
187,fara-flanders,Sensational Satire,10,18 June 2019,"Possibly Bruce Willis' and Meryl Streep's best movie (besides, The Devil Wears Prada, obviously) and the satire is so subtle it's easily overlooked.",Death Becomes Her
188,trekfan882004,This movie is great.,10,4 February 2004,I just love this movie! It has some of the greatest acting I have ever seen. For regular people they probability wont understand the complexity of this brillant movie. Meryl streep is a wonderfull actress. Bruce Willis's acting was so good I did not reconize him the first time I saw this move. Watch this movie if you like strange and wild stuff.,Death Becomes Her
189,lili-praat,enjoyable satiric movie,8,27 February 2012,"This is an excellent dark comedy! The main theme is about searching for immortality and never-ending youth. It's a current issue and the director handles it with a sense of humor. The main characters are comical, reliable and well considered.The performances of Bruce Willis, Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn are truly incorrigible! The movie won an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award and a Saturn award for visual effects.I must admit that the effects are ingenious for a movie made in 1992. My favorite part is the ending, when both ladies shatter into pieces. I believe that it refers to women of fifty, who obstinately believe they are still 20, using botox and other plastic surgery. 'Death becomes her' is well worth watching. I can recommend this film to everyone.",Death Becomes Her
190,suvswastegasoline,Zemeckis does dark SO well...,10,7 June 2004,"This was one of my favorite movies the first time I saw it. After seeing 'What Lies Beneath', I would have to say that, as much as I love Back to the Future, I like Zemeckis' darker films best. I absolutely loved Bruce Willis in this movie.Also, the use of film manipulation and special effects is excellent for its' time in this movie, and is still easily appreciated even now. What I love best about Zemeckis, has to be his use of the passing of time in his movies. Huge time lines are crammed into a few chapters! It's amazing. Characters age. It's so great. And, as always, there is just the right amount of imagination in this film. One of his best!",Death Becomes Her
191,JapeTheKid,hands down one of the best comedies I have ever seen,10,23 June 2006,"The genre of black comedy is today unfortunately lacking in many aspects . To think of black comedies there aren't really many to begin with. Not many worth watching, that is. Other forms of comedy have in recent years gone to the extremes in such a way that the real element of fun is missing in all the sex and secretions. There are of course important comedic factors to make the audiences laugh but in my opinion they have to come from the characters and the writing.In Death Becomes Her Robert Zemeckis brings in a cast extraordinaire to a film that is fresh in ideas and verging on poetic in its writing. The way the film is sculpted leaves only the most essential scenes on the screen, which at the end resonate with each other and become vital like peaces in a thrilling yet dark puzzle. If ever death truly became her, Zemeckis has found the right wardrobe yet. The cast bring their unpeccable goods despite all the visual effects (which still after 14 years look amazing). It must have been difficult to form characters in such an environment but there they are - flesh and not so warm blood. The actors are not TRYING to be funny, they are. Meryl Streep is on fire, never missing a beat as the distraught Madeline Ashton. Goldie Hawn matches her magic scene for scene, and gives a real performance of desperation. Bruce Willis stretches his comedic muscles like never before or after this. Isabella Rosselini is brilliantly cast as the sour and joie de vivre Lisle Von Rhoman. One feels almost ashamed when watching her.What is even still surprising in Death Becomes Her is that there are real motives behind all the actions. Hurting the one you love by using beauty and youth as a weapon, trying to stay young forever, finding happiness - these are big things, and there might have been a serious way to approach it. But then of course the essence of humor would be lost and I would be deprived of hands down one of the best comedies I have ever seen.",Death Becomes Her
192,stephdunn-39203,Ernest! Ernest! You pushed me down the stairssss,10,13 November 2018,"There aren't enough things I can say about this movie, So I won't say anything other than it is so good that when I started a movie sleeve tattoo I made a scene from this movie the primary focus. It's just so damn funny.",Death Becomes Her
193,stosjel,I haven't laughed this hard watching a film in years,9,14 March 2007,"I haven't laughed this hard watching a film in years! First of all the very theme is eternal life and how to get it.Sounds promising, doesn't it?Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn in conflict in which they forget the cause,and the conflict becomes it's own purpose.Until... Zemeckis gives us a film with,some might say,predictable plot.But isn't this a satire of the whole scheme? It's filled with smart little jokes and details.Every scene is very precisely built and planed.There was interesting use of longer shots with rich(er) mise-en-scene, and tension built by great editing. In her role Meryl Streep gave us so many wonderful,depicting and amusing little things that she does.Detailes,detailes!Goldie was also very funny,and Bruce was certainly unusual(but in a good way). This film could be used as great lesson in film directing.As a satire it touches a great number of Hollywood film clichés.But isn't learning how to film those clichés basis for making something unique? Anyway,great thanx to the creators of this film!",Death Becomes Her
194,martir-1,excellent acting but not very funny or memorable,3,13 February 2006,"""Death Becomes Her"" is a black comedy (movie that deals with an aspect of death and tries to make light of it). I was deeply disappointed with this movie, but then again, perhaps I just don't like black comedies? Bruce Willis, Goldie Hawn and Meryl Streep are 3 phenomenal actor/actresses. However, I found this movie was not very memorable to me. The theme was very repetitive and the action rather slow moving. The only other black comedy I have seen was ""Harold And Maude"" and at least that had an excellent sound track to go along with the movie.If you are into black humor, then perhaps you will enjoy this movie. If not, don't waste your time. I also felt that the constant portrayal of Lisel either in the nude or almost nude was put into the film for the sheer necessity of holding the viewers attention. It was a bit too much for my taste. Had the story lines been better, there would not have been a need for it. The movie itself would have carried you along.",Death Becomes Her
