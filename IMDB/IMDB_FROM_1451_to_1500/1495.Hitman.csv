0,Leofwine_draca,"A slick, soulless Hollywood action film",4,30 July 2016,"More generic twaddle hits the screen with this oh-so-passe console game adaptation that couldn't be more bland or derivative if it tried. Hit-man is a film mired in clichés from the very beginning, completely happy to be following predictable scenarios without ever delivering anything original in terms of style or content. Thus we get scenes in which our hero, hiding out in a hotel, is attacked by a SWAT team, scenes of snipers assassinating politicians, fights in train carriages, spy-type bits in railway stations, a big set-piece climax and not a great deal else.Timothy Olyphant is about the worst actor I could ever imagine playing a bald, expressionless hit-man. Even the other choice for the role, Vin Diesel, sounds good at this point, but Jason Statham would have been most effective, I think. Olyphant is supposed to be this tough cookie, a real bad ass, but he just feels like a mummy's boy instead. He's neither tough nor appealing to watch in the many action scenes, as worse a leading actor as you can get. He's supported by a decent Dougray Scott as a sympathetic Interpol agent hot on his tail, a goth-looking Olga Kurylenko as a sort-of love interest who goes naked (she was much better in QUANTUM OF SOLACE and looks unrecognisable here, complete with awful face tattoo), and Robert Knepper, a slimy Russian cop who stars in the most unintentionally funny scene (an off-kilter homage to the SAW films in which he's tortured with some kind of trap in a bathtub – it's hilarious, it really is).The action scenes are very poorly shot with silly martial arts stuff thrown in (the bit in which the assassins fight with knives is ludicrous). The suspense scenes scream Bourne, especially with the rip-off music playing all the while and the shaky-cam stuff thrown in for good measure. I was close to holding my head in my hands for this one, as it really is that bad. A disjointed mess and a slick, soulless Hollywood thriller to boot.",Hitman
1,SnoopyStyle,All posing No tension,5,31 October 2013,Assassin Agent 47 (Timothy Olyphant) has been trained from childhood along with other kids by The Organization. They are not aligned with any particular government but has connections with them all. The assassins have tattoo barcodes and shaved heads. Agent 47 is the best and pursued by Interpol Mike Whittier (Dougray Scott).The story is convoluted and unimportant. The style is less than most Hollywood big blockbusters. It's just at a lower level. The one word that comes to mind is Eurotrash. That's how I feel about this movie.Timothy Olyphant is not angry enough. He's suppose to be a cold hard killer. But he's just a cool guy playing an assassin. It shows. He's not mean enough. He doesn't project enough power or menace. It's all posing and no tension.,Hitman
2,kosmasp,Hits and misses,4,9 July 2008,"You don't have to be an avid gamer or fan of the game this movie is based on to get into the movie and/or story. If that's a good thing or not, that's up to the viewer to decide. On the hand, one can say a few thing about the actors/the cast: Timothy Olyphant does a decent job of portraying the title character. He's not superb, but convincing enough. Contrary to that, Mr. D. Scott does not add anything to the mix. Kind of face- and soul-less as the counter-point/-part to the Hit-man, he stays way behind and does not convey any sort of emotion. On the other hand the (new) Bond (for part 22) girl Olga K. is OK too. though you might want to watch her ""Paris je t'aime"" segment and/or ""The serpent"" as a pre-Bond reference.Onto the action that is pretty good and we have to thank the filmmakers for not going the PG-13 route some games-to-movies makers go! I did expect much more (story department, nemesis etc.), but it wasn't a complete disappointment either.",Hitman
3,jboothmillard,Hitman,4,21 May 2010,"When I heard this title, I knew instantly it was an adaptation of the popular video game, so like Resident Evil and Tomb Raider before it, I decided to give it a go. Basically, Agent 47 (Scream 2's Timothy Olyphant) is one of many genetically engineered agents, bald with bar code tattoos on the back of their necks, hired by a group known only as ""The Organisation"" and taught to use guns and martial arts. With a big political conspiracy going on, he is somehow set up for a hit, and is being pursued by both the Interpol and Russian military going across Eastern Europe. Along the way, Agent 47 is confronted by one of the men who wants him dead, Interpol agent Mike Whittier (Mission: Impossible II's Dougray Scott). He is joined by Russian beauty (originally a target for him, I think) Nika Boronina (Quantum of Solace's Olga Kurylenko). Also starring Heroes' Robert Knepper as Yuri Marklov, Ulrich Thomsen as Mikhail Belicoff, Michael Offei as Jenkins and Lost's Henry Ian Cusick as Udre Belicoff. I will be honest and say that I didn't really understand all of the story, but I did like a lot of the action and violent sequences, especially the 300 style splashing of blood (well, more liquid looking), and for that, it's not a terrible action thriller. Okay!",Hitman
4,ccthemovieman-1,The Poor Man's 'Bourne Identity',3,14 March 2008,"Most of what you read here in the user-comments is true: this is basically a check-your- brains-at-the-door flick, filled with mindless violence. However, it isn't all stupid. You do have use some brainpower to try follow this little ""conspiracy"" twist which is kind of a ripoff of the ""Bourne Identity"" stories where a hired hit-man is crossed up and both sides are looking for him. He also winds up, as ""Jason Bourne"" did, with an exotic-looking female getting involved with him and his deadly cat-and-mouse affair with government officials. Unlike the Bourne stories, this female was already involved with the situation. The character in here, too, is very sleazy with a ton of eye makeup that makes her even more cheap-looking.So, instead of Matt Damon and Franka Potente, we have Timothy Olyphant and Olga Kurylenko, neither of which has ever been in a hit movie. We also get a look at Russia and a little bit of Turkey as the supposed ""good guy"" (Agent 47) gets set up after he had completed his mission, which was to kill the Russian Premier. (The fact that the hero is a cold-blooded killer is a sad comment in itself.)The action scenes, I assume, are supposed to be the attraction to the viewers. It certainly isn't the dialog, which is so stupid it gets insulting after awhile. The first part of the film isn't bad but the second half is really rife with stupid lines, many said by the girl. It got so bad that with a half hour left in the film, I didn't care if saw the ending or not. By then, I had lost interest in any of the characters.By the way, I am reviewing this strictly as a movie. I know it's based on a video game, but not familiar with video games anymore. I only know this story here from what I see on film. It looked like a pleasant surprise after the first 15 minutes but goes downhill more and more as it goes on, making me totally agree with you other reviewers who commented on the low mentality of this script.",Hitman
5,rmax304823,Current Action Fads Passed Through a Duck Press.,2,24 February 2009,"Anyone planning to make an international thriller with an abundance of brutal action should definitely watch this, even if only as a time-saving device, because then he won't need to watch all the earlier movies this one copies from.The chief source, I believe, is ""The Bourne Identity."" I'll give an example. In ""The Bourne Identity,"" Matt Damon is an amnesic CIA assassin who takes his pick-up date to a truck stop restaurant. He explains to her that although he cannot remember his identity he cannot forget the knowledge and skills acquired during his previous experiences. To prove it, he tells the girl that he knows the license plates of every vehicle in the parking lot outside. The best place to look for a gun is in the glove compartment of the big truck. The waitress is left handed. The guy sitting at the bar weighs 250 pounds and knows how to take care of himself. He tells her all this without looking away from her face.The international hit man, Timothy Olyphant, in THIS movie pulls the same stunt but goes Matt Damon one better. The woman sitting two seats behind them may be wearing an orange dress but she is not a woman.The edgy score of ""The Bourne Identity"" was used to build suspense as Damon darted from place to place. Here it's omnipresent and is used during the action scenes as well, which, in the parent film, were filmed without music.The photography is in high contrast and tinted greenish blue. The hit man, who is being tracked by both Interpol (Dougray Scott) and the Russians (Robert Knepper as Yuri) and naturally doesn't want to be conspicuous, is a skinhead with a couple of weird tattoos on the rear end of his skull.The action scenes are incredibly brutal without being in the least realistic. They shed verisimilitude without a shiver. There's blood all over the place. Olyphant's hit man can take out a dozen mean guys with guns, swords, fists, grenades, arquebuses, blunderbuses, trebuchets, maces, water pistols, paint balls, cream pies, halberds and pikes. And when he's done, he's not even breathing fast. And the scenes of bloodshed are abundant. They punctuate the story the way sexual engagements appear in skin flicks, with the plot serving as not much more than the thin, logical thread to hold the juicier parts together.The director has evidently told Olyphant to hold his naked head downward so he can look up from under his eyebrows and appear to be glowering. He glowers all the time. He glowers when he shoots disarmed and helpless enemies or professional targets. He glowers when he's in bed with his Russian girl friend, Olga Kurylenko. I think I saw him glowering in his sleep. It's just as well that he sleeps because although he certainly looks mean he cannot voice a believable line.That's not true for most of the rest of the cast. Knepper, Scott, and Kurylenko don't have much to do or say but they inform their roles with some conviction. If the roles are a little dumb it's not the performers' fault. I mean, look at Olga Kurylenko. She's just an ordinary streetwalker who is accidentally swept up in Olyphant's mercenary activities. When he wants to get rid of her he's going to shoot her, just as he shoots everyone else who is an encumbrance. His hand is already on the silenced automatic. She barely manages to talk him out of shooting her, yet she hangs on and zips around with this guy, going to fancy restaurants, prancing around in the nude, trying to seduce him (he injects her with some knockout serum to get her to stop). Any woman with brains or a decent script, in such a position, would get the hell away from the maniac pronto.I didn't watch the end. Maybe you'll be able to. But I'm getting pretty sick of these mindless and endless movies that incorporate the latest generic fads. ""The Bourne Identity"" was a fairly good genre film. Its spawn have not been.",Hitman
6,paul_haakonsen,Actually quite good...,7,31 October 2019,"This 2007 movie based on the Eidos hit game franchise ""Hitman"" wasn't actually as bad as one would initially think it would be. I mean, a movie based on a game usually doesn't have a good hand of cards dealt. But still, this is Agent 47, so of course the movie had to be watched.And now in 2019 is actually the second time I watch this movie from writer Skip Woods and director Xavier Gens. Turns out that the movie actually is far more entertaining than what you'd assume for a movie based on a game.The storyline is straight forward, easily followed, and actually provides enough value to keep you entertained from start to end. Sure, this movie is not one that will challenge you intellectually, not by a long shot, but just sit back and enjoy the action ride.Timothy Olyphant actually managed to portray a convincing Agent 47 in this movie, and he does carry the movie quite nicely. I think it was a shame that Robert Knepper didn't have a bigger role in the movie, because he was shining when he was on the screen, and he could have been put to so much better use with given more screen time.There is a lot of action in the movie - well, it dwarves in comparison to the sheer amount of action in the 2015 movie ""Hitman: Agent 47"" - but still, it is quite enjoyable and more than enough to keep you entertained. And the actors and actresses perform quite well and deliver some convincing scenes, both in acting scenes and action scenes.Even if you are not familiar with the game franchise, then ""Hitman"" is a movie that you can just as easily sit down, watch and enjoy.The scene where Agent 47 crash through a hotel window and come upon two young lads playing Hitman in the room on console, nah... That was just way too tacky, and it was such an unnecessary thing to have in the movie, because it made zero sense and it just dumbed down the entire movie.""Hitman"" from 2007 is definitely an action movie that is well-worth taking the time to sit down and watch. My rating is a solid seven out of ten stars.",Hitman
7,michaelRokeefe,Thoroughly riveting. An assassin with a number.,8,17 March 2008,"A mega selling video game comes to life on the silver screen with a high body count and enough action to have you hanging on the edge of your seat. You just won't want to miss a second of this thriller. A genetically-engineered assassin known only as Agent 47(Timothy Olyphant), works for a top secret organization and his talents as an elite marksman is for hire to eliminate high profile targets. His grace is lethal and his precision is beyond remarkable. His target is Russian President Belicoff(Urich Thomsen), who will prove to be a double assignment. When 47 is double-crossed on the mission, he becomes the hunted...by Interpol and the best of the Russian military. He also has to deal with unfamiliar emotions, when a beautiful and mysterious Russian woman(Olga Kurylenko)supplies him information about Belicoff. Sauve and deadly 47 deals violent retribution and reigns supreme in life-or-death games. This movie definitely provides the big bang for your buck. Very scenic locations and beautiful photography. Also in the cast: Dougray Scott, Robert Knepper, Michael Offei and James Faulkner.",Hitman
8,Theo Robertson,The Film That Teaches The World All About Jurisdiction,5,30 November 2012,"This is a movie based on a video game and was produced by the efant terrible of recent French cinema Luc Besson . These are good marketing points that will appeal to fans of noisy shallow cinema with lots of explosions , gun fire and naked women . It also holds the distinction of being the film with the most gratuitous use of the word "" Jurisdiction "" . In fact if you've no idea what jurisdiction means you'll find this the most mind bending and complicated film ever madeInterpol agent Mike Wittier is hot on the trail of enigmatic international hit-man Agent 47 . Wittier loves his job and upon arriving in Russia informs the authorities "" That I have full jurisdiction in this case "" . This doesn't go down well with the local police because their head of law enforcement later tells Wittier that ""You have no jurisdiction here "" only for Wittier to reply . "" Under Eu law I every right of jurisdiction "" . Feeling a bit left out that he's a policeman - and not a very good one - Wittier's sidekick needs to get on in the act with "" You mean we have no jurisdiction here ? "" . Meanwhile Agent 47 kills lots of people with guns and has lots of sex with some cute brunette prostitute without needing to say "" jurisdiction "" in any context So next time you're having a bad day and someone orders you to do something you don't want to do just look them in the eye and ask "" Is that really in my jurisdiction ? "" and see if they get the reference . You too can for a tiny moment in time look like Dougray Scott",Hitman
9,Scarecrow-88,Hit-man,7,4 July 2009,"A contract killer(..a bald Timothy Olyphant, in custom suits and tie, sporting a bar code on the back of his head), brought up and trained from childhood by a shadowy organization, is set up by a Russian political figure(Ulrich Thomsen) and will do whatever it takes to get even. In tow is the target's often abused ""property"", a young woman(..the smoldering Ukrainian beauty, Olga Kurylenko) he purchased and now wishes executed for she ""knows too much"". Both will move through Russia(..Moscow mostly), dodging a determined Interpol Agent(Dougray Scott) and the country's own police force in order for the hit-man's mission to be accomplished.Slick looking ultra-violent action flick which operates along the lines of the Bourne series featuring an unstoppable, highly skilled assassin who remains one step ahead of those pursuing him. He's the puppeteer while those after him are merely his puppets on string, his maneuvering them in any way he wishes. Robert Knepper is Yuri Marklov, working for the corrupt Russian politician who must answer for his men's incapability at eliminating the the thorn in their side. When I entered viewing this film I was expecting a tame dud because the version I thought I was watching seemed to be rated PG-13..then I started watching it and realized this must've been the intentional version the first director, Xavior Gens, had envisioned. The film features lots of shootouts(..plenty of blood spray) and Agent 47(Olyphant doesn't have a name)often engages fellow assassins in thrilling hand-to-hand combats. While the film never allows 47 and his ""luggage"" to carry their budding relationship to the expected climax, the film certainly opens the possibility that these two will become an item. The film is ultimately about a man and his mission, an incredibly gifted, well trained marksman who never abandons his assignment..even if the assignment is made by the very same person who is himself the victim! Olyphant, one of those actors who hadn't quite reached the top tier in starring as an action hero, accepting the role after Vin Diesel passed, barely changes expression(..and rarely talks) keeping his mind, almost, always on the task at hand. Kurylenko has these wonderful moments where she's allowed to bilk her enormous sex appeal, walking through a hotel room practically naked(..except for a little pair of panties)as Agent 47, even as his mind is preparing for the next objective in his strategy to kill his quarry, stares at her as she overlooks the city from a balcony. Scott is, of course, solid as the Hit-man's dogged pursuer, who has tracked him for a long period of time and seems to know him better than anyone, although he encounters countless resistance along the way.The action sequences(..how Agent 47 is able to infiltrate areas swarming with authorities and heavily armed henchman)are flashy and highly stylized(..if preposterous and improbable)..I'm guessing fans of the game, for which this based, won't be disappointed.",Hitman
10,LeonLouisRicci,Delivers High-Def Blood Splatter with Ultra-Violence and Style,7,20 January 2016,"Based on a Video Game, but that Hardly Matters to Anyone but a Myopic, Pimply-Faced, Shut-In.

11,poolandrews,Empty action film video game adaptation.,4,9 May 2010,"Hit-man starts in St. Petersberg in Russia where top assassin Agent 47 (Timothy Olyphant) assassinates the Russian President Mikhail Belicoff (Ulrich Thomsen), Agent 47's superiors are happy with his work but Agent 47 is then surprised to President Belicoff hold a press conference on TV with nothing more than a plaster on his head. Agent 47 never misses & know's he killed his target so how is President Belicoff still alive? Agent 47 is set-up to kill a young woman named Nika Boronina (Olga Kurylenko) which turns out to be a double cross as another assassin tries to kill Agent 47, Agent 47 realises the whole thing has been an elaborate set-up to kill the real President so an impostor can take his place & he is supposed to take the fall for it. Agent 47 also know's that while he is still alive they will never stop looking for him & trying to kill him...This French American co-production was directed by Xavier Dens & is a live action film adaptation of the Eidos computer game Hit-man: Codename 47 that was released back in 2000, I will admit that I have never played the Hit-man game & in fact until I read that it was based on a game during the opening credits of the film I didn't even know it was. As an action thriller Hit-man isn't too bad I suppose but it's hardly amazing, the plot is all over the place with scenes seemingly edited in at random & a story that doesn't make much sense if you think about it. I mean why hire Agent 47 to kill someone & then have someone else try to kill him? Would they then get someone else to kill the guy that killed Agent 47? Where does it stop? What was the point? There's no reasonable explanation as to why the prostitute Nike becomes involved in the action apart from the fact Agent 47 asked her a few questions & there's never any reason given as to why these superhuman assassins have a bar-code tattooed on the back of their bald heads, again I mean aren't they supposed to blend in & be undetectable? Why doesn't the Russian lot & interpol just put an APB on a 'tall bald guy with a bar-code tattooed on the back of his head', there can't be too many guy's who fit that description, can there? I know the bar-code is part of the game but it just doesn't work here at all. The character's are really bad here, Agent 47 in particular just mopes around the film with zero charisma killing anyone he wants in a very cold & emotionless fashion & I found it impossible to like or to warm to him or the character. Nika is your standard love interest while there's yet another ridiculous complicated plot going on that really serves no purpose, all the twists are silly as it seems these people can see into the future & predict things & events perfectly & even the action set-pieces are forgettable.All the background of the character is dropped apart from an opening scene edited from footage from Dark Angel (2000), apparently according to the game Agent 47 is meant to be the perfect genetically engineered assassin but there's no mention of this (beyond the original trailer which has more depth than the final film itself) with the film hinting that he's a trained orphan but he just comes across as some superhuman as he dodges bullets, never misses a shot & can outrun explosions. I never felt he was in danger at all & Agent 47 never even gets so much as a scratch on him, there's just no venerability there & no human side at all which makes it impossible care or sympathise. The action is slick & there's none of the quick edited crap but it's rather bland & forgettable, mostly just shoot-outs really there's a also a sword fight & a couple of explosions. Available in 'R' rated & 'Unrated' versions the differences are purely for violence & there's no extra story or character depth, still the extra blood & gore including a chopped off arm is appreciated & there's some boobs here as well. Director Xavier Gans was fired while editing Hit-man & was replaced, not only was the film reedited but there were re-shoots as well.With a supposed budget of about $24,000,000 this has a slick look & is often quite stylish but just stops short of being really cool, sure there's the expected poses & gun-play but much of it forgettable. Filmed largely in Sofia in Bulgaria. The game the kids are playing in the hotel room is Hit-man: Blood Money from 2006. The acting isn't great, Olyphant is just to cold & looks bored more than anything while Dougary Scott is the only one who injects any life to their part.Hit-man is an OK action thriller, I don't think it's that good to be fair although it does move along at a decent pace & there's some pleasantly violent moments but the plot is weak & the main character is so detached & unlikable it's hard to care. As far as video game adaptations go Hit-man isn't the worst but neither is it the best. A sequel Hit-man 2 (2011) is currently in development.",Hitman
12,CinemaSerf,Raising a spectre of a different kind...,6,12 October 2021,"Someone, somewhere ought to have looked at the whole concept of this film and enquired - why? Sure, the production standards are high enough - money was clearly spent here somewhere - but aside from on the visuals, it must have gone on the lunches. Timothy Olyphant - bald, or otherwise, has all the menace of a wet lettuce and here that slight detail just about nullifies all of the rest of the really pedestrian storyline. He is the ruthless, genetically modified, agent ""47"" hired by a clandestine organisation to carry out a hit - all whilst being pursued by the world and it's wife across some, admittedly, gorgeous locations. The dialogue is banal, the jeopardy non-existent and the whole thing just lurches along with the sort of set piece inevitability that loudly proclaims ""straight to video"".

13,dbborroughs,"Great action scenes are joined by a cliché filled plot and a lack of intensity in direction. Worth trying, but I'd wait for cable",5,28 December 2007,"Movie based on a video game series. Here Agent 47, a hit man for a secret organization finds that a change in a hit has left him a target. Wanting to know why, and how his target is still alive he begins to search for answers while Interpol and the Russian police pursue him.The action sequences are good but the rest of the film never really works. there is a lack of intensity and almost no suspense as 47 chases after his answers and is chased himself.It doesn't help that the plot is pure cliché from top to bottom and other then the Russian setting you've seen this all before. It also doesn't help that there is a lack of caring in the direction that makes what we are watching outside of the action scenes bland.Its a disappointing film.

14,lastliberal,Yell all you like - the Lord himself won't hear you.,6,12 October 2008,"So, this is an adaptation from a video game. Maybe that is part of the problem. It just didn't have any soul. It was cold and mindless and exciting, but the sets looked as if they came from a video game, and there was more shooting than performing.Compare that to Jason Statham in Crank or Clive Owen in Shoot 'Em Up; both had lots of action, but they also had characters we cared about and something of a story to follow. They had a soul.Timothy Olyphant was pleasurable, but didn't have much to work with. Ukrainian Olga Kurylenko (Paris, je t'aime) was an interesting character, not just for her casual dress, but she was someone you cared about. There should have been more like her. We'll get to see more of her in Quantum of Solace, and I look forward to that.The formula for the movie is entertaining, but more needed to be done.",Hitman
15,zardoz-13,"""Hitman"" Misses The Mark Completely!",3,6 December 2007,"You'd think Twentieth Century Fox would have shot the works on their cinematic adaptation of the popular video game ""Hitman."" Instead, these corporate clowns have succeeded only in shooting themselves in their feet with a flat, formulaic, standard-issue thriller that has neither a shred of suspense nor a sense of style. Initially, ""xXx"" star Vin Diesel had planned to star in this preposterous pabulum. In a last-minute casting shuffle, however, baby-faced Timothy Olyphant replaced the burly, blunt Diesel. Olyphant managed to menace Bruce Willis in ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" but he isn't as intimidating as Diesel. Basically, with his Lex Luther look, i.e., Olyphant is as bald as Diesel, but he is rarely as bold as Diesel. Olyphant shares the blame for ""Hitman"" with the fools who wrote and helmed what should have gone directly to video along with all the other cloned claptrap. ""Swordfish"" scribe Skip Woods contributes a slipshod screenplay that qualifies as a catalogue of clichés. The outlandish Clive Owen actioneer ""Shoot'em Up,"" about a deadly accurate hit-man protecting a woman and an orphan infant that illuminated screens a few months ago, emerges as a masterpiece compared to this cretinous, incomprehensible, comic book nonsense. Sophomore French director Xavier Gens doesn't provide enough larger-than-life set-pieces or eye-opening stunts to enliven things. Worse, the origins of our elite, enigmatic title character called Agent 47 are shrouded in secrecy, and Agent 47 is so invincible you know he will never acquire so much as a scratch, even in a room swarming with flying lead. The only thing remotely surprising is that our anti-heroic hero finds the time to keep his head clean-shaved so the bar code tattooed to the back of his noggin stands out for all to see.""Hitman"" opens one dark rainy morning in London, England, as Interpol agent Mike Whittier (Dougray Scott of ""Mission Impossible III"") arrives home from a late night at the office to find his electricity isn't working. In the dark, he stumbles over a corpse and is surprised by the fugitive that he has been pursuing around the world for the last three years. Cool as crushed ice, Agent 47 (Timothy Olyphant of ""Scream 2"") has been patiently awaiting Whittier's arrival. They have an off-the-record chat that dissolves into a flashback. This flashback occurs three months in the past when Agent 47 had been assigned to assassinate Russian President Mikhail Belicoff (Ulrich Thomsen of ""The World Is Not Enough"") and learned the client wanted the hit to take place in public. Flashbacks invariably mar films, and this flashback is no exception. Until the last quarter hour of the film, when the action reverts back to Whittier's home, neither Whittier nor Agent 47 can either die or suffer grievous bodily harm. Ultimately, ""Hitman"" qualifies as anti-climactic because we know nothing can happen to either of them. As a result, the movie springs few surprises on us.Along the way, we learn a little about our taciturn protagonist's background. During the opening title credits, with classical composer Franz Schubert's ""Ava Maria"" playing on the soundtrack, we are shown bald-headed, little boys as an adult tattoos bar codes onto the backs of their heads. Anyway, these kids are taught discipline and shown how to wield firearms with lethal accuracy. Sentries with telescopic rifles surround the place and pick the kids that try to escape off like flies as they climb the surrounding fence. Eventually, an individual decked out like a Catholic priest with a white collar gives the hero a polished box with two automatic pistols.Once on the outside, Agent 47 receives messages via a computer notebook and rarely disobeys his orders. At one point, he reveals to another character that he works for an outfit known only as 'The Agency' that has been training, equipping, and dispatching assassins to perform executions for decades. These agents operate alone, and their trademark is their clean-shaved heads. Neither Woods nor Gens explain why these hit men must shun cranial hair in the performance of their duties. Curiously, despite his top ranking as an assassin, Agent 47 appears ill at ease around women. He excuses himself nervously when a female tries to pick him up at the bar. Later, in the confines of his own motel room, a sultry young woman tries to entice Agent 47 with the promise of sex. The woman gets nowhere because Agent 47 zaps her with something that puts her to sleep. Indeed, in this sexually promiscuous era, Agent 47 emerges as an ironic role model for sexual abstinence. Actually, this turns out to be the most interesting thing about him. He can shoot bullets, but he cannot shoot sperm! Essentially, Agent 47 concerns himself only with killing his targets and has little use for people as social acquaintances.After Agent 47 shoots President Belicoff, he learns to his shock that the high-ranking official has survived his bullet. Our incredulous protagonist starts snooping around for any worthwhile clues. Inevitably, he finds out that Belicoff's girlfriend, Nika Boronina (erotic Olga Kurylenko of ""The Serpent""), is on the lam because she knows about Belicoff's use of doubles to confuse assassins. Agent 47 saves Nika before the bad guys get to her, and they become a twosome. The Russia Federal Police have launched a manhunt for both Agent 47 and Nika, and Interpol shows up to help the Russians. Meanwhile, Agent 47 and Nika find themselves dodging assassins from 47's own organization. Although Gens displays minimal expertise in orchestrating blood splattered firefights in close quarters with automatic weapons, he cannot tell a coherent story. Unless you know something about the 2001 video game, you won't initially understand the presence of the CIA in this lame action thriller. Sadly, too, the villains are always one step behind the hero who rarely seems to have problems with dispatching them. They annoy him more often than antagonize him.""Hitman"" is a hit-and-miss shoot'em up saga that misses more often than it hits bull's-eye.",Hitman
16,Boba_Fett1138,Could had been way better with a more experienced director.,6,21 July 2008,"""Hitman"" is basically a well made and good looking movie but with one big flaw to it. The story just never really flows well. The movie feels inconsistent, with basically just the one action sequence after the other, which really makes you loose interested into the actual story of the movie. Because of this, the story of ""Hitman"" just doesn't work out. The story instead now mostly remains confusing and not everything seems really connected enough. I'm not saying Xavier Gens is a bad director, or ""Hitman"" is a bad movie but you can just tell by looking at this that with a more experienced director at the helm, who had the abilities to the make the story flow well, this could had really been a superior modern action-flick.The movie now instead is perhaps style over substance. Especially its action sequences are well directed and great looking, making this simply a fine action-flick to watch. The movie gets really carried by those sequences and are what is making ""Hitman"" still a seriously fine and enjoyable flick to watch. You don't have to be a fan of the video games to enjoy this movie.Because the story doesn't really work out, the character of agent 47 also doesn't really. They try to give him a more humane face and he wants to start a normal life on his own. The movie builds up and hints to this constantly but in the end it doesn't wrap it up properly, which makes it look like as if all those moments within the movie are pointless and don't serve a significant enough purpose for the main character. Same goes for the love interest played by former model Olga Kurylenko. In the long run you're only wondering; 'Now what was exactly the purpose of this character in the movie?'.Perhaps it's also Timothy Olyphant fault, who plays the movie its main character. At times he's acting too much, rather than being agent 47 enough. Agent 47 is cool and to the point, who never looses his focus on things. In this movie he's constantly struggling with himself and the world and by default he also has way too many lines, in my personal opinion. I think that the character would had worked out way better if he had been an almost complete mute. It would had made the character cooler and more mysterious and would had given the other actors, mainly Olga Kurylenko and Dougray Scott, to do their thing and become the more 'human' face of the movie.For Olga Kurylenko is especially a real discovery. She had starred in movies before but mostly in small unknown small French flicks. But main thing is that she can really act and she of course also has the looks, which helps her a lot. Because of those two reasons she also got cast as Bond-girl in the new Bond movie ""Quantum of Solace"", which will be released later this year.All in all, ""Hitman"" is a movie, with superior action sequences, that I enjoyed watching but its story and main approach of things prevent this from being an absolute genre must-see.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Hitman
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Sneaks onto the movie scene, misses the mark somewhat, and may die as fast as a target in one of the games",5,30 November 2007,"There are going to be two distinct groups that this will/may appeal to; the fans of the video-game, and your average action fan(or fans of average action). I fit into both. However, the problem is that those in the first group may very well find this as ultimately unsatisfying as I did(which is not to say I was not entertained, or regret my viewing, on the opening night, here in Denmark), and that those in the second, honestly, could do an awful lot better. I've heard this described as Bourne light, and those who are familiar with both characters, even superficially, will know how wrong that is. As far as the action fans go, the action just doesn't work as well as other efforts(though there are some fairly cool moments in there), and not that much of it is particularly memorable, though most of it seems to try, and want, to be. It's shot fine, though there is occasional confusion, and in at least one sequence, it was downright difficult to tell what was happening. The physical fights are somewhat ineffective, with so-so choreography and *very* obviously overdone sounds(I would guess they were trying to make it ""bigger"", which makes sense to do, but the execution, pardon the pun, needed *serious* work). One thing, that really hits any viewer of this film, is just how little coverage there is of the background. The trailer describes what may be the intended background for the film... but if you haven't seen that, you might not know much of it, because hardly any of it is present in the film. Guys, a hint; if you're going on ""people know it from the video game"", you sorta have to actually use the *same* background. Apart from the bar-code, the baldness and the... (wait, that's actually it), the background really isn't that of the games. That is acceptable(if it does rob the character of his most interesting qualities), my complaint goes to the lack of detail and explanation in the film. There's a difference between mystery and simply not sharing information. Now, to those who are fans of the games, some of which may very well have desired a movie for close to a decade(be careful what you wish for). On the plus side, they did get some stuff right. They did not ruin the look by trying to give 47 hair, and the bar-coded baldy actually somehow fits in the film's universe, not seeming out of place. He wears his trademark suit. He does seem to prefer his good old Silverballers, and the ever-recognizable symbol that's been with the games from the beginning(which, together with the suit, may be one of the things to change the least, through the four games). There're a reasonable number of nods to the games, and those of us who've been fans for years will recognize many things. Unfortunately, there is also bad... perhaps the biggest issue being Nika. From the first time I watched the trailer, I knew about her being in the film, and I had the feeling right away that it was... not good. Her inclusion makes this even *more* Bourne light, and, frankly, she doesn't do a thing in the entire film. She was added to give the young males something to look at, and to an extent, add emotion to forty-seven(but really more the first). I would have had no problem if she had been added for a meaningful purpose, but when she spends most of her time setting up the title character's ""I'm such a bad-ass""(which he is, but we don't need it shoved down our throats) lines, and/or walking around with little to no clothing on... it just doesn't belong here. It could be argued that they took the name, the popular title, and turned it into mindless action. The character's personality... he talks too much, even to the point of having one-liners. I would have liked more facial expression and body language. His awkwardness towards women is straight out of the games, but it did not work anywhere near as well as it did there, and it's not used well, if at all, here. The casting of Olyphant has both good and bad to it. He fits, more or less, the physical(I am not kidding you, I might not have watched this at all, had Diesel actually starred... my dislike of him notwithstanding, he is *not* 47! He's a big muscular guy) type, and his eyes and some mannerisms/movements do fit, somewhat. But I don't know if Tim has the range, or if he understands the character. Hit-man is perfectly capable of talking, but he only really does it when it's necessary. The film didn't have enough of the subtlety(though it did have some, and it was pretty good) found in the games, focusing far more on him killing groups of people, guns blazing, which, while possible in the games, is something that is a lot less beneficial and encouraged, throughout them. The pacing seems in a hurry, hence the lack of these sequences. There is some build-up, however, and I would say that at least one thing does pay off... however, almost all of it, well, just doesn't. The plot is rather messy and self-contradictory, considering how simple it is. The acting is decent. Ulrich Thomsen has done better. Scott has or uses an accent that, to me, was quite distracting. Robert Knepper isn't too bad. Cusick, whom I do like, doesn't look, sound, or in any other way, really fit the character he plays, not even the nationality. The dialog is not really memorable, and seldom very good. The tone can be crude, unnecessarily. One could have hoped for a more sophisticated, stylish(when this attempts to be that, which fortunately is not often, it fails) approach, more in line with the games. All in all, don't expect the greatness of the games, but you could do worse. I recommend this to fans of action-flicks(not really fans of the games). 5/10",Hitman
18,neil-476,So-so actioner,5,9 May 2010,"I didn't even know there was a video game on which this movie was based until I looked on the IMDb, so I'm looking at this simply as a movie.It's OK, but no better than OK.There's lots of dull secret agenting and assassinating which takes place in Russia and Istanbul, featuring a bald assassin (Timothy Olyphant) with a barcode on the back of his head, who is being chased by various factions which wish to kill him. I wondered why he didn't get a hat in order to make his head slightly less conspicuous, but perhaps his scalp was allergic to fabric. Accompanying him is a young woman (Olga Kurylenko) and the simplest thing he could do is kill her with the same lack of passion he displays when he kills lots and lots of other people (He is an assassin after all). Yet he doesn't. Nor does he leap athwart her, despite her plentiful unclothed invitations to do so.Olyphant is nicely intense, some of the action is well staged, and Kurylenko is very fetching as she saunters around wearing not very much (she also delivers by far the best performance in the film).But the rest of the action is stupid (the usual business whereby the protagonist's every bullet hits its target while everybody else unloads lorryloads of ordnance and hits sod-all), the story is uninvolving and needlessly involved, the supporting cast is less than wonderful, and the thing as a whole fails to engage.",Hitman
19,zetes,Convoluted and boring,3,30 March 2008,"Another video game adaptation, and the results are pretty much what you would expect. Well, that the results are bad, you might expect. The story isn't very video game-ish. I haven't played this particular game myself, but the story here seems more influenced by the Bourne movies. And it's vastly inferior, and certainly doesn't need to exist. Timothy Olyphant plays a hit-man, known only as Agent 47. 47 and his ilk, created in an African camp whose purpose it is to build super-hit men, are the most conspicuous hit men in the history of cinema. Not only are they mostly young, bald white guys who would be easy to see and identify, they have barcodes on the back of their heads that could be scanned from a grocery store on the moon. 47 is on a mission in St. Petersberg to assassinate the incumbent president. As if you couldn't guess, he is being set up. Much of the movie consists of lengthy exposition, but, for the life of me, I was never quite sure I knew what was going on. The action sequences aren't terrible, but they are the kind that are so edited that you can only half tell what's happening. The only real reason to watch it might be if you were a Lost fan, as I am, and want to see Henry Ian Cusick play an arms dealing pimp who at one point gets to wield two machine guns at once trying to kill the protagonist. Well, the girl, Olga Kurylenko, is quite attractive, too. She's one of the next Bond girls in The Quantum of Solace. Otherwise, it's an incomprehensible mess.",Hitman
20,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Hit-man,4,28 November 2007,"10 years ago, Philip Noyce directed a movie that was based on an adapted character. He put this character in Russia, and got him embroiled in some political intrigue that's way over his head and should not have involved him in the first place. Naturally, our anti-hero (he's a professional thief by the way) bites back, using skills he honed to perfection, and basically relying on his smarts to escape near misses. His charisma ensured he had a beauty with brains tagging along, albeit reluctantly but given no choice with her involvement in the scheme of things, before forging trust, and possible romance.His name? Simon Templar, aka The Saint.Today, we have Xavier Gens taking a character, Agent 47 (Timothy Olyphant) based on an EDIOS game called The Hit-man, and scribe Skip Woods' story has this best of the best (they always have to be) in St Petersburg to do what he does, and that's to carry out professional hit jobs at the direction of The Agency (are you quivering now?). He gets embroiled in a political conspiracy given his mark is a certain political figure, and has the Russian military, his own organization and Interpol (led by Dougray Scott's Mike Whittier) after his hide. Along the way, he saves Nika Boronina (Olga Kurylenko) a Russian call girl / sex slave from certain death, and in between finds himself in a very difficult romance.Notice the similarities? It's The Saint all over again, except this time, Agent 47 resembles more of Jason Bourne, but without the hair, replaced by shiny baldness with a cartoony barcode tattooed at the back. He has a penchant for suits and trenchcoats, but only to hide his mean knives when he chooses to engage in more dignified battles. So unlike the suave Simon Templar, he opts for the obvious, and should have taken a leaf or two in styling and disguises from Templar, rather than walking around being the odd one out of a sea of hairy heads and a barcode that says ""Hello World"".Anyway that's the character design from the game, so we can't complain about it can we, just as how Angelina Jolie had to have her ample assets enhanced to match Lara Croft's. But its similarity to Jason Bourne cannot be denied, in the way that both are professional assassins, and probably schooled in the same close quartered unarmed combat techniques, and the similarity even went down to how these action sequences were shot and edited - quick cuts, jerky hand held style.It's action set pieces turned out to be rather ordinary, probably because they are rehashes of some classical scenes that we've seen before in other movies. Like the shoot em up with machine guns, the shattering of pillars and plenty of blow em ups with a rock soundtrack blaring in the background that we've seen in the Matrix movies. Or how about ""paying homage"" to Hong Kong movies like Johnny To's Mexican standoffs in recent flicks like Mad Detective and Exiled, but done with less pizazz and the proceedings and outcome bordering on the ridiculous. Or how about close quartered fisticuffs done while crouching under a platform, ala Jet Li's Fong Sai-Yuk? And how about a Saw's Jigsaw inspired moment to boot?But truly the scene which took the cake, was one done in extremely bad taste. In referencing the tragic terrorist event in Russia where government forces used gas to literally put friend and foe to sleep before they stormed a theatre, this gets repeated here with cruel aplomb, and I thought it was quite insensitive of the filmmakers to do so, in the manner in which they did so.If you can put aside all these misgivings, then you'll probably find something remotely to enjoy with Hit-man. Agent 47 is bald Bourne, but he's not amnesiac, and having been brought up in an all male monastery, it wrecks havoc on his non-existent sex life, especially when Nika hits on him time and again, sans clothes. There are many sub plots and unnecessary scenes in this movie, but they remained so that this wouldn't turn out to be a short film, or feel part of the video game where you have absolutely no control over. Timothy Olyphant did a rather decent job as Agent 47 as the role calls for little emotion (i.e. nothing to do except alternating between cool and mean) with stuntmen making him look good. In fact, most characters were pretty one-dimensional, and Nika the call girl would have been every fan/geek boy's wet dream come true. If I should praise anything, then it should be the way villains are dispatched without the bullshit lapsing into monologues.Video game movies rarely are hits, and while Agent 47 never misses a target, I would classify this one under a huge misfire. The story's ho-hum, the action very familiar and mediocre with a lacklustre effort all around. And I'm sure to walk out next time if the male lead tells the hot chick ""don't worry about finding me, I'll find you, no matter where in the world you can be"". Yeah right.",Hitman

For a video game movie the execution of it all is done alright, not anything amazing but decent. Timothy Olyphant does a great job of portraying Agent 47 who is a deadly assassin, the movie doesn't have a lot of elements from the video game but as a whole it's a good video game movie. And for the most part stays true to the franchise, except with more explosions instead of silent kills and without the use of clones. Another highlight of this flick is Olga Kurylenko she is hot in this, I never knew about this actress until this movie but it's good that this movie boosted her career.

25,thesar-2,Hitting Rock Bottom,1,10 February 2010,"Ahhh..that's so cute. Hit-man wants to be Bourne Again.And even down to its music.If this isn't classic Hollywood. A huge successful movie (or franchise) usually precedes knockoffs. Probably the most famous, and over used, was either Halloween (1978) or The Matrix (1999.) Both movies (and series) spawned absolutely numerous rip-offs. Only a few can pull it off, namely because they actually develop somewhat of a script in advance. Unfortunately, Hit-man, based on some series of video games (of which, I admit to not playing, yet,) failed at every single aspect. Including being the next Bourne movie. And, just for fun, let's list the awards it should be winning in the category of failures:Worst acting. Worst dialogue. Worst attempt at snappy lines. Most overuse of slo-mo. Worst adaptation of a video game. Most inept, incoherent and confusing script of all time. Worst adaption of any source. Most uninteresting characters. Best reason for a good actor (Olyphant) to reconsider simply skimming over a script before agreeing to star. Hero or Anti-Hero you're least likely to root for. Most predictable storyline. Funniest serious movie you'll see. Least likely to promote repeat viewings. Most obvious hit man in the history of hit men. Least interesting and Worst choreographed fight scenes – two for one! Most ironic name given to the writer (Skip.) There is no justice on how this didn't sweep the Razzies, with that many, and probably more, awards.Admittedly, I was confused throughout this boreathon, but what I got from the dumb plot is: a man programmed from birth, baldy #47 (Olyphant) is a, well, I hate to spoil this, but a hit man! And he's assigned the assassination of the Russian President. Things don't go well and predictably, he's set up by the same people who wanted him to carry out this mission. Man, that pains me to write that, because this plot line has been used so many times that simply renting Hit-man should tell you that at some point he'll be double-crossed. Duh.Well, he meets this girl (another wildly unoriginal and foreseen event) and maybe, MAYBE, he'll lighten up. Not really, but at that point the movie's so incredibly bad and laughable, you'll accept the 95% great Olyphant's apology (if he would ever.) Perhaps this is my fault. Recently, I've yearned for new action flicks and always end up with comedies. Maybe I should choose one of those horrible Rom-Coms in search for an action movie. Hollywood's just become lazy, and here's the proof. Even the actors in the movie look uninterested. Like I said, if the writer's name (SKIP) doesn't give away what should've happened in the first place, you should take that same advice and SKIP this movie. Afterall, it has ZERO attributes.",Hitman
26,Robert_duder,Hit-man is definitely heading in the right direction,7,18 March 2008,"It's a dangerous area to tread into...the world of video game to movie. It's been done really well (Resident Evil Series) and it's been done terribly (DOOM, House of the Dead etc.) Hit-man I think is perhaps one of the most potential licenses for films because there really is an incredible story there and yes I am a huge fan of the games and have played them all consistently and so I had high expectations of the film version despite my better judgment. The key to making this successful would be to take the best parts of the game story but also create their own back story and details and I think they tried very hard to do exactly that because the film is absolutely on par and does a terrific job with some minor flaws. The film's plot is a little bit complex...I mean you really have to watch to catch on early in the film what's going on. I'm not sure something like this should start out so complex or it could be considered very ambitious on the part of the film maker. Xavier Gens is not really an expert behind the camera...it seems like he's mostly still learning a lot about direction but still he does well with this film and I hope he keeps the reigns for future installments. The film jumps around a lot...from locale to locale and I know they are trying to keep the locations exotic and interesting but the constant moving makes it feel slapped together.There was a lot of concern about Timothy Olyphant playing Agent 47, but I felt confident after seeing him rip up the screen as the villain in Live Free or Die Hard, one of the best action movies of all time. I think a lot of people changed their minds about Olyphant and he does very well as 47. I think he gives the character a little more life than what the game ever did, a little more personality but still has this brooding strength and this capable killing spirit which makes him incredible. If they replace him in the future installments it will be very hard to fill his shoes. Veteran character actor Dougray Scott is terrific as the cop close on the heels of 47 and determined to stop him. Scott and Olyphant just barely scratch the surface of what could be a terrific rivalry between the two men. I would have liked to have seen more between them which is why I hope they return for future installments. Olga Kurylenko is quite good as the witness needing protection by Agent 47. They keep the romance between them to a bare minimum which is good because I think romance would seriously take from Agent 47's personality. Ulrich Thomsen has a small role as the main villain and Agent 47's intended target. The villains in the film are numerous so he doesn't truly get to be the actual villain.The film is appropriately dark and gritty and very violent. There is some really violent scenes which I think is a necessity for this film even if it cuts into a teenage demographic that won't see it. As expected they do play some homage to the video game including a rather forced and yet somehow amusing scene where he smashes through a window where two kids are playing Hit-man 2 on PS2. There is also a hallway scene where they set it up almost exactly like the perspective you would have played the game...a more subtle reference and artistic too. Agent 47 dons numerous disguises, kills indiscriminately when he needs to and despite the very complex plot it does all come together in the end. I think this might be one of the more ambitious video game to movie transitions and it has loads of potential to serialize the hell out of it but I would hate to see a different cast especially in the lead role. Unfortunately I have this feeling that is exactly what will happen. Still it has potential and definitely worth checking out for a fresh, ripping, hip action flick. Even if you've never heard of the game you can get hooked. 7.5/10",Hitman

Before long, he is plunged into a deadly game of conspiracy and intrigue, with relentless Interpol Agent Whittier (Dougray Scott) on his trail and only high class hooker Nika (Olga Kurylenko), who got in the way of his hit, to help him.Like Tomb Raider, this is a film based on a video game I have seen without actually playing the game yet. Well, I had a little go on TR but I've never played this. So, knowing nothing about any of the characters, everything was a surprise to me and I certainly can't judge it on how well it relates to the game it is based on. However, I'd imagine fans of the game were expecting a movie laced with action and excitement, where unfortunately Hit-man falls short, instead giving us a film that tries desperately to be like the Bourne films, trying to weave a twisty turny plot that, despite some neat action scenes, generally leaves you wanting more.Die Hard 4.0 baddie Olyphant takes the lead as the titular character 47, but injects so little humour into his role it's a wonder he doesn't turn to stone. There's also some bad writing on display, as the plot line claims he has been engineered from birth to kill, whereas really he appears more conditioned.No one could accuse it of being overlong (running by at a brisk 90 minutes) and it beats Tomb Raider hands down.

30,tabuno,Not as Good as Its Sequel,6,10 January 2019,"11 July 2017. The most notable difference between this original movie Hit-man (2007) starring Timothy Olyphant and its sequel Hit-man Agent 47 (2015) starring Rupert Friend as Agent 47 as the character of Agent 47 himself, obviously or unobviously depending on how one views these movies. And another, interesting major difference is instead of Dougray Scott as an Interpol investigator on Agent 47's trail in the original, the sequel has primarily Zachery Quinto as whose somewhat sympathetic character has something even more up his sleeve than Dougray Scott's character. These differences add up to something huge and for the worse for the original 2007 version.Agent 47 with a dominant Bourne Identity (2002) music soundtrack made before Agent 47 that offers some compelling energetic accompaniment thanks to John Powell's original music. Perhaps Agent 47 is supposed to evolve over time getting better, but this original character in 2007 oddly enough presents a rather, inhuman persona that's even stiff for an inhuman character. It's almost suggestive of an actor pretending to a trained assassin from birth but not really comfortable in the role. There's even more of an uncharacteristic tendency for Timothy Olymphant to waiver in his portrayal of some oblique but obligatory emotional connection with his female prostitute target. In contrast Rupert Friend in the sequel is able to capture the impassionate mind of a disconnected assassin like Kurt Russell in Soldier (1998) or even a more subtle character presentation like Brad Pitt in Meet Joe Black (1998) as Death.In the sequel Zachery Quinto's mysterious character offers up a stronger and more intriguing counterpoint than Dougray Scott who seems not up to the job becoming more of a fumbling version of Robert Langdon's character played by Tom Hanks in The Da Vinci Code (2006). The action in the original seems sporadic and most of the movie until the ending sequence. Most of the original doesn't have the same energy or power of the best of espionage movies like Enemy of the State (1998), Spy Game (2001), or Shooter (2007).Overall the original Agent 47 movie is a decent if not the most sustaining and powerful presentation.",Hitman
31,johnnyboyz,"All over the place, video-game to cinema screen adaptation which was ravaged in the edit room; more often than not resembling a film you ought to just stay away from.",5,3 February 2011,"Xaiver Gens' adaptation, in 2007's ""Hitman"", of a popular video gaming franchise is a rather unholy mess of everything and nothing; a film which appears to be in a rush to get somewhere without actually knowing where it is it's headed. For all the charging and chasing and darting around that the characters do, on top of what appears to be a complicated and relatively overwhelming espionage plot to do with this-and-that-and-the-other, it certainly is flat and uninteresting. It has bemused many, the idea of a video game adaptation; in the medium of cinema, you have an all powerful audio-visual form capable of doing things and purveying things unto the viewer that we're all aware of – combining mediums of an entirely different ilk in the form of adapting books or plays and so forth in the past has been met with considerable success, but when a video game is brought to the screen, it seems all an author can do is thrash the camera around and blow a lot of things up. Time and time again, even at the best of times, such adaptations have collapsed under such an approach; is there a written rule that dictates video-game adaptations must be as such? Timothy Olyphant plays Agent 47, the titular ""Hitman""; the film wasting little time in establishing the anti-heroic characteristics about him which comes to combine with a sense of the upstanding and justifiable, evident when we observe him in the very first scene holding a Scottish police detective working for Interpol named Mike Whittier (Scott), at gunpoint, in the should-be sanctuary of his own home. The two of them speak, each of them swapping respective stories as to how it was they ended up here and now at the denouement; the film effectively a series of flashbacks documenting what they both did in relation to one another's actions until this very meeting. Where the film wants us to side with 47, is the 47 getting the better of a bunch of rather nasty Niger-based warlords whereas, on another occasion, the observing of him receive a mission labelled ""outside his usual parameters"" before watching him accept it and then pull it off with the minimal of fuss. Such professionalism instantly establishing he's capable of holding his own.Meanwhile, Whittier recounts his working with the Russian agency FSB in trying to apprehend 47; sidekick Jenkins (Offei) in tow as the British officers come across as smart and diligent with their Russian allies a little incompetent and aggressive while often overweight if not a member of a SWAT team. The additional use of the flashback as a means of telling one, long story to a critical show down annoyingly goes a long way in killing a lot of the suspense the film might have otherwise had as these parties mingle and clash. One thing leads to another and the organisation with whom 47 works betrays, whom is arguably their best agent, resulting in everything spilling out into the crux of the film and having ""Hitman"" come to feel very sub-Bourne Identity as the agent is betrayed; goes on the run and comes to bring along an innocent in the form of a young, attractive woman in the process. She is Nika (Kurylenko), a lowlife Russian call girl with whom 47 shares a mite of duality in that both are hunted by respective employers representative of a greater subsidiary of people; both are faceless professionals at what they do; both do what they can to stay beneath the radar despite this and both sport odd tattoos. Very early on, there is a bizarre passage of play in which 47 seems to want to connect with the opposite sex and not only fails at picking up a woman at a bar but reads a little self-help guide on such things; the arc Nika's required for thus becoming a little more obvious than welcomed.The entire thing is obviously nonsense from beginning to end, with Gens' strobe lighting and lens filter effects the primary things you would have had to have taken away from him in order to get a better result; whereas, the overall situation regarding computer game adaptations remains one of a sad and frustrating ilk. It seems frivolous now, but the ""Hitman"" games, in varying releases on various platforms going back to 2000, were only ever as chaotic as you made them to be; the first edition of which arrived during an apparent wave of titles which included 1998's Metal Gear Solid and 2001's Grand Theft Auto III as entrants to franchises giving you a more rounded, more three dimensional experience of the game-playing world provided which you only ever made either as manic or as violent as you desired. The ""Hitman"" games were additionally rather bleak and brooding, the 2004 entry entitled ""Contracts"" in particular had a certain nightmarish quality about it, predominantly down to the lead's own perception on the world around him being filtered through to us via flashbacks and was more distorted than usual because of a gunshot wound said character was suffering from.This 2007 film appears juddery and spasmodic; grossly uneven in tone as it flits from polished actioner to heartless and cold-blooded 'bottom up' revenge film, very little of it ever at all that interesting. When the protagonist in this hurls and twists and bends himself around in a 360 degree motion whilst in slow motion, blazing away with dual machine guns to thumping techno music, not only does whatever slight hope for a decent computer game adaptation receive another nail in the coffin but the name of the game is additionally given a false depiction. Where there might very well be a decent adaptation to be made out of a video gaming franchise or edition, if authors can sort out their priorities, this limp entry into a canon of such films doesn't really come close to being it.",Hitman
32,TheMovieDiorama,Hitman nearly assassinates its source material through a mundane plot.,4,18 April 2019,"Let me go on record by saying this is not the worst video game adaptation out there. It's not. Have you seen Uwe Boll's films? I would go as far as saying I do not hate this film. Does that necessarily make it a good film? Not in the slightest. It often feels like having a laser pointer tracking you for ninety minutes in the hope that the sniper will splatter your brains whenever Kurylenko (typecast as a ""mistress"") opens her mouth. However director Gens does get a few things right. An engineered assassin simply referred to as Agent 47 is caught up in a political conspiracy involving a ""cat and mouse"" chase with other agencies.The main aspect that works perfectly is the casting of Olyphant. An incredibly underrated actor who physically embodies the professionalism of the video game anti-hero. Straight posture, mostly silent and showing off that glossy bald head that blind my eyes when light reflects off of it. Sure, the dialogue he is given is absolute trash and the forced romantic endeavours the plot so wants to have tarnishes the overall character, but Olyphant was great. The same cannot be said for the rest of the cast however. The story itself is pretty much incomprehensibly dull, involving a body double who I'm sure used a ""face mask machine"" from 'Mission: Impossible' and Interpol and FSB wanting Agent 47 for some reason. Double-crosses, narrow escapes and a severe lack of meticulously staged assassinations that the game perfected. Incoherently generic.The violence, whilst excessive, certainly provides limited entertainment, especially when Agent 47 massacres an entire lavish apartment with two sub-machine guns. It shows that he is willing to do anything to eliminate the target, which stays true to the source material. Oh, and he changes clothes occasionally to pull off disguises. Bonus! Aside from that though, it's a wearisome experience that, whilst not the worst video game adaptation thanks to Olyphant's committed performance, will most likely be forgotten about the next day. Yup...already forgotten.",Hitman
33,dee.reid,"""Hitman"" hits and misses",6,26 November 2007,"Watching the new film ""Hitman,"" an adaptation of the highly successful Eidos video game series (which I have never played), you get the feeling right from the opening credits that this will be a hit-or-miss-type of movie. Like a pistol that's loaded, cocked and ready to rock & roll, ""Hitman"" succeeds by remaining true to its source material (even if only in a few instances) and becoming a stand-alone picture in its own right. That's where the hits mostly come from.But the misses are mostly in the screenplay and frenzied direction of Xavier Gens. In a plot that mixes the assassin looking to rediscover his humanity, the hooker with a heart of gold, the video game adaptation, shady politics and the frenetic direction of European action movies, ""Hitman"" should be an action fan's wildest dreams come true. While skilled in these areas, the problems arise in trying to bring it together as a wholesome film and trying to tell a coherent story.""Hitman"" centers on the mysterious and world-renowned assassin Agent 47 (a perfectly stoic Timothy Olyphant), who becomes embroiled in a political conspiracy in St. Petersburg, Russia, following a failed hit on the Russian president. Hunted by a determined Interpol agent named Mike Whittier (Dougray Scott), his men, the Russian military and other assassins, Agent 47's only key to clearing his name is the tragic hooker Nika (Olga Kurylenko), who may have been a witness to the attempted killing. Of course because Nika is sexy as hell, the film allows her two topless scenes, and one attempt at trying to bed Agent 47, though sadly, her character is way underdeveloped, so all we care about are her T + A.""Hitman"" establishes itself nicely in the beginning but loses itself in murky political intrigue that I myself had a lot of difficult trying to sift through. If the script by Skip Woods had taken its time in developing the plot a little bit more, then maybe I wouldn't have been so lost at trying to figure things out. Of course where the film mostly succeeds at, is its bloody action sequences. Where most action films today don't even bother in the way of bloody violence, ""Hitman"" loses itself in these stylish action scenes. Issues abound though with the extremely hyper and tripped-out editing, which tends to take away from the action.The bald-headed, bar-code-tattooed Timothy Olyphant fills his shoes nicely as Agent 47, the man who was literally born to kill, though I honestly thought that the role should have gone to someone a little bit older or more experienced in the realm of action films; of course the actor I would have chosen for Agent 47 would have been Billy Zane, though I'm not sure anyone knows where he is right now so Olyphant will have to do. Olyphant seems to handle himself nicely in the film's frequent blood-lettings, including a four-way shootout that devolves into a brutal hand-to-hand combat encounter within the claustrophobic confines of a rail-car.""Hitman"" is the latest video game adaptation to hit the screens so far and like most entries, it's a hit & miss vehicle. My generic approach to these movies is clear and as follows: ""Mortal Kombat"" (1995) remains the best adaptation of a video game yet, followed by last year's ""Silent Hill"" (2006). Others, like ""Doom"" (2005), and the ""Resident Evil"" films and ""Tomb Raider"" movies, are also above-average efforts, so ""Hitman,"" with its hits & misses, fits right in perfectly.6/10",Hitman

This had enough of a plot and character development to make it work.Okay, the plot is simple enough. A member of the mysterious Organization is contracted to hit a Russian President, which he does. He is then called upon to eliminate a witness, but the witness has never seen him before. Further, the Russian president appears to have survived despite a clean kill shot.What follows is an action packed chase to kill the impostor, while being hunted down by his fellow assassins from the organization, Interpol and the Russian FSB.Timothy Olyphant does a good job here, even though every time I hear his voice, I think of his character in Deadwood.

It reminded me of the (Transporter III), with hints of the (Matrix) and Kurt Russell's character from (Soldier).It follows a genetically-engineered, elite assassin known only as Agent 47. He gets hired for a job in Russia and then double crossed which see's him getting pursued by both Interpol and the Russian military.There are several excellent fight scenes in this but the one on the subway where he takes on the other assassins is just awesome ""how about we die with a little dignity"" -as they drop their guns to have a knife/saber fight. This was cool looking and fun. I ended up feeling very sympathetic for Agent 47's character, especially after (he does the unexpected) and doesn't bone the girl.

(hero mistaken for assassin) hero assigned to track down the assassin) etc etc etc. Now we see them from the assassins point of view. I would hazard a guess it would depend who was cast in the lead.This time its Timothy Olyphant (he usually plays supporting roles this may be his first lead,)He & other's have been trained from infancy to be Killers, they almost are clones with a bar code branded at the base of there bald heads. Timothy played this role perfectly, I believed who he was.. The rest of the cast & the production values are quite good. One does not expect great acting or top of the line production in this type of movie,.The film only cost about $ 20 million Dollars (very reasonable today) It made twice that much in US rentals alone. I am glad for the makers of the film, There is plenty of action & violence, many dead people, BUT thankfully the camera does not linger on the bodies for more than the needed second or 2.The story may be preposterous, some fight scenes may be unbelievable, BUT I was entertained.

The very best of them is on a high profile assignment in St Petersburg. But something goes wrong, after completing his hit his employer seems to sell him out. But to whom, and why? And someone told Interpol, who has been after him for years. Suddenly everybody seems to know where he is and wants to apprehend him, or kill him on sight.Comments: Based on a video game, and it shows. There is a lot of action, a lot of blood and a lot of dead bodies. However, more surprisingly, there is not only action. There is a legit and consistent story. A story with substance, a story which explains every shooting, every twist and turn and without too many big plot holes. So the violence never becomes disturbing as it does in many other actions where the object seems just to fire as many bullets as possible.I liked Olyphant as the more than competent hit-man, but a character that shows flaws where social skills are concerned. A movie so focused on his character depends very much on how the character is portrayed. And he seems very confident at least concerning killing. And there also exists a small but very important hint of humor in him, which makes him likable.So in the end, I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely something to watch again.8/10",Hitman

After a hit mission in Moscow goes wrong, 47 finds himself targeted by the Russian police who want to cover up a government conspiracy, and by E.U. who are mistaking him for another killer. 47 figures out that he has been set up, and decides to go after the people behind it. There is little to the character of 47. All we know about him is the facility where he was trained. Killing is all he does well, and despite such a stiff personality, we the viewers end up rooting for him because he's just so (for lack of a better world) cool! Part of it has to do with the way he kills people in such cunning ways and gets away with it.It is kind of a shameful thing that we find violence entertaining today, but Hit-man is purely artificial action violence so there is really no reason to feel guilty for giving the movie a try.",Hitman

That's honestly about all I can remember of the plot. Dougray Scott is an Inteerpol agent hot on Olyphant's trail. Scott and Olyphant, with his head completely shaved and looking like a young Billy Zane, are far better than the material they have to work with here.

Here is a badass stealth assassin and we get some boy who thought blaming horror films was a good reason to start killing people. After watching the rest of the film you see that he is not the big problem, and you let it slide.The script...my god, the script. If it isn't confusing people at first, it's totally damaging it's source material. Correct me if I'm wrong but since when do these guys carry swords? That entire sequence was out of place in the film and was neither thrilling or added anything to the story. It's one of those, ""Oh, there hasn't been any fighting lately, let's throw some scene in here to keep the audience's attention"".While killing people and stealing their clothes to blend in works in a video game, it does not work very well for film. Anybody with a brain can see that this guy with no hair and a bar tattoo on the back of his neck does not belong with the Russian authorities.While it does have some nice visuals, the script is too weak and confusing that we are never really drawn in to it.

But even 47 couldn't anticipate a ""random equation"" in his life exactitude: the unexpected stirrings of his conscience and the unfamiliar emotions aroused in him by a mysterious Russian woman.I don't know what to expect from this. It looks good, but has been panned by critics so I saw it with an opened mind. Now finishing it, I completely forgot about the movie. That's this movie: Extremely forgettable, yet you still are left with a sense of entertainment. You don't quite remember what happened in the movie, yet you knew you enjoyed it, for all it has got.People may stay away from this movie because the words, ""Based on a Video Game!"" Well, I have never played the video game or read the comic book. I'm just an average person watching a movie. However, you do remember the ingenious action scenes in here. There are actually a handful of smarter (or newer) action scenes that we've never seen before (or I have never seen before).Oh, I almost forgot, this is a dumber version of the Bourne trilogy and I mean that as a compliment. Take all of the dialog and smartness in the Bourne movies but keep all of the action scenes, and then add more action scenes, and there you have it: Hit-man! I really like it because the score is even similar to the score in the Bourne trilogy. Was this trying to be a homage? A rip-off? I don't know, but I did like it.Other than that, this movie is nothing. You watch it, be entertained, and forget about it.

I think I tried one of those before and can't remember what game did the inspiration and the movie didn't leave a favorable impression on me either. But, this one is very good.

Olga Kurylenko as Nika is stunning and quite good. But, it is Olyphant who steals the show. And, I hope we see more of the Hit-man series.

47,oneguyrambling,Big bald bar-coded badman.,5,3 February 2012,"Before I make the seemingly obligatory video game adaptation put down (Rotten Tomatoes gave Hit-man a quite unfavourable and slightly unfair 14% rating) can I say that Hit-man isn't that bad. It isn't that good, but this is no Street Fighter or even a Resident Evil sequel.Hit-man is a game in which a big bald, barcoded badman walks around killing people, then trying to get away unscathed. Simple really. The simplicity of the concept means that the filmmakers have a great deal of wiggle room without fear of reprisals from die-hard gamers. The fact that it is based upon a violent video game also means the main viewing demographic is young men, that also means that violence, action and T&A should be included – and Hit-man certainly provides a smattering of all those elements.Timothy Olyphant is the titular Man, trained from his youth to be a master in the assassin arts and an exponent of many killin' disciplines and methods. He wears a black suit, a white shirt and a bright red tie at all times on the job. He moves quick and packs light, eschewing all relationships and human contact. Hit-man is cool, calm and clinical, he works and sleeps alone.Now as in the game he is bald and has a distinctive barcode on the back of his head – for what reason I can't fathom, maybe his trainers ran him through a scanner nightly before stacking he and his fellow trainees away? – in any case with a distinguishing mark that like on my bonce I just might grow some hair to cover it or wear a hat? The action starts when a job supposedly goes wrong and Hit-man misses his target despite clearing watching his intended mark's brains fly through the air after his bullet explodes through his forehead.After this botch job Interpol are immediately on his tail, with the Russian FSB (think KGB) alongside. With multi-national enforcement on his tail and still more bald, bar-coded dudes in the area looming menacingly.Hit-man – he is never really named – makes the only decision that seems logical to him, complete the job.A young innocent hooker named Nika (Olga Kurylenko), yet another actress who is far too hot to be a real hooker, is inadvertently caught up in proceedings. Finding her feminine wiles of no benefit she finds herself relegated to ride-along status, giving Hit-man someone to talk to and taking every available opportunity to get her kit off – which is a few times boys! While Hit-man works his way to the truth using any means necessary and effortlessly blending in with his luminous bald tattooed skull, while the law and his fellow assassins closing in on the trail the film is OK. Nothing jumps out as being particularly memorable or amazing but the story moves along well and there are a couple of clever moments and decent action, nothing suggesting laziness or a cash-in on the filmmaker's part anyway.The only scene that totally sucked occurs about half way, when a four assassin / 8 pistol Mexican standoff on a train is abruptly cancelled in favour of a hour assassin / 8 mini-swords duel. It was a pathetic, inexplicable and sh*tty scene and I can see how that might have lead for more than a few critics to drag out the red pen for the remainder. But 90% of Hit-man is reasonable at worst, Olyphant is effective as the steely-eyed and determined Hit-man – with an extra 10kg of muscle he could be a good Jason Statham-like action guy – and just when things start to drag 'oop, there goes Nika taking off her shirt again'.It's yet another example of a film without much to recommend, but at the same time you'll be no worse off for seeing it, and you might even find yourself enjoying it at times.Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. I'll stop short of saying Hit-man is one of the best video-game adaptations – it isn't good enough for that – but it separates itself from the bulk of the terrible ones by adhering to tone and trying hard to be entertaining.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com for over 800 reviews and plenty more good stuff...",Hitman

Xavier Gens has a cool visual style, but it's wasted on a terrible script by Skip Woods and a less-than-charismatic performance by Timothy Olyphant.

Along the way, he meets an attractive Russian prostitute (Olga Kurylenko) who might be able to help him. The best thing I can say about the movie is that it's well-shot and has some cool imagery that looks good in slow-motion. The bad is about everything else, although the style does make it a little more palatable. Olyphant was a blank slate as the main character, Agent 47, and his line delivery was borderline abysmal at times. There were some attempts at humor, but mostly his character was bland and his performance lifeless. Olga Kurylenko was also not so great as his would-be love interest/assistant. Her appearance in the film was mostly as a plot device, and her performance wasn't good either. And the villains? Your standard generic Eastern Europeans. Throw in Interpol, and you have the ingredients for what could have been a thrilling, globe-hopping adventure but it just stumbles along from set-piece to set-piece with little logic or reason. What it comes down to is that there is no reason to care about any of the characters on screen or the story. Overall, I'm glad that this came free with a purchase I made for someone else. Otherwise, I would have never spent the money on this turkey. I'll give it credit for having some visual flair, as well as a pretty good score, but the script was DOA. Recommended only for the least demanding of viewers, or if you're a fan of video game adaptations.",Hitman
52,jaredmobarak,That's not a womanHit-man,6,16 March 2008,"Now I have never played nor really heard anything about the video game for which Hit-man is based off of. Besides the whole ""hit-man"" aspect, I guess it is a first-person shooter and pretty popular. Right now, the only reference I have is of the screenshot used in the film, (honestly was that type of nod really necessary?), but from that it seems they at least got the title character's look down. As for the rest, I wouldn't be surprised if it actually gets everything right. By no means is this a great movie. However, when it comes to action packed adrenaline rushes you can do a lot worse. Right from the get-go, following a brief yet thorough backstory montage during the opening titles, we are thrust into Agent 47's world of violence and intrigue and the gas is never let up. Flaws abound, but the fact that the fun never does and that you become somewhat enthralled with the story to see how it all turns out, I will have to say, as far as video game adaptations go, this is an entertaining entry to the genre.It all revolves around a plot to get the president of Russia killed and replaced by a double in cahoots with the country's secret police. Agent 47 is hired as an outsider to take the fall and pressure away from the switch occurring right before the public's eyes. That's truly about all you need to know as the plot takes a major backseat to our hit-man's trek for vengeance and answers as to why he's been sold out. No one cares whether the situation in Russia gets worked out; we just want to see our anti-hero wreak havoc as he is out-numbered by never out-prepared. There is some downtime throughout, but never lasting too long, we are treated with pretty much wall-to-wall action. From the fight at the train station, (at one point hand-to-hand as they are crouched down in a confined space), to the all-out assault on a black market gun meeting, explosions and fists are everywhere. Also, don't be surprised by the amount of blood used. Every gunshot has an exit wound, without exceptionsomething I'm guessing is a constant in the games as well.While I am a huge Timothy Olyphant fan, I find myself thinking that he might have been miscast as Agent 47. The thing about him is his snide humor that goes into every role, whether it a drug dealer (Go), a pimp (The Girl Next Door), or wild-west sheriff (""Deadwood"") he is a master at walking the edge of brutal malice and sarcastic wit. He is given the ability to do that here as well, but it just doesn't quite fit with the character in my opinion, again that of a novice who's unfamiliar with the game. It is just that being such a robotic killing machine, one who has no desire to even kiss the gorgeous Olga Kurylenko let alone sleep with her, makes the humor seem forced. The dry delivery almost reminds me of the awkwardness of Arnold Schwartzenegger's Terminator character in T2. It is a foreign emotion and makes me laugh more at the role than the words he is saying. This is a minor gripe to an otherwise great action performance. I just hope that Olyphant doesn't start taking these lead hero roles and sticks to his bread-and-butter supporting turns that he is so good at.All the other actors do very good work as well, something that is not commonly seen in video game flicks either. Dougray Scott is the consummate Interpol agent, sacrificing everything in order to close the case that he's been working on for over three years. He and his partner, played nicely by Michael Offei, work well together as they walk through what they are seeing and anticipate 47's next move. Even the inevitable encounter between he and Olyphant that bookends the film is a well-played scene. And I always love seeing some of my favorite TV people break into the film world. Despite some horrible accents, both ""Prison Break's"" Robert Knepper and ""Lost's"" Henry Ian Cusick bring some entertainment in small roles.So, as far as action goes, Hit-man ranks up there. Between the choreography and script that allows Agent 47 to be one step ahead at all times, (the booby traps set in his hotel room and guns hidden in the ice box are fantastic), one can't help but root for this ruthless assassin. In the end, though, it is still a video game movie and checks a lot of intelligence at the door, but if I have problems with the fact that we need a subtitle caption for every single location we go to, (they are all in St. Petersburg, I think we can tell the difference between a train station and a police station, thanks much), yet have none with the nonstop action, one will see that the good does outweigh the bad.",Hitman
53,MrGKB,Hits the mark for mindless entertainment...,6,18 December 2008,"...regardless of its video game origins, and if nothing else, affirms Olga ""Quantum of Solace"" Kurylenko as being more than just another pretty face. ""Hitman"" asks no questions, takes no prisoners, satisfying itself with loads of bang-bang, kinetic camera moves, and ample examination of Ms. Kurylenko's charms. Oh, yes, our anti-hero du jour, Agent 47, is played by Timothy ""Live Free or Die Hard"" Olyphant with appropriate gravitas and martial dexterity. I doubt sincerely that Vin Diesel could have done any better, despite having been cast first.That being said, let me repeat that ""Hitman"" is nothing more than mindless entertainment, and I'm glad to see that IMDb voters here, most of whom are outside the U.S., were quite able to recognize that. Olyphant's character is a cipher, a machine for the screenwriter (Skip ""Swordfish"" Woods) and director (Xavier ""Frontière(s)"" Gens) to wind up and let loose. All the people he kills (and there are scores of them) are essentially cardboard cut-outs devoid of any real character, motivation, or purpose. The settings are quite nice, mostly Bulgaria standing in for Russia, and the technical aspects of the film are commendable: as mentioned, superb camera-work from Gens collaborator Laurent ""À l'intérieur"" Barès, a solid score by Geoff ""Disturbia"" Zanelli, and excellent production values all around; ""Hitman"" looks far pricier than its ostensible $24mil budget. I suppose that's the advantage of shooting in Eastern Europe.Plot? Who Cares? ""Hitman"" is concerned only with the slickness of style and blood, and the explosion of squibs. Turn your brain to the ""Off"" position, sit back, and enjoy a shoot-'em-up. That's all you're going to get. Oh, well, that and Ms. Kurylenko's lovely breasts.

A poor video game movie.,3,26 January 2015,"(28%) With its muddled, awkward, messy plot; overblown action, and bog- standard direction making this yet another poor computer game adaptation. And why almost all movies based on video games screw around with the standard plot so much is something only the bean counters at the studios can properly answer as this feels like something made not by a writer/director/producer, but a large group of money men. As far as performance go there's Timothy Olyphant being a bit too baby faced for the role and largely miss-cast as Agent 47 because the real silent assassin does not, and never will have an American accent. Or big damn swords hidden away under his shirt for that matter either. While the script is from the pen of one of the worst writers in Hollywood history, enter Mr Skip Woods (I wish he'd skip off).

56,jon.h.ochiai,Hit-man on Target,8,26 November 2007,"As Agent 47 played by Timothy Olyphant aims his gun at Interpol's Mike Whittier (Dougray Scott), he asks, ""How does a good man decide when to kill?"" That is the paradox of Director Xavier Gens's slick ""Hitman"". The screenplay by Skip Woods is based on the video game ""Hitman"". I am unfamiliar with the game. Movie genesis from video games usually does not bode well. However, ""Hitman"" surprises with narrative and visual style, and the charismatic Olyphant as Agent 47. Olyphant (recently seen in ""Live Free or Die Hard"") has a decidedly dark air about him, and wisely underplays the role. Also a surprise is Olga Kurylenko who plays Nika, the woman 47 must protect in the enveloping conspiracy. Kurylenko is stunning naked, and surprisingly she is a genuine and compelling actress. She embodies vulnerability and smarts in what could have been a one dimensional victim. Analogous to ""The Fugitive"" narrative pretext, director Gens expediently overlays the origins of the mysterious 47 as a youth bred and trained to become the perfect assassin in the opening credits. Is he really a ""good man""? ""Hitman"" is puzzling in that the movie trailers appear more polished than the actual movie. Perhaps Gens was a music video director? Or ""Hitman"" is resourcefully produced on a medium budget? Some of the action sequences in ""Hitman"" are breathtaking. There is the automatic weapons orchestrated mayhem in the Russian night club. The deadly fight scene with 47 and assassins from his own Agency is an amazing martial arts displayknife fighting, joint locks, and close in boxing. Olyphant may not be a trained martial artist, though he is a graceful athlete. The slow motion and slick editing evoke the dramatic. On a very basic level ""Hitman"" delivers with its darkly powerful hero, beautiful women, spectacular action, and engaging story.As played by Olyphant, 47 is the classic enigmatic heroin the sense that we really don't know if he is really a villain from the start. 47's paying client hires him to assassinate Russian President Mikhail Belicoff (Ulrich Thomson). Belicoff is a merciless despot. 47 completes his mission; however, he has been set up. His employer informs 47 that there was a witness to the assassination attempt: the President's prostitute Nika (Kurylenko). She must be eliminated. Investigating the assassination coup is Interpol Agent Mike Whittier (Scott). Hindering the Interpol investigation is KGB Agent Yuri Marklov (effective Robert Knepper) claiming KGB jurisdiction. Whittier believes Belicoff's assassin is the ""ghost"" killer he has been tracking across the globe.47 distinguishes the conspiracy and becomes the inadvertent protector of the vulnerable Nika. Their relationship reveals the more human side of 47. Humorously awkward and touchingly believable Olyphant and Kurylenko's partnership is an undeniable strength. They have a sublime chemistry that works. And 47 emerges as a hero and a man of honor.""Hitman"" is solid entertainment that benefits from Gens's stylish direction, and star-making performances from Timothy Olyphant and Olga Kurylenko. ""Hitman"" is a great hero story about an essentially good man vanquishing great evil and protecting the innocent. The movie is engaging fun.",Hitman

And since I don't play very many, and I've never played Hit-man, let alone heard much about it before this movie came out, I have to judge what I saw on the merits of the movie alone.So all I can say is this: if the looks and charisma of the star of a film is all it needed to become a box-office success, then this movie should've been worth about $250 million when it was released. Tim Olyphant, the conflicted good-guy of DEADWOOD, of all people, establishes himself as someone worthy of possibly snagging the title of the ""male version"" of Angelina Jolie. It's been a while since a lead actor has looked this good with a gun in each hand, especially in something this completely outlandish. The other big plus? Olga Kurylenko. One look at her here, and you can understand why she's the new Bond girl in the upcoming QUANTUM OF SOLACE. Other than that, there's not a single thing here that makes Hit-man any different - or better - than RESIDENT EVIL, SILENT HILL or any other video game-based movie.

59,ajs-10,Not rubbish... But not very memorable either...,6,25 June 2011,"I have seen this film before, but it's one of those films that isn't exactly memorable whilst at the same time it's not exactly rubbish either. It's kind of hard to explain really, but I think it's a lot better than some 'scores' you'll see on the internet might suggest. It's based on a video game and as such, like many others of its type, it suffers from trying to be too much like the game. I thought it was actually quite good in patches, it just failed to deliver at the crucial moments. Here's a brief summary before I give you more of my thoughts.Our Hit-man, Agent 47, was brought up from an early age to be a Hit-man. He is hired to assassinate a Russian politician, Mikhail Belicoff, and he carries out his instructions to the letter. Imagine his surprise when the same politician appears live on TV the very next day. Add to this the fact that he is being pursued by an Interpol Officer, Mike Whittier and the Russian Secret police are also getting involved. He discovers the politician has a lover, Nika Boronina, who he kidnaps, hoping to get more information from her. He finds himself drawn to her in ways he's not used to. A hit is put out on Agent 47 and people from his own employers, 'The Organization' are now also after him. It's time to strike back and this is where I leave it. I don't want to find a mysterious bald man sitting in my armchair when I get home one stormy evening.As I said at the beginning, this film suffers from trying to be a little too much like a video game. There is quite an over-complicated plot that really doesn't have a strong narrative which doesn't help matters. Performance wise, I thought Timothy Olyphant did a decent job as Agent 47, he certainly had the look. Dougray Scott was adequate without really breaking a sweat as Mike Whittier and Olga Kurylenko did a decent job as Nika Boronina. Also worthy of note were; Robert Knepper, sporting a natty Russian accent, as Yuri Marklov, Ulrich Thomsen as Mikhail Belicoff, Henry Ian Cusick as his brother, Udre Belicoff and Michael Offei as Jenkins.Unfortunately this film did have a bit of the look and feel of a 'Jason Bourne' film and we have already seen at least one of those. The fight scenes were all very well done and there were some spectacular explosions to keep the kids happy (that's a joke by the way). An over-complicated plot didn't help matters, but at the end of the day I did find it entertaining, if not very memorable (and I've seen it twice!).

60,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Misses the mark,5,28 November 2008,"It seems that whenever big budget filmmakers have a chance to craft an action film that strays from the norm and shows something new, they revert back to age-old formulas. Not always, but more often than not. ""Hitman"" is an example of just that. The video games were enjoyable for their dark atmosphere, slowly rising tension and increasingly compelling environments that permitted ever complex strategy of seek and destroy. The back-story of Agent 47 also took on some interesting turns.This movie manages to take all that and squash it into a generic action film formula. Everything that made the game enjoyable and different - namely the zeroing in on the kill; the infiltration of dark urban underbellies, mansions, or posh hotels - are all strangely missing. Agent 47 is still that stoic callous killer, but there is virtually nothing in the film that propels the viewer into his world and thus there is virtually nothing that makes the viewer like the main character. The little things there are, are purely superficial in the form of action hero antics that are mildly enjoyable. The plot however, is a some tired political conspiracy as fresh and original as in any cheap paperback novel.If anyone wants to see Agent 47 on the big screen, this is inevitably the place where they should go. This film also doesn't succumb to the temptation of the the ""safe"" PG-13 rating thus some of the grittiness of the title character is here, but the execution (pun intended, sorry) could have been much better. --- 5/10BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence",Hitman

This man has killed too many people around the world and now he's being chased by the Interpol. But it's not easy to catch him, not at all! The next target of AGENT 47 is the new president of Russia. The plot is not as easy to follow as expected, because at parts it seems that everyone has a double! The action scenes are good, with great special effects, but they are a bit exaggerated sometimes. The acting is not great but is good enough. Timothy Olyphant really looks like a killer machine (and also looks like a robot at parts! lol!).

The movie is fast-paced--perfect for the modern sufferer of ADHD--and the crisp cinematography was appreciated.

64,moviesleuth2,Glossy finish can't save this flick,4,23 June 2008,"This is the first video-game to film adaptation I've seen, and if this represents the best of the crop, then I shudder to think of what the rest are like.Actually, the transition (where so much is apparently lost in the rest of the ill-fated attempts) doesn't seem to be the problem here. The problem is the story. It makes no sense. The story is so filled with plot holes that it's amazing that anyone greenlighted the script. This is especially surprising since the version I saw was the unrated version. One could argue that the added footage is what made it confusing and should have been left out, but this movie seemed like it was swiss cheese right from the getgo.A man known only as Agent 47 (Timothy Olymphant) is assigned to assassinate a leader, but is somehow framed and now looks for the people who set him up.That's about all I could get in terms of the plot. Kind of sad, isn't it? Especially from Twentieth Century Fox, who obviously spent plenty of money on this film.This film would be unwatchable had it not been for the performance of Timothy Olymphant as Agent 47. In fact, he nearly saves the production. He's excellent as the cold, conscienceless killer. While he's not effective when he suddenly has to show emotion (he slips out of character at these points), this doesn't happen much. That said, Olymphant somehow manages to be somewhat sympathetic despite his lethal nature. Olymphant wisely doesn't model his character off of Arnold Schwartzenegger's performance in ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day,"" though there are some similarities. Apparently Vin Diesel was attached to this at the start of production, but as much as I like Vin Diesel, I think Olymphant suited the material better than Diesel.Also of note is Olga Kurylenko as Nika, the prostitute that Agent 47 has to bring with him (the circumstances in which this arises are never competently explained). Despite the interesting relationship between Nika and Agent 47 never being very developed, Kurylenko is interesting enough that she and Olymphant make this film watchable. Kurylenko is the new Bond girl in ""Quantum of Solace,"" and she shows potential for acting as well as her beauty, so I am anticipating her performance.Xavier Gens may know how to make a film look good, but he can't save this movie. Everything here is stylized, and very interesting to look at, but that only makes the reception of the movie worse because it deserves a better screenplay. Maybe it was because I hadn't played the video game. But maybe it was just a bad screenplay.Credit goes to Gens for not trying to directly lift everything from the video game into the movie. History has told us that something is always lost in the translation, and the film adaptation has to make up for it in other ways. Gens takes the essence of the game and develops it from there. This should satisfy everyone, gamers and non-gamers alike, but the plothole-filled story may make producers unwilling to try this again (though the number of games set to be made into movies is may serve to refute this hypothesis. We shall see.) Avoid this movie, unless you are a producer looking for new actors with some skill. Timothy Olymphant and Olga Kurylenko are ones to watch.",Hitman

There is absolutely nothing wrong with that idea. It has been done before and in some cases it has worked. Silent Hill and Resident Evil come to mind for instance. In this case it doesn't work out. The film features too little violence, too little tension and looks too much like a heavily watered down version of The Bourne trilogy. There are a few sequences that are very nice to watch, but the bulk of the film is too slow for comfort. There's some unnecessary nudity thrown in as well. It doesn't support any function and therefore makes the film worse instead of better.All in all, I can't say I have enjoyed this film.

67,willcundallreview,Acting with no life at all,3,28 March 2015,"Rating-3/10Hit-man is an action film that really doesn't make much sense, I can't really think of much to say more than the plot is incoherent and really makes no sense by the end. The thing is at the start you feel maybe the plot will be pretty epic and quite an exciting adventure, but It just isn't and it ends feeling overdone and weirdly stupid. I felt it to be a second-rate movie and here below is why so.The acting is the main reason I disliked this movie, they give it a go but it feels like the entire cast is just poor. Timothy Olyphant our nameless assassin who goes by Agent 47 is poor, Olyphant is really awkward in his role and never feels comfortable being who he has to portray. Dougray Scott is also poor as the Interpol agent Mike Whittier and he just feels yet again, awkward and as if he is confused where he is. The thing is the cast aren't made up of bad actors, they just don't work with the characters there given and the script is also to blame.And on to the writing we go, it is probably the second worst if not equal worst thing alongside the acting, stale, lifeless and confusing are just a few words which spring to mind. And on to the acting again, the script makes them feel lifeless too and when the lines are delivered there either hard to follow or just too stupid to follow anyway. I think what it needs is a little more darkness in Agent 47, who seems to change from bad and good every second and never feels chilling enough with all the violence.It has a lot of fighting action, thrills, actually not too many car chases but a lot of guns. It could be said there is too much action here and although it has it's thrills as I say it just feels overdone and almost too violent. It is a bit bloody at times and if it is possible too many people die, I mean he is an assassin yet he kills more people than an army could, seems too OTT as all.On that point if your going to base it on a video game, please don't make it feel like I am playing it myself. Now I say this because video games are usually the most OTT you can get and with things like Hit- man that rings even more true, the action seen here just feels too much like a game and the way in which the technology works and the weapons too just feel straight out another instalment of Hit-man the game.I can't say it didn't keep me interested in all fairness though, I felt like watching it and it keeps you drawn in until the end, even if the plot makes little sense. I think the one main positive is the suspense, I mean even though you know he will be going absolutely insane just to kill one person, the part before he does it is thrilling and fills you with a sense of what's next etc, until he goes in and goes yet again OTT.So yes overall this did make me feel it was a rubbish movie, it isn't awful or terrible but is still a bad instalment of action movie. In conclusion the plot is too confusing, and the thrills and action are not good enough to properly fit in to movie greatness in this area, it isn't even a typical case of it's so bad it's good, just more a case of forget it and move on.",Hitman

Then it finally, no pun intended, hit me: Mike Whittier, the persevering Interpol investigator, is none other than Desperate Housewives' Ian Hainsworth (Dougray Scott).

71,backup-50362,"Underrated, maybe? Understandably so.",6,30 April 2018,"I never thought I'd see 47 smile or be seduced by some thot but here it is. The movie - not exactly in tune with the game as anyone would expect. However watching this AFTER watching the 2015 Hitman movie, I gotta admit...At least Timothy Olyphant looks like 47. He plays him well.The movie is clearly shot in Bulgaria but pretends to be in Russia, which fails to fool anyone considering you can see Bulgarian text on the buildings. And it features several popular actors you know damn well aren't Russian and are just doing lame accents. Why did you need it to pretend to be in Russia even? There's also some massive lip sync issues, I don't know why almost every scene looks dubbed. What's up with that?I assume the reason this has low ratings is because it's not true to the game. I wish it was too. But after watching the garbage 2015 Hitman movie - again - this doesn't look half bad at all. It's just not true enough to the original material, so understandably, people aren't happy. I guess I can say for one - Olyphant is a good Hitman. If only his voice were a little deeper. And he didn't smile or show that much emotion.As usual, the writing is where it goes horribly wrong. In both Hitman movies they just gotta introduce a female love interest or whatever instead of focusing on 47, so the both movies are actually kinda more about the female characters, which is a super generic way to make a safe movie. Introduce a semi-atractive woman, add some lame love interest, completely derail the movie's relation to the game... If you needed a female so bad at least make it Diana, but no, she almost doesn't exist in this movie. Nothing you'd expect does. As with the other Hitman movie - it's just a safe action movie slash love flick, as generic as ever.But again, this movie is slightly more close to the game and 47 looks slightly more like himself than the other one, so it's the lesser of two evils. But no, it's not that great. It's just good. A good action movie. Not a good Hitman movie.Adding lame old scream sound effects 10 year olds used in their Flash cartoons 15 years ago didn't really make it feel any better.",Hitman
72,MCMAYNERBERRY,Couldn't Point Out The Point,7,6 April 2008,"Based on the top-selling, award-winning video game franchise, the Hit-man is a genetically-engineered, elite assassin known only as Agent 47. His hallmarks are a lethal grace, unwavering precision, and resolute pride in his work. But even 47 couldn't anticipate a ""random equation"" in his life of exactitude: the unexpected stirrings of his conscience and the unfamiliar emotions aroused in him by a mysterious Russian woman.The Hit-man (Timothy Olyphant) is a mysterious and complex man of profound contradictions: He was bred from the world's deadliest criminals, but raised by an exiled brotherhood of the Church. His very existence seems to be a sin, but he wages a quiet war to rid the world of evil. He's brilliant, charismatic and charming -- yet reveals little about himself, has no name, and is known only by the last two digits of a barcode tattooed on the back of his head.

73,dvc5159,"One of the best video-game to movie adaptations, and it shows.",6,1 December 2007,"Nowadays, Hollywood seems to be running out of ideas to find new stories to make great movies. So, they turn to adapting video-games to movies in hopes to strike gold for the producers. The results are often mixed, with a ludicrous plot and and hammy performances by A-list actors who can't make a straight face throughout the movie, at the same time blowing the money away on big special effects, which help to boost the ratings, but that process faintly succeeds. And the movie loses its credibility altogether.Thankfully,for Hit-man, it is done right.Here, we have our Agent 47(who is perfectly portrayed by Timothy Olyphant, with steely resolve) who's trying to find who set him up and why after a botched assassination attempt in Russia, resulting in a hot-headed Interpol agent (Dougray Scott) and the Russian police on his heels. Also, he gets romantically linked to a Russian prostitute (Olga Kurylenko) who is also involved somehow in the mix. Thus, 47 plans his next move, swiftly and cunningly.Before you go and say (wha- THAT's NOT WHAT 47 IS SUPPOSED TO BE!), there is great plot development and characterization, mostly thanks to writer Skip Woods, who clearly has done his homework. He adds in even the finest detail to make the movie similar to the game by adding a lot of references (from adding Agent Smith and Diana, 47's array of tactics used in the game, and to his signature Dual .45 Silverballer Pistols), and finally to adding his own elements to create a refreshing plot and thus improve the entire storyline. Woods' screenplay contains a good characterization on 47, making him a more human character, but only in a few scenes, as most of the time he is performing brutal and bloody kills, and even locks fists with members of his own. Plot holes are there, but you become engrossed in the movie and plot that you just forget all about it and just hope to see what happens next. The chemistry between actors is effective, especially between 47 and Nika, the prostitute. Also, Kurylenko provides some great eye candy for the men... That aside, in a nutshell, the story is good, and that is unusual for a video-game movie.The direction is good. Xavier Gens manages to capture the mood and the feel of what the movie is supposed to be like, dark and moody, just like the game. The action scenes are well-filmed, and very fast-paced. They show the efficiency of 47's killing potential, and the bloody end of his targets. The music is also nice, it varies from fast paced during action scenes, to being haunting and beautiful whenever something sinister is about to happen. Together with the beautiful cinematography and perfect lighting during certain scenes, the combined elements make up the perfect setting for the movie. The film also includes the Ave Maria theme, used in the Blood Money game during the opening credits.As mentioned earlier, Olyphant portrays 47 with such steely resolve, . I heard complaints that he is not right for the role, and that the fans want someone more suitable to play the role, like Jason Statham, Vin Diesel (..shudder..), or David Bateson (the original 47 for the game and strangely resembles him as well). Thankfully, Olyphant pulls of the right keys and makes the character into his own while not forgetting the elements that made his character great in the first place. In fact, I could not imagine any other actor portraying 47 more correctly than any other actor that comes in mind. I am sure that Olyphant will find much success later in the future, and will get better, possibly more recognized roles sometime soon. But, as for 47, I smell a trilogy coming up ala Bourne Identity, as the film leaves us wanting much, much more.Overall, this is how a video-game turned movie should be. A movie in which the action sequences do not take itself seriously but it gets engrossing during the characterization. Overall, fans of the game will be pleased and the movie is worth your buck. I really hope the movie will be a success, if so, then I will look forward for the next installment as I am hungry for more.6.45/10Delton",Hitman
74,TheHoodOfSwords,Meh,5,14 July 2020,"Hitman is a dumb action movie with too much dumb and too bad action. That's the best way I can describe it. The whole movie feels like a video game (although I wouldn't know how accurate since I've never played the Hitman games) With each place seeming just like cutscene after cutscene. The blending in is half-assed and most of the action is terribly edited blockbuster nonsense. The only good parts are the damsel in distress type character and one action scene at a train. The line delivery is flat and awkward most of the time and there are a couple terrible ADR moments. The CGI and effects, in general, look pretty laughable. You'd think that a movie dedicated to action would have at least some half-decent action. All the weapons look fake and like they were purchased at a Dollar Tree.

It was definitely ""LoDef"". Scenes were out of focus and the resolution even in set up scenery shots was poor. Most of the movie did not make much sense. The story was minimally just enough to provide some reason to show events on the screen but each scene was hardly tied to an overall structure. It was just one gory action scene after another just for the sake of having an action scene. I gave the movie a 3 rating only because Olga Kurylenko had nice long legs.

78,squirrel_burst,Please... make it stop.,1,7 February 2015,"Critics have denounced ""Hit-man"" as yet another video game turned into a terrible film, but maybe you're one of those people that think they just followed the ongoing trend of hating on those type of films (you're wrong) or maybe you're wondering why exactly this movie sucks as much as it does. Well, after seeing the unrated version for myself, it would be my delight to point out exactly why this movie is so bad. The plot is riddled with plot holes, but I will contain myself with a simple synopsis and then we'll dig into it a bit later.The film follows Timothy Olyphant as a hit man with no name, so we'll call him ""Hit-man"". As a young boy he was collected and trained in a mysterious organization only known as ""The Organization"". They train men to be skilled martial artists and gunmen to send into the world and kill for money. They shave the heads of their agents and tattoo bar codes onto the back of their heads... Hit-man's next target is Russian President Mikhail Belicoff (Ulrich Thomsen). In an unusual request, he is to kill Belicoff in public. After the kill, Hit-man in instructed to eliminate a witness, a woman named Nika (Olga Kurylenko). When Hit-man approaches her, he realizes that she is not, in fact a witness and that HE is the target to be eliminated.This is a movie that moves just quickly enough that while you're watching, you're not asking too many questions but once it slows down even just the tiniest bit, it falls apart completely. This plot makes absolutely no sense. First of all, if you're a super secret organization, why would you make all of your agents easily identifiable by making them stand out like sore thumbs in the middle of every crowd? Bald guys with bar codes on the back of their heads don't exactly look inconspicuous. Next, couldn't you think of a better name than ""The Organization""? If the idea is to sound so silly that no one will believe you exist that's a step in the right direction, but maybe you shouldn't label all of your agent's equipment with your super secret logo, that might be a dead giveaway that all of these bald dudes with guns are linked together. That's just the tip of the iceberg because our ridiculous protagonist is caught in the middle of a conspiracy so amateurish and poorly scripted it sounds like it was written 15 minutes before the deadline, and by a 13-year-old.Let's break down the master, evil plan that drives all of the action of this movie. Step 1) Get some bad guy plastic surgery to look exactly like the Russian president. Step 2) Kill the real president and take his place. Step 3) Eliminate all witnesses to the assassination and anyone close enough to the real Belicoff to tell the difference between the two. Step 4) Get re-elected and proceed with further super-villainous plans. Step 1 goes perfectly well and is pretty much done the moment the conspiracy is set up, since the person responsible for hiring Hit-man is already the president's double. Step 2 makes no sense though. Why the request to make the killing public? If you were trying to make the ol' switcheroo, wouldn't it be much more logical to kill the real Belicoff quietly, clean up the crime scene and sneak in the new guy? That's where Step 3 makes even less sense. The real Belicoff is killed in broad daylight, in the middle of a crowd of hundreds. Was the plan to kill every single person in the crowd that might have seen Belikoff get killed? What about the doctors and ambulance people who picked him up, where those guys in on the conspiracy? And the guys who disposed of the body? How widespread is this thing? Then, all the people that are put on the ""to be silenced list"", there are seemingly only two that need to be taken care of with swift and silent deaths: Nika and Hit-man. You would think that the plan would be as follows to implicate as few people as possible: hire Hit-man to kill Nika, then kill Hit-man. That way you only have to pay one guy for two kills, what a deal! But they blunder that step too! Why did they even feel the need to kill this Hit-man anyway? Our protagonist is an assassin. What is he going to do, assuming he finds out about the conspiracy? Go to the police and tell them he knows that the man in power is not the real Belicoff because he murdered the real one? As a cherry on the sundae, they send another hired gun from The Organization to take out Hit-man. Hmm. First of all, you have to assume that training these agents is pretty expensive and that there aren't that many of them out there, so it seems strange that they would so easily dispense with one of their own members. Also, we know Hit-man has to get his ammunition and custom equipment from some kind of special source, so just call the guy and say ""Hey, come back to warehouse 1, we have a new shiny gun for you"". When he shows up, just slip him a poisoned sandwich or something. Hey Organization, hire me! I'll save you guys billions of dollars and you won't have to train me to do anything! This film is a colossus with feet made of toilet fudge. Not only is the plot totally ludicrous, but our main character is about as interesting as a block of wood. It's actually painful to watch these actors dredge through this abysmal material. I'd go on, but you get the idea. It's just yet another terrible action-oriented video game-based movie.

79,TheHande,The Bald and the Beautiful,9,14 December 2007,Hit-man adds a new decisively more serious tone to the series of video-game movies. Though still rather hyper it keeps a safe distance from reality and becomes a film that you can enjoy without hesitation. What the film offers is a combination of well-shot action sequences and a deadpan comedy that allows this cold movie to have a warm center.The audio-visual side of the movie is nearly flawless. The action-scenes are carried out with Hong Kong style professionalism and the excellent soundtrack provides a perfect reflection with a violent symphony. Despite the blood the film doesn't become unsettling or unpleasant to watch and this is a good thing since the violence and action is merely for flavour and not the purpose of the film's story.The character interaction between 47 and Nika is also refreshingly different from most other action-movies. What I found surprising was that the movie didn't dwell so much on 47's rather traumatic past and therefore the film moves along without unnecessary stoicism. And while comedy is always up to personal preference I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the comical exchanges between the two.From a plot point of view the story isn't too complicated but serves as a working setting for the film's events. Undoubtedly the core of Hit-man is a difficult thing to get a handle on but a little bit of confusion goes a long way in my view. When the ending credits start rolling you are left with a feeling of satisfaction.,Hitman
80,shadowman123,Satisying ...,6,24 December 2007,"Although I am a big gamer , Hit-man was not really on my list of games to play but then I had just recently bought The Hit-man triple hit pack for the Playstation 2 and thought I would also give the movie a shot. I felt that Hit-man has been realised at the wrong time of the year as this did not typically feel like a winter movie but it still got the job done. Although I am not that familiar with the concept and how true they kept in spirit of the games (I am very particular about those type of things) , what I can say that on action levels it just seems like a rather Luke warm film. I mean was not expecting an arts movie with a name of a computer game like Hit-man but then yet again it would of been nice to show an effort. The plus points of this movie were that well it dived straight into the action right away without setting the tone slowly , from the trailers (which made it look like a film that could go toe-to-toe with Die Hard) it lived up to its promises of action and there were some genuinely good action scene's . The film also moved at a good enough pace which which although I felt was occasionally drifting off in places quickly dragged it-self back on track. Timothy Olyphant done a good enough job as Agent 47 although I believe someone like Bruce Willis or Jason Staham would of been more suited for the role, the movie also made some good reference towards the game. Having said that Hit-man moves at a quick pace but then along the way it feels a bit chaotic in most places! For one , it seems to lose grip of its plot half way through and we forget what was Agent 47 original mission and his new intentions, another thing was the 'clever' or smart or maybe even 'cool' dialogue to me it just felt awful. Another thing is that Olga Kurlyenko who plays Nika felt like to that she was trying to pass her-self off as Asia Argento ... a very bad version of Asia Argento , and the half cooked romance angel was just unnecessary and not needed. To some it up Hit-man is not the best of computer games to big screen adaptations but having said that it does deliver what it says on the package and it does not completely feel like a waste of time as it does what it is supposed to do and that is entertain us, worth a rent for fans of the game and action genre.Hit-man : 6.8 OUT 10TO PROTECT US , HE WILL KILL...",Hitman
81,kooleshwar,"Guns, Babes, Explosions = Simple B-movie Fun",6,19 December 2007,"I actually had some expectations from this movie, Im a big fan of the lower budget and simple action flick, and the trailer actually had me very interested.Let me also say that i don't play video games and even though I'm very well read this video-game just isn't popular enough for me to know much about, unlike say earlier adaptations like doom or mario etc, or the coming halo.The movie basically follows the formula take a popular video game, make it into a 100 min script, put in a decent actor, a hot exotic chick, and stuff it full of guns, explosions and a bunch of good one liners.Yet somehow this movie fell bellow my expectations, and i have a feeling the Indian Censor Board had lot to do with, scene after scene of gratuitous violence and nudity fell pray to their hypocritical morality. So much so that even some of the dialogues that i saw in the teasers were butchered.Despite this fact there is no doubt that the film has its weakness's such as :- 1)Lack of a good villain, a staple of older movies nowadays its hard to come across a good one, a powerful hero needs a powerful hero to really shine.2)No really big scenes.3)Weak and much rehashed script, almost everything has been seen on film before.4)Timothy Oliphant? While i agree he does have charisma and did carry of his role quite well there is no doubt in my mind that it could have been much better, he was good in the cool parts, but he just didn't look menacing enough when he had too.Other than these things this movie is quite good.Olga looks smoking hot even with the punk look, when she dresses up she crosses over into the amazing territory, too bad the censor board cut of most of her hot scenes, but she was one of the best things about this movie.Some of the one liners are really good, especially good were the conversations between Olga and 47.Many of the action scenes were well done although, the extra effort for cool did show, nice to see swordplay in what was otherwise a gun film.Humour wasn't bad either.In all a simple fun B-movie with loads of satisfying bloodshed and hot scenes.Not for everyone obviously on people who appreciate such simple action films will enjoy this one.-s weak script,poor villain, no big scenes, the extra effort shows in a bad way.+/-s timothy could have been better??.+s loads of bloodshed and hot scenes, good acting all around,good dialogues, OLGA.total 6/10 (this movie did fall below my expectations and I've been true to that, cant help feeling that this movie will be much much better without censorship but i don't want factor that in, maybe when i watch it again on DVD (which i will, when i don't know) i may just come back and change a few things or post another review.",Hitman

Action, stealth, a good story and well forged characters are all present and clear in the game. However when they had announced Hit-man would be making a debut on the big screen i felt a little concerned and worried about its quality that is shown in the games. The main one being, weather it would obtain its 18 certificate and weather its violence would be as great and graphic as it is in the games. I was sadly wrong on both accounts. The violence in the film is so inevitably poor and unfocused on how the game was, and the 18 certificate so many people had hoped for.As for the films story and characters it remains true that it isn't anything like its game. No emotion or accurate dialogue, no great story.

83,JaydoDre,"Hollywoodanized and failed to capture the point, yet enjoyable",6,26 November 2007,"Let's get straight to the point. Movies that are adaptations from popular games have a very high chance of failure and Hit-man has not escaped that fate.It is very hard to make a movie from a game because something that's fun to do over and over in a game, will be boring to see or not possible to translate in a movie.The hit-man from the games is a ruthless character. Of course he had his dramatic childhood and he won't kill unless he absolutely has to, but when the job asks of him or when he is crossed, he won't think twice; he won't play a hero; he won't lose his nerve and he won't stop before anything to achieve his goal. The movie makers have distorted that image, at least partially, to make the character marketable. They went as far as squeezing a woman into the heartless world of Hit-man.The makers tried copying the game's highlights and details, but they failed to copy over the big picture. Moreover, they didn't do a very good job choosing what to copy over. The cool computer screen that gamers see when being briefed about their next mission looks childish in the movie. The dialogue sounds similar to the dialogue in game and yet, in the movie, it sounds so cheesy, and at times created soly to clarify what's going on - a cheap trick. The dialogue is definitely one of the low points.As much as I hate the desecration of the realistic assassin formula, I must say that the movie is enjoyable. It could've been a much worse job. The makers tried hard to compromise. The ""hitman's woman's"" existence, for example, is made believable through a connection Hit-man feels with her, which has everything to do with his past.Perhaps movie directors should bring fans to help direct these kinds of movies...",Hitman

Your audience should be everybody with the potential to want to sit through your movie. True, you have to be relatively faithful to the source material, otherwise why bother with the source material at all?, but the requirements of making an interesting movie should come first and foremost.I liked ""Hitman"" well enough.

I thought he uses more fist than guns in the movie. Anyway that does not matter.The story is straight simple. It does have some twists like for in fact, Agent 47 disguises himself and things like that. He gets pursued by so-called cops. He did his best in exploding them or shooting them dead.

87,kevin_crighton,Violent and bloody mess...,4,30 November 2007,"Hit-man is the latest movie to be made out of a video-game. The problem with making movies out of games, is that you have to make the movie appealing to those who have never played the games, and at the same time not to change too much that it will alienate it's key audience : the game players.I've not played the game. But as a movie there are problems. The plot follows a hit-man, No.47 (no name) as he tries to figure out who is trying to kill him after an assassination appears to have gone wrong. He teams-up with a prostitute, Nika after an attempt on her life as he works out what is going on. Meanwhile an Interpol agent, Mike Whittier, is trying to catch him.The script is a mess. The plot doesn't really sit together at all. The reasons behind the attempts on 47's life are confusing, the whole back story while hinted at never really helps the story move along. The action scenes aren't bad although considering he, along with others work for a secret organization, their attempts at killing both others and each others are at times poor and way off! A case in point is a 4-way Mexican stand-off, that results in a 3-on-1 fight with swords! The director Xavier Gans suffers from the same faults that a lot of new directors suffer from : over-editing. This may be due to certification/ratings for the movie (this is a 15 in the UK), but I suspect it's just the director and editor getting carried away. I wish directors would allow action scenes to play out without this fault.The cast aren't bad, at least those given something to do. Timothy Olyphant as No. 47 handles the action well, and even allows a hint of humour in the character. Olga Kurylenko as the girl thrown into the mix is simply eye candy. Dougray Scott as Whittier doesn't really get a lot to do, except look puzzled at times hunting 47 down, but as for the rest of the cast, they don't really register.I suspect if this made a lot of money there will be sequels.

89,Ozzy2000,Really dumb,3,6 July 2008,Timothy Olyphant plays Agent 47 in a truly B grade film in which he manages to avoid gratuitous and wild sex with the very eligible Nica Boronina played by Olga Kurylenko who keeps putting out for him. Nica was apparently witness to Agent 47's failed attempt to take out Belikoff president of Russia played by Ulrich Thomsen.A very silly cliché espionage type of hit movie. Agent 47 magically appears in new suits all the time which is very impressive.A short and forgettable film.Bad Bad Moronic. Stupid.

Kurylenko is a huge star in the making and the rest of the cast was also decent.i have never played the video game so i didn't have that crutch to start with. this is definitely one of the better action movies i have seen and it is very gory and violent...but very well done. the story line was semi-lucid and that is all you need in a good action movie. the special effects were top-notch and actually everything was good or excellent except for the semi-lucid story.i was surprised, never once did i get bored watching this movie and i have to say that Olyphant as a person and personality wise...you just have to like the guy, hes very likable and a very bankable star and i'm going to try to watch everyone of his movies.fans of a good action movie, you are not going to be disappointed and fans of Olyphant wouldn't be either!",Hitman
93,simonparker1990,"One of the best video game adaptations, not saying much is it",5,30 November 2007,"I've played many video games where I have sat and thought how great a movie they could make, Prince of Persia, Halo, Bioshock, Tomb Raider etc, the story lines are intricate and the character original. So why oh why has ever single video game adaptation seemed so weak? The two Tomb Raider movies have been pretty poor, Doom was mediocre at best, the Resident Evil movies a disaster and the less said about Suoer Mario Brothers the better! I have never played the Hit-man games, yet I had high hopes for it, as the premise seemed initially very good. So what a shame to say this is yet another very average video game adaptation, admittedly its one of the best adaptations, being placed alongside Doom, yet unfortunately this still doesn't make it a good movie. The movie does start pretty strongly and the character of Agent 47 remains a truly intriguing one. In fact deep beneath the poor editing, stupid script and bizarre storyline there is a good movie waiting to be made, unfortunately you have to look long and hard to get these glimpses. Timothy Olyphant does work very well as 47, despite my early doubts about him he does prove his acting ability and does a cold, steely performance. The action is also very well done, a sword fight especially being noteworthy. Unfortunately the storyline literally kills the movie, while starting off strong I swear the writers forgot about it and just had random segments appearing and disappearing. By the end of the movie I wasn't sure who was who anymore and was left a bit confused by it all. While its nice to see a storyline in this kind of movie, its been so poorly thought out its more a rushed mess than anything else.As I've said Olyphant really did surprise me. My only previous experience with seeing Olyphant act was in Die Hard 4.0 earlier in the year, he did an average job in that movie, mainly because he never seemed right for a Die Hard villain. In this movie he seems more at ease, especially when he seems distant. He has some very good moments and he seems to actually look the part of 47 after a while, I understand now why he was chosen. Unfortunately his weakness comes when the script gives him a one liner to deliver, it just seems forced and not right. While some of his one liners are amusing he just doesn't seem at ease saying it. The lead female of the movie is played by Olga Kurylenko, she definitely is one of the worst parts of the movie. She plays a Russian hoar, who for some obscure reason 47 seems to fall for. Her character seems relevant at first, then she just becomes an annoyance. We get a horrific sequence where she talks of how she dreamt of owning a vineyard, its so ludicrous that it made my jaw nearly hit the floor. Dougray Scott does a decent job of the inspector after 47, in fact he seems at times to have more screen time than 47 does. His storyline is interesting and he has some decent moments, but he does seem very pointless after a while. The rest of the cast are just too pointless to recall to be honest, I was never truly sure who the villain of the movie was so won't even go there.The action of Hit-man is definitely its highlight and what makes this movie almost get a 6/10 rating. The shootouts we get are very cool and superbly executed, a sword fight is the most impressive of the movie, and the movie does deliver in its thrills and share of cool moments. A shame then that the movie does start to feel like a series of cool moments strung together by a stupid plot. Characters appear and die, characters betray characters, plot lines are never resolved, the beginning and ending scenes that bookend the movie just seemed a bit unnecessary and loads of other things are wrong with the plot. The script also causes huge problems, Scott definitely gets the worst of the dialogue, he has lots of nasty scenes where he says how good 47 is, it just seems painful after a while. The editing is also a problem, it is blatantly obvious where scenes have been cut and the editor seems to have cut too much, leaving certain events a bit unexplained and random.Overall Hit-man is a bit of dumb entertainment, but it is also a major disappointment. When you realise this is the best video game adaptation to date you realise how bad the video game movies before have been. Oh well, lets all hope the Halo or Gears of War of movies get going and try and do well.",Hitman

But the reason why I took a point off of my review is that Hit-man's story can be really confusing at times. Like, after a while, you go what's with all the 47 clones? (Watch the movie and you will understand). Timothy Olyphant was really good as the mysterious killer who doesn't speak much and thus, does not reveal much about his identity. Olga Kurylenko was also pretty good as the sex addict who accompanies 47 on his adventures. This sometimes lead to very funny scenes (like when she is on top of him and tries to have sex but he knocks her out with some device). Overall, Hit-man (unrated version) is worth checking out for 1 hour 30 of your time.",Hitman
96,native_girl333,Mild Hit-man,5,5 April 2008,"""Hitman"" is based on a popular game and the fact sure can be seen.Agent 47 (Timothy Olyphant) is a one of the hit-man's from a organization of killers. The organization has raised and trained them. At this time Agent 47 gets a assignation to kill the president of Russia. He finds out that the gig is a set-up case...Surprise, surprise: the police is also after him.It is a some kind of guideline that whenever anything is popular amongst the people it has to be made as a movie also. ""Hitman"" is a fair action-packer but the plot is unfortunately thin as ice. There is some great choreography moves but that is quite there. Timothy Olyphant is somewhat charming as Agent 47. He manages to be woody and stiff as a trained killer should be. Still there is a human side somewhere deep in this hit-man's heart. His soft spot is definitely a hooker Nika (Olga Kurylenko who is soon to be a next Bond girl). A heart-throb Dougray Scott is also on board but his characters stays a bit distant.""Hitman"" is a mediocre action film but nevertheless it is entertaining!",Hitman
97,brettchatz-1,Shoot to kill!,6,28 November 2007,"tarring: Timothy Olyphant and Olga Kurylenko Hit-man is a low-octane action adventure. It stars Hawaiian-born screen sensation Timothy Olyphant as the hard-hitting hired gun. This assassin however is more suave and sophisticated than British agents of the same vocation, but Agent 47 (Olyphant) lacks character depth and pizazz.The story tracks the violent exploits of this assassin, turned liberator, as he moves across Eastern Europe and Russia in search of rogue leaders and doppelgangers. As a man who never misses the mark, he is surprised to learn that one of his targets has mysteriously survived a high-velocity projectile.With Interpol and the FSB hot on his tail, Agent 47 is unsure who to trust. In a world of treachery and counter-intelligence, he seeks an exit strategy alongside a former Russian prostitute (Kurylenko) who gets caught up in this bloody mess.The action comes thick and fast; the script is woeful, but the overall impact of the film is entertaining.

100,wynonasbigbrownbeaver,"For some reason, it was better the 2nd time.",6,18 September 2008,"I hated this movie the first time. I think it was because it deviated from the game I loved playing so much. As soon as agent 47 whipped out samurai swords, I was thinking to myself. Oh god, the whole movie is now ruined. Since when did he go head to head playing Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon with other hit men in the game? I had to get past that part. I thought he should have acted with more stealth. I just got dumped before the release of this movie, and I didn't even notice the token hot Russian chick until the second time around. The directors cut is far better, just because it shows more. The Token Hot Russian Chick also saved the movie from mediocrity. In retrospect from seeing the 2nd one, I thought that this movie deserves the credit for being stylish. Yes it is Eurotrashy, but Hit-man takes care of the villiains. I think the only real disappointment of this movie is that we expected it to be something it wasn't meant to be. The director obviously didn't play the game too much. If you want a slick hit-man movie, Leon the professional is a great, great movie.

So based solely on the film 'Hitman' the director was the failure of this film being more of what sliver of good it was.The overall acting and casting (other than Olyphant which did a really good job, better then this film deserved), were out of sync right where the director could have synced them.The writing... had a favorable direction however fell short of giving it the mystic, excitement and believability it should have had.Knepper... so good to see him and he was one of the better actors however even he couldn't save this thing.The action sequences, fight scenes in particular, were not emotional and the editing was too fast to get any 'feel' from it let alone passion for it.All in all, this could have been a 'very' good film, made an appetite for another installment and projected Timothy Olyphant more toward the 'other go to guy' for possible action and cool guy roles yet Xavier Gens, trying hard or not, seems to me responsible for none of that happening.

Before i saw the movie i thought it was going to be an action packed film and boy was it so. This is exactly john wick but just a bald guy, contract killing, no dog, and some heavy nudity at time anyway lets talk about that. Being a hitman film you wouldn't expect there to be that much nudity rather any at all, but this film has 2 or 3 graphic scenes that last about 30 seconds or so but it wasn't that bat all in all. The games had some nudity in it so that might explain it. im glad that the movie was not rated pg-13 because i feel like titles like these could have been yet i wanna see some blood and gore and there was a fair amount. in the beggining, the special effects like explosions look kind of bad. But later in the movie it was ok. I dont know if they used bad effects in the beggining to save up for the rest of the good parts of the movie. my favorite parts of the movie would have to be either the train station fight or the casino club fight. The casino club fight had heavy gore and some bada$$ slow motion cool effects yet the train station scene had swords, SWORDS.

103,mike-925,Mechanical Response to a Robotic Thriller,5,27 November 2007,"Hit-man is based on a video game. There is also some Quentin Tarantino Robert Rodriquez input to the film.But Hit-man's main character reminds me of the lead character in a groundbreaking TV series called Profit that went nowhere on Fox TV for six or seven episodes in the early nineties. Profit was the most malign lead in a TV series who had ever been devised. His role was to undermine the corporations he works for and the people he works with. He was hard to rout for. He got sympathy for his childhood. He grew up without parents or emotional contact. He was raised in a cardboard box. Hit-man has a similar background. How could Fox have risked putting a series like that on?It gets easier and easier as relationships between men and women continue to decline. Hit-man refuses to make love to the squeeze who crosses his path in the film, though she is writhingly appealing.The video game addicts who are the audience for this film can't wait to get back to their computer terminals so its no problem that lead Timothy Olyphant wants nothing to do with the girl.Right away I noticed how inhuman and video game-like the character and the whole movie are. The characters need no emotional contribution from me or anyone else as part of the audience. I laughed at the more outrageous action scenes because there was no chance I would spill emotion over anyone in the film.Hit-man is a mechanical thriller that lets you know of its soulessness right away.

104,jcallows,"Like Bourne Identity, but sexier and with more gore.",7,30 November 2007,"I really liked this film. It was fun. Though it's based on the video game, it really borrowed heavily from The Bourne Identity-- right down to its music. Combine this with some Leon: The Professional, a bit of Dirty Harry and any typical John Woo film, you have The Hit-man. There are probably a few more films it borrowed from, but these were the ones that came off the top of my head. Anyway, despite the lack of an original idea, this film was very enjoyable to watch. Key to its success was the performance of Timothy Olyphant. He was great to watch. Even as he was committing evil deeds and killing in cold blood, it was difficult not to like him. He somehow brought depth and sensitivity to his character which made it easy to empathize with him. So it was easy to root for him as he was trying to achieve his objectives. I should also note that this film was bloody. When people got shot, you got to see the impact in all its glory. I haven't seen such graphical depiction of people getting shot since RoboCop. But it was appropriate for this film. What would you expect from a film called The Hit-man? Anything less would be unsatisfying.

Still, it is close enough to the video game that I enjoyed it. If you don't know the video game I would think you might think it a Bourne rip-off. Ya, not what other reviews have stated. I am on the fence as to the fleshing out of his personality vs the video game. I think their interpretation was less than and yet better than in some areas. So overall it was a wash for me, a good interpretation of the characters. The differences that others have mentioned regarding the movie and the video game were not a big concern for me. In those examples, I think the movie is better. Overall this was a good presentation of the video game character vs No One Lives Forever and the travesty they did on Archer by making her male for the series. In that sense, this movie was refreshing that they kept in line with the video game so well. Had they not mimicked the Bourne movies to such a degree I would have given this movie a 10 star.",Hitman

He constantly looks for ways to conduct his work without injuring innocents or even alerting them to his macabre task.The creators of Hit-man were inspired by Luc Besson's assassin movies such as Nikita and The Professional, Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs and the popular action movies of the Hong Kong film industry.

108,Jerominator,Under-rated game/movie adaptation,8,26 May 2013,"I don't think you necessarily need to have played any of the games to watch this, as the basic premise is laid out pretty well throughout the course of the movie. Obviously it doesn't hurt if you've played the games though. For my part, I only played Hit-man Contracts. So while I appreciated some of the movie/game nods, I was also watching it with one foot outside the door so to speak.I didn't go out of my way to see this as reviews were positively Luke warm and from experience of such game adaptations that usually means it's bad.So I was pleasantly surprised with what I found here.They picked great actors for the main parts - Olyphant seems to have eluded major roles in movies - what a shameful waste - there are just too many good actors in Hollywood now, and yet still undeserving wrestlers or comedians land major parts when fine actors like Olyphant fall by the wayside - what painful idiocy.The backdrop to the movie is a clandestine organisation that trains assassins from birth in a kind of warrior-monk fashion, before sending them out to do its bidding. We join one of these assassins as a grown man having already notched up hundreds of hits. He's hunted by interpol, and on the verge of expediting a highly unusual public assassination of a world leader.This is a major turning point and the drama unfolds from here on in, with the hit-man hunted by interpol pursuers while simultaneously trying to solve the puzzle of his own predicament.OK so there's nothing mind-blowing about the story, yet it is exactly the type of story you would expect to find in such a game. Moreover this movie earns points for acting, fidelity to the style/spirit of the games, and just a clean and polished delivery of the story.There are some neat homages to the game - in the way the movie looks overall, but also in certain scenes and details, e.g. when he's walking down a corridor, how he holds his weapons, the concealed katanas. Hell there's even a glimpse of some kids playing one of the Hit-man games in one scene! There are some things that could possibly pass as naff or ridiculous if this were not based on a video game, but I firmly believe these were deliberate choices in keeping with the style of the games e.g. helicopter gunship attack on the cathedral dome, pseudo-military units, far-fetched medical procedures. So given the context I think those things are entirely forgivable and appropriate. In line with that I was relieved they didn't opt for the A-Team-esque avoiding killing people so not to offend small children and parents, but kept true to the nature of the game and had the cold killer coldly killing whoever he needed to. It would have been a terrible choice to go the A Team route and would've murdered the movie.I honestly can't recall a better game to movie adaptation, and I've seen some bad ones. I'm genuinely stunned more fuss wasn't made of this when it came out, and further stunned that no sequel was made. Either dire PR or bizarre Hollywood politics at work.Anyway if you've played any of the games, you've *definitely* got to see this. If you haven't, but like movies like The Bourne series or Equilibrium, then I would also recommend this.",Hitman
109,BobbyT24,I haven't played the game but the movie is terrific,7,31 July 2015,"I will preface this with the fact and apology I have never played the video game. Honestly, I'd never even heard of it before watching this movie. I must also state I like Timothy Olyphant in pretty much anything he tries. :-) I found this DVD at the discount movie store for $1 and thought, ""Why not?"" I'm soooo happy I purchased it.This movie is exactly as it states: It's about an Unrated Hit-man that acts more machine-like than human who tracks down and eliminates any and all targets without the least amount of emotion. Just cold, bloody murder-for-hire. You will figure out where he came from within the first few minutes of the film so there is very little mystery when the movie starts. What followed, however, was pure, violent entertainment. It was stylish, sexy, brutal, graphic and genuinely enjoyable as a movie experience. I truly believed Agent 47 could live/kill/slaughter without emotion. It was stylistically up in the ""Kingsman""/""Lucy"" range of movie violence. That is high praise as far as I'm concerned.I'm not giving anything away by saying there is a lot of killing. And the director obviously perfected original, graphic ways of portraying said death. It takes a special someone to create new ways of celluloid bloodiness without going overboard into the Tarantino-enthused ""blood explosions"" that are both non-realistic and off-putting. ""Hitman"" had the necessary blood-letting, but refrained from becoming the crazed, unrealistic, explosion of human tissue bloodfests so associated with the Tarantino-like crowd.Timothy Olyphant was perfectly cast. I understood they thought of other actors for the character, but Olyphant really was Agent 47. His expressive eyes and the ability to convey venom and danger by simply standing still was marvelous. Dougray Scott played the tortured, ethical Interpol operative trying to track a ghost with excellent restraint and tenacity -- think Stephen Rea in ""V for Vendetta"" and always being one step behind a genius of mayhem. You gotta feel for a law enforcer who has to track someone as beautifully violent and elusive as Agent 47.Olga Kurylenko is gorgeous and very sexy as the prostitute/witness. This is NOT a PG-13 movie, hence the ""Hitman UNRATED"" title. Spoiler alert maybe - this movie has nudity. You can read that in the ""Content Advisory"" section of this site. Sorry to the folks who are against that part. But if you can handle an unrated movie about an emotionless hit-man killing people with gusto, seeing a beautiful actress in various stages of undress shouldn't be all that shocking.For a movie I hadn't heard anything about and bought for $1, this was one of those excellent surprises I always hope for. After watching literally thousands of movies, it is refreshing to see something with some originality, style, charm and intelligence. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good action movie with a wonderful protagonist acting exactly as a hit-man should - he gets his prey and doesn't apologize about it. Watch this one. I think it is worth your time.",Hitman

The plot of this movie is to assassinate a double president,now although the original president was assassinated,the hit-man was setup by his own company to die so that the double could take the originals place. But as we all know,you don't get rid of the hit-man so easily,and yet along for the ride was a hooker who obviously thought she was going to die,ended up being 47's new best friend. Kind of like having a little sister at a distance. Throughout the film i was amazed by the similarities of timothy and agent 47,the calm demeanor,and the calculating precision that the hit-man can only achieve himself. All others who were educated like himself just doesn't stand up to his prowess and fluidic combat. I guess you can say he was the star pupil for assassination school,and for good reason. Not one of his ex classmates could take him in any way,not even under full duress and obvious distress.

116,baberchik,How NOT to make a video game adoption,1,11 August 2012,"What do you call a movie that has a trailer showing what does not take place in a movie, and a movie that has almost nothing that happened in the game? In polite IMDb terms it's called 1 out of 10, in real life - use your imagination. I have to write some spoilers because this movie is all about soaking up what good plot the game had to offer: 1) have a good close look at Max Payne. THAT is how you take a game and make a movie that is true to the storyline. This the the exact opposite. Good basis for the move would have been either Hit-man 2 or 3, or 4 if they just kept to the main plot and take short digresses, kind of flashbacks to give the story more meaning. Those had the most beefy story lines, and went deep into showing what stuff Number 47 was made of. Remember - this is not Leon, this is a genetically engineered killer. He is handicapped in every social way possible, except for what he needs for his job. 2) Why invent a loosely knit storyline? Why invent a fake eastern European country? This is not even worth talking about. My advice is this: forget this movie, play Max Payne 2 and watch Max Payne the movie. That is how it should be made. This movie however is trash that made it to the theaters just because of the name and the hype around it.",Hitman

After completing the games Hit-man Contracts and the best game I have ever played in my life Hit-man Blood Money I was restless for the movie. After watching the movie I was disappointed it had no where near as much violence as the Hit-man Blood Money game and not enough violence. 3/10 for effort and 4/10 for violence. What this movie needs is more sex, more swearing and a LOT more violence. It also would have been better if the plot was the same as Hit-man Blood Money. Come on a different rival agency battling against this one would have had a lot of violence. This movie needs the following improvements-more sex, more swearing and a Lot more violence.",Hitman
118,bujinbudoka,Felt like it was straight out of the game,8,19 March 2008,"As a fan of both games and movies I'm highly reluctant when they decide to make a movie of one, especially one I like to play. Example: House of the Dead. But this was no Uwe Boll shlock and when I watched this today I was pleasantly surprised as it held onto what made the games so appealing to me and many others while telling a real story about Agent 47, his planning of a job and how he carries it out, and a great story (slow at times) but good nonetheless to carry him through.Raised from birth, Agent 47 (played well by Olyphant) is the most skilled of skilled assassins in the world. When given his latest hit against an up and coming Russian President he find himself set up by his employers and pursued by both Interpol and the Russian government. Along the way he meets the typical hooker with a heart of gold and together they try to discover who and why he was set up in the first place.I must say I enjoyed this movie for many reasons. Yes, the story is a little to be desired but it was well played in the action sequences and even sometimes a little gory but there is a lot of realism to me in it. The hand to hand scenes are well done and Olyphany really pulls off the character of Hit-man as seen in the games. Many times I felt as though I was watching the video game itself come to life with the camera angles, the tactics used and the pace. I definitely enjoyed the way they pay homage to the character as well! My only complaints are the constant changes of scenery and locale, and the interactions between the main characters at times did seem a little off for what would really happen. But in the words of Howard Stern I guess sometimes you just have to suspend disbelief, sit back and enjoy the show.If you want a good action movie this is definitely one for you.",Hitman
119,myrkeyjones,"Great production values are let down by editing, script and Fox fascism",5,7 December 2007,"High expectation was had for the film. Many where worried that problems would arise from the takeover by editor Nicolas De Toth from Xavier Gens by the power of Fox. Never heard of De Toth, he's famous for editing Live Free or Die Hard down to a PG-13 Rating. Despite the fact that 'Hit-man' is has an official hard R rating, This quarrel is not with the lack of violent content, but the incredibly poor editing, which intern, spoils that fantastic cinematography. Another issue with the film comes at the end involving Scott and a certain side character that certainly could have been trimmed out of the film. Out of Nowhere Scott's lines appear obviously dubbed, for what reason it is unknown, as well as the other, a rather pointless character, whose lines ensue laughter at the strikingly obvious poor dubbing. Don't get me started on the story, the continuity and geographical issues, the awful Russian Accents. Not Even a hugely entertaining performance by Timothy Olyphant can save that fact that this cut of the film is flawed, and has obviously been tampered with by Fox. Now one can be curious to see the Directors cut, It felt like a good hour of material was missing, whats worrying is that material probably doesn't exist. time will tell whether it was the fault of Genns that the film was not cognitive. For some reason the editing in the action sequences was more than adequate, like De Toth has simply cut parts of the original cut with white flashes. Despite, Olyphant, Scott and some great action, Hit-man really is the best straight to video flick ever brought to the big screen. Recommendation: Set your expectations low, quite low, in fact.",Hitman

Well, about the movie, It stayed mostly true to the video game but instead the agents were orphans instead of clones(Haha, I've read the hit-man video game in wikipedia.org so I know a thing or two about the game even thought I haven't even played or even seen it yet). There were many great action scenes and nods to the games, such as Agent 47 stealing various outfits, his weapons and his odd ways of killing his targets. The movie is so great that I... Well, can't seem to find the right words but.. this is what future movies should be like when they're adapting it from a video game.The character that I love the most is Nika (Olga Kurylenko). She's so amazingly HOT in this movie and has various topless scenes which made me happy :) and she's a great actress and I can say that she gave it all in the movie. I think Timothy Olyphant was THE perfect Agent 47 and captured the character perfectly I would definitely see this movie multiple times!!!!!, Well, I have seen it 5 times in a row, well why not repeat it again huh?!

Was really hard to take this movie seriously and half way into the film I totally lost interest. If you want to make a hit-man movie you should follow the line of the Bourne movies, intensity and high level of risk. In hit-man everything seem to be easy. The fighting scenes are OK, just OK, nothing more, but once again, the plot is just stupid. I truly believe that maybe Jason Statham was a better choice for the role of 47.

I played every Hit-man game and love the series and was really hoping for something enjoyable. In the end, I was quite disappointed because despite being a good action movie, it didn't have all the little things I knew and loved Hit-man series for.The game is known for character's ability to infiltrate and deliver silent kills rather than swish his gun around and shoot everything that moves while fighting on swords and jumping off balconies. The action in the movie just didn't give the game any justice. The choice of the protagonist was simply not right as well. Timothy, though a good actor, just wasn't right to be the 47. His babyface ruined the mysterious feel of the Agent and the excess of nudity was simply too superfluous. The lack of silent approach, fibrewire, knock outs and other little things that made playing Hit-man and making it to Silent Assassin status fun, were all absent from the movie.Overall, the film concentrates too much on pleasing the ADHD crowds and excess of action rather than staying true to the game series. This would have worked with the Tomb Raider, but not Hit-man.4/10",Hitman
124,Exeron,Not true to the game at all!,3,25 January 2008,"Many people said that this was better than expected, i couldn't disagree more. I had pretty high expectations, i love the game so i hoped the movie would be good. First the movie wasn't true to the game at all, Hit-man was transformed into James Bond and Timothy Olyphant didn't play him very well. His voice is far to light to act someone like 47.And what was up with this romantic crap and major shootouts. Hit-man doesn't spend his time with woman in fact he doesn't spend any time with anybody, he's kinda like Léon the professional. And the movie had some side plots about Interpol vs the FSB which was so dorky.I mean you wanted to be proud of the movie as you are to the game. You wanna say "" There's a movie of it too, it kicks ass"". That's not going to happen even in my dreams.Many people says that this is one of the best game adoptions ever, now that i might agree on, i mean it was a decent action movie but it made no sense to the game.

125,klesker,Oh dear.....,2,10 December 2007,"I'm afraid the time has come for a rant. Out of sheer lack of having something to do, I went and sat through all two hours of Hit-man last week. I left the cinema wishing I'd read the next 100 pages of the frankly dull book that I've been plodding through. But hey, it's far more interesting than the latest, god awful computer game adaptation to hit our screens. Yes, Hit-man was balls. There are worse movies out there, based on computer games but this weak and boring action film is still balls.You'd think they'd have gotten it right by now. We've been ""treated"" to three Resident Evils, two Tomb Raiders, a Doom, a Silent Hill, a Street Fighter, a Super Mario Bros.the list goes on. Yet none of them have been any good. Not one. Nada. Zip! It just seems to be a pre-requisite that all movies based on games suck. It must be in the contract of all involved to make these movie so truly awful that they've now become the skid-mark of the film industry.And now we have Hit-man, which continues this glorious trend. As with all of these films, on paper, it seemed to be cool. For anyone who's played the games, the plot centres around a hit-man by the name of Agent 47, a gun for hire, genetically engineered by a faction of the church. He is mean, heartless and totally ruthless, feeling no guilt or remorse for his actions. He oozes cool (bald head with a bar code slapped on there for good measure) and kinda reminds you of Jean Reno from Leon.But Leon this most certainly ain't. This is a lazily crafted movie that showcases no real merits of talent. I feel almost sorry for Timothy Olyphant at the titular hit-man of the film. He is usually a fairly consistent actor and quite a joy to watch. Just look at him steal every scene he's in during Doug Liman's Go or as the second of the two killers in Scream 2. But here it seems as though he really can't be bothered, and who can blame him, with direction this sloppy and acting this abysmal? Lets talk about the direction for a moment shall we? Director Xavier Gens shows very much that this is his first movie. He's cack handed with the action (one sure fire sequence in which Agents 44, 45, 46 and 47 engage in a four way sword fight is p*ssed up the wall), and really has no idea how to pace a movie. There is no build up to anything, it just happens. It feels like a car on it's last legs, stop, start, stop, start. Maybe he should watch the Bourne Ultimatum a few times to see how you create truly awesome action sequences. Either that or stop making movie entirely.The supporting cast members look truly uncomfortable in front of the camera. How Dougray Scott still manages to get work is beyond me. He is, without a doubt, one of the worst actors working today and here he gives one of the worst performances ever committed to screen. He is truly terrible. Olga Kurylenko, as 47's main love interest, is totally unnecessary. Her only purpose is to walk around naked on the odd occasion in some vain attempt to make the movie that little more interesting. She fails.I think my one main gripe with this film is that Agent 47's actions seem, well, amateurish. When I imagined a film version I imagined it to be like the opening of Leon, where our protagonist is able to take out ten people covertly and professionally, without anybody really seeing who he is. Instead we get the all guns blazing approach. Not very professional for a man who is supposed to be the top assassin in the world.It's just a missed opportunity. It could have been greatness or at least a pretty effective action movie. Instead we get a mess of a movie, and insult to the action genre and a bad mark on Timothy Olyphant's consistent and solid CV. The only thing it has going for it is it's not Silent Hill. But then again, it was based on a computer game. What did I expect.1/5",Hitman

Timothy Olyphant is very good as the all-action Agent 47, but Dougray Scott arguably steals the show with a subtle yet heavyweight performance as the Interpol chief desperate to get his man. Throw in the pre-Bond beauty of the stunning Olga Kurylenko, and there are enough components here to avoid all the usual clichés.

The action is blood thirsty and there are a lot of bone crunching killings, none of the gore is tamed. The story wasn't too bad, the conspiracy is well thought out but what isn't is the dialogue. The only thing that seriously let's this film down is the weak lines that have been given to characters. Especially Dougray Scott's lines. Moving on from that minor down side, there is some dark humour in some scenes which will amuse and topless Russian girls.

129,nethlyn,Both the story and the soundtrack of The Bourne Identity have been ripped off - but it's short enough for a good rental,8,28 December 2007,"It's a spoiler in itself to mention the plot of Bourne Identity since the makers of Hit-man cloned some of it rather nicely whilst weaving in aspects of the video game character's genesis. Even though I own all the games I haven't completed them so I don't consider myself a Hit-man fan. In the UK this has been pitched as a Christmas movie and the Carry-On styled showing of flesh rather than explicit nudity of the film (despite the flesh on show) as well as the release date, places it firmly in the James Bond arena.I was willing to cut the film some slack because like Tomb Raider's first film, it was cut to 95mins and didn't outstay its welcome or attempt to be a heavyweight feature. The casting is mid-level but the acting is better than expected and shows us that one actor previously known for Prison Break can act in more varied work. A British hero in a Hollywood release is certainly a rarity and Dougray Scott seizes the opportunity, loading all the clichés onto the conveniently black comedy sidekick.Just like the video games, the viewer needs to suspend their disbelief that this bald guy walks around with a bar-code on the back of his head and no-one points him out to either police or mental hospital attendants. Unlike Resident Evil Extinction there was some effort made to give both fans and newcomers a big-screen movie. It took me three weeks but I'm glad I finally went to see it in the cinema. I plan to buy this on DVD, it's another good first film for an Eidos game franchise and will tide me over until the fifth game is released. Worth a rental.",Hitman

I thought it looked like one of the best attempts at a VG adaptation from the trailers/ads, and if nothing else, I thought the action junkie in me would enjoy it.I was somewhat disappointed. I wouldn't necessarily call it a bad movie, just underwhelming. Dougray Scott was relatively bland, and I feel Olyphant played Agent 47 too straight - he wasn't all that interesting. However, I must give props to Robert Knepper (Prison Break, Good Night and Good Luck, Hostage). He was definitely a big highlight, and one of the greatest redeeming features of the movie.The action was pretty good (a scene involving an arms dealer especially stood out), but for a film adaptation of Hit-man, I was left feeling that the amount of overall action was somewhat lacking.I would agree with critic William Arnold of SeattlePI in describing some of the lines as ""Ed Wood dialogue."" Well, maybe not quite that bad, but every now and then I heard something that made me cringe. Maybe it was the delivery, maybe the writing, but I wouldn't describe this aspect as the movie's strong point.I'd give it a 5/10.

I have also played the video games for Hit-man and they have been awesome and could not wait for the movie. My favorite Hit-man video game is Blood Money because you can use the sniper a lot.

136,shaneo632,"Not terribly faithful, but it could be worse...(MILD spoilers)",5,3 December 2007,"Shaun Munro's Reviews (ShaunMunro.co.uk):Hit-man, the adaptation of the excellent computer game franchise of the same name, will undoubtedly have fans flocking in their droves to witness slick assassin, Agent 47, on the big screen. The horde of fans bring with them the minute glimmer of hope that it will join the few game-to-film adaptations that, frankly, haven't been derivative, uninspired messes.What is apparent very quickly is how preposterously miscast Timothy Olyphant is as the protagonist  he lacks the deep, suave voice of David Bateson, and I'm left wondering why Bateson himself wasn't just cast. Of course, Olyphant, who, I have nothing against, is becoming quite the household name, whilst Bateson's score sheet is distinctly empty.The basic premise of Hit-man involves Inspector Mike Whittier (Dougray Scott) on the hunt for Agent 47 (Timothy Olyphant), who is purported to have assassinated over one hundred people. 47, however, is a phantom, rarely leaving a trace, and even more rarely being outsmarted.Hit-man, like the games on which it is based, travels all over Europe, docking for a while in St. Petersburg, a central location of the second game in the series. As a militant fan of the games, this pleased me, but as soon 47 begins taking shots at the bar and interacts with a cute Russian woman, who professes to him the importance of drinking etiquette, I began to lose faith. This is a film which, like this year's horrendous Redline, people will love to label as ""Eurotrash"", and whilst I dislike the term, it is rather apt from the outset.Fortunately, at least to an extent, Hit-man attempts to remain in the vein of the games  Hit-man is frequently as cold and callous as ever. His assassinations are swift, but mostly lend themselves to the brutality of the games. With its generous squibs of blood, and fair instances of breasts on display, this isn't a PG13 endeavour, although the screen is hardly showered in blood either. As hard as everyone on board tries, I will never, for the life of me understand why screenwriter Skip Woods felt the need to have 47 partake in the ever-clichéd emotional shower scene.Fairly early on in the film, the central storyline from the games is suggested (involving clones), yet, as with 47's past, it is never expanded upon in any satisfying detail beyond a brief spell of grainy, blink-and-you'll-miss-it flashbacks. Ergo, if you've never played the games, then I imagine that parts of this film will leave you utterly clueless  through and through, this is for gamers above all else.Behind all of the tussles for jurisdiction and bad Russian accents, this could be a far worse adaptation  as a SWAT team descend upon 47, it is incredibly reminiscent of parts of the second and third games, even if it employs far more theatrics, and, to be precise, many more preposterous explosions. That said, the game counterpart of 47 was a clear-cut anti-hero, and here I'm not so sure. He effortlessly kills SWAT team members, yet these men were not party to some sort of maleficent conspiracy  they were merely men doing their jobs. In the games, near enough everyone 47 killed deserved it.Moral values of assassins aside, in investigating the supposed re-emergence of a man he killed just hours earlier, 47 comes into contact with the man's girlfriend, Nika (Olga Kurylenko) who, as you can quite rightly guess, is the love interest of our story.The contrivances just pile on from here, with insanely lucky escapes and ridiculously slick disguises. One can tolerate such mechanics in a game, yet for the filmic adaptation, I hoped that the helmers would possess the smarts to tone down the madness a tad, but alas, no dice.Hit-man comfortably transcends into the laughable when 47 manages to corner and best an assassin sent to kill him, yet rather than interrogate him (even if the chances of getting answers are slim), he simply riddles him with bullets, and then spouts a horrific one-liner. The manner in which he ends the assassin will cause many a cinemagoer to cringe.47 soon enough finds himself aboard a train, embroiled in a truly strange swordfight against a band of seeming clones. For good, politically correct measure, the filmmakers are even sure to throw a black ""clone"" into the mix, despite the fact that these agents are all meant to look like 47, if any consideration is to be taken in regard to source material continuity.Agent 47 is an inconsistent character to say the least  he, without hesitation, blows up an entire SWAT team, yet hesitates when faced with Inspector Whittier, someone who is a considerable threat to 47's freedom. Moreover, Nika appears to slowly melt his heart, and the accompanying scenes of levity just feel like an affront; a slap in the face to fans of the games.There is a shootout of considerable firepower about an hour into the film  it's hyperactive, it's loud, and it just doesn't feel very Hit-man at all. To top it all off, 47 even spouts another choice phrase before dropping the last goon in the room. The film's sort-of saving grace is its finale, where I had little idea quite what was going to happen. It's all appropriately tense, with the occasional wink and nod to the games, even if the action is far, far too frenzied.Even fans of the games will be left scratching their heads at the sheer absurdity of the film's ending  there is the high possibility of a sequel, although I hope this is not the case. Hit-man is a generic action thriller with a tiresome, clichéd plot and Russian accents that are even worse. Olyphant was completely miscast, and the only tolerable performance in this film was by Dougray Scott, who, frankly, shouldn't be appearing in films such as this anyway.",Hitman

I thought there will be awesome gunfights with superior accuracy delivered from a stone-faced sociopath. A ruthless, merciless killer. But what did they serve me? A friggin' baby-face wussyass gunslinger who feels sorry for hookers? He constantly holds back from shooting enemies at the first sight (hes elite killer enemies do also the same all the time) and there is no balls in this movie. Nothing. Just plain everyday shooting bad guys and using bond-gizmos. They had a good concept and they somehow just blew it. Utterly ridiculous and gray action movie. Olyphant is the silliest ûberkiller ever.This movie isn't exactly worth one star, but I have to drag it a bit down because it really does not deserve 6.4 star.",Hitman
139,Kroshe,Nice movie with good acting from Olyphant,10,1 March 2008,"Although a predictable storyline and sometimes unclear events, I liked this movie. I think Xavier Gens did a very good job with this one.This film surprises with narrative and visual style, and the charismatic Olyphant as Agent 47. Olyphant has a decidedly dark air about him, and wisely underplays the role. He is definitely a very talented actor and he is really good in this movie; I found him very believable. In my humble opinion, his acting is fantastically improved since Rock Star (2001). I also liked the parts where you watch him walking in the corridors just like in the game. He even walks like the game character. Excellent.I usually do not like adaptation movies. But this one worth watching whether you have or have not played the games. It really surprised me.",Hitman
140,rt-ingram,From a reviewer who hasn't played the games and didn't enjoy the film,4,8 August 2016,"Most people who enjoyed Hit-man are those who haven't played the games, whereas those who have didn't enjoy the film. We are all entitled to our own opinion. However, I haven't played the Hit-man games, and I didn't enjoy the film.The film is another of those action movies with a plot so illogical it hurts your head trying to work out what's going on. The main story is that Agent 47 has set up on a mission, but why? Why do the other hit men want him dead? And if 47 is seen as a ghost, why have Interpol been chasing after him for so long? The film tries many twists and turns but doesn't provide any real answers, and ends up being a confused mess.Another of the film's faults is that it's all told in flashback. After 5 minutes in, we are then told that all upcoming events happened three months before. So any possible dramatic tension has been thrown out the window.So overall, Hit-man is another video game to film adaptation with an incoherent story that lets you down. If I had a go at playing the games, I think I'd be more entertained.",Hitman
141,JW-30,style lacking story,6,28 December 2007,"The styling is good, the camera reflects the games atmosphere. Many peculiarities of Agent 47 are there, both to be recognized and in their place. In relation to the female protagonist, 47 is still the one we know (phew!). The casting is adequate, and Olyphant is a good Agent 47. Shooting, fighting, blood, explosions, sinister and scheming baddies with armed henchmen - it's all there.Yet, something is lacking.The plot is not complex enough to make the twists interesting, and not simple enough to provide the (mindless but fun) entertainment a action/war B-movie does. The action scenes are good, but at the ""quite-good-but-not-perfect"" level french movies unfortunately often stop at. The last unarmed fight was edited with those extremely short cuts, which usually indicate the actual action was too bad to be shown unedited. Bit of an anticlimax, that.It is a hard task to make a movie when the mental picture of the game is the measure against which viewers compare the movie. In this task, ""Hit-man"" succeeds - but fails in other departments.I recommend this movie for fans of the Hit-man game series, and people who need to kill time ... with a coin and crossed akimbo pistols.",Hitman

I guess I should go Enjoy playing the Game now.Honest to Buddha, I spent the whole movie asking ""Where was Billy Zane while they were filming this?"" Sorry, but Timothy Olyphant (who is not from Middle-Earth) was just too sickly and awkward for the role of Agent 47. He's done great work in stuff like ""Live Free or Die Hard"" and ""Deadwood"" where he's a no-nonsense bad-ass; but this emotional-awakening character was a little over his head.""Hitman"" is forgettable crap. I mean it; it's like a trailer - good, maybe, but insubstantial by itself. No one does anything worth watching in this. The action sequences are phoned-in, the plot is derivative, and despite the cover I didn't see Billy Zane anywhere... Maybe that's because I fell asleep.You'll find ""Hitman"" is the rubbish bin of Terrible. It's not even ""such a wreck, it's funny"" - it's just worthless.Still I got to learn more about Billy Zane ""j Did you know he was in ""Back to the Future"" - I and II? They were his first roles.

144,jim-j-moore,Enjoyable game-to-movie action romp,8,17 February 2008,"Viewers unfamiliar with the video game won't be disappointed - this is a well rounded action movie in its own right. Those who have played the video games from which the film characters are derived should enjoy the way Olyphant brings the anti-hero to life on the big screen.In places the movie skirts on the borders of the usual action movie clichés: our ice-cold protagonist appears to thaw due to good-hearted ""victim of society"" hooker, for example. However, this is reasonably well handled in this movie and thankfully we don't get a serving of love interest cheese.Dougray Scott's detective in pursuit character is another overused ""good cop against the establishment"" device, although again this is handled in a way that doesn't unduly distract. The fact that Dougray repeatedly pulls out a cigarette that he never once lights does become slightly distracting. If Dougray is an ardent non-smoker, why bother with the cigarette prop at all? Hard cops don't have to be smokers.As with all movies of this genre, realism gives way to visual impact. If it bothers you that someone can emerge victorious but unscathed from a 10-against-1 firefight, this may not be the movie for you.

I wouldn't argue that it's good, but it's not bad. My first complaint was Olyphant as 47. He just looked really nerdy with a bald head, but as the movie went on he grew on me. The movie was not deeply sophisticated, which could have done better for it. It was just a bunch of mediocre spy slash hit-man type stuff. He killed some people, then the other people talked a lot. It kind of felt rushed at times, and the whole thing together is kind of a mess, the movie doesn't come together as a whole, and that really bothers me.The only real good thing I can say about this movie is the romantic scenes. They were great, you really get to see these two characters fall in love, better than a different action movie where the characters have no chemistry. The scenes were well written and though the movie was quick the main thing you really got out of it was this little love story.",Hitman

Timothy Olyphant does well in the lead role as Agent 47, one deadly geezer and Olga Kurylenko is just beauty to behold as the troubled damsel in distress. The shoot-ups and fight scenes are fast-paced and thrilling. Well choreographed mayhem. Overall for fans of the game and fans of violent action this is a must.

147,dokha,This movie had potential to be something bigger but didn't want to.,6,30 January 2012,"Hit-man is based on a game, but that is not an excuse for the movie's very weak story foundation.i honestly there could be a part 1 of the movie because that would explain a lot. i found it more entertaining to stop asking questions in the plot and just enjoy it. my opinion is that movie could have been much better if enough effort was exerted in explaining the story line, complex events happen throughout the movie around the main plot line and the movie wasn't able to handle that a decent movie would be able to (which lessens its value), things just happened which probably was put there to make the movie look bigger and more epic than it really is so either make the movie simple (by removing all the extra fluff that really the producer failed to put any effort in explaining it from ground up), so i can fully understand it and thats what should have happened, because it already has a flimsy story base. or make it much bigger and longer so that it would be a real ""A"" movie not just another forgotten action flick, i felt they filmed a bunch of scenes put them together and called it a movie and not much thinking was made behind the scenes. shame because i think it is worth putting the extra effort in because how cool the movie was and how it captured the Hit-man essence, so if the movie was given to the right directors/producers i think would have made a huge difference. so its a movie that u would remember a while after watching, not the story but the characters. the following may not seem in relation but the scene where 47 kills belecof's brother; if you ever played Bad Boys II on PC the final scene is strikingly similar its not even funny, i had deja-vu.",Hitman

It was actually quite a good movie. It may not win an Oscar or anything, but it's amazing to see Agent 47 up on the big screen. Timothy Olyphant does a surprisingly good job of portraying him too.The love interest is a bit awkward to anyone who knows Agent 47's nearly complete lack of emotion in that department, but despite what the trailer may lead you to expect, it really doesn't go very far outside of what you've come to know in the games (and what happens when she tries to seduce him is absolutely hilarious and very much in the Agent 47 tradition).It is indeed a violent movie, and 47 is as cold-blooded as you'd expect him to be. Seeing it tends to make me wish other movie heroes had the same level of guts, just to shoot the bad guy in the face instead of letting him live or anything silly like that. The fight scenes with the other assassins from the Agency are also very well done and quite a treat to see.All in all, it's quite a good movie. Definitely worth paying to see in the theaters. Hopefully there'll be another one!",Hitman
149,FiveHundredFlicks,"It's a hit, man !",6,2 March 2008,"I played the Hit-man game to death when it was released in (checks) 2000 - some eight years ago. Eight ? Blimey. Anyway, as I recall, the game was a hit, very playable. Cut to St. Petersburg 2008: 47 has been fleshed out in 3D. As a game Hit-man had a limited lifespan as far as playability was concerned. As a movie I suspect that the franchise will run for 2 or 3 movies and I think it has the legs to go the distance. It's not Bond, it's not Bourne but it's definitely not bogus.There are some features carried over from the game which stand out as anomalies when transposed to film. The bar code tattoo for one, and there are some 'chinny reckon' moments when the disbelief you're expected to suspend goes a bit far but, hey, it's a movie and a half decent one at that.Timothy Olyphant seemed a bit stiff at first but I figured that his 'motivation' for his character was derived from a 2D character in a game. edit: The fight scenes, as with a lot of movies recently, are spot on. Olyphant and his opponents are choreographed well enough to make it work. For me.Olga Kurylenko is beautiful and she can act. Hell, she can act like a chicken or roll of carpet .. I don't care, she's gorgeous.The rest of the cast held it together admirably. There can't be a member of the cast who's not watched Bond or Bourne so treading between those two 'franchises' (I hate that term) can't have been easy.

The soft-spoken super cool Olyphant delivers the magic blend of cool, fear, confidence, and even delivers mechanically if it enhances the effect of the moment, which it does. The hot chick is involved in two very underrated movies. This and 'Centurion'. It's like Jason Bourne, but it's not Jason but you will put it on pause if you need to go to the bathroom.

152,movieman430,"It's fun, just go with it.",7,23 November 2007,"Okay before we begin, let's take a look at the title of the film in question: Hit-man. Not only that, but the T is created by pressing two handguns together upside down. Okay, now we know what kind of film we're dealing with. Hit-man is a strange kind of film. It seemed to pop up around the end of the summer with it's teaser trailer and then stay below most people's radar, with the exception being fans of the game. Then in popped up again with a full blown trailer and then two weeks later it was released. This is the approach of a studio that doesn't exactly believe in it's product. However, Hit-man isn't actually all that bad. While not breaking or even bending the rules, the action is load, violent, and stylish. Some of the movies strongest moments are when the hit-man, Agent 47 (Olyphant) is doing his thing, staying one step ahead of the game before the action explodes onto the screen. The plot is a bit convoluted, but it was bound to be. 47 is hired to assassinate Mikhail Belicoff, a Russian politician running for reelection. His problems begin when the man he killed holds a press conference showing him to be simply grazed by the bullet. Judging by the ample amounts of blood used in the assassination scene, he didn't miss. From there 47 finds himself running for his life from Russian goons as well as people from his own organization. And along the way of course he find the hooker with a heart of gold, Nika (Olga Kurylenko). The plot is linear and not complicated. The film carried a serious, but not too serious, tone. Moments of levity surround 47 and his awkward sexual frustration; we see him reading articles about what women want, and he has some humorous back and forths with Nika. However, we all know that Nika's really purpose in this film is to wear a very revealing dress, and then take it off. In the end, Hit-man manages to be a decent action flick, perhaps even slightly above average. I disagree with most people and think that Olyphant did a fine job playing the hit-man. Would Vin Diesel have been a better choice? Maybe, but not necessarily; Olyphant's mild mannered disposition carries the tone of the film very well. So, will it win any Oscars... no. Will we ever be talking about the cinematic significance of Hit-man... no. Will I buy it on DVD... probably.",Hitman

I like the games, but im not a big fan of them. My favorite Hit-man game is Hit-man Contracts. I guess Timothy Olyphant was an alright Hit-man AKA Agent 47. Everyone in the movie were not very good actors anyway, but some parts had some good acting. The movie was kind of hard to follow, and know what's going on. It really jumps all over the place, it goes to istanbul, Russia, nigeria, all that stuff. It goes everywhere, its like they end up in one spot and go to the next, like they are hopping from country to country in seconds. And that stuff with the bald headed clones in the movie was a little confusing, and everywhere agent 47 goes, he is always grabbing a gun out of something, he grabs a gun out of ice bins, toilets, etc. Where do all he guns come from? Also, there is not really any background about 47's past, how he became a hit-man and all that, and his organization. Some of it had some pretty good action, some of it had some weak ones. Some of it is just the hit-man going around and shooting people, but there are action scenes. There is a sword fight scene that is not all that great. Pretty much the best action scenes, is the scene where the agent 47 meets a weapons arms dealer, and 47 mows a lot of guys down with two machine guns, and the arms dealer try's to shoot 47 with two M60 machine guns in both hands, people do that everyday. And there's an action scene near the end of the movie that is kind of cool, where a helicopter try's to kill 47, and a fight scene, and mowing down more guys. There is also a hotel chase scene that is okay. Some explosions were okay. The violence was pretty bloody, but not really gory. But some of it was not too bloody. Who know's, maybe it was a little toned down, you never know, but we'll see if there is an Unrated DVD.I thought the stuff between 47 and Olga Kurylenko was alright, Olga Kurylenko is pretty hot.

157,dickklip,"Starts great, then fades",6,28 March 2010,"I was intrigued by this movie, having seen the trailers when it first came out. At first, I thought it was a futuristic Sci-Fi movie, but other than the shaved heads with UPC bars on them, it seems to take place in the present.The plot is essentially simple: a hit-man (Timothy Olyphant) from the organization that apparently raises children to be hit men after shaving their heads and tattooing UPCs on them, has an assignment to kill the Russian President. He supposedly makes the kill, but the Russian president turns up alive on a newscast. How can this be? As he tries to unravel this mystery, and make sure that he completes his assignment, he is pursued by the Russians, Interpol, and then, totally inexplicably, his own family of trained assassins. Why? We don't find out anymore about that than the reason for the shaved head and bar code.Along the way, he meets a mysterious and beautiful woman, whom he mistreats so badly that of course she falls in love with him, although he has virtually no personality. There's plenty of action along the way. I watched this on TV from my DVR, in two segments. After the first hour, although I didn't understand it completely, I was lauding the film due to the fast pace and action sequences. After the second hour, it was like ho-hum, big deal, as the bad guys are dealt with and the ending sets up for a sequel. I understand that this is from a ""graphic novel"" (what we used to call 'comic books'), and you probably have to read them to understand what's really going on. As for me, there were more questions than answers, starting with: why wouldn't these ""hitmen"" grow their hair out to hide their bar code and blend in? They're pretty easy to identify otherwise. And if you're trying to lay low, and commit these crimes, don't you want to be incognito? Anyway, I'd say this movie is slightly more good than bad, do to the pacing and action, so if you have an extra two hours of your life to give, it's worth a watch.

The film's storyline is a somewhat weak point, with no elaboration into the the main characters past or any real back story whatsoever. What the films lacks in story, it makes up for in action packed sequences. This film has plenty of action, from gun fights to sword duels to jumping out of high buildings. Acting is okay, nothing real special. Gore and blood is a big part of the movie as well, with many scenes of people being shot and blood splattering all over the place, particularly later in the film.

The casting and acting was decent, the action was usually well directed (except for the shakycam in a few fights) and it was just fun and majority of the assassination and action scenes looked like something that could be done in the games.What prevents it from being truly great is the studio interference. Xander originally wanted to do an R rated movie but the studio fired him several weeks before release to reshoot or reedit a few scenes to secure a PG13 rating plus they changed 47's backstory and lazily inserted scenes from another Fox show into the title sequence and I am not a huge fan of those changes.

If you are looking for a proper hitman game where 47 approaches a mission silent assassin style with ave maria playing in the background then you should look elsewhere.With that out of the way Hitman is an alright action movie, you won't remember it in ten years but there are worse ways to spend an evening. The cast does a good job overall. The plot is serviceable and allows our superduper assassins to shine by putting him in a number of difficult situation. The two main leads worked well together and there were some chemistry between them.What stops it from being more than an average action movie then? Well the villain is not that memorable and they story is not that good. There are also few action scenes with anything close to any emotional impact, there are a lot of shooting and explosions but there are no scenes i will look up on youtube in the future.I think that the movie would have benefited if they borrowed a bit more of the class and dignity from the game. At times they try to portray the main character as a slow and methodical but that character is quickly thrown out of the window and replaced with an acrobatic ninja instead who dodges bullets with ease.I still enjoyed it for what it was, which is an average action movie.

162,rchosen,Worth seeing if you enjoy the game!,9,21 November 2007,"Well I love Hit-man. Own every game. Spent thousands of hours playing them every way possible! I even dress up as Agent 4y every Halloween. So naturally I had to see the movie. But unlike most people who want to see the ""game to movies"" I don't expect the movie to be 100% accurate.First I'll comment in its accuracy. 47 would never have sympathy for anything, although he did have a bird in the game it appears he ""liked"". So maybe its possible. But the girl in this movie he was suppose to kill and he didn't, he always kills his targets.Second the beginning was crappy. 47 is a clone. They are not orphans and what not raised to be killers. And on one scene you see one of them is black. Nothing racist but all the clones are exactly the same and white. How can A clone be black? But like all things made to a movie they have to keep it more open to a broader spectrum.Lastly there a few minors things that didn't really bug me but 47 wouldn't do like talk so much, get caught...be on camera, move the way this guy did...etc. Nothing major.As for the rest of the movie it was great! The blood was the right amount, the action was perfect and even the story felt like the Hit-man style. I like the scenes that are just like in the game like the rubber ducky and what not. Some people didn't like nudity because there wasn't any in the game. The game isn't for kids anyways. Its a dark game about a dark subject.The actors were all great and pulled it off well although I didn't care much for the guy playing 47. His voice was awkward and face was a little weird. Maybe I am to use to him in Live Free or Die Hard.",Hitman
163,quadbastard,"Not entirely a bad action thriller, but ultimately a missed opportunity.",5,25 April 2008,"From the first five-ten minutes of watching Hit-man you find the production smacks of a low-budget film festival movie which is emblazoned with the 20th Century Fox stamp of approval.So, from that you know the movie is going to be short on Hollywood style razzle dazzles, but of course when the film cannot rely upon saturating the viewer with visual grandeur, the narrative aspect must be especially strong, and able to draw the audience in at some kind of intelligent middle ground. Unfortunately, Hit-man (mostly) falls short even on this count.Much of the film deals with its political conspiracies with extended dialogues which are often very disinteresting, and the Interpol agent on the trail of the title protagonist doesn't seem to have any genuine motivation about apprehending him. But the movie does have some positive aspects, Olyphant is actually quite good as the enigmatic assassin Agent 47, and probably was a more sensible choice than the early rumoured Diesel, who could hardly be called inconspicuous.The movie does have some bursts of action in fits and starts, which are rather exciting and well staged - a scene featuring Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond, Lost) as a Rasputin-Esq looking gun smuggler in a heated shootout (with definite John Woo chic) in a bistro setting is really cool to watch. The direction by the young Frenchman Gens is certainly competent and even borderline stylish at times, and notably respects the source material. Probably a low point about the movie is the film makers deciding upon playing up the love noir relationship between 47 and a prostitute played by Kurylenko, which is given a much bigger focus than it should have. As for Doom (2005) you will find some special nods to the video games, e.g. some teens playing Hit-man BloodMoney on a PS-2, and fans will instantly recognise some of the scenes have been shot in the identical style of the third-person viewpoints employed in the games.With Hit-man I felt Director Gens had some reasonable ideas, but over indulged in sentimentality with the quasi love story prominently taking a centre stage. He had such a great character with so much potential for making a stellar movie, but squanders the vast pool of material by drawing from one of the most minor recurring theme in the game series. It was like ""Right. I have the Hit-man license, but now I don't know exactly what to do with him"".In closing, I strongly recommend instead you watch 'The Day of the Jackal' (1973) which is a brilliant masterful thriller, and most likely was among the major influences for the original Hit-man Codename 47 game.",Hitman

It has guns, blood, and an extremely hot supporting actress... what else do we need from an action film as men?!?!? Nothing! I enjoyed it thoroughly. It had plenty of action sequences, many of which were straight from the game. A couple plot twists, and Nika is BEYOND gorgeous. Unfortunately the plot twists were pretty confusing, and poorly executed. But then again, I give them props for even having plot twists. The acting was good, I enjoyed the sound track. I also liked the ending (haven't seen the alternate ending yet). I actually ended up buying it, and seeing as I'm a student with not much spare money, that says a bit about the movie. Now obviously, its not a ""must have"" movie, but it is definitely worth watching, just not with your kids, lots of blood.",Hitman
166,rachel-673-19946,Timothy Olyphant. As an assassin. What more do you want?,7,27 April 2012,"Despite not really having been much of a gamer in the past – though PORTAL 2, and the interactive Military SF novel that is MASS EFFECT are changing all that now – I have always reserved a special place in my heart for movies based on videogames. From STREET FIGHTER to DOA, and from WING COMMANDER to my beloved SUPER MARIO BROS., the scripting gymnastics through which the production team must jump to make their First Person Shooter or Action Adventure Game into a viable feature film are ever-entertaining, and the simplistic nature of their fundamental premises (Bad guys are coming! Let's kill 'em!) at least takes all that pesky thinking out of the movie-watching equation.Of all the many video game-based adaptations I have seen, however (TOMB RAIDER! DOOM! PRINCE OF PERSIA! TEKKEN!), Hit-man is the only one that I would never have guessed was based on a video game at all, because it transcends the usual nonsense of such endeavors and crosses over into being, simply and without question, an actual good movie.Admittedly, when the story kicks off it's all worrisomely familiar, and therefore might lead one to be somewhat trepidatious about what is to come. We get montage-y vision of a cadre of bald, barcoded, presumably genetically-modified youngsters being raised in an institution, dressed alike and taught elaborate fighting techniques—so far, so DARK ANGEL.(Indeed – and this is almost incredible – the footage is actually FROM DARK ANGEL, which the end credits acknowledge; who says people don't recycle enough nowadays?) But instead of staging a mass breakout during a nationwide EMP and leading to Jessica Alba in leather, it transpires that the bald kids raised in this particular evil college of combat all become elite assassins, stalking their terrible away across the world with shiny guns in hand, taking out high priority targets and living lives of dysfunctional loneliness.One such assassin is Agent 47 (Timothy Olyphant – and, yes, okay, I'll acknowledge that this is probably why I like the movie so much), a particularly adept killer who has, for some reason, been set up by his own people to take the fall on a particularly politically-motivated assassination. Why his agency would allow one of their top operatives, in whom they have presumably invested much time and money, to be sacrificed in this manner is never sufficiently explained, but the upshot of it is that we are therefore treated to action-packed assassin-on-the-run crazy fun times, with 47 making a new friend/hostage in the incredibly gorgeous person of the troublesome Nika (Olga Kurylenko) while trying to avoid his fellow assassins and the relentless Interpol agent (Dougray Scott) who has been hot on his trail for several years. (Long enough that he has developed a grudging respect for him, in the way that all fictional manhunters seem to do for their quarries.)Meanwhile, 47 is out for vengeance on the man who caused him to be set up, and in the process of developing feelings for Nika – chivalrously unconsummated feelings, by the by, which, if nothing else, makes this movie unique in its handling of the necessary Love Interest stakes – he declares war on anyone who would harm her, as well. It's all very sweet, in a brutal and callous kind of way. There is really no other way to describe it.Not having played the game, I am in no position to comment on this adaptation's authenticity, but as something of a connoisseur of a) action movies and b) the work of Timothy Olyphant, let me just say that I consider this to be the most successful attempt to bring the two together that we have yet seen (not that LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD didn't have its moments). Of course, this movie is far from perfect, even leaving aside any gamer gripes – I especially found it odd that this phalanx of distinctively groomed and tattooed assassins has gone unnoticed and unapprehended all this time, given how much they stand out in the crowd. Then again, they're basically The Observers from FRINGE with guns and weirdly conspicuous ink, and we all know those time traveling guys managed to elude detection for centuries. So maybe people are just dumb. But for all its flaws, of Olyphant I have only praise, and Kurylenko – wow. Elsewhere, Dougray Scott is dapper and determined, bringing the ease and aplomb to his obsessive inspector that is pretty much his hallmark.All in all, you should definitely include Hit-man in your next video game movie marathon, or action movie marathon, or assassin movie marathon – or, indeed, Timothy Olyphant movie marathon. Unless I'm the only one who does those?– This review first appeared in Geek Speak Magazine",Hitman
167,inc-10,"Tiny sparks of potential, but still everything wasted",3,23 December 2007,"Huh, I don't know where to start. First, those who are against comparing movie to game series, I disagree. A movie based on a game, and so good game in fact, HAS to stick with the game. There's no excuse for what movie script did to the original game idea, simply because game is better in all ways. It would be reasonable to make changes in movie so it would be better, but this time (well, as always), every change made movie worse.The way movie is presented is strange. Some points, there's simply chat. Just some boring, meaningless dialogues, worse than your casual soap opera - because they don't have any plot-important content. Then, empty footage, like someone walking. Or hit-man sniping. And then, unreasonable action. Whole movie is built using these three parts and every one of them isn't too good. Ah, and the fourth element is rare but nice humor relief moments. Like hit-man saying something funny or commanding prostitute into car trunk.Timothy Olyphant really tries at some point. And it's nice to see, I even managed to forget that he looks like 15-year old at some moment. But awful, abysmal script doesn't leave him much to save: Hit-man in this movie smiles, cracks jokes, continuously fails to pull the trigger...I have no clue why Russia and Russians were chosen for main location and folk for this movie. Throughout the movie, there was 2 lines of believable Russian language, apart from that, Russians in cinema needed to read English subtitles to understand what the hell was just said. I still haven't figured out WHY movie makers won't hire anyone who actually COULD speak Russians, and shoot the director into feet if he decides to actually screen something so unbelievably bad as Russian in this movie was. Did Americans really bought it as true Russian language? How many Russians live in US? Isn't there fluent speakers to hire?There's also no believable connections in plot: FSB majors DO not let any Interpol commissars in their way. FSB special force troops are NOT clueless rookies as seen in this movie. And they definitely don't wear prototypes of US Future Warrior combat gear. And CIA won't never ever simply ambush anyone in the middle of big Russian city street. This all was so utterly, painfully stupid. The plot was as loose as something could be. But the worst part was where 4 assassins met: Dual machetes? It was like watching Xena: The warrior Princess, or something even more idiotic... To sum it up, No stealth was in this movie. No real hit-man. No understandable plot, and bad acting in most parts. Before going to see it, I knew that I don't want to see this, but as a fan of the game, I have to. I still regret this.Humorous ""Leon the Professional"" did everything right. This movie got it all wrong. Go see ""Leon"" and skip this terrible waste of license.",Hitman
168,miketigas25,Satisfied - See it.,8,28 November 2007,"If you haver ever played the game before, you are aware that there are two ways to play the game. One is to be a psychopath (in other words, kill everyone and not only your 'target). The other is to be a silent assassin (simply said, you don't kill anyone else EXCEPT your target). The latter part is what makes the game really fun and interesting. You enter the place, sedate enemies from behind, get their clothes, sneak in, kill your target and leave before anyone sees the body. Of course it's hard. But that's the point of the game now is it.And that's my ONLY complaint from the movie. No silent assassin-type scenes. Surely, it's obvious why: there's only one target. I guess a possible part two could dish out this very simple request.Generally though, I was very satisfied by the outcome of the film. Most scenes were very reminiscent of the game. Special thanks on the part of the crew for ACTUALLY playing the game and sticking to it; not like some adaptations (*cough* Resident Evil *cough*). I have nothing against Timothy. He did an amazing job playing the great 47 (though, physically, he didn't). I hope they make a second installment.Oh, and another thing, if you've never played the games before nor have you seen it, then don't worry. Just enjoy the action and the sexy scenes (READ: sexy not sex).",Hitman
169,olesd,"Not a hit, but not entirely a miss either",7,16 October 2008,"This film is actually a great video game adaptation. It's a fine combination of fan service in the form of in-jokes, and actual investigation of the concepts and characters behind the game. There is so much attention to detail at times in this film that the scenes look exactly like live action versions of screen shots from the game. The acting is fine, the action is fun (and surprisingly realistic and visceral), but several things do sink the reputation of this film, perhaps unfairly. The writing is not incredible. At times it rings authentic to the location and the 'spy' feel of the film, but at others the jokes are corny, the one-liners out of place, and profanity is gratuitous to the point of being ridiculous. Timothy Oliphant is a bad choice to play 47. He's WAY too young to emulate the deep voiced, grizzled killer from the game, but the character he plays is not a non-entity. He plays the Hit-man in this film much like Lincoln from The Island; as a child who has had little experience in the world. This makes the film feel like a prequel to the game series, which perhaps was what was intended. This is why he acts more emotional then his later incarnation, which has been mischaracterized in reviews as a departure from the character. I have never seen a more faithful adaptation. The look and feel of certain sequences is straight from the game which is more then practically any adaptation film can say. Hit-man uses every tool and weapon from the game in this film, and some in ways unexpected. The camera angles, lighting, and direction is spot on, and even the music reminded me of the series. This was a fun, not too pretentious, lavish, unique, and overall entertaining film. Compared to a lot of movies that seem made to annoy, bore, or disgust people, Hit-man set out to entertain, and for me it succeed. This is a movie to enjoy, and that's so rare I appreciate the privilege!",Hitman

The simplicity of the title promises nothing more and nothing less than a complete meal for action movie addicts. I figured it would have a shallow but still touching emotional side to it to add a color other than blood red to the movie. But all in all, I expected to see my all-time favorite action scenes with gunshots deafening me, blood spurting everywhere, screams and music with a metallic maddening ring to it. I was not disappointed. People who expect more than this should give up their hopes. Hit-man is all about the pure beauty of senseless action and catchy lines. Not to mention that my like for Timothy Olyphant from his previous appearances raised the score. There was inevitably the feeling of discontent for me as a Bulgarian, because the movie, mainly shot at my country, presented Russia.

172,jgibbon08,A flaming bag of crap,2,11 May 2008,"'Hitman' confirms that decent video game adaptations are not possible. The action, though at times mildly entertaining, is extremely brainless and unimaginative. The camera looks as though it was handled by a six-year-old. We often get shots from the ground while people are talking when we should have close up head shots. The plot is very confusing and it is doubtful that even the writers knew what was going on. The acting is extremely wooden, as if the actors read their lines from cue cards. Even Timothy Olyphant, as the bald and sleek assassin only known as Agent 47, is awful, which is surprising given his above average performances in 'Live Free or Die Hard' and 'The Girl Next Door'. Hopefully he can bounce back from this. He might as well leave it out of his resume.",Hitman

A heartless killer who gets payed to kill people and escape without leaving a trace? SweetBut in there lies the problem with this movie. The Hit-man movie doesn't quite depict the same person as the game, this Hit-man has a heart and the other doesn't. The are some scenes where he could just kill the person and he doesn't and then he starts liking the girl? What kind of Hit-man is that? It's quite disappointing (I do understand that this types of movie sell better, but...)As for the movie, it's just another Rambo/Die Hard kind of movie, where a real badass just starts killing everyone and no one can't even hit him with a punch. Don't get me wrong I'm all pro action movies, but this is just too much.The acting is not all bad, but some scenes you can see them just standing around waiting to die, why don't they move? Are they bad actors? Or no one told them to try and save themselves, it would made the scenes more believable.Also just because a guy has Russian accent doesn't make us believe that he is Russian. These guys have Russian accents but say sentences with words I didn't even knew existed.All things considered if you are home alone in a Sunday afternoon, the rain is pouring outside and the movie is on the TV or just sitting on top of your DVD Player then you should put it on, otherwise save yourself time and money.",Hitman

But even 47 couldn't anticipate a ""random equation"" in his life exactitude: the unexpected stirrings of his conscience and the unfamiliar emotions aroused in him by a mysterious Russian woman.To start off, the movie looks great. From all the locales, camera angles, costumes, the production values are mind-blowing and give it the high-budget vivid look. If you are a gamer, you may already know the origins of 47, and you should really know it, because the movie doesn't elaborate on 47's background.Why is this a great movie? Because it does what all video game movies in the past had missed - have a plot which matters. Though it might be a bit confusing, this is actually a well-structured plot line. As far as acting goes, many gamers had criticized choice of Timothy Olymphant as 47, but he does full justice to his role, thankfully. Rest of the cast does a great job too.On the flip-side, the only negative points of this movie can be that it lacks stealth action from the games, which might disappoint some gamers, and some of the movie looks similar to the Bourne movies in terms of music and some locales, but Bourne movies are amazing so no complain there.Overall, this is a must see for the gamer, and also a great action movie people should check out, regardless of what critics think of it.",Hitman

So, a hit-man who supposed to blend with the crowd so nobody will notice him, shaves his head and wears expensive suits, of course who will notice someone like that. They should have got Adam Sandler for the role. If you are going to make a believable film, then try and get the character right. But studios don't like that.

In the movie however, it wasn't quite like that. There was too much romance and sweetness in this movie. This movie was made to make a lot of money, not to be any good. No one basically died in this movie but some soldiers and some guards. The movie is called ""Hitman"" and no one dies in the movie... To think about it now, I have to knock off another rating point.

I'm a 19 year old female who owns the 2nd Hit-man game and never played the first one. I was really, really hoping they wouldn't screw up. My fiancé didn't have high hopes for this. I loved, looooooved how they evolved 47 over the time of the film. I couldn't imagine Timothy Olyphant doing this role any justice. But he and I were both FLOORED at the acting in this. Olyphant was stone cold when he needed to be, and when he had his softer moments, he didn't over-do it, he was subtle about it. As he was growing feelings for her, he still stayed true to his job and himself. He didn't kiss her, he didn't have sex with her (in fact, just the opposite- he friggin tranquilized her. Lmfao :-P) And for the actress who played Nika, I was surprised. I had NO idea who she was (still don't), so I had no expectations for this role. She was great. And yes, she does have a fairly nice body Lol :-P She was the yin to his yang, the cream to his coffee, and vice versa. They had some GREAT moments, very funny actually :-D And Dougray Scott, I liked seeing him in this type of role. As for following the game, I'd say the team did spectacular :-D. The camera angles, the sniper scenes, and the action sequences actually BLEW us away :-) When he escapes the hotel room towards the beginning, so cool :-) We both LOVED the train scene, where kicked like four other agents' asses. I wonder if Olyphant did all of the fight scenes himself? I think one of our other fav scenes was towards the end, when he kills Mikhail Belicoff (I think that's the guy?) in the tower, and he lives through it by ducking beneath a table. 47's caught by Mike Whittier, and the guy from the restaurant where Nika hands him the folders across the table winds up helping 47 escape Whittier. Amazing :-D. But we both were falling outta our chairs when he crashes through a window in the hotel, and there's a man and woman PLAYING Hit-man on the TV. Lmfao :-P. That was sheer brilliance :-D.This is prob the best game-to-silver-screen adaptation. My fiancé didn't like the game very much, and he looooved it. I'm a fan of the games, and I loooooved it :-D We can't wait to snatch this bad boy up- we'll be fighting over for it for at least a month, guarantee it :-P And now if you'll excuse me, I gotta go find the first Hit-man to purchase and play it :-D.PS- IF, and I do mean if they make the 2nd and/or third into a movie, they'd have to keep Olyphant as 47.

As far as the visual side goes, it's not bad and Timothy Olyphant is pretty competent in his role, but the screenplay I mentioned was utterly BUTCHERED. To make things worse, a couple of good scenes were re-shot as annoying, pointless waste of film tape, the storyline was mangled to be barely understandable and to top it all off, someone hammered footage from ""Dark Angel"" in to confuse viewers even further. Traces of the original screenplay can be found, with changed locales and characters, but they're irreversibly damaged by the unacceptable changes forced by the producers.The worst thing: there is no ""director's cut"" version.

Ruthless, determined, subtle, deadly, and a total badass, he also injected a necessary touch of humor and humanity to the character. My hat's off to everyone involved in making this highly entertaining film that not only pays great tribute to the game series, but also serves up a darned fun action film.

I have been a huge fan of the games since Hit-man: Codename 47 came out for the PC years ago. I don't have any idea how this piece of crap made it past the guys at IOI. When the Hit-man series came out, it had a bit less of a story line than the Trix rabbit but it evolved into a great story, and backstory. Here's my problem...Movie: Agent 47 is played by Timothy Olyphant who is a horrible actor to begin with. He was actually so bad of an actor, in fact, that the director didn't even try to have him use a British accent. Games: Agent 47 is modelled from and even uses the voice of David Bateson who would have been better for the role in the movie anyway.Movie: Agent 47, and all of his so called ""brothers"" were orphans trained by ""The Organization"" or whatever unoriginal name they called it. Games: Agent 47 and all of his brothers were clones who looked exctly alike (which means no black agents for example, sorry). They were cloned and trained by Dr. Ort-Meyer, some of them escaped, and even fewer went to work for the Agency or the ICA.Movie: Agent 47 is seen shaving in the bathroom. Games: AGENT 47 DOESN'T NEED TO SHAVE! He was cloned without hair so as not to leave evidence at crime scenes.Movie: Agent 47 is almost seduced by Nika but eventually develops a soft spot for her. Games: Agent 47 would have first killed her dead rather than to let her whore about on top of him.Movie: Agent 47 pulls out katana swords from his back pockets that he had supposedly been carrying around with him the entire movie. Games: Agent 47's only weapons are two Hardballers, his fiber wire, and his syringes...never have I seen him conceal ninja swords just in case he runs into a group of people who want to kill him on a train.I just hate everything about this movie. It could have been great! The games are far too dark for the way they took this movie. They ruined games that had an excellent storyline. Finally, I always said that Michael Fassbender would have been a much better 47 and Paul Verhoeven would have been a much better director.",Hitman
188,doktorwho,"Completly illogical and incoherent, but funny...",3,26 December 2017,"Movies based on computer games are generally bad, so I didn't have any illusion when I decided to watch Hitman. 
Watching the movie was amusing , but I'm chocked that so many on IMDB gave this movie such good reviews. their are some good things about this movie. The actions scenes were competent enough, even entertaining at time as long as you don't think too much about the context around it. The ""Bond girl"" of this movie , a Mila Kunis look-alike who wear as little as possible, is obviously easy on the eye even if she couldn't act to save her life.Unfortunately, the movie is trying way too hard to remain faithful to the game. The bar code in the back of the head of the assassins is one example, it looks cool in the game but in the movie it just looks ridiculous . In many scene they tried to reenact agent 47 the way you see him often in the game , 3 person view which doesn't really make sense in the movie. He also put on costumes when it's not really necessary , another mechanic from the game which they kind of forced into the scenes of this movie. I am also surprised of how powerful the Interpol organisation is in this movie, the policemen looking for agent 47 literally go around and boss around the authorities in Russia. In the end they even show up in force to arrest the alleged killer of the Russian president, and the whole police apparatus in Moscow is okay with that , what the hell?Does the director of the movie really expect us to believe the Russians would let any agency , let alone Interpol, a organization with no real power or authority, order the police and the FSB around(todays equivalent of KGB) with impunity?The plot in itself is overcomplicated and illogical even by gaming standards, why do the Russian opposition hire Agent 47 to kill the ""moderate"" president when they obviously control most of the security forces in the country. Can't they do the dirty deed themselves, the Spestnatz was on vacation or something?Why the stupid ""switcharoo"" to replace the nice president with an evil double in full public view which sound difficult and unpractical? Just kill the guy and blame the terrorists, and place your own hawkish canditate in power. Russians in movies aren't exactly known for their subtility. Agent 47 , himself the main protagonist , is badly played by an actor who tries his best to give a vibe of mystery and deadly efficiency but only manage to appear stiff and honestly rather stupid. He also really stand out in a crowed, a tall bald guy with a bright red tie in a suit. That works in a computer game, but in spy-movie it doesn't. He was much better in doing action scenes than dialogues which he thankfully had few of.The female protagonist falls in love with him in about 3 minutes , even though Agent 47 threaten her, lock her up in the trunk of a car (with a dead guy) for no reason, and basically put her life in great danger during the whole movie. Must be the worse case of Stockholm Syndrome I've experienced in a movie, however she was a little better at acting than her counterpart and looked positively hot when she didn't talk.All in all, an incredible mediocre movie , even for something inspirated by a computer game, as a spy movie, it's just ridiculous. Only view for the laughs.Drinking game suggestion for this movie : drink a shot every time the Interpol detective call Agent 47 for ""our boy"" or ""our guy"" . Drink two shots every-time a Russian officer/policeman cower in fear when a foreign agent tell them they have jurisdiction.",Hitman
189,twsegreto,Excellent,8,21 November 2007,"As we are all well aware of most film adaptations of video games are usually very poor. This is not the case with Hit-man. Hit-man has done something that no other video game film has been able to pull off before. It is entertaining to the general audience who has not plaid the video game, by use of witty remarks, dark humor, and excellent action scenes. On the other hand fans of the video game series will be pleasantly surprised that Hollywood has not butchered the concept of the video games. There has been much debate over the actor who played 47; all actors did an excellent job. I was very pleased.Bottom line: If you enjoy the video games  see it. If you don't know anything about the video games but want to see a movie similar to Bourn Identity then see it.",Hitman

What I really liked about this film was that it stuck to the game in a lot of areas. Not like what they did with the Resident Evil series. A lot of Agent 47 characteristics from the game were in the film and how they kept the wardrobe of 47 in the movie was cool. The film's score was also surprisingly good. I thought it would have been some white rock band music though out the whole movie, but it was well done and stuck to the theme/tone of the movie. Timothy Olyphant did a great job getting into this character. It was also cool how he sacrificed his head of hair for the role of Agent 47. Olga Kurylenko did great as the damsel in distress, but she was strong in a way too. The relationship between the two was very cool. In all Hit-man is a entertaining movie, action movie, mystery, and emotional movie. If you like the game you'll love the movie. And if you like the movie you'll like the game. 9/10.",Hitman

We really thought about playing it twice. The action, and the blood, and the gore, and the pretty sexy starlet make this great fun to watch. But, the seriousness of the ""hit-man"" and the way he stayed in character made this an even better film. The locations were European and a very good travelogue. There was enough logical sense to the movie to keep you rooting for one side or the other, so it kept you watching until those action and nude treats came in. The contest between those hunting the hit-man, and the hit-man's earnestness in pursuing his target kept the movie on track. And then the action made it engrossing to watch.",Hitman

May be it would have fit for a production made for the TV only.The actors were average or below, the sword fight looked ""artificial"", the rest not to mention.The best scene in my opinion when the Russian helicopter shot the tower of the church to kill Agent-47.Save your money, or spend it for another movie instead.",Hitman

Why is she in this movie? Oh, right, to humanize the lead, then to act as tepid love interest, and finally to be captured by the bad guys so the hero can rescue her. She's not an actual person, she's a walking plot contrivance.Most disappointing, though: the action scenes are unrealistic and stylized-- which is perfectly fine, as a kung fu fan I actually prefer ridiculous fight choreography-- but it's not quite over-the-top enough to be really stand-out as anything special or memorable.",Hitman
196,Gravesofthetrust,Unsatisfying action and a largely incoherent story makes this a movie not worth watching,4,27 November 2007,"A disturbing trend that seems to have no end in sight is the constant making of movies based upon video games. The fact of the matter is that these movies largely end up being horrendous misinterpretations of the source material. As evidenced by such cinematic horror shows like the Resident Evil movies, Street Fighter, Super Mario Brothers, Tomb Raider, and every movie by Uwe Boll. Of course there is the occasional movie that proves the maxim wrong, I for one enjoyed the Final Fantasy movie: The Spirits Within. Granted it had next to nothing to do with the game series apart from the name, but I was able to enjoy it. There was also the Silent Hill movie, that was great due to the fact that it was able to maintain a majority of the atmosphere from the games, and the plot was largely consistent with the mythos of the Silent Hill series. Unfortunately the latest movie to try to adapt a video game has largely failed to take even the smallest modicum of what made the games enjoyable.Hit-man, a movie based on a good action series, isn't exactly a bad movie. If you go into the movie without having played the games by IO Interactive, then you'll in all likelihood be entertained by the action this movie has to offer. Fans of the games however will most likely be left feeling cheated by the movie, and it's radical changing of the main character of the series. In the movie it explains that 47 and the other bald headed assassins were chosen at birth to become guinea pigs of a top-secret plot to breed trained killers who feel no remorse. Now if this reminds you of anything, you're a nerd, and yes it's totally ripping off part of the plot for the old TV show: Dark Angel. I don't mean to go all nerdy video game fan boy on you, but, in the games 47 wasn't chosen at birth to become the bad ass assassin he is today. He's a clone of four major criminals and a scientist to make a flawless human. Not once in the entire series of games do they state whether or not 47 has a childhood. If they had felt the need to do an origin story for 47, why not just base it off the story elements of the original Hit-man: Codename 47 game? And throw in bits of the missions from Contracts.Before I continue on with the review I would like to state the fact that this movie was written by Skip Woods. The man that brought us the terrible movie Swordfish. While I had nothing overly against that film, it bears mention due to the fact that at times the plot of that movie was positively horrid, and as such Woods needs to be beaten with an oar.The movie starts out with an Interpol agent returning to his home, 47 is there sitting in his chair. Aiming his gun at fearless Dougray Scott. The movie then keenly informs us that the bulk of the story takes place three months prior to this scene. 47 has been hired to take out the Russian prime minister Mikhail Belicoff. The hit goes off with seemingly no problem, but Diana, 47's handler for the Agency (called ""The Organization"" in this) informs him that there's a witness he needs to eliminate. The witness, Nika is played by the wonderful Olga Kurylenko, when 47 goes to eliminate Nika another hit-man from Agency arrives to kill 47 and Nika. 47 escapes and confronts Diana about how Nika wasn't a witness, and whether or not someone at the agency double crossed him. While this is happening the Russian police is sending in its crack squad of cops who look like they were stolen from the anime Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade, to capture or kill 47. Dougray has a problem with this as he wants 47 alive for questioning, as he's wanted for multiple hundreds of murders across the globe. How he was to establish it was only 47, I'll never know.After a moderately decent action scene 47 kidnaps Nika and takes her to a St. Petersburg train station where he's attacked by a cadre of Agency trained hit men. The problem I have with this part is the fact that the assassins are fundamentally working toward the same goal, kill 47. At this point when 47 is outgunned by three other assassins, instead of just ventilating 47 they aim their guns at each other. At which point 47 proposes that they die with honor, and brandish some wakizashi swords and proceed to fight. The fight scene is decent enough, but it was just pointless. Where was 47 hiding those little buggers, and why didn't 47's would-be killers just kill him and then go knock off for a while at the nearest bar? I would go further into the plot, but really, I don't feel like spoiling it any more than I already have. Suffice to say that I didn't exactly enjoy the story to the movie. It took far too many liberties with the character of 47, and far too much of it seemed implausible from the perspective of realism. Also there's the questionable choice in casting Timothy Olyphant as the cold steely eyed assassin: Mr. 47. I don't hate the guy, it's just that I think he's a highly inappropriate choice. Granted he was a decent enough actor in that atrocious show Deadwood. He just looks too young, and not at all what a ruthless killer should look like.Overall the movie is a mediocre action film that people who've never played the games will most likely enjoy. Fans of the series however would probably hate it due to the large number of liberties they take with the character and source material. Overall the movie is not worth the time to watch it.",Hitman
197,zarrod,It takes a certain kind of audience...,6,13 June 2009,"Which suck more: videogames based on movies or movies based on videogames? Both are equally painful so I looked forward to Hit-man, another attempt to cash in on the success of two markets, like I look forward to getting garroted by a surprisingly conspicuous bald assassin. The movie is based on a series of video games in which the player takes control of the clone Agent 47, completes assassination after assassination, and gets rewarded for making it look like an accident and being stealthy. It did not differ greatly from my low expectations but Hollywood is smart enough to know that there are moviegoers who love this stuff. As the credits rolled and I sighed the contemptuous sigh of one who has lost hope in video game movies, my friend sitting next to me said, ""It's a pretty good movie."" As the film is made for gamers, it takes a specific audience to understand the source material. Having played, and even enjoyed, some of the games myself, I can understand where this film might disappoint or please fans of the games and it does a little of both. First, its level of violence and sex should be sufficient to sate the teenaged thirst. Sometimes studios worry about alienating too many potential viewers with an R-rating and make a movie for teenagers rated PG-13. These filmmakers were at least wise enough to know that if kids could find a way to play Mature-rated games, then they could easily find a way to see a movie intended for viewers 17 and older.Hit-man the movie stars Timothy Olyphant as the hit-man, but the actor is just too soft to be Agent 47. I kept remembering him as the nerdy bad guy from Live Free Or Die Hard when he's supposed to be a cold-blooded killer. The guy in the games is more badass, ruthless, efficient, and emotionless, which are seen as positive qualities in the gaming world, where attempts at including well-developed and emotional characters are frequently laughed off the market. He does a lot more hand to hand combat and blows away civilians without batting an eye. In the movie he has been made 'too human' to be respected by fans of the games.I don't remember the plot but I don't really care because I do remember that it wasn't worth remembering. There are a bunch of action scenes broken up by lame romance and scenes of a cop (Dougray Scott) trying to track the hit-man.There is also a ludicrous scene of sword fighting that has nothing to with anything and appears to be thrown in to hold the audience's attention. I found it amusing but I think some people may have found it engaging, like my aforementioned friend. Anyone who has ever played a shooter against people all over the world via Xbox Live knows how many idiotic gamers roam the world, spewing racial epithets, tea bagging noobs, and saluting dreadful films with respect. These people will appreciate the clichéd, stoic, but principled character of the hit-man, the repetitive shootouts, and the unnecessary nudity by Olga Kurylenko (actually, most males can appreciate this). Yet, I cannot be too hard on the movie because it includes a scene in which Olyphant (I can't really call him 47) breaks through a window and lands next to some teens who are startled to see a bald man that resembles the computer generated character on the TV in front of them. This scene told me that the movie was not taking itself too seriously and neither was I, so at least we were on the same page.",Hitman

199,nyFITguy,Mediocre Film,5,23 November 2007,"One of my favorite types of movies are the mindless shoot em' up films with just pointless blood and violence. Everything from Transporter to Rush Hour. They are just good fun and they don't need that much of a story or great character development for you to enjoy. Timothy Olyphant stars as Agen 47 in Hit-man about an orphan trained at this camp-like place, getting their heads shaved, and training to became a spy/assassin. Olyphant is hired to assassinate a political representative. The tables turn on Agent 47 as other assassins are out to kill him. He is on the run trying to figure out what's happening and not only that, but also protect a local prostitute on the way. Alright, so, this film's previews just looked good. I watched them and thought to myself wow this looks like a good mindless fun film. Didn't look that hard to follow. It was late at night and it was either this or American Gangster. I chose this one and regretted it. The film starts off OK in the first few minutes showing how Olyphant grew up and what training he encountered during his childhood. It starts off in present time and then takes the audience back three months telling the story. The film, in my opinion is just boring. It starts off slow, throwing a little fight scene in a hotel with Olyphant running around with guns shooting cops. This was OK, as were the other fight scenes. These fight scenes had lots of potential to be just awesome and in the end they just lack so much and the audience is just sighing because it's a waste. One scene jumped out and was cool and that involved other assassins in the fight. Other than that, nothing really caught my attention. Not only were the fight scenes lame, but the movie itself was just downright boring. I usually like character development and lots of dialogue, but with this type of film, i don't' think you need those things. The film drags on in parts, the dialogue and acting was dull. Olyphant delivers some top notch scenes and he did good for his characters, but some of his lines in the movie were just laughable. They were very wooden and so scripted, the audience in my theater just chuckled. The only time i can recall the audience in my theater being remotely excited during this film was when the female character bares all for the screen. That says a lot. Overall, the film is mediocre and had lots of potential to be a very cool action film. In the end, it's just boring and dull. The acting is fine and the casting was fine. Not really any A List actors or anything like that. With fight scenes that seemed half-assed and numerous scenes that just drag on, i would just recommend you rent other films like The Transporter 1 and 2 etc. Pretty much all the cool looking fight scenes from the previews is all you get. So enjoy from the previews, and use your money for other cool action films. But if you really want to see it go for it. I guess it's not the worst action film out there. Then again, it's not the best.Overall, 5/10",Hitman
200,Willemite,Game Over,3,30 November 2007,"I never played the game on which ""Hitman"" was based, so saw it purely as a film and not as an adaptation. The fun of noting game-film commonalities was lost to me. There were, however, elements of the film that I found creative and intriguing; the school for assassins, cloning in various forms, the grainy cinematography, current affairs in the former Soviet state. But instead of lifting the film above the genre, they reminded me of what a better film this might have been. Instead of a thoughtful look at technology, politics and humanity, with lots of kaboom, the best parts of this film served as window dressing to an adolescent blood-fest. I trust the gamers to comment on the range of weapons on display here. There were too many for me to track. I did not maintain a body count, but it was definitely way up there. And the mindless, Cylon-like military/police forces were such easy pickings for our hero that it was clear they were nothing more than point-of-view targets.We are supposed to feel some sort of affinity with the hero of a film. What guy did not see himself in fantasies as Bond, James Bond? But I found it hard to link up with 47. He was just too willing to wipe out whoever was in his gun-sights. Are we supposed to feel sympathy with him because he has no comfort level with the ladies? Grow up.If you like to see lots of weapons being used on lots of people, a wealth of things that go boom in the night, a bit of creative, Saw-like torture, and a near complete absence of real humanity, ""Hitman"" is the film for you.",Hitman
201,hiddenm,47 in the movie!!!!,10,26 January 2008,"First i got to say that i'm a huge fan of hit-man 47 games, so my opinion is based on how they managed to get the game in to the movie.Right from the beginning I knew they did good. Timothy Olyphant is a perfect choice for Agent 47. The camera works try to copy the view in the game and gives feeling of playing it not watching it. And as in the game every murder done by 47 is a part of a bigger plot. I've got to say, that my expectations were lower when i heard they are filming another movie based on a game. Usually they screw up and make a lower out of a merc or something like that. Here 47 is exactly like he should be. No feelings, no regrets, just trying to be human in some parts, but not always manage to be. He kills and has no remorse or feelings for his victims and here it's good..it's actually perfect.In the end i have to say, that for people who haven't heard of the game the actual rating is about 8 of 10-just a nice action flick.

202,blackangelproductions,"FINALLY, a good adaptation",7,9 December 2007,"this was a very good film compared to what i expected it to be. it was slick and had a good script without trying to get the audience to connect with the main character which is a good thing because there is not much to try to connect with in the games so the director did a good job of not trying too hard with a character that has virtually no past present or future. the acting was.......mostly good. performances from people such as Timothy Olyphant who played the infamous 47 did a pretty good job of staying pretty stoic without seeming wooden like a certain Austrian governor. there are some dodgy acting jobs in it but thankfully these are only minor characters so it doesn't take too much away from the whole film.i have a couple of criticisms though. one, there was a point in the film where he puts his back to the wall and stands as he does in the cover of one of the hit-man games which is really annoying and slightly too much. another criticism is that sometimes i got the impression that all the voice acting was done in a voice over and the sound guys couldn't properly sinc the audio and this caught my eye about 5 times in the film but i may just be paranoid. one last problem is the story, while it wasn't s@&#house, it tried to be slightly too clever with the whole theme of the president making doubles of himself and things like that happening but i didn't let that ruin my overall enjoyment of the film.point of this is, it is a good mindless film with some decent not-so-mindless elements to it. it even features a hot chick getting up in the morning and walking around with nothing on but a g-string. all ion all, if you enjoyed the Bourne films, you will enjoy this and even if you just like a good mindless action film, this is one of the best and o\if you are a fan of the games, go see it, its worth it.",Hitman
203,jekyllgrim,A very funny comedy,3,26 January 2009,"I never expected to see a good movie based on a video game and I wasn't surprised when I watched Hit-man. I should point out that for non-Russian person it's difficult to realize how ridiculous all it seems, because the number of various mistakes and nonsense episodes is immense. And that is especially vexing, as the original game never contained such mistakes and showed elements of other cultures precisely.I'm not going to describe all the differences between movie and game plot lines, the facts that in game all the hit men were clones, that clone 47 was one and only effective hit-man, that the place where hit men were created and grown and the place where they found their jobs were actually two separate independent organizations - these facts are not really important. The first and main problem was that the genre and style were chosen wrong. Authors tried to make a serious movie, and this resulted in a ridiculous movie. Hit-man should've been made in a way Tarantino's and Rodriguez' movies are made; stylish, effective and not serious - the way the game is.Because how can it possibly be serious? Really, a bald guy with with a bar code on the back of his head being a hiding professional? C'mon, guys, that makes me laugh. The movie should've been directed in a way that the spectators wouldn't think about, like they don't think how much blood there's in human body when they watch Kill Bill.Let alone that absurd representation of Russian reality which has nothing to do with the way it really is. Not at all.Of course the movie still could've been saved by a main character shown in a right way. It didn't happen. No, Olyphant really is a good actor, but what he plays has nothing to do with that cold, straightforward, self-assured, calm and elegant agent 47, a silent Grim Reaper itself, though not without a sense of mercy. And the scenario writers are to blame.On the whole I'd say that making such movies is just insulting. I won't say that, though, because it made me laugh. But that is not a good characteristic.",Hitman
204,two-cents-worth,Entertaining - It Gets Better With Repeat Viewing,7,26 February 2014,"If James Bond, at least Daniel Craig's version, had been reared by an assassin's guild, he would have been 'The Hit-man'.The plot of 'Hitman' is convoluted - quite a refreshing and enjoyable departure from the norm.The 'Hitman' character is also a departure as he is not the standard one dimensional homicidal lunatic. He was programmed from an early age to be an assassin and that is what he is. And, he is very good at his job.However, there are facets to his character that become increasingly inconsistent with that of a single minded killer. At the end of the film he asks his nemesis Micheal Whittier, an Interpol agent, 'Can a good man kill'? In other words, he develops a social conscience.The film is fast paced, smooth and stylish. And there is violence. However it is not the endless gratuitous violence of a Tarantino film but rather it is an integral element of the story line.Timothy Olyphant does a great job of portraying the emotionless, nearly robotic killer evolving and adjusting incrementally to his human side.It is a movie that gets better and better with each viewing.",Hitman

The action scenes and the suspense in this movie were impeccable. I was indeed very impressed. But to top it all, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the US was not portrayed as the evil empire.

The only thing I have against the film was that it was a little dull and awkward in the beginning, but it picked up about 15 minutes in and kept it rollin' until the ending.

210,tobypang9394,An average video game adaption,7,11 May 2008,"As a fans to the game, I expected to see a 47 with emotion and thoughts, and more about his introspective story in silence killer and contracts, where he tried to escape from his killing life but again forced to be a killer again.The movie did quite well on making 47 a real person, i understand that some fans here want to see the 47 exactly the same as he was in the video game, but i prefer a more emotional 47, because i want to see how this born killer thinks. 47 is as smart as he was in the game, able to dodge all the dangerous in a flash, he moves exactly like he was in the game. Timophy Olyphant did a quite good job prostrating 47 as a highly-intelligent and tough killer, and the emotional aspect, the painful memory of early days and affection to the girl was well performed too, but still i think he looks too young for 47, 47 started his first mission at about 40 years old! Some of the action scene are nice reproduction of similar scenes in the video game, leaving a bomb in the hostage's throat except for the udre belicoff ambush, if this mission is played in the game, 47 wouldn't have start shooting in front of everyone. The last fighting scene far from satisfactory though, i can see the pictures are fast-forwarded, probably because Olyphant can not do the actions fast, i don't mind seeing a stunt double, but fast forwarded action scene really bothers.One disappointment for me is that the movie didn't adopt the clone killer idea, which to me it's the most compelling part of the hit-man story, instead they just reconstructed the facts in the game series, the agency became the organization training orphans into killers, differed from the freelance killer agency in the game.There is one question left unanswered in the movie, how did 47 obtained the key to the last bishop's personal chamber? I hope there will be a sequel in the future, or ""i'll find vin diesel and burn the building around him to the ground""",Hitman
211,wunderwhirl,Good movie but mildly let down,6,23 November 2007,"Hit-man is one of my favorite games of all time. I loved its story and its strategy, its very addictive. Needless to say when i saw the previews for the movie version i was way excited. This movie would of been an excellent movie IF it didn't have the Hit-man game legacy to follow, but since it did, it let down in a few ways.First: The jumping plot that at times was a bit hard to follow or decide what was going on. The plot didn't jump so bad that it was impossible to watch but it did jump scenes regularly making it a little confusing. There were a few characters that i had trouble figuring out why they were there, and this happened all through the movie. Id have to say the plot could of been developed a little better than it was, and some the characters could of been made less flimsy and more explained. Second: Agent 47. He seemed to have a uncharacteristic soft spot. I cant see the video game character having that. Again, if this movie HADN'T been connected to the video game, that softness towards the girl would of been acceptable.However, I did think there were some pretty decent fight scenes in the movie. Also a small detail i noticed an liked is how the director filmed Agent 47 walking, back towards the camera. He filmed it high, as if in video game view, just like the game. Its a movie i walked away not feeling totally satisfied, but not completely let downOverall, i give this movie 6 out of 10 mostly because of the reasons stated above. Unless you're gung ho about seeing movies IN the theater, id just wait to rent this on DVD. Good rainy day popcorn rental.",Hitman
212,lawer2,Potboiler,2,23 February 2008,"The really great! ...potboiler. The director seems to consider the audience of this masterpiece ecstatic dummies. There are a lot of imbecility in the movie, I'll mention just some of. First, only an idiot can take Sofia for SPb - they are as much alike as, e.g., Paris and Athens. So called ""Russian special service"" guys have a magnificent writing on their cloths: ""ФϽБ"". LOL - there are no letter ""Ͻ"" (I don't even know how to call it) in Russian. ФСБ (Federal Sequrity Service) guys never wear such uniform as in the movie. The same about ""Russian soldiers's"" uniform - ravings of a madman. Maybe it was a nightmare when someone saw these cloths? But unconditionally and undoubtedly the King of Imbecility is the episode with Belikov, when the writing ""Народен Театър Иван Вазов"" on the pediment of the building is widely shown :0)))) The writing is in Bulgarian. OK, I can understand one hasn't money to make his movie in SPb. He even can show central square in Sofia-""SPb""(who cares?). But writing in Bulgarian (who cares - anyway dummies don't understand Cyrillic letters) is just the sign of the director's deep disrespect for his potboiler audience. By the way, an example for English speakers: imagine you saw ""London"" or ""New York"" in a movie, and, for instance, a building was in that ""London"", and a writing (in clear English) ""Dem Deutschen Volke"" was on that building.PS. I saw the dubbed version, but those who saw the original say ""Russians"" in the movie speak Russian with awful accent and with gross spelling mistakes.The only reason to see this movie is to LOL.

I think the writers went on strike a little early. No plot twists, no good action sequences, nothing good.Honestly if you are dying to see this movie either get a bootleg copy or just wait till it's on Spike late night.If i had actually spent 10.75 to go see this movie, i would have demanded my money back.",Hitman

217,python-c,"For fans of Hit-man, an excellent film",8,18 April 2008,"I don't get it. Just like the prequel Star Wars films, Hit-man: The Movie is receiving negative reviews that make no sense to me.Most movies based on video games don't even reach the threshold that this movie surpassed by far. Xavier Gens has birthed an amazing action film, characterised by quick, intense action scenes and an enjoyable soundtrack by Geoff Zanelli. The acting is above par, from Timothy Olyphant as Agent 47 to Dougray Scott as the persistent Interpol detective on 47's case. I for one didn't expect Olyphant to do anywhere near as well as he did. He gave a mysterious yet likable personality to 47, and managed to be badass at the same time. While I was disappointed by the lack of stealth action in the film, I did enjoy the guns-blazing fury that took its place.This film wasn't perfect, mind you. Again, Gens seemed to miss the entire point of Hit-man, excluding any form of stealth action. And I thought the fact that Fox decided to replace the concept of 47 being one of several hit-man clones with one of him being an orphan trained since birth upset me, especially because I realised they were just trying to be politically correct.Thankfully, those negatives are almost completely overshadowed by the excellent plot and enthralling action. It was great to see Agent 47 brought to the big screen, and I sincerely hope Gens considers making a sequel. One tip: Keep Olyphant as 47. That guy did a great job.If you liked the Hit-man games, or action films in general, check this one out.",Hitman
218,akg-subs,Loses it after first 30 minutes,5,6 September 2010,"This movie starts with a lot of potential of being a fast-paced political thriller, but it all wears away as soon as the sole female character is introduced into the storyline. From thereon, the movie loses its firm grip on nicely advancing plot as well as the central theme of the storyline.In a typical Hollywood fashion, the girl tags along with our lead character on his murderous adventures, and escapes unhurt each time amidst bullets and swords flying in all directions. Just what purpose this girl serves in making the movie more interesting is beyond my comprehension, except providing a visual feast for the horny minds by flashing her tits and butt a few times on the screen. It would have been more realistic if our lead character, who has been trained to be a nameless cold-blooded assassin since his childhood, had put a bullet in her brain as soon as her purpose was served. But the unfortunate killer becomes instead her protector, perhaps giving in to the call of his horizontal zones. Pathetically, even that aspect remains unfulfilled till the end. Oh, how lame!Directorial work is uneven and at best, average. No effort has been expended in character or plot development. Action sequences are B-grade, and are composed of large number of short takes, highlighting director's limited ability to capture fight scenes neatly. Background score is pretty average too, and one gets a feeling it has been used countless times in other B-grade action flicks. The only thing that stands out is the camera work, which, though inconsistent, is very good in some sequences.Acting effort is pretty average as well. Olyphant does not impress when delivering punch lines. However, when silent, his presence is decent. Rest of the actors have done an unremarkable job.All in all, an average movie. Don't waste your time watching this. Read some book instead.",Hitman

I love to watch it multiple times and every time, I become a bigger fan. There are non-compliant stuff like ""47 showing too much of chocolaty emotions"" throughout the movie, but I liked the change anyway! I always wondered how it would be if 47 ever ""met"" a girl.

220,vaguekiller,The studio destroyed the movie,7,5 June 2021,"This movie is one of the few that could have come close to its adaptation. The studio wanted a PG movie from a very violent and mature video game, we all know how will it turn to be. They just wanted the ""title"", so they can squeeze the money out of it. These studios don't care for story or characters of the source, they just want money. They don't care what the director says because they want a film which is enjoyed by audience of all ages even if the source material don't agree, so that they can make more money. If the director doesn't go along with this, he will be replaced (especially if not famous) or edit the film as they wish.This movie could have been a faithful adaptation of the source, we can see it from the characters. The director made a genuine attempt to make the characters as close as the source material. Most of the scenes from the movies are actually from the game (if you had played it), but not necessarily in order, even the rubber duck. The director tried to be faithful to the source material but the studio doesn't allowed him to be. Most scenes were re-shoot and re-edited, especially the train station fight, to fit into PG audience. The movie was supposed to have a sequel (as it was directed) in which the origins of 47 to be told, but what the studio did was ""copy-pasted"" ""Dark Angel"" which told the same story, to the opening credits of the movie (saving money) and the dialogue ""the organisation didn't gave us names, but number"". See how quickly a back story is finished, which clearly is incomplete for those who don't know the source material. What most of us do when a film doesn't live up to expectation is to blame the director, but the invisible hands behind the curtain are the studios.The extreme cases of this type can be seen in Netflix adaptation. This has to be stopped.",Hitman

222,XtremeKiller,Amuseing action,7,29 February 2008,"To start with, the opening scene where you get to know, how Agent 47 became who he is, it's exactly what you want to know. Not to much of it, like Spider-Man, and not to poco, like Bourne identity. But to the rest of the film.. where the heck is the story!? Agent 47 get a mission, that he completes, and then they're trying to kill him. Okey?Not much to ad about the story, more than it was just to weak and didn't got much of character.But the characters, wou baby, here we got the movie! First out, T-Bag aka. Robert Knepper, as some Russian federal agent. And realized pretty soon something.. Keep up the good work in prison break! Cause like Russian, he ain't very good.. at all.. When he tries to talk with the Russian accent, I don't get any feelings at all. He just sounds clumsy and like a new beginner. And he often slip over to his T-bag accent.. Why do they put him in this Russian part? Peter Stormare would have been the perfect actor for this part I think.And Dougray Scott, as the American fed. Still remember him as Sean Ambrose in MI2. And this time, reflect to the MI2-time, he does it really good! The little story about him and Agent 47 isn't very interesting, but through the film, you just got to enjoy his character and his hunt after ""my man"".Timothy Olyphant or Vin Diesel? I placed that question for my self, some months ago. And after I viewed this, Timothy Olyphant is the only correct answer. He is just terrific as the Agent 47 character. Is cold, when it comes to everything. And the director do some great work here, with not destroying the Hit-man, and make him to some sloppy James Bond-fool. He is just correct, and so cool to much.And Olga Kurylenko! Where the heck did they got her from? I haven't heard anything about her, and now BANG! Hit-man. BANG AGAIN! She's in the next Bond movie! Who is she? She's a very interesting actress, and she does a great job with her hooker alter-ego. She likes Agent 47, and she got a great body and some nice moves to offer him, and she knows it. The relation between Agent 47 and Nika is what really get this movie up till 7. And the fact that they didn't have sex, however she really turns you on, more than so many other movies with faint sex-scenes. Cred to Olga!7/10, this is a entertaining peace of creation.

It is not supposed to be Rambo 5. It is a movie about a skilled professional assassin, who is capable of sneaking in heavily fortified locations in various disguise and kill his target without any collateral damage. The highest mark you can get in the game is Silent Assassin rating - and this is only achievable when there is only 1 death - the target's.Either way, this movie has a lot of cool actions, although the gun massacres and the totally idiotic blade fight in the train totally spoil any realism.It could have been great; well thought, well planned movie, but instead they choose to make it a poor imitation of Matrix / Rambo.",Hitman

Except the title and the fact that the main actor is bald, this movie has no similarities with the original concept. So, that mean that this is just a story about some assassin. Well, it is a very bad story. The main problem is of course script. Things happen in this movie without reason. The main characters move around a lot, but there is no solid explanation why. It's all based on the fact that everybody is after assassin and where he goes, everybody goes. There is no tension and the action is generally dull. The assassin ain't cool at all, he's just angry for some sort of a reason, which we of course don't know. Maybe, we even know, but we don't care.To conclude, this movie has nothing to do with the games, and as the action movie alone, 99% of the people will forget it very very fast.",Hitman

A hit-man movie SHOULD be great but the director plays with the camera in such a way that you never ever get to see what is going on.

I will admit I've never heard of Timothy Olyphant before this movie and to BE honest I sincerely hope his other work is miles better than this. As the lead in this movie you would expect he would pull off something deserving that position but alas this is not the case. He moves around like he is being controlled by extremely bad puppeteers for most of the film and dare me to say this but his performance is more wooden than a two by four in a vice submerged in a bath of quick drying cement.

With so many advances in American cinema dealing with detailed martial arts, extravagant ""shoot 'em up"" scenes, and incredible chase scenes it seems almost frustrating that a bad ass like Agent 47 stars in a movie that is far behind its time. There were no great martial arts (or hand-to-hand) fighting scenes, no great kill scenes, no great chase scenes, no great one liners, no great explosions, etc. If you decide to watch this movie for the story then at least you get a linear story that adequately explains the background of the character yet avoids the fall of an origin story for a character many have never heard of. If you decide to watch the movie for the acting try something else: not consistently bad enough to take you out of the movie completely but still bad enough that you are not ""trapped"" in the movie.If you are just looking for hot chicks, yeah, Olga Kurylenko is extremely attractive but I am sure you can oogle over her pictures on the internet or watch another movie she is in. Plus, the nude scenes are short and not as prevalent as some reviewers at this site have led you to believe.

The makers of these movies just haven't been able to find the right balance of staying faithful to the game, having an intelligible story (for it's often the case that the games don't) and finding the right actors to fill their shoes. Hit-man seems to have ticked all three boxes to some extent.The story is fairly easy to follow if not a little rushed, and given the game's virtual lack of story- line they don't need to worry for that aspect, and Timothy Olyphant does a good job of portraying 47.

Hit-man hit the mark perfectly by blending the video game's complex and lengthy story, into a movie (which seemed toned down in violence.) There are a few things of note, which if you are a fan of the series, you may want to keep an eye out for. First, there is a bit of a love complimenting the story, which seems completely out of the ordinary for 47. Also, the man that created 47 was not part of ""The Agency"" (not ""The Organization"" it is called in the movie.) The first was done to add more depth to the 47 character, which I understand. If you've played Silent Assassin then those scenes match the intensity of seeing the thugs kill the priest. The second was more of a side mention, which is the tell tale sign of not correctly using the material already set for them.The good news is, that many of the game's locales and missions were alluded to at some point in the movie. As well, the guy playing 47 did a decent job.

Everything about it was un-remarkable - acting, soundtrack, filming locations, storyline/plot, cgi, etc...I felt slightly patronised as the film failed miserably to be intelligent and stylish. It is actually just random gunfights, dumb scenes and stupid character actions. Characters were un-inspiring and the film has a 'rushed filming schedule' sense to it. I ended up yawning thru most of the film.Yeah OK its mindless violence, but a film has to do better than that these days and this just comes across as capitalising on a popular brand and as a platform for c-rate actors. There is certainly no atmosphere or tension and this film failed to excite me. TBH i thought it looked a bit crap when i saw the trailer. I've heard good things about the Hit-man games and I can imagine that the people who made the game would have desired a much better film than this. They should of had a greater say in the film development.",Hitman

It's the only game I can pick up and play at any time, even if I haven't played it in months. I was overjoyed, and a bit worried, when I heard that they were making a Hit-man film. I saw it Thanksgiving day, the day after it's release, and I am back to the 'overjoyed' portion of my thoughts.The movie follows the game almost exactly, aside from the clone/orphan thing, but it's not anything to lose sleep over. I was blown away by the execution of the Price target at the fancy restaurant and how close it was to a possible in-game scenario. The movie continues the action from one end to the other and, thankfully, they didn't try to make it into a love story, (THANK YOU!!).Hopefully, a sequel or two will come of this and we'll see where it goes. All in all, it was a great movie for fans of the game, or for fans of shoot-em-up style movies in general.",Hitman

There was a plot in this movie? Unbelievably BAD STORYTELLING.Anyways, the movie just disrespects the game all the way. Original 47 was cold. And anyone who has played the game since its first release knows this. In the movie, you see a bald kid waving guns and trying to look scary while 'saving' a hooker from a 'baaad bad wolf'. Come on Hollywood.. Why do you think people don't BUY DVDs and movies? Because you make this kind of sh*t-for-a-movie.

There was very little action and I did not understand the story at all. All of the best parts were in the trailer. TImothy Olyphant was not bad choice to play Agent 47, but what happened to Vin Diesel, I think he would have rocked...This movie should have been action packed and there were maybe three action scenes.

Even though, he points a gun in her face. Don't be dramatic that this movie didn't make any money in the box office or that there are some new actors in Hit-man.

A few other minor things are true to the games also.Where the film goes so wrong is the nature of Agent 47. True fans of the game will know 47 does not kill everyone in sight. In fact, at least in the first game, 47 will be terminated by the agency if he kills too many.Nor does 47 master karate and ninja-style hand-to-hand battles. He is a deadly killer, but not superhuman John Woo style or the son of Rambo.The worst part for me was when CIA actually rescued 47 from Interpol. I am not sure if the film would like 47 to look like an American action hero or what just happened there. 47 does not respond to CIA - only the agency. Though the agency in some matters work with CIA (among many others) it is only for the benefit of the agency - not the cooperative organization.The movie is a classic ""movie made from a game"" installment: It fails in most parts and would have been better without any reference at all to the game.Oh, and the part where he jumps into an apartment where two kids are playing the Hit-man game on their console: Please, don't do such things.",Hitman

He just ""is"".*The film leaves you hanging at certain points trying to figure out ""why""? Why did Agent 47 do **** or why ***? (as in the case of the bathroom killing and Diana), but you figure it out after a short wait (except for Diana).*Sympathy for Agent 47 is semi-earned. There's no background story, just an assumption of the past, however, you do get to like him.*CIA connection ruined it. Preferred private company with no U.S. affiliation, especially government affiliation. However, it's such a small, small part (maybe 1 minute worth), it's easily forgotten.*Not sure why the girl was even part of the movie (apart from the obvious - there HAS to be a ""love interest"" in every Hollywood movie that's not a war movie) except to give Agent 47 a reason to kill people.Good enough to add to a DVD collection.",Hitman

Timothy Olyphant gives the best performance of his career so far as ""AGENT 47"".When I first got this film, I thought it was going to be another pointless hit-man kill kill kill type of film.

And since I am probably one of the few people that DO NOT like the video game ""Hit-man"", the movie adaptation was...well I didn't expect much anyway. The thing that scratched really painful my nerves was the fact that the movie was filming MOSTLY IN BULGARIA. No, NOT IN Russia! In BULGARIA. In 90% of the movie I kept seeing our streets, our homes, our people. But of course who really cares, anyway? Hit-man plead to be filmed in Russia. Everybody is speaking in bad-Russian and what about Bulgaria? You guess right - nothing! I'm not that American-type-of-person who says ""Our country is great! We love it here!"". On the contrary - my country is full of crap thanks to our great leaders. But still... How long are we going to be unknown for the rest of the world? I hardly doubt that anyone of the people, writing and reading in IMDb know where Bulgaria is. And that's a pity. As long as the movies who has been filmed here cover the true filming location and the people in this country and claimed to be Russian property - nobody will know it.

However, the actual movie is quite the contrary.The camera work and direction remind me a little of Ultraviolet, with really quick shots, and random, not too well put together scenes that are either confusing, or too quick to the point.Essentially, there is little dramatic pause throughout the entire movie. I really like Timothy Olyphant, but the writing and direction really hurt his acting.You never really feel what the main character is feeling and when they try to insert elements of drama, it just feels cheesy.Most of the acting is sub par and really reflects B movie style.It was as if the fight scenes were written first and then they molded a storyline around the fights.I'd wait for the DVD with this one. The action is OK, but, there's no feeling behind it. You don't necessarily care if he kills the badguys all the time, because the writing doesn't allow you to identify with any of the characters.However, I like Timothy Olyphant, and for that I'll rate this movie 6/10.",Hitman

Hit-man ""Blood Money"" or even ""Contracts"" has far better scenery and action,I understand that movie can't offer ""multiple choices each second"" environment that we expect from the game, but have expected it to be less predictable so that audience wouldn't feel so bored.IOW, punchline of the movie should be really good dynamic story instead of pretentious grimasses, GFX and quite average if not poor choreography etc.",Hitman

252,Braxus,A complete failure,3,19 January 2008,"Let's face it, the hit-man video game was not very good. Decent, but by no means a classic. This distinguishes hit-man in my opinion from most other video game adaptations, where the video game template usually was a very good one (maybe with the exception of some games that were turned into Uwe Boll movies). In many cases, a great video game was turned into a mediocre movie. So what quality of movie can we except from a movie that is based on a mediocre video game? In Hit-man's case, a mediocre movie at best.Basically Hit-man is an action-oriented conspiracy thriller. The main character appears to be heavily inspired by Kurt Russell's Character in ""Soldier"". Which is okay. The other characters, well, are somewhat dull adaptations of the cast from a James Bond movie.As is the script. Which is also something I don't bother about when watching video game adaptations. What I found remarkable was that the dramaturgy of the movie somewhat also leans towards that of a video game. The whole story appears very fragmentary and episode-like. I don't know if that was intended, but I didn't like it.Usually video game turned movies have their most shining moments in the action scenes. The hit-man game did not have a lot of action, since most of the time you were busy with planning things and sneaking around. Consequently the movie also has a rather slow pace with comparatively few action sequences.To sum things up, Hit-man fails both in the story and the action department. In principle, this is still nothing to bother about, if you are expecting to watch a B-movie. Unfortunately, Hit-man can offer none of the things that usually make a B-movie so entertaining, like over the top violence, cheesy one-liners and political incorrectness. This movie is just way too serious and polished to be entertaining anymore.",Hitman

With this, no knowledge is required whatsoever of the Hit-man games. We just get thrown into the story with the brief over title look at a hit-man and how he grows up. The story flies along being clever but not too clever for its own good with great action pieces and faultless acting from the main cast who perfectly fit into their roles. This film wont change the world, but it doesn't set out to. This film will keep you entertained, gripped to the viewing matter and doesn't take the mickey out of the viewer.

And above all, he never kills anybody that doesn't pose a direct danger to himself or is ""innocent"" which was a really important aspect of the games.Just a couple of minor stuff that weren't perfect and considering the not-so-famous levels of the actors didn't make this a 10/10 movie, but it's as good as it gets.By all means, this is NOT a deep, though inducing movie with magnificent acting to deserve a very high rating, but if you played and loved the Hit-man games, you'll absolutely LOVE the movie and nothing will disappoint you.47 rocks.",Hitman

What with recent game adaptations such as Resident Evil or Doom destroying the story and premise of some great games. However Hit-man really surprised me.At first I wasn't sure about Olyphant as 47. I have played one of the games and his facial features don't match the character all too well. However after watching this film I was sold! Olyphant is 47! He has the character down pat. The walk, the personality, the killing! His walk was what got me, it was like watching a real life version of the game.The story was good, it wasn't anything special but there were a few little twists and turns that kept it interesting. There are no spoilers in this so I wont go into detail except to say that as long as you don't go into Hit-man expecting an Oscar winning story you wont be disappointed.The action and fight scenes are nicely done and there is enough blood to keep gore and splatter-fest nuts at bay but not so much as to deter people of an opposite stance. There are some big explosions and slick gun play which should delight.As most people have mentioned, and I guess I should too because what would a big action movie be without an attractive female getting her kit off? Well obviously some people have forgotten about this vital ingredient in action these days. I am glad to say that the action movie of the 80's has been brought back somewhat with the female lead in Hit-man. It has been too long! All in all, Hit-man was a very enjoyable movie on its own. There are many references to the game, clothing changes, hidden weapons, syringes full of blue liquid, and the most blatant reference of all which I wont spoil for you (you will see it when you see it). The adaptation from game to movie is done very well and should please. Fans of action/conspiracy movies and fans of the Eidos games will most likely enjoy this film. Don't expect fantastic performances all round (bar Olyphant) or an award winning story, but do expect a delicious array of blood, baddies, bullets, boobs and bar codes.",Hitman

The action sequences were all excellent, and yes the hot girl nudes up! A nice surprise is to actually see some humour in the movie.

260,TheBrokenHearted,Failed Mission or Successful Hit?,6,2 December 2007,"With the Hit-man movie, yet another game franchise is taken to the big screen. First of all, don't expect to get a movie rating of 8/10. This isn't Academy Award winning material. This was most likely created for the sole purpose of entertaining people on a Saturday evening with a bucket of popcorn jammed in between your legs and a coke in your hand. First 'dissappointment' (depends on the viewer) was the casting of Timothy Olyfant as the notorious Agent 47. Even though Olyfant is an upcoming actor with an impressive filmography (Die Hard 4.O, Deadwood,...), he just isn't '47-material'. Those who have played the game know that 47 is portrayed as a man of few words. A man who goes in, does his thing, and disappears. Most of the time without any human contact. 47 also has a strong, dominant face. Olyfant, unfortunately, is more of a baby-face. Remember Scream 2? Nice performance as the twisted movie-freak who turns psycho. But still, baby-face. Which is probably why I laughed every single second of the Scream 2 finale. First choice was Vin Diesel. Although the man can act, still, bad choice. Casting Vin would result in a stupid xXx-clone, or even worse; A Man Apart! Even though after reading this, you would expect the worst, guess again. Olyfant's baby-face turned gritty dark. His performance however, remains to be seen. Of course it's not my job to tell you whether or not you should see this movie. That's for you to find out. Like the games? Go on then, go see the movie. But in my opinion, the movie does not honor the games. The Agency for which 47 works, is almost completely left out. The only function the girl seems to have is to show her breasts every now and then and to show that she never wears a bra. The shadow-like killing style of the game is almost completely abandoned. In the first part, a somewhat clean hit is shown. After that, it's guns blazing! Olyfant does his best, but just doesn't add up to the standard which the games have set before him. All the other characters are as flat as a pancake on the ceiling, and the action sequences and one liners are over-the-top cliché and done. The one good action scene takes place in a train station of sorts, where a shoot-out occurs between several Hit men. so my advice to you IMDb'rs out there is simple: Like the games? Go see the movie, it feels nice to see your hero on the big screen. Don't like 'em? Don't see the movie, because you'll end up disappointed. So my final score: 6,5/10 (I'm a huge fan of the games by the way)",Hitman

That being said, I'm not a gamer so I had no connection to this story. I can only judge what's put before me, and frankly, I thought it was pretty damn good. In case it's not been noticed yet, Tim Olyphant is our generation's Clint Eastwood. He's developed into a great versatile actor with a lot of style. The way he moves, in a a very straight, gliding posture, is a page out of classic Clint. Nothing wrong with that. He has a wicked unflinching stare. And he's great at the tough guy-with-a-soft-spot-for-justice roles. I like the physicality he brings. He's a little on the tall side and it's nice to see a long lean frame throwing kicks and blows. I'm also going to say that Olga was there for you men, but for women like me who likes a man of action and not afraid to rack up a high body count, Tim was there for us. (Thank you to a director who actually seemed to get that for once.) So on the plot side of the movie, OK so the whole freaking thing is far-fetched, so what? This isn't a documentary.

This is because hit-man is meant to be a silent assassin, but in this film see seems to just shot anyone in his way. Now if you did this in a hit-man game you would get caught or get a poor rating, so basically what I'm trying to get at is that this film is not true to style of the game which is a major down point of it. I also don't like the typical James Bond girl that follows him around, first of all hit-man is a ruthless killer not a secret agent working for the government, and when has hit-man ever taken a girl in the games? Having saying this some of the film is good, a good inclusion was the kids playing the actual hit-man game when he drops in to there room. What is also missing form the film is the great environments form the games and the 'accidental' kills which really put the game in a class of its own.To some this film up it tried to put in additional action to make the film more lively but instead made it dull and less atmospheric.

Even other scenes are very clumsy in this movie, pretty much every scene with hit-man and his love, his acting was horrible. The other thing was that during the watching reminded me many times the Bourne movies (which were more than perfect)and seemed like a really bad copy to me. Anyway the movie could be good, the whole idea was good, but it's very amateur instead.",Hitman
271,vivalaricicles,disappointing....,2,21 April 2008,"slick, professional, calculating and cold. These are the words that are suppose to describe 47. Instead we got the generic Hollywood action film that feels as if the link to Hit-man was thrown into the script before it was filmed. It honestly felt as if the writer, Skip, had written it as a no brainer action film and then thought how can i make it more interesting? I know! I'll change the leads characters name to 47 and call it hit-man. The similarity between the game and the film stop there. i'm slightly baffled as to whether or not i've seen the same film as some people, the positive reviews saying that it is faithful to the films must of been written by Xaviers army of henchman trying to big him up. the one thing i think i expected from the film was one super slick assassination that showed us just how cool, cold and dam badass 47 was. instead we got a unbelievably lame kill right at the beginning. i don't want to talk about it. i don't actually know why i'm wasting my time writing about this film, if only to warn others not to see it.",Hitman
272,darkrapster,Hit-man missed its target.....badly,2,21 November 2007,"Okay what can i say about Hit-man that hasn't already been said? For the people who played the games, prepared to be disappointed as your hero Agent 47 is now a baby faced balding man with a gun who is in love with a prostitute. *okay we'll say girlfriend for pay* For people who haven't played the games, this is basically a watered down version of the Bourne Identity with clones and a slightly less handsome killer.A lot of the cast seems to lack emotion and the only one who does is Timothy Olyphant himself!! Mr. Agent 47 who supposed to show no emotion, goes throughout the movie like an awkward teenager going through puberty.In many scenes Nika is literally hanging off of 47, flirting with him in every way possible while 47 awkwardly rejects her advances to the point of.....*Spoilers Ahead* In one scene Nika gets 47 back to the hotel room where she proceeds to straddle him on the bed and strip, and right as she goes in for the kill *you know what i mean*, he shoves a needle of a sleeping agent in her neck and leaves her slumped halfway off the bed partially naked for the rest of the night.......*Spoilers Ended* The entire time while watching this movie, i thought i might've been watching an edit of one of the Bourne movies, and maybe Matt Damon finally decided to go with the bald look, and a terrible script.Overall I can't blame the director for trying to create from this popular video game series, as most movie watchers would be turned off by the emotionless hero we call actual Agent 47.If your a fan of the game i wouldn't recommend this movie. If your new to the series, its a decent *and no more* action movie with lots of gun fights and explosions. Have fun out there movie land!",Hitman
273,robb6788,A real piece of crap,4,4 May 2009,This movie is just a complete waste of time. It uses the likeness of hit-man the video game to lure in fans and the appeal of the bond and bourne movies to get the rest of us to watch. Its too stupid for non gamers and too much of a let down to those that did play the game. The action is lame. None of the scenes make any sense. Just an excuse to show something blow up or show a fight scene. The actor Timothy Olymphant does a good job with the material he has. But its not much to work with. A stunt man probably could have carried this movie and saved on budget. Realism was not an element included in the writing of this script. The plot wasn't well delivered or explained. Don't even bother to watch this one on your netflix.,Hitman

I have never played the Hit-man game - I've have only seen how it looks, and from that I must conclude that the film resembles it excellently! But you do not have to have any kind of knowledge about the game to understand the film. Timothy Olyphant does an amazing job! From his calm voice to his cool walk - it is just thoroughly done in (almost) all aspects! And of course I am very pleased to see a Danish actor in this fantastic film! Ulrich Thomsen is too cool - now also in Russian :)I have only one more thing to say: Go see the film, you will not be disappointed.",Hitman

276,nighthawk936,judge after you watch..,7,29 November 2007,"I'm a fan of the game, and when i first hear hit-man is coming out this year, i'm very excited of course when i see timothy olyphant starring as agent 47, i was disappointed, and seeing screen-shots of 47 and the girl doesn't make any sense to me. agent 47 is supposed to be a professional killer and nothing else. anyways i still went to the movie to show my appreciate for the game that i liked, and i can say, that the movie is much better than the first impressionyes everyone wonders why 47 is timothy olyphant originally, but then when you have Olga Kurylenko involved in this movie, it will only make sense to have him serve the role, instead of Vin diesel. everyone wonders, why is there a girl in this movie? answer is simple: remember doom the movie? it sucked. why? it looked like everyone's watching someone else play the game instead of a movie with story and plot. same reasons in this case. if this movie only has 47 act solo through the entire movie, there will be no character development. by placing Olga Kurylenko into the movie, 47 has someone to interact and help develop his character. and with that said, timothy olyphant therefore plays the best in this role. and i think we'll prefer timothy olyphant over Vin diesel instead of Olga Kurylenko anytime if that's the case. and for the movie itself, it lacks in depth story-building or a more appealing story, such as the story in Blood Money, where the organization had to close down as they were being hunted, targeting especially 47. however for other hit-man fans out there, I'm pleased to say that the trademark weapons in the Hit-man series are coming back to place. obviously the famous silverballers (thank god they didn't give him glocks nor to fool us with 1911A1) have a lot of appearance in the movie. and others included the sedatives (anyone who plays Hit-man properly knows and is very familiar with it), the W2000 sniper rifle, and the ultimate: fiber wire. other details from the game included watching 47 fly through the room only to find kids playing Hit-man Blood Money on TV, Diana, a very Hit-man-style assassination inside the toilet, red neon sign scene, and the final shot. and other parts of the movie included humor that mixed well with 47's personalities. 47 is more talkative in this movie, for the purpose of more character build (as mentioned above, why Olga Kurylenko is in play), but remains being his cold personalities, therefore his humorous lines, along with Olga Kurylenko into play, are quite interesting chemistry although there are areas the movie can improve in, yet this movie emerges out better than expected, and definitely hope it gets better if there's sequel following up to it",Hitman
277,imdb-10900,A script written in crayon,3,31 January 2008,"Decent acting, decent director and decent budget destroyed by a script written in crayon. There's no excuse for a movie like this. This goes on the pile of drek of movies from video games like BloodRayne1/2. Our hero, a hit-man trained from birth and known only as 47 has been pursued by a cop from Interpol for 3 years. One thing clearly obvious is that this cop sucks. For one thing, 47 is bald and has a bar-code tattooed on the back of his head just like his other dozen or two assassins running around in this film. You'd think just from that that maybe there would be a APB for bald guys with bar codes on their head. Maybe the director should have taken some artistic license as has been done with other comic and video game translations and maybe moved the bar-code where it could be concealed by a shirt collar.Starting with this, scene after scene simply stretches credulity. He assassinates the president of Russia publicly in front of hundreds of witnesses. Blood from a head shot to the face splatters dozens. Yet somehow not one of them speaks up when the Russians later claim that he missed and the president is fine. The secret is known only by the president's double and a secret police chief. Yet somehow they are able to pull off this hoax. Agent 47 asks his control who hired the hit on the president and he is told the president hired him. Now, you'd think if your taking down orders for hit jobs you might have asked a question or two when someone orders a hit on himself other than ""Would you like fries with that?"" 47 instinctively knows that a woman witness he is told to must have information he needs to get himself out of his dilemma.47 makes a dramatic escape from police by leaping out his hotel window into the river. To bad he booked his room on the other side of the hotel from total lack of foresight for an escape route. Besides police at least a dozen of his brother assassins are after him for no good reason. When confronted 3 to 1 they all decide to put down their guns and duke it out with swords. They are all supposedly trained from birth to kill but their swordfighting apparently comes from a weekend course from the Learning Annex.It just goes on and on like this. How this got higher than a 3 must be from the fanboys of the video game.",Hitman
278,sh-65,Unsatisfying,3,24 December 2007,"Alright, this movie might have 2 different ratings whether you're seeing this because you're a fan of the game or if you're a casual viewer of action movies.This is a review from a fan of the game series, therefore the negative vote. If I was to watch this without any connection to the original material I would probably be more entertained.This is really my problem with this movie (and many other adaptations). I'd rather if any other name was used (my suggestion: Agent Hairless Bourne) because this movie is just a big 100-min-long cliché that tries to profit from Hit-man's fan-base at the same time with just enough game references. I prayed this wouldn't be another ""Doom - The Movie"" but it wasn't too far off.As I said before, if you're not into the games and just want to watch a Jason Bourne clone, then this is your movie.Now if you're a series fan, read on. When I heard an adaptation was under development I wasn't too excited, but I had some hope. Hope because there could be something new that could be done in the movie industry. Now, what's new about 47 that could make him a whole new animal than all other cold blooded killers and secret agents out there? What makes that character, 47, different? 1st: He's a clone. The result of a gene enhancing research program that turned on his creator and became a professional freelance hit-man. They've scrapped all that and rewritten his origins completely. Now how can they still call him by the same name after that? I mean, if someone asks me what's the story behind this character, I will now have to answer with another question: ""Which one? The movie hit-man or the game's hit-man?"" The ""adaptation"" dies right there in my opinion.2nd: Agent 47 is the result of a genetic experiment and post training, aimed at creating a superior human being, in strength and mind, with no conscience. That's exactly what he is in the games, but as I feared it would get (knowing how filmmakers tend to think of what people want to see on-screen) he shows too much of a conscience in the movie with an all-too-expected female role that he shows affection to, that he even promises to visit after they part on the train.3rd: One big difference of the Hit-man games, from other action games, is the fact that agent 47 is rewarded for being as silent as possible, a ghost as he's referred to in the movie. A big gun fight in a crowded room is a big no-no, leaving witnesses alive is not his thing too and usually, targets tend to die from strange accidents rather than in a bathroom filled with bodyguards with bullets on their heads. The movie tells a story of a whole different character... I mean, what's up with that scene to kill Udre? I will go see a Rambo movie if I want to, I will not go watch a Hit-man-branded movie to see that overused matrix-cliché royal mess. Oh, and the countless female witnesses that survived that scene? That would be called a ""restart mission"" in my book.4th: Another distinctive mark of the Hit-man game brand is his proficiency to disguise of all types of people after he properly disposes of their bodies in the course of each mission. I remember him doing this once in the end of the movie. I can't be bothered to watch it again so I might be wrong on the number of times he's done this but the fact that I can't remember that happening is a good indication of how overlooked that ""feature"" was.So this is what made me hate this movie. Not because the movie is bad in essence, but because of this horrible trend of people trying to profit from a well-developed brand with well-developed characters, and rewrite everything that makes them what they are. Had this movie been given a different name, I would have enjoyed it a lot more.Other slightly bad points: 1) Realism. This one I start to overlook on these movies... as much as it pisses me off, it's so common, that my expectations are lower right off the bat. The scene with the 4 hit-men is a good example of that. Why on earth would those cold-blooded killing machines decrease their chances of completing their contracts by holding fire, closing in on each other and then just stand there, to successfully stare at each others ugly faces for all that time until agent 47 breaks the ice? And why on earth were those agents pointing their weapons at each other instead of completing their assignment by ventilating 47? If it was argued that they were rivals between themselves, then why didn't they kill each other with the blades too? But that's OK, it's a scene made to look good and stylish (and mindless). Now just wait until someone figures out that a scene can look good, stylish AND make sense at the same time! 2) Olyphant. Looks too young and not so ruthless as the game model. His voice isn't anywhere near David Bateson's (47's game voice) coldness and low-tone power. The acting wasn't bad though, it probably wasn't a very demanding role emotionally, but still, he delivered what it would take for his role. The problem is that, even though he did well, I feel that the choice could have been much closer to what the game offers.So, this is it, the score of 3 represents the view of a huge series fan that had his expectations higher than the casual action movie fan. 3 is for the satisfying acting performances and the action scenes that would probably result in a higher score from someone unaware of the original material.",Hitman

Since I haven't played that game a lot, I took my cousin who is ""In love"" of that game. I asked his opinion and he said that there isn't a lot facts matching the game and that he was a bit disappointed. So. The creators wrote a new scenery. And I think they failed. Althou this movie had style. 47 was impressive and stylish, Olga was hot, explosions were awesome, effects were..... good. In my opinion it could have been much better. What disappointed me for sure, is that Hollywood actors tried to create Russian characters and it didn't worked. I mean a know Russian language a little, but when I heard how they are speaking in it I couldn't stop laughing. Especially when ""the president"" spoke. Russian accent they did great, but Russian they spoke Really bad. Couldn't they just asked for some Russians to act abit? I liked 47, I liked Nika, I loved Audi, but ""Hitman"".... Good luck on the next time.",Hitman
280,datmfnp,A kick-ass movie from the video game,8,14 April 2008,"I'm somewhere in between a lot of the viewers I think. I've played Hit-man, but I never got too involved with the games, so I'm not a fanatic. I thought the movie was great though. Plenty of good action sequences and fights, guns or not, hot girls, and an interesting story. Timothy Olyphant played Agent 47 well, although I would have originally thought someone with a more European look and slimmer, more defined face would have been chosen. He still played the character great though. I liked how Nika and 47 interacted with each other, and the relationship was good, great chemistry. She gave a more human edge to 47 without making him become a wimp. There was Just enough humor and sensitivity, but not too much. He was still a cold-blooded killer that would split your head open without having to think much about it. He's not exactly the conflicted villain turned hero that I thought he would be.With that being said, I think you could make great sequel to this. I thought the movie was going to be more heavily based on the first video game that I played, but they could make that Hit-man 2. You hit-man gamers know what I'm talking about. In the video game he retires from being a professional hit-man and gives up that lifestyle to move to a remote village and church in Sicily. He lives this peaceful life and doesn't want to go back to killing, but those mobsters or whoever end up coming to find him and kill the priest. Then 47 picks the guns back up and goes out for revenge.I think that would make a SICK sequel, if there's a demand for it. I don't know how much money Hit-man made, so I don't know, but they definitely should make that for Hit-man 2 anyway. Just ice the Nika character and say she was killed. It had something to do with one of his missions, and that (among other reasons) is why he goes off the radar and quits being a hit-man. Go from there.I would recommend the movie to anyone who enjoys action and ""guy"" movies, without a doubt.",Hitman

IMHO there should have been more to watch maybe another target for him to kill .. still i highly recommend the movie even if you aren't a big fan of the game. Timothy Olyphant was great in the way he performed agent 47 .. the way he walks , the way he moves or look , he literally rocked .After all , i wish that the 20th century would think of producing another hit-man as good as this one or maybe better .",Hitman
284,half-echilon,AESOME. they didn't screw this one up.,9,22 November 2007,"**SPOILERS** sorry guys. had to be done for the reviews sake.wow. i must say, for another movie being released on what is arguably one of the coolest ""stealth/shooter"" video game series out, it was a REALLY good movie.Gratuitous violence, explosions, and did i mention boobies.?I was skeptical at first; the game character, Agent 47, was BASED in looks on the video game's voice actor, David Bateson. Literally. But Olyphant pulled no punches, and even in situations were the actor COULD have gone in a complete ulterior direction with the character, he stayed true to form.The movie starts in present day, and uses the flashback method to track 47's progress through a series of hits. Having apparently botched an assassination attempt on the current Russian president, 47 moves through various locales (taken RIGHT out of the game, mind you) to track down the only witness to his crime. OF COURSE, being Hollywood, she's amazingly gorgeous. and did i mention she gets naked. because she gets naked. several times. a lot. Throughout the rest of the movie, the intrepid hit-man follows a path of murder and betrayal to find out who's been setting him up, and to finish the job he was originally contracted to do.The acting in the movie wasn't bad at all; stale at times, but OLYPHANT NAILS 47 TO THE ""T"". His ultra calm demeanor, no matter the situation, is capitalized by a more realistic portrayal of the human 47. In the game, you never really take into account what 47 does when hes NOT killing, and they were at least able to show the discord of an emotionless human killing machine. The rest of the cast's acting is sub-par, with the head interpol agent, played by Dougray Scott, leading the merry band of lemmings off of an acting cliff. BUT, WHO CARES. the movie was about 47, and Timothy Olyphant played the role perfectly.The movie takes place all over the European world, with shots LITERALLY taken right out of the game. if you're a fan-boy of the series, you wont be disappointed. The script purposely avoids the origin concept, with good measure; i would have rather seen it done exactly to the game, having already been a quite interesting plot in of itself. Instead of deviating from the story at hand, they flashback only to his childhood in snippets throughout the intro credits; but its enough that you get the picture. The original game focuses on the cloning experiments of the worlds foremost 6 criminal masterminds, in an attempt to create a genetically perfect human killing machine. the MOVIE tells of a school with ties to all and loyalty to none, in which orphaned and rejected children are trained from an early age in all aspects of combat. to be used through their contracting agency for their sole explicit purpose: killing.All in all, Olyphant MAKES the movie worth watching. Definitely worth paying for to see on a big screen. Definitely worth eventually owning. if you're a fan of the game series, this movie will rock your socks off. 9 out of 10.",Hitman

I have been a loyal Hit-man video game enthusiast since the beginning and was looking forward to the movie. Timothy Olyphant is the perfect Hit-man character for the movie, and i am happy they got that right. But overall this is not based on the video game. In the game he strives after perfection and being like a ghost as they explain in the movie, but i don't see this. It seams that he doesn't really know what he's doing half the time and there is to much action and explosions to make him worthy of being called Agent 47. Agent 47 is like a god at his craft.

Hit-man is different in that even viewed as a stand alone movie it's pretty damn good. Olyphant as Agent 47 is excellent (just how he resists Olga Kurylenko with no panties on is beyond me!! lol) but I just felt that the movie gripped me and I actually had a connection with the two main characters, willing them on to succeed.

'Skip' has simply dissected other famous 'lone gunman' style films, poured in a great deal of crass one-liners, unnecessary (although enjoyable) nudity and attempted to deliver an espionage sub plot, leaving the audience wondering why anyone is really doing what they are doing.

288,nba_all_star1989,Awesome movie from a great game!!!,10,25 November 2007,"This movie was a great adaptation of the hit game franchise. Good direction, good acting and remarkable effects. This is the type of movie that satisfies all movie-goers. The movie not only intrigues with the right amount of content, it also leaves you wanting more at the same time. Im giving this film a 10/10 because in a line of good game to movie adaptations, only a few can be considered as great movies. Hit-man is one of them along with Silent Hill, Tomb Raider and Resident Evil. In my opinion the movie is more greatly appreciated if you have previously played the game. By playing the game it is easier to follow storyline and understand the origins of Agent 47. In saying that I do have one small complaint about this film. I will admit that I was very pessimistic about the casting of Timothy Olyphant for the role of Agent 47. After seeing he movie I was very surprised. The movie hinged on Olyphant's performance and he was able to become the cold-blooded no questions ask assassin Agent 47 was. He was good as Agent 47 but I still believe that the actor for Agent 47 in the games, David Bateson, should have been their first choice. Not only was he the voice actor for Agent 47, but he was also the model they used for the in-game Agent 47. David Bateson has the perfect look and the accent that completely fits the bill. Other than that the movie was still very good and I hope the sequel for the movie will be coming out soon.",Hitman
289,Gyrannon,"Good title, Too short for a movie, Not Hit-Man friendly",5,15 January 2011,"When I first saw the trailers, I jumped at the chance to see this movie, I love the Hit-Man game series and was hoping for a movie of the game to be released. However, I did not expect only 5% of it to match the game, I expected at least 80%. The first assassination in the movie was spot on, and I hoped that it was going to be that great from beginning to end - my hopes inevitably went to disappointment. Timothy Olyphant's performance as Agent 47 was below average, he showed too much emotion for a highly trained assassin, and was far more lenient than the original 47 would've been.Agent 47 is like the character Dexter, but unlike Dexter, 47 has no friends, no links to his past, and isn't wandering around searching for himself, 47 is the world's greatest assassin an gets paid to do what he does best: Take out the target in the manner specified an leave no evidence that 47 was even there. The games made 47 into a Legend and a Myth, but the movie does the exact opposite.There are a couple things that should NOT have been in the movie: 1) Romance - He is better off alone, he is the greatest at what he does because he has no one to worry about that could potentially jeopardize his task at hand. 2) Short Dark Angel back story - Agent 47 is a clone of a certain man, and was trained to be an assassin. In the games he was trained as an adult, but according to the movie he was trained as a child, and apparently tried to escape with his fellow clones (clones that didn't resemble 47 in the slightest). People who know nothing about the game & its story might not care or notice that the first video with kids being trained as soldiers was taken from the TV Show ""Dark Angel"". Fans of the game no doubt noticed that fact an most would see it as a cheap way to deliver a back story by ripping off a TV show. 3) Clone Faces don't Match - The game also showed that all of the other Agents that were trained at the same facility all had the same face and body structure, the only real way to tell them apart was their code names, hence the reason why the main character's name is Agent 47; he is the 47th clone! The movie did a poor job at upholding this part of the story of Hit-Man: All the clones were of different races, different heights, different ages, different body structures, and different faces, this implies that all of them were cloned from different people instead of just one man. 4) Finally, the people who were chasing him saw his face, and what does 47 do to remedy his situation? He lets the man who saw his face go. The game version of 47 would not leave any traces or leads for the world to go on that could lead 47 to his inevitable doom.Hollywood made a decent attempt to make a good movie out of well known & well loved game series, but made too many mistakes in its creation. They honestly could have done better with this movie and actually followed the story & released it as it was meant to. I rate this movie a 5/10, not a complete failure, had a somewhat interesting story, but ultimately did not do Agent 47 justice.For those who know nothing about the game series, I would recommend watching this movie for its decent suspense, good action scenes, and a few surprises in the movie, the end will be unexpected. For fans of the game series, I highly recommend that you watch a different movie that shows more promise, it's many flaws and ""made up by Hollywood"" story will destroy your love for Agent 47.",Hitman

291,lordofpain1983,The best movie game ever since Mortal Combat?,10,27 December 2007,"It was, I think, about a year ago when I first learned that one of my favorite games of all time was about to become a movie. My first reaction was who is going to play Mr 47? After some speculations on who is going to be Hit-man it was finally official! Mr Timothy Olyphant is going to be the coolest anti-hero in gaming history! I must admit I didn't quite understand why someone would choose him as the Bald Emotionless man!?! Anyway the movie was finally ready (after quite a while!) and I found myself holding the ticket and ready to witness the disappointment of my life!!! But I was in for a huge surprise! I must admit I didn't expect it to be a good movie let alone to represent the amazing game...Now I must admit that I am a huge Hit-man fan! That said the movie was exceptional! The plot was very good, near the main theme of the game (Mr 47 against the world), cool characters, the director (Xavier Gens) did an exceptional work and they could not find a finest girl (Olga Kurylenko) to play the hide an seek with good old Mr 47! And last but not least the fantastic Timothy Olyphnat as Mr 47! He is phenomenal!!! I think he spent hours playing the game so he could act about Mr 47 as best as he could!!! He walks like him for god's sake!!! Very good non emotional work by Mr Olyphant! There are a couple of ""game camera views"" to add to the taste!!! Although there are some not so great elements in the film as the fact that there is a really ""curious"" bond between Mr 47 and Nika and a fight scene that I was not used to from the game! All in all its a great movie for everyone (excluding minors!!!)! A 9 for anyone who is not a Hit-man fan, a solid 10 for the rest of us! Can't wait for 2...",Hitman
292,ishtar0171,Impressive,9,19 May 2010,"I honestly wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. I thought it would be one of those stereo typical ""good guy shoots all the bad guys"" type movies. But it surprised me with 47's relationships with Nika and the Interpol agent. Not to mention the truly impressive fight scenes. I think the four-way sword fight was my favorite.The main character's not a perfect good guy, not a perfect bad guy, and not one of those characters who has to work through emotional problems from his past (usually involving parents). This (to me at least) makes him truly enjoyable to watch. It definitely makes the short list of movies I plan to buy.",Hitman
293,Phacider,Good action but difficult to follow.,5,8 December 2007,"Well, to start with, I have played the 3 hit-man games, and I was very excited to see this. However, even knowing the story of the hit-man games, the movie was a bit hard to follow.*SPOILER ALERT* Several things bothered me. First who was chasing him again? CIA, KGB, NSA, OPEC, NASA? I could barly follow who was after him. Second, they never went into why the other hit men were after him. The end didn't make any sense either. I felt like the movie was just throwing so much stuff at you so you couldn't ask questions. *Spoiler END*Ultimately, I would say, if you were a fan of the video games, maybe a rental, otherwise you may just have a hard time following this movie.",Hitman
294,jcorvin,"Tim Olyphant was not a good Hit-man, and movie was boring",3,29 November 2007,"as a fan of all four hit-man games I was jacked up to see this movie, but man was I disappointed. The story was thin as a spaghetti noodle and Tim did not play a good hit-man. Tim is know as the sarcastic funny man in most of his other movies, so for him to play someone with no sense of humor that was really odd. I thought it was no where near the game especially with that stupid sword scene...in none of the games do you wield a sword enough to constitute him have two in his jacket. Also was it necessary to have the naked scene in there? I mean is there a naked scene in the video game? That is why I hate when Hollywood gets a hold of video game movies because there is a 99% chance they have never played the game, so they screw it all up. Just look at ""Doom""...very good video game series, but horrible movie. Very poor adaption of the Hit-man game and I was very disappointed with it.",Hitman
295,bryanpope,"Hit-man a hit, man!",10,2 December 2007,"Though I have honestly only played the Hit-man *2* game, and only for a couple hours at that, I found this movie very entertaining. The main character, # 47, does a great job portraying a full blooded assassin with a conscience and gentle side (something I would have thought to be hard to accomplish. He makes it look natural.) Everyone else seems to do a good job as well; the slut acts slutty, the dirty horny men act like dirty horny men, and the big bad guys that work for the FBI or the government act just as smooth and cocky as you could hope, though I found myself wishing for the actor that played Agent Smith to appear a few times. There's just enough battle scenes to suit anybody's fancy, and enough informational sequences in between to get the viewer into the characters and the story. My only concerns would have to be a lack of intense music (some tech-no or hardcore opera would have intensified the spine chilling) and that the film seemed a tad too short (a few more boss baddies and maybe a couple extra examples of just how sharp 47 was would have been welcome, but don't necessarily feel needed). All in all, whether you're a fan of the game or not, this movie is a must see. I'm incredibly confused at all of the negative reviews going around. If you want my advice, screw em and go see this movie. You'll leave the theaters wanting to shave your head, tattoo a bar code on the back of your head, kill bad guys and see a sequel at least somewhat close to the greatness of this film sometime soon. It would make me happy if this became a series.",Hitman

Unlike all the other vg movies that take the game and shreds the story or changes it into something ridiculous this one stays true to the heart of Hit-man the game.The movie is quite simply summarized as ""Kill your Target"" as is what you do in the game. In the game you kill your target and complete your mission with little or relatively no plot, and this is exactly how this movie is!! You don't need a plot for a movie of a game that has no plot otherwise you would ruin it. This movie is filled with elements from the game as 47 changes into the clothes of his victims, performs kills stealthy and also brutally, uses the syringe, it even has a scene where 47 jumps into a window of two teens playing Blood Money.I also like the way they did the ""minor"" love backstory they did, notice I said minor because its there, but its not important to the movie or in fact to 47. His whole goal in this movie is to kill the target in which he was set out to do and he does it well! I eagerly await this to come out on HDDVD and DVD.",Hitman
298,monkeybars101,Awesome!,5,22 February 2008,"Also got to say the movie was done extremely well, if you enjoyed the game this is the movie choice for you. Some acting was a let down, from the girl mainly but Timothy Olyphant was fantastic (so glad it was not Jason Stanton, the guy off transporter) This movie you could actually believe maybe some shooting scenes are far-fetched, but that is what I expected in an action movie. I think there will be a sequel, And I'm waiting for it. :D Also uses many game references in the movie, A camera angle when he is walking down the corridor is one, this adds to the effect.

300,flannimal,we have seen it all better before,1,7 May 2008,I don't see why you have to watch this .Timothy Olyphant gives a awkward and stale performance as agent 47 with a bar code on his head.the explosions look almost like those glittery explosions in power rangers.what has happened to originality in movies honestly making a game adaptation is sad and uninspired or those many j-horror films coming out every month.I myself played the game with its infinite amount of depth and where every choice you make is vital.Where as the movie has as much depth as a kiddy pool but if you like senseless killing.Its better than most video game adaptations but still everything in the movie you've seen has been done better before but its not terrible.,Hitman
301,covertrunning,Superior Video Game to Film adaption,9,15 January 2008,"The comments by jon.h.ochiai echo what I noticed of the film. A very good video-game to film conversion that stands as a film in its own right.Acting from Tim Olyphant is first-rate stuff. Having only really seen him in 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' (which did not impress me) I was impressed by his performance in Hit-man. Hardly even recognised it was him.A lot of the mains-stream-media movie critics have given the film a hard-time, saying that the film is ultra-serious and low on plot. The plot was enough and clear enough to see for most. If is one thing that could of totally ruined Hit-man it would be a plot-heavy nature. I suspect it is because they are put-off by the hard-core style violence and adult nature of the film that it offends their soft-core sensibilities. Films that are realistically violent usually do not fare well from the critics review.Some have noted that Tim Olyphant portrays the Agent 47 as showing too much emotion and character in the film. This is a good thing because to make a good video-game-to-film conversion you have to have some human-side traits otherwise the film would be one-dimensional and plain, it also engenders the anti-hero to the audience.The film did very well financially. For a video game-to-film this is an achievement in itself. Roll on the Sequel! :)",Hitman

304,stojiljkovicvlajko,"Average action movie, but not good enough",3,14 November 2010,"Hit-man is one of the most popular video gaming series, with very good story and actions. I was keen on this movie because i like hit-man, and expected to be like the first video game; dark, with good story and epic scenes. Well, that didn't happened. The story is average, and the movie isn't very connected with the video game series, which I find crucial. The plot is weak and Agent 47 isn't portrayed as a genetically made ruthless killer, which i hate the most. Although there are some things that are trademarks of the video game (changing of clothes, fiber wire etc.) the movie doesn't feel like the video game. There is some violence and nudity which I liked, but it's pretty forgettable. So at the end, i was disappointed and turned back to playing Hit-man: Codename 47.PS:IMDb automatically changes h i t m a n into Hit-man",Hitman

306,glendaal,The Critics have gone mad,8,3 December 2007,"Don't be put off by the engulfing negativity surrounding this film. I've never before been so baffled by the Critics consensus regarding a film. A quick read through on rottentomatoes will have you believing this film is one of the worst to come out in years. Well, that's nonsense, I'm pleased to say.Hit-man is an action thriller, much in the same vein as the Bourne movies, and though it may not be as ""blood-pumping"" as those particular movies, I felt more of a connection to Hit-man, being familiar with the video games.You may also hear the plot of this movie is confusing. I personally could'nt understand why people thought this. It was pretty standard espionage fare, nothing you wouldn't see in a James Bond movie for instance. Though because it's based on a video game, many people wrote it off subconsciously, condemning the plot, the acting, the script, everything more or less.I've seen it twice now and it was just as good the second time. However, as good as I think the movie is, it's certainly not perfect. There is one particular scene in a train station that had me cringing because it was so completely unrealistic. Though the scene itself is exciting and well choreographed, I couldn't get over how out of place it was. Also, at times, the dialogue did seem like it needed a bit of refinement, i.e when a certain character responded to a political conversation by saying ""So, you're telling me to F**k off?"". It's lines like this that made me think they were at times, angling the movie towards teenage boys, a theory that was more or unless confirmed when the movies female lead randomly walked around a hotel room naked. Appealing to look at for sure, but rather random.But at the end of the of the day, these came across as minor quibbles and did not spoil my enjoyment overall. The film gets a 7.5 in my book, and I'll definitely be buying the DVD.See, not all video game adaptations have to be disasters.",Hitman
307,RobC86,Disappointment for this H i t m a n fan...,4,25 November 2007,"So I was really excited to see this film. From the previews, it looked like it had potential to be a very good adaptation of the video game series. Unfortunately after only a few minutes of watching the film I realized this was not what I thought I was paying for. This seemed like a Bourne film more than anything else, with the exception of a bald guy in a suit, and a ton of lookalikes. While by itself, the movie wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been, the total failure to follow any of the structure set in the games is mind blowing. First, the music choice was HORRIBLE in this film, with the exception of the opening credit sequence, which was truly great. The music sounded like it had been ripped from any generic action film that used an orchestra. The plot was weak and had more holes than I could count. The CIA element left me wondering what the heck was going on, and the protective nature of 47 was really unexpected. The lack of stealth was appalling. All in all, while the film had a few points that made me instantly think of the video games, the a good portion of the film was a direct copy of the Bourne films, whether it was in the cinematography, music, or editing. I think it could have been much better. If you are a fan of the series, just remember that the games are truly great and the movie is an attempt to cash in on its popularity, not please its fans. Hopefully the next game won't look anything like this film, and will instead follow in the steps of Blood Money and the other games.On a side note, the random Russian whore he protects most of the film is naked most of the time, and I thought this was not necessary. The film is supposed to be about 47, not some random Russian who wants to sleep with 47.",Hitman
308,Rmb_,Excellent video game adaptation,7,17 March 2008,"Adapting a video game such as Hit-man into a good movie seems to me a hard act to pull, owing to a few problems: there is little plot to speak of in the games, the main character is an anti-hero (he kills for money) and the game relies heavily on ,for lack of a better word, coolness. However, for the most part disregarding these problems, the makers have pulled it off anyway and have delivered a well put-together, coherent and downright fun action movie that will definitely not disappoint fans of the series.For starters, the story isn't bad at all, which is so often the case with video game adaptations, unfortunately. Although it felt a bit rushed at times, the story is an interesting cat-and-mouse game that doesn't feel contrived or contains the run-of-the-mill plot twists nearly every thriller/action movie nowadays runs into and suffers from. The only real problem is that it was, as before mentioned, a bit rushed at times, which meant that some of the subtleties were lost on me. Overall however, I had the feeling that the writers took a lame story (video game) and turned it into an amusing and compelling action script. The direction wasn't great, but the action scenes were all that could be hoped for. Fortunately the makers didn't skimp on the stylistic touches that, to me, helped make the games great. As such we get to see plenty of slow-motion shots in which 47 uses his silenced Hardballers to perforate many a bad guy. To my surprise, the acting was quite good. Although I'd seen Timothy Olyphant in a few other movies, his acting talents had never quite impressed me. In this movie however, he succeeds really well as the cold-blooded, yet not so apathetic killer he portrays. The side parts were good as well, with Dougray Scott solidly portraying the Interpol agent that gets eluded by 47 time and again.Last but not least, the music was really fitting. Although the same theme keeps playing throughout the entire movie, it never gets boring or annoying, and merely adds to the frantic cat-and-mouse game it serenades. All in all, with Hit-man, the movie industry delivers a solid and energetic action flick that should definitely be enjoyed by fans of the series, but also by people who had never heard of Agent 47 before. 7/10",Hitman
309,magnus-151,The greatest game2movie conversion this far!,9,29 March 2008,"I am a fan of the gameserie Hit-man. Not a superfan but very much like the games. So I just loved the exiting moment during the movie where shots were taken as from the games. The director has done a very good job picking many details from the games and without changing too much.I saw this movie again after a week... and I confirmed to myself that this is very good. For Hit-man fans this is a clear 9'er.. Not 10 because it lacks some pro-acting,, but a Hit-man fan don't care. For those who never heard of the games, this might be a 5-6 on the scale.As for me.

310,thereisnospoon333,Quite Disappointed,2,29 March 2008,"This film was rather disappointing. The main complaint I have is that the plot barely made sense. It seems as if they tried to shove every plot device they could think of into the 90 minutes, which made the film seem rushed and nonsensical. The acting felt stiff and the dialog forced. Most of what was going on didn't even have time to register with the viewer, which didn't seem to matter much as it only led to another gun fight.There was no depth, back story or character development whatsoever, which is a big point of the game franchise. It seems as if they took for granted that every single movie-goer has played and completed every Hit-man game made. They tried to make you feel for characters that you've barely known for a half of an hour, and most of that time was spent shooting other people in pseudo-stylized fight scenes that didn't make sense in the story. I actually found myself laughing out loud when one particularly ""epic"" gun battle erupted less than a minute into a scene, leaving no time for the viewer the understand what exactly led to this random fight.Don't get me wrong, I enjoy fast-past films; I also appreciate it when a film forces the view to think for him or herself. However, these things have to be done correctly in order to achieve the desired effect, and this most certainly was not done correctly (you have the stale dialog, poorly choreographed action scenes, and sloppy editing to thank for that). If you're curious, play one of the games. Don't waste your time with this.",Hitman
311,arghorn,Didn't need to me more than what it is.,8,1 December 2007,"As an avid fan of the video game franchise, i must admit, this was one of the best game-to-movie adaptation i have watched so far. After reading a few comments on IMDb regarding its poor plot and great acting, i didn't get my hopes high. For the acting part, it sure was great. Olyphant in the leading role as Hit-man actually ""is"" Hit-man. He managed to mimic most of the character's moves and expressions. The supporting actors play their part just fine and never get in the way of the flow of the action. As for the story, it didn't need to be more than what it is. It introduces you to the character Hit-man, enlights you on what he does for a living and leaves a lot of room for future plots regarding his own personal story, which i definitely look forward to watch in sequels (the whole cloning-experiment thing).All in all, i was more than happy and relieved as i left the theater. 8 out of 10",Hitman
312,bluebullet,Another horrible adaption,4,24 November 2007,"Being a fan of the Hit-man gaming franchise, I was looking forward to the movie. When I first saw the trailer, I screamed it joy in the theater. After I saw the movie I walked out of the theater dumbfounded. They ruined yet another movie.**This does contain spoilers** There are countless things that are wrong with this film. It was obvious that the person who wrote the movie, had no idea what the games were about. It seems as if he played it for 30 min. then tried to write a movie about it.Problem 1 : The detective in the film who is chasing 47, did a poor job of it might I add, seems to know a lot about 47 but whenever he asked about his reasoning he says, ""My boy never misses"" or ""This is how he is."" It would have been better to have flash back to previous missions that 47 had committed that would tell the audience how 47 works. Also the detective should have died from the very beginning. 47 doesn't leave witnesses and it showed that he had a weakness. 47 has a weakness? Problem 2 : The women. There should have been no women in this film what so ever. To suggest that 47 would even have relations or feelings for a target is laughable. I repeat Laughable! I would have understood if it was just a charade and he was planning on killing her in the end... but that didn't happen. The movie ended up focusing around her and their love rather the murder and violence at hand. Sure there was some murder scenes, which were actually pretty good, but they didn't receive the attention they desperately needed.Problem 3 : I am glad that he used his famous silver ballers but there was no fiber wire. For the Hit-man enthusiast the fiber wire is your best friend. It should have been used at least once but it never was. Instead , our wonderful fiber wire was replaced by a tie.Problem 4 : Swords. Where the hell did this writer get the idea for swords? In what point did 47 or any other assassin in the franchise use a sword? Problem 5 : The script was poorly made. I often found myself in the theater yawning and dying for some violent death scenes. The thing that made me most upset about this movie, was the nudity. There didn't have to be any nudity in this movie what so ever! This movie is about violence, death, and destruction. Not tits, sex, women! I was appalled mostly because it was placed there for the sole reason of ""Oh we have to put tits in this movie so that people will like it!"" This movie will disappoint people especially the hard core video game fans. I do not recommend it for anybody. The only good thing out of this movie was the few violent hits that 47 committed but other than that, its stupid.",Hitman

Once you accept that basic premise, it's value lies in that it delivers exactly what you would expect. I found it rather enjoyable and it was especially nice to see some other worthy actors in the lead roles instead of the over-exposed, traditional Hollywood blockbuster names.And girls...this is for you...Timothy Olyphant (the drug dealer from Go) is hot, hot, hot in the lead role.

I wasn't expecting it but olyphant does an excellent job as 47 as do the supporting cast, the action scenes are well spaced out, well directed and apart from one scene ( lost fans will reconise desmond ) are not over the top, i also thought the blood splatter effects from the gunshots were really good. The run time of the film is spot on at 90 minutes and its never boring, you always want to find out who or what.If you don't like games or play games, don't let that put you off this film, it should appeal to anyone who enjoys a decent acting romp with an OK story give it a chance, you wont regret it.",Hitman

The little jokes in the movie distracted me in a not-so-good way. When I walked into the theater I wanted to see a movie that I could take seriously but when everyone pulled out swords I was a little disappointed. Overall if you look at this movie as what it is (a video game adaptation) it is the best one, but that doesn't mean it is a fantastic movie. If this movie didn't have little jokes sprinkled throughout the entire feature then it would have been the perfect video game movie but they had so many things in it that made you think ""is this really what agent 47 would have done?""

316,Null-Entity,OK with the odd highlight.,6,28 April 2008,"OK to clarify from the start I my outlook on this film was bleak, the overall apparent style was WRONG from the word go.Hit-man should be along the lines of LEON not a run of the mill action film. So anyone wanting a true to the games, middle aged bald guy sneaking his ass all over the place and killing in the most unemotional ways possible then walking off out the front door in someone else's clothes.. it isn't this film. There are things they changed for no good reason, like why 47 was not just an orphan instead of a clone.. something that was KEY to the game series in explaining his skill and the change from tactical movements to all out gun fights, and lastly and most up setting, martial arts, 47 is a tank of a man and does very little skillful handiwork, this is perhaps the most obvious and poor change.It did however surprise me in that it is entertaining regardless.There are a lot of moments taken from or inspired by the games, changing clothes/kill methods/characters and scenes/angles, all of which mane you just smile. A good percentage of the film is enjoyable even if simple to watch, the action all except the martial arts scenes are performed well enough and to see he did at least NOT get the woman was something the film makers should be commended on keeping true to the characters.Overall NOT really for DIE HARD fans, but still worth a laugh in the end with points form the games to keep everyone happy.",Hitman

Take your 15$ and go watch this movie, it's awesome, in style of: I want this car, I want this gun, I want this chick!

The game really should not have had as many sequels as it did and hopefully they keep the movies made from it down to just this one.

320,Lavarpsu10,"Decent action movie, but not worthy of the hit-man title",6,23 August 2008,"Hit-man is at heart, a pretty good action movie. Not great, not terrible. But when compared to the series that inspired it, it falls pretty flat.The movie represents a dramatic shift from the tone of the 4 hit-man games. It changes 47's origin story from a genetically perfect clone created to kill to an orphaned child, brainwashed into a ruthless, socially inept, and (most dishearteningly) emotionally vulnerable killer. In addition, the root of the game series is disguise, infiltration and stealth in order to kill a single target with no witnesses and no collateral damage. In the movie, 47 leaves several witnesses (Agent Whittier, girls in the meeting with Udre), messy crime scenes (in the bathroom with Mr. Price) and uses noisy explosions and unsilenced guns to carry out his objectives. Moreover, there's a ridiculous (and inexplicable) swordfight between 47 and 3 other anonymous, random assassins who seemingly crawl out of the woodwork only to die in cinematic ways (the deleted trainyard scene is miles better). The sole sequence faithful to the game was 47's apprehension of Marklov, only to be offset in a huge way by the whole ridiculous action sequence at the end.In essence, Hit-man tries too hard to please fans of the series and the general movie-going public, and it's obvious why they changed aspects of the game. Having a ruthless clone assassin who's worked through all of his (few) moral quandaries by the 2nd in a 4 game series works great for gameplay, but makes for an unsympathetic movie hero. By the same token, a vulnerable, socially awkward Timothy Olyphant comes off as sentimental, wishy-washy and disappointing to fans of the series. Loud, explosive action is also much easier to direct and portray well, rather than the difficulty of creating tension in a stealth sequence where the only danger is that 47 will be discovered before he's done changing into the unconscious waiter's uniform.Every change from the game make sense in terms of pleasing your average moviegoer (love interest, different origin story, etc.), but don't work well overall and the movie feels stretched too thin. Still, at the end of the day it's an above-average video game movie. The producers seem to have at least played Blood Money, they've just changed it to try and please everyone. As is usually the case, it doesn't quite turn out the way they wanted it to.",Hitman

I was thinking the same thing however, but I guess that is one of the Hollywood things they altered in the movie. 47 is supposed to be one of many versions (hence the name 47( stemming from the genetic combination of a host of criminals. On one hand, I guess, one of them could have been black and thus one of versions could have been black or Asian etc. However, I suspect Hollywood adopted the ""adoption theme"" because it is easier to play out and it avoids a political issue as well.Now about the movie. I was happy with it. While not a serious gamer (I only played the second version) I thought it was true to character. All in in, when does 47 every actually talk in the video game. I was weary about the movie from the start, but I think if you like the game, you'll like the movie. I""m not sure if someone who doesn't know anything about the game will like it however. I just can't ignore what I know about the game and character and imagine if I would have enjoyed it was much if I had not known about the game. I suspect they would but so much could go undetected. For example, I don't know if they would understand the significance of 47 going into the restaurant to plant the gun, and later when poisoned the drink so that the target would go into the bathroom.All in all, go see the movie!!!!",Hitman

323,freeyourmind775,Hit-man the Movie,7,24 November 2007,"First, I've heard mostly mixed comments about this movie. But, I'm glad that for the first time in a long time, an ""action"" movie has had an in-depth plot. Not to mention, they captured the personality of 47 near perfectly. When I went to see this, I didn't think I would like it because Timothy Olyphant played such a convincing geek in Die Hard 4, but he did an incredible job of changing roles. The basis behind the movie is that the hit-man is sent to assassinate someone, but it goes bad, which results in him picking up Olga Kurylenko. Now, they tried to add some jokes in, and he does do some things that are completely out of character (such as smiling), but for the most part, he plays the part very well. Now, the hit-man games aren't known for the best plot of all time, but, since the movie focused more on plot then on actual action, it feels a bit refreshing since the games are basically ""Target, Money, Kill"". I'd like to see the next Hit-man game focus more on the plot.Anyway, it's got a great story, 47 is for the most part, played as he should be, and there is enough action to keep you from getting bored.Ranking wise, it's definitely no ""Die Hard 3"" or ""Big Fish"", but it is probably one of the best video-game to movie transitions thats been done in a long time.",Hitman
324,amin-marsafy,Best Movie Adapted from a Video Game,6,21 November 2007,"Two hours ago I was watching one of the best movies this year. For the game fans (whom I am one of them) It is a must see movie. As the movie carries lots of thrill. Also just to see details from the game, things that I expect and then see brings a lot of Joy. This is because unlike other movies this one I had some expectations for and the good thing is it satisfies 90% of them. The acting in the movie is not the best I have seen but the thing is that the main character 47 didn't have emotions in the game and so he did not need any in the movie either. which keeps 47 (Timothy Olyphant) away from criticism as he did his role well. The theme of the movie is just like that of the final release of the Hit-man game series (Hitman: Blood Money) and this includes music and visuals. All in all I rated that movie 9/10, May this is a over rating for the movie but I am considering that I is the top of its genre -Video Game Adapted Movies - which was always a disappointment for the games' fans.",Hitman
325,sobrien21,Pretty Bad Movie: Horrible Dialogue,3,25 November 2007,"First and foremost I wonder at what point Olyphant thought to himself while making this movie, ""Wow, this movie is probably not going to be worth the huge paycheck to look like such an idiot in a sore excuse for a movie"". Hit-man has been so talked up to be a great entertaining movie. And I have to admit they have done a great job doing so; the previews make the movie look respectable, the game was incredible, and the premise is definitely something unique and amazing. Unfortunately this movie met none of those expectations. By no means is the movie respectful, it hardly followed the game's story or character, and the premise of the actual movie was completely tarnished.First of all the action is extremely too few and far between. There really are only two action sequences worth watching. Secondly, Agent 47 is not the emotionless serial killer hit man I was hoping for. They tried to give him feelings and failed miserably doing so. The dialogue was actually laughable between him and Nika, the sorry excuse for a romantic fill in, and actress as well. Half of the theater seriously laughed out loud at the ""serious"" dialogue between the two. Furthermore, the storylinewell, there really is no story line to speak of.I'm extremely disappointed in this movie. They took a great idea and completely ruined it. I'm just glad that I sneaked into the movie for free and didn't waste my money, only my time watching this. I would recommend renting this movie only if you have absolutely nothing else to watch. The only entertaining aspects of this movie are the few glimpses of action, laughing at the dialogue, and making fun of it with your friends afterwards.",Hitman

328,carlitospicy0921,Terrible plot. Terrible actor. Terrible movie.,3,6 December 2007,"Super Mario Brothers, Mortal Kombat, Dead Or Alive, Hit-man. What do these games have in common? Simple, they are games. Yes. They are movies. Yes. They are good games. Yes. They are good movies. No. Fallen to the always daunting task of making money, the movie producers and game producers of our age love one thing. Money. What else gives you a better way to make money, then with a blood soaked romp through Europe with our favorite numerical agent, Agent 47, of the Hit-man series of games.The movie started slow until it hit the first action sequence of events. To be honest it resembled that of a Family Guy episode, just thrown in totally out-of-the-blue. Yes it was good but then it resumed back to the incredibly dry Agent 47. The actor is someone I have never heard of and i hope to never hear from again. I would assume he has to show no emotion but it seemed that when he tried to yell he may bust a larynx. The overall action was very good because yes, I love blood. But when a movie makes me to have the ability to plug my ears and I'm still able to guess what everyone is saying and what will happen next, it dawns on me. Is every video game based movie doomed? What about Splinter Cell. What about God Of War... what about Halo?! All I can think about is how remarkably similar the new-age video game movies are. Blood, blood, bad action, sex scene, blood, bad acting, done. Aren't on a rainy day, or a sneak in. I'm a guy and yet no matter how ""hardcore"" the lead character is, he screams closet homo.

330,metal_maniac639,Fan of the video game? Add this to the disappointment list.,3,21 November 2007,"As a true fan of the video game series, there is many things wrong with this film adaptation. They have all basically been pointed out already, but here are some I can think of:1. The first scenes/intro explains that the children of the agency are orphans, delinquents, etc. and are not clones as they are in the game.2. The first time unveiling 47 he is having a conversation. Stop. Agent 47 rarely even says ANYTHING in the game. To make it worse is what extremely cliché, vague questions he asks. Something to the effect of ""what makes a good man kill?"" and ""are you a good man?"" while speaking to an unknown man(at the time).3. He is shown reading a self help article in a magazine about how to talk to women. I think I saw ""match.com"" minimized on his laptop while getting briefed about his next target.4. 47 gets 'involved' with a female, not kidding. He originally takes her hostage. Stop again. How often does 47 take a hostage? Maybe only for a second to seize fire from attacking law enforcement, before he quickly knocks the hostage out and escapes. And for kicks, shes the main target's girlfriend AND a prostitute.5. I think I counted two or three times 47 lays down his gun to someone hes about to *cough* ruthlessly kill, including the aforementioned hooker. 47 always gets the kill, unless he gets caught/killed, WITHOUT MERCY AND EMOTION.6. 47 and the other agents have dual wielding swords. Dumb, and never seen or mentioned in game.Just the entire way that 47 acts in this movie is ridiculous. I think he should've been played by Vinnie Jones a more mature looking character and should have said very little, not taken any hostages, shown ANY emotion and kill EVERYONE he is supposed to or who has been a witness, etc. Less action and more complexity and intensity.The movie isn't even that great of an action flick. If you want some action, check out Live Free or Die Hard, it's epic. Or just go watch the original Matrix. I gave this movie 3 stars for the little bit of T&A and the scene when he goes to make reservations at the restaurant, when it shows him from the 3rd person view, because that's what reminded me most of the game, and the bathroom assassination scene.",Hitman

Grease acting, empty and shallow lines often do not make much sense, obvious plot holes all over the place. I regret very much spending time on the movie, and seriously wanted a refund + compensation.I was wondering how dare anyone invest money on such an awful script, then I realized the foxy producer is taking advantage of our biased criterias.

I can say with all honesty that I was not disappointed. Yes, a few things were out of character for 47 but it did not really bother me. They made up for it with awkward moments and the most PERFECT 47 walk. It actually looked like a shot out of the game at some points. And all the throw-backs to the game were awesome. The scene where he walks out of a shop in that sleek black suit with that bright red tie...PERFECTION. Timothy Olyphant played the role much much better than I expected he could.

The characters played their parts very well. Agent 47 was cold and mysterious (not to mention, very very lethal). Although there was some goofy dialog (especially from nika). I would recommend this to any action buffs. I'm tired of seeing movies like this getting such bad scores from pro critics. Its just a fun romp you don't have to think much about to enjoy.

He said they were tired of the same watered down crap of Hollywood and video game movies and they wanted something that expanded the genre etc.anyway...on a general level this movie is entertaining. if you came to see a movie along the lines of underworld then look no further. but this movie has little to no depth.

335,stephan1000,Impeccable,9,16 June 2008,"To begin with, this movie is one of the best movies ever made in a very quality demanding era. It is both entertaining and realistic. The first time I watched it I love it so much that I had to watch it again and then the next day too.The movie is about an assassin named 47 or Agent 47 who is pursued by the international police organisation Interpol mainly because of his several assassinations across the world and when he got to Russia and assasinated the country's president was also pursued by the Russian secret service FSB. Well the way he got out of his arrest was well thought of and funny.Technically and realistically I give the directors and editors a B+ for the sequencing and programming of the scenes. The way the actor Timothy Olyphant carries himself is impeccable even better than most highly popular actors in action and thriller roles. Nobody could act this movie better than him; many movie fans and critics I've talked to rate him the highest in this genre at the moment. I just thought that the starting soundtrack ""ave maria"" should have been used in at least two mellow mood scenes that would continue that intense Eastern European ambiance. Nevertheless the other soundtracks played their roles.The beginning of the film is very much on point with all the motions and the special effects. The motions in the shooting incidents are entertaining and fitting for modern film programming.What makes the movie great is it's complexity and deep story nature which actually comes out of a rather simple and common type of scenario. If you want to watch a thoughtful, entertaining, action packed movie but have not seen Hit-man; starring Timothy Olyphant then go look for this movie right now. I rate it a 9 out of 10 in it's genre and an 8.5 out of 10 overall.Simply a must see.",Hitman

Not a perfect adaptation, but the best so far compared to others out there. Though Jason Statham was my initial bet, Timothy Olyphant did a good job with portraying Agent 47.Aspects of the game was incorporated in the movie and they didn't overkill with stupid ideas. Action was pretty good and I like the fight scenes. Agent 47 in the movie does live up to his cold killer reputation in spite of a girl being introduced.

Is the video game as bad as the movie? Maybe explains why the story was totally thin, stiff, and fidgety like the hit man. Can't the studios and writers come up with their own stories? How long has the industry been around? Surely the content should be better by now, or at least quality control!?

If you have expected a movie that represents the video game, you got all wrong.Hit-man is a good action movie : there are explosions, violence, a nude girl, blood, SWAT and stunts. In my opinion, it is better than ""The Bourne Identity"". There are some great ideas in the movie. For example, when Codename 47 snipes the Russian president, we see the action through the scope of his sniper rifle. Also, there is a scene when the girl gets undressed, but instead of having a good time with her, Codename 47 hits her behind her ear and she falls unconscious. These are example of things which are atypical in action movies.I was lucky enough to win tickets for the advance screening of the movie. In the cinema, the crowd had a great feeling about the movie.

Even as far as action movies go the characters are impressively shallow; most have no distinguishable motives or personalities and just to ice the cake the director decided to throw in some Russian stereotypes that would have been corny in a James Bond flick. The acting itself ranges from bad to Keanu Reeves and in the case of the protagonist the quality entirely contradicts the intended image of the character: ""My ability to plan and execute complex tasks and predict even the smallest eventuality borders on prescience yet my grasp of the English language and social skills would leave me floundering in a high school language arts course, of course despite all of this I have women falling all over me.""

During the movie I wasn't drawn into comparing the movie to the game, either you played the game or not, I think there is something here for all the die hard fans, and your high octane action movie buffs.

A friend commented after the movie that it was so short, just above an hour and a half. The time missing from the movie was the plot development. Many connections in the movie were simply played off with a one line comment, then moving to the next scene, hardly interesting.Bottom line, good action film, had the potential to be much much more, but its not.

But I afraid that I can't agree with any of those... To start with, every single aspect of this movie looks unfinished. I mean, it looks like nobody bothered themselves with gathering even basic information about the background and cultural aspects of the countries the actual movie is supposed to take place in, not to mention all the factual errors and an absolutely unrealistic use of firearms. Now I think I hear someone saying that the movie isn't supposed to be a documentary, but a good action. Let's see... I don't know about the others, but I could tell the ending after just five minutes of watching, so the dose of actual fun from the movie was then depending on so-called action scenes, which were quite interesting, but I had a strong feeling that I've already seen all of them somewhere else. But well, I have to admit the truth, that wasn't bad in general, even though, as I already mentioned before, absolutely unrealistic. Now I'd like to move onto my favourite part called 'acting'... which was extremely poor... Not even Mr. 47 looked and moved like a broken robot from one of those low-budget sci-fi movies dated late 60's, rather than like a trained assassin who controls every single muscle in his body, but he didn't even looked as a man who can actually hit someone without starting to cry... I'm not going to talk about the other characters because it is impossible to refer to the things they've done on the screen as 'acting'... If its all that bad, why is it 5 stars then? This is the first successful movie based on a computer game, that's why. Even though Hit-man is a movie of a poor quality, it easily beats all the Mr. Ball's so-called 'creations'. So, what do we have? As a movie Hit-man is worthless, but if you're a fan of the game, I'd obviously recommend to at least take a look at it.",Hitman
348,asforce,This is a show for fans of 47 to enjoy but not for great entertainment,6,27 November 2007,"I set out watching this show to see how the producers will screw it up. The verdict? Well they almost had me jumping my ass off a few time. First was the voice of Diana, they had to computerize it which was horrible by the way. But in the end, the real voice of Diana got be back to the seat with a smile. Next was them showing 47 almost seduced, which ended with him knocking Nika out with his classic sedative and walked off. Almost got me but in the end, a nice 47 styled method of getting things done.Most of 47's favored weapons was shown, his iconic Silverballers, walther w2000 and his syringes. His execution of assassination was close how a player will do it in game for some parts,an example will be planting the piston before hand at the cubicle and spiking the drink. There was also a few scene which in my opinion to be replicated from some scene in the games series, pretty neat i will say.So the producer did not made a big blunder of themselves, which is good. But as a film, it lacks a lot of quality to it. Lots of explanation was not really done well , like the origin of 47 was not complete. The background of IAC,and i rather they show more relationship of 47 and Diana. The plot was not really running well, you don't really get the on your edge feeling you get from other super agent films like Bourne, his skill execution was too little. More should be shown how he archive his objectives.In conclusion, as fans of hit-man you get to enjoy seeing 47 in action on the big screen without pulling your hair off trying to think of the perfect assassination. As for normal movie fans who wants to get a peek on what hit-man is about, let just say its will not be the best you have seen but it is a best game adapted movie i have seen so far...",Hitman
349,captinmorgan1836,Can I vote past 10?,10,29 November 2007,"I attempted to play the game and I horribly failed, but I insisted on watching people who could play, play the game. I fell in love with Agent 47 for his hard core qualities. Even as a game the character pulled off a very sexy, very mysterious, very violent facade. I had no idea that Hit-man was going to become a movie until one day in the theater when there was a preview for it- more of a teaser. I couldn't wait! Later on in the fall the trailer came out and I saw Timothy Olyphant as Hit-man and I was so excited! He looked just like what I would have expected 47 to look like in real life. Not to mention, as a female fan it's nice to see a strapping young man as your action star! At that point I thought that the movie could have gone only one of two ways- GREAT or HORRIBLE. Especially when you put such a good looking actor in the main character- sometimes directors will make it so that it's showcasing him instead of the character they are portraying. I especially liked that he didn't talk much. Left more to the imagination as to what 47 was really thinking. I also really liked his interaction with Nika. I thought that was hilarious. I may have been one of the only people actually laughing out loud at things he said or did to her! Two things were exceptionally funny- the trunk part and the part where she tried to seduce him! I laughed hysterically. I also liked how the whole thing panned out. I hope there are more of these movies, especially seeing as there is something deep going on in him because of Nika, after all, the ending of the movie says it all. Over all this was one of my favorite movies to date- and my favorite action movie. Watch out James Bond, his name is 47, Agent 47!",Hitman
350,vasco-a-horta,A bit far from the game,7,8 December 2007,"The missions were too fast, so we could only watch the time he kills, but not the preparations,like getting a disguise, infiltrating in the places, avoiding cameras or security...the usual things we have to do in the game. Another con is the scenario monotony, as all the movie takes place in Russia. The soundtrack wasn't anything special or new, the main title was from Hit-man Blood Money. But, although the small use of stealth technics which are the head of Hit-man's icon , the movie could greatly recreate 47's character. Hit-man gets in love with a girl which never happens in the games, but as usual in an action movie, the main character has always his girlHe shouldn't has escape from Interpol so easily and in Hit-man Blood Money the agency ends. It is never said in the games that he works for CIA.",Hitman

The where a few cons like:1) The plot was kinda cliché, almost same like the movie shooter. 2) The other agents didn't look like him, while the game they were clones. 3) The film was to short and there was not enough bloodshed. 4) 47 was not so coldheartted as the trailer said he was And here are the pros:1) It is good to see the hard/silverballers back and the fibrewire. 2) The movie did't ruined the game character.Well there is much more but i can't say because they may contain spoilers.And so it kicked butt, i highly recommend to see that movie.",Hitman
352,sebbetta-1,This movie hits the spot,9,30 November 2007,"Well, I hoped it would be a really good film, and it didn't disappoint me :) All of the Hit-man video game fans should enjoy this movie, since the plot and locations involved in this film are very similar to those shown in the game. There are some themes from the game that are introduced with a witty sense of humor :D Timothy Olyphant did an outstanding job in impersonating The Agent 47;I mean mainly: the mannerism, facial expressions, close combat skills, and his coolness. The level of his acquaintance with various sorts of weaponry, matches that one in the game. The music in the film totally amazed me :) I loved it. However, there was something missing in this movie..... . In general,this film took a fancy to me. I'm looking forward to seeing it again.",Hitman
353,smallbee,I also think the movie is more than great!!!,10,1 December 2007,"Hey, I really loved the movie! I have never heard or played the game but I can tell the movie is amazing!The characters are perfect and I like them... Some people do not like that there is some nudity during the movie but that is not that much of a deal...just get over it!! Timothy Olymphant is just perfect for that role-Agent 47 and he does a great job!The girl is also cute who cares that she shows some skin in the movie...I don't think that this makes the movie look bad but just the opposite. I recommend the movie to people who enjoy action and have no problems with some sort of a little nudity. Don't be so conservative people!This is just a movie but a good one...check it out...I believe you'll like it...Have fun!!!!",Hitman

As I briefly saw in the video game, this guy looks like the real agent 47. Nika Boronina is simply awesome and terribly sexy, so there's no problem on this side.The problem is, and always will be in video games adaptations, the script. God it's BORING!!! I mean, an unoriginal story with one of the most predictable endings. I have to admit that it got some cool action scenes, but man...that sucks...But OK... Many peeps say that we have to play the game to understand some little things and insides and blah blah blah... So hey! If you're like me and didn't play the game but still really wanna see it, just rent all the Hit-man's games and you'll probably enjoy the movie, otherwise, don't go see this sh**...",Hitman

Timothy elephant actually plays the character very well (to my surprise) If you have ever played any of these hit-man games, OH boy does this movie do it justice, there's a lot of references to the games and a lot of the coolness found in the games. I you newer played any of the hit-man games, well then maybe the movie will get a lower score (7-8) but if you (Like me) played the hit-man games, then you'll notice a lot of things familiar in the movie and absolute dig it!

356,tuksta,"Great film,",8,6 December 2007,"I went to see this film mainly on the basis that i love the computer games and i was impressed by the generally good reviews on this website. Thankfully, i was not disappointed, as what i got was a top class action movie. Plot-wise its not on par with the Bourne series but, who cares? This movie was made to be loud, violent, sexy and cool, basically a treat for all blokes. Apparently it also has some draw for women, my girlfriend told me after the film, in Timothy Olyphant and his ""dreamy eyes"". I myself was unsure whether he would be suited to the role of 47 but, i was pleasantly surprised. He was very convincing as the old cue ball himself, even portraying well how 47 only kills when necessary and shows little enjoyment of the act. i say when necessary but obviously that means a lot, and i like the fact that no holds were barred when it came to 47 carrying out his job, unlike other ""hollywood"" movies where they show remorse etc. One thing about the film was the amount of times peoples voices were dubbed. I have a good eye for these things and i found it to occur quite often and it made me cringe a bit each time. Surely the actors where saying the right lines!?! Also, if a character is going to be completely dubbed over, what was the point of having him in the first place!!! All in all i loved it and if you're a manly man full of testosterone or even if you just like a bit of action, go see this movie.",Hitman

358,Exile6,Hit-man is NOT supposed to be a thrilling new movie!,8,6 December 2007,"OK for you people who expected Hit-man to be a thrilling, new, awesome, ass hard killing movie need to understand that the Hit-man movie is just a bit taken out of the Hit-man games. The movie clearly shows what the games SHOW. A man dressed in black called 47, takes jobs to assassinate people any way the client wants him to. If you expected any more of the Hit-man movie, you never clearly played any of the games. For those who say the movie has no character introduction, no interesting plot, and is predictable, you have no idea where the original idea came from.The movie is basically MISSION based in the Hit-man games, but made into a movie kinda feel where every detail has to be followed with another. If you played the games, which the MAIN IDEA of the Hit-man movie came from, you would UNDERSTAND why there are no character introductions, not a really interesting plot, and why the movie is so predictable. People who NEVER played the game will most certainly think ""what the hell was that"". For me, the movie is just another day of playing the Hit-man series, but with no controls. I can actually sit back and watch it instead of playing it. THAT is why the movie is mostly attracting to the people who played the game.Now down to the actors of the movie. Timothy Olyphant is a OK role that played Agent 47. His facial features are worse than what I expected of a actor for 47. Agent 47 has that manly no expression, stiff look while Timothy Olyphant has that baby kind of innocent facial feature. In the movie you WILL see him have that look of Agent 47 but when you put him close enough to the camera, its just Timothy Olyphant, not a silent, manly killing machine agent 47 is. Now everyone understands faces in real life cannot copy modeling faces of a video game. That is why I will not resent Timothy Olyphant the role of Agent 47 even though there probably could be other actors that could match him better. Olga Kurylenko is a good role for a kind of ""hello"" to agent 47 character. Even though Agent 47 has no particular social involvement with anyone other than when killing them, not everything is expected to be copied from the games to the movies, right? To close the deal, if you liked the games you will like the movie. If you didn't like the games, you aren't going to like the movie. And if you are a newcomer to Hit-man series, it will depend on you what you think about the movie. Remember movies are to entertain the public, depending on which public the movie attracts.",Hitman
359,markruffley,"If you're a fan of the game, you must read this!",5,29 December 2007,"In short, very disappointing.If, like I was, you are expecting a film based on the game, you're in for a disappointment. To say that the film is based loosely on 47's character would be an overstatement. Names, places and even the history of where 47 came from have been altered. Why? I can only assume it's because Skip Woods has never been anywhere near the game and was employed to write the script by the studio because he gave the cheapest quote. If you are a big fan of the game, again like me, then I'm afraid there's a 100% chance that you won't be impressed by this charade.Thanks to Skip, his terrible plot and the completely unnecessary alteration of 47's past, I'm afraid there may be no chance of someone writing a more accurate sequel and rescuing what should already be, and which certainly had the potential of being, a fantastic adaptation.Shame on you Skip! On a more positive note, the action is good and, erm, I guess Timothy Olyphant does 47 justice in as good as a performance as he could give working from such a weak script. My hat is off to him, I had doubts that he would be able to pull off 47, but like I said, he does as good a job as anyone could have hoped given that the script is somewhat disastrous.",Hitman
360,serj_90,A very good movie!,9,10 December 2007,"Last Saturday I went to the nearest cinema with my friends to see this movie. I have been playing since two months at video-games Hit-man 2 and Blood Money, cause before I never played anyone of 'em. I thought it was going to be a bad movie, like many game-based pictures. But at the end I realized that Hit-man is a well-done work, a little ""masterpiece"" in its genre. Maybe who has never played the game cannot see some things that, in my opinion, are very similar with the game, like 47's walking style, the fighting technique, the explosive tricks he uses sometimes. In the whole this movie is suitable also for people who has never played the games, but, as said before, they cannot catch all the particulars. Congratulations to the director, who has managed to create a notable picture. (last thing: in the ""sex-scene"" we see 47 avoid the sexual rapport, according his not-human nature. Many of us first joked on him, but in the end we all see that it would be a bad idea to change radically the character's appearance)",Hitman
361,anti_christ_Sephiroth,Excellent.,8,12 December 2007,"Easily enjoyable. I admit it did contain a few corny scenes, but overall it was a great movie. A sexy girl, gunfire, and death? Pretty much all I could ask for in a movie that promises action and drama. It made me pay a strange amount of attention to everything around me: made me feel stronger walking around in my business suit, even though Agent 47 and I are in entirely different industries. Anyway, you cannot think of this movie as part of the game, and I can say that in this case especially for I have never played the games myself, merely watched them be played. Movies aren't meant to be the exact same. Overall I'd say the movie was clever and funny, action-packed and thought provoking.",Hitman

If i hadn't paid good money to see this i would have walked out within the first half hour.Terrible acting, terrible direction (admittedly the fight scenes were good), terrible sound dubbing. We were informed that St Petersburg was in Russia at least 5 times (MOST OF THE FILM TAKES PLACE IN ST. PETERSBURG!!!)This added to the general feeling that this ranks alongside Ultraviolet as one of the worst movies i have ever seen.If you have any sense of decency left in you, you will avoid this film at all costs.",Hitman
363,tstiemer,It was pretty cool..,7,13 December 2007,"Okay, let's face it.. Not many Video Game to Movie adaptations are successful, this movie JUST managed to dodge the bullet of becoming a flop.. In my opinion, Tim Olyphant's ""baby face"" rumors are true, Tim looked far from the 47 we know in the series, but then again David Bateson wouldn't do it justice either.. The first negative thing I heard of this movie was that they were watering it down to PG-13, if this movie WAS watered down, which it isn't.. It would of Definitely be a flop, I liked this movie, I got a few laughs and some good entertainment.. I wouldn't recommend this to fans, it isn't that true the game..",Hitman
364,im14,Aboslutely horrible,1,14 December 2007,"I give this movie a 1 out of 10 for several reasons.First the actor. If any of you who saw this movie played the game ""hitman"", any of its sequels, you would know who the Hit-man is and how he acts. The dry (and possibly unintentional)humor is something that would never happen with Agent 47 otherwise. He would never have some kind of a-la-samurai showdowns with anyone, and he would most definitely lack any socializing skills whatsoever. All the one-liners, all the intense gunfights are just way over the top. If the game focused on planning and perfect execution, why make it an absolute mess in the film? I digress a bit, but this leads to the storyline. It's completely made up with no reference to the actual game whatsoever, and I strongly doubt the creators of the movie ever listened to what Eidos (the software company that made ""Hit-man"") ever had to say about their script. So what is the point is making a movie that has no footing at all in the game's storyline, as far as the plot of the movie goes, is beyond me. I am not an expert in films, but since this movie did not appear in the cinemas where I live as most big titles do, it rightfully deserves to be called an expensive B movie that would only be entertaining to teens or children. I had to actually FORCE myself to watch it till the end, that's how bad it is. The special effects are cheap, the whole movie has some kind of ""get it filmed already"" thing about it, and I just feel sorry who spent their money at the cinemas watching this.Fortunately such talentless scriptwriters and directors that make these kind of absolute failures have no power over the game designers, if anyone out there wants to see how addictive and rich the game's storyline is, try all Hit-man games from 2 to 4 (1 is just way too old). But if you want a good movie in this genre, watch Leon or Matrix. Both fit their own niche, both enjoyable, much unlike ""hitman"" the movie.In all, the movie is the pinnacle or storyline ignorance, and some kind of self-centeredness of the director. But Eidos probably went along for the whole thing because of the advertisement they get from it.",Hitman
365,ouch-13,Totally unexpected,1,15 December 2007,"To start with this movie is a game adaptation and it has it's limits witch in my opinion had not been reached. This peace of work should not be compared by any way with The Bourne it lacks everything that Bourne has. I'm saying this because I was expecting just that and it was a total turn off. Scene after scene I knew what was going to happen next, combined with boring and predictable conversation's made it even worse. The action scenes and camera shots have been used in 10 thousands of different movies and if you have seen few of them this movie will seem like a constant deja vu. Director of this movie Xavier Gens was trainee assistant director for Hark Tsui while he was directing ""Double Team"" to refresh your memory thats the movie where Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dennis Rodman fight international crime.The acting it self is pretty good but to be honest that is not something you are worried about when choosing action movie to watch. Hit-man him self looks good and dark in his outfit and resembles his game self witch is kinda nice to see ,I guess it's more important to everyone who played the game.After seeing it I was happy that it was over. If you really wanna go to the cinema to see this make sure to bring huge amount of pop-corns ,coke and friend just in case.",Hitman
366,ideming,Stays fun to watch while also it tells a good story,8,16 December 2007,"It came as no surprise to me that the critics are killing this movie. They always kill this kind of movie, and even more so if it's a video-game turned movie. I'm going to have to disagree. Now this movie was pretty fun to watch. It's not like Shoot 'Em Up, which was actually supposed to be a completely ridiculous, this one tried to be serious but it didn't work. I didn't mind. It not only made this movie more entertaining, but the quality of the rest of the movie more than made up for that.Hit-man was good because it wasn't just a dumb movie with basically no story, it actually tries to tell a story while staying action-packed and entertaining, and it definitely succeeds with this. Speaking of action, Hit-man doesn't really have any action. It has HYPER action. There are helicopters, gunfights, fist fights, and chases of every different kind, not to mention a censored sword fight.Hit-man moves along at a very fast pace, and it definitely works for this kind of movie. The casting is great. Timothy Olyphant is a great actor and I thought he was a good choice for this role. The rest of the cast is fine, nothing outstanding but they get the job done.Overall, this movie was definitely worth my while. It's biggest strength was staying very entertaining but also staying fun to watch. If you're a fan of action, then definitely see this movie. It's good.",Hitman

To me, it was just an action movie ... And a really good one at it! Loved the story build-up ... And the way the plot thickens ... Starting all the way from the hit of a Russian president to the involvement of Interpol, FSB, CIA, the president's brother and finally the president again! The action sequences were disturbingly pleasing! From the 4km shot, bathroom sequence, the escape from hotel to the fight at the train. And the beauty of these sequences are that they are complemented by detailed planning by 47.There were quite a few very intelligent moments. Notably, when 47 (Olymphant) holds the gun to shoot the witness (Olga) but decides against it after seeing no reaction on her face! Brief nudity, no kiss but wonderful on screen chemistry between Olga & Olymphant; reinforced by subtle but cheesy dialogs like, keep quiet or i will put you back on the trunk (47, at breakfast), do we have time for foreplay? (nika, in the car), it is not polite to stare (nika, at hotel, Istanbul).Now comes the part of acting! I thought all the major characters pulled off a better than decent job, with Olymphant playing a fitting tough, polite and cool agent 47. If wanted to watch good acting ... I would probably see Atonement or Frida! Here's a thought, when was the last time you wanted to watch an action movie for phenomenal acting! Most importantly, the action sequences are staged ""every 7-to-10 minutes"" to keep the audience excited! 9-out-of-10 for an good & entertaining 90 minutes!",Hitman

Being a big fan of the Hit-man games, I was fairly worried when I heard that they were going to make a movie based on it because movies based on video games don't tend to be very good movies...But after seeing it last night, I must say I was pleasantly surprised. It was actually quite a good movie. It may not win an Oscar or anything, but it's amazing to see Agent 47 up on the big screen. Timothy Olyphant does a surprisingly good job of portraying him too.The love interest is a bit awkward to anyone who knows Agent 47's nearly complete lack of emotion in that department, but despite what the trailer may lead you to expect, it really doesn't go very far outside of what you've come to know in the games (and what happens when she tries to seduce him is absolutely hilarious and very much in the Agent 47 tradition).It is indeed a violent movie, and 47 is as cold-blooded as you'd expect him to be. Seeing it tends to make me wish other movie heroes had the same level of guts, just to shoot the bad guy in the face instead of letting him live or anything silly like that. The fight scenes with the other assassins from the Agency are also very well done and quite a treat to see.",Hitman

And how he works - his rating would be a ""deranged killer"" or something. There was only one attempt to make an assassination smoothly - even that one he messed up turning it to another massacre.

371,alaztair,'Special',1,26 January 2008,"NOTE TO READERS: Normally I don't bother writing reviews for movies, largely because I'm too lazy and I figure that no one is likely to be interested in my opinion anyway. So when I DO actually make the effort, I'll have you know that the movie must have 'moved' me or be especially 'special'. Hit-man is one of these movies.Hit-man can be described as many things: a love story, an action-packed thriller or even a tale of redemption and overcoming one's demons. However, perhaps the best way to describe this video-game adaption is 'low budget Asian p0rn0' because the only good scene in the entire film was when the random Asian actor chick walked topless from her bed to the balcony.The movie enters 'self-destruct' mode from the very outset as Agent 47 (a cold blooded assassin without a conscience, programmed to kill from birth read: NO EMOTIONS) goes completely against his character and begins to develop an EMOTIONAL attachment to the random Asian chick (a wh0re) who he has kidnapped for intelligence reasons (wasn't really paying much attention even at this point). The situation deteriorates further when toward the end of what can only be described as an awful film the Asian chick and 47 have a teary farewell even though they probably conversed for no more than 1 minute throughout the entire movie. One would expect such a farewell in a drama or 'chick flick', (between a married couple perhaps) not in a damn thriller/action movie! Other points of interest (spoilers... kinda, but not really...): - There is a terrible fight scene. With swords. Under trains.There is an awful DIRECT VISUAL REFERENCE to the Video-game 'Hitman' with is done in such a manner that it can almost be regarded as advertising (this is what prompted me to write this critical review): Agent 47 bursts into a hotel room through a window (as you do) and there are 3 kids playing a game console. The camera switches to the TV screen and (lo and behold!) a digitized version of Agent 47 is on the screen toting a sniper rifle! The kids do a double-take (it's that bad) and stare open-mouthed at the 'real-life' 47 who (I swear!) winks at them* and continues running from his pursuers. AWFUL.BAD MOVIE: DO NOT WATCH. DO NOT HIRE. JUST DON'T.* I added the 'wink' bit in, but seriously... it's all of what was required to make the scene assume an 'advertisement'-like quality. TERRIBLE.Lucky to get...

372,avengerofdarkness,Fun Action Movie - Don't Expect Anything Else,7,27 January 2008,"This is one of the best video game adaptations I've ever seen. Timothy Oliphant did a nice job portraying Agent 47, and although sometimes he shows a humanity which doesn't appear in the video game, it didn't differ much from the actual game. However, I noticed a few things which have been altered :1) The other hit men were orphans : In the game, they are all clones, which means they should all be played by Timothy. But it's difficult to film a fight between four clones of the same guy, so it's okay.2) The fight in the train : I'm sorry to say this but this was one of the most pathetic action scenes I've ever seen. Agent 47 walks into a wagon, as 3 more Hit men come his way. They all point their guns at each other, and 47 says ""What about dying with some dignity?"". Everyone nods (the part where he looks at all three made me laugh) so they all pull out their swords and start killing each other. Excuse me, but since when does Agent 47 want to kill people with dignity? He could've easily dispatched all three of 'em but he chose the risky method.3) The Chick : Yes, I know this kind of films need some nudity but they could've tried to show it some other way. If there was a Hit-man game with missions based on the movie, the briefing would say : Kill Nika Boronia, and you wouldn't be able to finish the game until you kill her. Agent 47 kills every single one of his targets, that's what we learned from the video game series.",Hitman

I didn't get to see it in the theaters, which now having actually seen the movie, I regret. Hit-man was definitely the big surprise adaptation this year. I was intrigued, as I never really got into the game that deep, and figured I'd give it a shot, first making sure that Boll had nothing to do with the movie. I was very pleasantly surprised by the movie. There was a minimum of overused one-liners, which can be hard for a movie like this. I was then surprised to find that Agent 47 was played by Timothy Olyphant, also known for his work in ""The Girl Next Door"" and ""Catch and Release"" (along with Kevin Smith, the demagogueso sexy). With a clean shaved head, Olyphant is almost unrecognizable. It seems that the writers and director actually took the making of this film seriously. There was even a sort of homage to the video game itself, though it was done with absolute tact and was not overplayed. Overall, I found that Hit-man is by far my favorite VG adaptation to date; granted it's followed by Doom, but I don't have much to work with on account of the scrotum Uwe Boll.",Hitman
374,isaac-92,"Crap, crap and more crap",1,3 July 2008,"To start off this movie is almost impossible to follow. They try to tell the story in a smiler fashion to the Bourne movies but to no avail. Hit-man himself is not very likable he just looks like any other agent with a gun. I can't see why we are supposed to like him anymore then his opponents? The movie then goes off into a frenzy of guns rockets and whatever Hit-man can get his hands on. But with no real plot it seems like a turkey shoot em bang bang movie. The only problem is that the story is told in a serious tone which takes even the little fun of a gun crazy movie like ""Shoot Em up"". I've played the video game and really liked it. That is why it is so disappointing to see the movie turn out like this.",Hitman

It tries hard to compare to the likes of Bond and Mission Impossible but falls a long way short of the mark. The plot is not nearly complex enough and if it was aiming to impress with stunts and action then the producers should have though far longer and harder about this. This film would have benefited from A-list cast, but then again the script probably drove anybody with a half decent reputation in the industry about 10 miles in the opposite direction of this film. This is a film that I will probably never watch again. THere really is nothing to write home about with this film. A half-baked attempt which fails to deliver on so many levels.",Hitman

Anyone who is searching for an all around realistic movie: you will NOT find it with Hit-man.Close to the start of the movie, Agent 47--Timothy Olyphant--is hired to assassinate an important political figure. It is in this scene that a reality check should take place. In the film, the government reviews the assassination and determines that the shot was placed from over 4 kilometers away--an impossible shot for near any rifle--not to mention shooter. It is things like this that ""push my buttons.""Throughout the whole movie, things of this nature recurred.

For instance when the inspector was getting told to lay off and leave it to the FSB to handle the situation, the inspectors voice and lips didn't match up, so his voice went ahead of his voice.Then after the inspector apprehend the hit-man, those ""agent"" stop the inspectors car, everyone gets out of the car and I notice that the wasn't a hit-man in the car when the guard that were sitting beside the hit-man got out to protect the inspector( this was before the US agent points out that he's gone)Also when 47 protects the girl from getting shot @ the end of the move it shows him looking down from a rooftop, the sun it the frame with the girl walk is a totally different direction the the frames with 47 in them.

The two main characters Timothy Olyphant (Agent 47) and the beautiful Olga Kurylenko (Nika Boronia) do a sterling job of making the film the entertaining piece that it is.

It is the difference between reading Romeo and Juliet and seeing the movie.I just can't believe that the writers of the original story can sleep at night after seeing their masterpiece abused in such a fashion.

Anybody who has played the games knows its all about stealth with Hit-man, but this movie is just all guns blazing all the time, what they should have done is taken Hit-man: Blood Money and made a movie out of the missions in the game, trying the make the perfect assassin,now that would have been good.Watch this for lots of action, and you won't be disappointed, Watch this for brains, and you will.",Hitman

The plot was ridiculous and so full of holes and continuity errors that i was left wondering if it started out a high school production, but then realised that if that was the case it would have been ten times better.

Every Good part of the Bourne films is taken away from it, brutalised and made bland and then put into the film. The part played by Oly is a good representation of agent 47. The acting is a bit over the top and corny but you can let that slide however the fact that the rest of the cast and it seems production crew were steadfast on creating a terrible version of the Bourne films killed it for me. The echoing Violins are the same, the characters are the same, the locations are even the same! NEVER have i seen such a bastardisation of a film in my life and i hope by reading my review that you will consider watching all the Bourne films and maybe even watch them one after the other and then follow with hit-man because i promise you will find Hit-man a disappointment in its menial comparison to The Bourne Trilogy.",Hitman

There is so much ""cheese"" out there in movie-land, especially when it comes to action movies, but this movie is a notch above the rest. I especially enjoyed the fight scenes - well choreographed. I also liked the hit-man's demeanor and intelligence. The scene where he fights 3 other hit-man is great - loved the way they all had guns pointed at each other, he suggests dieing with honor, and they all drop their guns and start fighting.

I've seen quite a few action/spy movies but there is something special about this one, especially the main character. Stylish and intelligent assassin 47 has cold and almost robotic movement throughout the movie and his focus of life is completing missions, killing targets. He doesn't seem to care which side he's working for, he only cares about how he completes his job without any mistakes. Timothy Olyphant did a wonderful job portraying agent 47, Before this movie I never knew who Timothy Olyphant was despite of the fact that I've seen him in several movies. I really enjoyed the directing of Xavier Gens who can shoot action scenes beautifully and elegantly. Olga Kurylenko played really well as a broken prostitute and she is extremely sexy.There's a downside though, story seems a bit faulty and lacks originality, I've felt quite a few times this doesn't make sense or have seen it somewhere (something like The Bourne identity). But action scenes look fantastic and remind me of Nikita from Luc Besson and John woo's movies.Overall I really enjoyed it because of the great cast and stylish directing, oh one more thing, the soundtracks are fantastic!",Hitman
392,idothefunkelectric,Gonna make this short and sweet...,3,3 June 2011,"Those who are expecting this to be true to the game series are going to be sadly let down.First of all, he talks way too much to be Agent 47. He also shows emotion at several points during the film, (a big fail there.) He picks up a chick along the way and lets her tag along (wtf?) He's not albino, he's just a guy with a shaved head. He encounters other hit men, but instead of being clones of him like they're supposed to be, they're just other guys of varying nationalities with shaved heads as well. I don't think he once even used any piano wire :/ This is just another pathetic example of a studio trying to cash in on a game series. They simply load it up with, sometimes over-the-top, violence and gore, spike it with some sexual tension, and call it a movie.The storyline itself was also pretty weak. If you ask me, they should have just brought in the story writers for the game to create a plot that wasn't completely washed up.Maybe it sounds like I'm being overly critical because I'm fond of the game series. Well of course I am, they're the ones putting the name on it, not me. They could have just as easily made a film about a hit-man that wasn't in any way related to the game series, but they didn't.

Posture and walking styles, excellent. Lighting and scenes, absolutely great. Carrying around a girl doesn't seems right I think. This movie also contain most of the killing skill that 47 had in the game (except the weaponless close combat) I was expecting a lower pitch of voice just like in the game, well actually to be exactly the same.

If you remember the games and the small things as just his voice, this is far away from the true game character.Further more, I don't think 47 is as delicate as he deserves to be. But I guess that in order to fit such a brilliant game into a blockbuster movie, 47 has to shoot his way through almost every demanding situation he gets in... which is a shame.If you remember the games, you had several ways to accomplish your tasks - one of the ways was to rush in and kill almost everyone. This is what the director had done when planning this movie. He ran in, took the best weapons available and killed everyone and thought ""Hell yeah, this is fun and violent - I like it!""

Every single scene in this movie has nothing to do with reality, from ""Russia"" filmed somewhere in Bulgaria to clothing and equipment of soldiers and officers. Director and editor work is terrible, but the guy who wrote the script should be probably executed several times. The behavior of main characters and the story itself is simply unbelievably unrealistic. Lord of the Rings movie is a serious documentary compared to Hit-man. ALL combat scenes are a terrible mix of action shots previously seen a hundred of times somewhere else. Not a single piece of unique atmosphere Hit-man game series used to have. And finally, if you guys call this acting, then I am William Shakespeare.I am an avid fan of Hit-man game series and I have a great advice for people who played the game: never, never, never watch this crap or you will be very disappointed.And if you like this movie then probably this is first movie you ever seen.",Hitman

Studios should have just called this film ""Dark Angel: The Movie"". At least Jessica Alba would have been easier on the eyes.I've never played the Hit-man games, and that's exactly the problem with video game movies. Viewers should not have to play the games in order to understand the plot of the movie. A film should be able to stand on its own merits. That's what video game fans are trying to tell Hollywood, but I guess they just don't get it.The movie starts off with some flashback sequences, or more like deleted scenes from ""Dark Angel"", of kids training, which there's no story background on, in what we are supposed to assume is some government operation.The Russian Government is looking for Hit-man 47, a number that is not even mentioned until ¾ into the movie. Why are they after 47? Who does 47 work for? Why is the girl that he protects so important? Do we get answers? No. Of course not.Supposedly the operation 47 works for ""doesn't exist"", so this is an excuse for the movie to overlook story and character development. People walk in and out of scenes for 30 seconds and we're supposed to remember their names. Throw in some nudity and mindless action and you have a 2 hour gold mine by today's standards. I'll admit it's a cool get rich quick device that has been tricking people for years into thinking they've seen a good movie.Even the action is mediocre, following in this recent trend of Bourne Identity & Batman Begins style fighting.

405,peterregiel,Unsurprising and expected...,3,7 December 2007,"Being a longtime fan of the games, I was pretty excited to hear that they were planning on making a film based on them. I knew that it would be a challenge to depict a rather 1-dimensional character like 47 in an honest and objective manner, while still making it entertaining for the public. That was when my optimism about this project faded; knowing Hollywood would take the easy way out, converting the rather complex and serious games into a very predictable and regurgitated action flick.Later in the year, I read the script that was floating around the internet. It confirmed all my predictions and I knew I was going to hate the movie. However, I am a glutton for punishment and I decided to see the movie yesterday, knowing well that I was going to end up with the stale taste of regret in my mouth.I think there are two aspects to look at here. The first is how the movie stands up compared to the game. The second is how the movie stands on its own as a film.To address the first point, I am utterly baffled by the reviews that state that this movie is faithful to the series and how it won't disappoint fans of the games. I can only conclude that these reviewers have never played the games, and know nothing about the back-story of the series. This movie is only related to the games by name, and the fact that there is a bald guy with a bar code on his head wearing a suit in it. The relation ends there.Olyphant's 47, portrayed as ¨cold¨ as Olyphant could muster, is warm and fuzzy (like Elmo) compared to the original Mr. 47. He jokes, he smiles, he awkwardly flirts with skimpy dressed Nika, and he spares the lives of our nice Interpol buddies. You don't have play the games for long to understand how this is a deviance from the original Hit-man concept. What really bothers me is that Olyphant's 47 destroys the fundamental concepts behind the Hit-man games, which are what have made that franchise so popular and unique: stealth, amorality, professionalism, moderation, restraint, and in a sense, non-violence. This movie doesn't remain faithful to any of that. It contains a bald guy shooting a bunch of dudes and saving a mistreated woman with a low tolerance for alcohol and a high tolerance for pain.The second point, whether the movie stands on its own or not, is fairly evident from what I have already mentioned. They could have named this ¨Die Hard Jr's Soviet Escapades¨ and no one would have been surprised. As an action flick, it follows the same formula that has been used for decades. Tough guy, weak chick, persecution, explosions, and gunshots. The action scenes are nothing special, but not terrible either. The plot isn't well put together, and some pieces don't make much sense. Little back story is presented about the characters, and I didn't feel any sympathy for any of them.Lastly, it appears that they dulled down the violence and edited out some of the background info from the script that I read. If the script was bad, a chopped up version of that script is an abomination.To summarize, this movie falls flat on its face as an action flick, and is an insult to the Hit-man franchise. The acting is relatively poor with miscast actors, a terrible script, mundane action scenes, and strung together plot elements. I had originally rated this film 4 out of 10, but all considered, it was lucky to end up with my 3 out of 10 rating.",Hitman

The details from the video game (The Silverballers, the disguises, the way 47 holds his guns, Ave Maria in the intro, etc) are all satisfying to see to the franchise's die-hard fans. Well done. Only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because there were one or two cringeworthy moments, but all is forgiven.",Hitman
407,stylez2,Your weekly dose of violence and coolness,10,13 December 2007,"Being aware of the quality of video game adaptions, at first i didn't really care about this movie. when i heard that timothy olyphant was to star in it i also didn't change my mind because i have only seen him in Live Free or Die Hard so far, and i wasn't impressed. however, after i read some previews and watched some trailers, i got excited and was eager to check this movie out, because i found out, it wasn't going to be your average PG-13 teen-action movie. so i gave it a try this evening and i was to say: i'm blown away. Agent 47 has all the coolness of Jason Bourne but he also has the balls and the cold-bloodedness of Leon.Action-wise there was nothing comparable i've seen this year. bloody gun and close combat fights, beautifully choreographed, a sexy lady, an OK plot and an excellent lead. After seeing Timothy Olyphant as Agent 47, you wouldn't even wanna think about Vin Diesel for a second. He might be a bit younger than Mr. 47 from the games, but who cares. His emotionless and cold-blooded behavior is as authentic as it gets. Even though he isn't really the hero you'd think about, this might just be what is so fascinating about him. When he shoots people point blank in the head, just because it's his job or they are in his way, you cant help but to think ""yeah, finally someone who does what it takes!"".in a nut shell, this movie is much above average in the video game genre and even if you have no clue about the game you will still enjoy timothy olyphant's performance and the style of the movie. for guys like me, it's the weekly dose of violence and coolness.",Hitman
408,CrustyDOD,Best movie based on game so far,6,24 January 2008,"Timothy Olyphant did a great job on being agent 47 like we know it from the game. His acting was quite good. The story itself could have been a lot better. Overall the best but not perfect movie that is based on game! The thing that bothered me is that the point of hit-man ""agent 47"" is to be silent assassin and not Rambo! That's where they made a mistake. Agent 47 is NOT Rambo, he is SILLENT assassin where he kills his targets without anyone finding out that he was the killer. Way too much killing... It just destroys the point of a true hit-man known from the games. People who did this movie should watch Bourne's movies and not Rambo on how to do assassin types of movie.Give it 6/10 cause of the above thing that really bothered me.",Hitman
