0,MartinHafer,this movie proves you can't go back,3,4 July 2005,"This is a terribly uninteresting movie and it's amazing that after a dozen year absence as Bond, Sean Connery would pick THIS picture for a comeback. They must have offered him TONS of $$--no other explanation makes sense. The biggest problem is that instead of creating a movie for Connery, they just chose to re-make one of Connery's previous Bond films! Why not something new instead of a second-rate remake of a film he already did?! Well, it turns out the studio could NOT get the rights to Bond, though, because of a loophole, they could legally re-make Thunderball! This is a rotten excuse to make the film.Apart from the beautiful Kim Basinger, there is nothing about this movie that makes it better than the original (THUNDERBALL)--in fact, the original is so much better. Because of this, it seems like the makers of the film had contempt for the audience--they didn't even bother giving them something new! Particularly uninteresting is the character played by Barbara Carrera, though Klaus Maria Brandaur isn't much of a villain as well.My biggest feeling is WHY--Why was this film made in the first place?!",Never Say Never Again
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Sean Connery, welcome back!",8,25 August 2010,"As I have said before, I love James Bond, and the Sean Connery Bonds are some of my favourites of the franchise. Never Say Never Again is not the best Bond, but it was very solid on the whole and was a welcome return for the master of suavity and charisma Sean Connery. The plot is a tad bloated and lurches badly at times, but there is much to enjoy. Even after a twelve year absence, Connery is a great presence and provides a perfect balance of comedy and authenticity. The costumes, cinematography and scenery are suitably lavish, the set pieces and action are very well done and the music (score and theme song combined) is excellent. Max Von Sydow, Barbera Carrera and Klaus Maria Brandauer are wonderful to watch, as is Kim Bassinger, while the script is smart and arch. I especially loved Q's remark about gratuitous sex and violence. In conclusion, a solid Bond film, I was worried initially but I needn't be, the girls, locations and Connery were enough for me to enjoy it. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Never Say Never Again
2,bkoganbing,Playing Tag With Mr. Shark,7,26 December 2008,"I've always liked Sean Connery, but as James Bond I've always favored Roger Moore. Still it was Connery who set the Bond standard and while he had by 1983 established himself as something other than James Bond, the money must have been irresistible for him to make one more appearance as 007 and save the world from the evil designs of Spectre.And what designs they are in Never Say Never Again. SPECTRE with the help of a foolish young Air Force officer who happens to be Kim Bassinger's brother stole two nuclear missiles during a war games exercise and now SPECTRE headed by Blofeld, played here by Max Von Sydow is threatening blackmail of the world.Von Sydow's operations guy is Klaus Maria Brandauer who is also courting Bassinger and is a bit on the crazy side. And he's got a female assassin working for him in Barbara Carrera who makes Angelina Jolie as Nora Croft look like Mrs. Butterworth.But before Sean Connery can even get started he's got to deal with a new 'M' running things at British Intelligence. Edward Fox thinks Connery is old fashioned in his methods and costs the British taxpayers too much money with his violent ways. I really did enjoy Fox's performance, he's like the great grandson of Colonel Blimp.I also enjoyed Carrera, she's something to look at and quite resourceful in her methods. When she's scuba diving with Connery in the Bahamas, note how she puts Mr. Shark on 007's case.Will Connery do James Bond again? He was widely quoted as saying who would they cast him as at this point, Roger Moore's father? But I think Connery would still be formidable in a wheelchair.",Never Say Never Again
3,Leofwine_draca,"Not great, but not the worst",6,3 September 2016,"Being ""unofficial"" means that this entry in the Bond series has no returning cast members apart from Sean Connery, but the mainstays (Moneypenny, M, Felix) are played by different actors which is somewhat confusing. The budget looks (not sure whether it IS, though) much lower than one of the Moore Bond films, with very poor back projection in the special effects sequences and some incredibly dated computer stuff in the form of a game in which two players launch warheads at each other and attempt to blow each other up. If somebody says that this is a highlight of the film, I have to say that the film is in big trouble!Connery is back, in his early 50s by this time, noticeably slurring his words and wearing an incredible fake toupee. Well, it's sad to say that he STILL manages to upstage the rest of the cast but that isn't difficult when the villain is played by the miscast Klaus Maria Brandauer who acts more like a spoilt mummy's boy than a super villain. We also have the silly Barbara Carrera as a femme fatale who explodes after a gadget goes wrong, Kim Basinger as a highly forgettable Bond girl, and some other British mainstays like Rowan Atkinson, Valerie Leon, Anthony Sharp, and Edward Fox in supporting roles. None of them makes much of an impact.Weirdly, the film starts off brilliantly with a superb fight between Connery and Pat Roach, a hulking brute of a man. Their fight takes place in a country hospital and is greatly choreographed with lots of props and furniture being smashed up. That's the highlight of the film. The only other action takes the form of a motorbike chase (in which Connery's bike flies through the air at every opportunity) and some murky underwater shenanigans filmed by none other than Ricou Browning! The plot is the similar to that in THUNDERBALL and its easy to say which is the better film. The script is silly, but no more so than any other Bond film of the period, and the music is very bad. For an hour nothing happens in the way of action at all! A pointless, bland, boring Bond movie that makes me wish Connery could have just gone out on a high with DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER instead of lowering his status with this mild tosh.",Never Say Never Again
4,SnoopyStyle,love the video game,7,28 May 2015,James Bond 007 (Sean Connery) is suffering under the new M (Edward Fox) who keeps the double Os out of action and orders him to get rid of his 'free radicals'. SPECTRE Blofeld (Max von Sydow) and Maximillian Largo (Klaus Maria Brandauer) orders Fatima Blush to force Jack Petachi to steal nuclear weapons. Bond sees the suspicious meeting and is attacked. SPECTRE uses the weapons to extort NATO. Blush kills Petachi. The double Os are reactivated. Jack's sister Domino Petachi (Kim Basinger) is the possessive Maximillian Largo's girlfriend. Bond is joined by CIA Felix Leiter.This Bond movie is release a few months after Roger Moore's Octopussy. Connery is still sharp and has the rough edges that Moore simply doesn't have. The story meanders a bit as most Bond movies sometimes do. This is a throwback to the older Bond that is different than the slick campy Moore Bond. It has its moments like fighting with sharks and a good car chase. I really love the video game with Largo. That is the best part of the movie. The last act never gets to a big extravagant action sequence. It has a few cute touches like the personal rocket pads but it's simply not big enough. This is a nice throwback to a Connery Bond.,Never Say Never Again
5,Horst_In_Translation,"Connery's final turn is not among his finest, but still a success",6,23 June 2020,"""Never Say Never Again"" is a co-production between the United Kingdom, the United States of America and also West Germany, which is pretty unusual for a Bond movie. Then again, there is a great deal of discussion if this can be considered a real Bond movie, still after all these years. The main reason for that is that the Broccoli family is not involved here. Actually, this is almost the only reason. There are more reasons to say it is a valid Bond film. The biggest is probably that Bond is not only part of this movie, but even played by a certain Sean Connery, who makes his second return to the role and I am sure they got out the big bucks for this inclusion. The poster here on imdb says it all. The title is also clearly a reference to him appearing one final time as 007. And there is also here and there a minor reference about his comeback in the film itself, like when Q says something that he is glad Bond is back. So yes, Q is also in this film. So is M, so is Moneypenny. But of course, they are all played by other actors and not the usual from the traditional franchise. The one thing I had to think of repeatedly here is that those actors are much younger than their equivalents in the Broccoli franchise. Felix Leiter is in this film as well. And interestingly enough, he is played by a Black actor this time, just like he is a long time later with another actor playing Bond.This one here is from 1983, so it is getting closer to its 40th anniversary now. Connery was already in his early 50s at that point and you can see he is not a spring chicken anymore, even if I feel he also could have made it work in his 60s. This film is about five years older than Connery's Oscar-winning turn in ""The Untouchables"" and pay attention to how different he looks in both movies. What a difference his hair makes. Anyway, we shall speak about this one here now. There were many, many writers working on the screenplay here. I shall spare you the names as you can check those out for yourself. I do want to mention Emmy-nominated director Irvin Kershner though. I think he did a fine job overall, many interesting shots and angles in here.If you take a look at the cast, you will actually find some names that are even bigger than those you see in the official Bond movies. The best example is Klaus Maria Brandauer playing the main antagonist. It is not clear from the very beginning he is the villain because he does not have too much screen time early on and when we see him, he is more creepy in a pathetic way, like when he watches the girl at the gym, than really evil, even if his comment surely felt evil about what he is going to do with her if she leaves him. And of course she does eventually. It is not the first time that Bond manages to lure an attractive associate away from the main villain. This Bond girl is played by Kim Basinger, who was certainly not as big of a star back then as she was during her prime a couple years later, also with her Oscar win, but still far from unknown, even if I must say she is among the least memorable Bond girls for me if we are talking about those that get 007 in the end. However, the actress who really managed awards glory here was Barbara Carrera. She was nominated for a Golden Globe, but did not get in at the Oscars. Good choice probably. I mean she is good and shines especially in her final scene in which she is blown up by Bond and gets to show us her character's full insanity, but she really does not have the material to truly shine and justify such awards recognition. A surprising choice, even if without a doubt she is among the better, if not best, aspects this film has to offer.Another actor in here is Max von Sydow playing the legendary Blofeld. But while he is referenced a couple times, his character's impact is minimal, which is a pity because von Sydow is an actor who really could have turned this film into something special if he had been the main villain. Not that Brandauer is bad or anything. On the contrary, I think he did a fine job overall. His little computer game with Bond was certainly among the better moments of this pretty long 135-minute movie. Also really unusual to have a video game (well 1980s video game) in a Bond movie. The traditional franchise did not do anything like that, but it worked, especially with the little addition how they have to suffer physically while playing. Another sequence I enjoyed a lot was the lengthy one starring the late Pat Roach from relatively early on. May he rest in peace. Same goes out to von Sydow, who died relatively recently. I hope it will still be a long time until I say that about Connery. We will see. Anyway, what I wanted to say is that Roach's Lippe was definitely a scene stealer and one of the most memorable aspects of the film. Really physical stuff there between him and Connery.Of course, with Connery there is also always some solid humor and a few jokes that were not entirely harmless, but a bit sexual like when he askks one character if she likes it harder. Funnily, Moore asked the exact same thing (or was it Brosnan?) in another 007 film. Anyway, there was obviously no interruption for the Moore movies because of this one here. I think there was even one of Moore's later efforts that came out almost the exact same time. Same year or so. Not entirely sure about that. Back to Connery, the funniest moment for me was probably another joke from him, namely when he has to deal with Carrera's narcissistic character right before her death and is told to agree that she was the greatest woman he ever had in bed. That was bizarre stuff and I liked Bond's funny comment there (also provocative) that went something like ""well.. there was a little girl in"" etc. Was it Chicago? I am not sure, but it does not matter, but Connery's line delivery was brilliant there and I always thought he has also decent comedic talent. Please let him make it to 90. He was still younger than Moore by the way at that point, so you see how he left the franchise twice at a fairly young age, even if 50s are not something usual for Bond. Oh well, Craig is also older now, isn't he? There is a similar love-hate relationship with him and 007 now as there was with Connery and Bond.As for the title, this is also the name of the Bond song just like so many other times. The singer is Lani Hall. Probably not too many have heard of her, but she did a fine job I believe. She is also still alive today. One who is not is the legendary Michel Legrand, another really big name they hired for this daring project. The outcome is a film that from what I have read pleased critics more than regular viewers. But this is sometimes the case. Oh well, another thing I want to mention here is the truly unexpected inclusion of the young Rowan Atkinson (Blackadder, Mr. Bean). This was not the first time I watched this movie, but I did not remember him at all. He is a bit of a running gag here, also especially in the very last scene or when he keeps shouting Bond's name earlier. He was alright. Although probably back then almost nobody (maybe not even himself) would have expected what kind of a career he is going to have in the coming decades.Finally, I must still be a bit critical because I felt that the last third of the film was fairly bland and uninteresting. I believe they could have reached much better quality there given the characters and actors they had at their disposal. Not just the actual defusion, but also Bond dealing with the bad guy(s). And maybe he was a bit too heroic this time that it felt slightly unrealistic here and there. The underwater scenes were still nice. Interestingly enough, this film is a remake of ""Thunderball"" and the strange thing is that this already was a movie in which Connery starred, perhaps the one that received the least acclaim from his films, so I don't know, maybe they wanted to improve this time and show they are better than Broccoli. No clue. It's been a long time since I saw ""Thunderball"" and I don't remember much except Tiger Tom's chilling tune, but I would say the level is about the same quality-wise. Nothing great, but certainly worth watching. So I suppose you can go for this one, but you may want to check out Connery's classic turns as 007 before that, so basically every other film that has him play 007. Just watch chronologically and you are on the safe side I'd say. His swan song here gets a thumbs-up from me and I recommend checking it out.",Never Say Never Again
6,Prismark10,Like a thunderball,6,1 August 2013,"When Kevin McClory won the legal battle to remake Thunderball, he turned to the original 007, Sean Connery to return as Bond, older, greyer, with a bigger toupee and a nicer pay cheque.There is no hiding the fact that we have an out of shape Bond here, but the rest of the film is the same as Thunderball. Two American nuclear warheads are stolen by SPECTRE and they hold the world's governments to ransom by threatening to detonate them.Klaus Maria Brandauer is suitably chilling as Largo. At the time he would go on to be briefly one of the best character actors in the world.Barbara Carrera is sexy and gorgeous as Fatima Blush, the deadly villainess. Kim Basinger is the blonde Bond girl. She starts out as Largo's girlfriend and then realises that Largo may had been involved in her brother's death and helps Bond instead.Being an unofficial Bond film, there is no gunbarrel sequence, Bond theme and Felix Leiter is black, rather controversial at the time.Also the character Q, renamed here is more working class and supportive of Bond's fondness for sex and violence.However the film did suffer from not being an Eon production. It lacked the polish, the comforting feeling of the official films. Despite the various international locations it looked cheap here and there.It was an effective thriller with stunts, action and a few laughs with an older Bond. The producers sort of knew how lucky they were to get their hands on doing a Bond movie and were going to make the most of it.",Never Say Never Again
7,classicsoncall,"""I hope we're going to have some gratuitous sex and violence.""",7,3 January 2019,"This movie is called a remake of ""Thunderball"", but I saw that one just about a month ago, and except for the character names and the fact that two nuclear warheads were stolen by SPECTRE, it seemed to me to be a completely different story. I guess that's because if you watch the James Bond films in a relatively short span of time like I'm doing right now, a lot of the later ones borrow plot elements from earlier pictures, so they have a tendency to become somewhat redundant after a time. Quite shocking though was seeing how much Sean Connery aged in the twelve year hiatus from making his last Bond appearance. At fifty three years old, he's still got the charm and charisma of a younger Bond, but paired against the much younger starlets that appear here, something gets a bit lost in the translation.Still, the story has some fun moments, like the nurse's request for Bond to fill his specimen cup. I have to make a mental note to remember his response the next time I have my annual physical. Later on, Bond disables the monster thug by using that same urine sample, and though the idea is preposterous, it came across as credible in the story. At least as credible as anything else going on in a Bond film, because when you boil it all down, virtually all of them are beyond any semblance of believability.It's a tough call to make regarding who the most gorgeous Bond girl would have been throughout the half century series of pictures, but I think Kim Basinger would have to be somewhere near the top of the list. She and Connery had some nice turns on the dance floor and she managed to make the age difference with her co-star work fairly well, Too bad about Barbara Carrera though, that was just an ignominious way for Fatima Blush to exit the picture.Well without knowing what it took for Sean Connery to make a comeback as Double 0-7, I'd have to say he went out on a successful note. I think he and the film makers knew this was pretty much it as his final appearance in the series. All you have to do is watch Connery's sly wink at the conclusion of the picture when he goes into a clinch with Basinger, and manages to utter the word 'Never'. He didn't even have to say 'again'.",Never Say Never Again
8,gavin6942,Solid Bond Remake,7,19 December 2014,"A SPECTRE agent has stolen two American nuclear warheads, and James Bond must find their targets before they are detonated.How can you argue with the return of Sean Connery? Whether an official film or not, whether or not this Bond is now much older, you simply cannot beat Connery, and that is one of the reasons this is such a strong film despite the way it has been generally ignored.Kim Basinger as a Bond girl? An interesting choice, and definitely one of the actresses who would go on to bigger and better things. Some Bond girls are best known for that title... Basinger was so much more.Unlike the majority of Bond films, Never Say Never Again was not produced by Eon Productions, but by an independent production company, one of whose members was Kevin McClory, one of the original writers of the ""Thunderball"" storyline with Ian Fleming and Jack Whittingham. McClory retained the filming rights of the novel following a long legal battle dating from the 1960s... thus, the remake of ""Thunderball"" (updated for the 1980s).Max von Sydow appears briefly as Blofeld. Blofeld should only ever be Donald Pleasance, with all due respect to the great von Sydow. And, of course, we have the ""sexy scuba diving"" that seems to be a Bond staple.",Never Say Never Again
9,jboothmillard,Never Say Never Again,5,12 September 2005,"After 12 years away from the role, claiming that Diamonds Are Forever was his last outing, Sir Sean Connery decided to return a final time as the much loved secret agent in this pretty much self-parody adventure, from director Irvin Kershner (Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back). Following an updated plot of Thunderball, Bond (Connery), reactivated (from retirement or whatever) by M (Edward Fox), is up against the power of SPECTRE, run by the fearless Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Max Von Sydow). They have stolen two cruise missiles with the help of Agent Number 2, aka Maximilian Largo (Klaus Maria Brandauer), and they will explode large areas of the world with them unless paid a high ransom. So Bond, with a little help from Domino Petachi (Kim Basinger), sister of the pilot of the plan that carried the missiles pilot, is on the lookout for trouble and determined to stop the villains. The film ends with the world saved, Bond getting Domino, presumably retired, pushing pitiful British Consulate Nigel Small-Fawcett (Rowan Atkinson) in the pool, mistaking him for an assassin, and saying ""never again"" to returning as a spy? Also starring Golden Globe nominated Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush, Bernie Casey as Felix Leiter, Alec McCowen as Q 'Algy' Algernon, Pamela Salem as Miss Moneypenny and A Clockwork Orange's Anthony Sharp as Lord Ambrose. Released the same time as Octopussy, it was quite obvious not to do as well at the box office, and not being EON Productions (the official Bond makers), they couldn't use the gun barrel opening, the James Bond theme, the Aston Martin, the Walther PPK, the ""shaken not stirred"" line, and could only get one or two gadgets. Reusing the Thunderball storyline is quite lazy, the title song is dull, and Connery's British accent is faded. But I admit, I have judged this film a little harshly in the past, I originally gave it only two out of ten, but having watched it again, I actually got quite into it, there are some exciting action and chase sequences. I still don't like it as much as the real Bond films, but it's not bad. James Bond was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Sir Sean Connery was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 3 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and the film was number 19 on James Bond's Greatest Hits for Lani Hall's title song. Worth watching!",Never Say Never Again
10,ccthemovieman-1,"Decent, But Not As Good Has Hyped And Hoped",7,15 April 2006,"When I first saw this on tape, about 10 years after it had been released, I thought it was one of the better James Bond movies. However, after seeing it again around the turn of the century, I was disappointed.I think it's a bit overrated only because critics were so happy to see Sean Connery end his 12-year hiatus from playing Bond that they didn't dare criticize the film. I guess what disappointed me was the ending. After investing two hours into the film, you expect a less-hokey, more satisfying ending. And, it may be nitpicking, but I was disappointed in not seeing the regular actors in the supporting roles such as Miss Moneypenny, Q, Felix Leiter, etc.On the positive side, there was plenty of unique action scenes, particularly early on, and the two villains were interesting. I thought Klaus Maria Brandauer was the more intriguing of the two because he was so low-key and looked the ""nice guy next door."" He wasn't your normal Bond villain.This had plenty of ""skin,"" for a PG movie, especially with Kim Basinger starring, never being an actress known for hiding her figure. The language was very tame, but most Bond movies are pretty good in that department.All in all, it's a ""fair"" Bond and nothing else. Just because Connery is in it, it doesn't mean it's automatically good. Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan have proved they could play the role well, too.",Never Say Never Again
11,Tweekums,An okay return for Connery as Bond,7,1 November 2012,"This remake of 'Thunderball' sees Sean Connery return to the role that made him famous twelve years after his previous Bond film. There are some changes in this edition to update it from the sixties to the eighties; most notably rather than seizing control of a Vulcan bomber SPECTRE gets an agent, Jack Petachi, to switch the practice warheads in two cruise missiles to live nuclear weapons which SPECTRE member Maximilian Largo takes control of then attempts to blackmail the world. As chance would have it Bond was being treated as the same clinic as Petachi; this is the clue he needs to investigate the apparently clean Largo on a trail that leads from The Bahamas to the South of France to North Africa.This might be an 'unofficial' Bond film but it is still pretty good and apart from missing famous James Bond Theme and opening you could be excused for thinking this was part of the official series. Connery managed well in the roll despite being rather old for an action hero; he might not be as tough as in his earlier films but he still has a screen presence. The film's real weakness is that it compares poorly with Thunderball and in some ways seems more dated than original despite being made nearly twenty years later... the video game sequence suffers particularly in this regard. Other flaws include a sound track that is just not-Bond and a villain who seems too petty for a member of SPECTRE. All Bond films feature a variety of attractive women and this one is no exception; most notable are Barbara Carrera who plays psychotic SPECTRE agent Fatima Blush and Kim Basinger who plays Domino; Petachi's sister and Largo's lover; the former is memorably for her over the top performance as she prepares to dispatch Bond but the latter is a fairly forgettable character.Over all I'd say this is a decent film that certainly shouldn't be avoided by Bond purists; just don't expect anything as good as Thundball.",Never Say Never Again

13,BA_Harrison,"I suppose it's no worse than the official Bond film of the same year, Octopussy.",4,25 October 2012,"Bereft of a cool Maurice Binder opening credits sequence, Never Say Never Again immediately lacks that special something that sets official Bond films apart from any other espionage action movie; with John Barry's unmistakable theme music also notably absent, and a completely new cast playing the series' recurring characters, the return of Sean Connery as 007 after an absence of twelve years was always going to be a tough sell.Connery works hard to make it all work, roguish charm set to maximum, all the while ignoring the fact that he might suffer a hernia or his hairpiece could slide off at any moment, but despite his best efforts, the ageing star no longer convinces as Bond (his attempts at crude innuendo make him sound like Sid James in a Carry On film rather than the world's greatest spy). His supporting cast fare little better: Bond babes Barbara Carrera and Kim Basinger look great, but are terrible actresses; Max von Sydow and Klaus Maria Brandauer make for unmemorable baddies; and Rowan Atkinson's embarrassingly laugh-free turn as Nigel Small-Fawcett is completely pointless.Director Irvin Kirshner may have scored a hit with The Empire Strikes Back three years earlier, but on the whole he is a frustratingly mediocre film-maker, and here he is at his most uninspired, delivering an unnecessarily long movie in which the action set-pieces—a Bond movie's key selling point—are akin to an episode of Knight Rider (just how awful is that rocket powered bike?). On the plus side, Kim Basinger's flexibility is impressive, there's a fun scene in which Bond plays a daft video game against his adversary Largo (Brandauer), and the film boasts a particularly good ruined temple set towards the end, but to be honest there really is very little here worth Connery donning toupee and girdle for (apart from a whopping big pay packet, of course!).",Never Say Never Again

15,BandSAboutMovies,A great comeback,7,26 April 2020,"Over this month, we've talked about the controversy over Thunderball, with Ian Fleming not crediting Kevin McClory, which led to a copyright case and Ron Productions settling on a deal to use the novel as well as the Blofeld and SPECTRE intellectual property.By the mid 1970's, McClory wanted to remake the movie as Warhead and had Connery interested in coming back as Bond. This led to another lawsuit, as Eon thought that the results of the lawsuit allowed for the usage of elements of the story, but not Bond himself.Another version of the movie was in development as James Bond of the Secret Service, with Jack Schwartzman coming on board as a producer and adding writer Lorenzo Semple, Jr. Connery asked Diamonds Are Forever writer Tom Mankiewicz to join the project, but he felt that wouldn't be right due to his respect for Albert R. Broccoli.After Connery had finished Diamonds Are Forever, he pledged that he would ""never"" play Bond again. His wife Micheline suggested the title and by the end of another lawsuit in 1983, this movie was finally about to get made.Many of the Eon-produced Bond trademarks couldn't be in this movie, such as the gun barrel sequence, the theme and even a pre-credit sequence.In the post-Star Wars world that Moonraker attempted to navigate for Bond, this film embraces the Lucas team, with director Irvin Kershner (The Empire Strikes Back) and much of the Raiders of the Lost Ark crew, including first assistant director David Tomblin, director of photography Douglas Slocombe, second unit director Mickey Moore and production designers Philip Harrison and Stephen Grimes, coming on board.Bond fails a routine training mission and is sent by M to get in better shape. While at a health spa, he watches as Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera, Condorman) beats a patient into oblivion and battles an assassin.That beaten man - Bond is dealing with BDSM here - is Captain Jack Petachi, an Air Force pilot whose eye has been altered so that it is the same as the President of the United States. He's played by Gavan O'Herlihy of Death Wish 3. He and Fatima are working for SPECTRE and its main boss, Blofeld, played here by Max Von Sydow.Soon, he's battling SPECTRE agent Maximillian Largo, seducing his mistress Domino (Kim Basinger) and, as always, saving the world all over again.Former pro wrestlr Pat Roach is in this as a henchman. Most people will recognize him from his roles as the giant bald Nazi mechanic Indiana Jones battles outside a Flying Wing in Raiders of the Lost Ark, as well as the Man-Ape in Conan the Destroyer and General Kael in Willow.Bernie Casey is a welcome sight as Felix Leiter and Rowan Atkinson makes his screen debut as one of Bond's assistants. Plus, a pre-fame Steven Seagal was the movie's martial arts instructor. He broke Sean Connery's wrist during training, a fact that the actor didn't learn until nearly a decade later.The end, where Bond winks at the camera, is fun. However, Connery and Roger Moore had an idea for an ending where they would bump into one another in the street and Moore would say, ""Never say never again!""Years after this, McClory announced plans to make another remake starring Timothy Dalton called Warhead 2000 AD, but it never was made. Sony acquired his rights and announced that since they held the rights to his material and Casino Royale that they would make their own Bond movies. As you can imagine, this led to another lawsuit.After McClory's death, MGM acquired the rights to his intellectual property, as well as both this movie and Casino Royale, meaning that finally Blodfeld could come back to the Bond storyline, as he did in Spectre.",Never Say Never Again
16,Coventry,Bond  Contraband Bond!,6,7 January 2017,"Whilst the good old producer Albert R. Broccoli was carelessly finalizing the thirteenth official Bond movie ""Octopussy"", together with regular director John Glen and star Roger Moore, the frustrated writer/producer Kevin McClory thought it would be a funny joke to release an unofficial Bond flick with the original hero Sean Connery and – God forbid – an American (!) director by the name of Irvin Kershner. A lot of people openly wonder why ""Never Say Never Again"" ever got made. Well, I think this movie has three main reasons for existing. Number one: to sooth McClory's ego (something with a lingering lawsuit). Number two: to boost Sean Connery's popularity and bank account during a dip in his career. And number three: to mess with the heads of die-hard 007 fans, since this episode is never included in fancy collector box-set editions and has to be purchased separately! Is this one of the most redundant movies in cinematic history? Yes, most definitely! Is it worth tracking down in case you're a fan of the series or action/adventurous movies in general? Yes, it certainly is! ""Never Say Never Again"" is a reshape of the fourth official Bond movie ""Thunderball"", which also starred Connery. ""Thunderball"" coincidentally also just happens to be Bond movie I watched most recently, so it was very easy to compare them. Both films are really quite identical and the only significant difference is that 007 is twenty years older and about to enjoy his retirement. The rest is pure repeat. The multi-millionaire SPECTRE agent Largo developed a very ingenious plan to steal two nuclear warheads and holds the world at ransom by threatening to detonate them. James Bond discovers the scheme by chance, when he's in a fancy health spa and follows Largo to the Bahama's. By seducing Largo's girlfriend Domino Petachi, who still doesn't know that Largo abused and killed her brother, 007 hopes to discover where the warheads are located. The return of Sean Connery as the heroic special agent is undoubtedly the biggest trump of the film, but I usually always classify my Bond favorites based on the entertainment value of the villains. Max von Sydow makes a very promising Ernst Stavro Blofeld, but unfortunately his role is little more than a cameo. Klaus Maria Brandauer is decent but can't hold a candle to Adolfo Celi who played the role in ""Thunderball"". Most entertaining is Barbara Carrera as Bond's iron female opponent Fatima, who's as sexy and deadly as Luciana Paluzzi was in the original. I think ""Never Say Never Again"" is best enjoyed as a parody, since many aspects of the film are clearly intended to be ambiguous and humorous, like the meaning of the title itself (referring to the fact that Connery himself said that he would never play James Bond again after ""Diamond are Forever"") and the presence of Rowan Atkinson as a clumsy British ambassador.",Never Say Never Again

Max von Sydow plays archenemy Blofeld pulling strings for SPECTRE. Barbara Carrera is the lovely but evil Fatima, more than enough to turn any mans head.

19,Theo Robertson,Disappointing Bond Return,5,17 December 2002,"For me James Bond is Sean Connery . This doesn`t mean of course that a Bond film with Connery is a ready made classic , DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER is very poor for instance . But if NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN was part of the official series it`d be remembered for being average at best .The problem with NSNA is that it has all the same problems of most Bond films from the 80s : The script rambles on in a plotless manner with a computer game duel between Bond and Largo followed by Bond and Dominoe doing the tango . Needless to say these two scenes add nothing to an already loose script . And on top of this there`s too much jokiness which isn`t helped by a very self conscious feel to the film . Connery looks too old for the part by now and there`s no hard edged sadism to his performance as seen in DR NO. Best performance is by Klaus Maria Brandauer as you`d expect seeing as he was Europe`s most acclaimed actor at the time , though he doesn`t register as a classic Bond villain down to the fact he doesn`t do anything really evil .So at the end of the day NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is an anti climax due to Connery being wasted in the role of the legendary super-agent . But it`s probably no worse than most of the other Bond films of the decade",Never Say Never Again
20,Bunuel1976,"NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN (Irvin Kershner, 1983) **1/2",6,24 November 2008,"Much-inferior remake of THUNDERBALL (1965), which was possible due to Kevin McClory’s co-authorship/ownership of the original story. It also spelled Sean Connery’s lackadaisical return to the role he had made his own – while the film-makers here intended to offer competition to the official Bond saga, which had lost its original luster by this time, the result is just as uninspired (indeed, it’s basically indistinguishable from them!).For one thing, the plot is barely there this time around; Klaus Maria Braundauer is a smooth enough villain, but Max von Sydow in a very brief turn as Blofeld is surprisingly ineffectual. Barbara Carrera looks good to begin with, but her eventual over-the-top antics bring to mind Madeline Kahn from the Mel Brooks parodies more than anything else (she still managed to earn a Golden Globe nod for Best Supporting Actress)! Kim Basinger, however, is no match for Claudine Auger from the original. Interestingly, the race change undergone by the Felix Leiter character (seen in CASINO ROYALE [2006] and, most recently, QUANTUM OF SOLACE [2008]) began here. Edward Fox makes for a rather annoyingly hysterical M, while the lady playing Miss Moneypenny proves hopelessly inadequate – but Alec McCowen is fun as Q. By the way, there’s even the comic interjection of Rowan (Mr. Bean) Atkinson as an incompetent embassy official! Action sequences are reasonably well handled – the shark scenes, in fact, improve on those in THUNDERBALL itself; exchanging the underwater footage for a North African desert, the climax actually recalls that of YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE (1967), which followed in quick succession! While the prologue here is quite lame, an interesting variation on the original’s famous jet kit is seen as Bond and Leiter are fired from a submarine in missile-like shells which then tear open to reveal the flying contraption! Surprisingly, given Michel Legrand’s reputation, the soundtrack is pretty bland – though the title song (obviously a joke directed towards its reluctant star) in itself isn’t too bad. Incidentally, the credits are all quite impressive albeit working below-par: scriptwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr. (equally adept at serious espionage – THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR [1975] – as campy comic-strip fare – the 1960s “Batman” series), production designer Stephen Grimes (collaborator of both John Huston and David Lean), editor Robert Lawrence (SPARTACUS [1960]), Douglas Slocombe (who had recently done RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK [1981], the first “Indiana Jones” adventure) and, of course, director Kershner (ditto the second installment in the “Star Wars” saga, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK [1980]). There are, however, some undeniably cringe-inducing moments: Bond immobilizing a hulking villain by throwing his own urine sample into his face, wearing britches as if he were a hillbilly, riding a bicycle in his underwear, dancing a tango with Basinger and, worst of all, engaging in a silly and interminable computer game with Brandauer!",Never Say Never Again
21,zardoz-13,"""Never Say Never Again"" Is A Good Bond Escapade",8,19 April 2009,"""Empire Strikes Back"" director Irvin Kershner's ""Never Say Never Again,"" a remake of the 1965 James Bond movie ""Thunderball,"" doesn't surpasses the Terence Young original, but this non-Harry Saltzman & Albert R. Broccoli film is well worth watching if you call yourself a 007 aficionado. Nevertheless, despite its shortage of clever gadgets and the lack of a vibrant musical score, ""Never Say Never Again"" rates as an above-average, suspenseful doomsday thriller with top-flight performances by a seasoned cast including Sean Connery, Kim Basinger, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max Von Sydow, Barbara Carrera, Edward Fox, Bernie Casey, Alec McCowen, and Rowan Atkinson. The film bristles with surprises galore from the invigorating title credits sequence throughout its generally exciting but lengthy 134 minutes. Unlike the franchise James Bond sagas with their breath-taking moments of spectacle, ""Never Say Never Again"" provides few of these scenes because of its prohibitive budget. Indeed, the film features only three gadgets: an explosive ball-point pen, a wristwatch with a laser, and a souped-up motorcycle. Aside from the flavorful Lani Hall opening theme song, ""Ice Station Zebra"" composer Michel Legrand's orchestral music score leaves much to be desired. Legrand replicates none of those snappy, jazz cues that made John Barry's music for the regular Bond franchise so memorable. All in all, ""Never Say Never Again"" seems to fit more into the first two Bond movies—""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia With Love""—and ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" in terms of its more down to earth approach to the subject matter.""Never Say Never Again"" presents Sean Connery's James Bond as an older 007 who has seen his day and has been taken off active service to teach. Ironically, Roger Moore was a year older than Connery and Moore's Bond movies treated 007 as an active, young guy. Sean Connery seems to be responsible for making 007 a more mature secret agent and a number of changes take place in the Lorenzo Semple screenplay that emphasize Bond's age. Initially, Connery had lobbied to play Bond without a hairpiece, but mercifully wiser minds prevailed and Connery sports a hairpiece. He looks tanned and fit and appears in better condition than he did twelve years earlier when he was rushed into ""Diamonds Are Forever"" at the last moment to replace John Gavin. Connery had been working on another movie and had gained weight for the role that he was unable to remove in time for ""Diamonds Are Forever."" At 52, Connery still has a youthful vigor here despite the contrived demands of the script.The action unfolds with 007 single-handedly trying to rescue a kidnapped woman on a remote desert island. He dispatches several guards armed with machine guns and frees the woman, only to have her stab him with a knife in the side when he isn't looking. It seems that this entire sequence was an exercise designed by M (Edward Fox of ""Day of the Jackal"") to test Bond's ability. The new M doesn't share his predecessor's use of field agents. M decides that Bond needs to clean out his system of all 'free radicals' and has 007 packed off to Shrublands. While at the country clinic, Bond notices suspicious activity between a nurse and a patient and gets noticed watching them. The nurse is none other than SPECTRE assassin Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera of ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"") and she is in charge of making sure that nobody sees USAF officer Jack Petachi (Gavan O'Herlihy of ""Superman 3""). Petachi is part of a SPECTRE plan by millionaire businessman Maximilian Largo (Klaus Maria Brandauer of ""Out of Africa"") to black the world powers by stealing two nuclear warheads. The villains implant a duplicate eyeball into Captain Petachi who has access to the highly sophisticated computers and can order the arming of weapons. After he steals the weapons for SPECTRE, Fatima Blush runs him off the road by tossing her pet snake in his lap and then attaches an explosive to his wrecked car and blows him up. Indeed, the first part of ""Never Say Never Again,"" apart from the SPECTRE planning conference, belong to Fatima as she supervises Petachi's stay at the clinic and then repeatedly tries to kill Bond, one at sea with sharks and later in a motel suite with an explosives device.Eventually, Bond meets the beautiful blond Domino (Kim Basinger of ""Mother Lode"") and sneaks into Largo's charity banquet at a Monte Carlo casino where the two face off in an elaborate video game called 'Domination' to see who will rule the world. Bond bests him and Largo hates him doubly now because 007 is his only rival to Domino and a thorn in his side that not even Fatima seems to be able to remove. Bond and Fatima have it out after a motorcycle chase when he returns the favor and blows her up. Their earlier encounter in the Bahamas when she attached a device to lure a shark after him is pretty lame. Like in the original ""Thunderball,"" the villains recover the hijacked nuclear warheads at sea, but just the warheads themselves.Bond flies to the Bahamas where he meets his diplomatic liaison, Nigel Small-Fawcett (no lesser than Rowan Atkinson of ""Mr. Bean"" fame, who is worried that Bond may kill somebody and ruin the island paradise. Of course, Nigel Small-Fawcett serves as the film's source of comic relief. The C.I.A. sends Felix Leiter (Bernie Casey of ""Guns of the Magnificent Seven"") to back up Bond. This is the first time that an African-American portrayed Leiter. Bond encounters his share of problems, involving saving Domino from Arab slavers, while Leiter and he save the world. ""Never Say Never Again"" is a richly respectable James Bond thriller with many neat touches, but it never generates the air of danger that the franchise Bond films have. Indeed, ""Never Say Never Again"" looks like a dignified Masterpiece Theatre take on 007.",Never Say Never Again
22,neil-476,"An oddity, enjoyable but feels weird",7,25 June 2011,"Given the extent to which the James Bond franchise is a cast-iron element of the world of blockbuster movies, it is profoundly weird to remake one of them outside that series, and even more profoundly weird for that remake to star Sean Connery, the first (and arguably best) of the Bonds.All the elements of the movie series (and books) are present - M, Q, Miss Moneypenny, Felix Leiter, even though in unfamiliar form (apart from Bond himself). This unfamiliarity, even though all these elements have varied in other films in the series, makes this movie feel downright peculiar.The story - only minimal variations from the original Thunderball - works as well as it did then (no better, no worse). Klaus Maria Brandauer isn't as broad as villain Largo as Adolfo Celi was, and the climactic underwater action sequence is less spectacular.For all that, it's worth a look.

On the other hand, Connery has a lot of fun, Brandauer is a mischievous villain, Von Sydow is the most authoritative Blofeld ever (though he is underused, despite being third-billed), and Carrera is probably the best Bond villainess since....Luciana Paluzzi of the original ""Thunderball""?

With only a small time to meet the blackmail demands the British send James Bond (Sean Connery) to the Bahamas to try to find the warheads and the people responsible. Now if any of this sounds remotely familiar it's because this is the same general plot used in a previous James Bond movie, ""Thunderball"" released 18 years earlier in 1965. Of course, since the cruise missile hadn't been invented yet the story focused solely on two nuclear bombs being stolen instead. But other than that the story is basically the same. Fortunately, even though all of the actors (except Sean Connery) were different the movie still managed to be just as entertaining. Of course, having two beautiful women like Barbara Carrera (as ""Fatima Blush"") and Kim Basinger (""Domino"") certainly helped in that regard. Likewise, Klaus Maria Brandauer (""Maximilian Largo"") made an excellent villain as well.

Kim Basinger plays Largo's girlfriend while Bernie Casey is a highlight as Agent Leiter.Despite the return of Connery, ""Never Say Never Again"" (1983) is an 'unofficial' James Bond film in that it wasn't produced by Eon. As such, the recognizable Bond theme is missing, as is the opening gun barrel sequence and the familiar MI6 office cast. Other than these factors, it's a 007 film through and through. While it made a respectable profit at the box office, it didn't do as well as ""Octopussy"" with Roger Moore, released four months earlier.It's a competent enough James Bond film it just pales in comparison to the dynamic ""Octopussy,"" which is arguably the most adventuresome, action-packed 007 flick. While Connery was three years younger than Moore, he looked older. It's also not as good as the movie it remakes, ""Thunderball"" (1965). Speaking of which, why try to remake such a great Bond flick anyway? Connery already did this story 18 years earlier and very effectively; producers should've given him an entirely new tale for his final stab at 007.Some of the highlights include a knock-down-drag-out scrap between Bond and a big lug at the clinic; a clash with a couple of sharks in the waters of the Bahamas; a wild motorcycle/car chase in Nice, France; an escape from an old fortress in North Africa; and an exciting shootout at an archeological site.Super-sharp Barbara Carrera stands out on the feminine front while Basinger is winsome enough, but she never interested me. Prunella Gee is striking as Patricia, a professional at the English clinic. Saskia Cohen Tanugi plays an MI6 agent, Nicole, while Lucy Hornak has a small role as a cute nurse.The film runs 2 hours, 14 minutes, and was shot in England; Nassau, Bahamas; the French Riviera; Almería, Andalucía, Spain; Malta; and Silver Springs, Florida.GRADE: B-",Never Say Never Again

30,ShadeGrenade,Move over Roger! The 'other feller' is back!,8,4 July 2006,"As the '70's drew to a close, rumours began to fly in the entertainment industry about the possible return of Sean Connery to the role he had made famous back in 1962 - James Bond. Cubby Broccoli was asked on location in Brazil during the making of 'Moonraker' by the B.B.C.'s Barry Norman how he viewed the prospect. Understandably, the producer was reluctant to voice an opinion. 'Moonraker' outraged fans with what they perceived to be a cheapening of the character, and the jumping onto the 'Star Wars' bandwagon much as 'Live & Let Die' had done with the blaxploitation craze a few years earlier. Many publicly hoped Connery would return, if only to show Eon how a real Bond movie should look. Years of legal battles followed. The original script, entitled 'James Bond Of The Secret Service' ( later changed to 'Warhead' ) by Kevin McClory, Len Deighton, and Connery, involved the infamous Bermuda Triangle and a climactic battle in the Statue of Liberty, but was never filmed. A new script, closer to the 'Thunderball' storyline, came from Lorenzo Semple Junior, responsible for Adam West's 'Batman' and co-author of 'The Parallax View', one of the decade's finest conspiracy thrillers. Feeling it needed a British touch, Connery brought in Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, writers of hit British sitcoms 'The Likely Lads' and 'Porridge'. The witty title was suggested by Connery's wife Micheline. 'Never Say Never Again' features Connery as an older, wearier Bond, reduced to a teaching post in Her Majesty's Secret Service. When he fumbles a training exercise in South America, M ( Edward Fox ) sends him to Shrublands to get back into shape. But SPECTRE agents Fatima Blush ( Barbara Carrera ) and Lippe ( Pat Roach ) are there too. U.S. Captain Jack Pettachi ( Gavan O'Herlihy ) is recovering from surgery that has turned his retina into a copy of the American President's. The reason? To enable SPECTRE to steal two nuclear warheads and hold the entire world to ransom...The film opened before Christmas 1983 to unanimous critical praise; some used it to viciously attack the Roger Moore series, particularly that year's 'Octopussy'. Directed by Irwin Kershner, 'Never' lacks the excitement and spectacle one associates with Bond, at times it looks and feels like a T.V. movie. 'Thunderball' ( 1965 ) is superior in every respect. 'Never' was also hampered by the lack of Monty Norman's 'James Bond Theme' and Maurice Binder's gun-barrel logo. Connery though is magnificent, effortlessly stepping back into his most famous role. Hearing him deliver the one-liners is a joy. Barbara Carrera is terrific as 'Fatima', a snake-loving lady whose love for murder is such she dances after ( so she thinks ) killing Bond. Kim Basinger smolders as 'Domino'. As 'Maximillian Largo', Klaus Maria Brandauer gives a chilling, believable performance. Alec McCowen manages to create a 'Q' every bit as likable as Desmond Llewelyn's better-known version. Pamela Salem looks good as 'Moneypenny', but is underused. A major disappointment though is Max Von Sydow as 'Blofeld'. The posters gave the impression he would be a major character, but in fact he appears only in a few scenes. With a stronger script, he could have been one of the all-time great Bond villains. 'Never' promised to revert to the crunchy style of the early Eon Bonds, but did not deliver. The gadgets were there, but used almost apologetically, such as Bond's rocket-firing motorcycle. The traditional baccarat duel is replaced by a very '80's computer game called 'Domination'. There was also an unwise attempt to compete with Eon's Bonds in terms of juvenile humour ie. Bond saving himself by throwing his own urine sample into an assassin's face. But the nadir comes with Rowan Atkinson's bumbling Foreign Office official 'Nigel Small-Fawcett'. He is so awful you wonder if he thought he was in a Footlights revue. Another flaw is the lack of a decent score. Instead of John Barry, we have to make do with Michel Legrand, whose score is absolutely hopeless. He seems to never to have seen a Bond film in his life. Though the film was a financial success, Connery himself was disappointed, and not did act again for some years. 1983 was a good year for 007 maniacs - in addition to the Connery and Moore movies, George Lazenby did a delightful cameo in the made-for-T.V. 'Return Of The Man From U.N.C.L.E.: The Fifteen Years Later Affair'.",Never Say Never Again
31,JamesHitchcock,Ringing the Changes on a Familiar Theme,7,26 April 2005,"The year 1983 saw a strange phenomenon; two rival Bond films. ""Octopussy"", starring Roger Moore, was part of the official Cubby Broccoli Bond franchise. ""Never Say Never Again"", made by a rival producer, is, apart from the awful ""Casino Royale"", the only Bond movie which does not form part of that franchise. Its big attraction was that it brought back the original Bond, Sean Connery; its title reputedly derived from Connery's remark after ""Diamonds Are Forever"" that he would never again play the role. Some have complained that Connery was, at 53, too old for the role, but he was in fact three years younger than his successor Moore, who not only made ""Octopussy"" in the same year but went on to make one further Bond film, ""A View to a Kill"", two years later.The film owes its existence to the settlement of a lawsuit about the film rights to Ian Fleming's work. It is perhaps unfortunate that the terms of the settlement included a clause that the new film had to be a remake of ""Thunderball"", as that was perhaps not the greatest of the Connery Bonds. (A remake of ""Dr No"" or ""Goldfinger"" might have worked better). The plot is much the same as that of the earlier film; the terrorist organisation SPECTRE, acting together with a megalomaniac tycoon named Largo, have stolen two American nuclear warheads and are attempting to hold the world's governments to ransom by threatening to detonate them unless they receive a vast sum of money. It falls to Bond, of course, to save the world by tracking down the missing missiles.The film is fortunate in that it has not just one but two of the most beautiful Bond girls of all, Barbara Carrera as the seductive but lethal Fatima Blush and Kim Basinger as Largo's girlfriend Domino who defects to Bond's side after learning of her lover's evil plans. A number of the Bond films have a plot that hangs upon the hero's ability to win over the villain's mistress or female accomplice- there are similar developments, for example, in ""Goldfinger"", ""Live and Let Die"" and ""The Living Daylights"". In the official series, Bond's ally is normally regarded as the female lead, but here Carrera, playing the villainess, is billed above Basinger, who was a relatively unknown actress at the time. Basinger, of course, has gone on to become one of Hollywood's biggest stars, whereas Carrera is one of a number of Bond girls who have somewhat faded from view.Of the villains, Max von Sydow makes an effective Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE, but Klaus Maria Brandauer seemed too bland and nonthreatening as Largo, except perhaps during the ""Domination"" game, a more sophisticated variant on those violent computer games such as ""Space Invaders"" that were so popular in the early eighties. Brandauer can be an excellent actor in his native German, in films such as ""Mephisto"" and ""Oberst Redl"", but he does not comes across so expressively in English.One of the film's features is that it both follows the normal Bond formula and, at times, departs from it. There is the standard world-in-peril plot, chase sequences, a series of exotic locations, glamorous women, sinister villains and a specially written theme song based on the film's title. There is, however, no extended pre-credits sequence, and we see some familiar characters in a new light. For example, Bond's boss M becomes a languid, supercilious aristocrat, his American colleague Felix Leiter is shown as black for the only time, and the scientist Q is portrayed by Alec McCowen as a disillusioned cynic with (despite his characteristically upper-class Christian name of Algernon) a distinctly working-class accent. There is also an amusing cameo from Rowan Atkinson as a bumbling British diplomat. Although Connery was perhaps not quite a good here as he was in some of his earlier films in the role, this ringing the changes on the familiar theme makes this one of the more memorable Bonds. 7/10 A goof. Rowan Atkinson's character states that he is from the British Embassy in Nassau. As, however, the Bahamas is a Commonwealth country, Britain would have a High Commission in its capital, not an Embassy.",Never Say Never Again
32,DKosty123,Connery Revisits Bond,6,14 October 2007,"It took Sean Connery coming out of retirement to make this film outside of the usual Bond production company. It is a very thinly disguised remake of Thunderball. The main plot is exactly the same as the 1960's film.The differences- are the opening sequence which is really quite strong. It ties in with the rest of the film as it is used as an excuse to send Bond to a health farm. That part is unlike the 1960's film whose opening had little to do with the film but did present the first jet pack sequence on film.A big difference is the look & feel of this film. As it is not the usual production company, none of the regulars from the series are in it. Connery is much older & it shows. The most ridiculous part is the electronic game sequence of world domination between Bond & the bad guy. If this sequence we dropped from the movie, it would be no great loss to me.If your a real Connery fan, or want to waste a little time on a rainy day, this film will do that for you. This will never be a classic film that would challenge Goldfinger, but is an interesting diversion.",Never Say Never Again
33,KineticSeoul,Battle of the Bonds,7,6 February 2016,"Although this is not a official James Bond canon film that is part of the franchise since it is not produced by Eon Production company. It's a alright rehash of the 007 movie ""Thunderball"" which also starred Sean Connery as James Bond. So the story behind the making of this film is that Kevin McClory was one of the guys that collaborated together to make ""Thunderball"". Kevin McClory was obsessed with one of his works which is ""Thunderball"". So he fought tooth and nails to get the rights for the Bond franchise when the courts ruled him out. There was a long legal case and it was ruled that after 10 years ""Thunderball"" would revert back to him. Kevin McClory really wanted ""Thunderball"" to be his own, so he even hired Sean Connery from the first Bond movies to reprise his role as 007. Thinking that having Connery would be the trump card to winning the battle against McClory's opposing side. At the same year the movie ""Octopussy"" distributed by United Artists/Eon Productions came out. And when it came to the box office, ""Octopussy"" won by a small margin. So it was Bond basically trying to kill off Bond at that time. Anyways this one portrays Bond as a aging agent working for MI6 and losing his edge, thus he goes back to training. I agree that Sean was a bit old to play Bond, but it wasn't all that distracting and he still had the iconic essence of James Bond going. The villain this time is a rich ego maniac named Largo, who through his wealth steals 2 warheads and tries to commit extortion around the world. And it's up to James Bond to stop him with the help of the Bond girls of course. Kim Basinger is one of the Bond girls that will stay relevant in the acting game in Hollywood for quite some time. This really is a understated Bond film that just didn't get the recognition it deserved despite having one of the best Bond's in it...Sean Connery. This is a down to earth Bond film, well down to earth when it comes to a Bond film with Sean Connery in it. That has it's moments from time to time, one being where one of the villains blowing up the hotel room that Bond was staying at. However Bond was in another room shagging a woman and say ""it's good that I made the right decision"" the girl he is shagging asks ""about what?"" where Bond responds by saying ""your place or mine"". The car chase sequence in this or the motorcycle chase scene in this was executed very well and was actually entertaining to watch. Which ends with a amusing scene with James Bond and a sadistic female villain. Again this is a understated Bond film that didn't get the right treatment because it isn't part of the original 007 franchise. I don't know if it's because of the updates or because of Sean Connery, but I was personally entertained from start to finish with this installment.7.2/10",Never Say Never Again
34,OllieSuave-007,It's more like a stand-alone action flick.,6,8 June 2017,"Sean Connery returns as James Bond, in a movie remake of Thunderball. Here, mad man Maximilian Largo steals two American nuclear warheads and demands millions of dollars in ransom from the world leaders. As a result, MI6 reactivates their ""00"" agents and James Bond comes out of retirement to carry on the mission.Armed with secret weapons and an armor of one-liners, Connery still shines once again as the suave 007, though, he does look rather emotionless and mellow portraying his character at times. There is lesser action in this movie than in previous Bond films, but some of the the thrills are still a little entertaining, especially the part where Bond attempts to dispatch the femme fatale Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera).Sorely missing is John Berry's iconic James Bond theme and score, and what we have instead is a very 80s-sounding soundtrack from Michel Legrand. The acting was just OK for the most part - Connery had some good chemistry with the Bond Girls, but much of the other cast members were forgettable. Max von Sydow gave a mediocre performance as Blofeld, Edward Fox gave a very overzealous and pompous portrayal of M and Rowan Atkinson gave a rather unfunny role as Small-Fawcett. Klaus Maria Brandauer gave a convincing villain in Maximilian Largo - slimy and sly, making you want to punch him in the face.The film its adventurous moments, but, it's not one of the best Bond movies out there - it's more like a stand alone action flick.Grade C+",Never Say Never Again
35,gridoon,Insufferably boring.,6,10 September 1999,"Although it's not quite the worst Bond movie ever made (""A View To A Kill"" and ""Dr. No"" are worse, for example""), this is still an insufferably boring, visually unimpressive film. It lacks many of the series' trademarks (where is the genuine ""Q""??) and feels awkward and out-of-place. The direction has no sense of rhythm whatsoever and the film creates no tension whatsoever. What partially saves this entry is Connery's highly enjoyable performance: he shows a gift for self-parody that almost equals Moore's similar gift. His performance in ""Thunderball"" has always been his zestiest one, and he brings some of that zest here, too. But, as a whole, the film is inferior to ""Thunderball"" and VASTLY inferior to Moore's generally entertaining ""Octopussy"".",Never Say Never Again
36,Lejink,From Forever To Never,7,8 November 2020,"Released in competition with the official franchise's ""Octopussy"", with Sean Connery picking up where he left off 13 years earlier from ""Diamonds Are Forever"", ""Never Say Never Again"" is far better than one of Moore's weaker outings but falls short when you dive down into the detail. And dive down is the operative phrase, the film being a strongly recognisable rewrite of ""Thunderball"" from the opening where Bond is attacked in a gym to the later underwater focus for much of the action.While it has Connery back on board, for contractual reasons we get offputting new versions of M, Q, Moneypenny and Felix Leiter. These parts are all competently played, especially Edward Fox's hoity-toity M, but you also miss that Bond theme, John Barry's incidental music, an exciting pre-opening titles prelude and even a decent title song.Otherwise, it's slickly directed, with exotic location shooting and some excellently dressed sets, while the choice of the supporting talent in Connery's wake is pleasingly strong, from Klaus Maria Brandauer's relatively youthful malevolent Largo, Barbara Carrera as his cold-blooded hit-woman and Kim Basinger as the damsel in distress. An almost unrecognisable Max Von Sydow is rather wasted as Blofeld, while Rowan Atkinson tries out his own later Johnny English character as a bumbling ""intelligence"" man who acts as a gopher.Connery of course can't hide his age, especially in some of the fight scenes, but still gets to flaunt his torso and generally looks almost as fit and handsome as ever, indeed, clean-shaven and wearing the same wig as in ""Diamonds..."", he just about carries off the movie. There's a little less reliance on gadgetry although the producers can't resist getting Bond on a motor bike, in a chase scene the Tom Cruise - ""Mission Impossible"" franchise would later build on, on horseback, plunging into the sea from a great height (and I sincerely hope no animals were killed or injured during the making of this film) plus he even gets strapped back into a jet-pack for Bond's sake.The film does lack a big finish however and even fluffs its chance at providing a memorable epilogue, resorting to humour instead. Indeed, for this film, Connery himself co-opted the uncredited assistance of the top British comedy writing team (""Likely Lads"", ""Auf Wiederschen Pet"" and ""Porridge"") of Dick Clements and Ian La Fresnais to add some spiky levity (they even find a way to recycle, if that's the right word, the well-known ""urine sample"" gag from ""Porridge"".Still, I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would although there's little doubt that this iconic role definitely suits a younger man, at least in my opinion.",Never Say Never Again
37,bowmanblue,A Bond too far,6,16 June 2014,"Yes, we all love Sean Connery's Bond. However, age gets to us all and we really should know when to call it a day. Shame on you Mr Connery. Yes, you're still a cool old guy, but you should have known better. Connery hadn't been in the Bond character for some years and was lured back for this one which, due to technical and legal reasons, isn't considered part of the 'official' Bond saga.It's not even an original story, being a remake of the not-so-spectacular 'Thunderball.' But, worst of all, is that Connery is starting to show his age. He's looking less like the dashing rogue we saw in Dr No and more like your uncle at a wedding.Yes, there's some action, some fights and car chases, but it just doesn't feel like a proper Bond film. All the cast have been replaced as the producers weren't allowed to use the 'proper' M, Q and Miss Moneypenny. Plus - and unforgive able in my opinion - is the lack of the 'Bond theme' every time the action gets going.The whole thing has a 'Bond-made-for-TV' feel to it. If you're a die hard fan of Bond and are craving one last Connery outing then you'll probably get something out of it. However, if you're casual fan of the franchise then you can probably afford to give this one a miss.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Never Say Never Again

Sean Connery deserved a better fate for his Bond return",5,10 September 2013,"Ah. Yes. The Battle of The Bonds which this was heavily billed as; Sean Connery Vs Roger Moore! Roger Moore was firmly entrenched in the Bond role, whilst Connery was making his return after 12 years. Never Say Never Again did good at the box office, but Octopussy wound up grossing more than Connery's at the box office, and it was a bit of a crushing blow. I can see why Octopussy did better business. Octopussy is an entertaining Bond film, and while this movie has its moments, it's a bit of a mess as well. This is a standalone picture, and NOT part of the Bond series. Connery is great and the action scenes are way better done than Thunderball, as well as the pacing, but that doesn't change that it reeks of rewrites. Sean Connery is in fine form as Bond with that suave charm that we've all come to know. He's also in great shape and tributes his time as Bond with an Austin Martin vehicle. That was a nice touch. Kim Basinger is certainly classy and very pretty, but it's not one of her best performances. She lacks the personality to be a Bond girl. Klaus Maria Brandauer is OK as the villain, and fitfully menacing, but that's about it. I didn't think there was anything special about him. Barbara Carrera is very sexy and enigmatic. I loved her. Max Von Sydow does fine as Blofeld, but he's not the main villain here. Rowan Atkinson provides a couple of chuckles in one of his early roles. Final Thoughts: Its not bad, just rather uninspired for such a big return. It's mostly watchable, despite a few dull moments here and there, but I felt Connery deserved a lot better.

And so there isn't much to distinguish it from the others except that Connery does look a bit long in the tooth, and the film makes jokes about Bond's age. Actually, this is as good as any of Connery's original six except for ""Goldfinger."" Brandauer makes a good villain while Basinger and Carrera are capable Bond girls.

Welcome Back Mr. Bond,8,23 May 2017,"Never Say Never Again (1983)Plot In A Paragraph: A SPECTRE agent has stolen two American nuclear warheads, and A long retired James Bond (Connery) is brought back and must find their targets before they are detonated.It was The Battle Of The Bond's in 1983 a returning Connery had this movie, whilst Roger Moore starred in Octopussy. My second favourite Bond movie of the 80's (Behind Licence To Kill) I think this is better than anything Roger Moore turned out that decade, and its superior to Thunderball which it is a loose remake of.It's not without its faults, it has some ropey effects, its theme song is OK, but not up to the usual high standard of songs. And It's a bit daft how Kim Basinger's Domino trust Bond straight away, he touched her up in health club, he introduced himself and they had a chat at the bar (within a 24 hour period) and that's it. She immediately cares about him, and believes everything he tells her over her long term partner.12 years after his last outing as Bond, it's a welcome return for Connery. As much as he'd hate to admit it, he is right at home in the role. It's the the first time he had been clean shaven since 1971, and it would mark the last time he would appear on screen clean shaven too. It has a good amount of tension and the perfect amount of humour too. Most of the supporting cast nails it too Klaus Maria Brandauer makes an a compelling villain (much better than the full guy with an eye patch in Thunderball) Max Von Sydow is in full pantomime villain mode as Blofeld, Kim Basinger looks great and is OK as Domino and Barbara Carrera is a lot of fun too. Bernie Casey is fine as Felix Leiter and Roman Atkinson has a small role too. Edward Fox is awful as M though. I don't know what was going on there.In the end Never Say Never Again lost The Battle Of The Bond's (Octopussy grossed $12 million more) but It gave Connery a much needed boost at the box office. grossing $9.72 million on its first weekend, which was reported to be the best opening record of any James Bond up to that point and surpassing Roger Moore's Octopussy's $8.9 million from June that year. It ended up grossing $55 million at the domestic box office (which was a solid return on a budget of $36 million) to end the year the 14th highest grossing movie of 1983. Connery would not star in another movie for three years. When he did return, it was mostly older, wiser mentor roles from then on. So as a goodbye to the leading man, sex symbol, action man Connery (excluding The Rock) this was a good way to bow out.",Never Say Never Again

44,Rodrigo_Amaro,It was working great as a comedy but then it got lost somewhere,5,23 April 2011,"This unofficial Bond film made history in all these years watching films: it is the first time that I reevaluate a film that originally I didn't like and it didn't live up for a positive review, which means it failed twice and I don't need to see it again. I firmly believe that a film must conquer you from the first view, but after seeing some acclaimed films failing on this view I decided to watch them again, and it turned out to be better films than I thought. This is not acclaimed but it is very trashed, and now I can agree with the poor reviews it received over the years. This really blows a lot, but I must recognize that it's not that bad but it slowly dies in front of you and makes you wondering why it was made in the first place? ""Thunderball"" wasn't enough? It's not part of the official series because there was a rivalry between producers and people who had the rights for making the film, so this guy decided to tell the story the way he wanted. The initial goofy (and very interesting) comedy, that is used slightly in the official Bond films - specially in the ones with Roger Moore - is amazing, and made a whole difference in this film; and if the director Irvin Kershner and the script stay with that it would be a helluva of comedy. The best scene in the film is seeing a totally out of shape Sean Connery fighting a big guy, winning the fight by throwing a liquid on the guy's face to later realize that it was his own urine sample.Oh, the plot: Bond is out of condition to work, so M (Edward Fox) sends 007 to a spa to treat himself for the free radicals, lose some weight when he discovers a strange plot involving nuclear bombs, Blofeld (Max von Sydow) and his cute cat; a crazy villain (Klaus Maria Brandauer) and hot girls (played by Barbara Carrera and Kim Basinger). There's a huge and boring lapse between the action scenes that it is unbearable to sit through the whole film and take it seriously. This dumb indecision of being a comedy and a action film ruined the whole thing.Compared to the other Bond films this don't stand a chance at almost nothing. Action sequences aren't interesting; the humor is very pathetic but hilarious, a prophetic sight for parody films about secret agents that are also loose cannons; the dramatic moments are silly, very boring; the main song ""Never Say Never Again"" is quite funny, a little bit nice. But, Connery even in his 50's something still rocked the boat playing 007 and he's quite good in his return to the role that made him famous. The casting is cool, there are good performances, very enjoyable but that's it, nothing more.Here's a weak Bond film that shouldn't be made, shouldn't be watched by die hard fans of the British agents unless you want some fun at the first minutes, when ""Never Say Never Again"" is a high class comedy.

49,Anonymous_Maxine,"A quality re-make, but still not nearly as good as Thunderball.",8,9 August 2001,"I'm sick and tired of people complaining that Never Say Never Again is just a weak remake of Thunderball. Yes, that movie's influence is unmistakable, but the tremendous and almost universal inferiority of re-made films is reserved for such thoughtless and unintelligent films like the 1998 re-make of Psycho. While it's true that the opening theme of the twelfth (and Connery's last) Bond film is one of the worst of the entire series, the film itself still manages to stand on its own, despite many other weaknesses. Besides that, even the weak title song is made to blend pretty nicely with the closing dialogue in the film.Sure, Sean Connery was getting a little on in age when this movie was filmed (at least by James Bond standards), but there is plenty of evidence in the narrative that makes it clear that this was not exactly unknown to the filmmakers. James Bond is near retirement before he is handed his assignment, having spent most of recent time teaching, not doing, and there is even the tongue in cheek insistence from M that he pay more attention to his health, dieting and training and getting more exercise and whatnot. Besides, this is James Bond, remember? This guy is supposed to be some kind of super human, and all of his fans are getting all upset because he's got some gray hairs. When this guy retires at the end of the film, M sends poor `Small-Fawcett' (in a hilarious cameo from Rowan Atkinson) to tell Bond that without him, he worries about the safety of the free world, and all of you people can't get over the fact that he's not a sprightly young man anymore. Come on, Sean Connery could STILL play James Bond just as good as he ever could, or at least better than anyone else ever has been able to.The majority of the film deals with the elaborate plan to steal nuclear missiles and hold the world hostage (as Dr. Evil would say, `Oh hell, let's just do what we always do'), so there's clearly not much new there, but this is one of the Bond films that had the better one liners. There's the amusing scene where Bond is asked for a urine sample  `If you could just fill this beaker for me' `From here?' There are a lot of good one-liners, but the sexual innuendos aimed at Mr. Bond are especially prevalent in this installment. But then later he happens to throw that very urine sample into a villain's face, making him scream as if his face were burning off. Not a very good attempt at comic relief, especially since this guy had been kicking Bond's ass with some sort of super-spring device that could cut through pretty much anything. And of course, Kim Basinger stars in this film as one of the best Bond girls of the entire series.It's no secret that Never Say Never Again has dated badly, and one of the things that has dated the worst is the special effects  with the one exception of the flying missiles, which were obviously fake but still impressive for 1982. The colored contact lens at the beginning of the film was totally without effect, and the laser watch was one of the worst things in the entire movie, second only to those damn sharks. Evidently, Fatima Blush put some sort of device on his scuba tank that attracted sharks (granted, they did have weird guiding mechanisms of their own), in a scene that more than likely inspired the classic line, `I have one simple request. And that is to have sharks with FRICKIN' laser beams attached to their heads!' And then, of course, there is the exploding hotel room scene which was redone in an episode of The Simpsons, and which was obviously followed by another obligatory and overly casual one-liner from James.
The domination video game created by Largo, the film's villain, is an especially memorable scene, and the film also boasts what is probably the best motorcycle chase in the entire series (far to superior to the laughable one in Tomorrow Never Dies). But despite many strengths, the film's weaknesses are left clearer in the audience's mind at the end of the film due in large part to the anticlimactic underwater conclusion (one of the more obvious parts borrowed from Thunderball, and inferiorly recreated). Never mind the fact that Largo revealed some crucial information to Bond as he left him in the tower alive (Dr. Evil's brilliance, once again, `I'll just leave him there without actually witnessing his death and just assume everything went to plan. What?'), the climax of what is expected to be a fast-paced action film should never take place in a muted underwater atmosphere. All in all, Never Say Never Again ranks very highly on the James Bond scale, and Connery's wink at the end of the film (as well as the two closing lines) suggested at the time that he may still return for another turn as Bond. Clearly, this is no longer very likely, so we can only hope.",Never Say Never Again

At the time, this movie was competing with Octopussy, which if choosing between the two, I pick this one hands down. The villain is played brilliantly by Klaus Maria Brandeur who has diabolical plans to release two warheads. This great actor knows how to blend suave and bad into one, you'll almost don't want him to be a bad guy. The film even makes video games look deadly, I felt my hand burning up. Cool was that rocket that encapsuled Bond, plus the motorcycle chase. Of course the film heralded a new beauty, Basinger as the love interest, and we have a little fun with Atkinson's character. Never Say Never Again is just a super cool Bond film, and the fact it feels unBondish, when compared to the others, makes it cool itself in this fact. You never know where the film will go next.",Never Say Never Again
51,GOWBTW,"Not an original series, but at least the original Bond is back!",8,4 March 2009,"Though this version of the 007 saga isn't original, the fun faction is. In ""Never Say Never Again"", James Bond(Sean Connery) is fighting not only SPECTRE, but red tape that the organization is being held by. His skills seems flawless, but his boss is the biggest blow-hard ever seen. He helps the sister(Kim Basinger) of an Air Force soldier who's being the pawn of SPECTRE's scheme. His service of SPECTRE was short when the implanted a code in his right eye. After he's done getting the warheads, he is eliminated by Fatima Blush(Barbara Carrera). She's one mean demon! It's a crying shame that his boss is cutting out all the ""00""'s. Why was he the boss from the beginning? He's nothing but a bureaucratic jerk. When Bond and Felix Leiter(Bernie Casey) go to the Bahamas that's when all the fun begin. The only original star in the movie is Connery, and others like Max Von Sydow as Blofeld , Klaus Maria Brandauer as Largo, and even Rowan Atkinson whose character is nothing like ""Mr. Bean"". Not a bad movie, it's too bad it wasn't a true Bond film. But anything with Sean Connery is great! 3 out of 5 stars!",Never Say Never Again
52,freemantle_uk,Connery should have meant never,3,29 August 2016,"Never Say Never Again is an oddity of a film, made because of a legal dispute screenwriter Kevin McClory and MGM after McClory worked with Ian Fleming when writing for Thunderball before it was turned into a novel and subsequently turned into a film. After McClory sued he was allowed to credited as a producer, got the rights to the character of Blofeld and organisation SPECTRE and allow to make his own Bond film after enough time has elapsed. This is more interesting then the actual film.In Never Say Never Again Sean Connery plays an aging Bond working for an MI6 that has limited funding and an M (Edward Fox) who has no respect for the 00 section. After failing a training exercise Bond is sent to a health camp to get back into shape and stumbles on a plot that leads to the theft of two American nuclear warheads and leads to Bond going back into action to stop SPECTRE and their agent Maximillian Largo (Klaus Maria Brandauer).Never Say Never Again is an interesting case study of a film, made because the rights controversial, that allowed another Bond film to be made outside the main series and to see Connery return one more time as Bond because of the big paycheque and as a way to say screw you to EON. It is the most official unofficial franchise film to be made. It even lead to a media dubbing 1983 as the Battle of the Bonds, forcing Roger Moore to stay on in the official series. The official one won.Never Say Never Again is really a poor remake of Thunderball, which is a damning indictment because Thunderball is one of the weaker Connery Bond films. McClory and co could only make a film with the Thunderball plot, so the big selling point was the return of Connery. Never Say Never Again did have some interesting ideas, we see an older Bond who seems past his best, an idea that was used in Skyfall, has an M who has a dislike to Bond, like Judi Dench's M in Goldeneye and showing MI6 struggling financially and politically. But that idea seems to be an excuse to for why Never Say Never Again then be a commentary about the espionage world. Plus the official series ended up doing these ideas better then Never Say Never Again.The film does has some decent set-pieces, the opening training exercise was strong except for the god-awful theme song, the fight in health club and the motorbike chase and the scene where Bond dances with Domino (Kim Basinger) could have easily have fitted in an official Bond film. Barbara Carrera as the main henchwoman, Fatima Blush was a great addition and Alec McCowen was strong as the film's Q, Algernon, having great banter with Connery and having to work with work with limited resources. The film also the excellent casting of Max von Sydow as Blofeld, a man who would have been perfect to play an official Bond villain.Despite these positives Never Say Never Again is weaker then most entries in the Bond series and can tie with Diamonds Are Forever as the worst Connery Bond film. Like Diamonds Are Forever Never Say Never Again had an interesting set-up for a darker, more thoughtful Bond but wasted the potential. The film has also feels very dated, that it was a product of its time - the special effects look worst then what was in Thunderball and the video game sequence was just added because of the growing popularity of video games. Even the music didn't feel approach for a Bond film or even an action film in general: it sounded more like an attempt of making a jazz album. The score only has action beat during the climax. Bond was also still able to bed women 20 to 25 years his junior, which was just creepy with the film having a nonchalant attitude towards it.Fox as M was wasted. He had a great set-up as a civil servant and an outsider to the intelligence service, someone who has run down the 00 section. He was just made out to be pompous public school boy with no understanding of the world and Fox exaggerated every mannerism. He was the worst portrayal of the character, official or unofficial.Never Say Never Again is just an exercise in vanity from McClory and Connery, making it just because they could. It was made out of spite and if Connery wasn't involved no one would have been interested. It is nothing but a footnote in the Bond series.",Never Say Never Again

Fortunately no one sports a droopy moustache although Priscilla,Queen of the desert - sorry - Barbara Carrera might have found one to twirl thoughtfully if thought was required...but then again I don't suppose it was. M is shown to be a camp,petulant pouting idiot.Mr Edward Fox - surely one of the most mannered actors ever to be over - exposed on our screens - plays the Head of the Secret Service as an inbred upper class cretin,but why am I surprised?All his characters are played as inbred upper class cretins.On the other hand Q is portrayed by Mr Alec Mcowen as a sharp - witted cheery cockney.I don't have a problem with that per se,there aren't that many sharp-witted jolly cockneys in James Bond films as a rule,but Mr Mcowen's talents do not extend to ""doing cockney"",and his attempts at cheery matiness are cringe-making. Herr Brandaeur oozes sophisticated European charm but fails dismally to combine it with the required lunatic menace and Miss K.Basinger,I'm afraid,can neither dance nor act on this evidence which is rather inconvenient as she is required to do both. Mr Connery gives a very perfunctory performance,still it probably saved him from having to take out a second mortgage on his place in the Bahamas. I suppose one must mention Mr Rowan Atkinson;there,I've done it. The man with the President's eye - didn't anyone notice it was missing - is guilty of one of the worst performance I have seen in sixty years of movie-going.

NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN makes the notoriously cheap Eon Production Company (which has churned out THUNDERBALL and 22 other Bond flicks to date) look like a bunch of spendthrifts by way of comparison, with this pale imitation Bond coming off as a second-tier made-for-TV two-night mini-series. NEVER's low production values (beginning with its jarring elevator Muzak score and Junky theme song) hypothetically could have been balanced out somewhat by passable plotting and acting. Instead, we get almost as cringe-inducing of a spoof as the original 1967 CASINO ROYALE (which cast an elderly David Niven as Agent 007). At least that film made no bones about what it was trying to be, whereas an ancient-looking Connery is totally ludicrous as NEVER's lead field agent. Only the villains are more laughable here. Ignoring the fact that Q's Weaponized writing pens have been in every toy store for 19 years, SPECTRE's Agent 12--Fatima--""disarms"" Bond, and then delays his execution by ordering him to whip out his pen to write that she was the best he ever had!

55,drqshadow-reviews,"Connery's Last Hurrah is a Limp, Dated Affair",3,12 August 2019,"After a dozen years of sabbatical, Sean Connery slips into an old tuxedo, wraps his fist around a cold martini and reclaims the role of James Bond for one last lap around the racetrack. Connery looks rather gray for the part, but neither he nor the filmmakers shy away from that. Rather, he's portrayed as an old spy come out of retirement, with a renewed reliance on gadgets and sneaky tricks in lieu of dust-ups or more physical slices of action. That's admirably honest, particularly in contrast to Eon's stubborn insistence that fifty-six year old Roger Moore was not an older man at all, and it might've paid off, had the ensuing film shown any sense of style or panache.Instead, Never Say Never Again is thoroughly safe, flat and workmanlike, as though it were already looking forward to cashing checks for the sequel. There's no fire to the plot, no energy to the performances. Sir Sean seems perfectly content to let his mere presence do all the work, showing no sign of the magnetic, charismatic personality that once made him so irresistible. Much of the film's structure feels silly and out-of-date, too, perhaps reaching for familiar material to put the aging superstar at ease. Even the big set pieces land with a thud. How is it possible for a jetpack chase to feel so boring?Grinding through the last hour is a terrible chore, drug out and underwhelming as it is. By that point, it's already obvious that not even James Bond can pull out of this tailspin.",Never Say Never Again

Also I have never seen such an unconvincing bond girls.Screenplay is average so as cinematography, the cinematographer was not at all successful in capturing the beautiful locations. Action scenes are good but we can clearly get a feeling of tiring Connery. Background music is impressive. Acting is decent and it seems that the female stars were more focusing of showing instead of acting which we have never seen in any of the previous bond movies.Climax of the movie is predictable still good.Overall it seems that late Connery was the sole fighter for this movie with some support from Klaus in the role of somewhat a weak villain.

It's more of a laid-back performance from him, but still an extremely effective one from my favourite Bond lead actor.Klaus Maria Brandauer is very good as Largo, marginally better than Adolfo Celi's showing. Barbara Carrera and Kim Basinger are likeable in their roles, especially Basinger. 'Never Say Never Again's' counterpart also has a solid cast, in fairness.I thoroughly enjoyed this for the majority, despite the ending falling a bit short overall. In fact, the main plot does feel secondary for a lot of the time.

59,slokes,Connery's 007 Bow Offers Moore Fun,7,30 November 2009,"Yes, it's Sean Connery playing Bond again, looking more alive and into his part than any time since the first time they made this film, in 1965 when it was called ""Thunderball"". But the tongue is so firmly in cheek one wonders if Connery isn't employing a few observed tricks from his friend and more humorous successor, Roger Moore.Moore is my favorite Bond, but Connery makes a strong case for himself in this unusual outing. The only serious Bond film not made under the aegis of the classic Eon Bond series, ""Never Say Never Again"" is an irreverent return to the well. Soft on action, it's nevertheless strong on character and clever dialogue.Bond, it's made clear right away, is a man in disfavor. No matter how many times he has saved the world, his new boss thinks little of his fat lifestyle. ""Too many free radicals, that's your problem...Caused by eating too much red meat, white bread, too many martinis."" ""Then I shall cut out the white bread, sir,"" Bond smartly replies.An early fight sequence in a spa represents the movie's high point action-wise, with Bond and an attacker fighting their way through a kitchen, a bedroom, and a laboratory before Bond finally douses his opponent, ironically with no small help from those free radicals. Humor is liberally applied in the film, rather more cleverly than most of Moore's outings, though Connery seems to be having more fun sending himself up as a result of Moore's less egotistic example.Was it because he was making a good chunk of the gross? Or was it working for less stingy producers? Whatever it is, the screenplay serves his laid-back style well, and the result is richer and more entertaining than Connery's prior two Eon Bond outings, ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""Diamonds Are Forever"".The 1980s were not a good decade for Bond, whether it was Connery, Moore, or Timothy Dalton. Leg warmers, video games, and ugly sports cars are all in evidence, and the Bianca Jagger sunglasses Klaus Maria Brandauer is seen wearing in his first scene do him no favors. Forget first impressions. Brandauer's role as the chief villain, Maximilian Largo, is one of the best in any Bond film, with Brandauer enjoyably playing up his character's menace and mania. At one point, he allows Bond free roam of his situation room, with a martini to boot, and his dancing eyes and mad, engaging grin make for compelling company throughout.The best thing in this film, other than Connery, are the Bond girls, shot with more attention to personality than normal in Bond films, a testament to cinematographer Douglas Slocombe and director Irvin Kirshner. Barbara Carrera was nominated for a Golden Globe for her role as the villainess Fatima Blush, every bit as crazy as Largo and even nicer to look at. She doesn't last the whole movie; you almost need her gone in order to focus on the others.Kim Basinger's breasts and buttocks should have had their own agents for the screen time they get in this film, but I'm not complaining. Basinger's a rare beauty who in this early role as Largo's mistress mixes incredible hotitude with a childlike vulnerability that brings out the Bond in me, and many others I suspect. (Her lips and cheekbones are pretty sweet, too.)It's not a well-constructed film. It's a knockoff of a better Bond movie with a sloppy storyline, a terrible score, and a flat ending. But it does have Connery, proving his was the definitive take on cinema's definitive secret agent, even if he steals a page or two from my 007, Mr. Moore. The end result is entertaining enough, so I'm not complaining.",Never Say Never Again

Producer Kevin McClory took advantage of the fact that he owned the copyright on one of Ian Fleming's novels, persuaded Connery to return for one last hurrah as the superstar spy, assembled a great crew and turned in a first rate action adventure movie. All the proper Bond elements are here - international intrigue, glamorous locales (it was shot mostly in the Bahamas and Monaco), sexy women, villainous cabals, groovy gadgets and non-stop thrills. There are at least five standout sequences - a sprawling fistfight in a health farm, an eye-popping shark attack scene (shot by Ricou Browning, the Creature From The Black Lagoon himself), a classic Bond versus Villain confrontation showdown involving an electrified video game, a terrific chase with Connery on a Yamaha 650 turbo motorbike pursuing Carrera through the backstreets of Monte Carlo, and a great final shootout in a subterranean Islamic cavern. After a twelve-year hiatus, Connery stepped back into his signature role with apparently effortless ease and knocks off both the suave action and the libidinous comedy with aplomb. The rest of the cast all get into the larger-than-life sensibility with fine performances (except for Fox, who is terrible), but extra special plaudits must go to Nicaraguan actress Carrera as the drop-dead-gorgeous, mad-as-a-march-hare, fabulously villainous assassin Fatima Blush; she kills people, she drives cars fast, she kisses snakes, she dresses up in nurses' outfits, she blows things up, she turns waterskiing into an erotic art form and she's hilarious all the while. I think she gets my vote for best Bond Girl of all time (although Caroline Munro in The Spy Who Loved Me and Famke Janssen in Goldeneye come close). Lorenzo Semple Jr's script is a tight, thrill-a-minute treat, slamming along and pushing all the right buttons, and is backed up by sensational stuntwork, great sets and a brilliant cast. Perhaps the only thing lacking is a really good score - Michel Legrand's music is fine, but lacks the epic bombastic quality of one of John Barry's finer efforts. Aside from this minor quibble though, this is slam-bang entertainment and a must-see for all James Bond addicts.",Never Say Never Again
61,adamjohns-42575,Double oh no!!,1,24 October 2020,"This film is proof that you shouldn't do something just because you can. When Sean said Never to doing another Bond, after Diamonds Are Forever, he should have stuck to his Walter PPK's!
He was far too old to play the part in this one and the story was so dull, because we've seen it all before in Thunderball and, let's face it, not much has been new about Bond since he left the franchise in the first place. I'm actually very glad to say I am a part of the Daniel Craig generation, which is far more realistic, appealing and with a much more handsome leading man.The film was dated, even for 1983. It felt like it has been filmed in the mid 60's. Max Von Sydow's part was pointless as he had such little air time and most of the other characters were made in to fools, poorly chosen comic relief.It's a shame that it wasn't done better, for the sake of Fatima Blush and Largo, who were great characters, played very well, but it all just felt a bit flat and passé.So many things are wrong with the bonds of this era -
*Why does he always manage to get in to trouble and have to have someone get him out, if he's such a good spy?
*How come every other spy on the planet can recognise him on sight, but he is completely clueless as to who they are?
*Why does M ride him so hard, when he has supposedly saved the world so many times?
*Why did they put Rowan Atkinson in this film? *How are you supposed to tell the girls apart, when they all look the same?
*Why are the CIA always letting him take the lead and only providing him with back up?
*Can Q predict the future? Or is it purely a coincidence that he always provides Bond with just the right equipment?
*And why do these women fall for, in Roger's case, an obviously gay man and in Sean's, someone who is old enough to be their father with a fake tan and make up that makes him look somewhat clown like?Maybe you had to be there from the start and to have read the books, but when I get around to those books, I will be thinking of Daniel as his more serious and sensible version.",Never Say Never Again
62,a_chinn,"Oddball, but better than most 1980s Bond films",7,9 September 2017,"Oddball James Bond film is not part of the official Eon Production cannon. Kevin McClory, a producer and writer on ""Thunderball"" won a legal battle against Ian Fleming to make his own Bond movie based upon his version of the ""Thunderball"" script. In this versions Connery plays an older Bond, but very much like in the original ""Thunderball"" finds himself going after SPECTRE agents who've stole nuclear warheads. It's the usual Bond nonsense, but it's a lot better than the Roger Moore output at this same time (though ""For Your Eyes Only"" was quite good). Still, this one did subscribe to the over-use of gadgets that the Moore films were doing, which is unfortunate. On the plus side, this film does boast an excellent cast. Max von Sydow plays Blofeld, Edward Fox plays M, Bernie Casey plays Felix Leiter, Klaus Maria Brandauer is the industrialist villain, Largo. Barbara Carrera and Kim Basinger are Bond Girls. There's even Rowan Atkinson in his film debut in a small bit of comic relief. The film also has a quaint scene that was super cool back in the day, where James Bond plays a very lame video game where you have to claim more shapes on a digital line drawn map before your opponent. Hot off of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" the film was directed by Irvin Kershner, who brings an assured hand to the action. McClory offered John Barry a chance to score the film, but he declined out of loyalty to Albert R. Broccoli, producer of the main series. Instead, Michel Legrand provides a solid score for the film, even if it's lacking the ""James Bond Theme."" Even if this is far from the best bond film (though better than most of the 80s Bond output), this film does hold a fair amount of nostalgia for me; Brandauer and Connery's intense confrontation over the very lame video game, Connery chained up in a skeleton filled cell, and Kim Basinger dancing were all moments that burned themselves into my adolescent brain. Interesting note of trivia: a young Steven Seagal was the martial arts instructor for this film and broke Sean Connery's wrist during training.",Never Say Never Again
63,eric262003,No Need For Remake Since The Original Exceeds This Remake,6,10 November 2008,"By far, ""Thunderball"" is a true classic in the James Bond series, sadly, this remake, ""Never Say Never Again"" is nowhere close to its predecessor. In fact this is all just a ploy to get producer Kevin McClory his feet wet at creating his own 007 adventure, which was a movie-making recipe for disaster. The story itself is lackadaisical at best. Just nothing more than a sad attempt to live up to the success of ""Thunderball"", which was proved unsuccessful. While in ""Thunderball"", the stolen nukes plot was deadpan believable, which can't be said in ""Never Say Never Again."" It's partially because in ""Never Say Never Again"" its attempt was to take a sixties movie and to juxtapose it to the present (1983 present that is). The final outcome makes it dated and has aged at a very high rate. The video game showdown between James Bond (Sean Connery) and Largo (Klaus Maria Brandauer) is a fine example of how dated this movie is.It's not an entirely bad movie overall. In fact the cast as a whole were pretty good including Sean Connery himself. My main complaint is that Connery, like the movie he made 12 years earlier ""Diamonds are Forever"" just doesn't fit the part of 007. Maybe it's just me, but I think he's just too old to play that role which kind of feels awkward to see him romancing younger women young enough to be his daughters. I still think her performed convincingly, but physically and age-wise, he just isn't right for that kind of part anymore.Like I said in spite of the trite story, I thought the acting was splendid. Klaus Maria Brandauer steals every scene he's in as Blofeld's #1 henchman Max Largo. Largo is a very convincing adversary to Bond. Max Von Sydow makes quite a believable Ernest Stavro Blofeld, but it's a shame he was only on for a few scenes which makes him not as good as Donald Pleasence and Telly Savalas who had also played Blofeld in other Bond pictures. Kim Basinger makes a formidable Domino but still does not exceed the one Claudine Auger portrayed in ""Thunderball"". Barbera Carrera does her best as Fatima Blush, but fails miserably at being original like Fiona Volpe was in the previous movie ""Thunderball"". Edward Fox will never be Bernard Lee's M, but he fit the role perfectly. It was sad the Desmond Llewelyn's was absent here as Q, but Alec McGowen turned in a wonderful performance just the same. The sets are a sight for sore eyes. And the fight scenes were brilliantly choreographed. The motorcycle chase scenes will have the action guru begging for more and the underwater battle is as exciting as they come. The only complaint I have is that a score was missing at times. I think with some music in the background could've added some texture to the scenes which was desperately needed because it makes the action scenes flow faster, otherwise the scenes just drag. Okay, so ""Never Say Never Again"" won't score any points in originality; after all it's a remake. And like remakes past and present, it never succeeds like their predecessors.",Never Say Never Again
64,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"Watered down and diluted copy of the original, Thunderball",2,15 March 2014,"It's overlong, and it's a remake (of a film based on a book, which itself was based on an unfilmed screenplay) so we mostly know what's going to happen from square one, but Sean Connery seems more into it than he'd been since Thunderball, and that alone makes this film worth watching (for a little while, at least) But the rest of the supporting cast is terrible, and the film just goes on forever.The opening gambit is good, with Connery back, and in good form as Bond, apparently rescuing a hostage from her captors, which raises one's hopes for this film-- but then the rug is pulled out from underneath us and we are basically told ""just kidding,"" as it turns out to be a routine training exercise.Edward Fox (who is horrible) is M. this time around, overacting outrageously. He seems to think this is a drawing room comedy, as he rails against Bond's indulgent lifestyle, eventually ordering him to a health spa to get back into shape.Here is one of the few interesting lines of dialogue, as Bond explains, ""Since you've taken over the double-O section, I spend most of my time teaching, not doing"" That bit implies that Bond has been at least semi-retired for a while, and is a bit frustrated by that. Unfortunately, after that brief moment, and M.'s terrible response, it is never touched on again. Instead, it's off to Shrubland's, where (after lame jokes) we get a good fight scene between Bond and Lippe- but it goes on too long, it ends as inanely as possible, and we realise that it was little more than an attempt at cloning Jaws, from The Spy Who Loved Me.By the time the real plot finally begins, were are already about twenty minutes into the film.Once again, the fate of the world is at stake when nuclear warheads are stolen and held up for ransom, and it is up to Bond to track them down and prevent their use. The bombs are in one place (the Bahamas, again) but the film feels obligated to do the required globetrotting (to France, and north Africa, then back to the Bahamas) to compete with the other Bond films which do the same.Partway through, we get a decent enough motorcycle chase, but we later see Bond basically playing a video game in a casino, in one of the most baffling scenes.To make matters even worse, Klaus Maria Brandauer is a weak villain, Kim Basinger is an equally lame heroine, and Barbara Carrera leaves little impression either. Rowan Atkin's scenes are probably the film's worst moments, and that says a lot.After waiting the court-ordered twelve years to attempt a remake of his collaboration with Ian Fleming, screenwriter Kevin McClory's remake of his co-owned novel, and film, Thunderball, amounts to little more than Bond clichés, a couple of good action scenes, and lots of filler material. Ironically, by trying to update the original story, McClory has drifted further away from its source material, taking it off into some TV-movie-looking drawing room comedy with only a few widely spaced action scenes.Nevermind the missing gun barrel opening, or the title sequence, or theme song, or any of the rest of the formula; that is minutia. McClory finally had a chance to make his own Bond film, and do it his own way, but it turns out that he has nothing original in mind, and ends up simply imitating the other, ""official"" Bond pictures.",Never Say Never Again
65,Gislef,Did We Need a Remake?,7,31 December 1998,"NSNA is an entertaining enough movie.  Almost entirely due to a hugely eccentric performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer - he's a three-dimensional villain in a way that only the few great Eon/Bond supervillains (Goldfinger, Scaramanaga, Zorin) truly are.  Compare Brandauer's Largo to the original, or even later bad guys like Drax and Stromberg, and you'll see what I mean.Connery is also good, and for the amount of money he's being paid, he's obviously having fun.But basically, NSNA is an updated-for-the-80s remake of Thunderball.  Now, I consider that original somewhat of a long bore myself, but I don't see any reason why we needed a remake, even a marginally superior one.  It's like the producers here felt that they had to do everything that much bigger and better that sometimes they go overboard.  Sometimes that's good (Brandauer's performance, and sometimes its bad (the overblown action sequences).Plus, as was noted elsewhere, there's a kind of ""So There!"" attitude towards the Eon/Bond flicks, a kind of smug pat-on-the-head attitude that seems to leak through. Just because NSNA is better than Thunderball, and you've got Connery rather than Moore, doesn't make NSNA better than _every_ other JB movie.  There's an attitude here as if NSNA _is_ the best Bond film ever. Sorry - stuff like Goldfinger still beat it out.",Never Say Never Again
66,shakercoola,"Muted actioner, but watchable for its trace of spoof",5,1 July 2019,"An American spy fantasy; A story about a British government agent assigned to recover two cruise missiles with live nuclear warheads which have been stolen by a secret organisation called S.P.E.C.T.R.E. which intends to detonate them.
Based on the novel ""Thunderball"", this is an entertaining action flick. The dialogue is witty and crisp, and the action is imaginative.
Sean Connery is charming as the suave spy with the throwaway style of humour, broadened to accommodate an older, seasoned man of stature.
However, while the film's script is tight to its story, it suffers for attempting to concentrate on character presence. As a result, the pacing is a bit too leisurely, and combined with a light tone there is virtually no tension in the scenes which lead to a rushed climax. Max Von Sydow is unconvincing as the sinister force behind an evil enterpise; Rowan Atkinson ungainly plays for laughs, and Edward Fox mugs the camera with his overcrusty spy chief. Nevertheless, Barbara Carreras gives a Golden Globe nominated performance as a femme fatale. Klaus Maria Brandauer is a good match for OO7 as a neurotic megalomaniac.",Never Say Never Again
67,coltras35,Never say never again,8,25 September 2021,"Never say never again, a non-Eon Film featuring the first Bond Sean Connery, was the reason why Albert Broccoli agreed to pay Moore big money for Octopussy, as Broccoli knew that the competition was stiff, and now was not time to hire a new actor to play Bond.The story-James Bond comes out of retirement and finds himself having to get back into shape to confront archenemies Blofeld and Largo, and foil a plot to hold the world to ransom using nuclear weapons.A remake of Thunderball, Never say Never again doesn't follow the 1965 film's plot exactly, and though it's not as good either, it's lavish, has some glib lines ""my martini is dry""), Barberra Carrera makes a great villainess and Kim Basinger, though not as hot as Claudine Auger ( the original Domino), is quite good. So is the main villain, who has traces of a psychotic behaviour. As for Connery, he looks older ( I like older heroes; most actors playing heroes in the 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's were 40plus, and besides, James Bond, as a literary character is past his 60's!!), but much more charming as he returns to the role that made him famous and does a good job, but he doesn't give the eyebrow-raising one ( Moore) or Broccoli sleepless nights with what purists thought would be a return to the ultra-serious, rough and tumble Bond of his early years. Actually, Connery is much lighter, tongue-in-cheek and less aggressive. I liked him here and in his last three EON Bonds where's he's less of a bull in a China cup.Never say never again can be a bit slow in the first half, but overall it's good fun, has some good action scenes such as the bike chase sequence and the underwater finale sequence) and a good title track that is quite jazzy and dreamy.",Never Say Never Again
68,RNMorton,Never say never,9,4 February 2017,"I loved the Bond films of the 60s, particularly You Only Live Twice and Diamonds are Forever (the last two for Sean on his first run). I think Connery is the one and only Bond, he made the role his own even if Fleming had something a little different in mind. But looking back the really early Bonds were a little slow to develop and don't age so well. And the Moore Bonds are not watchable for me at this point. Which is why this may now be my favorite Bond movie. Sean is back, self-assured as always, this time there is a lot going on and many scenic locales to visit. Basinger is a solid Bond girl, Carrera is made for the femme fatale role, Brandauer is a little weak but somewhat effective in a delicate sort of way. The basic plot has been done a million times before but it's great to see Connery one more time in his most famous role.",Never Say Never Again
69,mentalcritic,At least they tried,7,29 June 2005,"Bond films can generally be divided into three categories, depending on their merit. There's the good, there's the bad, and there are those that starred Roger Moore. After watching this attempt to remake Thunderball, I am convinced that so long as they try to make a good Bond film, the result will never truly be bad. Less impressive entries in the series like The World Is Not Enough seem to back me up on this theory, while true stinkers like Die Another Day certainly confirm that the method of serving crap up because the fans will eat it anyway makes for some lousy films. Never Say Never Again falls somewhere in the middle. It is not the steaming pile that rabid Moore fanboys seem to want to claim it is, but it is not the sort of compelling drama that On Her Majesty's Secret Service or Licence To Kill proved to be, either. It is ironic that with all the plots about world domination or the irradiation of oil supplies, Bond works best when the story is a personal matter.Never Say Never Again begins with a theme song that proves the pre-GoldenEye rule. Basically, before GoldenEye, the quality of the film would be inversely reflected in the theme song. There are notable exceptions in the form of Goldfinger, but Never Say Never Again's theme is dated enough to make other British productions such as Zulu seem timeless. In any case, once the theme song is over, we are introduced to an MI6 that is run by a health nut M who insists that Bond go to a health spa to improve his fitness. As if years of working in the field would not have done that already. Physically, Sean Connery looks more than fit enough to play the part, but he is showing his age. The rest of the cast, with the notable exceptions of a bumbling Rowan Atkinson and a young Kim Basinger, will barely be recognisable to today's audiences. Max von Sydow notwithstanding, I doubt that they were recognisable to the audiences of the 1980s, for that matter.Since Never Say Never Again is a remake of Thunderball, it inherits all of Thunderball's problems. The central premise of nuclear weapons being stolen and used to extort billions of dollars from NATO is enough of a stretch to credulity. How these weapons are acquired is just plain idiotic. A member of SPECTRE somehow manages to get and keep a US Air Force pilot addicted to heroin. In spite of the rigorous health checks that all medium-ranking military personnel supposedly undergo. Even if you discount this improbability, the surgery that this pilot undergoes to have a clone of the President's retina implanted absolutely beggars belief. I am surprised that the manner in which the pilot's bandaging cannot be covering much is not listed in the Goofs section. But getting the source material to make a replica of the President's retina, which would have been impossible in 1983 anyway, would have been the mother of all challenges. That the film does not create an adequate pace to suspend disbelief at these moments hurts it badly.What Never Say Never Again has that Goldfinger and From Russia With Love, to cite two of the most-often referenced early Bond films, lack is ambition. The sky was the limit as far as director Irvin Kershner was concerned, and he did not mind stretching the budget in order to achieve his aims. The video game sequence is a diversion, and totally unnecessary, but it injects some excitement into what would otherwise be a very ordinary montage of scenes. We have seen Bond sit down and have a chin-wag with his nemesis before. What I have not seen since Goldfinger is Bond engaging in a friendly recreation with his opponent that has sinister overtones. Sure, the scene is not without its problems, many of which are common to films with similar sequences in from this era. About the only film of this era that uses video games to drive a scene and does not suffer from the writer's imagination getting carried away would be Tron.Bond girls can make or break a Bond film. Famke Janssen, while not being the only thing that made GoldenEye an immortal classic, elevated it to heights of memorability that no other Bond film has achieved before or since. Teri Hatcher, on the other hand, made Tomorrow Never Dies so pathetic that it has the same connotations to me that Freddy's Revenge does to Nightmare On Elm Street fans. Never Say Never Again shows Kim Basinger in a rare fit of acting well. Barbara Carrera does well with the character of Fatima Blush, but the script lets her down with a distinct lack of memorable scenes. This was long before the trend of recent years to make the women in an action film more than something to come home to, so it is hardly surprising, but still disappointing in a modern context. After Janssen's aforementioned performance, however, a Bond girl could act out a modern Joan Of Arc and still be disappointing, so take that assessment with the appropriate grain of salt. Rowan Atkinson could also be considered an entry into the Bond Girl contingent, his character is soft and wimpy enough. I realise he is not meant to be a heroic super agent like Bond, but I think they got a little carried away here.I gave Never Say Never Again a seven out of ten. It is far from the best Bond film, but given that the Moore stable only had Octopussy and A View To Kill left in it at the time, it proves that Sean Connery was still the best man to play Bond. About the only man to get into the role he couldn't have taught a thing or two was the impeccable Timothy Dalton. Even if it is just for curiosity's sake, see Never Say Never Again at least once.",Never Say Never Again
70,Beta_Gallinger,"Never say never again...actually, maybe that's not very good advice",5,14 December 2008,"Sean Connery, the first actor to portray James Bond on the silver screen, last appeared in the official EON Productions Bond franchise in the 1971 film, ""Diamonds Are Forever"", which unfortunately turned out to be one of the weaker Bond films. Although he never returned to the official franchise after that, he returned as Ian Fleming's character twelve years later, in this unofficial (meaning it's not from EON Productions) Bond film, ""Never Say Never Again"" (a remake of the official ""Thunderball"" from 1965), which was released the same year as the official ""Octopussy"", Roger Moore's sixth outing as Bond. Unfortunately, both 1983 Bond films turned out to be pretty weak.After James Bond fails a field training exercise, M feels the agent has too many free radicals, and sends him to a health farm so he can eliminate them. At this health farm, Bond hears a nurse attack her patient and goes to spy on them, and soon after this, an attempt on Bond's life is made in the gym! Obviously, both of these things make 007 suspicious, and he has the right to be, as operatives from the criminal organization, S.P.E.C.T.R.E., run by Ernst Stavro Blofeld, are in this health farm! So, Bond's stay at this spa is cut short, as S.P.E.C.T.R.E. has stolen two nuclear warheads, and the agent must set out to pursue the evil Maximilian Largo and retrieve the warheads before they are set off! The unofficial 1967 version of ""Casino Royale"" is a spoof, whereas this second unofficial Bond film is apparently not supposed to be, though it does seem like it at times. A great example I can think of is the fight scene at the health farm, which sometimes seemed a tad comical to me. Not that the entire film seems like a parody, but it often does early in the film, and that's not its only problem. Alec McCowen's portrayal of Q is forgettable, unlike Desmond Llewelyn's portrayal of the character, which he played for over three decades. Incoherence is another problem with this film at times, I believe, and I think I sometimes looked at the screen with a puzzled face. More still, Fatima Blush, a villain who works for S.P.E.C.T.R.E., seemed a little too absurd to me. With all those flaws and maybe more, ""Never Say Never Again"" is an overall boring flick, a lot like the non-EON Productions film from 1967, even though it's not quite the same idea.Unfortunately, the 80's were not a very good decade for Bond films. By then, Roger Moore's best films in the franchise were behind him. Like I said, ""Octopussy"" and ""Never Say Never Again"" are both fairly weak Bond films, and so is ""A View to a Kill"", Moore's final outing as Agent 007, which came two years later. I would say the best one of the 80's is ""The Living Daylights"", from 1987, the first of two starring Timothy Dalton, which I think is pretty good, but even that one can't match the best of every other decade. So, at a time when the official Bond movie franchise was in a bit of a slump, this second of two unofficial films, outside of the main series, probably didn't help. After Sean Connery left the official series with the lacklustre ""Diamonds Are Forever"", ""Never Say Never Again"" could have been one last chance for him to go out with a bang, but sadly, the film just wasn't crafted well enough for that to happen.",Never Say Never Again
71,vip_ebriega,A second look: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN.,6,12 May 2010,"I actually loved NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN when I saw it for the first time. It is after all Sean Connery's real final take on the James Bond role (but is usually exempted since NSNA was never really part of the EON Productions package). He has aged a lot since the public last saw him as Bond... James Bond, and it clearly shows. The movie itself establishes this fact by having Bond attend a health spa early in the movie so that he be back in tip-top shape to save the world again when two nuclear warheads are stolen by the ever-present organization of terror SPECTRE. Anyway, it's really a remake of THUNDERBALL (it's even made by the people who did the original), only modified a little to fit the subplot involving Bond coming out of retirement.Seeing it many times before, I've always learned to suspend my disbelief when the older Connery does stunts that his younger self used to do. After all, I was able to buy an elderly Roger Moore in OCTOPUSSY and A VIEW TO A KILL. But seeing it again recently, it was clear that the real flaw wasn't Connery's aging. The movie itself hasn't entirely aged well. While I still kinda like it, and I enjoyed it more than his inferior DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, but like that one, Connery is one of the chief reasons to see it. There are a number of other good things to say about it, beginning with Klaus Maria Brandauer's performance as Largo. While THUNDERBALL was superior in anyway, the Largo in that one paled in comparison to this one which was much more intriguing and menacing.. and he doesn't even need an eye patch to hint at his malice.Unfortunately, not everything was nearly as good as I used to think. The Bond girls are surprisingly weak, even if one of them happens to be Kim Basinger. Basinger doesn't do much as Domino, other than being completely gorgeous (the Tango scene was the best moment of her in the entire film). On the other hand, bad Bond girl played by Barbara Carrera hams it ups just too much that it almost becomes irritating. Not to mention those things she wears! It certainly hasn't aged well. Another quibble would be the requisite change of talents. It's a little off-putting to see a number of familiar faces (M, Q, Moneypenny) being played by unfamiliar faces and even in alternate names (here, Q is referred to as ""Algy"", and that's not even his real name). The music was OK at best, cheesy at worst; I prefer Barry's works.NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a pretty mediocre entry in the series, it even goes on too long (by the time it reaches the third act, I felt that the film has lost much of its gas), but it wasn't bad. Actually, it was much better than some of the mediocre entries in the official franchise. Worth watching, mostly for Connery's final performance as Bond (MR. BEAN fans will also want to check out Rowan Atkinson's first ever role).Rating: *** out of 5.",Never Say Never Again
72,one9eighty,Vodka on the rocks??,5,26 August 2020,"Right then, let's get this out of the way, ""Never Say Never Again"" is not an official Bond per say, despite the fact that it uses the Bond character and characters in the Bond universe. Sean Connery reprises his role as the super spy that he last played in 1967 (12 years prior to this film). This is his 7th time playing the Bond role, the last outing being ""Diamonds are Forever"". He was 52 years old in this, which was still 3 years younger than Roger Moore who was playing official Bond in Eon's ""Octopussy"" (released in the same year). The title of the film is a nod to the fact that Connery said he would never play Bond again, his wife joked; ""never say never again"", and that was then adopted for the title. As far the content of the film goes, this is an unapologetic remake of the 1965 ""Thunderball"" film which Connery also starred in, updated for a modern 80's audience.So, how did this come about then? What makes it not official? Well for a start it was not made by Albert R. Broccoli's Eon Productions but by Jack Schwartzman's Taliafilm in association with Kevin McClory. One of the original writers of ""Thunderball"", Kevin McClory retained the filming rights of the novel following a legal battle in the 1960's. It was released via Warner Brothers and to its audiences this felt more of an American Hollywood style action film rather than the British Eon Bond films. As it was a remake of ""Thunderball"" you may already know the plot, but here goes anyway...Long-time Bond nemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld's S.P.E.C.T.R.E. organisation steals two nuclear warheads. Bond is ordered to investigate which eventually leads him to suspect Maximilian Largo of involvement. Largo happens to be high-ranking S.P.E.C.T.R.E agent. Along the way he works with various covert agencies, including working with Felix Leiter of the CIA, one of his long-term friends. Together they attempt to get the warheads, in order to defuse them and the threat that S.P.E.C.T.R.E. poses to the world.I have mentioned that Connery returns to the role of Bond, and in fairness he does good. He is one of my favourite Bond's and his performance is no worse than the then current Bond, Roger Moore. That is despite both being relatively too old to be double-o agents - according to MI6 suggestions in other films. There are times where Connery looks like he is enjoying himself, something that seemed to fade from his original run as the spy. Perhaps seeing how Moore was playing the role; relaxed with a bit of swagger and a lot of fun, relaxed Connery in the role a little too. There was talk that it was the money he was earning that made him smile, this could be partly true - but a lot of that money was put to good charitable use too. He donated a large proportion of it to education and the arts in Scotland. Klaus Maria Brandauer is Maximilian Largo, which is based on Emilio Largo character in the original version of the film, just a different name - he too does a great job in his performance. His performance in ""Mempisto"" (1981) sold it to the producers here, and they were rewarded with a performance which is as good as any Bond villain to date. Playboy model Barbara Carrera plays Fatima Blush, who was Fiona Volpe (S.P.E.C.T.R.E. #12) in the original. She actually turned down a part in ""Octopussy"" because she wanted to be in a Connery/Bond film. Kim Basinger plays the beautiful Domino Petachi, Largo's girlfriend. She is great in her second major cinematic outing (after 1981's ""Hard Country"") - her 'assets' in particularly command a lot of screen time and probably needed their own agent after this film. Rowan Atkinson is in the film as a light-relief character of Nigel Small-Fawcett - not my favourite character, but a role which he can use for inspiration with his (2003) ""Johnny English"" films. In the reoccurring characters, Max von Sydow plays Blofeld, Edward Fox is M, and Pamela Salem is Miss Moneypenny. It is worth mentioning, that for the first time a black actor played the reoccurring role of Felix Leiter (in this it was Bernie Casey). This was thanks to Connery's suggestion, and as it happens this is something that would eventually be repeated in the Daniel Craig run of Bond films some 30+ years later. All-in-all it is a good cast and strong cast that do the film credit.Made with a budget of $36 million this did well, earning $160 million back at the box office. It was not quite as profitable as the official Bond film ""Octopussy"" though, which cost $27.5 million and gained $187.5 million. On it's release this film actually did well with critics and fans too, they generally thought it was a decent film, still shy of the likes of ""Dr No"" and ""Goldfinger"" which seemed to be everyone's favourites - but good all the same.For me, I enjoyed this. It does not matter if it was made by Eon or Taliafilm, it was still a decent adventure film. Watching the run of Bond films one after the other and then getting to this film allowed me to reflect on how much I enjoyed Connery in the role. It is like taking a quick look in a photo album, before getting back to the reality of Moore wearing the tuxedo. It is a little softer on action than recent Bond films of the era, but it's good for character development and dialogue. There is a nice script, and considering it's an update of ""Thunderball"", it still feels fresh and exciting. I enjoyed it, and controversially, I do add it to any list of Bond film's when asked.In terms of Bond films this is a 6/10 from me. In terms of films in the history of cinema it is a 5/10.",Never Say Never Again

However, the absolute WORSE thing NSNA does is demythologizes the 007 legend.  MI6 is presented as a barely competent organization led by a snotty dullard and populated by clueless klutzes.  Connery generally lucks his way through this one, outsmarted at almost every turn by the baddies, only to barely escape, always by some far fetched, almost idiotic method  (one almost indestructible `killing machine' is dispatched by a urine sample, I kid you not.)A better title for `Never Say Never Again' would be `Never Again'.

77,eminkl,"By that point, it's already obvious that not even James Bond can pull out of this tailspin",5,17 April 2020,"After a dozen years of sabbatical, Sean Connery slips into an old tuxedo, wraps his fist around a cold martini and reclaims the role of James Bond for one last lap around the racetrack. Connery looks rather gray for the part, but neither he nor the filmmakers shy away from that. Rather, he's portrayed as an old spy come out of retirement, with a renewed reliance on gadgets and sneaky tricks in lieu of dust-ups or more physical slices of action. That's admirably honest, particularly in contrast to Eon's stubborn insistence that fifty-six year old Roger Moore was not an older man at all, and it might've paid off, had the ensuing film shown any sense of style or panache. Instead, Never Say Never Again is thoroughly safe, flat and workmanlike, as though it were already looking forward to cashing checks for the sequel. There's no fire to the plot, no energy to the performances. Sir Sean seems perfectly content to let his mere presence do all the work, showing no sign of the magnetic, charismatic personality that once made him so irresistible. Much of the film's structure feels silly and out-of-date, too, perhaps reaching for familiar material to put the aging superstar at ease. Even the big set pieces land with a thud. How is it possible for a jetpack chase to feel so boring? Grinding through the last hour is a terrible chore, drug out and underwhelming as it is. By that point, it's already obvious that not even James Bond can pull out of this tailspin.",Never Say Never Again
78,The_Movie_Cat,Never Say Never Use The Same Plot Again,4,28 August 1999,"After claims of production problems, Never Say Never Again wasn't released until the autumn, by which time it no longer had a fair chance against the summer box office of Octopussy. Perhaps this was fear on behalf of the producers, who illogically worried about placing the most popular Bond against the current, official, incumbent. Never Again cost $36 million to make against Octopussy's comparatively small $27.5, yet grossed just $51 million against the former's $81.4. Mention of budget seems laughable, as Octopussy features a number of exotic locations, where the expensive Never Say inexplicably looks and feels like a t.v. movie. Even more bizarre, what were then state-of-the-art computer effects to simulate nuclear missiles have dated much faster than the Thunderball effects on which the movie is based. Yet commerce never really counted as a judge of quality, and it must be said that as Bond Connery is generally the better of the two. Apart from the basic techniques of acting, there is the standard requirements of the role: sex appeal and physical ability. Lazenby, despite his limitations as an actor, was the best at stunt work, though Sean comes a close second. As if to prove this, both he and Moore go full-out in these '83 vehicles, hanging onto planes and cartwheeling on motorbikes like the ageing and infantile men they are. As for the sex appeal, the decrepit Moore once again lives off his status as the original Saint, despite the fact that he can now be mistaken for Desmond Llewellyn in a bad light. Sean, I'm told, still has his sex appeal, even to date.However, comparison of the two on such a scale is chiefly unwarranted: their playing of the part is completely at odds; Sean often straight, sometimes ironic, Roger self-referential. Plus, it must be noted that Sean had far, far better material. This last point does not hold up here, though: Never Say Never Again is a relic dragged out of time, a Bond who thought it was manly to hit women, dusted down and posted opposite Kim Basinger in an anachronistic 80's. Here a dated Bond rejigs the plot of ""Thunderball"" so that he faces the villain (Largo, well played by Klaus Maria Brandauer) not across a roulette table but over a video game. So out-of-touch are the producers with advances in the film industry, that they have action scenes punctuated by light jazz interludes. Fine for Connery's work in the sixties, desperately out of date here. Octopussy, on the other hand, has the most jingoistic 007 travelling in a Union Jack balloon and tipping Indians with the appallingly racist line ""that should keep you in curry"". Yet while Sean sleepwalks through his lines, Roger is on top form, draining every last groan out of the crushing puns, such as telling a snake to ""hiss off!""Roger's movie does have it's faults, such as a tacky sex opening title, and a performance from Steven Berkoff that is so over the top it nearly drags the whole film down with it. (Why don't the producers of Bond films hire actual Russians to play Russians? Other notable examples are From Russia With Love and Goldeneye). Yet this was never a year for SERIOUS, well-constructed Bonds, and Sean's film is equally guilty of excess. The humour in Never Say... is particularly forced and self-conscious, mainly involving Rowan Atkinson (now infamous as Mr.Bean) lisping and playing a green secret agent. There is also a lame scene where the improbably-named Fatima Blush tries to force Bond at gunpoint to admit she is the best lover he has ever had.As for the ""trimmings"" of the film, Pamela Salem makes a good Moneypenny, while Bernie Casey makes his mark as a black Felix Leiter. Less successful are Kim Basinger, who appears to be only in the film to wear transparent tops, and Alec McCowen as a Cockney hypochondriac version of ""Q"". (The ""real"" Q in Octopussy illogically spends most of his time in the field, but this can be largely overlooked). Perhaps the best thing about the film not being an ""official canon"" 007 outing is that it means the desperately lame theme song will never appear on a James Bond soundtrack album. With Octopussy, Rita Coolidge's underrated song (which never references the provocative film title) is a real find and contrasts beautifully.Never Say is underrated in that it scores over Thunderbore by having that movie's desperately slow narrative sped up, though this does mean that it's exposition is replaced by irrelevant set-pieces. Yet some of those set-pieces, such as the shark chase and the motorbike stunts, are extremely well constructed. In comparison, Octopussy has one of the most complex and modern plots yet. For once, Connery never bothers to act in his film, relying entirely on reputation and caricature to carry the movie, and as a result is out-acted by the original plank himself, Roger Moore. In desperation, Sean even tries raising his eyebrow, Moore-style, on a number of occasions, but to no avail. It seems that the Bond franchise has finally outgrown him. Film-per-film, Connery easily outclasses Moore. But in a not-so-vintage year when Sean made us yawn, Roger pulled out all the stops, be it a digital watch-wearing gorilla, or a bomb-defusing clown, making it Roger 1, Sean 0.",Never Say Never Again
79,The_Movie_Cat,A pale imitation of the real thing,4,2 September 2001,"With all the legal wrangling between Kevin McClory and the Bond copyright holders you'd be forgiven for forgetting that his one story is actually the most tedious of the entire series. A remake of Thunderball, which was at least well made, Never Say Never Again has indifferent direction and pretty dire editing. It's the little things, like hearing a splash before a man hits the water that betray the sloppiness of the production. The outdated plot is told through a series of muted comic setpieces and characters. Perhaps chief of which is Rowan Atkinson as Small-Fawcett, a green agent with a lisp. Maybe this dubious humour would have worked, had Connery's own impediment not vastly increased in the 12 years since Diamonds are Forever. Every time Rowan speaks you can see Sean thinking, ""are you taking the pishhh?"" I've nothing against people with speech difficulties, but seeing the world's coolest secret agent asking for a Vodka Martini ""Shhhhhhhhaken not shhhhhhhhtirred"" just blows the mystique.
There's a large quota of sexism, with a decrepit 007 still doing the Romeo bit. Is this a Bond film or just a parody of Bond films? The scene where Barbara Carrera forces James at gunpoint to admit she was his best lover is particularly childish. Pity poor Kim Basinger, who tries hard in the middle of all the smugness and must wish she could say she was an official Bond girl. But then so must Lani Hall, who gets the title song, a crummy affair, the weakest of all 007 themes. The alternate versions of the regular characters - Q, M and Felix Leiter - are a nice touch in theory, though Edward Fox's M is just a cursory stereotype. Alec McCowen's sinus-blocked Q is another misjudged comic creation on a par with Atkinson's, leaving Bernie Casey to score as a black Leiter. Updating the format so that Largo is a collector of arcade machines is an okayish idea, but ultimately at odds with Bond's old-fashioned Imperialism. As a result, 007's confrontation with Largo opposite a video game seems to lack the implied psychological conflict... machismo over cards I can understand, butch swagger over a glorified game of Pac Man just belittles both parties. Most of the scenes seem irrelevant and, like the original, distract from the main thrust of the plot. Sean's still playing goosey in the shower with Basinger during the last half an hour, when things should be hotting up. There's no urgency or immediacy; the film never gets out of first gear. Throughout it all, the nuclear warhead element seems shunted to a subplot, there as a distraction from puns and innuendo. At least Klaus Maria Brandauer makes an effort as Largo and adds some gravitas to the otherwise flat scenario. I quite liked this one on first viewing, and it is reasonable as throwaway entertainment, but clearly inferior to any of the official canon. A self-satisfied Connery never gets his head out of his own backside long enough to act, while the half-hearted, uncertain production fails to fully engage. An outmoded relic, the Bond franchise had outgrown Sean and no longer needed him, while his final wink to camera is just pure cheese. Next time say never again... and mean it.",Never Say Never Again

83,Pedro_H,"Ageing, creaking, wheezing and production-troubled - but passable entertainment.",6,17 September 2017,"As a only a casual Bond fan I wasn't put off by the word ""remake"" because, after all, aren't all Bonds a form of remake? Certainly up to this point in time anyway! Connery has got himself down the gym for this one, but looks every one of his fifty plus years and then some. Thankfully the stuntmen do most of the work meaning a lot of the time he is wearing a helmet, headscarf, wet-suit or photographed from an obscure angle. Can always tell though - the stunt-man's hair moves while Connery's doesn't.(It is said that the original script included a scene where Bond puts the toupee on!) Listen you know the score or you are very young indeed. Man wants to take over the world, the sexy girl (or two) comes along before they face the ticking bomb. Kim Bassinger looks fabulous with a fantastic figure, but what shocking dancer! Gets her in to a leotard (and I am not complaining), but what a baby elephant.Can't even do a 360 turn! As per usual she looks vaguely disinterested in anything and everything - but there was an Oscar in it down the road so keep going darling! The logic of Bond is that he is sometimes very smart (knows how to operate secret equipment with no training!) and other times very stupid. Gets captured very easily, indeed doesn't seem to mind too much when he does. Usually there is a nice meal in it for him.Baddie No.1 Klaus Maria Brandauer isn't too shabby and plays the psychopathy quite well. Practicing for a better movie with a smaller paycheck maybe? Barbara Carrera is actually quite good, an assassin with bad taste in fashion, but a nice looking girl who looks like she can do mean. Even though Bond never cares who gets killed - as long as it is not him - so why is she bothering? Box office wise didn't do as well as the other ""official"" Bond of the day (Octopussy) and you can see why. Still, good enough for Sunday afternoon.

Its a shame I was too young to appreciate the significance of two Bond film releases in one year (Octopussy was released in June 1983 starring Roger Moore).The EON/MGM/Moore film won the day in terms of box office gross and on reflection is a better film.",Never Say Never Again
85,qormi,Never Ever Have I Seen Such Crap,1,16 October 2006,"This film followed the same plot as ""Thunderball"", so it was basically a remake. The opening sequence was ludicrous, as James Bond was revealed to have been training for a commando raid instead of actually accomplishing one. The entire movie, when compared with ""Thunderball"", seemed very cheesy in every regard. ""Thunderball"" was possibly the best Bond flick . It seemed to have a big budget, was very well cast, and was well-paced. ""Never Say Never Again"" was lacking in each of these aspects. Even James Bond's jet pack seemed like a bargain basement model when compared to the one he wore in ""Thunderball"", filmed nearly twenty years earlier.This film was a horrible mess from beginning to end. Connery at 52 looked and acted like a man of 65. Kim Bassinger seemed to be on antidepressants; very heavily medicated. Barbara Carrera seemed to have zero sex appeal - just a big-mouthed, crabby slut. The part where the ""Flying Saucer"" (what a dumb name for a yacht, compared to the ""Disco Volante"" of ""Thunderball) took off from the Caribbean to the Middle East was so dumb. Bond using a wristwatch laser to free himself from handcuffs was so juvenile. Above all, hot young women swooning over sixtyish-looking Connery was ridiculous. Yeah, I could see them being hot for him in 1965 when he was a stud, but he looks like the type of old geezer none of these women would even notice. The soundtrack sounded like music from a fashion show, rather than the James Bond themes we're used to. I will say that Bernie Casey was good as Felix Leiter. I will forever wonder how a James Bond flick could be such a laughably hideous piece of trash.",Never Say Never Again
86,timdalton007,"The Winner Of ""The Battle Of The Bonds""",8,17 August 2008,"1983 was ""the battle of the Bonds"". That year both Roger Moore and Sean Connery starred in two separate James Bond film, the former (Octopussy) was produced by the ""official"" makers of the Bond films while the later (Never Say Never Again) was produced ""unofficially"" by a group led by Kevin McClory who held the film rights to Thunderball. Surprisingly enough is the ""unofficial"" film that is better despite the obvious flaw of and the fact that Never Say Never Again is a remake of Thunderball.Never Say Never Again has the distinction of sporting one of the best casts ever assembled for a Bond film. It all starts with Sean Connery, returning to the play Bond for the first time since 1971's Diamonds Are Forever. Connery might be older then he was then but he looks better here then he did in Diamonds Are Forever. The Bond of Never Say Never Again is the sleek and dangerous shark of Dr. No or From Russia With Love, just a few years older. Connery's delivery of one liners and dialogue is as dead on as it ever was. The one downside to Connery's age is his believability, especially when it comes to the ladies of the film. Let's face it even Connery, despite being in top physical shape, looks as odd as Moore when he is bedding women half his age. Yet despite this believability issue, Never Say Never Again shows Connery in one of his better Bond performances and a definite improvement on his two earlier Bond performances.Kim Bassinger plays Domino in one of her early film roles. Bassinger plays the role with considerable confidence for a relative newcomer and she makes the character believable. Bassinger holds her own against her co-stars and has considerable chemistry with them as well. In fact she may well outshine her Thunderball counter-part played by Claudine Auger.Then there's the villain, Maximilian Largo played by Klaus Maria Brandauer. Brandauer's Largo is everything a James Bond film villain should be: suave, charming, evil and above all believable none the less. Brandauer makes the role realistic and chooses not to fall into the trap many other Bond villains have fallen into by going over the top. Brandauer plays Largo with a silent menace and charisma unseen in many adversaries of 007.The excellent cast extends into the supporting cast as well. Barbara Carrera makes a fine henchwoman in Fatima Blush and the screen lights up when she appears. Max Von Sydow a nice appearance as Blofeld, though his appearance is more akin to a cameo. Rowan Atkinson makes an appearance as Bond's bumbling contact that makes for some of the best scenes in the film. With all that the highlight of the supporting cast comes from the MI6 staff from Edward Fox's M who makes for a great contrast to Bernard Lee, Pamela Salem who make s affine Moneypenny and the icing on the cake with Alec McCowen's wonderful Q. The supporting cast has a couple of misfires though in the form of Bernie Casey as Felix Leiter and Gavin O'Herlihy as Jack Petachi who both seem to lack credibility in their respective roles. Otherwise this film sports one of the best casts ever assembled for a Bond film.On top of an excellent cast the film has several other essential ingredients. From the opening Central America sequence to the fight at Shrublands to the underwater sequences and motorbike chase, this is a film where the action sequences are not only great but service the plot as well for the most part. The film also sports good special effects in terms of cruise missile models, explosions, and all the things we expect from a Bond film. Irvin Kershner, then fresh off doing The Empire Strikes Back, brings a tight sense of direction to the film especially in sequences like the substation of nuclear warheads and the subsequent theft of the cruise missiles.Yet this film is far from perfect. Never Say Never Again is easily one of the most dated of the Bond films with its heavy use of 1980's computer sand video games. While technology dates any film after a time, this film's heavy reliance on it, especially in the hijacking of the cruise missiles and the Domination sequence makes the film look incredibly dated some quarter of a century after its release. The script also tends to suffer from predictability due to the very fact it's a remake of Thunderball.Yet for its predictability the script for Never Say Never Again is pretty good. The script sports good dialogue scenes, not a single cringe worthy one liner (how many of the Roger Moore era scripts can you say that about?), some humorous situations, and yet is watchable and tense for the most part. Once you look past he fact that it's a remake, there's quite a lot of good things in the script for the film.Music is in fact the biggest weakness of the film. Due to the ""unofficial"" status of the film, the James Bond Theme could not be used. That said this could have shown with the right composer that a Bond score without it could work. Unfortunately Michael Legrand's score is far from adequate. Legrand's score is totally out of place in a Bond film and there is only of or two places where it actually works. To make matters worse the film is also lumbered with one of the worst title sequences ever to grace a James Bond film.Despite being heavily dated, somewhat predicable, and having a bad score Never Say Never Again is still a good Bond film. With one of the best casts of any Bond film, good action sequences, good special effects, good direction, and some terrific dialogue, this film proves that ""unofficial"" isn't a bad thing. In fact it is is better then Octopussy and the winner of ""the battle of the Bonds"".",Never Say Never Again
87,Bogmeister,"BOND Plan B: renew Connery, remake Thunderball",6,11 August 2007,"MASTER PLAN: blackmail the world after stealing two nuclear warheads. Haven't we heard this plan before? Yes, in ""Thunderball""(65). And, wow, two Bond films in the same year (the other was ""Octopussy"") - what can it mean? This is now a curiosity in the Bond film series (and not a part of the canon series), an anomaly, an oddity, a film stemming from the real-life battles between Eon Productions and their nemesis, producer McClory, who won rights to remake the earlier film. It probably would have been better if he'd succeeded earlier - say, around 1976 or so; as it is, Connery, who managed to equal Roger Moore's number of Bond portrayals with this film, is a full dozen years older since his previous Bonder ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" and it shows. This isn't really a parody, like ""Casino Royale"" from 1967, though there are some too-cute moments, right up to the conclusion, a freeze-frame of Bond winking at us. There are also elements of a weird re-start, such as the first scene with Bond and M, who mentions he is new to the position, much like the Bond & female M scene in ""GoldenEye."" In this version, M (Fox) is still male, though he's a stuffy high-strung bureaucrat, opposed to double-0 agents, and looks a bit younger than Bond. This is a bit strange to take in, just on its own. Q is played by one of the best British actors, McCowen, so his scenes have a nice flair, though he has a silly name, Algernon.There's no teaser sequence or fancy credits such as we're used to - in fact, the beginning is so mundane, it's as if we're watching a typically substandard seventies thriller, with a wretched song and an awful score. Many of the early scenes are perfunctory; in other words, they're presented as the stuff we're used to seeing in a Bond film (Bond shoots bad guys, Bond is eyed by the ladies, Bond is menaced by sharks), but without the style and panache of the regular film series. As in ""Thunderball,"" Bond is sent to a health spa early in the film. In an early action scene, he's attacked by a brawny assassin/henchman in the 'Oddjob/Jaws' mold who seems unstoppable, and things appear to be picking up, until he's stopped by a silly gag. I admit I did laugh when I saw this in the theater way back when - but I don't nowadays. I also get the impression of a conspiracy by the producer to throw in some banal stuff amid the standard spy action, not helped any by what seems like in-joking involving Bond's aging hero bit, including M's comically shrill disapproval. It mirrors the problem with Moore in his last couple of Bonders, where the audience is laughing at the hero - undesirable conditions for a Bonder. Things seem to improve again in the middle half, as much of the action here is dominated by the female villain, Blush (actress Carrera in her best role). She exults in her performance as the persistent killer with some odd sexual preoccupations, anticipating the much later lethal ladies such as Onatopp in ""GoldenEye."" But, the best performance is by Brandauer as the main villain, Largo - a much different Largo than the one in ""Thunderball."" He's almost on another, superior level from the rest of the cast, suggesting insanity better than most other Bond villains, somewhat effeminate in some of his gestures, but also magnetic when sparring with Bond, especially in their memorably electrifying video game duel, a bizarre yet entrancing confrontation. Von Sydow, always good, has a much briefer role as famous uber-villain Blofeld, staying behind the scenes for most of the movie. Basinger as Domino the Bond girl is, unfortunately, similar to many of the Bond girls of that period: nice to look at, but usually helpless and kind of an airhead, though she demonstrates fear convincingly. Connery, looking his age (early fifties), goes through the motions here, but hey, it's still Connery as Bond; he can do this kind of thing in his sleep (which he nearly does) and is always watchable, with that easy charisma. The pace is actually pretty good for awhile up until the climactic shoot-out, in spite of some cheap production values. The finale, underwater with Largo, is murky stuff, with no tension, as if the filmmakers just gave up by this point and wanted to get it over with. We kind of forget what the threat is about half-an-hour before the end. Oh, and, Atkinson is his small role is abominable, like nails on chalkboard. Connery would not return.

The biggest problem about this film is having an ageing Sean Connery. He is just too old to convince the audience he is Bond, especially with the grey hair. His voice doesn't help either.Its also too hard to try and forget about the other Bond films at the same time. Their version of Moneypenny is too similar to Lois Maxwell, whilst M and Q are the complete opposites. In this Bond world, Q Brach looks like a junkyard and all the 00s have been retired.The music is OK for what's it's supposed to be, but don't expect any Bond sounds.

90,dfle3,"An interesting reboot...ditches boring bits from ""Thunderball""...",7,25 August 2010,"'14th' Bond movie (unofficial)The Sean Connery movies in the Bond series always seemed to have the attitude that only Connery was the 'real' Bond. That's why after the greatest Bond movie of them all (""On her majesty's secret service"" with George Lazenby as James Bond), the next movie - starring Connery, again - seemed to pretend that Lazenby never happened. And so it is with this movie...it's like Roger Moore never happened and nor will he. The narrative elements concluded by Moore (in, say, ""For your eyes only"") are ignored. For this reason the movie comes across to me as a one off Bond movie...I imagine that the novels always existed, but no movie had ever been made from them. ""Never say die"" seems like a ""What if?"" story. I.e. presuming knowledge of the existence of the novels, the movie imagines what happens to Bond near the end of his professional career. Of course, in some ways this movie is a remake of Connery's earlier ""Thunderball"" movie. Not exactly sure of the legal background to this movie, but I'm guessing that all the elements that were mostly author's Ian Fleming's have been removed and they've worked and reworked the elements that belong to the screenwriter of ""Thunderball"". It works. All those dull elements of ""Thunderball"" are gone...the underwater travelogue which just goes on and on. And on. Gone. Phew.Exotic locations: The Bahamas, Casino Royale in Monte Carlo Plot: MI6 is underfunded and under-appreciated by the British Government. Bond is now limited to training the new recruits to the spying game...and playing war games instead of doing actual spy work. His direct superior, ""M"", has little time for the ""00s"" and lets him know it. When evil organisation ""S.P.E.C.T.R.E"" steals two nuclear warheads, Bond just may get back on to active duty as a ""00"" agent.Franchise clichés: Pre title sequence - No. This movie faced legal challenges as Roger Moore was the encumbent James Bond. Moore's Bond movie - Octopussy - was in direct competition with this Connery movie and was released shortly before it. For this reason you don't the signature 'gun barrel' scene. Instead you get a 'flyscreen' effect with ""007"" wallpapering the screen. You also don't get Monty Norman's famous Bond theme music.Theme song - Still part of this movie. It's ""Never say never again"" and it's not bad. For the first time, I think, the singer doesn't credited at the start of the movie. You have to read the end credits for that...sung by Lani Hall and written by Heb Alpert. Sergio Mendez produced it. Song has a nice jazzy cocktail lounge vibe to it. Herb Alpert also plays the trumpet for this song...gives himself a solo to boot! Q - Yes...BUT, it's a new guy...""Algernon"". He has a touch of the Michael Caines to him. After the low point in the Bond and Q relationship in ""Octopussy"", it's quite a relief to see them chummy here. He has the line to Bond which I must have remembered from the promotional ad of ""I hope we are going to have some gratuitous sex and violence"". Bond misses the obvious rejoinder...something like ""You must buy me dinner first!"".M - Yes...BUT, again, it's a new guy. This M is a bit of a pompous arse and I really didn't enjoy being in his company throughout this movie.Moneypenny - Yes...but...you know the drill. Presumably there would have been legal problems if they tried to recruit the original actors who played these characters or if they had the same characters...explaining why M and Q are not only played by different actors in this movie, but are different people too.Silly female character names - Nigel Small-Fawcett. Played by Rowan Atkinson for comedic relief. Sorry, that's the only name that stuck out...good to see men being the butt of these jokes for once though! Misogyny/Wine snobbery/End teaser - A ""no"" to all these usual elements, I think...nothing obvious, at least.Watch for: * homing sharks! * Kim Bassinger's character's reaction after a massage...nice and subtle.* Bond smoking a cigar.* Ah...I knew there was a Bond movie where I saw a spittle bridge between two characters that were kissing...it's THIS movie! * an old Connery/Bond getting the kind of attention from beautiful young women that just doesn't seem right! * a Casino Royale full of arcade video games! Really? And Largo's inscrutable self-made video game...honestly, he should win every time just by virtue of being able to make heads or tails of it! * one reason to treat this movie as a one off...just check out Felix Leiter! Did he spend too long in the solarium? * some nice jokes...M mentioning ""free radicals"" and Moneypenny's reaction to Bond's line on this. As well as a funny scene I remembered the punch line to all these years later...where Bond has to give a urine sample to a nurse. Good-o! * end credit ""Thank ""A.K.""...presumably Arab brazilianaire Adnan Khashoggi.* Micheline Connery getting a credit for the title ""Never say never again"". Just looked her up on Wikipedia...Sean's wife.* Talia Shire Schwartzman getting an end credit too. Yes. ""Adrian!"".* The first Bond movie not to have been filmed at famous Pinewood studios? * This movie has different producers to the official Bond movies and it's based on an original story by McClory, Whittingham and Fleming.Note to self: - Domino mouths what to Bond after a shower and when M is on the phone? - ALCMs? - ""Mais doucement"" and ""ciaou bello""...mean? - Schubert's ""The trout"" is played here, I think. Significance? Conclusion...If you consider Sean Connery to the ONLY Bond, then this is a decent send off for him...not as silly as ""Diamonds are forever"".

92,willcundallreview,A sort of OK 007 spin off,6,19 April 2014,"Rating-6/10Never Say Never Again is a Bond spin off that although does not live up to the main series in anyway still manages to be alright and with Connery back albeit not at his past best, he still provides some of the things that made James Bond one of the household names of Cinema. I felt with this being the remake of Thunderball, maybe they will just do the exact same film but I was wrong and this is a different way of taking the story, good to watch though, I felt it was kind of OK, and here is why below.The story is of course Thunderball and the reason it is different in the way it is done is because they bring modern twists to it but also change the entire location and I respected it for that(even if for better or worse). The story is long and drawn out and one the reasons this doesn't get higher rated although I will say it never strays from what Bond is all about, it just lacks that certain fun and excitement we are so often promised. Finally on the plot you can see with Bond ageing, they give it a little build up where you feel they brought Bond out of retirement, this is good to see and as it can explain why such an old man is still performing well as a special agent.Connery is never as good as his past movies but gives this a good try and although he never makes that effort anymore than average, he still has the signs that so many love him for. I did feel acting in this wasn't so great and enjoying the overall plot hid the poor acting seen at times, Kim Basinger is one example as although I have seen worst Bond girl, she doesn't really get into the role well and never establishes character. Klaus Maria Brandauer in the return of Largo is OK and accompanies Connery well as the protagonist and antagonist respectively .I felt the writing was poor and never gets stuck into the story, it feels as if they are showing us that we already know what happened in the film so the script just doesn't matter. I did enjoy the stunts done and although maybe crazy, they are nowhere near as crazy as some of Roger Moore's at the same time as this movie, I did however think they should have had more and missed opportunities or cut down the time to avoid them.I think I have summed anything really wrong about this movie but one recurring thing that starts to nag away at you is just this, this just isn't like the main series of Bond and even slight little differences make a big change to what we usually see from Bond. It lacks the humour that Bond's around the late 70's, early 80's had and even the funny performance of Rowan Atkinson doesn't make this any funnier, although you may prefer it without humour so it could be OK.Bond fans I do feel may be disappointed by this, and whether true 007 fans consider this part of Bond's series of film that is up to them individually but they probably won't like this that much, but it isn't bad. Those who enjoy a good man tries to saves girl kind of action film and a villain who is kind of pure evil you will enjoy this as that is literally what it is on the tin, if you also like adventure also watch it as this is full of adventure and possibly one of the most travelling Bond's ever.Overall I give this a 6/10 meaning a Firmly Pretty OK movie, I said before this isn't a bad movie but is far from good also, little bits chip away at it throughout but if you try to watch it from a fun crime adventure perspective then you will enjoy it. I also think if you watch this with a love for Bond it is much better as it contains all the Bond trademarks( bar the theme tune and openings etc) and it shows a Bond we have of course seen before, Connery Bond fans I couldn't recommend this more.",Never Say Never Again
93,majikstl,"""Though I know there's danger there, I don't care """,8,6 August 2006,"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film. And even though NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is not technically part of the official Bond filmography, the mere presence of Sean Connery returning as 007 makes it something more than merely an honorary member of the series. Anyway, here's how it rates on a scale of 1 to 10: Title: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: The clever title has no apparent link to the actual storyline, but is instead an in-joke reference to Sean Connery's vow to never play OO7 again after having been lured back once before for DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Whatever the case, it is a catchy title. 8 points.Pre-Credit Teaser: Perhaps trying to avoid any obvious parallels to the official EON series of Bond films, there is no Teaser; the opening scenes are just shown behind the credits. And even that is disappointing: yet another ""oh-no, Bond has been killed"" fakeout. 4 points.Opening Credits: Other than a screen full of tiny 007's, they didn't even bother trying to jazz up the credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 points.Theme Song: As written by Michel LeGrand and sung by Lani Hall ""Never Say Never Again"" would make for a perfectly pleasant part of a particularly long elevator ride. As a Bond theme, it's merely okay. 6 points.""Bond, James Bond"": Appropriately, since this film sees Connery being lured back into service as Bond after a decade's hiatus, the story begins with 007 facing the question as to whether Bond/Connery is still up to the job. Happily, Connery more than proves himself ready for Bondage again. Though he is a bit grayer, sporting a bit more girth and wearing a slightly more obvious toupee, he seems to have no trouble slipping back into action. All in all, it is one of Connery's best, and most relaxed, turns as the character. 9 points.Bond Babes: Even in the best of the Bond films, the female characters aren't given much dimension; they exist largely as necessary props for Bond's use. Future Oscar-winner Kim Basinger is granted a great deal of leeway in creating her character of Domino Petachi and the film benefits from this. She does a nice job -- and she's not bad to look at either. 8 points.Bond Villain: The reports of his death being obviously exaggerated, Blofeld is back -- at least, for the moment -- showing he has more lives than his prized pussycat. One-time Jesus portrayer-turned-stereotypical villain, Max von Sydow isn't given a lot to do in the role, but is a silky presence nonetheless. But he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximilian Largo. After a string of banal Bond villains, it is so refreshing for Brandauer to gave a performance that is both subtle, yet colorfully evil. Funny without being campy, ruthless without seeming cartoonish; his Largo ranks right up there with Auric Goldfinger as one of Bond's best villains. 10 points.Bond Baddies: Fatima Blush! What can I say? As played with all the bold style of a particularly flamboyant drag queen, Barbara Carrera breezes through the film, displaying a mix of self-amused evil and more than a tad of pure psychotic insanity. Bond has crossed paths with a variety of femmes fatales, most of whom have been so easily disposed of that they existed more as amusing eye candy than as characters. But few dared to exhibit such a flare for the dramatic or such fierce determination. Even her untimely demise is spectacular, even by Bondian standards. 10 points.Sinister Plot: As a remake of sorts of THUNDERBALL, the film does seem a bit been-there-done-that: nuclear missiles are stolen and major real estate will go kaboom if all the countries of the world don't pay a multi-kazillion dollar ransom. But at least producer Kevin McClory was lucky enough to find himself forced to remake one of the weakest Bond adventures. By comparisons, this effort blows THUNDERBALL out of the water. And despite the absence of many Bondian trademarks, the film succeeds on its own. 9 points.Production values: The film starts out with an uneasy style, like a TV movie trying to be more than it can. But as the story progress, the film gains momentum and a sense of purpose, making it a superior adventure. 8 points. Bonus Points: There are several odd changes that sets this Bond film apart from the official series. Miss Moneypenny is hardly acknowledged; as played by Edward Fox, ""M"" is a cranky old grouch with no respect for the ""Double Os,"" a foreshadowing of how Judi Dench would later play the part; and ""Q"" suddenly has a cockney accent and is all buddy-buddy with Bond. And there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film, such as replacing Bond's Astin-Martin with a vintage Packard and a tango dance number that is cleverly inserted into the story. And a big rescue near the end is on horseback, an homage to THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, which was itself a tribute to the Bond films. 5 points.Summary: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a mixed bag. In the really important areas, it more than holds it own thanks to hero Connery, villain Brandauer, assassin Carrera and damsel-in-distress Basinger. But the devil is in the details; as seemingly unimportant as the opening credits, theme song and such seem, the film is lacking because of their absence. It all comes off as a faux Bond film; a very good substitute, but a substitute nonetheless.Bond-o-meter Rating: 78 points out of 100.",Never Say Never Again
94,michaelarmer,Never Do It Again Ever,7,30 March 2020,"This is not from the same team that made the usual series of Bond movies, it was produced in opposition to those, up against Octopussy in the same year, and I think it is better than that.Sean Connery returns as Bond, and despite looking a bit older and his toupee looking more obvious, he still does a good job, he is more serious, with no daft quips, and exudes an air of confidence. Klaus Maria Brandauer does a good psycho megalomaniac and Barbara Carrera does a good psychotic henchwoman, the usual roles in the usual films have all got different actors, and vary in quality of acting, Max von Sydow plays the head of SPECTRE. The best actor is Alec McCowan playing Algernon (the 'Q' in this) he does a great cameo.
Bond Themes:- yes they copy the official films in lots of ways, in this they have the Casino scene, a Festival, Felix Leiter, and a Live intro, but no Silhouette titles, and a few other items missing.
The Henchman (only 1) is played by Pat Roach (English) and he does look the part.Bond Girls:- Bond has 4 in this, firstly Miss Fearing (no. 41) played by Prunella Gee (England), then he has the baddie girl no. 42 - Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera - Nicaragua) before killing her, then a woman he meets on a boat in the Bahamas (no. 43), played by Valerie Leon (England) who was an hotel receptionist in 'The Spy Who Loved Me', and lastly (no. 44) Domino (Kim Basinger - USA) who is the sexiest and most beautiful, note that both Prunella Gee and Valerie Leon were a bit older than usual Bond Girls, I think this is because Bond himself was looking it as well. Fatima was both Henchwoman and Bond Girl.The quality of the film was ok, no daft stuff like in the recent ""official"" Bond movies, well maybe Rowan Atkinson was a bit daft. Some of the locations were authentic some not (like in Octopussy), music was terrible, the title song was poor, photography average, and there were a few mistakes and missed parts of scenes, but generally the action and acting were good to get over other problems. So I give it a 7.",Never Say Never Again

96,TheHonestCritic,"There's a reason why this ""Bond film"" is not canonical to the official series. Because it sucks!",4,29 October 2020,"""Never Say Never Again"" (1983), why was this ""movie"" made? No, seriously..... Why?! All right, let's just get this review over with..... This ""film"" contributes nothing to the world of James Bond media. It's definitely, in my opinion, one of the worst Bond parodies I have ever seen in my life. This ""movie"" has a boring ripoff of a story, average to mediocre acting and an incoherent soundtrack. This ""film"" is a remake of ""Thunderball"" (1965). For those who may not know, that's not a particular favorite of mine in the Bond series. But, I'll tell you one thing, that movie is Oscar-worthy compared to ""Never Say Never Again"", and ""Thunderball"" sucks. That's pretty bad! Right? I guess I can sort of understand where the writers and producers were coming from, wanting to improve ""Thunderball"". But unfortunately, ""Never Say Never Again"" makes the same mistakes. Except the mistakes here are ten times worse! Probably the most boring part of this ""movie"" and ""Thunderball"" are the underwater scenes. Granted, the underwater scenes are well filmed and edited for each subsequent film. However, some moron on drugs said: ""hey, for 'Never Say Never Again', we'll have the climax take place underwater! The audience will have no choice but to accept it!"" Yeah, I have no clue what kind of drugs the film makers were on either. But, I will tell you this, I do not accept it. Let alone, the existence of this ""movie""! Underwater scenes have to be handled very carefully, or they turn out to be boring. To call these underwater scenes boring is quite an understatement! There is one cool scene in this ""film"" though, where Bond and the main villain are playing a video game called Domination. In the game, whoever loses each level gets an electric shock. The higher the stakes, the more powerful the shocks are. Wow, that's a very sorry state for an iconic character if I ever saw one. When watching two people playing a video game is the most entertaining part of your film, then something is definitely wrong. As for the acting, it's just as much of a letdown as you can imagine. Even Sean Connery was kind of bland! His performance was just recycled from his far more entertaining original Bond films. Talk about formulaic, right? In fact, he was the only reason I watched this ""movie"" in the first place! It breaks my heart to see my favorite Bond actor reduced to this state. Which really begs the question, how in the world did they convince him to take part in this trash heap? The only decent performances come from Klaus Maria Brandauer as the main villain, Rowan Atkinson as Nigel, Bernie Casey as Felix and Edward Fox as M. They seemed to be the only ones who cared about putting some sort of effort in their performances. The rest of the actors and actresses just suck in this ""film""! What happened? All of the actors and actresses subjected to this ""movie"" have acted well in other movies and shows! What's their excuse here? Finally, the soundtrack composed by Michel Legrand is a jumbled incoherent mess. Now, there are some parts of the film score where it almost got on the right track, but ultimately kept falling flat. The only interesting part of the soundtrack is the main theme song. But, the ironic thing is, it's the most out-of-place song for this ""film"". How ironic! The biggest highlight of the film score is the worst song of all! It could have maybe worked for some other movies or TV shows. But here, it completely takes away from the storyline. What little there is! Now, let's get to the positive elements in this steaming piece of garbage. Yes, surprisingly, this ""movie"" has some redeeming qualities to it after all. All of the sets/locations and the special effects are great. My personal favorites are the places in the Bahamas. Those places, along with the others, really help to give the ""film"" a beautiful atmosphere. The only other positive is the special effects. All of the special effects are well-done and still hold up to this day. ""Never Say Never Again"" is a horrible excuse of a diarrhea stain in the world of James Bond. It really leaves a terrible taste in your mouth! All I have to say is: sorry, Sean Connery. Sorry you had to be subjected to such a crappy movie. (It's no wonder he wanted to retire from being a secret agent at the end!) Still, it's better than Daniel Craig's Bond films. Take that, Daniel Craig! I'm struggling to rate this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Let this serve as a warning, if you ask me to watch this ""movie"" with you, I will say: ""never again!""",Never Say Never Again
97,januszlvii,The Best Of The Bonds,10,25 April 2021,"I am of the opinion that there are four 10/10 star Bond films. In chronological order they are. 1: From Russia With Love. 2: Goldfinger. 3: Never Say Never Again ( NSNA). 4: The Living Daylights. What makes this film my favorite is it has everything. Sean Connery as James Bond, you have one of the top three Bond girls in Kim Basinger ( Domino). I admit to being a Basinger fan ( I have seen over 20 of her films) so that does influence me, and an excellent villain. For me, what makes a good action film ( Bond or not) , is the menace that the hero must overcome and Klaus Maria Brandaur's Largo like Goldfinger ( Gert Frobe), Jaws ( Richard Kiel) .and Scsramanga ( Christopher Lee) from The Man With The Golden Gun is the kind of villain that put Bond in real peril. I also think of all of the Bond's Sean Connery is the one you think of as an action hero. Look at other non Bond films he did like The Rock and you see what I mean. Daniel Craig? Very good but not really a tough guy. Pierce Brosnan and Roger Moore? Not even close. Octopussy with Moore in clown make up might be the most cringe worthy scene in Bond history. Only Timothy Dalton in the Living Daylights succeeds as being a tough guy ( and so does Maryam d,abo ( Kara) as the Bond Girl). But the villains are not that great. I would also note the training scenes of an older Bond having to get back into shape. All of this adds up to the best of the Bond's and an easy 10/10 stars.",Never Say Never Again
98,bluesman-20,welcome back 007 we missed you.,10,5 July 2010,"Never say Never Again is just a remake of Thunderball but updated to the 80's. Sean Connery is back in action as James Bond sure Bond is a little older and his skills have slipped a little,Too many women and too many martinis and a poor choice of lifestyle have slowed him up. But when the chips are down and the world needs him James Bond comes thru perfectly every time. Never Say Never Again is not a perfect film there are flaws but you take the good with the bad and you enjoy it. Max Von Sydow is Blofeld he makes the villain menacing you can believe that blofeld is as evil and merciless as they come.

99,mnpollio,A welcome final return by Connery,8,29 March 2007,"Sean Connery returns to the role he created playing an older Bond in this thinly veiled remake of Thunderball. Interestingly, Bond purists have a tendency to vilify and dismiss this film, but it was highly regarded at the time of release by critics.Bond: Connery is back with a slightly different spin on the role, playing Bond as older, wiser, but no less effective in the spy trade. Amusingly, even though Connery is playing older, he seems more vibrant and virile in the role than does Roger Moore, looking pallid and weak in the same year's slapsticky Octopussy. Connery's deadpan humor is also a welcome alternative from Moore's broad comedy, which often bordered Benny Hill double entendre territory.The villains: Klaus Maria Brandauer is one of the classiest and most believable villains from the Bond films. He crafts a debonair, dangerous and intriguingly flawed individual. Unlike many of his predecessors (including Adolfo Celi from the original), he honestly seems to be in love with the heroine of the piece and gets ticked off by being rejected in favor of Bond.The women: Kim Basinger is lovely, but she honestly appears to have limited acting ability in this film. She is a bit of a wimp. By contrast, Barbara Carrera is worth the price of admission as the sexy and deadly femme fatale, Fatima Blush. Carrera had the role of her career here and she expertly knows when to play it tongue-in-cheek and when to play it straight. She earned a well-deserved Golden Globe nomination for her turn.While this is an intriguing anomaly - a Bond film that falls outside the Broccoli pantheon, the film does share some of the weaknesses of the original Thunderball. The running time is too long and there is some over-abundance on underwater action sequences. Still, Irvin Kershner's fluid direction is a bonus and the film has a distinctive sense of humor that never falls into the cartoony realm of the concurrently running Moore film.",Never Say Never Again

The direction is adequate, the casting excellent, where Klaus Maria Brandauer stands out, a wonderful actor, Max Von Sydow hardly appears but stands out, the ladies are remarkable and beautiful, what more can be said. Although the film is long, the good humor and the notion of saying goodbye to the best Bond of all time makes up for the problem. Of the best of this endless saga.",Never Say Never Again
101,Apollo15AnnoPianoCatDogSnailAnt,Entertaining Bond wheeling out again,6,28 November 2019,"The humor in here works. There are things like urine being thrown in a jar and another instance of Bond asking if he should pee from across the room for the health sample while resting in bed. The conviction of the first Bond movies is something I think is of the most quality, and entertaining because of that. I am easy about humor and it is said it is the toughest genre. The accomplishment of having humor burg balanced with the other element of action/adventure and also being sorta funny. The movie actually utilizes humor and is careful not to make it trite or dull, it is amusing since they have to add something else and not just another Thunderball which this being the same tale, that movie having all of that pomp and lavishness that this NEer Say Never Again shows the prowess of humor as its quality. This is from me who appreciates the balance of humor and seriousness of the first 6 Bond movies which have the conviction, more serious, and they could have just cont. this in the 70s/80s with the bell bottoms, sideburns grown out hair like the Bruce Lee movies. Here the series trajectory is lighter. Checking this from this diff. perspective someone can find enjoyment in the comedic and this movie really has this fine-tuned. There's great locales and how this just goes from the Caribbean (like in Thunderball) to primarily the Mediterranean is a great uniqueness. The badguy and badgal are A+. Connery plays this with aplomb of course. There is just lots to compare this with Thunderball and just as I say while the former has lavish extravagance( lots of people, more action set pieces) this relic on humor but done well, not going into farce territory, not undermining its own conviction. Instead of playing cards they play video games with the badguy and this actually works. The finale is once more a giant weapon battle which is yawn but yet is mesmerizing in the chaos yet again.",Never Say Never Again
102,aramis-112-804880,When is a Bond Movie Not a Bond Movie?,5,7 June 2017,"For those who argue Sean Connery was the only ""Bond""--well, Moore was considered when Sean got the job (Moore was busy and never actually tested, but if he'd got the job and been Bond for 25 years no one would ever have known the difference). This proves Connery isn't Bond, though Connery is enough.Connery does have a powerful screen presence, but in this movie he comes off as an old spy hassled by his younger superiors yet still able to attract strong young women.The fact is, this movie was made because Ian Fleming, Bond creator, did Kevin McClory. Fleming worked with McClory on an earlier Bond treatment that went nowhere. He then took his ideas (and McClory's) and wrote THUNDERBALL, the rights of which he sold to Broccoli and Saltzman.From that point on, McClory dogged the producers of the James Bond movies we all know and love (or hate) with lawsuits anytime he thought he saw an inkling of his work reflected in the movies. McClory won his lawsuit to make his own version of THUNDERBALL and this is it. It's basically a reboot of THUNDERBALL.Unfortunately, it doesn't have the feel of ""James Bond."" It doesn't have the support staff (Bernard Lee was dead by this time but his replacement, Edward Fox, is a fussy little man concerned about Bond's diet of white bread; Pamela Salem is wasted as a stupid, if funny, Moneypenny; and while their Q, like Fox, is an otherwise good actor, he's not really Q, is he?) We've come to expect a lot of things from Bond: exotic locations, with hot and cold running women; ridiculously enormous, but wonderful, Ken Adam or Peter Lamont sets; John Barry music; villains who are either over the top or snidely self-righteous in a Clinton/Gore sort of way. Gadgets.Well, we have the locales. We have SPECTRE and its villains, the cold Blofeld (Max von Sydow, complete with cat) and the almost painfully over-the-top Largo (Klaus Maria Brandauer). Georgia peach Kim Basinger woefully out of her league as Domino, but dark and fiery Barbara Carrera picking up any decline in sexual heat.We also have Rowan Atkinson as idiotic comic relief (as if we needed more), after Fox and Salem.What we don't have is good music, and especially the ""James Bond Theme""--a tune that never grows old and always breaks out, either that or Barry's ""007"", every time something Bond-like happens. What we don't have is Cubby Broccoli's money thrown into design so even in the days when his Bonds ceased being the only game in town and slid in with the other action movies, they were still a peg up from the others in look.This is what James Bond movies might have been without Broccoli and Saltzman. Slapdash, with new faces thrown in willy-nilly on second-hand ideas. Oh, they updated their technology--to 1983 standards. So what? Outside of Bond, Sean Connery made some good movies (""Murder on the Orient Express"" or ""The Man Who Would be King"") and he's made an ass of himself (Remember ""Zardoz""? Or the wifebeating comedy ""A Fine Madness""? If you don't remember them, thank your lucky stars) He holds up well (only six years later he was Indiana Jones' father). But we've been conditioned to think of ""James Bond"" as Broccoli rather than Fleming (in fact, instead of Fleming). This is neither. It's just another Connery movie, not as run of the mill as some, not as good as others; certainly better than Peter Sellers' ""Casino Royale."" It has the feel of one of the better Bond imitators the 1960s were full of. And we can be grateful it was Broccoli, not Kevin McClory, who got his hooks on the rest of Bond.On a curious note, ""Never Say Never Again"" was released the same years as ""Octopussy""--not one of Moore's best outings. I'm old enough to remember the ""competing Bonds"" news reports. Well, there was no competition. Octopussy was number 6 at the box office. But both Bonds were blown away--by ""Return of the Jedi.""",Never Say Never Again
103,antagonist117,Proof that good casting does not a good Bond movie make,4,28 September 2014,"In the twelve years he was away from 007, Sean Connery lost little of his appeal. Even deep into Roger Moore's respectable run as the glamorized spy, it is tempting to argue that Connery's ""Never Say Never Again,"" not Moore's ""Octopussy,"" was the Bond movie to see in 1983. After all, it features not only the quintessential Bond in Connery, but also legitimate movie stars in Kim Basinger and Max von Sydow. And thanks to a decades-long legal dispute it's a remake of ""Thunderball,"" one of the meatier early Bond films, whereas ""Octopussy"" is scraped from a short story collection near the bottom of the barrel of the almost-exhausted Ian Fleming library. But as it turns out, good actors and good source material do not a good 007 movie make, and ""Octopussy,"" not ""Never Say Never Again,"" was the better Bond in 1983. What the former has that the latter lacks is the trademarked trappings that make Bond Bond regardless of actor, regardless of time period, regardless of quality. The gun barrel logo that opens almost every film in the official series; the jangly guitar riff theme; a Maurice Binder credit sequence; Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny and Desmond Llewellyn as Q, two fixtures and fan favorites who have proved hard to replace since their retirements and deaths. ""Never Say Never Again"" has to try to fill these shoes and inevitably falls short. It seems not even to have tried to replace the theme song, and it opts against a title sequence. It has a title song, but this stacks up poorly even against the forgettable and indecency-free song from ""Octopussy."" Even with Connery in the starring role, ""Never Say Never Again"" never feels like a real Bond movie. It feels like what it is: a knock-off. Not a cheap one; its budget actually surpassed ""Octopussy""'s, in part due to Connery's salary and reported production problems, but with less bang for the buck. Its vehicles and gadgets are fewer and less imaginative, its sets smaller. It tries much harder than ""Octopussy"" to be current, with its prominent use of 80s arcade games and 80s aerobics outfits and constant references to the passing of time and the aging of Connery, while ""Octopussy"" trades in nostalgia for colonial India, traveling circuses, and trains. There is perhaps a lesson here for the latter-day, revisionist, relaunched Bond movies: Bond is a throwback hero, and works better in throwback settings than when he is shoehorned into the present. ""Never Say Never Again"" is not as relentlessly stupid as some of the worst official Bond films, but it's not smart or entertaining enough to be a good standalone action movie in its own right. It has to be judged as a Bond movie, and Bond movies have to be judged by their own peculiar standards. ""Octopussy"" checks the Bond movie boxes, and ""Never Say Never Again,"" being legally barred from so many of those boxes, is neither a convincing facsimile nor an attempt to forge new benchmarks.",Never Say Never Again
104,mattiasflgrtll6,This is a very weird Bond-movie...,4,29 April 2013,"This Bond-movie is just so strange. Bond cuts down on drinking martinis, which is a very stupid theme, since it's a trademark of the earlier films. Also, both Bond and whole film overall feels very toned down, there just IS something missing. I can't really comment on the Bond-girl, since they are so easily forgettable, and about the only ones I can remember is the one at the island in the first film and Bond's girlfriend in the second one. Sure, he's a womanizer, but can they at least make the women more interesting? Normally I love Sean Connery as Bond, but if they can't make Bond interesting in this one, Connery's performance doesn't help. Without doubt the worst in the series. A highlight in the movie, however, is Rowan Atkinson in one of his earliest roles. I just wish he could have been featured more in this one, because the movie is dull and although the endings on Bond-movies are rarely interesting, this one was the dumbest I've ever seen.

Tossing away everything that made Bond successful in the first place, this movie further degrades the Bond character throwing him into the category of Inspector Gadget. Get Smart this ain't. There is no style here, only second rate actors performing on cheap sets. It's a shame that Connery couldn't lend an element of class here but it doesn't come across. Everything here reeks of mediocrity, including Connery's bad toupee.

106,David_Frames,Make Mr.Connery's Cheque payable to CASH,5,5 May 2005,"A Francaise oddity this: A rival Bond movie produced by another studio starring the actor that made the original series successful in the first place. Its nothing new though, a remake of Thunderball as this was the script Warners somehow secured the rights to reproduce, directed by none other than the helmsman of the Empire Strikes Back! Its sounds a lot like a joke doesn't it? But Never Say Never Again is very real, its just not very good. The edge it has over its Eon rival of the time, Roger Moore's entry Octopussy, is that its larger budget gives it a gloss that makes the series proper look a little threadbare. Also Kersher inevitably has to be an asset, even if his direction is for the most part fairly ordinary. When he can be bothered there's a little energy to the proceedings. The real coup though is of course the casting of Sean Connery as Bond. Why the then ageing star felt compelled to remake his own film is a mystery though I suspect vanity in the opportunity to directly compete against and upstage Moore and an obscene amount of cash may have chystillised matters for him. He's undoubtedly the best thing in it by a landslide - a little more jowly and generous around the midriff certainly but still able to land a punch and deliver the one liners with effortless panache. What you miss though is the usual supporting cast, not present for obvious reasons, who might have made it a fully rounded nostalgic experience. Gone to is the trademark support from John Barry replaced by some now dated musak and a pretty dreadful theme song. The advantage of having Barry on board would be that at the very least you could rely on him to provide a ear pleasing composition to graft some saccharine lyrics on to, see Octopussy's All Time High, here its a hurried saxophone and synthesiser conflation that really bleeds the drums. This would all be merely cosmetic though if Never Say Never Again was an action packed, thrill a minute ride. In fact the action is sparing and all too brief and it lags like murder in many places which is probably why its usually transmitted on Bank Holidays when most people are half asleep anyway. A bit dull and pointless then but wait a minute, where do I get me one of those Domination computer consoles?",Never Say Never Again
107,vox-sane,Proof That James Bond is Bigger than Sean Connery,5,14 December 1999,"Sean Connery's presence does make this movie any better.  The score is rotten (they couldn't use the Barry music, of course, being a renegade movie, but the music just isn't suitable).  The plot, loosely based on ""Thunderball"", is so close it seems redundant.  One might pretend Largo's boy came back to do the same thing his father did.  But if any further proof is needed that James Bond is bigger than Sean Connery, it's that four good actors -- Connery, Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan -- have essayed the role, in movies that vary in quality, but that Sean Connery alone cannot lift this movie above its derivative plot.  Barbara Carrera makes a great Bond villain.  Nevertheless, this movie is more a curious bit of Bond apocrypha that suffers when seen in conjunction with movies in the orthodox Bond franchise.",Never Say Never Again
108,keelhaul-80856,Thunderball with an old man Connery.,5,8 November 2017,"This one is entertaining, but basically a rip-off of Thunderball. Apparently, the studios were fighting over rights to the name and music, etc. and this one isn't even considered Bond canon. The Good= Connery is always fun to watch, and his reprisal of the role was enough to make it salvageable. There is a fair amount of action and some 80s cheese that is kind of funny, as we rehash the earlier films of the 60s through this one. The brunette villain is interesting and sexy. I think I also saw a young ""Mr. Bean"" or ""Johnny English"" in this one for humor.The Bad= They couldn't even open with the trademark Bond music, and all the original actors are missing from the usual films. They have all been replaced by mediocre bozos, so it leaves you feeling like you are watching a high school version of some scenes. The Ugly= Connery is my favorite as the original bond, and he stars in a lot of decent films. However, casting him yet again, by the 80s, as the same hunky 007 ladies man tough guy was stretching it, to say the least. Luckily, his persona and rugged charm can sort of save this, but you still have to laugh in many scenes, where his age and weight and toupee are just funny. Every woman turns to look at him like a piece of meat, no matter what location he is in, or what clothing. I'm like really? He's that cool that 6 women start drooling when a dumpy guy in his 50s walks in with a sweat shirt on??? LMAO. That was hilarious. The missing signature music and other credentials make this one bland, also, as mentioned, and it is a very lazy 80s reboot of Thunderball. Also, Kim Basinger is cute, but overrated, and this Largo wasn't nearly as interesting as the original. This comes across as worthy of an occasional watch, but nothing to write home about.",Never Say Never Again
109,carologletree,"A Pointless, Lackluster Debacle of a Movie",3,9 January 2016,"Every die-hard Bond fan knows that this movie came to be because Kevin McClory felt he deserved credit for ""Thunderball's"" original screenplay and for the creation of Spectre and Blofeld. The court case was eventually settled with McClory being allowed to make his own Bond film. Since they wouldn't allow him to do an original screenplay, he decided to do a remake of ""Thunderball."" I must say, I was never a huge fan of ""Thunderball,"" but it's vastly superior to this lackluster remake.They were able to get Sean Connery to return to the role of Bond after he had said ""never again"" twice before. That's how the film got its title. It was an obvious attempt to draw in old fans. However, in this movie, it once again shows how Connery had lost interest in playing the character. He pretty much phones in his performance, even more so than in ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" his last official Bond film.Klaus Brandauer is nothing special as Maximilian Largo, and the actors who played Q, M, Moneypenny, and Felix didn't leave too much of an impression on me, either. Max Von Sydow is completely wasted as Blofeld. It was retarded to even use Blofeld at all if he and Bond never came face-to-face in the movie, considering that this is the only movie they were going to make.Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush is one of the weirdest Bond girls ever. I don't want to even mention some of the ridiculous things she did. Kim Basinger is okay as Domino, but nothing too notable.The action scenes are poor and even weird at times. The direction and script are also very disappointing.This movie is a misfire at almost every turn. Maybe ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" weren't so bad, because this movie made them look good. This just doesn't feel like a Bond movie. If it weren't for the return of Connery, this movie probably would be LONG forgotten by now.RATING: D",Never Say Never Again
110,LuboLarsson,Sean returns as 007,6,3 August 2003,"Sean Connery returns as agent 007, James Bond after a 12 year gap. Whilst Roger Moore was making an official Bond film ""Octopussy"", Sean Connery made this film a completely un-official Bond film. Sadly its not that great. For a start it's missing a lot of things that make the viewer feel that they are watching a Bond film, a pre-credits sequence, Maurice Binders titles, the gun barrel intro or John Barry music, plus any decent gadgets or memorable action sequences. My main pet hate about the film is the music, it doesn't belong in a Bond film. One thing the film-makers had going for them was the simple fact that they got Sean to reprise his role as 007 and he's great in this, its everything else that lets it down, couldn't the producers tried a little harder to make it a more like the other 007 flicks? or were they worried about getting sued? Who knows. They also had the rights to use the Blofeld character but done little with it, even though they had a great actor in the role, the under used Max Von Sydow. Kim Basinger makes a pretty good Bond girl, she looks fabulous but wasn't as good an actress then as she is now. Also why did the director of this film make such an amazing film like The Empire Strikes Back with its outstanding set pieces and not deliver any great ones in this. Octopussy was a much better film, but at least it was nice to see Sean back I suppose, he looked more interested here than he did in his last two 007 films. In You Only Live Twice and Diamonds are Forever he looked bored of the role, he doesn't here thankfully as that would kill this film stone dead. Pity he never came back for one more try although check out The Rock for the nearest he's come to playing Bond again.",Never Say Never Again
111,flapdoodle64,Never Say You'll Never Be Middle-Aged,6,14 January 2016,"In a couple months I will turn 52, just about the age that Sean Connery was when he made this film, which I happened to have caught at the movie theater back in 1983 when I was 19 years old. With this in mind, I re-watched NSNA for the first time in almost 33 years over the course of 4 daily workouts on the treadmill machine, finishing up yesterday.Last night, I turned on a rerun of an old Johnny Carson show on the Antenna-TV network, and who turns up but Connery, sans toupee and sporting his classic 'stache. Turns out the show was from 1983, and Sean was promoting NSNA.Believing this to be another instance of synchronicity in my never-ending study of fine arts, I determined to add my review to the body of literature devoted to this cinematic opus.The most interesting thing about this movie is the middle-aged Connery, playing the middle-aged 007. These facts are used to advantage early on in the film but are mostly forgotten by midpoint, with the Scots thespian's handsomely craggy facial features being the only reminder that in addition to the evil Mr. Largo, Our Hero is also fighting the inevitable effects of father time. As such, this is a lost opportunity.(Two years after this film, cartoonist Frank Miller did a much-praised comic book story of a 50 year old Batman titled 'Dark Knight,' which became a genuine cultural phenomenon...Miller never forgot for a moment that the Caped Crusader was now 50, and in fact in the early scenes Bruce Wayne sports a mustache and receding hairline which make him strangely similar to Connery.) The other missed opportunity is the climactic physical confrontation between 007 & Largo, which takes place underwater, with both wearing scuba gear. As you can anticipate, the scuba fight takes place in slow-motion, thus sucking way much of the satisfaction. This was a story which clearly called for a knock-down, drag-out fight, ala Red Grant, the aging 007 going Mano e Mano against the young Teutonic Largo.The musical score is another weak spot. It seemed decent enough in 1983, but the fusion-jazz stuff seems very outdated now, whereas the bombastic John Barry stuff from the EON films has held up much better.Weaknesses aside, this is a fun enough film with which to waste a couple hours. Besides the enduring appeal of our old friend Mr. Connery, there are plenty of fights, vehicular chases, and fun spy-fi business to enjoy. If you are young and viewing this, remember that the when you are over 50, the world will be a different place, and you will be far more vulnerable than now. Your nemesis will not be SPECTRE, but rather the limitations of your body, and the cruelties of the workplace, where cocky young SOB managers like to treat experienced, seasoned pros as if we are all dead wood.",Never Say Never Again
112,michelerealini,Not exceptional... but there's Connery!,7,22 September 2005,"In 1965 producer Kevin McLory -who owns a part of the Bond cinematic rights- associate with EON Productions (Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli) for making ""Thunderball"", the fourth film of the 007 franchise. The star is Sean Connery, of course.In 1982 McLory wins a legal battle and can produce an ""independent"" Bond film. ""Never say never again"" (NSNA) is one of the two ""unofficial"" 007 films made outside EON (the other is the 1967 comedy spoof ""Casino Royale""). NSNA is a remake of ""Thunderball"" and stars the original Bond, Sean Connery -who comes back to the role after many years of absence.The film is released some months after ""Octopussy"" with Roger Moore, the 13th episode of the EON series. At the time press calls it ""War of the Bonds""... Both films are a big success in 1983, even if ""Octopussy"" earns more money at the box office.NSNA is a luxurious film made by excellent technicians -director Irvin Kershner who led ""The Empire strikes back"", Douglas Slocombe -cinematographer of ""Raiders of the lost Ark""-, and screenwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr -who wrote ""The three days of the Condor""- among others...The cast is excellent with Connery, a then relatively unknown Kim Basinger, Barbara Carrera, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max Von Sydow, Edward Fox...Although all that the film remains inferior to the original ""Thunderball"". It lacks many fundamental ingredients for being a real Bond movie: there's not the traditional gun barrel sequence, there's not the ""James Bond theme"", M and Q are not played by the traditional actors... It's a copyright reason: EON only is allowed to use these elements. Briefly, NSNA lacks the classic cinematic 007 atmosphere.On the other hand the film is exciting and enjoyable. Brandauer is a very good villain and the women (Basinger and Carrera) are sensual and gorgeous. But the main highlight is Sean Connery! He's once again wonderful in the role, he's older but looks fitter and nicer here than in ""Diamonds are forever"", his last performance in the role of the British super-spy before NSNA.",Never Say Never Again

Anyway, what we get here is weird to see, with there being no opening credit scene like every other Bond movie and no Bond theme music and different actors for Moneypenny and M and Q. These characters have been ingrained in our memory and now they're all different. Weird. Made by the same guy who did The Empire Strikes Back, the action scenes here just didn't do much for me.

116,wrestlingsitewebmaster,Never Say Never Again 1983,7,19 March 2008,"Fine film but with lousy acting.NSNA had a credible storyline and some good screen footage of all the exotic locations but in this writers opinion the actors from Max Von Sydow and Alec McGowan spoil it with their p-ss poor acting.Truth be told I thought some actors like Sean Connery and the late Pat Roach did a good job in the film and Roach did look like an intimidating Bond baddie. But what this writer can't understand to this day is that they decided to use Rowan Atkinson as an MI6 agent!!! Atkinson's character is so dumb that he actually shouts ""Mr Bond!"" at the top of his voice whilst Bond is undercover. I think the producers were drunk when they picked Atkinson for this film.Klaus Maria Brandauer who played Largo was OK in the film but lacked the toughness to play a member of SPECTRE, granted Largo in the film is a charming, silent killer but he can't be taken too seriously.Max Von Sydow who played Blofeld on the other hand looked awful and in previous films Blofeld who was played by Anthony Dawson (From Russia With Love and Thunderball) Donald Pleseance (You Only Live Twice) and Charles Gray (Diamonds are Forever) were all intimidating and they rarely had people around them but this Blofeld in this film had loads of guests around him and was smiling and looked like he was enjoying life too much (in previous films like Thunderball the actor who played Blofeld did so in such a superb way that Dawson did scare the audience at the time with his deep voice (ok so it was dubbed but you get the point) and viewers never seen his face) Kim Bassinger who played Domino was a perfect choice for the film and this is one of the actors who the production crew got it right with.One scene I enjoyed was when Bond came out of the airport and Felix Leiter who was played exceptionally well by BernieCasey threw an apple at Bond at he caught it at the last minute. One scene that always baffles me is when Bond is tied up and Largo as silly as he his even tells Bond where the atomic bomb is! Bond asks him where it is and Largo replies ""Right under the president's feet in Washington D.C"". I know Bond was tied up but still surely that's top secret?!

120,cordaro9418,"Officially, we have no stance on this project....",7,10 September 2008,"Yes, it stars Sean Connery and an all star duo of Bond girls. Yes, it has Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Yes, it is an unabashed remake of Thunderball. No, it is not an official James Bond: 007 film.Officially, Sean Connery starred in five 007 vehicles (MGM/United Artists releases), his sixth, a heated court battle affair for Warner Bros. Pictures, simply makes up for his 'Diamonds..' farewell. A decade later with better hair and in far better shape, Connery decided to put Bond to bed his way. Originally designed to be a new bond series to go head to head with UA's Roger Moore vehicles, Warner's took Kevin McClory's 'Thunderball' rights and parlayed them into film... but in the end, a one shot deal. Connery's 'Never' smacked his replacement's 'Octopussy' in the face at the box-office (for those who consider Moore the only replacement for Connery: Lazenby did actually count!)for weekend gross, but the two went neck in neck down the stretch. Octopussy however, did serve as Moore's 2nd best outing and a great Bond epic.Although remaking his own Bond film, Connery does himself justice slipping back into the wetsuit, showing the skill and quality that made him the Double-Oh, putting 'Diamonds' further in the rear view and out of mind. Over all, the film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola through his brother in-law Mr. Talia Shire Kircshner, and dumbed it down a tad.Alone, this film makes a great popcorn movie.

Sean Connery came back for this one and gave a good performance but looks a little old for the part now. The villain and Bond girls were ok. This movie was kind of a remake of Thunderball which was not necessary. The action scenes are fun but overall it was a fairly average film. Would say it is worth watching if you're a Bond fan.6.5/10,Never Say Never Again
122,TimBoHannon,Never Remake Thunderball Again,4,19 July 2013,"I freely admit that ""Never Say Never Again"" may be the toughest movie for me to review unbiased. It is a James Bond movie, but it exists outside canon. Every other has distinct markings that tell a viewer's mind ""You are watching a Bond movie!"" Once somebody has seen them, it is no longer possible to view this picture without your brain telling you that you are watching counterfeit.One of the most common complaints is the missing John Barry musical score. That is certainly legitimate. At the time only four other composers had scored a Bond movie, and only Bill Conti wrote a score that sounds remotely Bond-like. I was not alive in 1983, and my first Bond movie was ""GoldenEye,"" so the absent music should not affect me as much as it did the audience of the time. It would not, except Michael Legrand's score made my ears file a lawsuit against me. This music is *dreadful.*I wrote that Bill Conti's ""For Your Eyes Only"" score clashed with the action, although I also complimented it. Legrand's music is bad enough to ruin the action. He also wrote the eponymously titled theme song that obnoxiously plays over the opening action. My suggestion is to mute the television and play ""The Final Countdown"" or some other bombastic song during this section.Returning Bond actor Sean Connery brings the movie immediate credibility. It is the other shared characters where ""Never Say Never Again"" trips up. Moneypenny (Pamela Salem) is all right. Q (Alec McCowan) is, well, different. I still like him. M (Edward Fox) is a disaster. This M is an unpleasant clever dick always ready with a new complaint. Fox actually does a near-flawless job playing the horribly- scripted, misbegotten excuse for Bond's boss.Being partially a remake of ""Thunderball,"" ""Never Say Never Again"" shares the same plot. SPECTRE, the criminal group above all others, steals two atomic weapons, and then contacts NATO with the conditions they must meet to prevent the ultimate nightmare from ending badly. This movie goes about the theft more believably than the original. Nobody has ever come remotely close to accomplishing a fraction of what is needed to steal nuclear weapons, so the story will be almost as implausible as ""Moonraker"" regardless of how it is told.""Never Say Never Again"" most improves upon its predecessor with the supporting characters. The lead villain is Max Largo, played by Austrian actor Klaus Maria Brandauer. Unlike Thunderball's Emilio, Max is clearly in charge. When this Largo speaks with the villainess, there is mutual respect and he gives the orders. His girlfriend is Domino, this time Petachi (Kim Basinger). While Domino Derval was nearly Emilio's prisoner, Petachi loves Max and is happy with her life. When Bond first sees her, she is dancing by herself on the deck of his yacht.Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera) takes the place of Fiona Volpe. Volpe was a good yet unspectacular villain. Blush takes the character and ratchets up the setting several levels. In a nice role reversal Blush is the one who seduces Bond, simply because she wants to. Her over-the-top clothing adds more fun to the movie and nicely harmonizes with Carrera's alluring, feral performance. As for beauty, Carrera trails only Jane Seymour as the most gorgeous actress to play a Bond girl.The health clinic section is an improvement over ""Thunderball"" since Bond is not sexually harassing the staff, and it has the movie's best action. Actor Pat Roach, famous for airplane propeller fight in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" shows up as a SPECTRE hit-man after Bond. Connery and Roach give us a long, fun, and creative altercation, but its ends awkwardly. Roach's baddie gets a cupful of 007 urine to the face that affects him so badly that he backs into a shelf of glass jars with enough force to kill himself. Bond is so manly even his urine will burn your skin.Like before, Bond needs information from Domino and uses Largo's murder of her brother to change her loyalty. While Fatima keeps the movie from growing boring, it moves so slowly that Bond does not meet Domino until the halfway mark. The turning point happens during Largo's ballroom party, which includes Legrand's one good contribution, ironically presented as in-movie music and not part of the soundtrack. Most of the best scenes come here, and Bond's brilliant and hilarious handling of the doorman is the highlight of movie. However, it follows up with a mostly lifeless chase and then snails towards a finale that, while tepid, avoids the endless underwater battle and tacky speed up effects from ""Thunderball.""SPECTRE founder Ernst Stavro Blofeld returns, played by cinema legend Max von Sydow. This Blofeld is as good as any, but is woefully underused. After Largo's defeat, the movie forgets about him entirely. It would have been great if the movie left enough time for a second climax, but I would have been happy with any type of resolution, even a passing statement of some kind. The complete lack of resolution with Blofeld made the ending feel a little empty for me.Looking past the missing music, gunbarrel opening, title arrangement, familiar sets, and familiar actors is not easy for anybody who has seen a canon Bond movie. ""Never Say Never Again"" is objectively superior to ""Thunderball,"" but comes up short on entertainment. Compared to ""Octopussy,"" the official Bond movie released the same year, ""Never Say Never Again"" is bland, even though it is technically better. Armed with a more focused screenplay, a more balanced story, more good action, and a soundtrack that enhances the movie, this could have been great. Instead, it falls short and Thunderball now rests in pieces.",Never Say Never Again
123,Magenta_Bob,"A bit uncalled for, but all right",5,22 February 2012,"""In fact, I did lose 4 lbs and God knows how many free radicals.""It is hard to find the artistic motivation for this Thunderball rehash of sorts, which, as far as I can remember, is inferior in almost every way. Not that Never Say Never Again strikes me as that much more of a rehash than some other Bond films, since there are many of them that deal with the themes of nuclear weapons, world domination and sex and violence.52-year old Sean Connery is still in good form, but he has less sex appeal, he undeniably looks older, he is less cool and more tongue-in-cheek (e.g. – ""I made you all wet"" – ""Yes, but my martini is still dry""); in short, he's more like Roger Moore. As for the recurring supporting roles (or new versions thereof), M, Q and Moneypenny are not as good as they usually are, but that might be due to habit more than anything. However, Rowan Atkinson's clumsy agent is a nice addition to the team.Overall, the bad guys are better; the feminist Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera) is definitely a precursor to the GoldenEye psycho Xenia Onatopp, Maximillian Largo (Klaus Maria Brandauer) is enjoyably neurotic, and there's a classic giant of a henchman who barely notices when Bond throws a dumbbell in his chest. The only crook who fails to deliver is the Russian speaking Max von Sydow who is surprisingly unthreatening.Unfortunately, Irvin Keshner doesn't really bring anything interesting to the film in terms of direction. He did get to recycle some laser beams from The Empire Strikes back during the climax, though. If anything, with its unusually obvious innuendos, the faux looking settings and the sleazy soundtrack, the film feels more like a 70s porno than an 80s Bond film at times.

The set staging consisted of just buildings with expensive furniture rather than anything atmospheric. The plot is basically a rip off of Thunderball.

127,Rooster99,Much better than most Roger Moore Bond films,8,17 February 2007,"Very solid Bond outing, it is unfortunate that some Bond purists revile this entertaining film merely because of the legal hurdles it was forced to jump through in order to get made. Essentially, it is a remake of Thunderball, as the result of the lawsuits stipulated that was the only rights Kevin McClory had to the character. He did change the story significantly enough that you can discern the similarities, but in no way is it like watching Thunderball again.This Bond is very entertaining. The Bond girls are excellent, the action is non-stop, and best of all, the puns are few, witty, and add to the overall experience as opposed to horribly mangling it as in most of the later Moore films. Whereas the Danjaq production company had Roger Moore portray Bond in a much more Ernest-like manner in the horridly flawed Moonraker, View to a Kill, and other post Live and Let Die films, Never Say Never Again sticks to a much more rugged portrayal of the secret agent. He is tough, ruthless, and unstoppable.Starting with Spy Who Loved Me, and ending terribly with View to a Kill, Moore's Bond got increasingly effeminate, 3 Stoogish, and ridiculous with each movie. Although Spy remains a pretty solid effort, you can start to see how the producers had decided to stray more into the Home Alone type violence with cars ending up in trees, hit men biting through cable car cables, and action scenes more commonly found in Ernest movies than in Bonds. Puns started to overshadow the action, groaners revealing not the slightest shred of wit (culminating in the wince-inducing Die Another Day). Never Say Never Again fortunately returns to Bond's roots, providing great action sequences without the Bond-as-a-Dandy approach. The result is vastly more entertaining than the shockingly bad Moonraker, or any other 80's Bond picture.",Never Say Never Again
128,jonsid57,Reasonable Remake,6,23 October 2021,"A reasonable remake of Thunderball . The film has a few good action scenes including a good fight in a health club, a motorcycle chase and a shark scene . Sean Connery is still great as Bond in his final outing . Barbara Carrera is excellent as the femme fatale Fatima Blush. Kim Bassinger is ok as Domino while Rohan Atkinson has a little role in the film . Like most Bond films the film is a little long at over two hours .",Never Say Never Again
129,The Spectacular Spider-Man,The unofficial Bond flicks are SOOOO bad,7,1 August 2001,"I just can't believe this film. It's incredibly, deliberately slow, more intrested in dull light comedy than thrills and adventure. The entire Bond mythos is given a bizarre working class make-over. The weak action scenes are staged like they would be in the 60's, especially the loooong fight scene in the health club. Sean Connery doesn't really play the 007 he made legendary, he plays a grey-haired parody of himself. This entire film is a comedy, more like Casino Royale than any other Bond flick, and more like a TV movie than any other big budget film I've ever seen. Bond films are supposed to be thrilling, spectacular epics. Never Say never Again is a boring, slow, and above all, LOW-KEY. Why on Earth would you make a Bond movie low-key? Unbelievable.  
But the shark scenes are somewhat impressive.",Never Say Never Again
130,merrywater,Underrated,9,8 September 2015,"This is actually, all-in-all, one of the better Bond productions. As the original ""Thunderball"" picture wasn't, perhaps, the best in the 60s' row of Bond movies, this remake is certainly worth viewing.Yes, does appear aged, but he was the best James Bond in my opinion. ""Never Say Never Again"" has good action, a bit dated plot, but not a dull moment.I don't care much for the music (Is there any particular score here at all?), the 90s fashion, and definitely not the cars. There's, however, a grand car and MC chase that's worth remembering. Maybe the peculiar Ford Mustang speeding scene in ""Thunderball"" where Bond is picked up by Luciana Paluzzi's ""Fiona"" was more original. (""Some men doesn't want to be taken for a ride."")The setting is not the Caribbean Islands but France which is enjoyable enough, in my opinion.The movie is especially to be considered underrated due to its killer cast: Klaus Maria Brandauer, Kim Basinger, Rowan Atkinson, Max von Sydow...A nice finishing touch for Connery's contribution to the Bond series.",Never Say Never Again
131,jubilee77,What can I say?,6,5 September 2020,"""Connery is back"" was the advertising posters for this James Bond film. Being released the same year as Octopussy starring Roger Moore, this one titled Never Say Never Again was clearly made outside Pinewood Studios and was never an official 007 film but a remake of Thunderball. Connery delivers a usually convincing performance as Bond but was looking older at 53, the film isn't always good. It's almost all-cast with lots of womanizing in evidence that makes him extremely seedy and neither does he raise much suspicion.
The reason why Connery made this one was to stick the guns on Albert R Broccoli. As a result, Connery felt that Broccoli diid a very poor job with Diamonds Are Forever and why Broccoli choosed to leave out some of the important editing work is beyond. There are some plus points about Never Say Never Again particularly the Pat Roach scene and the topical seaside settings but on the other hand it's alrightish.",Never Say Never Again
132,scott-1657,Never Say Never Again and Again,8,24 October 2021,"Is this a great Bond film? No. Is this even a *good* Bond film? Not really. Is it a little boring. Yes. Is it very similar to ""Thunderball"" (which was not one of my favorite Conner-Bond flicks)? Definitely. Do I really enjoy this movie? Yes.I almost look at this film as a parody... almost like a progenitor for the Austin Powers movies. Obviously, it was not meant to be that.Connery returns to his role after more than a decade older (badly toupeed) and very sardonic. I really love the scenes at Shrublands, which gives our hero a chance to rattle off some witticisms and show what he's best at. The action scenes definitely show the strains of his absence and age but, like the title, I feel that this film is a wink to the audience almost all the way through.What's MISSING is the trademarked Bond opening title sequence and most especially the incidental music. The soundtrack is pretty tepid to this, and it made me realize how much the 007 theme/traditional James Bond music adds to the films.I did think the supporting cast was excellent. Kim Basinger did what she does best: look ravishing and screams a lot. She's one of the best screamers of 20th-century films. M, Q, and Moneypenny perform their roles dutifully and also with droll humor, especially about eliminating ""free radicals,"" and ""gratuitous sex and violence."" But Klaus Maria Brandauer is, to me, an outstanding and understated Bond villain. He's not dark and evil like the best of them, but he is sly and self-aware, and that self-awareness sets him apart. There is an exchange (I'm paraphrasing) where Domino says to Largo: ""You're crazy,"" and his reflective, affirming, ""maybe"" is splendid.Barbara Carrera is outstanding as Fatima Blush... she can hold a candle to any A-list Bond villainess, and Bernie Casey is as good a Felix Liter as most--he seems out of ""Bond prime.""You can read other reviews for the backstory of why this movie was made... basically a legal dispute between writer Kevin McClory and the official Bond producers over the ""Thunderball"" script/story.I guess I originally saw this for Sean Connery but most appreciate the humor that runs through it, whether intentional or inadvertent! I have seen it a number of times by now and always chuckle.",Never Say Never Again
133,Zorin-2,My least favorite Bond film.,5,11 April 2001,"I am a Bond fan and I own all of the films. My personal least favorite is Never Say Never Again. It's my least favorite because Connery looks too old to play the secret agent (so did Roger Moore at this time) and Kim Basinger is surprisingly bland as the Bond girl. The story is just a mish-mash remake of the original Thunderball and trudges along to a faltered climax. Another downfall to this sequel is that is not part of the ""official"" Bond series, and from the beginning of the film, it loses it's touch. Bond fans should check out, because many moments are still enjoyable. **1/2 out of *****",Never Say Never Again
134,filmbuff69007,Octopussy was so much better,6,26 August 2001,This was based on my least favourite bond film thunderball.that relied on underwater sequences where you couldnt tell one from the other.boring as well.this is better than that i liked fatima bush in this.basinger sucked.the main villan was poor and they cut out a scene where bond gets blofeld.pity.very slow moving very little action and very cheap.in fact it looks cheaper than return of the man from uncle.Connery apparently had a tough time making this film.he was being told how to play the role.now that has to be pretty dumb.if he dont know nobody does.the third worst bond movie only thunderball and casino royale are worse.,Never Say Never Again
135,neobateman,The unofficial James Bond film still offers a fun time,6,20 November 2016,"1983 was an interesting year for Bond fans. We had the 13th official James Bond film Octopussy starring Roger Moore and an unofficial James Bond film by the name of Never Say Never Again starring Sean Connery. This is a remake of the 1965 Bond thriller Tunderball. I think if you are a fan of Sean Connery as James Bond then you'll like this movie. Barbara Carrera is this film's femme fatale and she is very over the top but she is incredibly enjoyable to watch in an otherwise dull movie. There is nothing visually appealing about Never Say Never Again, the cinematography is bland and the score is bad. But it still is fun for Sean Connery fans.",Never Say Never Again
136,Nolamoviedude,I'll try to forget this and remember Connery's Bond from Goldfinger,4,27 December 2018,This is not an official James Bond movie as it was not made by MGM studios. There was a loop hole in who owned the rights to Thunderball based on Ian Fleming not writing it all or something to that effect. So Warner Brothers got the rights and I'm sure paid handsomely to get Connery to come back and play his old character.The premise of the movie is that SPECTRE (they seemed to go away during the Roger Moore Bond films) has stolen 2 nuclear warheads and Bond has to find their locations before the detonate. This Bond is old and out of shape so he is ordered to lose a few pounds. Silly. Mr Bean is actually his colleague.....yes that Mr Bean. There's also a scene where Connery is walking with Kim Basinger shirtless in denim overalls. He looks like Simple Jack from Tropic Thunder. There has never been a less Bond outfit.I found the movie to be boring at times and didn't feel at all like a James Bond movie despite having the original Bond.,Never Say Never Again
137,Alberto-7,Sean Connery makes a welcome return to the role that made him a star,7,9 February 2004,"I saw this movie when it came out in 1983 and basically hated it. I recently got a chance to watch it again and was quite surprised that I actually enjoyed it. When the movie came out originally, a lot was made of the fact that it was not an ""official"" Bond film. Being a Bond fan, I bought into that thinking and didn't give this film a chance. On viewing it 20 years later, I am struck by many things: 1) It is GREAT to see Sean Connery as Bond again, even if he is now in his 50s. He is in terrific shape and really very good in the action sequences and fast on the quips. 2) Barbara Carrera is very enjoyable as an over-the-top femme-fatale. 3) The story moves at a good clip with some terrific exotic locations. I especially liked all the South of France sequences. 4) The action sequences are solid. The motorcycle chase is actually very well done and builds in tension. 5) Bernie Casey is the second best Felix Leiter after David Hedison (Live and Let Die, Licence to Kill). He is a great help to James. 6) The title song is weak and the rest of the score is less than memorable. 7) We have Rowan Atkinson(Mr. Bean)in a funny supporting role hamming it up in his two scenes. 8) Most of the other supporting cast is fine(especially Kim Basinger and Klaus Maria Brandaur)When you look at all the Bond films that followed, you realize that this was actually much better than we give it credit for. I can't understand why people put this down so much. Yes it is not an ""official"" Bond film but so what, it delivers in almost every department: Action, a solid hero, beautiful women, exotic locations, a tense story and several crazy villains. Only the music is weak. So many people have complained that it is missing the gunbarrel opening and the James Bond theme. Well these things are protected by copyright so they never could have used them in the first place. Get over it and enjoy Sean Connery as smooth as ever.",Never Say Never Again
138,rutherfordh-81993,"Not Brilliant, But Good",7,11 December 2020,"Never Say Never Again is considered by most people to not be a James Bond film in its own right. It has Sean Connery in, who is very impressive in this film. The action is quite good, but not exceptional. The locations such as the Bahamas and France look very good and are very effective. However, the music score is not as good as many other Bond films, and some of it seems to be a bit immature. Overall though, it is good, but just not excellent.",Never Say Never Again
139,TAEMO,One of the best!,8,4 January 2003,"I like this movie very much. It is not a real Bond, but who cares?The cast is great. Sean Connery reprising his role of James Bond after 12 years of absence. Ok, he looks a bit old, but he is better than ever. Klaus Maria Brandauer even tops Connerys acting, and portrays a good and lunatic villain, that is certainly better than Adolfo Celi´s version. I believe I don´t have to tell you about the Bond girl (Kim Basinger) and the rest of the supporting cast. (Rowan Atkinson, Max Von Sydow, Barbara Carrera).The director is also one of my favorites. Irvin Kershner, I like his work. He did a good job on this movie.The only flaw is the music, and I am not talking about the main title song, because this one is good, too. I mean, that the James Bond theme is missing. I believe they were not allowed to use it.Overall a very entertaining movie, certainly better than many other real James Bonds.P.S. In this movie, Bond and M don´t like each other much. Later this conflict was reused by the makers of Goldeneye. They were even using almost the same lines. Also the character of Vatima Blush very much reminds me of Xenia Onatop.",Never Say Never Again
140,MrVB,Bond at it's best,8,25 August 1999,"My, my.  People are SO anal retentive.  Let's see...This film wasn't produced by United Artists so it couldn't possibly be a REAL James Bond movie.  Yeah, sure, and Microsoft is evil unlike IBM, Exxon and Citibank who don't really just want to make money;  They REALLY want to be your friends.Everyone in this film seems to having a good time and that's one of the main reasons I enjoyed it so much.  Finally, a Bond movie where all the women are GORGEOUS (Barbara Carrera, Kim Bassinger, Valerie Leon, Lucy Hornack), the jokes are actually funny, the stunts are well staged and the plot is as confusing, long drawn out and non-sensical as all the other Bond films.ALL James Bond films are too long as the only segments that the public REALLY wants to see are the girls (almost always disappointing in my opinion), the gadgets and the chases.Please don't complain about the acting, script, plot development, music, etc...  All of these elements are by the numbers in all Bond movies.  The gist is how serious the film takes itself and if the pretentiousness is overwhelming.I have seen all the Bond movies waiting for some of the budget to go into the plot and script and have been consistently disappointed for the last 30 years.  If you want to see a GREAT spy film, see True Lies.I apologize for my seemingly tangential comments but they still make more sense than the average Bond film.The bottom line is that Bond aficionados may not enjoy this movie but others will.",Never Say Never Again
141,CosmicDwellings,A Welcome Return,7,21 July 2006,"The original Mr.Connery takes up his post where he left it in 1971's ""Diamonds Are Forever"" in this likable and entertaining kind of remake of 1965's ""Thunderball"". It is also classed as the controversial unofficial Bond film.Kevin McClory, who wrote the original story along with Jack Whittingham and Ian Fleming, excorsized his rights to make his own big screen version of the James Bond classic, and in the long run it appears to work. ""Never Say Never Again"" can't hold a torch to ""Thunderball"", but to have Sean Connery back in the role of 007 is a great bonus for this movie.It is quite unique in the fact that Bond is portrayed as an ageing operative for Her Majesty's Secret Service who hasn't been 'out in the field' for a long time. The disappearance of two nuclear warheads that have fallen into the hands of 'S.P.E.C.T.R.E.' soon gets our man back in the field. There are some nice stunts and set-pieces along with that usual mix of action, thrills and humour plus some great exotic locales.A fine cast is in support of Connery especially where the villains are concerned - Klaus Maria Brandauer and the sexy Barbara Carrera also make this a more than amicable movie to view. It's a fine updated take (at the time) on one of the biggest grossing Bond films in the franchise, and it's a shame that ""Never Say Never Again"" gets all the heavy criticism because of the nature of the movie and the nature in which it was made.I certainly feel that a couple of the Bond movies of recent times deserve more criticism for being too OTT compared to this movie, and I also feel the 'unofficial' tag should be dropped from this one.So, love it or hate it - he's back, it's Bond, deal with it!",Never Say Never Again
142,dangkoen,007 retires with a solid bang! *SPOILER ALERT!*,8,21 October 2014,"Retaining the film rights to the novel ""Thunderball"" following the infamous legal dispute with EON productions, Kevin McClory had his own version written, produced & released.How it played out? The cast is good here. Sean Connery is not quite as compelling in the 007 role as he used to be, but the sparks of suave & charm make us appreciate his surprising return to the role. Klaus Maria Brandauer turns in a magnetic outing as Largo, the man in charge of stealing 2 nuclear warheads for SPECTRE. Kim Basinger is solid here, followed closely by Barbara Carrera who gives an entertaining, diabolical performance as Fatima Blush.Interesting here however is Max Von Sydow. His interpretation of Blofeld isn't the usual large scale power hungry villain we're used to seeing, but a more calculated, almost corporate head like individual. It definitely gives Blofeld a more realistic feeling. A welcome change.Some inventive stunt & action sequences also give a fresh vibe to this unofficial Bond entry, I particularly enjoyed James Bond & Felix Leiter using a type of experimental aircraft to infiltrate Largo's cave at the film's climax. The motorcycle chase however is the film's highlight & the shark chase was creatively put together.The special effects were top notch for the time, I wonder if director Irvin Keshner was thinking about ""The Empire Strikes Back"" when he viewed the finished CGI effects.Though not considered canon, it is a good Bond film. Worth a watch for sure!",Never Say Never Again
143,prudhoeboy,Dancing With Cheese,7,2 August 2021,"Having watched Thunderball again after several years, I thought I would try Never Say Never Again even though last time watched it I said never again. Now I remember why - not an official Bond movie, no 007 theme song, cheesy villain, bleach Bond girl (Kim Bassinger), not the real Q and M, gaudy transitional computer tech, an aging already-hung-it-up Bond obviously doing it for the money and tired plot already done before. Only in the 1980s could a film producer get away with such cheese. If you can somehow put these issues aside, Never Say Never is arguably not a bad Bond movie. At least Bond is played by Connery not the ineffectual Timothy Dalton. Money Penny is also believable compared to latter Bond movies. The action sequences are entertaining and the changes to Thunderball's plot not all bad. The movie clarifies which character was actually Dominos brother but then commits the unforgivable sin of miscasting Domino. She's nothing in the movie and may as well have written her out.Every movie I have ever seen made in the 1980s has been cheesy. That entire decade was pretty much a cultural write off of big hair, gaudy tech, spandex and drugs. Still a relatively early 80s movie, Never Say Never dances with cheese, sort of a harbinger of things to come in that decade. That said, there are only so many Sean Connery Bond movies out there, and once you run out of the official ones, you really have little choice but bite the cheese on this one, even though last time you said never again.",Never Say Never Again

145,louiss,Never Play Bond Again,5,28 July 1999,"After years of anticipation and rumor Sean Connery finally returned to play James Bond again. Hopefully final can be said about Connery playing Bond and Kevin McClory producing another remake of Thunderball. Its incredible how much power in the Bond world McClory has just for being a script co writer on what was to originally have been the first Bond film Thunderball.  This is not to say Connery's performance was bad in NSNA but his lined face showed more age than the 52 years he had been around and although he looked to be in pretty good physical shape his screen presence was not as imposing as in the past. Connery however was still the best person to play Bond in 1983 since his 2 replacements Lazenby wooden and Moore also wooden and a clown couldn't match his cool confidence. I can only assume twelve years of mostly unheralded film flops , lots of money and perhaps a little envy at Moore's success motivated him to strap on his Walter PPK. Unfortunately NSNA like most of Connery's non EON produced Bond films was lackluster and disappointing. I can't think of any other film star in history the magnitude of Connery being in so many flops, Zardoz, The Terrorists,  The Next Man, I could go on forever. NSNA not being a EON produced Bond meant no gun barrel logo opening, No Maurice Binder titles, no Desmond LLewelyn as Q  , No John Barry score or Monty Norman James Bond theme and the lack of all of this hurt the film but there were many other problems. To start with the opening sequence where Bond appears to infiltrate a jungle stronghold is quite well done but is ruined when we find out its mearly a training exercise and this takes away from any excitement generated by the action. Edward Fox who plays a very annoying and obnoxious M dissatisfied with Bonds performance during the training exercise sends him off to heath clinic to get in better shape.  While at the clinic Bond gets in a fight with an indestructible assassin an attempt to be reminiscent of the fights in the 60's Bond films in fact the scene of Bond throwing a dumbbell that bounces off the chest of the assassin looks just like Bond throwing a gold bar which bounces off Oddjob's chest in Goldfinger. This fight and everything that's wrong with it sums up with what's wrong with the film. To start with it goes on too long and becomes absurd. It also looks very staged and lacks any excitement  and it doesn't have the fury of earlier Bond fights. The entire film lacks any exciting action with the exception of the short bike chase and the conclusion of the chase along with the demise of Fatima is silly. I did like Max Von Sydow as Blofield but there wasn't enough of him and too much of Klaus Maria Branauer who was a good villain for another type of film but not a Bond film. The two leading ladies were two of the best ever and Bernie Casey was one of the best Felix Leiter usually poorly cast in even the best Bond films. The film at times reminded me of the first two Bond films in pace and look but again unfortunately it didn't have the excitement or cool of those films. The highlight of the film for me was the World Domination game between Bond and Largo. I was fooled  for a while and thought  Bond was actually going to lose at something !!??  "" Bond never ever loses at anything on film or on paper excuse me he did lose a game of Gin Rummy to Solitaire in Live & Let Die "" when he was knocked by electric charge to the floor but of course he recovered to win the game .Only a year ago rumor again was that Connery was going to play Bond again with McCrory producing yet another remake of Thunderball !! Thank God this did not happen ! No one could ever compare to a young 30's early 40's Connery playing Bond but a near 70 James Bond !? Please Kevin McClory find something else to do and leave Bond films to EON & the Broccoli's..",Never Say Never Again
146,grandpagbm,Better Than I Expected,8,3 November 2008,"This is an excellent James Bond movie. Although it is not part of the original and more famous series, and it is a standalone film, it is very well done. Enticing Sean Connery to return to the role he made famous was a stroke of genius, as was titling the movie in a way that references his past vow to not play Bond again. Connery was as great as he was in his earlier 007 appearances. The script is outstanding, as are the photography and the performances. It's the earliest movie I recall with Kim Basinger, who became much more famous after this film; Barbara Carrera was excellent; and Klaus Maria Brandauer was absolutely perfect as the main villain. The frequent references to the aging of Bond and the changing times and attitudes of the British secret service were most humorous. The 007 gadgets equaled those of the other Bond films. The only thing missing was the famous 007 music theme, which, of course, could not be used by this competing production. It was rather amazing to me to be able to see two excellent James Bond movies released in the same year, this one and Octopussy with Roger Moore. An interesting aspect of the film is an emphasis on video games and computer graphics. The early 80's were the first heyday of such things, and the use of them in this film made it a very contemporary movie. The film is actually a different version of Thunderball, updated with newer technology. Regardless of the repeated theme, there are sufficient differences to make it most entertaining. I will watch this one frequently.",Never Say Never Again
147,loveagoodstory,A sorry entry in the Bond archives,2,14 April 2015,"As a lifelong Bond enthusiast, I saw this film at the cinema when it came out and so judged it from a contemporary view and again on a recent re-watching. It contains a few of the things that make a good Bond film and a lot more that make the weaker British films of the 70's/80's. Unfortunately, this gives the finished result a very unsatisfying tone.The cast are fine in doing well what they're given to do. I wish Edward Fox wasn't given M to play as shouting and hollering at his most successful agent, as if cantankerousness alone indicates a high standard of leader. The music drags the mood down and that's an error of commissioning a composer, not of the composer. The computer game sequence is a lame attempt to put the then-phenomenon of computer graphics into a serious context. But the audience isn't playing the game so they can't feel the player's drama. The list of such defects is too long.I wanted this to be just a satisfactory film if it couldn't be a good film. A lot of Bond films are flawed, particularly Moore's of that era, so there's a lot of give and take available. This just need to take too much suspension of belief for me, not in the story but in the film- making. If you get a different experience from watching it, that's great but I don't expect you to.",Never Say Never Again
148,A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor,A pointless exercise in retelling the same story (SPOILERS),5,16 March 2005,"Bond fans from 1983 must've had to decide which Bond film they were going to see; there was the Roger Moore ""official"" Eon Bond outing ""Octopussy"" and Sean Connery's return to the role that made him famous in ""Never Say Never Again"". Watching these two films today, and the choice seems obvious: Moore's ""Octopussy"" is a fun, energetic film with an involving story while Connery's effort is so lifeless and dull that it would take the audience a few cups of coffee and multiple viewings just to get through it once.""Never Say Never Again"" was made because it's Kevin McClory's only claim to fame. He clung to his minimal rights of James Bond for as long and stubbornly as possible, proving to be a major thorn in everyone's side by suing the Bond producers for everything they did with the organization SPECTRE and depriving the fans a proper send-off to arch-villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld. The film is a loose remake of the 1965 film ""Thunderball"" and of the novel by Ian Fleming, so details of the two are mixed into this film along with a lot of original ideas. There lies the problem with the movie: it doesn't have that larger-than-life feel that the Eon films combined with the original novels, and ends up desperately needing a pulse.It all starts with an average pre-credit sequence of sorts that unfortunately doesn't compare to the ones from the official series. This scenes also features an earsplitting song that ranks as one of the worst in the Bond canon, official or not. The one thing the beginning, and the rest of the film, does well is show a Bond that's older and not as physically strong, providing a vulnerability that's never exploited to its full potential. But then the question would be why would MI6 keep an agent that should've collected his pension by now? (to be fair, it's nice that they updated the character for Connery's older age) Like ""Thunderball"", ""Never Say Never Again"" follows an almost identical path with Bond trying to prevent a plot by SPECTRE to blackmail NATO with a threat of two nuclear detonations somewhere in the world. It's basically the same, but the section at the health clinic is shortened so that it barely resembles what happened in ""Thunderball"". Consequently, more time is focused in the Bahamas and with Lorenzo Semple Jr.'s original ideas than following the book or film.This can be seen as positive, because enough material is new so that we don't get a sense of déja vu. Some of these additions are good, like Bond having to train/get check-ups at the clinic and the scene in the casino where he makes a guard believe that his cigarette case is a bomb. Others, like the ""Domination"" challenge and Domino exercising in leg warmers, are cheesy in the way only dated 1980's films can be.The cast is of the hit-and-miss quality. Sean Connery, returning 12 years after ""Diamonds Are Forever"", is great as Bond. He actually looks like he's interested and enjoying himself, even though the characterization is almost missing. Klaus Maria Brandauer gives a much more energetic personality to Largo than Adolfo Celi did in the original version and manges to make the character his own, while veteran actor Max Von Sydow gives class to Blofeld.On the flip side, Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush is too over-the-top to fit in with the rest of the film and Kim Basinger does nothing to stand out as Domino. Then there's the MI6 staff, who's so boring that it's an insult to think that Bernard Lee plays the same character as Edward Fox. And Rowan Atkinson shows up as comic relief that, while pretty funny, again seems out of place.The film is also hurt by the fact that there are no Bond trademarks (gun barrel, theme music, etc.), the score is instantly forgettable, the direction is uninspired and too quaint, and the action is all pretty dull, especially the motorcycle chase and underwater ending. Finally, the spark needed to keep interest is unsurprisingly missing and the movie feels twice as long as it actually is, even though it's already too long in the first place! So, in the end, ""Never Say Never Again"" falls into the decent range. It's not terrible, but it isn't worth your while and no one should actively go out looking for this movie unless they're Bond die hards. ""Thunderball"" is easily the superior version of the story, but to rank this film along with the 1967 utter failure, ""Casino Royale"", is grossly unfair.

Connery is 52 years of age , looks really out of shape and looks about 10 years older than he actually is. You have him scaling buildings and doing stupid things like jumping off a building about 70 stories high on a horse and into the sea ( everyone knows you would survive......right?) the action scenes mostly involve bond getting his ass kicked and then somehow beating the bad guys ( like a rocky film). On the whole the film is a total let down and is like watching Victor Meldrew hitting (or should i say trying to hit) people and then getting thrown around a health spa and into windows.

It's not all bad, and it's not all great, somehow wavering strangely down the middle. I think that most early to mid eighties films are going to look dated by now, so I don't feel that this is a valid criticism. Also the theme isn't so bad in a crappy soft jazz format/Sade sort of way that was trendy then! I just recall how I felt about it at the time of it's release. I recall hearing about the legal battles it took just to get it made, and I feel like others do that this really hurt the film from the beginning. I was also excited to hear that Sean Connery was going to reprise his role as Bond, and I was curious how he would handle it after a little more than a decade absence from the role. My first impression was he did ok, but with the absence of the other usual character actors and the legal troubles that interfered with the creative process and production, I felt that perhaps it was a film that really didn't need to be made at all. Perhaps Connery and Company jumped too soon and a wait until Roger Moore's exit from the official Bond franchise with the 1985 Bond film ""View to a kill"" would have been a better time for Connery to have stepped back into the role of Bond. It might even be plausible to have him do another Bond film today, even with him being older and with the right kind of script! I CAN imagine it and I think it would be most cool indeed! Mr. Connery is a fine and enduring actor with a great many awesome films to his credit before and since NSNA. As a longstanding ""A"" list actor, Sean Connery has always tried to seek out new and different kinds of roles outside of the Bond franchise. Of course, we the public will always see him as the definitive Bond even in a sometimes troubled film such as NSNA.",Never Say Never Again

154,electrictroy,Better than Octopussy - Connery is brilliant,10,27 August 2005,"Background info - The movies Octopussy & Never Say Never Again were both made the same year, 1983, and so naturally people compare them. Moore vs. Connery. Bond vs. Bond.I've heard many people claiming that the ""official movie"" Octopussy is far superior. Well, I just watched Octopussy. Bond is riding an airplane at 100 miles an hour (impossible---the wind would blow him off), using his feet to force the plane to ground, and then jumping off at some 60 miles an hour (again impossible---try jumping out of your car---you'd end up with a shattered body). How is that octopussy scene supposed to be ""good"" in any sense of the word? Suddenly Bond has super-human strength & a titanium body. And he does all these stunts at the ancient age of 56??? Complete crap. Unbelievable. Farse.---> Now let's contrast the above scene with Connery's ""unofficial"" Never Say Never Again: It doesn't have the same polish due to its independent film status (less money), but at least you can believe that Connery is a real spy in real danger.The movie starts off with Bond showing his age (he is 50 after all) and being sent off for recuperation. Entirely believable. But of course, there's no such thing as a ""day off"" for a world-famous spy, and Bond quickly finds himself a target, even inside the hospital. From that point the story spins off into another adventure, with Bond trying to locate his attempted killers and ultimately foiling an attempt to steal nuclear weapons.As usual Sean Connery did a brilliant job, and avoids the over-the-top/unbelievable stunts. This movie feels like a natural successor to Connery's last film, 1971's Diamonds Are Forever... the old style of Bond... before the franchise got silly.Highyly recommended.",Never Say Never Again

Or Lazenby, Brosnan, or even David Niven, for that matter. I personally found Octopussy and Moonraker, among other ""canonical"" Bond films, to be far more entertaining than this, and probably for the very same reasons why others deprecate the Moore Bond films, namely their wry humor, and their willingness to surrender to the preposterousness of the whole basic Bond milieu.",Never Say Never Again

The movie just plods along, but never makes you say wow like the other Bond movies have done. I can't take Sean Connery playing Bond in a movie that lacks anything new and exciting. His acting is good as always, but it is like watching him in a remake of ""Hunt for Red October"". What's the point? I liked the original ""Thunderball"" but I don't need to see a remake that lacks inspiration. I have all the Bond DVD movie sets and even the comedy ""Casino Royale"" which although the same title as an Ian Fleming book, has nothing in common with the book. I will not buy this movie though since the story isn't new and the movie is only mediocre.

It's supposed to be a ""james bond"" film, and it does have Sean Connery, who tries really hard, but, at that point he was already getting too old for action type roles. He should have left the classic Bond he did back in the 60's.This has James Bond in it, but it's NOT a James Bond film. Wny? Mostly not made by the production team (A. Broccoli) Studio (MGM) and distributor (United Artists) that made the ""official"" Bond films. It DOES make a difference.

161,Orpington,Connery returns as Bond one last time in an entertaining Thunderball remake,6,23 September 2003,"After walking away from the Bond franchise following the release of Diamonds are Forever in 1971, Sean Connery vowed that he would ""never again"" play the role of OO7. 12 years on, however, he was persuaded to pick up the Walther PPK for a seventh and final time in this, an unofficial remake of Thunderball. At the time NSNA was badly received, and it was trounced at the Box Office by a rival official Bond film starring Roger Moore, Octopussy. However, while it is not a great film NSNA is still worth a watch, and has some definite virtues.The first of these is Connery's return to the part that had made him famous twenty years earlier. In truth, Connery was really too old by 1983 to be playing Bond (he was in his early fifties), but in spite of his lined face and rather obvious hairpiece he does turn in a spirited and charismatic performance, and seems to be enjoying himself. What is more, the film makes a few sly jokes about Connery's advancing years early on in proceedings, and sensibly does not try to convince us that we are watching a sleek secret agent in the prime of life; this tongue-in-cheek aspect is an appealing element of the film.Generally speaking, NSNA follows the same storyline as Thunderball, and it is actually superior to the earlier film, which I consider to be one of the weaker entries in the Bond canon. The plot is fairly simple to follow, there is some good action, and the overlong underwater sequences that plagued Thunderball are absent.  The villains are much better too. Klaus Maria Brandaeur is excellent as Largo, playing the part with far more style and charisma than Adolfo Celi managed, although he could perhaps have been a little more sinister. Barbara Carrera is also entertaining, if a bit too OTT, as the vampish Fatima Blush, and she steals many of the scenes she appears in. Max von Sydow makes for an effective Blofeld, although he does not have much in common with the Blofelds of the official films. Still, this will probably remain the last film to feature Bond's arch-enemy, and it is good to have him back, even if only for a limited amount of screen time. As for Bond's allies, Bernie Casey is good value as the only black Felix Leiter, and the great Rowan Atkinson puts in a welcome, if rather incongruous, appearance as a hapless British diplomat. Ironically, of course, Atkinson has gone on recently to spoof the Bond films in Johnny English.Despite its good points the film also has some obvious weaknesses. For one thing it lacks the production values of the official series, and looks more like a cheap TV movie than a Bond film. The unofficial nature of the film also means that it lacks the normal title sequence we all know and love, and M, Q and Moneypenny are all played by different actors, who feel like impostors. Edward Fox makes for a poor M, and Alec McCowen's cockney Q (who for some reason is called Algernon in this film), is no match for the great Desmond Llewellyn. In one of her early acting roles Kim Basinger is adequate as Domino, but makes the character too weak and uninteresting to be regarded as a great Bond girl, although she does look nice. Michel Legrand's music and Lani Hall's weak title song also drag the film down, and so does a very dated scene in which Bond and Largo are involved in an arcade game duel, which is VERY early 80s and is not the kind of thing you would expect to find in a Bond film. The final showdown between the two men is also a little bit rushed and disappointing.In spite of these weaknesses, NSNA generally manages to be an amusing and entertaining film, if rather naff at the same time. It is not a patch on Connery's classic early Bond films, but it passes the time well enough and enables Connery to make a reasonably dignified last bow as OO7.",Never Say Never Again
162,ymamedy,Resplendent,10,2 August 2001,"Many have disparaged Never Say Never Again because it is not an official Bond movie.  Nevertheless, it is manifest that the producers adhered to the fruitful Bond formula.  Although the film does not have a pre-credit sequence, it is clear that the training exercise at the commencement of the film is meant to be the introductory scene.  It would have been impossible for EON to stop the producers from including a pre-credit and title sequence, albeit without the gun-barrel introduction.Sean Connery is on fine form as the immortal secret agent and this film is certainly better than Dr No, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice and Diamonds Are Forever.  Although, NSNA is meant to be a remake of Thunderball, it is a vast improvement.  007 spends more time on terra firma and a more diverse range of exotic locations are included in the film.  There is some resplendent acting in this movie.  Barbara Carrera is impeccable as the bizarre Fatima Blush.  One of the best scenes in the film is the coup de grace between Bond and Fatima in Nice, which is preceded by a dynamic motorcycle chase through the city.  Klaus Maria Brandauer plays the psychotic Largo and Max Von Sydow is free of the melodrama that other actors portraying Blofeld have indulged in.NSNA tends to centre on Connery rather than the character of Bond.  At the commencement it is stated that Bond is ageing and has been out of action. This seems to refer to the 12 year hiatus in Connery's portrayal of Bond. Bond promises ""never again"" to work in the Secret Service; an allusion to Connery's portrayal of Bond.  It appears that the producers were trying to hurt the official Bond franchise.  Nevertheless, this film is definitely worth watching.  This is the last time that Sean Connery played James Bond, but his performance convinced me that perhaps he should have never have said ""never again"".",Never Say Never Again
163,anders-rock,"""Thunerball"" remake lacks thunder and balls",4,12 March 2011,"The title of this movie refers to an interview with Sean Connery who said he would never play Bond again. So it's basically just saying: ""We've got Sean Connery for you."" and that seems to be the only reason why people should be interested in this. It's a remake of the fourth official Bond film ""Thunderball"" and while it was not the best it was certainly not the worst. The biggest thing ""Thunderball"" had going for it was a very visible high budget with it's colorful sets and some pretty big action set pieces near the end and this is where this remake fails big time. The sets look like... well, sets and the action scenes (which there aren't many of) are lazy, unambitious and worst of all unexciting. A possible exception is a motorcycle chase which is just OK. The cast are nothing special either. Connery still has the charm and wit and occasionally he does pull the humor off well but he is clearly getting to old for this sh*t and the masculinity that made him so credible in his first four outings as 007 is gone then again that might have more to do with the light tone of the film. Klaus Brandauer is the exact opposite of Adolpho Celi who played Largo in ""Thunderball"". While there wasn't a lot of depth to Celi's character he was really good at barking orders and looking menacing but Brandauer on the other hand is a very suave and nice looking gentleman while being a little neurotic and he's not very threatening. Kim Bassinger honestly sucks and Barbara Carera is unworthy of comparison to Lucianna Paluzzi in ""Thunderball"". There are some positive things to say though. The humorous moments are pretty decent and at times it works fine as a comedy but while this movie isn't necessarily boring it's never really exciting either. While Bond movies mostly are very tongue in cheek this one never really seems to try convincing the audience that there is something at stakes. It's quite ironic that this is a remake of Thunderball because it simply lacks thunder and balls.",Never Say Never Again
164,Anscules,"Bond's Worst - easily outdoing even ""Casino Royale""",4,5 March 2000,"Sad in every aspect, this poor excuse for a career boost for Connery was neither that nor the hit Warners wanted it to be.  Overlong by 20 minutes and filled with embarrassing moments for everyone involved, this film and ""Robocop 2"" are proof that Irvin Kershner did not have any real control over ""The Empire Strikes Back.""  Connery hadn't been in a hit since he bowed out from Bond in 1971, but this didn't bring him back at all.  ""Octopussy"" was released several months before this film, and easily outgrossed it. Imagine that - a Roger Moore Bond not only better than a simultaneous Connery release, but outgrossing it (and compared to ""Never...,"" ""Octopussy"" is on par with ""2001.""The worst Bond theme song, even worse than ""The Man with the Golden Gun,"" pointless scenes that drag on pointlessly (with the worst example being that ridiculous video game sequence - MY GOD  - WHO CARES?!), and the most atrocious collection of non-talent as far as the fabled ""Bond Girls"" go. Does anybody SERIOUSLY think Kim Basinger is attractive in this movie? There were girls in my high school who could never get dates who looked better than she does in this.  And Barbara Carrera - just plain stupid - but the way Kershner has directed her to prance around all the time didn't help her out any.  She is the seedling that would become the very impressive ""Onatop,"" which was about the best feature of ""GoldenEye,"" but that doesn't mean anything as you laboriously struggle through this film.Casting Leiter as a black agent was an excellent idea, but the buddy-loke interaction Connery and he are supposed to have is awfully bad.

165,thomas-williamson-ga,a welcomed return for Connery,8,25 March 2011,"For those of you who were old enough to have seen this when it hit theaters, you might recall that Never Say Never ran along side another Roger Moore 007 film released near the same time. I will go more into that on a later review. As for Never Say Never, some critics ripped this unofficial bond title into shreds. Other critics welcomed the unofficial title as a twist on the franchise. As for myself, I agree with the latter critics. For those who don't know (hopefully IMDb won't consider this remark a spoiler), Never Say Never is a LOOSE remake of the much earlier Thunderball. I put the word 'loose' in all caps for a reason: While the plot and characters of Thunderball share some similarities with Thunderball, the overall timeline of the story takes place in between Moonraker and Your Eyes Only (I will further explain this in my review of Your Eyes Only). The reason Never Say Never is labeled an unofficial bond title is because it was produced by Warner Bros. studios with a different producer/director and not by United Artists/MGM. Still, don't let this statement gear you away from viewing this title. Never Say Never delivers greatly on the action and special effects of 007 and reminded many viewers why Sean Connery might possibly have been voted ""best bond actor"" as of recent. Is this to say Never Say Never is near perfect? Well, not really. Even at two hours and 30 minutes, there are some minor pacing issues that could have been trimmed a little. Regardless, the overall pacing is still acceptable especially when compared to Thunderball... have mercy!! Moving on; I have always liked the actress Kim Basinger and while she might not have been some peoples' choice for the bond girl in this film, she can act to some degree and is (or was) very good looking back in the early 80's when this was filmed. As for one of the two villains, those of you who thought Ernest Blofeld a.k.a Spectre #1 met his end on Diamonds Are Forever might be in for a shock. Overall, some James Bond purists will disregard Never Say Never simply because it is not an official Albert R.

One great things about it is the beautiful cinematography. The movie is mostly shot in the Bahamas and the shots are very pretty. The movie relies mostly on dialog and situational entertainment. This movie has a beautiful laid back nature to it. From the beginning when Bond is at the health spa to later when he is diving in tropic waters and then at the end when he is sitting back in a hot tub with the beautiful Domino who is played by Kim Basinger. The acting by the main villain Largo was superb even by real acting standards. This character is a real life person unlike the modern Bond villains that are totally unbelievable. He plays the role of the psychotic entrepreneur very well and his performance is definitely worth watching. This movie was mostly realistic and that is why it is so great.This was Sean Connery's last James Bond film which gives it a special kind of appeal. I felt like Connery was in fantastic shape for his age and played his role to the hilt. The plot is a remake of the movie ThunderBall yet i think they made an even better movie this time around.Sit back with your beverage of choice and watch this movie with your wife or girlfriend as it is not overly violent and the movie is entertaining enough to keep anyone interested.This is my favorite Bond film and i give it 10 stars!,Never Say Never Again
174,zennokangae,Hardest Bond Villain to Cast,4,24 December 2004,"Thunderball and Never are two of the biggest box office misses and Never is a surprise farce from Empire Strikes Back hero Irvin Kershner. Klaus Maria Brandauer seems to steal the show, when, in the midst of the unfolding plot, Bond's mission turns more to Hollywood romp (Sometime around when Basinger comes in). How about Klaus Kinski? I still think that the casting of Largo makes or, as is evident in both films, breaks the story. Worst of all is the attempt to pass off the aging and very hairy Connery off as the sex symbol he indeed was in the '60s. The '80s was a barren time for Bond flicks mostly, though For Your Eyes Only is a great title.

The story is okay, though the main plot line about the stolen nuclear bombs tends to get lost quite a bit.Two characters actually detract from the movie. First, Felix Leiter, from Ian Fleming's second book ""Live and Let Die"" onward, was a one-legged, one-armed Texas white guy, not a big black hunk of an ex-football player of the type that makes my oldest daughter drool. Even in the movies, Felix was more of an analyst than a field man. Bernie Casey does a good job with the role, but that's just not Felix. Second, and more important, Everett Fox is a TERRIBLE M. Both in the books and the movies, M, as first portrayed by Bernard Lee and then by Robert Brown, was a stern military type who wouldn't take any guff and was always dignified, but fair and always supportive of his people. This guy is a whining, tantrum-throwing bean counter who seems to have as much use for his agents as he has for a third nostril. Lee and Brown should be spinning in their graves every time somebody watches this movie.That said, Connery turns in a typically Connery performance, Kim Basinger is adorable and sexy, and nobody can help but absolutely love the incredible Barbara Carrera as the red-hot, terrifying lunatic Fatima Blush. She is by far the movie's greatest performance.There's plenty of action, and the story in its details is different enough from Thunderball to hold a viewer's interest. Still, a remake is a remake, so unless they were to change the ending and blow up a city somewhere or something, it's hard to feel much tension. Die-hard Bond fans like me will watch it because it's a Bond movie, but with a little more thought to casting and such, it could have been a lot better.",Never Say Never Again
178,Saintly-2,Who Dropped the 007 Bomb?,4,27 August 1999,"This is more than just an adaptation of Bond:  it's a plain rip off!  With mediocre character sketches that Ian Fleming would not have approved of, this film goes down as the worst 007 movie.  An older (even haggard) Connery tries to relive his past 12 years later.  The result is a humourless, tacky version of the classic hero.  Give me Roger Moore any day!",Never Say Never Again
179,tmchacko,One of the five BEST Bonds!,10,27 January 2003,"Let me depart from many comments I've read here, and say that this film ranks as one of the five best Bonds, along with On Her Majesty's Secret Service, From Russia With Love, Licence To Kill, and For Your Eyes Only (the ONLY time Roger Moore actually played the role of Bond, instead of futzing around). Of course, Sean Connery pulls the whole thing together -- as co-writer, co-producer, and in his best performance since From Russia With Love. He is fit, energetic, and obviously enjoying himself. His acting is mature, confident, and laced with the right amount of humour. This is in contrast to his mechanical performance in Thunderball, his sleepwalking through You Only Live Twice, and his jowly, paunchy romp through that cartoon known as Diamonds Are Forever!This is an imaginative reworking of Thunderball, without having the sets and machines overwhelming the characters and plot. This cast is far superior, as well. Klaus Maria Brandauer brings his unique style to the role of Largo, without relying on an eyepatch, SPECTRE ring or a boring uniform. Kim Basinger is athletic and lovely, Barbara Carrera is dynamic, and for once, we have a great Felix Leiter in Bernie Casey. The depictions of M and Q are original, and the addition of the bumbling agent Small-Fawcett is fun without lapsing into slapstick.Director Irvin Kershner makes good use of his locations (the Bahamas and the French Riviera) without losing sight of his actors. Although close inspection reveals some mediocre special effects and lapses in continuity, Kershner keeps the film moving at a good pace, unlike Thunderball (which even its director, Terence Young, did not like). Obviously fans will miss the gun-barrel trademark and the 007 theme music, but they are, after all, owned by Eon Productions.Michel LeGrand may not have composed the most memorable score, but it captures the atmosphere of the locations without being overly intrusive. Not surprisingly, his best moments are in the south of France, with his French love song (at the health spa) being particularly attractive. And tell me, how many really remember the music for Moonraker? I personally would rather forget Man With the Golden Gun and A View To a Kill!The Eon folks can sneer at this film if they like. (Yes, Octopussy made more money.) At least Connery's mature 007 didn't swing through the jungle emitting a Tarzan yell. He did not frolic with a Bengal tiger, nor did he fight off ""Indian"" snake charmers with a tennis racket. Despite Eon's desperate efforts to stop this production, Kevin McClory and the late Jack Schwartzman put together a fine film, one that I think Ian Fleming would have appreciated.If, however, you would rather see James Bond get kicked in the shins by a dwarf, engage in another tiresome struggle with ""Jaws"", jump into bed with Grace Jones, or lead a slapstick firetruck chase through San Francisco, this is NOT the film for you!",Never Say Never Again
180,Judd-Half-Nelson,"Prop technology, music, and actor ""business"".",2,16 January 2005,"The use of technology as an integral prop on an almost per-scene basis is superb - for any bond film really. Each prop is used appropriately, including the fictional ones! In the TV scenes, each actor either uses or reacts to the TV in very convincing ways - unlike in perhaps a Battle Star Galctica episode! The diving scenes were acted with such subtlety on everyone's part that it is obvious that each actor was either a diver or became one for the film. Largo's accent (the real actor's?) is quite interesting, with an almost Walken-esquire delivery. Not until the installment of the Brosnan-ator will we see such perfection in props, usage and expertise among the actors in researching their ""business"".Sorry to say here about the music.....? No, I must blow off steam here, the music is both terrible for a bond film and recorded horribly bad. Terrifically bad. The intonation and perhaps even the recordist's interpretation of speed control of the dubs is laughable. The music is most uncharacteristic of any other bond film as well. It has the sound and fell of most Avenger (TV) series' episodes where in that series is no doubt perfect, but without Steed, Peel and Mystery as such sounds completely out of place and touch with any Bond mystery. Oh, yes then there is the actual notes and chords and non-bond motifs that, and we know that ""The David"" knows this, every single Bond film cannot stand to be without! The ending sequence however where most if not all other Bond films end with the main henchman (or ""men"" when you count Diamonds) still trying to kill the Bond, in Never Again we see Mr. Bean (yes, THAT Rowan Atkinson!) being treated at first as if he were about to kill, ends up....well.It is almost as if the whole film were somehow ""trying"" to wink at the Bond genre (or the ""Bondre"", if you will).Perhaps I will never again want to comment on Never Again. Even most of the one-liners suck. Talk about your spoilers.Moon Raker better by 1 point.",Never Say Never Again
181,Beretta92F,THE ONLY REAL 007 IS BACK!!!!,10,31 August 2002,"People criticize NSNA because it is a low-point in Bond god Sean Connery's career, and because it is unofficial. ***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* First of all, this movie is better then any other bond film featuring any other actor then Connery, all sub par wannabes in my book. Sean Connery is the only real Bond, no one comes even close to his toughness, good looks and sex appeal. Yes, this movie is a low point in Connery's Bond career, but it is still the definet best bond film of the 80's. Sean Connery is the only Bond actor who is good at an older age. he did not become a baggy mess like Moore, but kept his good looks and toughness, but gaining some gray hair. So what? hes still the only real 007, and he is as cool, and tough as ever. Sean Connery is the one and only 007. And this movie is definitly worth seeing, no matter what anyone says.

182,MazzyToU,Bad remake of a bad original,1,17 September 2017,"Where can I start? I never liked Thunderball, apart from the title song which is exceptional. This feels flat, lifeless and empty. Sean Connery is fine being James Bond. Apart from that, its just a bore-fest.Virtually a shot for shot remake with a few new scenes shoved in here and there in an attempt to distance itself from the original. The music is bizarre in places, especially the car chase scene, which is one of the few highlights of this dreary thing. On Connery's part it was just for the money. Some of them other actors seem overexcited leading them to ultra-ham the dialog. All this wanders aimlessly to the usual JB ending where the bad guy dies and Bond gets the girl.My advice? You want to see a great Bond film, try Goldfinger or Skyfall.",Never Say Never Again
183,craig1960,Connery back as Bond,8,4 February 2005,"From what I've been reading here, I think this may be the most under rated Bond film in the history of the series. It has all the elements of a great Bond film, beautiful women, a great villain, exotic locations and cool gadgets. Maybe one of the last great Bond films. It was released as an unofficial bond film and hit theaters along with Roger Moore's official bond film, ""Octopussy"". This should have been Roger Moore's last film as Bond. Roger looked a little too old and out of shape in ""A View To A Kill"". Roger, at his worst, can beat Dalton and Brosnan at playing Bond but Sean Connery, here in his last Bond role after a 12 year absence, plays the role even better.Never Say Never is not as good as Goldfinger or Dr No but can stand right up there with the rest of the earlier Bond films. The movie is interesting from start to finish with some good fight scenes. Connery plays a very cool, mature Bond.Kim Basinger is the most beautiful bond women ever. Max Von Sydow is great as Largo and Barbera Carrera is excellent as Fatima Blush. This movie is supposed to be a remake of Thunderball but it is as much better as it is different.",Never Say Never Again

Carrera as Fatima Blush is simply ravishing. I have caught this movie various times on cable, and every time I hear Fatima Blush proclaim ""I am the best"" and strut around in her sexy nurse's uniform I fall in love all over again. As soon as she gets quite lamely blown away by Bond, I always change the channel. The final half hour of the film is simply not worth watching without Fatima. Kim Basinger's vapid performance really pales in comparison. Unfortunately, Carrera never made another memorable film again.",Never Say Never Again

And in thunder ball the NATO / RAF itself loads the nukes into plane and in Never Say Never Again it is changed by an ""rouge arm of the Axe"" and air dropped over US and stolen in Caribbean.

Never Say Never Again is an updated and improved version of Thunderball (Connery's least popular bond flick). NSNA is rich with clever dialogue, wit, smarts, sex appeal, and one of the best and most convincing bad guys in the entire Bond series. In addition, NSNA features a very talented young and beautiful Kim Basinger. British comedy fans will also recognize the actor (Attwood), known as, ""Mr. Bean."" I wouldn't trade any of the Moore pictures for this one. However the earlier Connery/Bond efforts (with the exception of ""Thunderball,"") are superior.",Never Say Never Again

Seamlessly edited and photographed to portray Connery in good middle age! This film goes well for endless viewing criteria, plus Atkinson is a bonus. Best moment- Domination of the world, ""Play"". For the interest of 'Internet Movie Data Base' a few more line must be added. Certainly this is a strange picture considering Connery's success with James Bond yet without his stature 'Never Say Never Again' would not exist. This creates an unusual scenario that is well contained by the director by not emphasizing either Sean or the falsified story. Brilliantly faked horse jumping and jet pack flying at the end is spoilt by the nuke rockets speeding over pastures green.",Never Say Never Again
189,MrMuscleHead,"Focus on the women, not the script",5,4 January 2008,"Even a bad James Bond movie has considerable entertainment value. Unfortunately, Never Say Never Again IS a bad James Bond movie. This time, SPECTRE has stolen a pair of nuclear weapons and is demanding tribute from the world's wealthiest nations. Bond, played by Sean Connery, finds himself up against a megalomaniac and his own boss, M, who disapproves of the 00 agents. The 00 boss disapproving of the 00's is one of a number of script elements that doesn't make much sense to the alert viewer.Connery's acting is the only selling point of this film (Too old? No way!) Klaus-María Brandauer as Maximilian Largo is a peculiar villain that certainly comes off as mad, but not really threatening. Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush is more than threatening, but perhaps she is hamming it up a bit too much for the cameras. Kim Basinger has all of the beauty of a Barbie doll, but her character, Domino Petachi has only slightly more personality than a Barbie doll.The Bond women have all of the sex appeal that you expect, but the gadgets, the stunts, the soundtrack, and the climax all fall short. Viewers with some passion for 007 movies will not want to miss this. More casual viewers have better options available.",Never Say Never Again
190,eon014,Even Sean Connery cant save this mess,3,30 August 2006,"I am a huge Bond fan and Sean Connery is also my favourite Bond. Now when I first saw this film I was much younger and probably didn't notice most of it's faults (because it had Sean Connery, it must be good) But now I've watched it a 3rd time, I now realise Never Say Never Again is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. I couldn't possibly watch it in one sitting as I'd be on the brink of suicide by the final scene.Yes, there are some highlights, the opening sequence is exciting but it is ruined by the horrendous theme tune that's played over the top of it. There is also an abundance of good dialogue (Fatima: Oh, I got you all wet; Bond: Yes, but my martini's still dry) and some interesting locations but they are sadly, wasted. Bond visits two of the most beautiful locations in the world, The Bahamas and the French Riviera and yet we see about 60 seconds of them on-screen before he's shipped off to somewhere else.For most of the film there is hardly any reference to the actual plot (the stolen nuclear devices) at all, it seems as if Bond treats his 'mission' as a holiday where he can bed as many women as possible (4 on this occasion). The action sequences are incredibly boring and predicable, and the underwater shots lack any imagination or flair. Its hard to believe that this was directed by Irvin Kershner, who was responsible for the superb 'Empire Strikes Back'.As for the characters, if you can call them that, they are probably the most boring and 1-dimensional of any bond film. The villain is almost non-existent, Kim Basinger is the most useless Bond girl to date (including Mary goodnight) and serves no purpose in the story at all. The (attempt at a) femme fatale, Fatima Blush is also truly dire. An awful character played by an equally awful actress, the adolescent producers obviously think they can make her 'sexy' by having her keep snakes in her car, heroin needles in her garter, and have her prance about in leather trousers and nurse's outfits whilst cackling like an old hag.NSNA looks terribly dated, and it is only 23 years old. The set pieces are poorly-thought out and look cheap (probably because most of the films budget was spent on getting Connery back) The majority of the script is dull and clichéd and the entire film looks like it was edited in about 5 minutes. And when the film finally reaches a climax, it refuses to end. There is still about another 20 minutes of tedium before it slowly comes to a halt. An incredibly boring and pointless film, even the worst movies in the official series (golden gun and die another day) are more entertaining than this. It's no surprise Sean Connery refuses to watch the Bond films, this wasn't exactly a high-point in his career.",Never Say Never Again

192,thockman,Great movie except for music and some poor editing,6,12 August 2005,"First, the music is horrendous. Michel Legrand committed a vile sin with this so-called score. We've come to expect so much from Bond music to lift the tone and action of the movie that this pathetic selection of musical noodlings hardly qualifies as a score by any stretch. The movie stretches on a little too long because the editing doesn't keep the movie moving at a proper pace.Now, the good side. Sean was back, and he was at his best since Goldfinger. He was in great shape for his age (53), and delivered his performance with energy and wit - qualities that were somewhat lacking in his later official Bond movies due to boredom with the character. Fatima Blush makes a great villain, and Kim Basinger was pretty good as a Bond girl. The spirited scenes between the new M and Q also gave some good characters for Sean to play Bond off of. Another humorous bit comes from Rowan Atkinson as a diplomatic futz. Finally, Max Von Sydow plays a nasty Blofeld. There is a fan-based special edition of the movie you can preview at http://neversaymccloryagain.ohmss-007.com/index.html that is much improved on the theatrical version.",Never Say Never Again
193,nowvoyager,This remake was made simply because it could be made,6,8 April 2007,"I disagree with those who make ridiculous claims this is a bad Bond film. It has a good cast and director, and I found it entertaining. It was a remake of Thunderball for a very good reason. The original novel of Thunderball was supposed to have been the first James Bond film in 1962, but Ian Fleming was sued by Kevin McClory for having allegedly stolen some of his original ideas and plot lines from an original screenplay commissioned by Fleming. Fleming dismissed McClory and allegedly used much of his work in the resulting Thunderball novel. If you look at the credits for Thunderball (film #4), you'll notice it is the only one of the ""official"" Bond films to feature McClory's name rather prominently. There was a deal with McClory to have a ten year period from after Thunderball before a remake could be done. As it turned out, Connery was not on good terms with the official Bond franchise due to royalties or some financial disagreement. McClory approached Connery at the right time and that is one of the reasons the film was titled Never Say Never Again. (Connery had said after Diamonds Are Forever that he would never play Bond again). As corporate mergers would have it, this film is now part of the MGM catalog, but will never be given status as an official Bond film. I guess it will always be seen as the bastard of the franchise. None of the official Bond team would work on the film and that is why the familiar theme doesn't appear, the titles, etc, are different. It was also in direct competition with Octopussy which turned out to be a blockbuster. This is no Octopussy, but those who carry on like it was some kind of atrocity take the whole Bond thing too seriously. It's always fun to see Connery as Bond.",Never Say Never Again
194,WinterMuteLabs,NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN SpectRe 007 Mcclory/Connery Back Again!,10,10 January 2004,"Like most people out there who have watched James Bond 007 movies. Most people NEVER knew that Thunderball was originally the FIRST 007 Movie to be released, but after Ian Fleming, wrote the story with kevin mcclory and jack whittingham. The 2 other authors took Ian Fleming to court and WON THE CASE providing evidence that ian fleming took the ideas of SPECTRE(Special Executive In CounterIntelligence Terrorism Revenge Extortion). So rather than making Thunderball they(fleming,broccoli,saltzman) went on to make Dr NO.This movie had the best of the best, From getting sean connery to come back one more time, he was paid over 5,000,000 for NSNA. Irvin Kershner and Sean Connery had problems on the set, that much is true. But overall this movie was up there i think with(Thunderball, Licence To Kill, Dr No) those are my favorite from the bond series. David Dryer was hired for Special Photographic Effects, he was working at the time on Bladerunner beFORE NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN. The 100 million dollar yacht makes the disco volante, look like a canoe. This movie starred the best Villian in a bond movie just behind dr no. Klaus Maria Brandeau held together this neurotic business like calm manner, with a little wit to his authority over bond. Barbara Carrera was excellent as fatima blush.The Music was better than every score that didnt contain John Barry doing the backround score music in most bond films. Michel Legrand is not big in the usa compared to over in europe, he has played with miles davis and many other GREAT jazz musicians over the years. Its a little bland at times but the 007 theme that happens around 3 or 4 times in the Movie NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN IS so Cool, i like it more than the original.007 is back One More TimeTimothy Dalton explained it right i thought, YOU CANT RELATE TO A SUPERMAN OR A SUPERHERO, he or she has to be human and have feelings. He was by far the BEST SERIOUS TRUE TO FLEMINGS VERSION OF BOND.

195,jeffans-1,don't be so sure to call man with the golden gun the worst!,1,24 July 2005,"If I could give this a negative score I would.Where to start? Well first of all, none of the original 007 characters (Desmond Llewelyn, etc etc) were in this movie. We settled for scrub substitutes who cant hold a candle to the original actors. This whole movie was a bunch of nobodies other than Connery and baysinger. Secondly, if you are going to make a bond movie without them, at least give it an original script! We all know what Thunderball is about (and frankly, if you are going to do a remake of a bond movie, you can do a lot better than thunderball!). The villain was absolutely weak. If you try to compare him to zorin, khan, drax, Stromberg, then you are nuts. His henchman (or in this case, henchwoman) carrera was decent but nowhere in the same galaxy as jaws, mayday, or Gobinda. And that cheesy video game they played, that was such a copycat of octopussy where bond played kamal khan in backgammon and surprised the villain in a winner take all match (this movie was both filmed and released after octopussy). I don't even know how bond could have figured out how to play it in 2 minutes.But the worst part of all? After watching this stinker for over 90 minutes, I would pray it would end, that this joke of a movie would end, but it goes on for over 2 hours!!! It's a small wonder octopussy destroyed this at the box office. Octopussy is in my opinion the 2nd best bond movie ever (Connery, Moore, Dalton, brosnan, or anybody else) behind only view to a kill. THis one? Its at the other end of the spectrum, the worst one ever, even worse than Man with golden Gun.Don't waste your time or money on this garbage. Connery should have stuck to his word!!!

196,Saving_Christmas,The Second Best James Bond Movie Ever,10,22 January 2015,"I would say, apart from The Living Daylights (which is the best of the best and can never be replaced), this is still a fantastic film.At the beginning, there is still a superb starting sequence. We know that there will be a tense plot following the stolen nuclear warheads. Also we will expect another tense and nail-biting moment, to see if Bond will successfully get to the end of this mystery and see what will actually be the result.I found a lot of curiosity from the video game scene, not only the fanciness of the gadget but a twisting point with the film's main villain Largo, plus the Bond girl, Domino. Therefore after we see that Largo tried to destroy Bond and Domino together and they make a dramatic escape, we get the feeling that another duel-to-the-death between Bond and the villain will occur at the end.We can now see that Largo's plot was to destroy the oil reserves of the Middle East, and then we follow a sequence of Bond trying to stop this from happening. The end sequence features a very creative resolution, as we see that Domino had killed Largo by using a harpoon gun. Making this film the only one in which the main Bond girl eliminates the main villain.Overall, what a wonderful hit yet again from the best Scottish actor in history. Also, Kim Basinger in my opinion was the very best Bond girl in the entire Bond series. Although their performance combined with KMB's talent still did not match Timmy Dalton and Maryam d'Abo's brilliance, I still believe that this is one heck of a thriller to watch.",Never Say Never Again
197,ryanhunter70,Never Say Never Again ( contains spoilers),8,23 March 2006,"The much talked about NSNA is a unique entry into the Bond series more than it being unofficial its the first ""remake"" Bond, though the producers would loosely remake Goldfinger under the guise of ""A View To A Kill"" and later outright remake ""Casino Royale"".NSNA marks the last film that Connery appears as Bond and his 2nd appearance as Bond since he vowed in 1967 that he would never play Bond again. I'm forced to believe that this outing is for pure fun, and a bit of payback to the producers. By the mid-80's Connery was a world-wide superstar who didn't need the Bond series to produce a hit. He starred in this film just because all the fans demanded his return! Though Moore has held the part for 10 yrs by this point he was only accepted as Bond..Connery is Bond! It's a good film, though not perfect it does contain some of the best action and best lines from any Bond movie. Connery chose to play his Bond as a mature aging agent, much to his benefit(it makes his need to run around and prove himself still useful a subtle sub-plot, and it's bold move as Roger Moore would have you believe he's still 30 yrs old when he clearly was aging.) It's not quite as good as Connery's best bond (his first 4) it's definitely as good as YOLT and better than DAF, and in better shape, this is Connery's most fit in any movie since Thunderball. The movie isn't perfect and does suffer from minor plot holes and less than fantastic score. But what the hell, it's Connery and the locations are as beautiful as are the women, and the sets design hardly ever gets any mention but its vastly superior than anything EON ever constructed during that time period.

If all you Bond purists out there think I'm gonna get controversial, you're right. Bond is one of the greatest movie series ever, but that doesn't mean that a series should go on forever. This, I think, is one of two films where they could've done themselves a huge favour and ended the Bond saga. Not offended yet? Then I'll continue... Hey, if you're thinking I'm indifferent about Bond flicks, you're wrong. I grew up with my Mum being OBSESSED with them. Any spare moment, Bond and his antics would be on the TV. Bond rules, and 'Never Say Never Again' (directed by Irvin 'Empire Strikes Back' Kershner) is one of the best. It may not be 'Goldfinger' or 'From Russia...' and may not have been done by the same production house as all the others (which I hear is why they refuse to accept it was ever made!?), but still stands head and shoulders above the recent Brosnan outings... (if you haven't spat at the screen, read on). CHARACTERIZATION!!!!! Something so many blockbuster films forget about these days, but something which is essential to telling a good story. 'Never' played a superb hand by treating 007 like he had been ageing since 'Dr. No'. He's 'getting on a bit' and so has to do things like go to a health farm - a direct order from 'M' (!). Yeah, if you haven't seen this film, I won't give too much away with the plot because A) Loads happens and B) Obviously, I want YOU to see it for yourselves. Don't be put off by my 'old Bond' revelation, Connery still get plenty of superb set pieces to charge, swim, punch, speed, smash, and snog his way through. The man is a legend, and this film is one of his most enjoyable outings as Bond. High tech gadgets galore, some great villains, and an excellent supporting cast (including a fantastic cameo by Rowan Atkinson) lift this movie high above audience expectation.This could've been the last Bond film ever, and it would've been a party to remember. Playing the secret agent as someone nearing retirement was refreshing stroke of genius - the last scene wraps things up perfectly for the series.... ...but still we had more, and then more, and more still, and one more Moore. Still, if you fancy finding out what ""Fatima Blush"" is all about, get this film. Then you can at least pretend 007 spent his last moments as a wisecracking secret agent, in the arms of Kim Basinger, and smirking at Mr. Bean. (P.S. * That other film that I think could've finished it all off? The gritty 'License to Kill'",Never Say Never Again
201,wrw0101,Cheesy Bond,1,1 February 2009,"This movie is a classic example of what went wrong with the James Bond series. The special effects are so cheesy, the acting is mediocre, the action scenes are so fake, all participants of this movie should have been ashamed of themselves. Perhaps this is what led Sean Connery to decide his pride was worth more than the money he was selling out for. The fight scene in the health spa is laughable without intending to be so. Sean Connery is sleepwalking through this movie. One wonders if he learned his lines or just read them off of cue cards. The first Bond movie set a standard that was never lived up to again. Thank goodness for Daniel Craig.",Never Say Never Again

203,J-Preece_92,Roger who? The other fella is back big time!,7,13 February 2014,"'Never Say Never Again' the remake of Connery's official 1965 flick 'Thunderball.' Connery looks very much a man at ease in this film. He may be 53 but looks lean, fit, slim & tanned. Who cares if his hair is greying? Compared to Roger Moore's 'Octopussy' in the same year 'NSNA' feels more like a genuine Bond flick....slick, tongue-in-cheek humour, a lead actor who doesn't look 70, one of the most gorgeous bond girls ever (Kim Basinger) & decent supporting characters! Nice to have Blofeld back officially after 12 years! Max Von Sydow's Blofeld is on par with Donald Pleasence in 1967's 'You Only Live Twice.' Overall 'Never Say Never Again' is a solid Bond film with the best Bond back at the helm! For die-hard Bond fans its a more pleasing watch than the average 'Octopussy.'",Never Say Never Again
204,birdlawcricket,Never See Again,2,11 February 2013,"When Sean Connery left the Bond franchise after ""You Only Live Twice"" he was afraid of being type-casted as James Bond. He returned for ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and his demanding salary (which was unheard of at the time) forced Eon to cutback on special effects, making it a relatively weak movie.Connery left once again and went off to try and write his own Bond movies with Kevin McClory (Co-Writer of ""Thunderball"") but United Artist put a stop to that through legal battles. ""Never Say Never Again"" was the product of an early battle between Eon Productions and McClory. McClory would be allowed to make his own version ten years after the release of ""Thunderball"" and Connery, who didn't want to be type-casted as 007, came back to play 007 in this movie.After watching ""Never Say Never Again,"" I can see why Eon had a dispute with Kevin McClory. The script is weak and choppy, making for a ""Quantum of Solace"" style flow to the movie. The less than exciting fight at the beginning is almost a disgrace to Connery's official Bond movies. Also, the quirky styling of Mr. Bean look alike Nigel, makes the movie more comical than the Roger Moore movies, which also detracted from the Bond franchise.This movie is on par with the worst of the Brosnan Movies. ""Die Another Day"" specifically and is better off forgotten. The stunts are just as ridiculous and the plot is a bit forced with characters being introduced in the most ridiculous ways (i.e. jet skiing off the water and into Bond's arms.)Perhaps it's because, having read the Bond novels, I find Daniel Craig to be the most accurate Bond, with Dalton and Lazenby close behind. You can get by without seeing ""Never Say Never Again.""",Never Say Never Again
205,clcdan-clc,Legrand isn't as grand as I'd expect,5,2 September 2013,"M. Legrand, no doubt, in 1983 was something of a film phenom, and had a string of disco hits as well (probably why he was pegged as ""The guy"" for the job) but with Bond scores, you MUST stick to the formula as much as possible. This particular film - especially in action sequences - were underscored, in my opinion, so far away from any Bond film prior, or since (David Arnold may not even have been born yet) made me cringe, in the theatrical release, and still today, on any screen. It just makes me laugh - not too mention, during the underwater sequences, the orchestra brass is so out of tune (I at first rationalized maybe that wavering sound was added to the mix on purpose to sound underwatery? It's that bad, check it)Not ALL of the Legrand offerings are bad - the love scenes, the bar band music, the casino entre act (with that fantastically evil shocking game!), the dance room source music, those are pure French Legrand and actually fun to listen to out of context. But, that's just it, a most amazing stamp of all good Bond film scores (and I dare add any good film score) is that every song should be enjoyable out of film context. Lovers of film scores know what I mean.This film score, for the most part, reminds me of the ""odd job"" Roger Moore did to the Bond. Just too campy and wavering from the form.Klaus' villain is supreme, his acting perfect. Not campy, very menacing. At least the director allowed him, and Connery, to stick to that Bond formula! Fatima was a little over the top, but if she was playing psychotic, then bravo on that! Too bad the producers couldn't have attempted a similar binding agreement with the idea of Legrand (as I do not wish him harm, of course), that idea needed to be attacked on all fronts.",Never Say Never Again
206,canuco,"Sean ""Bond"" Connery returns one last time and triumphs.",7,13 March 2005,"Connery returns to his previous role of 007 with that usual flair of his. Those familiar with the Bond series will easily make out this film as a re-hash of Thunderball. Domino, Blofeld, the nuclear bombs, etc. etc. are all here minus the famous Bond music. This does not take away from the film in any way. Connery is a bit older but as Bond, still lethal and always charming. Bond is called upon one last time to help in the fight against his old nemesis, Spectre. He reluctantly agrees to return to Nassau, The Bahamas and is pointed in the direction of, Fatima Blush. She promptly bumps into Bond while water skiing and quips, ""Oh, how reckless of me. I made you all wet."" Bond, never one to miss out on a chance for a comeback casually replies, ""Yes, but my Martini is still dry"". Connery worked this film very well and gave a good accounting of himself in his last role as the Bristish agent with the license to kill.Naturally Blofeld and his minions get what's coming to 'em. Take this DVD for a spin and watch classic 007 at work. Highly recommended.",Never Say Never Again
207,mark-1644,The kitsch is losing its flavour in this Bond film,2,15 April 2005,"Somehow this film does not have the same excitement factor as most of the other early Bond movies. It's decidedly lukewarm, with one of the most dull and boring climaxes of any film. Even the enduring cheeky kitsch factor is wearing a bit thin somehow. All the ingredients are there for a classic Bond - dry martini (shaken not stirred), an amusingly named girl villain (Fatima Blush), great locations and an evil arch-enemy, but it doesn't quite gel somehow. A half-hearted attempt to amuse by including a bumbling secret agent in the form of Rowan Atkinson does not help matters, only serving to downgrade the film further. Sean Connery is a star as always, but I think it's best that he was superseded after such a long time by the excellent and refreshing Timothy Dalton. The other 2 stars of this show are the gorgeous Kim Basinger and Blofeld's cat.",Never Say Never Again
208,kendue,A Bond film for true Bond fans!,10,6 November 2019,"If you love the original Ian Fleming books and Sean Connery's portrayal of 007 as masculine, confident, alpha male, then you will love this movie. The story behind it's creation is interesting, as it was not one of the Albert Broccoli-produced Bond films. Thunderball collaborator Kevin McClory had screen rights and drove the production of this film which was released when Roger Moore was the official James Bond.Sean Connery was 50 years old when the movie was made, and still in great shape, perhaps even looking better than he did in the 1971 Bond film Diamonds Are Forever. An athletic Connery did many of his own stunts.Others have covered the plot in detail, so I won't waste time on rehashing it.",Never Say Never Again
209,jtmspam,Excellent film for what it set out to accomplish,9,3 September 2005,"I must say, that when I saw this movie I was quite impressed. I had just finished reading the entire series of Ian Flemming's novels. I was in the middle of watching the Bond films in order on AMC. I had been watching the movies to see their accuracy in regards to the book. Having read them, it was quite interesting to see the differances, but I digress. This movie is based off the book 'Thunderball'. I must say that this movie more accurately portrays the book than the movie Thunderball. Of course there were details thrown in to make it fit the movie better with the times. The whole presidential recognition allowing the release of nuclear weapons wasn't around at the time of the books release. But the characters, the way they were portrayed and the locations for 90% represent the book splendedly. I only wish that they filmed this in place of the original 'Thunderball'!",Never Say Never Again
210,imdb-10650,Trivia: Will the real goof please stand up?,6,3 December 2005,"Before I give my comments on the film, I would like to correct another review; the author wrote..""A goof. - Rowan Atkinson's character states that he is from the British Embassy in Nassau. As, however, the Bahamas is a Commonwealth country, Britain would have a High Commission in its capital, not an Embassy"".Speaking of goofs, I think that statement is the 'real goof'! Having been born and raised in Nassau {great}, I know in 1970, there was significant political upheaval and moves started immediately to break ties with Britain.Although that was the year I left Nassau seeking a 'slightly' larger island, ending up in Australia (80sq miles vs about five million). Anyhow, from memory, in the mid to late 70's, Nassau ceased to be a British Commonwealth and therefore in 1983, when the movie was made, there would have been a British Embassy.Ps. I can truly see Rowan Atkinson as the typical British Embassy envoy at that time. Certainly robbed of an Oscar for casting.Sadly, the movie only rates a 5/10 with me. I give it 2 for having the 'real' James Bond, 1 for a touch of Nassau nostalgia, and 2 for Atkinson's performance - the rest being for script originality, special effects etc - you do the math.",Never Say Never Again
211,wez4,"Nobody does it better, but this could've been better!",7,13 December 2010,"OK, so it was never going to be better than Octopussy (released in the same year) but I reckon they made a decent stab at the Bond formula. That said I thought after a strong opening in which Bond battles baddies in the jungle, the film sort of limps along a bit with little action until the ""Domination"" video game scene. Then things begin to speed up a bit with the brilliant motorcycle chase through the back streets of Monte Carlo.Sean Connery keeps things ticking over effortlessly though with his usual blend of charm and good humour, coupled with two excellent baddies in the shape of Klaus Maria Brandauer as Largo and Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush. It's these two characters which steal the show for me. Brandauer's Largo is a charming yet sinister character who looks respectable one minute then psychotic the next! Sadly, as a bond girl Kim Basinger struggles, serving as little more than eye candy most of the time. This was a big disappointment to me as I thought an actress of her calibre would put in a more credible performance. But I suppose if it's not on the page you can't do it! The biggest problem though are the large gaping holes in the plot which make it hard to really believe in the film. A few examples include the excellent fight scene between Bond and the always brilliant former British wrestler Pat Roach (the only man to have beaten up both James Bond & Indiana Jones!!!) Despite almost being killed, no investigation is launched by MI5 into why Bond was attacked or what it was he saw as he spied on Jack Petachi and Fatima Blush. The whole incident is simply forgotten.When Bond boards Largo's yacht by swimming up into it's hull, Largo dosen't even enquire as to why Bond was sniffing around his boat in scuba gear merely commenting that he is ""a bit early for lunch"". Thereafter, the whole incident is again just forgotten about! Maybe I'm just picking holes but there are an awful lot of holes to pick!!! All in all, its an enjoyable romp which gets very silly at times. It was a good start, then a bit slow, picked up in the middle and for me a bit of a weak ending, but still fun nonetheless!",Never Say Never Again
212,bruder_felix,"Remake of Thunderball, not as good, but still fun",5,10 January 2006,"I noticed it was a remake while watching a Bond film festival on AMC. I remember seeing Thunderball in the theater as a child. We had the theme song on a 45rpm record at home. If I recall the flip side of that Tom Jones hit was entitled Key to My Heart.Overall it was an entertaining movie but I question why Irv Kershner & Co felt the villains needed to sport German accents. I'm mean, come on, Emile Largo is hardly a Germanic moniker. Maybe Irv plays bridge with Spielberg.I happened to see the enhanced version of Thunderball, which includes a running commentary at the bottom of the screen. It seems the Bond character, in Ian Fleming's mind, would have been closer to his thinking had it been Roger Moore (The Saint), Patrick Mcgoohan (Secret Agent Man), or Cary Grant (pick a movie). Ironically, while this movie was being released Roger Moore had taken over the Bond role and was starring in Octopussy.",Never Say Never Again
213,sspinella-78579,Good movie. Horrible score.,7,3 November 2018,There are a lot of things to enjoy in this movie. Yes it is Thunderball Redux but with many new twists. I especially like the fact that there are few things that there are a few things that are almost a preview to future Bond movies. There is a new M who views the Double O's as being dinosaurs. This is the same as Judi Dench in Goldeneye.The one thing that I cannot take is the score. It is horrible! This is an action movie not a French New Wave movie. I wish I could rerecord the score.,Never Say Never Again
