0,SnoopyStyle,some surprising fun,6,16 November 2019,"Dora lives with her parents (Eva Longoria, Michael Peña) in the jungle as they search for the lost Incan city of Parapata. She's a six year old with her backpack, map, monkey friend Boots, and cousin Diego while fending off the swiping fox Swiper. Ten years later, her parents send her to L.A. to live with her cousin Diego's family and socialize with regular kids. She is a fish out of water. Diego is embarrassed to be around her. Randy is the school nerd. Sammy is the hated overachiever. During a museum trip, the four outsiders are forced to be in a group. Treasure hunters kidnap Dora along with the three others and transport them back to the jungle. They plan to trade Dora to her parents for the lost city and its treasures. The kids are rescued by Alejandro who claims to be a friend of Dora's parents.I'm not expecting much from this movie. For the IP, I expected a kids movie with kids. I still think six year old Dora and Diego could have some great adventures in the jungle as a family film. It's the way I would want for a Dora movie. From the trailer, the movie sets out with a teenager Dora. It would have been more interesting for her to explore the concrete jungle. So, the movie is going a third way. It has its funny moments. Dora's unrelenting cheerfulness is awkwardly funny in a couple of scenes. The four kids have some good chemistry. This is fine but I don't see it expanding into a bigger franchise. It has no chance of being the next Harry Potter. I doubt that this one can generate a sequel.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
1,nogodnomasters,"Can you say ""perfecto""?",10,31 August 2019,"Dora and her high school friends are on a rescue mission of her parents and looking for the Lost City of Gold. At times it was a nice combination of ""The Last Crusade"" and ""National Treasure."" The characters were delightful and comical. It included Dora's asides, which was questioned by people around her. Great entertainment for the entire family. A film adults will enjoy watching with their children. I was impressed with the historical reference to the ""United Fruit Company.""",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
2,paul_haakonsen,Surprisingly good and entertaining...,6,5 November 2019,"Well, I had a vague idea about whom Dora the Explorer was from a few glances on the TV when my son have been flipping through the children shows. So I sat down to watch this 2019 live action rendering of Dora the Explorer with my 9 year old son.Turns out that the movie was actually better than I had expected to be. I had expected this to be a children's movie, but it is actually a family movie, because there is something even for parents and adults to enjoy in the movie. So whatever beforehand assumptions I had about what I was in for was definitely put to rest at the hands of director James Bobin.Think about this as being sort of a light-hearted Indiana Jones adventure for the children and the family, and just take out the Nazis from the equation. Actually, the storyline in ""Dora and the Lost City of Gold"" was actually rather enjoyable, and the story was captivating and the good pacing of the story made it a very entertaining movie to sit through.They had a good ensemble of actors and actresses to portray the various roles, and Isabela Moner, playing Dora, really carried the movie quite well. It was sort of fun to realize that it was Benicio Del Toro whom voiced Swiper and Danny Trejo that voiced Boots. And they also had the likes of Michael Peña and Temuera Morrison in the movie as well.I was more than genuinely entertained and surprised with this movie, and it was definitely well worth sitting down with my son to watch. My rating of the 2019 ""Dora and the Lost City of Gold"" movie is a six out of ten stars.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
3,oscaralbert,"In theaters the same month that ""the World's lungs"" are burning up . . .",7,24 August 2019,". . . DORA AND THE LOST CITY OF GOLD displays a remarkable lack of environmental awareness. (To the camera: ""Can you say 'I'm just in it for the money'?) ""Dora's"" story begins in the Amazon Rain Forest, most of which lies in a failed nation-state commonly referred to as ""Brazil."" To understand this horrid hovel of a homeland, just imagine an over-populated swamp in which the majority of voters mimic the deplorable basket of USA ""Red Statesmen."" Furthermore, imagine that these malingering miscreants elect an Arsonist-in-Chief who orders Earth's main oxygen production facility to be torched and burned to a crisp, wiping out the Seven Lost Tribes of Brazil, along with 47% of the planet's genetic diversity. (To the camera: ""Who gives a carp about the Real World?"") DORA AND THE LOST CITY OF GOLD is a not-so-funny spoof of this South American Armageddon. IF Dora had an ounce of gumption, she'd get on the stick and take out her neighborhood bully before he can entirely make good on his credible threat to Humanity's survival. Instead, she stumbles around in a daze, warbling songs about maps, backpacks, and carp holes for ""Going #2.""",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
4,neil-476,Great fun with a stellar title performance,9,25 August 2019,"Dora lives with her parents (and a very obviously CGI monkey) in the Peruvian rain forest, and wants to be an explorer like them when she grows up. But her parents send her to high school in the USA when she is in her teens as they think she needs to learn to socialise. Yet maybe the jungle is closer than she fears.My kids are in their 30s - I never saw the animated TV show which is the jumping off point for this live action family movie. But there are so many nods to it that I'm pretty sure it wouldn't surprise me to see it. However, I did see this movie, in which 15-year old Dora is smart, resourceful, and ready to burst into appropriate but pretty awful songs at the drop of a hat (I must make it clear that the awfulness is deliberate and usually quite funny).The film achieves a clever balancing act. For those to whom the TV series is a treasured part of childhood, it is honoured and respected. For those who haven't seen it, we are looking at a (very) junior level Indiana Jones adventure with a likeable ensemble, some excitement, and a lot of humour. I saw it in a small auditorium with about two dozen in the audience: there were places where the kids laughed, places where the adults laughed, and places where everyone laughed.15-year old Dora is played by Isabel Moner, now just turned 18. This is the 4th film I have seen her in, and the first she has headlined. Playing a relentlessly positive character who is essentially a real-life cartoon, and who could so easily be irritating, she gives us a Dora who is immensely likeable. Much of this, I suspect, comes from Miss Moner herself, who impresses me more with every film I see her in.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
5,ericstevenson,It certainly looked awful,8,14 June 2020,"This movie is based on the immensely popular ""Dora The Explorer"" cartoon and its cartoon is one of the most hated cartoons ever made. It still set a record for biggest improvement from a TV show! It's amazing how something as beloved as ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" can be made into one of the most hated films of all time, but this cartoon is made into something so good! Okay, it's not great but definitely good. There was a parody of this years before it was even made! The best part is that they don't take themselves seriously.While it's still a film worth seeing, I definitely think it went on too long. The pacing could have been better, especially how it went from young to old to High School to the jungle again. Still, it's got a great sense of humor and Dora is a very likeable character as are really all the characters. It's mostly played for laughs. Since when did live-action adaptations get so good?! They used to be some of the worst movies ever made! ***",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
6,cricketbat,Much more amusing than any episode of Dora the Explorer,7,19 September 2020,"Considering this movie is based on an educational children's cartoon, Dora and the Lost City of Gold is better than it has any right to be. It's much more amusing than any episode of Dora the Explorer. Isabela Moner is infectiously perky and it's obvious that she's enjoying her role. There are some absurd moments in this movie, but overall, it's an entertaining, self-depreciating ride for kids and adults.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
7,tabuno,An Enjoyable and Decent Youthful Movie,8,30 December 2019,"This adaptation of the popular cartoon series brings to the big screen an upbeat and lavish story that is bubbly, optimistic with a good message in this entertaining comedic adventure. The central character of Dora is infectious and inviting with her authentic and valuable intelligent naivety. Her ability to make friends and her ability to both physically and mentally bore through obstacles instills hope and encouragement as a model to younger audiences. This is a decent and fun movie, sort of a Mr. Rogers in the wild.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
8,UniqueParticle,I cant believe I saw this and enjoyed it,7,6 September 2019,"I was the only one in the theater which helped a lot, I'd be embarrassed to see this around others especially being 27 years old. There's quite a lot of dumb moments and heartwarming scenes too; luckily this only cost me 53 cents because of my Regal Unlimited subscription. Also an odd thing I've noticed is the actress who played Dora has really gone through puberty and yet she doesn't seem mature that's really the only problem I had. Is it so wrong to be innocent? I don't know anymore.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
9,John6Daniels,Kiddie version of tomb raider,1,14 August 2019,"Yes it's the kiddie version of Tomb Raider.How this movie even made pass 500,000 (It made over 19 million) at the box office shows us why there are still very bad-dumb movies being made like Dora and the Lion King 2019.90s children movies had more heart, dept, fun, security, story and realism. Today just add bad jokes and violent PG gags and you got yourself a movie.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
10,cruise01,The animated beloved Dora is brought to life which fans will love while the rest may not.,5,10 August 2019,"Dora and the Lost City of Gold (2.5 out of 5 stars).Dora and the Explorer fans of the animated series will definitely love the live action movie with its cute, charming direction of Dora being energetic and positive about every single thing. She even narrates with certain words asking the audience if they can say some word. Or she talks to every object and animal. Plus fans of the series will also get to see a teenage Diego, Boots the Monkey, and Swiper the Fox. Isabela Moner is cute and charming playing Dora. She is perfect for the role.Fans and kids will love the movie. However, the movie overall is a bit too much. The direction, script, and acting are cheesy to see it in live action. The opening scene does open up with Dora's theme song which I have not heard in years since the cartoon series. Showing Dora and Diego as kids and exploring through the jungle. Diego has to go back to his parents and live in the city. While Dora and her family live in the jungle. Years Later, her parents played by Michael Pena and Eva Longoria discover a clue about a lost civilization. Which they want to explore alone and send Dora off to the city to live with Diego and his family. It was fun to see Dora trying to adjust to the city life. Going to high school. Always saying hello to everyone which they ignore. Her cousin Diego is embarrassed to be around her. When they go on a school field trip. A group of treasure hunting thieves kidnap Dora and her friends Diego, and two others. They get rescued by Alejandro (Eugenio Derbez) and go on their own to discover the lost civilization before the thieves do.The direction is awkwardly cheesy. The script is filled with cheesy dialogue that the target audience is only for kids. Kids will enjoy. Adults may not. The acting is awkward. Isabela Moner is great as the character. The acting with everyone else is just cringing awkward and not as funny. Eugenio Derbez tries to be the comic relief but looks terrible when its on screen. The visual effects is terrible. The cgi Boots looks terrible. Swiper looks even worse. The plot is bare minimum boring. They go out looking for a lost civilization. And when they do come across them. They are shown for a brief moment until the lost city is collapsing and self destructing. Cause the characters accidently set off a trap.Overall, Dora and the Lost City of Gold is a pretty bad film. The concept could have been fun and great if the story was properly developed, it had a better direction and script. Isabela Moner delivered great as the character being awkwardly positive and fun.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
11,pmtelefon,A lot of fun,8,27 February 2021,"I've seen parts of ""Dora the Explorer"" the tv show a bunch of times. My daughters used to watch it all of the time. I was actually more excited than they were when ""Dora and the Lost City of Gold"" came out. I watched it this morning and the movie didn't disappoint. It's a lot of fun. The cast is very good. The jokes are funny. The story is good and often exciting. There is one sequence that doesn't really work and the movie does run out of gas a little towards the end but it doesn't really matter. There is so much goodwill built up by then there is no need to nitpick. ""Dora and the Lost City of Gold"" is an easy watch and I plan on watching it again real soon. Honorable mention: Boots.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
12,digitalbeachbum,I tried to watch it,2,28 August 2020,"I watched Dora the animated series with the kids, but this movie was unbearable. It was definitely made for the immature and the mentality of children. As I watched the first few minutes I fast forward to the grown up Dora, but it didn't get any better. I then skipped around trying to find something interesting, but nothing seemed to work. It was boring, childish and lacking.I will admit, there were some minor moments, like ""can you say neural toxicity"" which I chuckled briefly but was quickly back in reality when the movie proceeded back in to the stages of stupidity. However, that wasn't enough to keep me interested and I didn't care of Dora discovered a city made of gold or if she learned she was bi-sexual. The movie sucked. I couldn't watch anymore of it.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
13,matthewssilverhammer,So...yeah...the Dora movie is good. Go figure.,7,15 March 2020,"A children's film that's like a mash-up of The Brady Bunch Movie and Indiana Jones, and I'm TOTALLY here for it. The humor is certainly much better than the adventure plot, but the humor is so effective and weird, it's impossible to dislike. Merced is an immediate star, giving an undeniably winning performance that's as convincingly sincere as it is funny, while Pena and Longoria steal every scene they're in.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
14,arfdawg-1,Wow. BAD!,1,28 December 2019,The worst TV on earth is now the worst movie ever made.Dora the explorer was hands down the worst children's TV show ever made.

However when she goes on a school tour with her friends she ends up being kidnapped by people who are after her parents as they are after the treasure. Will Dora get the treasure and save the day. Overall the humour was great,the action was great and it's a really great flick. This is coming from a grown up woman who didn't grow up with the animated show as a kid yet enjoyed the film adaptation.I'm giving it a B",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
16,subxerogravity,Thought it was good. Can't help but to think it could have been better.,7,9 October 2019,"So never seen the show. One good thing about the fact that they aged the kid to be a teenager is that I only needed to be aware of the premise of Dora without having actually needed to see the show.
With that said, it gets a lot of cute points. You can't help but to like it. My fav part is Eugenio Derbez who is just too funny. Got some good laughs out of it. It could have been a more exciting adventure. They had a chance to make somewhat a Goonies for this generation but the plan is not filled out.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
17,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Dora and the Lost City of Gold,4,8 January 2020,4/10 - a strong start quickly derails to a boring and tedious adventure that should have stayed on the small screen,Dora and the Lost City of Gold
18,henry8-3,Dora and the Lost City of Gold,5,26 June 2020,"Based on the popular kids cartoon, this is a kiddie version of Indiana Jones etc with Dora and her pals going to help out her parents in their search for a city of gold.Well made fun and adults will certainly enjoy this, but really this one is for kids.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
19,kwenchow,Another worst movie of the year! Not intense and too many overuse annoying singing scene! Bored to freaking death!,1,11 November 2019,"This film start with an article saying ""this film is a true story, except fox don't swipe"", the introduction of ""Dora"" and her cousin ""Diego"", ten years later, they meet again, and they kidnap by several unknown people scene! As turnout, this film is about a man ""Alejandro"" disguise as a rescuer to rescue Dora, but actually his intention is using Dora's expertise to help him find the gold! Entire film not intense at all! Overuse of the song sing by Dora! Super freaking bored! The post credit dancing and singing scene also make audience felt asleep and annoying! Barely laughable scene is, a fox try to steal the map from Dora and it's head stick in a box! At the end, Dora choose the water instead of the gold and place the artifact statue on the right position to save her friends and her parent! Still have one boring dancing and singing scene after the credit! That's it! A boring adventure film! Not recommended!",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
20,aidanratesmovies,"Not terrible, but an unoriginal and annoying adaptation",5,23 December 2019,"Although the film does prove to be better than expected, Dora lacks anything defining that could shape the mess and range of people it seems to be trying to appeal. The film is mediocrely acted and quite painfully written at times, making for some wild twists that not only do not make any sense, but so many that it just becomes painfully obvious how little effort was put into the film. The dialogue can also seem really forced and stereotypical, with a few decent one liners throughout, but for the most part the film seems painfully written by adults trying to recognize teenage life. The film's style seems like a situational comedy and adventure from the 80's, almost like a modern day kid friendly version of Crocodile Dundee which may seem enjoyable to some, but is mainly played out and quite silly to follow, and not in a good way. In the end, Dora isn't anything more than you expect it to be. It can be decently entertaining and even mildly humorous at times, but its flaws take the better of it. In the end, Dora is not nearly as terrible as it could be, but it is far from a success, lacking any originality and providing a forced teen adventure story that seems like an expensive made for TV film.
My Rating: 5/10",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
21,RatedVforVinny,It works to a certain degree but fails to ignite.,4,18 May 2020,"I know nothing of the comic that this is based on but judging mostly of what my 10 year old boy said about this one, I can't really recommend it. Obviously the target audience must be below the age of 14 but i usually find a lot more merit in children's movies than this one delivers. The lead child actor is fairly decent and the special effects are certainly above average but again according to my young son (and i would totally agree) the rest of the early teen cast, are all pretty cringe worthy (and shame they not come to a sticky end), so resting on a score of four.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
22,doomedmac,"The myth, the meme, the legend...",7,7 August 2020,"I really want Dora and the Lost City of Gold to go down as a cult classic; a legendary meme movie. The script is cringe and awkward as frick, but it's a ton of fun.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
23,rgkarim,"Can you Say, Fun, Family Friendly Adventure?",7,9 August 2019,"Childhood television shows hold a special place in our hearts, bringing us back to the days where adventure lied in every episode. Eager minds waited for the next episode to come, fooling ourselves that something different was going to happen to our hero and push them to the edge, only until we realized it was predictably the same ending. So movies that come out to potentially extend a hand back into the past and relive those moments are very intriguing and we may just find ourselves flocking to the movies to figure out what they writers could have in store for our heroes. Well, today that movie trend tries once more, this time in a pop culture icon who had mixed reception depending on the age you started with her.

PreachySummary:For a movie that is based on a kid's program, the Nickelodeon studies managed to keep the kid-friendly atmosphere alive and appropriate for the younger audience members. Utilizing the young adult morale issues for the generation to latch onto and have a rapport with. Those who aren't looking for the preteen dilemmas and high school shenanigans though will enjoy the humor in this film. The director and writers knew that the older population would be looking for something more enjoyable and the movie hits that mark by making fun of itself and trying to rationalize how Dora had the adventures she did. It's this self-punching humor that had me laughing up a storm and if you get the references remain into the movie at what next piece of humor you would get. And for fans like me who had younger relatives obsessed with the explorer, you pick up a few references that bring back the nostalgia of the animated adventures and the ridiculousness at hand. As for Boots, the little monkey is adorable and funny, bringing a dynamic set of jokes to the mix and relieving some of the other plot devices.Yet the movie fails on the story aspect, working too hard to hit itself with the absurdity of the whole story. The adventure is predictable with lots of obvious foreshadowing laid out in the first third of the act. Trekking through the jungle lacks the bite Indiana jones and others had, again diluting to simplistic sequences that were perfect for the little kids it targets. The end of the path holds a rather disappointing, lackluster finale that leaves much to be desired in terms of wow factor, though it manages to nail that morale heavy lessons we all want in a Nickelodeon themed movie. Much of the disappointment for me was the underutilized cast, many of Dora's friends, rivals, and even other characters like Swiper were overshadowed by the fabulous explorer and her can do attitude. In doing so, the supposedly threatening group to antagonize the trip were one-dimensional throw away that served mainly to give slight suspense to the film. Yet, there was still plenty of time for them film to put those preachy lessons right at the end, with music, forced dialogue, and everything else to the delight of families.Dora's real-life adventure is a cute dive to help bridge a lot of audience members. I concur with the rest of the reviewers that it is better than you expect, primarily in the humor, pacing, and fun references that are all contained in the short 100 minutes run-time. Sadly, the humor and kid friendly atmosphere left much to be desired in the form of story, acting, suspense, and overall finale for the adventure. I applaud them for making this thing short and fun though, and would say that this is a decent family film if you are looking for one to close the summer on. Yet, if you need a more quality film overall, look elsewhere, as there are several other films that will assist your viewing pleasures.My scores are:Adventure/Family: 7.0
Movie Overall: 5.0",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
24,Kamurai25,"""Dora of the Jungle""",7,3 August 2020,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.There are a lot of confusing aspects to this movie that definitely hurt it, but it starts high enough each time, you just kind of personally pause and then the movie continues as if it wasn't a thing.The only thing that persists as a problem of casting beautiful adults in the role of children (I just kept going, they don't look like kids), and while I don't remember how much time passes until Dora goes to American high school, it can't be senior year because they have another year after the movie.I'm pretty sure College Humor covered this joke/problem when they had Ariel Winter (""Modern Family"") as Dora and she was 15, but maybe that was the point: yeesh, what a minefield to navigate.The movie is very well produced, the story is actually well written, and at one point I had the thought that this could have been an Indiana Jones plot with some expected tweaks.There are a few things that just break the experience, and I don't just mean all the cringe moments when you put jungle girl into high school.She's literally insane, they address it multiple times in the movie, and it's the opening scene. Fortunately she's such a likeable character that you forget, until it's convenient to remind you.The animals: spoiler or not, the crazy cg animals really mess with your suspension of disbelief and bring you out of the movie: there is literally a plot armor moment where they just make the solution ""an animal does something impossible"". And they talk about it, there are multiple discussions about these animals doing impossible things.It really is a good movie, and I think it is designed the way it is to be family friendly. Worth taking the time to watch.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
25,nancyldraper,Two perspectives,7,13 August 2019,"For this review I will defer to my intrepid AAC*, 9 year old, Sophie. She liked the whole movie and didn't think it had any boring spots. Her favourite part was when they all turned into cartoons. She was not surprised by the twist and felt there might be some good in the bad guy. She gave the movie a 9 (not perfect, but really good) out of 10.
*AAC = age appropriate criticIn my opinion, the movie was enjoyable but had some parts that lagged. I'm always concerned when parents are portrayed as clueless and silly, but the young audience found those points very funny. The acting was good. It was probably a good homage to the TV series. I give the movie a 7 (good) our of 10. {Family Friendly Action Adventure}",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
26,Abdulxoxo,Surprisingly enjoyable,7,29 January 2021,"The film begins with Dora as a 6 year old girl, playing make believe with her cousin Diego. Dora grow up a few years and is sent to stay with her cousin in LA while her parents go off exploring. The film quickly becomes a fish out of water comedy, as we see Dora going to an American high school for the first time. She enthusiastically, but naively, tries to make friends and generally survive such a socially fragile environment. Her character was clearly awkward around other kids, but her constant positivity was endearing. Her likability would remain throughout the entire movie, even if the film itself did lose me at times when the story returned to the jungle. As the adventure section of the film began I thought it was fun, without always holding my attention. At various points I felt as though it's a combination of 'Indiana Jones', 'Tomb Raider' and 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle'. There were some interesting things for Dora and her friends to experience, but I never felt like anything bad was going to happen to these kids, despite the dangerous situations they found themselves in. The villains were quite weak and forgettable, which is always disappointing when that happens. There are also a couple of pretty average-looking CGI.
On the whole, Dora and the lost city of gold is well- paced movie, it's consistently funny and Isabela Moner gives a great performance as the titular character.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

28,kevin c,We DID it,7,29 September 2019,"Movie morning with Gertie.The Nickelodeon star and my daughter's childhood favourite wasn't an obvious candidate for a live-action movie. But it's here and more surprisingly, it's pretty good.Dora is believable as a character because Moner makes her so. As in the recent Instant Family, she's a real star. Her performance sustains the whole film, achieving the balancing act of combining silliness with genuine emotion.There are plenty of clever, funny nods to the animated TV origins. Dora's backpack and map make clever appearances. And overlaid with a fun Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider yomp. It's not perfect - Swiper the Fox is awkwardly crammed in and a bit Scrappy Doo.

31,rockman182,Dora and the Lost City of Gold (2019),6,9 August 2019,"Before seeing the trailer, it kind of slipped my mind that they could ever make a live action Dora The Explorer film. Lo and behold it is here and real. A part of me wondered why I wanted to see this but against judgment I went ahead and watched it. What I watched was actually good and funny in doses but has moments and creative decisions that don't work, however it'll do what it needs to do to please the younger crowd or fans of the series.The film is about Dora The Explorer, only she moves to the city and goes to high school. Adjusting is hard though she tries to be herself. Eventually she and her class mates find themselves captured by criminals who are looking to steal gold from the lost city of gold. Dora and company must find her parents and find a way to escape the crooks while also exploring the wonders that come with natural adventure.The first thing that I quite disliked was the CG effects to create Boots and Swiper. They don't blend in with the film at all and having Swiper be animatronic just didn't mesh well with the film. The film gets pretty ridiculous and unrealistic with its magical elements so it became an afterthought soon after. I guess the thing I liked most about this effort is the fact that it is very self aware and pokes fun at many of the silly elements of the show, like the random singing and talking vocabulary at the camera.The end product is a fairly funny but completely manufactured kids film adventure that does not bring much that is new to the table. It'll do its job in entertaining the younger audience and isn't too much of a chore to watch. I guess its a decent ""turn your brain off if you are an adult"" film that works mostly because of its self aware humor and the committed performance by Isabela Moner.6.5/10",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

But unlike Blues Clues that had very mundane and general mysteries, Dora the Explorer at least tried to add a little more education with zoology and a main character that was Latina. I merely saw it as harmless while Nickelodeon saw it as money.In the age where reboots and remakes are all the rage, it makes sense Hollywood would want to tap into the nostalgia of Dora before it was too late. When a movie was announced, I kept wondering how that would be done as movies based off a little kid aimed material rarely sells. Just as the people who've made movies off of Sesame Street and Thomas the Tank Engine. But Dora and the Lost City of Gold tries something different; it tries to be funny.Young teenager Dora (played by Isabela Moner) may be grown up, but still loves exploring the South American jungle with her monkey Boots (played by Danny Trejo), singing songs to herself and keeping an upbeat sprit about her life. After a fall, her parents Cole (played by Michael Peña) and Elena (played by Eva Longoria) decide that she needs to be around kids her own age and send her to Los Angeles to go live with her cousin Diego (played by Jeff Wahlberg).When going to Diego's high school, she finds her jungle skills and knowledge out of place in a culture of cliques and teenage angst. Nevertheless, she continues to be herself while trying to get back her friendship she used to have with Diego. The both of them are on a fieldtrip when they and two other students get kidnapped by treasure hunters who hope Dora can lead them to her parents who are searching for a lost city of gold. Their sent back to South America, but get away thanks to a fellow explorer Alejandro (played by Eugenio Derbez). Even with an adult, it's up to Dora to lead her friends into the jungle the find her parents and perhaps a lost city of gold.I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually liked Dora and the Lost City of Gold. Not only was it genuinely funny, but it kept my interest in a story that seems like a safer version of Goonies. Is it as good as the latter? No, in fact there are moments that are too dumb, but for the most part, this is a movie that knows what it is and wants to be: a silly adventure. There's nothing wrong with being silly.This is a movie that's made for fans of Dora the Explorer, but it's also for those that made fun of it. It's aware of how annoying the cartoon was for the adults who had to listen to it when their toddlers watched it. A lot of it works thanks to Isabela Moner, who remains as committed as hell to not only making her work as a likable character, but one who can be a literal live-action cartoon.While I had fun, I know that regular adult are not going to get into this at all if they don't have some nostalgia with the character. What does hurt it is while it tries to evolve Dora and her adventure, it still succumbs to cliché family movie parts like the annoying geek character and bathroom jokes. I understand it's a film that still has to appeal to children, but if movies like Inside Out and Up have shown anything, the story can still be great without having to go for lowbrow humor. A part of me also realizes that if I was around ten, I would have dug this movie and maybe even asked my parents to take me to it again.I'll give this seven Doras out of ten. Again, even though I liked it and had fun with it's meta jokes, this is not meant for adults unless they have some nostalgia or even at least some interest. It weird to think that the CGI Lion King remake was bad while a live action Dora the Explorer was better then expected. I suppose it's earned the right to sing ""We did it""",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

35,Anurag-Shetty,Fun for the whole family.,8,14 August 2019,"Dora and the Lost City of Gold is based on the cartoon TV show, Dora the Explorer(2000-2019). Dora(Isabela Moner), is now a teenager. Dora takes her high school classmates, Diego(Jeff Wahlberg), Sammy(Madeleine Madden) & Randy(Nicholas Coombe), on an adventure, to find her missing parents & explore & find a mysterious lost city of gold.Dora and the Lost City of Gold is an entertaining movie. Director James Bobin has given us a movie, that you can go with your entire family. The adventure set pieces are amazing & the jungles shown in the film, look gorgeous. The comedic scenes are on-point, except for a couple of gags that get a tad bit childish. Isabela Moner is spectacular as Dora. Moner has a vast acting range as she went from her dark & brooding character in Sicario: Day of the Soldado(2018), to her cheery & always positive character in this movie. Isabela Moner has a bright future ahead of her, in Hollywood. Eugenio Derbez is hilarious as Alejandro. Jeff Wahlberg is brilliant as Diego. Madeleine Madden is awesome as Sammy. Nicholas Coombe is superb as Randy. Mikchael Pena & Eva Longoria are outstanding as Cole & Elena, respectively. The CGI'd Boots the monkey, is absolutely adorable. Dora and the Lost City of Gold is worth a watch, with the entire family. Go & get nostalgic about your childhood.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
36,bob-the-movie-man,A fun summer adventure film for kids that's also fun for adults.,7,24 August 2019,"The Plot is a wholly ridiculous story ripped from multiple Tarzan movies of the 40's and 50's. But go with it.Six-year old Dora (Madelyn Miranda) and Diego (Malachi Barton) are having fun growing up in the jungle with their academic parents. (At least, you assume Diego's parents are there somewhere... this is all very vague!). Dora's parents - Cole (Michael Peña) and Elena (Eva Longoria) - are explorers on a lifelong mission to discover the lost Inca city of Parapata. Parapata is famed to be crammed with gold - ""more than all the rest of the world's gold put together"".But Dad makes clear that they are not in it for the financial benefit: the motto is explorers = good; treasure hunters = bad.But Dora's idyllic childhood is rocked when Diego has to return to civilization and she has to grow up alone with her parents.Roll forwards 10 years and Dora has grown. Now as Isabela Moner, she discovers a vital clue to Parapata's location. But this signals a change for Dora, since she is not allowed on the expedition and must go to a far wilder place: to join Diego, now Jeff Wahlberg (nephew of Mark) in an LA high-school.But Mum and Dad are not the only ones on the trail of Parapata's treasures, and together with new friends, the spiky ""mean-girl"" Sammy (Madeleine Madden) and the nerdy astronomy geek Randy (Nicholas Coombe), they must mount a rescue mission that takes them.... you'll NEVER guess where..!The film is a blast for kids, and probably suitable for emotionally robust kids of all ages. Nobody actually dies, despite falling unfathomably long distances onto rocks! However, the film also pulls off that great and welcome trick by dropping in enough jokes for parents to be entertained. ""Yumm... delicioso!"" says young Dora. Then breaking the fourth wall ""Can YOU say delicioso?"". Fleabag-style this confuses the hell out of Mum and Dad. Cole says to Elena, ""Don't worry... she'll grow out of it"". And fortunately, she does before the joke becomes tiresome!There's no warning about drug-taking, since the hallucinogenic scene with exploding flowers will go right over young kid's heads. But I found it very amusing!There are also some fun ""fish out of water"" high school scenes. We've seen many of these before with the likes of Spider-Man, but here they are light-touch and fun.When things get back into the jungle, they take on a much whackier angle. It's all very ""Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull"", but without the crushing disappointment! But again, kids will love the puzzle-solving and the ""Mummy-ish"" gothic humour. The only part of this that I think might disturb young kids is a quicksand scene, that parents might like to pre-warn youngsters that everything will work out fine!Holding the whole film together like a little Duracell Bunny of vitality is 18-year old Isabela Moner, who is a genuine talent, honed in the Nickelodeon studios. She was impressive in the above average ""Instant Family"", and I predict she will go onto great things over the next 10 years.Elsewhere, a ""Pointless"" answer from the cast is Benicio del Toro as the voice of ""Swiper"", a bizarrely talking and poorly-disguised fox! This probably makes more sense to those who know the original kid's cartoon!Even more annoying is Dora's (strangely multi-coloured) monkey Boots... the Jar Jar Binks of the film, who might amuse very young children but probably not many other folks.Final Thoughts: Here's a film that is not trying to be anything other than a fun and much needed summer outing for families. Disney used to do this sort of live-action family film thing so well in the 70's and 80's, before they got obsessed with pointless recreations of their cartoon classics.The director is James Bobin, who's formerly directed a number of the Muppet movies, and this movie breathes with the same sense of anarchic fun without being too up itself.The film occasionally makes you cringe, with some dreadfully (and deliberately) naff songs, but I enjoyed it and for the right audience (kids 8 to 12) I think they'll have a blast.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on this new-fangled internet thing, or else on Facebook... whatever the earth that is.

The jokes are aimed at young kids, such as poop jokes, even a poop song. Not a patch on Toy Story or Lego Movie.There's a dance sequence during the end credits.

People rating this very low obviously are missing a spark of joy in their lives to not have enjoyed this even a bit. The movie set up points and followed through! I think that the audience is young adults who grew up with Dora, I'm 22 and I saw it with college friends and we laughed out loud at so many scenes. It's at it's core a kids movie so don't expect it to be your favorite movie ever but it is funnier and more interesting than it has any right to be. There are cringy moments, of course, it's about a cringy time in a person's life, high school. I was so impressed though at how it handled it's messages, not hitting you over the head like a lot of kids movies these days. It's not the most original and some of the set pieces can look out of place and some parts are just hard to watch but it is very fun and definitely worth some time. Overall I'd say go in with no expectations and get taken for a fun ride.

Also, there's a little of the original ""Crocodile Dundee"" in here, with the whole fish-out-of-water piece when Dora goes to high school.

48,Magow-Intermean,Dora and the Lost City of Gold Review,9,11 August 2019,"After living in a jungle, Dora must learn to survive the harsh and unforgiving world of school life.
Dora (Isabela Moner) has spent her childhood growing up in the jungle along with her parents Cole (Michael Pena) and Elena (Eva Longoria). But now she needs to adapt to a whole new environment - high school. Aided by her cousin Diego (Jeff Wahlberg), Dora must learn the ways of suburban city life. Meanwhile, her parents take off on an adventure of their own - to search for a lost city of gold. A series of events sees Dora taking it on herself to find them along with her new classmates.Drawing inspiration from the Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones series of adventure films, 'Dora and the Lost City of Gold' also has the additional task of connecting its popular television series to this live-action adaptation. It tries to achieve a distinct tone that merges fantasy with reality while its wit appeals to kids and adults alike. This balancing act doesn't always work, but when it does, it makes for an enjoyable watch. The lead role played by Isabela Moner is challenging for the young actor as she's meant to capture the positive, often naïve, attitude of a child while being a vibrant and enthusiastic teenager. Fortunately, she succeeds, and it's impossible not to be drawn to her sparkly nature. Michael Pena and Eva Longoria as her parents will manage to amuse older audiences, who will be disappointed that they don't get to see more of the two actors, along with the slightly mature humour they bring. Instead, we end up with some unnecessary jokes around the call of nature.The plot takes a while to get around to the actual puzzle-solving that's to be expected from this genre but instead, takes off on flights of fancy along the way. The first act particularly struggles to find its identity. The reality-bending narrative might also prove to be a challenge, even though the talking fox Swiper, played by Benicio Del Toro and Boots the monkey are easy laughs. Although it struggles to pinpoint its target audience, the underlying message of being yourself in the face of peer pressure is for all ages. Despite its obvious flaws, 'Dora and the Lost City of Gold' is self-aware, and its whimsical tonality is held together by a strong lead to make for a family-friendly watch.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

PG
director: James Bobin
starring: Isabelle Moner,Eva Longoria,Michael Pena,Eugenio Derbez,Benicio Del Toro,Jeff wahlberg,Madeleine Madden,Nicholas Coombe etcoverall rating 58/100Dora and the lost city of gold is based on the tv show dora the explorer and it focuses on dora moving into the city with her cousin diego. But when her parents go missing in the jungle. Its up to her friends to stop bandits and swiper from finding her parents and discovering the lost city of gold. Dora was watchable but not great in my opinion. Not my type of family film and unfortunately something i would not watch again but it still had some good components.Firstly the film was actually fairy funny in places. Whether it was just how simple and literal Dora was or how they took the mick out of the tv show by her constantly asking questions to the audience. It did make me chuckle a few times whilst watching this was not consistent but done well enough to keep the movie going at a swift watchable pace.However i do have to add that the CGI was pretty bad for a fair amount of moments during the movie. Boots the monkey looked terrible and not realistic at all. This was probably due to the low budget the film has whereas if we take Aladdin which had a much bigger budget Abu looked much better. Just a lot of the set pieces looked incredibley cheap and not realistic especially all the massive flowers that made the characters hallucinate.The film did have a lot of great nostalgia. As someone who did watch the tv show when i was younger. I loved that they added some animation to the map and backpack. And had key phrases,characters and songs from the show that i recognised and appreciated whilst watching. It was still very much its own plot but it was inspired by the tv show which is better in my opinion. As some live actions want to make it completely different to the source material which is not the right creative decision in my eyes.Next i thought the film went slightly to far with how over the top and ridiculous it was. There was many different occasions were Dora would of been either seriously hurt or dead and yet she was absolutely fine after every fall of a cliff. I think a film needs to have some form of reality when it comes to the safety of the characters otherwise it gets to ridiculous and a switch off for me. And when Boots started talking in her head and when there heads turned to animation it just made me laugh at how ridiculous some of it was.Next i found that i was not the target audience for this film and it was slightly to childish for me. I prefer family films with consistent humour with some adult humour chucked in and also films with heartwarming and sweet themes and messages but this film did not really have any of that. It was just very childish and had to many kids jokes that creates a disconnect for me slightly.Next i thought some parts of the plot was very clever and intriguing. Having the film being based on Doras parents being missing and her having to grow up and turn into a leader was interesting and fun to see. But also for her having to adapt to school life was interesting as well. However a large majority of the film especially the high school part was very generic. None of the kids at the high school stood out. A lot of the characters were generic, there was the usual bullies targeting the nerdy kids and taking the mick out of them even the main cast of kids were fairly one dimensional. But as i will get onto in a minute there acting performances shone through there simple characters.A lot of the cast here was excellent especially Michael pena as Doras dad who had many fun one liners and good comedic timing. But also Nicholas coombe was another standout. His character was very relatable and he was walking around like he was in a massive video game and he often saved the day so i liked his character. But the key standout has to be the lead role of Isabella moner as Dora. She was fantastic here and truly shows acting versatility after her excellent performance in instant family. She bought the same bubbily charm and cleverness we have come to expect with this character so you could not help but smile most of the time when she was on screen. Hopefully she gets a lot more acting work after this as she deserves it.However just ending on one slight negative. I thought that the plot twist was very poorly executed. Firstly i thought eugenio derbez worked better as a funny ally then a villain. As he had many funny moments. But also i guessed that he was going to be bad before the twist even happened as he literally said he was the bad guy directly to doras face so it frustrated me at how poorly they executed the plot twist and they should of gone with something different here.Overall Dora is both to generic and childish to be watched again, but yet is still mostly watchable thanks to its humour and the excellent leading performance of Isabella Moner.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
54,kermitkid,Great Movie if You're the right audience for it,8,30 March 2020,"Hilarious movie, but whether you appreciate this film or not, depends on if you grew up with the show, or if you are a parent who had or has a kid who watches it. Most of the jokes are at the expense of how silly the show is. It's essentially a more family-friendly Deadpool, and you can expect nothing less from director James Bobin who did the 2011 Muppets movie. The 4th wall break jokes are very similar to that movie. The plot felt a little too reminescent of ""Spy Kids'' which is one fault I have with it, but this film is still a fun, hilarious adventure for the whole family.

55,ayoreinf,"The right combination of silly, campy and funny woven into fantasy",8,18 August 2019,"Having seen the cartoon character for years as my younger relatives watched on, I was curious how can they make it into a movie, and a fantasy movie of all things. Well they did make it into a movie, and not a bad one. It never takes itself seriously, it wouldn't work if it did. But it also makes campy references to its cartoon origins, and if are familiar with these you'll have to smile at them. It also involves a lot of hammy acting, performed superbly by actors being aware of what they're doing, and combined with normal professional acting. It's not an easy balance to maintain, but the movie does it. If you're not familiar with the source material, it's cringe worthy to say the least. In fact you may not last watching it to the end.So it does have a limited target audience, but if we do count the numbers of kids familiar with Dora the Explorer who grew up into smart aleckish types but still have a sense of humor, it might find enough audience to get by.One more thing I must mention: the entire story is a take on the Wizard of Oz, with Dora(othy) and her three friends all of whom are a bit of brainy scarecrow, a bit of a cowardly lion and a bit of a heartless tinman and they all look for a mysterious legendary city when they'll get there they know all their problems will be solved. I could elaborate further on the similarities, but this review will get too long for this site.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
56,movieman6-413-929510,The live-action Dora film is entertaining for young viewers who know the character.,5,7 August 2019,"Dora and the Lost City of Gold is a live-action film based on the Nickelodeon animation series Dora the Explorer. This live-action film is directed by James Bobin, the director of Muppets Most Wanted and Alice Through the Looking Glass.Dora (Isabela Moner) has spent most of her life exploring the jungle with her parents. Now that Dora is going to high school for the first time, she has to get used to this different way of life.
When her parents are suddenly missing, Dora has to go on an adventure with famous friends and some of her new classmates to discover what happened to her parents. For this they have to solve the mystery behind the lost city of gold.This is an entertaining film for children who are familiar with the animation version of Dora the Explorer and for parents who have seen this animation together with their children. The film is more fun for children, because the story can come across as somewhat predictable or obvious thanks to the simple elaboration for adult viewers. The film looks a bit like a children's version of an Indiana Jones or Tom Raider film. Animation fans can also see or hear certain hints and references in this film that refer to the animation series.
For people who are not so or not at all familiar with the Dora animation series, it may take some getting used to understanding how the fictional world of film works.The effects of the film are also more at the child level, because adult viewers can see earlier where CGI or a green screen is used in the film. Some CGI characters such as Boots Dora her friendly monkey or Zwieber the stealing fox don't seem credible to adult viewers. For children who are fans of the animation and who are familiar with these characters, it is nice to see them again in the film.Isabela Moner appears good and credible in this film as Dora. She looks a lot like a live-action version of Dora because of the clothes and her appearance. With her acting work she carries the film for the young viewers. She also knows how to fill the film with her actions and reaction in the film. For older viewers, Michael Peña manages to provide some comical moments, but because his character goes missing, he soon disappears from the film. For example, as an older viewer you have to watch a film that is mainly filled with humor and a story for younger viewers.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

Anyway, while the live-action adaptation of the show is long overdue, there's no denying that they've absolutely hit the nail on the head with Dora And The Lost City Of Gold, a funny, fresh, bright and irresistibly cheery family film that's as funny as it is often surprising.But we start with the one thing that you really wouldn't expect from the Dora The Explorer movie: that it might actually be more aimed at people who watched the show when they were young, rather than just children nowadays. Of course, the film is absolutely appropriate for viewers of all ages, and its light-hearted and enjoyably adventurous vibes will be more than enough to entertain the little ones, but there is a heap of comedy and references throughout that are squarely aimed at the young adult market - the people who used to watch Dora The Explorer in the early 2000s.More than just a cheery and silly kids' movie, Dora And The Lost City Of Gold is a right laugh even for older viewers throughout. If you didn't watch the show in your childhood, then you might not take to the humour quite as much, but the movie's brilliantly self-aware brand of comedy - poking fun at a handful of the TV show's idiosyncracies - makes for some fantastic laughs throughout, and adds to the riotous, almost anarchic sense of fun that really makes this such a good watch.Because, of course, this film could so easily have been a simple, easy-going Nickelodeon movie aimed squarely at the under-10s audience, with happy characters, silly toilet humour and a generic adventure plot. Now, don't get me wrong, all of that is there to see in this film, but Dora And The Lost City Of Gold really pushes the boat out with anarchic and hyper-self-aware humour and storytelling, something that's not easy to do and still make a good kids' movie.It's not quite on the level of The Lego Movie, which really was a mind-blowing redefinition of what a kids' movie could be, but in similar fashion to the likes of The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out Of Water, which also used nostalgia for the original show and a heap of self-aware in-jokes to great effect, Dora And The Lost City Of Gold can be a riotously funny watch, which was an absolute delight to see.Beyond the humour, though, there's even more to praise about this movie, most of all the lead performance from Isabela Moner. While the whole cast is great fun to watch and entirely on board with the film's often offbeat style, Moner is truly wonderful as Dora herself, playing up the smiley likability of the original character in adorable fashion, but also to such an extent that it's yet another self-aware joke in itself, with Moner's on-screen charisma accounting for a heap of the whole film's entertainment factor.As far as telling a good story goes, I can't say that Dora And The Lost City Of Gold is quite the masterpiece I would have liked to see. On the one hand, it's an energetic and enjoyable adventure movie throughout, and is the explorer movie that Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull never was. On the other, though, it is unavoidably simplistic and generic, and when the comedy isn't working at full capacity (particularly in the second act), the film can feel a little on the dull side for viewers over the age of 5.With that said, the period where the story sags is bookended by an electrifyingly funny opening act, as well as an adorable and genuinely entertaining finale (not to mention a great musical number in the closing credits). And throughout, while it may be difficult to get your head round such a strangely anarchic Dora The Explorer movie, the film's energy and audacity in trying something different is hugely rewarding, proving an immensely entertaining and genuinely likable watch throughout.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

There is a good bit of poking fun at the Dora program but it's very light hearted, and there are some other good laughs as well.The adventure is OK and the added characters are a good addition, with Dora's old friends and foes still around. The acting is quite good and the pace of the film is fine.It won't win many awards but I enjoyed this film and it really does appeal to kids, teenagers who grew up with Dora and adults.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

But it was not that bad, pretty good with obvious some bad parts, which one can live with.
Isabela Merced has really made the character and the role alive. Never liked Dora the cartoon but am familiar with the character and it was a good treat.
Don't expect Tomb raider level stuff but movie is adventurous in a light way.

61,blrnani,"This would get, and deserve, a higher grade from a mid-teen audience",6,19 December 2019,"As it was, I enjoyed the film and especially it's very charismatic bright eyed lead. It is a lovely antidote to the normal jaded and cynical fare we are accustomed to from high-school movies. It is no coincidence that Dora is not of the modern urban environment, but newly drafted in from her jungle home, where she has grown up with far more practical independence and positive attitudes that serve her well in the new challenges facing her. This time it's because they suddenly find themselves in the jungle, but I look forward to seeing a sequel where she uses her abilities to overcome the challenges of the US urban jungle, where the savagery seems to be at least as fierce as in any tropical rainforest! And she has now won over friends to help her on that path.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

63,gk303007,Amateur adventure,5,21 June 2020,"Dora, as a character, is famous among kids and they like watching her in action and solving treasure hunt myteries. This, too, tried hard to create a roller coaster ride but i felt, it failed; if not miserably.Because it was a teen movie so creators did an experiment to intermingle Dora from animation character of kids with adult twists. Like, i didn't find the reason of poop scenes in the kids movie, was it just to extend time? Or there are few hints to the next task which were dubious to make out. Then, the biggest problem with most adventure movies also follows here. Its so tough to travel inside the maze but after you got your treasure, you come out in a snap of time. I mean doesn't the hurdles remain same when you come out?The later part of the adventure seemed more like borrowed from The Mummy Returns. The gold hunt adventure.Anyways, just an ok movie to watch.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
64,MinistryofDoom,A Fun Family Friendly Pre-Teen Tomb Raider,7,10 November 2019,"This was a solid comedy/adventure film full of excitement, great acting, wonderful locations, and humor. A mix of all-star cast and new teen stars worked out splendidly at bringing this big adventure to life. It felt like a combination of the best parts of Indiana Jones and the Goonies, and contained a lot of fan service for those who grew up watching the Nick Jr. cartoon. This is not your typical film adaption by any means and if you're wondering how they could bring some of the characters to life, they just do and it kind of works (as long as you don't apply real world logic). It doesn't take itself too seriously and seems to know and play with the fact that it's source material is a ridiculous cartoon and that kids that the kids that grew up watching that cartoon are now young adults and they're the ones going to see this film. To highlight this point, the film makes a lot of jokes that could be considered a little too risque for the young kiddies that watch Dora cartoons but it's nothing too offensive or obscene by any means. It's just one more way in which the film doesn't take itself too seriously.My only complaint is that at 1 hour and 42 minutes, it was much longer than it should have been. I feel like it could have easily been whittled down to a 90 minutes. It felt unusually long but it's length by no means defines the film as being ""boring"". It's not boring at all. In fact, I enjoyed every moment of the film and I hope that it will get a sequel in the not too distant future. This is very much the filler between Indiana Jones and Tomb Raider, designed to appeal to young kids through teenagers, but also very entertaining for adults as well.Overall a great fun film that keeps it's viewers entertained, children and adults alike. I give this a solid 7 out of 10.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
65,beachy-38431,Almost as good as the original cartoon,9,26 August 2019,"Based on the reported ticket sales, we went in expecting the theater almost empty. It was not. There was an appreciable number of people in the theater. Ages ranged from little kids to their grandparents. The kids looked excited so we asked them how they liked the movie and they said they loved it. I agree with a previous reviewer that some of the jokes were not intended for the kids in the audience. Some were. Isabela Moner is a very pretty young lady, beautiful yes, and will be a beautiful adult actress. She also has great talent. I first saw her in ""Instant Family"". One thing that surprised me was that, even though there were many Hispanics in the movie, I saw NO drug dealers. I have been told that all Latinos are drug dealers.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
66,edicionccq,Dora and the Decent Movie,7,17 November 2019,No one was betting that this movie was going to be good. But somehow it makes his way to be a decent movie. Some jokes are really good and kinda mature but it has a lot of jokes that are just for kids.Watching Dora adapting herself to the city is funny and watching her in the jungle is even funnier. The villains are the weak part of the movie. The villains aren't threating at all. The most amazing part is the chemistry between the teenagers and the acting of Isabella Moner. Also Eugenio Derbez isn't funny,Dora and the Lost City of Gold

We've watched every Disney movie a million times, have to branch out and watch something new. Urgh. Dora...I was laughing in minutes. The silly moment talking to the screen made me shiver with the thought this was going to be a thing, but then they actually laughed AT the Dora thing and moved on. Really made me laugh out loud, to which my daughter asked what I was laughing at!Very good how they nod to the original without over doing it. The cartoon scene, utilising hallucination, very clever.Great actors, all of them, good story, good humour, and nothing to cringe about.And to my suprise my daughter noticed the voice of Moana's father. So still a touch of Disney ;)",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
69,eelen-seth,"""Can YOU say 'extreme neurotoxicity'?""",7,4 September 2019,"Everyone knows Dora The Explorer! Dora is a young Hispanic girl, exploring the wilderness and fantasy-like destinations with her monkey Boots, who wears... red boots. With her bottomless talking backpack and magical map, they sing and dance to get to their goals and break the fourth wall, teaching children another language, one word at a time. (In the USA, Dora helps children speak Spanish. But in Europe, she usually teaches children English, in a playful way.) This all sounds very much like a colourful educational way to keep your toddlers occupied for half an hour, but now there's a full length live action-spectacle. And it's not just for toddlers.Dora and the Lost City of Gold starts off exactly as you would expect - an energetic musical opening number with a CGI-monkey and nephew Diego (Malachi Barton), cruising through the jungle yelling at Swiper the masked fox. To then show us this is all just playful banter. Six-year-old Dora (Madelyn Miranda) and her family of archeologists live in the jungle. One day, Diego and his parents decide to move to the city and Dora stays behind with her parents and best friend Boots.10 years later, Dora (Isabela Moner) records her jungle quests with a GoPro strapped to her chest, interacting with dangerous animals, like a mini Dr. Dolittle. One of her quests leads to the final puzzle piece her parents (Eva Longoria and Michael Pena) were looking for in the search of Parapata - The Lost City of Gold - an ancient civilisation somewhere in the middle of the South-American jungle. Excited as she is, Dora gets ready to join her parents on the adventure of a lifetime, but her parents have another idea. Dora will have to stay with her cousin Diego (Jeff Wahlberg) in the big city, while mom and dad face the wilderness. This might be her biggest adventure yet, since she's never had any teenage interactions and being home schooled by two professors, doesn't prepare you for the threatening challenges of high school.Embarrassed by his cousin's constant positivity and lack of people skills, Diego forgot what it feels like to live a life without any worries or trying to fit in. Dora quickly meets two students she gets along with, the smartest kid in school Sammy (Madeleine Madden) and astrology-enthusiast Randy (Nicholas Coombe). When a school trip to the Natural History Museum goes wrong, our gang gets kidnapped by gangsters, who are also in search of Parapata, and need Dora to find it. This is where the adventure really begins..Director James Bobin (Alice Through The Looking Glass) knows exactly how to shine a new light on this 19 year-old franchise, without losing its essence. He makes the film look playful, yet delivers a serious message about staying true to yourself. A handful of writers perfected the story, which seemed impossible to translate to the big screen. How do you change up a formula that has been around for almost two decades AND convince a new generation?! This is how you do it. By not taking yourself too serious and make fun of what seems too silly to translate from an animated kids-program to a live action family adventure. Dora talking to an imaginary audience doesn't go unnoticed - seems like Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Fleabag found herself a soulmate.Does it bring anything new to the table - no. Does it matter - no. Fart-jokes and Dora creating an instant classic song about pooing in the wilderness, aside, Dora and the Lost City of Gold is hella fun. In a The Goonies-kind-of-way, they explore jungle puzzles through amazing set pieces and clever forgotten Inca-rituals, while John Debney and Germaine Franco's impressive score plays in the background. The CGI-creatures, such as Boots and Swiper (voiced by Benicio Del Toro) are well crafted and true to their original looks. This could've easily turned into another early Sonic The Hedgehog-fiasco, but the visual effects team actually made something unique without going over the top with its design.Moner IS Dora. Period. Once I saw her in Instant Family last year, holding her own next to Rose Byrne and Mark Wahlberg, I knew she could do this. She never loses her charisma and keeps Dora's innocence intact. I can't wait to see this young lady become the star she deserves to be. The supporting cast is very diverse and definitely gets a chance to shine.Dora and the Lost City of Gold is a trippy experience, full of magnificent set pieces and inventive scenes that keep you guessing until the very end.

Don't be afraid to be yourself.

Up until the, 'poo in the jungle,' song it has a great self-mocking humour threaded through the adventure that it loses. It's almost as if directorship got taken over by boring teenagers and it then became only a silly adventure. For me it lost a point for that but still OK for kids.The actors do a good job. The CGI is a mixed bag. Boots the monkey is well done but Swiper the fox looks like he was stitched in after a late production meeting.

also the main teen actors were all really good and you feel things for them
it has some intense scenes as well no scar just keeping you on your seat
it also has a few twists that you won't see coming
now most people think this is just for kids but I have to say I'm 35 and if I can enjoy it then i don't see why others can't
also the girl who plays older Dora is the best and you fall in love with her all through the movie I just wish when I saw this it had subtitles it also teaches you things as it moves along.I recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time and laugh a little",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

The plot follows what one would expect of an adventure film set in the juggle, but te movie offers a twist to every cliche to make it much funnier.
Unfortunately, I felt the third act to be filled with non-sensicals and conveniences, and raised lots of questions in me. How did Eugenio's character manage to follow up close Dora and her friends through the traps unnoticed? Especially since the traps were mortal and would block the path right after Dora went through? How did Swiper manage to go through as well to steal the golden monkey? How did Dora know the water was the key? And what was the water's significance? One or two coincidences for the plot are okay, but I feel the writers had to go through long extends to create the situation they wanted for the climax (Eugenio being present there, Swiper stealing, Dora saving the day). If it had had a more solid third act, I'd probably have given it a 7. Nonetheless, the movie was pretty fun for what it is.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
78,eparazak,"Dora and the Lost City of Gold knows what it is, which is both the movie's advantage and disadvantage.",6,13 August 2019,"You know Hollywood wants to make movies about anything when they're making something like Dora and the Lost City of Gold. This movie follows our titular heroine Dora who moves to the city after living in the jungle and she has a hard time fitting in. When she, her cousin Diego and some other students get captured while on a field trip, however, they need to find a way to locate Parapata, a lost city of gold.When going into a movie about Dora the Explorer, I didn't know what to expect. I grew up with the tv show, and it's not one that I think holds up well. After seeing this, I gotta say, this movie is absolutely stupid and ridiculous. They, however know this and embrace it! This is a tongue-in-cheek, self-aware, silly movie that is sure to entertain kids. Its target audience isn't the preschool demographic, so there's that to watch out for though. This is a movie that barely takes itself seriously. For example, in the beginning of the film, Dora talks to the camera as a way to poke fun at the show. When the movie transitions from live-action to the show's traditional look when the characters go through a flower field, you should know not to take it seriously.With this being said, however, there were some goofy elements that really didn't do it for me. One example of this is that the movie has a few poop jokes and poop-related scenes, and they weren't clever. There was an entire scene dedicated to figuring out how one of them would poop in the jungle. It's a joke that really dragged for me. Aside from that, the movie rarely worked when it tried to be serious. For example, we have the scenes where she tries to fit in with her peers at school. Dora comes off as being a very smart individual, and there's often a certain charm to this trope. However, it isn't present here, and scenes like these come off as awkward. The two students that Dora and Diego go on their journey with seem like they hate being part of the adventure, and despite the character development, it just tends to rebound, as if hating the journey is the status quo of their characters.With all my criticisms, I do like Isabela Moner as Dora. I think she did a great job embodying the spirit of her character, and had the charisma that I remembered from the actual show. I genuinely enjoyed her performance.Dora and the Lost City of Gold is a wonderfully stupid movie that knows what it's doing. It's not like the original show, and it certainly doesn't have to be.6/10",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

81,Clank_Zoka,Nickelodeon Movies is Back..-sh,7,1 September 2019,"Dora the Explorer...., many people know her and the Nick Jr show, it was quite populated back in the day, it was a interactive animated series for very young children, I never really got into the series when I was young, only watching a few episodes since I was child who didn't know any better, I was Into the interactive CBeebies shows then Dora, so I knew there was going to be a film based on the series, the trailers look like... exactly was it was going to look like, a basic, simple and childish film based on the series, so Paramount and Nickelodeon decided to take this opportunity and make a live-action movie based on the series, after the box office flop Wonder Park, Dora and the Lost City of Gold could be a return to form for Nickelodeon Movies, I didn't see it when it came out since at the time I didn't have plans to see it, but I got a chance to see it yesterday and....... it was surprisingly pretty good, nothing amazing but not a bad film at all, so let's talk about it.Dora the Explorer (Isabela Moner) has been in the jungle for a very long time, but since she is now sixteen, her parents (Michael Peña & Eva Longoria) decided that to move her to the big city at a high-school where she is reunited with her cousin Diego (Jeff Wahlberg), who then meets Randy (Nicholas Coombe) and Sammy (Madeleine Madden), all four ended getting shipped back to Jungle after some mercenaries capture them, however they are saved by a old friend of Dora's parents Alejandro (Eugenio Derbez), he can help them find the Lost City of Gold that Dora and his parents were looking while at the same time, look for her parents and avoiding getting caught by the mercenaries and... Swiper, this sounds like more of a parody of the show then a actual film, it has a plot and everything, but it just feels like a parody of Dora, also it feels like it should of been aired on TV then in cinemas, because while it's has it's fun and entertaining moment, it doesn't really feel movie-worthy, with that said I think it has better elements then the show ever did, it has humour which is quite self-aware, it makes fun of the source material a lot which is what makes it even funnier, it also has a lot of fun action, chase scenes, getting out of situations and solving puzzles, It's honestly quite fun, even when Dora is in High school, that can get amusing and funny with the whole ""fish out of water"" segment, there is also a twist while it is predicable, it did make sense, however!....., this plot and writing still has flaws, while it is funny, it does mostly rely on toilet humour, which can get a little chuckle but it's pretty standard sort of humour, the film is also pretty predicable, confusing, odd and feels exactly like a Nickelodeon TV movie, but that's kind of the point, it's not trying to be a Pixar or a Disney, it just wants to be a fun, entertaining, safe and funny film, normally I would bash a film for being all of that since it can get frustrating, here it's kind of a breath of fresh air to see a film embrace it's flaws and just goes for it, it may not be anything special, it has humour that is what you expect in a kids film, just filler and not at all funny, along with a plot that we have seen so many times, being quite predicable too, however it's not trying to be a masterpiece, it's just trying to be a fun kids film, with a good moral, clever and funny humour, heart, engaging action sequences and fun puzzle solving, in other words, this is what the series should of been.The visuals are really nothing amazing, like the idea, it really looks like a TV movie not really a ""movie"" movie, however it's not completely bland, it has nice shots of the Jungle and the temples, along with well done action sequences that involves chases, puzzle solving and getting out of situations like quick said and a room that floods the entire area full of water, it also has good production design to it as well, the CGI isn't half bad as well, Boots and Swiper look very convincing, although a bit uncanny but looks good enough in CGI, the costumes look cool especially on Dora, heck even at one point, there is scene that uses the animation from the series and uses it in a creative and fun way, however despite good efforts in the visuals, there are a few things that are pretty ""basic"", the visuals are not amazing, just a basic high school and basic jungle with temples and puzzles, the CGI is well done but at times it can look very uncanny and out of place, with Boots, Swiper as fine as their designs are, they look incredibly weird and creepy looking, the effects can look quite fake and doesn't feel like it's in the film, but besides that, I think the visuals do stand out in their own right and make the fun a lot of fun to look at!.The characters are pretty entertaining, wacky and funny all at the same time, I do really like Dora, she is very cheery, charming, fun and hilarious, I can see her being a inspiration or even a role model for some, Diego is fine, he never stood out for me, he's just okay for the most part, Randy is just the nerdy kid who has a thing for Dora, Sammy is the bossy one and ""class president"" character, if that makes sense, Dora's parents are funny and do play a key role but they don't really do much in the film, they are very supportive and likeable parents, they are one of the reasons why Dora needs to go back to the Jungle, Alejandro helps Dora and her friends to find her parents and the Lost City of Gold, he is easily the best character in the film, he is funny, charming and interesting, I really enjoyed him along with Dora, although his role does become obvious as film goes on, but he is still a entertaining character, Boots is Dora's sidekick and he is cute, but can get quite funny now and then, Swiper is entertaining and is even funnier then the show, as the cast, they are pretty great!, Isabela Moner is fantastic as Dora, she looks the part, plays the part and just has fun with the part, I really did enjoy her a lot, Michael Peña is funny as Dora's Dad, Eva Longoria is lovely as Dora's Mum, Jeff Wahlberg is perfectly fine as Diego, Madeleine Madden and Nicholas Coombe Are fine as Sammy and Randy, they do a okay job as Sammy and Randy, Eugenio Derbez is excellent and hilarious as Alejandro, Danny Trejo as Boots is very out of place but very funny, Benicio Del Toro as Swiper is perfect and funny, the characters have something unique about them, if it's charm, comedy, relatability or entertainment, they do make the experience a lot more fun then others, thanks mostly to the great cast who make these characters fun.Wow...... I didn't expect to like anything related to Dora the Explorer, but..... this is so much better then the actual show!, Dora and the Lost City of Gold is one of the bigger surprises of this year, with a enjoyable plot with great action and comedy, glorious and creative visuals, funny and likeable characters along with great performances, however at the same time, it is very cliched and standard as a kids film, the humour can get unfunny at times, it visual looks pretty basic and a few characters don't leave much of a impact, overall?, I liked it, as a kids film, I think it's good, as just a film, It's quite decent, take the family or the children to see this, it is a film more for them then anyone over the age of ten or eleven, but I do recommend this if you are a fan of the series or if you want to give this film a chance, this is what I wanted from Nickelodeon Movies for a very long time and this been their best since the Adventures of Tintin, either way, no rush to see it, but it was a pleasant surprise, not great, but it is, what it is.I'm going to give Dora and the Lost City of Gold 7.8/10.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
82,pfne,Far better than it has any right to be ..,8,14 July 2021,"A live action movie based in a little kids cartoon, it should have been a cheap, poorly made, dodgily acted and childish movie that's forgotten 5 minutes after you turn it off through boredom.This movie tho, this movie is fantastic. It's witty and charming and sticks to the Dora 'Lore' closely. It's fantastically made and beautifully shot. It's a kids adventure film that anyone can enjoy.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
83,jaywensley2004,Are you open to the jokes?,7,10 August 2019,"The skill most demanded when making a movie based on a kid's program like ""Dora the Explorer"", is to make it interesting for the adults who are going to shepherd the kids to the theater. If the first wave of adults don't bring back reports of a movie that was entertaining for them, inevitably the rest of the adults will just sit back and wait for the film to be released on DVD or streaming services, rather than make the effort to attend a theater screening.The success of ""Dora and the Lost City of Gold"" is going to rest mostly on the charms of star Isabela Moner. When she grins wide-eyed into the camera and chirps lines like ""Can you say 'delicioso'?"", whether or not the adults get the irony she conveys is going to mean EVERYTHING when it comes to the potential of ""Dora"" as a franchise.To be sure, the reducted ""Indiana Jones""-type story is interesting, though it has enough gaps in its logic that anyone over the age of 12 is likely to go ""HUH?"" several times before they finally just accept that the narrative is meant to be simple enough for their youngsters to follow. And the characters are every bit as one-dimensional as befits a live-action version of a tv show whose demo is the grade school set. But ""Dora and the Lost City of Gold"" is fast-paced enough to keep anyone's attention through its flaws, and if you stay alert, there are plenty of smirks and snark to entertain the adults in the room...if you are receptive to irony and a fair amount of camp. Oh, and of course a few poop and fart jokes.Myself, I can't stop laughing at the memory of the scene in which Isabela Moner (Dora) hitches while delivering one of the tv show's signature lines: ""Swiper! No swiping!"" The verbal eye-roll as she boldly invites the audience to get in on the joke is...delicioso!""Dora and the Lost City of Gold"" gets seven stars.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

86,sme3,Uneven but Entertaining,7,13 October 2019,"Adults should have a pleasant time watching Dora and the Lost City of Gold. While consistently enjoyable, this film cannot seem to decide what it is. Fans of the original television series may at times be upset when this film plays more as parody than a live-action version of the animated series. Both resembling the animated character enough and having the charisma to anchor a feature film, Isabela Moner is an inspired casting choice.

That was an insane amount of fun, despite having never watched the original. When the trailer of this movie came out, I expected it to flop, but no. This was good. Not as good, but good.The first few minutes established the tone of the movie to be light-hearted and self-satire. Isabela carried the movie all the way with her excellent performance. The plot twists were expected, and there were a ton of foreshadowing for different plot points which was actually nice.

Watching it as an adult, it is a very cheesey film. Some scenes are self aware and is almost a parody of the original show. It is a fun film, but it is very light and cheesey. It is worth a watch for fans of the show, just remember that it is intended for kids.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

Come on you had one job!! If you're gonna do a Dora movie, why do it like this?? Swiper is pretty identical to the cartoon so what's the excuse? The film makes a point about Boots not being able to speak outside Dora's imagination and I find that just heartbreaking.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
94,sala151183,Better than I expected!!,6,19 August 2019,"So I've never watched a minute of the tv show but knew of it.
Think Dora was better than I expected because I was expecting a very very childish film, yes it had its moments for the young ones but I think they went a little on the PG side too.
I felt they cast Dora very well.
So it may have felt a little long towards the third act and maybe snipping 10 minutes would of been ok.
I dot like the introduction of Dora and how her world made her who she was.
Dora wasn't so bad after all",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

Just do 2 seconds of research. But the movie itself was too superficial even for a kids movie. The acting was goofy and uninteresting and the monkey was just annoying and uncreative. Also the dialogue was flat and didn't build any relatable characters. It was overall just a big mess with no substance.,Dora and the Lost City of Gold

Surprisingly entertaining. This movie is just amazing and the acting from everyone was great. Dora have a good role model for everyone in this world.

It definitely worth to watch.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

98,kikoydaba3,"hit and miss humor, isabela merced is dynamite, average direction",5,5 December 2019,"Dora and the Lost City of Gold is targeted for the young audience, but it doesn't exempt the movie from an honest assessment of its quality.Story-wise, Dora has a good first half but crumbles in the second half. The story is humorously clever and engaging when the focus is on Dora's oddness in the first half. During the treasure adventure in the second half, Dora's story and character growth losses focus and take a backseat to plot progression. Isabela Merced is dynamite, though. Her screen presence carries the film in its weaker moments and what makes Dora such a fascinating character. When the humor is focused on her character's personality, it works, but when the side characters are the ones making jokes, it comes off as forced owing to their lazy characterization. Despite the middling script, Dora is ridiculously over the top and cheeky and the reason it is watchable. The best touches of humor came during the trap door and animated-dream state scenes of Dora and gang.Overall, the artistic qualities are average. The direction is quite uninspired and sloppy. The CGI is obvious and distracting, especially to Boots. The cinematography is also poor.What is undeniable, though, is the movie's charm. Had the writing been given more clarity and vision Dora, would be much better.5/10",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

My first impression was that this was obviously a kids movie, and that there must have been a back story I didn't know about, but I found Dora pretty likeable and the whole thing had some good humor to it, so I kept watching.

Now this is where the funny bits start to appear, poor Dora is so contempt with jungle life that she thinks its the same for ""real"" life, other school kids try to bully her but she doesn't understand what is exactly going on which is a laugh.But then she heres her parents have gone missing and she has to go back with Diego to find them in the jungle, then they are met by a friend of Dora's parents who help them through the jungle, Dora not knowing that he is actually evil and ends up setting them up.The film has a lot of funny parts to it which we enjoyed and Isabela Moner was a great choice for Dora, all in all don't go into to this film expecting violence, its a good laugh and i look forward to the 2nd one, if there is one.Age: 25 - Cinema: Cineworld Milton Keynes 2D Normal Screen",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

Looked almost like all the females were wearing body armor to make sure there was nothing pointy. Many of the characters were caricatures, and that was alright, it's based on a cartoon. My few gripes were from an adult perspective. It could have had a little more overt humor. It had quite a bit, but it was toned down. And - ok, it's fantasy, but the ending in the temple stepped over the line on silly. Target audience: 13 to 16, and they achieved that by making Dora suddenly 18ish. Oh, and Boy! did she have a pound of pancake on. The persistent close-ups really highlighted that. Oh well, little stuff. Lightweight fluff. Thumbs up.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

The transition to live action was great, and they way they dealt with things like backpack were clever and humorous. The actress who played Dora was terrific, although some of the supporting cast less so, and there were some really good moments, especially early.The desire to also have adventure story was where it started to fall down, a silly script, actors unable to carry it, and not much of any real interest.

129,wesperkins,"Wow, surprisingly very good!",9,31 January 2021,"I figured with today's Hollywood culture, they would insist that this movie be another attempt to try and get their agenda put in it. It's not, and there are no forced messages other than being upbeat and positive. What a rare thing these days from Hollywood. It has a Jumanji feel, and is fun for adults and kids, and is a pretty clean movie so the kids can watch it safely. There are a couple of potty jokes (literally about doing a number 2) but no cursing. I had low expectations going in, but by the end was engrossed and fully into it. A hidden gem, and this is from someone who hated Dora the cartoon.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

It isn't a movie that is trying to blow you away or make you think about the realities of life. Based on that my expectations were not so high... but boy! this movie was ridiculous and hilarious. It is one of those feel good movies that make fun of itself and doesn't try to be anything else. I really enjoyed it.Give it a try if you need a pick me up!,Dora and the Lost City of Gold

This movie had so much of that cartoon in it, kind of nostalgic for me but geared for 8 year old kids I think.

The movie was bad, but I would have to recommend it, it's weird, I enjoyed this film, which was such a surprise.Choosing Danny Trejo to voice Boots was the best decision of all time, I don't know who made that call, but they are a genius.In all seriousness, the lead who played Dora did a genuinely good job portraying Dora, and it was fun to watch the other characters react to how crazy and insane Dora was. The story was simple and easy to follow, and there were some laughs that came out of me. The movie was also really creative, well it was, sometimes.But apart from the fun I had, the movie had some of the worst acting I've ever seen, Diego, was, oh god, so bad, like so so bad. It was like staring at a brick wall, he had no emotion, Dora's parents were also really bad.ah, stopI shouldn't complainwatch this mess of a movie for yourself.

I really only watched a few episodes of Dora's drawing: The Adventurer (Título BR). And yet I don't really appreciate the cartoon. I think this is because I am not a four or five year old child. The interesting thing is that I really liked the movie. I was surprised that the film got 84% approval on Rotten Tomatoes and negative reviews from the audience. The film is quite fun, has charismatic characters and a very interesting story. (Estilo sessão da tarde). I thought the jokes about the drawing itself were great, which basically bring the main character's traits to our reality and that that would be considered strange. (Who would look at nothing and say: Can you say ""Delicious""?). Amazing! Isabela Merced is wonderful as Dora, but Madeleine Madden is my favorite as Sammy. Even if the joining of the four characters is a bit forced, it is beautiful to see them helping each other throughout the film. I loved the music. It doesn't get out of my head. : 3 About the carelessness they had with the children about the mating jokes, the plants that cause daydreams and etc. Here in Brazil, the film had an indicative rating of 10 years. So it's kind of weird to take children ages four and five to the movies. ^^ (But I still understand foreigners. At least a little.) In short: The film is fun, welcoming and a good pastime.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
135,jfenn53058,"4-5 year old bored, 10-13 enjoyed it",8,23 August 2019,"Overall they did a great job with many nods and references to cartoon Dora. The issue is that cartoon Dora is meant for young children, while the intense temple amd warriors/magic scenes in the last 30 minutes of the movie are not cartoonish, but are instead intense at a level above the normal audience of the cartoon.Our four-year-old granddaughter was enthralled with the first 20 minutes but then quickly lost interest. The 10 & 13-year-old granddaughters loved it and there were several laugh out loud moments.If only they could have lightened up the temple/treasure scenes of the last 30 minutes.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

The acting is way over the top (as you *should* expect) and the story avoids any emotion depth, which is again, what you should expect.With all this said, it should be viewed ONLY by those having watched the TV show.In the end, however, all its shortcomings are made up with a sense of warmth and fun that exceeds expectations.

I am by no means the target audience, but for a kids film, it's still surprisingly intelligent and enjoyable. It's no masterpiece and there is plenty of cringe placed throughout, but it's still a fun adventure film for kids. The movie is formulaic with so much stuff that I have seen done better in other films, but it's just a fun entry point for kids. It's basically Indiana Jones for kids",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

141,LinaInverse23,So much fun!,8,14 August 2019,"The writing in this movie is wonderful, and everyone involved all knew how this film should be portrayed. Dora never takes itself too serious, and it's extremely enjoyable to watch.
Isabela Moner is a delight to watch, she portrays a high school Dora perfectly. Her enthusiasm shines, and her energy carries the movie. All of her fellow actors also bring some level of fun to the film, despite their lack of development. Notable performances were Madeleine Madden as Sammy and Nicholas Coombe as Randy.
The humor was excellent, still family friendly, and many fourth wall breaks. The theater erupted in laughter at many of the jokes, and the film was able to make fun of itself, which for a Dora movie, was most definitely necessary. The story was fairly fast-paced (although more high school drama with Dora would have been funny), and the fun never stops. The musical score was also reminiscent of a 90's movie with themes for each character and more.
Enjoy the film for what it is, have fun with your family and friends, and do yourself a favor- see what is probably the best comedy this year.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

147,JuniorTorres720,Fun Live Action Introduction for Childhood Favorite!,10,26 January 2020,"There's always that fear that a character that was so beloved as a cartoon will be diluted as a live action character. Thankfully, Dora's iconic character did not live up to those fears. On the contrary this movie added even more dimensions to the character. Isabela Moner was the best pick for the role. I don't know who else could have brought Dora to life. This movie was fun, had nice emotional touches, and fun action sequences for a general audience. It was easy to get invested into the characters and maybe the nostalgia and childhood memories helped. But overall, I believe any viewer, whether they've seen Dora in the past or not, can attach themselves to these characters and truly the story.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

Most of the jokes were spot on for the movie being self aware of what it was and what it was doing.The pacing of the movie is so quick you don't have time to fully process the experience when you WANT to process the experience.,Dora and the Lost City of Gold

152,irvinetustin,I didn't watch Dora growing up but I enjoyed this movie,10,25 August 2019,"When I saw the trailer it looked like a cute family film and that's what I wanted to see. I was an adult by the time the Dora the Explorer TV show came on the air, but she was so famous I ended up hearing about her anyway. Her show sounded like a fun way to teach kids about different places in the world and also to expand their vocabulary. Dora was a little girl in the cartoon, and I wanted to see what they would do with her story as a teenager. The actresses that they chose both for the child Dora and teenage Dora were excellent choices as they both looked, sounded and acted a lot like the cartoon character. And I liked how in the story it gave us a funny and entertaining look at what Dora's life would be like if she were a real person both as a child and as a teenager. It is well written, with good special effects and great acting. It's a feel-good family film that is well done that left me smiling.

153,fran-ohmsford-417-318109,Hollywood doesn't understand children,3,5 April 2020,"At 8 years old I was watching Raiders of the Lost Ark and Temple of Doom, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, The Vikings, Zulu and Clash of the Titans.
This is one of those movies that seems to have been aimed straight at an 8 year old audience yet doesn't understand that that audience is perfectly able to tell a good movie from a bad one.
Seeing the trailer I was expecting a much better movie, one that took the cartoon and worked with it but unfortunately the trailer lied. The jokes that worked in the trailer didn't work in the movie past the first 5-10 minutes, After that they just seemed to forget that the audience for Dora the Explorer is quite a bit older now and want more than the odd blatantly throwin in reference.
And again - Even were that audience not older now 8 year olds still want more from a movie than they expect from a daytime TV Cartoon!
These are different media and different rules apply!
Was Dora and the Lost City of God better than say Masters of the Universe? NO! No it wasn't, because despite that particular movie hugely disappointing many fans of He-Man back in 1987 {I was 10 then} it didn't try to PANDER to kids! Frankly I personally still enjoy re-watching Masters of the Universe even today - More than I enjoy re-watching the cartoon it was very loosely based on.
I took my nieces to the cinema to watch Sonic {a good movie that doesn't PANDER to kids} which they loved - I'm glad I didn't waste money taking them to see this because they'd have been bored very quickly!",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

157,karolinecelis,Not a bad movie makes a good comedy film,6,19 December 2020,"Normally I don't do many reviews for movies, and television shows I watch this is a decent comedy movie, and also based off a childhood show I grew up watching. The main character the actress that plays grown up Dora is beautiful, but the point of this is that the characters could be better let's be honest here. Actually I watched the movie the second time this year in 2020, and Dora's cousin he could've been better to tell the truth. Also that was not okay to speak to someone like that when there's someone that hasn't lived in a city before or hasn't moved into a foreign country before. Dora's cousin sounds like an angsty teen boy who's socially awkward and you know how boys function in the real world.Also I still know these actors for the Dora movie, so I am unsure what movies or shows these actors are in actually. The humor in this movie are actually decent or average honestly. In real life I feel like sometimes people try too hard to make their jokes sound funny depending what kind of jokes they are joking about some are funny, inappropriate, and kinda dark.Maybe the story in the movie could use some improvements for instance, it's better if Dora makes her own choices of how she wants to live her life, although living in the real world than what she wants is actually better for her. Dora would have to socialize with others, getting an education, and later in life get job, and live their life to the fullest. This movie is about Dora the explorer that just want to go out and adventure, and finds all answers to everything especially finding the treasure when her parents tells her that treasure hunting is bad. Because of thievery and greed. Mercenaries treasure hunters are bad because they are willing to kill others for material items including treasure. Money doesn't solve all your problems including your happiness.Also Dora in the real world of her getting an education and trying to stay true to herself is actually hilarious, and unusual. Because Dora is based off a cartoon character from an original cartoon series for children that lives amongst nature, but in the movie she goes out to live in a city and live a normal life.There's only one character I still don't like which is her cousin and I can't forget how he treated Dora that she should stop trying to be herself. Diego does have about point about not trying too hard to be yourself. Let's be real it's actually hard trying your best to be yourself, and the truth is that some people are kinda cold, unemotional, unloving, and unsupportive. I'm not saying everyone is unfriendly it's hard for us to go through life trying to stay positive all the time, when in reality there will be times things will be difficult for instance, COVID-19 and quarantining at home makes us feel more lonely, and isolated which is actually bad for your mental health. There are studies that show that being alone or isolating yourself too much takes toll on your mental health.Overall I think this movie is good to watch with family, funny, comedic, and light hearted film if you like watching these type of movies. If you prefer watching movies that aren't comedic, funny, and light hearted watch something that suits your taste. Also the antagonist for the movie that played as the good guy, and turns out to be a bad man who wants the treasure for greed, also he's selfish no one ever said anything bad about him. So I am unsure what his issue about being too sympathetic, he must have lack of empathy from his parents. It's okay to be sympathetic but when forgiving others that can be difficult. Because it takes a bunch of work to get someone to trust and forgive you. Some people don't try to be sympathetic towards others. Because they can't get back for what they said or done. That's kinda cold to be honest. So no matter what don't be too hard on yourself and be gentle, and kind to yourself.Also if you like light hearted, funny, and comedy movies alike this movie is definitely something you want to watch which gives good vibes.

The movie does take a while to get going (it's surprisingly long at about an hour and 40 minutes), but once it does, it's entertaining until the end. The characters are all very likable in their own ways (including the villains), and it's a fun movie to watch overall. That said, I'm not sure I'd recommend this to people that aren't at least a little bit familiar with the Dora the Explorer TV show, because if you aren't then a LOT of the jokes and references will be lost on you (and some of said jokes get run into the ground). If you can get past that, though, then this movie's absolutely worth seeing.

Yet so many fall short with too much dialogue and drag on. It covered all basis and had something for everyone to relate too. Even abit of adult humour.

181,neymacaspac,Funny,6,23 August 2019,"Watching the cartoon show as kids is kind of great, well that's how they also manage to incorporate the vibe of the animated show, starting with the music and the intro. The fish out of the water character of Dora is funny enough but sometimes feels over but the target audience here are children and kids at heart so you'll manage to tone down your expectations and watch how they introduce a teenage Dora the Explorer into High School that tumbles their way into trouble and adventure.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
182,ladyviola80,Bad....really bad,4,14 November 2019,"My kids (ages 7, 9, 11 & 13) didn't even like this movie and I feel bad because I was the one who suggested this snooze fest. Acting was ok, storyline was unbelievable and full of cliches, and it was overall incredibly boring. I'm convinced that the positive reviews are all fake. 4 stars because the actress who played Dora actually looked and acted how you'd expect a real life Dora to. I wish Hollywood would come up with something new instead of recycling old movies and shows that we've all seen before. It's getting ridiculous. Pass on this movie because it's not worth your time.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
183,oldgirldv,"Fun, funny adventurous family movie",10,24 September 2019,"Even our reluctant teenagers loved it. I am not a big fan of the Dora the Explorer series, but some of my kids have been. Some of my boys were reluctant to watch the movie (but it was a better option to doing homework and housework), but they admitted afterwards that it was pretty good.
It was entertaining, fun, funny, a bit over the top, but that made it even better. A few surprises through the movie helped too.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

The theater I watched it in was pretty empty, but ultimately me and my friends had great laughs and a great time despite the fact I still have two essays to complete this Monday.

And believe it or not it's well acted and a lot of fun, especially if you have a kid(s) who watched the tv show or watched yourself.

188,richardrehder,Shh... Don't Tell Anyone I Liked It,8,21 November 2019,"Wow! Coming out of that I am not only more satisfied than I ever thought I would be but also surprised as well over how well the property was handled. What they have done with Dora is beyond anything they have done before, and I would even say that this might be one of the best and most accurate representations of a kids show on the big screen. Now I've never seen a ton of Dora before but as an animation fan, a Spanish fan, and a big kid I have seen a few of Dora (and Deigo) and I was laughing my of at the references and inside jokes, the fact that they make light of how weird she Dora can be is done so well and in such a way that it doesn't come off too cheesy or feel like pandering. It seems to have struck a perfect balance between being a big screen version of the character and making it just grown up enough to speak to more than it's base audience. I definitely enjoyed this film. It even surprised me in that in a few situations the character made different descions than they would normally in a movie like this or for that matter different than I thought they would as well. A worthwhile watch if you are entertaining kids or not.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

191,jleeee,For kids,7,4 January 2020,"My friend and I agreed to watched this movie in the cinema judt for the laughs and the laughs truly delivered but the story didnt.The introduction was great and probably needed to know some background knowledge to understand this movie. Everything was great until the middle act. These people wants to find Dora's parents so they can find the lost city of gold.But the problem is that there is unnecessary things along the way that stops the movie and the plot from moving it foward. The plot is also easily predictable and a childish, which the movie is meant for.I didnt have the best movie experience but certainly had a good one. This movie is directed at younger audience and the film does it well.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

193,johan-herstad,"Truly fun, classic adventure storytelling",8,28 December 2019,"This movie doesn't take itself too seriously and that is very refreshing in these times. It has a good message of optimism and being true to yourself. The main character, Dora, is a nuclear power plant of optimism, a superpower and a direct force for change. The ending song over the credits exemplifies this perfectly.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
194,parisjej,My 5 year old and I loved it!,9,14 August 2019,"The fact that she is a teenager that can't fit in bc she was raised in the Jungle as a scavenger hunter is a highly appropriate storyline for all the kids that grew up with Dora. This movie was very good, Dora was so cute, fun, always positive, highly intelligent, very aware, resilient, forgiving, and she had all the faith in the world. She would make a great best friend. Maybe we should homeschool our kids in the jungle? Overall very funny adventurous family movie, everyone will enjoy. Shows kids that when they go to high school they don't have to fit in, just be themselves and be a good person, don't worry what ppl think, and everything will work out in their favor.

197,vgarcia-61583,Why does this exist!,1,7 August 2019,"A live action Dora movie... You heard me right. As of now, how does this have a 79% in Rotten Tomatoes? Some critics said it is fun, but I don't think so.
Dora was my childhood, my favorite TV show! When I first saw the trailer, I thought is was a joke. When I realized it was real, I gave up on humanity. When I went to the theaters to see Toy Story 4 ( a crowded theater btw) the Dora trailer came on and the entire theater burst out laughing. It was amazing. I laughed and cried. So the day is premiered in my theater, me and my family spended our money to see this trash. I got my money back. I just couldn't handle it. I tried to give it a chance, but it was just a failure. And I have a lot of questions. Why is Dora a teenager? Why is it live action? Why is this even a movie?",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

200,ChristopherTheReviewer2020,My Review for Dora and the Lost City of Gold (2019),7,18 February 2021,"Hi everyone, Its Christopher the reader here and the Movie we are here to talk about tonight is Dora and the Lost City of Gold. When I was younger I really like Dora the explorer so when I saw the trailer for this I decided to watch it when I could. I first watched this Movie on 17th of February. I am now going to talk about some of the Movie details. It was rated PG and was first aired on the 2nd of August in 2019 and came out a few months later in other places. The Movie was based on the Tv Show Dora the Explorer by Chris Gifford, Valerie Walsh and Eric Weiner. It was directed by this person (James Bobin), the story was by these two (Tom Wheeler, and Nicholas Stoller) and was created by these two people (Nicholas Stoller, and Matthew Robinson) I've also have seen a book of the movie but have'nt read yet I may in the future. The book was written by this person (Steve Behling). The Movie has a runtime of 1h 42min, and was also said to have been filmed at this place for the Jungle scenes (Tarapoto, Peru) and in these places in Australia for the most of the movie (Village Roadshow Studios, Oxenford, Queensland and Brisbane, Queensland) This was what the estimated budget was said to been ($49,000,000)The film had good inside jokes which only people who has watched the show would understand, if you haven't watched any of the episodes I suggest you watch a few before you watch the movie. I do believe that this movie is more for people who use to watch the show when they were younger and now they are older as it does also have a few jokes that little one's wouldn't probably understand. I liked that the movie had a few mild intense scenes. I think that the filming was pretty good and I liked some of the scenery, I think that it could have been a bit better if the transition between young Dora as she got older was shown and not just skipped 10 years later. I would have liked to have seen some time-lapse.I liked the mini parkour scene that was in one of the scenes in the Movie, I think it was pretty cool. There were a few scenes where some words were spoken in another language like in the show. so if you have the option, I would say to watch the movie with subtitles turned on. The jokes are mature enough for adults to laugh but, would work for older children as well, I don't think for younger children as like I said it does have some mature stuff in. After Dora left the juggle the movie kind of gave me vibes of a another movie called ""Life-Size"" was which I watched a few times when I was younger. I liked the part in the movie where it changed for a bit in cartoon form for a while, I think that was pretty cool. I didn't actually get to meet Diego from the TV Show as they were only just talking about introducing him to the show or something when I stopped watching the show. So I was happy that I got to kind of meet him in this Movie.I thought that some of the clothes that characters had on in the middle of the movie were a bit too clean especially after what they went through in the juggle at the time. I personally think it would have been a bit better if it was shortened down a bit as I thought that it was a bit lengthy, I would have liked it to have been around one hour long instead of two. I really liked the special effects and I thought that the voice overs for the characters that had them were really good which also suited there characters well. I liked the acting overall, I thought it was good and the way I pictured Dora if she wasn't a cartoon was the way she was in this movie, I thought that the animals in the movie looked cool. I would have like to have seen a bit more of the character, swapper throughout the movie as we didn't get to see him that much. I did found the Movie slightly Predictable at times.Anyway for people who liked Dora I think that they will probably enjoy this movie. If they ever make a sequel, I would go and watch it. My top five favourite characters from the Movie, starting at number five has to be, Sammy, Nico, Dora, Diego, Randy and then Boots. If I was a character in the Movie 's world, I would have probably would have been more like Randy's character, For each Movie that I watch, I rate it out of 10, so for this I'm going to give it 7. Remember this was what I thought about the Movie personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself, as it will maybe be one of you're favourites, you never know.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
201,zenfakor,"Do not ""Swipe"" by this one. #swipernoswiping",10,15 February 2021,Just watched this with my 15yo & 12yo. They loved Dora as kids and we watched this tonight on 02/14/21 and cracked up the whole time. I thought it was well acted and hysterical. Definitely a great family movie. Take a chance and watch this one. 5 out of 5 Boots.,Dora and the Lost City of Gold
202,abooody1111,Bad Plot,5,16 August 2019,"Very very bad plot ,, I just watched because of Isabela . The story is expected and not convincing for adults but the children will like it.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
203,Bergtop,Beware! Movie for families who watched Dora in the past,7,8 August 2019,"I watched the movie with my kids aged 10 and 11. I liked it, they liked it. But it was not that long ago that I watched cartoon Dora with them. So we laughed at the inside jokes and The cartoonesk way Dora is portrayed. We also felt nostalgic about the innocent time when my kids still watched cartoon Dora. I do think that the targetgroup for this movie is very narrow. It is best suited for families who watched the cartoon Dora in the past and now have kids who are a bit more grown up. Everybody else should skip this movie.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
204,antwalt,Lots of fun,6,3 October 2019,"My 7 year old and family really enjoyed this. The humor throughout was great, really enjoyed the first half hour. Felt a little long towards the final act, but whatever age, solid entertainment.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

206,mathiashannes,"This was fun, really!",7,17 February 2021,This movie laughs with itself in just the right way. It takes guts to create something like this. Had fun all the way.,Dora and the Lost City of Gold
207,juliaruskauff,Loved it,10,14 September 2019,This was like reliving my childhood. It's a really funny movie with some hilarious comments from Dora's parents. Dora's a boss lady who doesn't care about what anybody thinks of her and just does her thing. They even included some nice content from the cartoon.,Dora and the Lost City of Gold
208,wizecrakz,"Wow,...what did they do to this movie!",2,12 August 2019,"It started out funny and really good. It went in a great direction like how the new Jumanji stayed relevant to these times but then it just went bizarre. Eugenio Derbez is a horrible actor too so it made it worse. My family loved Dora growing up and they could have really made this funny. Isabela Monera is always fantastic. She carries this movie but unfortunately the bad acting, lack of adult humor and realistic storyline makes this movie impossible.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
209,fistoutzis,Holy dough,10,2 April 2020,"Dora and the lost City of treasure is the best movie ever made. My favourite scene is when they dance in the end.

211,haileem-06155,dora,8,23 November 2020,This movie when i first saw the trailer and the cover i was like oh man this rey be childish but soon as a i watched it.. it was good i learned to always be yourself no matter what and take risk its worth it dont be scared its a one shot chance. I 100% recommend this movie.,Dora and the Lost City of Gold
212,katydeltakappa,Lighthearted and lol funny,10,9 August 2019,My 16 year old was a huge Dora fan when she was little so I've seen a lot of episodes. This poked fun at the cartoon while still creating a unique feel. My youngest didn't get the inside jokes but still loved the adventure and quirky characters. We all left the movie with a huge smile. I highly recommend this for families that have a sense of humor and don't take life so seriously.,Dora and the Lost City of Gold
213,meryltlk,I'm over 70 and LOVED this film!,8,26 August 2020,"I guess from the comments that this was originally animated, and frankly, I could have done without the animated critters, but obviously needed for the kids used to seeing this animated. --but this was a delightful adventure, and as a theatrical designer, the sets and special effects were INCREDIBLE! The temple, the trap openings, hidden clues ,etc. were marvelous-- also saw the other film, ""the Legend of the Hidden Temple-- that too was well-done--both perfect fare for an easy , lazy summer night!",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
214,deviah-248-74953,GREAT FUN,8,9 August 2019,"I saw this movie at a special screening at the Smithsonian zoo last month, and was probably just among a handful of adults in a theatre filled with kids.I went simply because I was invited and wasn't looking forward to anything spectacular.Guess what? The movie surprised me because I enjoyed every minute of it. But that was nothing compared to the enthusiasm of the kids who simply whooped and cheered throughout.Take your kids to see it. The locations and specvial effects are pretty spectacular, this deserves a big-screen viewing.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
215,Shaene-512-745429,This is a comedy gem!,10,16 August 2019,"This movie is delightful! It's good as a kids' action movie, but it really shines in the family comedy department. You don't even need kids to enjoy it. But watch at least one episode of _Dora the Explorer_, and you'll have an even better time at the film.Overall, performances were great, writing was fun (mildly predictable in some areas, total surprises in comedic areas), and I don't think you could do a better adaptation of the TV show.Thanks for giving our family such a fun and positive film!",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
216,waltandgayle,So fun and enjoyable for all ages!,10,24 November 2019,"This movie was just wonderful. I enjoyed it , my 22 year old enjoyed it, my 34 year old enjoyed it and so did my 3 grandkids ages 7, 9 and 11 year old. There were so many laughable parts. Some where we couldn't stop laughing.
You won't be disappointed!",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
217,ebonflow-85471,Surprisingly enjoyable,7,8 June 2020,"My 3.5 y/o has been watching Dora cartoons a lot lately and they really get on my nerves, so I thought I'd see if she'd enjoy the movie because I figured it at least couldn't be as repetitive and annoying as the show, not only did it not drive me nuts I actually found it to be quite enjoyable and pretty funny.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
218,omargamal-52905,Kids movie,2,13 February 2020,"I advise u if ur above 10 DO not watch this movie, it's cool for a child and definitely not for some one who is 21 💔☺✌",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
219,ntinoskostas-30035,Very nice. Better than most thought to be,8,1 December 2019,"I believe that it could have been better but definitely they can't make a better sequel! I am expecting this movie since its been announced because Isabella Merced is one of my favourite young actress. I think the way they presented the fantastic (animation) world of Dora with ""real"" world is the best they could. The sense of humour isn't too childish so it's for all ages. Also, they took advantage many ""animation"" Dora's lines to make it better and funnier. Good job!!",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
220,realjureduh,Disney take notes,10,18 January 2020,Nickelodeon did an awsome job by doing this live-action update movie. It was full of humor that made me laugh out loud and to put Isabela Moner as the lead was defenitly the right desicion.,Dora and the Lost City of Gold
221,kennydobkins,Way better than expected.,10,15 December 2019,"I expected Dora the Explorer, but I got much more. A movie for all ages, humor for adults, adventure, plot twists. Its sweet, funny, and well made with a dedicated cast willing to do embarrassing things without shame with the message that learning and appreciating cultures is more important than exploiting them for potential wealth. My kids(and I) learned a lot and enjoyed it as well.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

224,u2_ace,Terrible,1,15 August 2019,This is simple: any movie starring Eugenio Derbez cannot be taken for good. It's a shame because the rest of the cast is good. The story is just terrible.,Dora and the Lost City of Gold
225,nhall-8,Great fun with the kids,7,13 July 2020,"Since my kids had grown up with Dora, I had seen a fair few episodes and this movie had a very tongue in cheek attitude to them. It was great fun and an easy watch with great performance from the star.
My only gripe would be the fox, which although in the cartoons was a bit too silly in the movies.

I liked following the storyline and it isn't a shabby one! Didn't expect much in the starting but somehow I was glued till the ending. Characters are well portrayed and not really overdone much. Yes if you are a kid and/or seen the cartoon you may enjoy much more but I liked it anyway. Give it try. You might too!,Dora and the Lost City of Gold
240,helenthebanker,Great film for the whole family!,7,16 August 2019,"Not sure why this has such a bad rating. Both kids (5 and 8) loved it. My husband and I (much to our surprise!) also found it funny - I was in hysterics on many occasions!The acting was great, plot well put together and in my humble opinion the comedic edge brings the adults in to the movie. There's a slight mickey take of the Dora cartoon, which will speak to those of us who have sat through the high pitched, ultra zany episodes.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
241,ladybugz613-230-471608,Funnier than I expected,8,30 August 2020,"I'm 64 and hated Dora when my kids and grandkids watched it. I swore that if I heard ""backpack, backpack!"" one more time I would scream. Then I saw a preview that looked interesting, so on a whim I checked it out.So, so funny! I'd say the target audience is older kids who will get the jokes targeting the animated series, and the adults who were forced to watch with them. Dora is adorable and the cringeworthy moments she experiences when forced to leave the jungle and go to a high school were pretty great. That she is the one to solve the puzzles when tossed back into the jungle is a given. Sort of like a soft-serve Indiana Jones.I got my husband to watch it with me again, and he laughed a lot, too. We both gave it an 8!",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

247,jazzonv14,Not a good movie but not the worst,5,18 November 2019,Cast was pretty bad.. Especially Sammy (Madeleine Madden). Isabela Moner isn't bad but the rest of the cast... I don't know... I didn't expect much before watch and I was right. Anybody can watch it.,Dora and the Lost City of Gold
248,james-1053,Super film for the kids,10,26 December 2019,"Wonderful fillm. Didn't take itself seriously and good nods to the animated series. Great morals for the kids. Mine three (8, 5 and 3) all loved it.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
249,wannabemeever,"First review, because it was too good",9,14 June 2020,"Now when i tell you this is a Good movie i really meant it.Im 21 watching this with my friends (also 21)Constantly laughing and anticipating the next moves. Any movie in my book where i watch the entire film deserves average rates. Why with as much fun i had watching this. I choose to give it 9/10.Now keep in my i was watching this more ironicly then i should have. Some points made me stand up and say is this in a kid movie?!?Perfect lenght on the movie aswell.This was one of those movies that could easily have a 26 Year old actress to potray a high schooler, instead we got someone Who fits the role Perfectly and is only a few years older than the character. Not to mention the actress has played the voice before.Loved it and would for sure watch a sequel",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
250,nikjohn-52371,Can you say Dora you are brilliant?,10,21 August 2019,"Surprisingly very good, took the kids last weekend and prepared to poke hot pokers through my eyes ...but no this is very good ...kids loved it (did have to help the six year old with the sub titles) but myself and hubby were blown away ... This is what kids films should be like ...lots for us to laugh and enjoy ..reminded me a little of the Goonies ...normally when we leave my kids ask for the dvd if they have enjoyed it ..this time it was straight to ...mummy will they make another and can we see it??",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
251,a_man_called_martyn,Most surprising movie of the summer,8,7 September 2019,"The movie is a lot better than you might think for being a live action adaption of a children's cartoon. Its perfect that the movie doesn't take itself to seriously and can poke at itself and its heroine in a good natured way.
The plot of the film may draw inspiration from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which won't matter to any child watching this. Isabela Moner is perfect as Dora. Her wide eyed wonder at the world and sunny disposition is quite joyous. It would be fun to see more of her in the role of Dora. I'd love to see a sequel. So far being to see this movie 5 times its just so much fun. I can't recommend it enough.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
252,theschultz,I'm old,9,11 November 2019,"So we started watching this with the kids but they have attention span. So my husband and I watched it and laughed a lot!

We own it now and will watch it many more times. Good job! I did laugh a lot!",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
253,emmie8198,Unexpectedly Great!,10,10 August 2019,"I thought the trailer looked cute and I wanted to watch something lighthearted. It was actually so entertaining, great for kids and the grandpa sitting in the same row as me in the theater clearly loved it (he laughed so much!). It honored the original cartoon in several scenes that I didn't expect, but also didn't mind. It was a really sweet movie, and kind of like Indiana Jones but with teens and comedy and more kid friendly. The acting was also good in my opinion, though they have to make some things more obvious for children to understand. All around, I think everything was done well. If they make a sequel, I would totally go see it!!",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
254,gmurp,Unoriginal,1,4 September 2019,"I actually haven't seen the movie. The one star comes from the lack of originally that the entire idea of ""a Dora movie"" brings. Can't people just make new and awesome stuff?",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
255,johannesb-69504,"Nice for youngsters to watch, painful for teens or adults",3,28 September 2019,Movie has a couple of funny moments but really only suitable for young kids as the story has a completely unrealistic full of holes storyline and elements that make no logical sense.

I was completely wrong and the entire time I wanted to leave and regretted going. The movie was extremely boring and mostly cringey.

Now, as older elementary students, they had a blast at this movie, and I did too. I thought the talking Swiper was weird, but it was one of my son's favorite parts. This movie was about being positive and being yourself, and the movie boldly said, 'I'm not going to try to be something I'm not.' It was entertaining and fun, and my kids came out singing and dancing. Isn't that the point? With so many violent and intense movies these days, this proved a refreshing change.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

Passed the 6 laugh test, it cleverly broke the fourth wall and kept in theme of the cartoon version whilst offering something fresh as a live action film.

284,mattiful475,Really Enjoyed it!!,8,9 August 2019,"I went with my girlfriend and her 2 nieces. Haven't seen what I'd consider a ""kids"" movie in a while so I was a little reluctant. It was a great movie! Tons of comedy for both kids and adults. They did a great job of blending the comedy together. Only complaint would be lack of swiper but you didn't really notice that until they brought him back. Really enjoyed this movie and parents won't be bored",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
285,mannyer11,I hate Dora the explorer...and yet this makes it ok...,9,26 April 2020,"So my issue with the cartoon is (and bare with me, I am an adult), watching it with my kid, it's general annoying 4th wall break with mind numbing-ness just grates on me. But somehow, this film not only makes me believe a teenager could be a tomb raider, but pokes fun at everything wrong with DTE whilst making it really enjoyable. At times is a parody of itself (especially when they go through the giant flowers) and also throws enough nods to adults where it almost acknowledges how some parents may feel when the cartoon is on. Great job!",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

Loved the singing and dancing especially at the end. In fact because it was only us in the theater, my daughter got up and was dancing along. It was goofy but the action was good. And it wouldn't be Dora without Boots and Swiper. The fiesta trio made an appearance at the end too!",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

291,reenfield,"A fun movie, more enjoyable than it has any right to be",8,14 August 2019,"I found this movie genuinely funny and interesting, I was impressed time and time again during the movie! People rating this very low obviously are missing a spark of joy in their lives to not have enjoyed this even a bit. The movie set up points and followed through!
I think that the audience is young adults who grew up with Dora, I'm 21 and I saw it with college friends and we laughed out loud at so many scenes. It's at it's core a kids movie so don't expect it to be your favorite movie ever but it is funnier and more interesting than it has any right to be. There are cringy moments, of course, it's about a cringy time in a person's life, high school. I was so impressed though at how it handled it's messages, not hitting you over the head like a lot of kids movies these days.
It's not the most original and some of the set pieces can look out of place and some parts are just hard to watch but it is very fun and definitely worth some time.
Overall I'd say go in with no expectations and get taken for a fun ride. Recapture some of your youthful enjoyment of movies where plot points are hidden in plain sight and you feel like youre putting the story together with Dora and her friends.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold

293,carinacaldwell,Surprisingly enjoyable,10,12 August 2019,"My 8 and 10 year old thought ""no way I want to see a Dora movie,"" but then they saw the trailer and thought it looked funny and cute so we got two friends and saw it opening night. They all totally loved it and I enjoyed it way more than I expected to. The themes/jokes were cheesy but the writers knew that and played off it to make it even funnier. My six year old did not get most of the jokes because many of them were about why Dora was cheesy and/or about being awkward and a teenager.I am pretty careful about what we watch and this was definitely family friendly and appropriate for all ages. Two thumbs up!",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
294,jrockamil,Really Enjoyable!!!,10,16 August 2019,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I totally expected to this to let down my expectations I had from watching the previews. I am 42 my youngest daughter

295,emdiski,This is How Kids' Movies Should be Made,9,16 August 2019,"With four kids ranging from 7-22, I have seen a LOT of kids' movies. And after a while they start to feel the same, tired jokes, intentional and contrived ""over their heads"" references that parents are supposed to really appreciate, and all too often some sort of ham-handed and out of place modern morality message that invariably falls flat and comes across as entirely gratuitous and painfully forced.Dora is exceptional in that it almost entirely avoids all those tired formulaic approaches, replacing them instead with a very fun, upbeat, and engaging story that doesn't try to be anything more than that. And it succeeds wildly. This film is clearly not a great work of art nor powerful social message platform...it's just wonderful, unadulterated entertainment for children.The casting was really terrific as well, and Isabella Moner as Dora could not possibly have been better. What a delightful talent she is, and the indefatigable positivity of the character actually feels genuine...this kid all but glows through the whole movie. All in all a real surprise, and probably my favorite kids' movie in several years. Nice job Nickelodeon et al, Iet's hope Disney takes notes on how NOT to turn a potentially fun children's movie into a self-indulgent mess!",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
296,kata-38101,Unfunny braindead cringe-fiesta,1,24 May 2020,"Wouldn't recommend it to any functioning human being. Not for kids, not for adults.

300,fionalochrin,Way more enjoyable than I expected!,8,13 June 2020,I have a 16yr old who used to adore Dora.... my 9 yr old has never seen an episode but we sat down together today and watched this. I'm genuinely surprised by how much I laughed and smiled throughout it. The nods to the original animated series are brilliant and one particular scene with Dora and her parents close to the start of the film had me in stitches! A great rainy day family view for sure!,Dora and the Lost City of Gold
301,wallen-47178,Definitely better than expected,10,7 December 2019,"My daughter loved Dora as a wee child. The humor was good, and they pucked the best actress to play Dora. Its fun and light and a good movie to watch with kids and laugh. PLEASE do a sequel.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
302,supreee,A movie that exists,3,25 August 2019,"You can probably ignore the rating that I'm giving this movie, and you can go see it anyway. Of course this is assuming that you enjoy scenes where they stretch out the joke for about 20 seconds long in the scene and make it unfunny, actors that aren't actually trying half the time, twist villains that have beyond poor execution, annoying characters, and disgusting CGI. Do you like long awkward scenes where the characters stare at nothing? Well if you do it's your lucky day because the director decided to jam around 10 of those in the movie! Oops, I almost forgot to mention how the character development doesn't exist and basically amounts to the characters saying ""We're friends now,"" at some point during the movie. A third of the cast is good but the other two thirds are not. Also Boots looks like an eldritch abomination I seriously don't know who green-lighted this design.You should probably wait until this becomes available at home. At least there you won't get interrupted by the 15 year old girls two rows in the back singing along or the 6 year old loudly explaining the joke to his mother directly after the scene ends.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
303,angelavanessae,i enjoyed it.,6,10 August 2019,"I surprisingly enjoyed the movie more than i firstly expected. Isabela Moner did a fantastic job portraying the character as Dora, it it was awesome. She keep me entertained throughout the movie, has my attention.The visual effect in this movie was kinda bad in my opinion :( it looks too faked for my eye, and i waa hoping it could have been done better, since this is a kid movie.
A teenage version of dora definitely makes an interesting movie, with lots of reference from the cartoon! I grew up watching Dora a lot, and this truly makes me feel nostalgic.",Dora and the Lost City of Gold
