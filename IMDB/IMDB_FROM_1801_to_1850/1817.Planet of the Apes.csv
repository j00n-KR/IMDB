0,MartinHafer,This film needs no remake!,9,11 July 2006,"Apart from the cheesy ape prosthetics, this was a nearly perfect sci-fi movie that had absolutely no reason to remake it other than to make a fast buck! Nothing about the remake can beat many of the wonderful lines or scenes from the movie. Taylor yelling ""Get your hands off me, do damned, dirty apes!"" and ""This is a MADHOUSE---a MADHOUSE!!"" are classic lines and I also love the scene during Taylor's trial when the orangutans are sitting in the SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL, SPEAK NO EVIL poses! These are some of the greatest moments in film history and yet some moron wants a remake?!? The movie, despite having several writers come and go (including Rod Serling), is well scripted, directed and who could have done a better job than Charleton Heston or Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter? The film is creative, energetic and concludes with one of the most visually impressive scenes in sci-fi history. All these combine for a great film. PERIOD!",Planet of the Apes
1,TheLittleSongbird,Simply brilliant!,9,2 May 2010,"This film is absolutely wonderful, much better than the uninspired Tim Burton re-imagining(that saddened me as I like Burton, well his early movies anyway). This though is the real deal, much better told in terms of story, and the script is clever and sly. Planet of the Apes certainly looks good, the special effects and cinematography are excellent for their time, and the ape make up is simply marvellous. And of course the twist ending still delights(and shocks). And I think the acting is good, with Charlton Heston appropriately square jawed in one of his more interesting film roles and as the apes Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter really do shine. The direction is engaging and focused as well, and the score is terrific. The film may start a little slow, but that is nothing compared to how pedestrian the whole of the 2001 film was. Overall, simply brilliant. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Planet of the Apes
2,bkoganbing,"""Human See, Human Do""",9,25 August 2013,"On a mission in space Charlton Heston and his crew get a fast forward courtesy of a 'time bend' and they wind up hundreds of years in the future. And on a planet where evolution has reversed a step. It's the apes that are the species created in the image of the Creator and humans are at best entertaining and at worse a lower form of animal that threatens the existence of Simian Civilization.As Heston so aptly puts it he thinks he's arrived in a mad house. Two simian scientists, Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowell have true scientific curiosity and want to know more about this human with articulate speech. But they answer to Maurice Evans who acts more like the high priest of simian religion and will do anything to protect the orthodoxy of his faith.Sounds familiar, doesn't it? As is true in human religions on earth, those in charge have power over the true believers and will do anything to protect their privileged position. The apes haven't done anything different, it's what is driving Charlton Heston quite out of his mind.My favorite in this film is Maurice Evans and seeing him in that orangutan costume and makeup and hearing that classically trained voice come from same is a treat that keeps on treating every time you see this film and the sequel films that he did appear in. Today's audience cannot appreciate the familiar voices of people like Evans, McDowell, Hunter, James Whitmore and James Daly who are in ape costume, but even so the makeup remains a marvel.In fact it got Planet Of The Apes its only Oscar and well deserved. In the past you simply would put some actor in a gorilla costume in some B and lower grade feature, but it was never convincing. The actors here look like simians and must have rehearsed for weeks to get simian movements down as well as they do.In the end Heston goes off to meet his destiny and the destiny that met mankind while he was asleep and time bended. Planet Of The Apes is as fresh as it was when it arrived on the big screen in 1968 and with a lot of the same lessons to be learned.",Planet of the Apes
3,Leofwine_draca,A cornerstone of sci-fi cinema,8,9 October 2016,"Ah, here it is: one of the cornerstones of science fiction films, the behemoth of the 'shipwrecked survivors explore an alien world' movies. PLANET OF THE APES. One of those films (the other is SUPERMAN) that, somewhat criminally, I hadn't got around to watching in my long years of being a cinema fan. Well, that's now corrected, and I'm glad, because PLANET OF THE APES is a great movie that fully deserves its hype.In many ways it looks and feels like an extended episode of TV's STAR TREK, which is inevitable, as it was made in the same era and with the same 'look' in front of the camera. However, it has a far more in depth script than one of those episodes, and as much as I hate to say it, Charlton Heston is by far a more convincing actor than William Shatner! Heston takes the likable hero role here and runs away with it, delivering a grizzled, sinewy turn as a man who finds himself out of his depth when he's stranded on a world run by apes.Of course, plenty of political intrigue and machinations follow, along with the tried-and-tested escape-and-get-captured formula that sustain many an easy-viewing Sunday afternoon flick. Particularly of note is the stunning photography, which really brings those isolated locales to life in the first half hour, and the excellent ape costumes which give life and character to each of the simian species. Along the way, the script has time for a little romance, plenty of humour, some nicely quotable lines, and even a couple of twists, not least the famous ending which, although long since spoiled by now, still packs a punch in the same way as the one in THE SIXTH SENSE.PLANET OF THE APES is hugely influential and a lot of fun from beginning to end. It deserves its status as a sci-fi classic thanks to the inherent sense of fun and discovery along the way, factors which have made a success of every sci-fi creation: whether they be the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs or the early films of George Lucas.",Planet of the Apes
4,SnoopyStyle,Sci-fi icon,9,7 September 2014,"George Taylor (Charlton Heston), John Landon, Stewart and Dodge are astronauts on a near light speed spacecraft. After around 18 months in hibernation, they crash land on an unfamiliar planet. The year outside is 3978 AD around 2000 years after launch. Stewart is dead. The three survivors escape the sinking craft with almost no supplies. Primitive humanoids with no language steal their supplies and clothing. They are also raiding a corn field. Then they are set upon by a hunting party of apes.The apes don't show up until 35 minutes. When they do show up on horseback, it becomes movie history. The story is compelling to the bitter end. Charlton Heston has his John Wayne swagger. He is the big American iconic superior man. Sci-fi had an interesting run in the 60s and this is definitely part of it. Then there is the ape makeup. That's the biggest danger of this movie. It could have gone terribly wrong. However for its time, the makeup is done very well. The mouth moves a little. The main ape characters can show some emotions. This is a well made sci-fi icon.",Planet of the Apes
5,Hitchcoc,Too Many Questions,7,4 October 2001,"This reminds me of an extended Twilight Zone episode. It is remarkable to look at. In it's day, the makeup was state of the art. I remember reading an article in Life magazine about the incredible amount of time it took to get the actors ready. Also, the whole premise of an evolutionary inversion is provocative. Chuck Heston is quite good. If you totally suspend science and disbelief, this is entertaining. I like the movie, so I'm not going to dismiss it, but there are things that bother me. Why does everyone speak the same English, despite centuries of syntactic aberrations and other languages. When Heston yells out, ""Get you hands off me, you filthy ape,"" he is understood and then he becomes conversant with Kim Hunter and her associates. Why are the humans considered animals, yet they have the skills to clothe and support themselves. The monkey jokes (actually, I didn't see any monkeys). ""Human see, human do."" It doesn't wash. Why is the young girl attractive and dressed modestly? Who made her clothes? I guess she's just a sexual object, and you wouldn't want someone covered with dirt and leaves in her hair who doesn't smell too good. I wonder if she belongs to the NRA. I know. It's a satire. Get a sense of humor. But to be good sci fi, there should be some effort made to account for these issues.Still, it's a cute movie. It has a conclusion that explains what happened to the human race (although they are technically still there). I guess I won't ask any more questions. That way I'll feel less disappointed. I saw this film the day it came out. I was younger then and I really got a kick out of it.",Planet of the Apes
6,Prismark10,The torch bearer,9,26 March 2015,"Apparently the original novel that the film is based on is not very good. Rod Serling and Michael Wilson has fashioned the story to turn it into an allegory as well as a satire on race relations and religion. It also has a pointed anti nuclear strand which has a big impact in its twist ending.I first watched this film as a kid and only watched the last few minutes of the film where the film ends at the beach with Charlton Heston in shock and dismay.Heston is Taylor a misanthropic astronaut in a four person crew on a long term space mission to deep space that crash lands in what seems a deserted planet. Given that they will never return to earth and may have to breed among themselves, its never explains why there were three males and one female!Because of cloud cover they have difficulties in tracking their whereabouts in space and soon run into They run into other humans who seem to be hunter and gatherers and unable to speak. However they are attacked by apes on horseback and they do speak and speak English.The humans are treated like animals in a zoo and Taylor is captured but as he suffered a throat injury he is unable to speak at first. However a female ape who is a zoologist and her fiancé are intrigued by him and then shocked when he speaks. However he is also seen as a threat to other apes who have reason to be wary of humans and the answer to this mystery lies in the forbidden zone.The movie raises a lot of points. Ranging from how we treat animals to race relations in the USA at the time and the reverence to sacred scriptures. Taylor being able to talk and think is against what the apes have been taught.The film still has a power to provoke and entertain. Heston who in several films played 'the last man on earth' does come across as rather fruity in his acting. I think it would had been better if he was more humanised here. Its Roddy McDowell as Cornelius and Kim Hunter as Zira who play the apes who come across as more human.There is some good location shooting in remote parts of Utah but the production design in the studio now looks cheap and basic, almost like an episode of Star Trek.The film spawned several sequels which were inferior and a 2001 remake that was misjudged. There have been several better prequels but the original film is still the master.",Planet of the Apes
7,mark.waltz,Welcome to the mad house! It's a mad house!,10,24 January 2020,"Yes, there's plenty to laugh at (or with) in this brilliant science fiction film that at over 50 years old now means more to me than when I first saw it on TV back in the mid 1970's. It's also a brilliant commentary on the state of a dying world as seen through the author (Pierre Boulle) and later the filmmakers, lead by director Franklin J. Schaffner. Even with the four initial sequels and unnecessary remakes (and sequels to those), it is a classic, and a brilliant example of cinematic achievement in entertaining, educating and enlightening.In 1968, the heavy masks and make-up work were highly acclaimed, but this film is so much more than that. I haven't seen this film in more than 20 years, and there is so much more meaning now. Charlton Heston gives a strong, noble performance as Taylor, an astronaut so disillusioned with his world that he signs on as captain of a voyage that is intended to take him into the future. It's more than he bargains for as he ends up on a planet several thousand years ago where English speaking simians are in charge and the only understanding he can find are from chimpanzee scientists Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter, and the mute Linda Harrison whom he nicknames Nova. In a strong role as the high ranking orangutan, Maurice Evans knows more than he's willing to reveal, wise but ruthless, yet withThe court shows the three orangutans in charge doing the hear no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil pose, creating a new laugh for me for a visual that I hadn't noticed before. It's monkey tongue in cheek (""Human see, human do"" is one obvious cliche that comes out), but the laughs cease immediately when Evans makes his final revelation. James Whitmore's voice is recognizable behind the heavy mask as Evans' colleague. However, the heart and soul of the film's moral is the beautifully sweet Kim Hunter who sees something instantly in Heston's ""Bright Eyes"" and becomes convinced that there's something more to humans than just the uncivilized jungle people she has been used to dealing with. McDowall is initially cynical as her archaeologist husband, but their little kisses add a cute and romantic element to the personas of the chimps who obviously fear but hate the apes yet respect the orangutans who are torn between right and wrong in their desire for peace.The first quarter of the film sets up the mood with Heston and his colleagues forced to leave their space rocket, leaving behind a beautiful colleague who aged rapidly because of air in her bed chamber. The mystery of the planet they land on may be clear to first time viewers as they pick up clues, so the ending will not be a surprise to them, but to others, it came as a shock, and ends the film on a very grim note. The sets of the simian camps look like they came out of Dante's Inferno. I can forgive the fact that a sequel was inevitable because there was so much more in this story to tell.",Planet of the Apes
8,classicsoncall,"""You know what they say, human see, human do.""",8,11 January 2007,"I can't say for sure why it took so long to get around to watching this film, I was around for it's original theatrical release in 1968. Perhaps it was for what some modern day viewers would consider cheesy special effects and men in monkey suits. But you know, the movie tosses around a host of thought provoking concepts, and challenges your perception of things by standing them on their head. Scenes are cleverly done, even when accompanied by the cliché-iest of clichés. As he did in 'The Twilight Zone' TV series of the early 1960's, Rod Serling lends his creative vision to a hodge podge mix of ideas like racial tolerance, equality, animal rights, and the 'insidious theory of evolution'. Thrown right into the middle of it all is Charlton Heston as a stranded astronaut on a planet ruled by apes who lord it over a subject race of mute humans. There's enough of the TV 'Star Trek' influence here as well, as the movie came out right in the middle of that show's run. The only way I can think of to make it better would have been to have Heston's character pick up from memory the reading of the '29th Scroll, 6th Verse' of the Apes' scientific discovery, like Captain Kirk did in the 'We The People' episode of his series. That would have blown Dr. Zaius' (Maurice Evans) mind well beyond Taylor's (Heston) ability to speak in plain English, ape talk, whatever.Some time ago I started watching the 2001 remake of the movie by Tim Burton, and had to turn it off at about midway, I was just too bored to stay with it. Just another example supporting the idea that you shouldn't tamper with the original, probably true of almost every film ever made. Still though, whenever I try to make sense of the whole time/space/speed of light connection and try to reconcile it with the idea of suspended aging it makes my head hurt. Just watch the film with some suspension of disbelief of your own and you'll only age about two hours in the process.",Planet of the Apes
9,gavin6942,Apes and Man... Together,7,25 April 2011,"George Taylor (Charlton Heston) and his crew go into stasis while their space ship transports them 300 light years from Earth... and they land on a planet that is not very hospitable to mankind.This film is clearly a classic, with several sequels and a remake. Unfortunately, it loses something by the fact it has entered popular culture. Anyone who sees it probably knows the full story before the first frame, which ruins any surprise there may be.The message of the film seems clear, that mankind treats animals poorly. But is that the message? It certainly does not make a pure analogy. Our apes do not speak and such. If the message was one of science and evolution against religion, well, that is another story...The movie gets praise for its costumes, and I agree they are not bad, but they have such terrible mouth movements... I do like Heston talking about the ""hot and eager help"" they would provide their female companion. (Strangely, the film treats female ape Dr. Zira with respect, but the female humans are seen as little more than breeding tools.) Sadly, Roddy McDowell is hidden under a mask... he recommended to his companions in makeup that they should frequently add tics, blinks and assorted facial gestures to add a sense of realism and keep the makeup from appearing ""mask-like"". McDowall reportedly became a merry prankster with the makeup, driving home with his make-up on, and shocking some of the other drivers on the freeway. I still would rather have seen his face.",Planet of the Apes
10,lee_eisenberg,"Get your hands off this movie, you damn dirty remake!",10,20 March 2006,"It's especially interesting that ""Planet of the Apes"" was released a few months before ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", as they both look at the same question: what will become of humanity (and how did we originate)? Obviously, the really famous line is Charlton Heston's snap at his captors, and the really famous scene is the end - which I won't tell here for fear of spoiling the whole movie. And what an impressive movie it is! Unfortunately, I can't say the same for Tim Burton's remake. ""POTA"" should never have been remade. So, for a cinematic treat, stick to this one and avoid the remake.One more thing is that some people have pointed out that the portrayals of the simians were kinda racist. The blond, cultured orangutans are the nobles; the dark-haired, mildly nervous chimpanzees are the scientists; and the dark-skinned, incompetent gorillas are the police. Oh well. It's still a good movie.",Planet of the Apes
11,jboothmillard,Planet of the Apes,9,7 May 2006,"I first saw the Tim Burton remake, I think it's alright, and then I saw this original version from director Franklin J. Schaffner (Patton). George Taylor (Ben-Hur's Charlton Heston) is an astronaut thinking he and his team are returning to Earth, but they crash in a forbidden land somewhere else. When they do come across civilisation, one is killed and Taylor and his friend taken prisoner by talking apes! When captured Taylor was shot in the neck, so he can't speak. While in prison though he befriends and interests Dr. Zira (A Matter of Life and Death's Kim Hunter). On the planet all humans are dumb and can't think, but Zira believes this ""creature"" is unique when she learns he can write. She convinces her fiancé Cornelius (Fright Night's Roddy McDowall) eventually too. After a long while Taylor does speak a great movie line, and the apes including Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) are sort of afraid of him, and they have a court case to debate his existence as a superior human being. The ending of the film is the most disturbing (almost like Burton's), when Taylor discovers he was on Earth all along, and you see the Statue of Liberty in the sand. Also starring Linda Harrison as Nova. Heston, with special effects make-up covered McDowall and Hunter make fantastic performances, and it is a fantastic futuristic film with a witty and clever script that grips you all the way, it definitely deserves to be in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Costume Design, Best Music for Jerry Goldsmith and an Honorary Award for John Chambers (make up). It was number 18 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was number 66 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Get your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty ape."") and it was number 59 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!",Planet of the Apes
12,rmax304823,"Man See, Man Do.",7,30 November 2008,"Charlton Heston is the only survivor of a space expedition that has crashed on a planet some millions of light years from earth, and thus some 2,000 years in the future. He stumbles into a rude civilization in which apes rule, while the tribes of speechless humans are treated as wild animals and periodically rounded up for experimentation or extermination. Heston is wounded in the throat during his capture and is rendered mute like the others. Since he demonstrates signs of intelligence, he is singled out for behavioral examination and kept in a cage with a female of the species. The apes argue over whether he actually has brains or is simply aping his betters. When he regains his speech, it upsets everyone's view of life as it should be, as it's written down in the ""scrolls"" by the ""law giver."" His chief enemy is an orang-utan played by Maurice Evans. With the help of two enlightened scientific chimpanzees, Kim Hunter and Roddy MacDowell, he manages to escape with his Significant Other, only to discover that he has landed back on earth, whence he came, but that a war has destroyed humankind and left an ecological vacuum that has been filled by the great apes.Actually, the movie runs along three parallel tracks. One is the unraveling of the mystery of how the apes came to be superior to humans, and the moral behind the puzzle. A second involves the internal dissent among the apes, pitting those who scoff at the idea of man and culture, and those who believe Heston and want to see him saved and set free. The third is a running commentary on Western culture circa 1967, the era of flower power and hippies and rebellious youth and disgruntled, resentful elders clinging to old concepts. I discount the relationship between Heston and the young lady, since she doesn't speak and was in real life the mistress of the producer, Richard Zanuck.It all may seem a little preachy now, and in some respects incomprehensible to those who don't remember the tumultuous 1960s. The morphed wisecracks are still amusing though. ""Don't trust anyone over thirty."" Will the youngsters get that? Will they get Maurice Evans' speech before the Council of Three, which alludes twice to the Declaration of Independence and once each to Alexander Pope and George Orwell? Probably not. The apes seem to be getting righter all the time.There are other instructive evocations of current social dynamics. On Planet Ape, the lighter you are, the better off you are. The buff orang-utans are the aristocratic leaders. The grayish chimpanzees are their middle-class intellectuals and technicians, rather like today's nerds. The black gorillas are the grunts. They do all the wet work. They're the guards and the police force and the flunkies and the shoe-shine boys. An interesting remark by Heston in a commentary on the film: the three simian strata subjected themselves to voluntary segregation. The separate species hung out together, ate lunch together, and though they showed no evident hostility towards the others, they clearly preferred their own kind. Is this movie telling us more than we need or want to know? Shouldn't a sociologist find this as disturbing as Heston finds the wreck of the Statue of Liberty? Except for Charlton Heston, there's no acting worth commenting on. The others are buried in carefully designed make up. They can only project the most rudimentary expressions -- a slight frown, a weak smile -- and their voices could have easily been dubbed. Every actor, down to the extras, underwent this lengthy and elaborate disguise. Later versions of the tale, as the concept became degraded and decadent, saved time and money by giving the lesser performers simple rubber masks.They probably could have lowered the budget on this initial entry by using cheaper techniques. Few people would have noticed, and, really, the story is determinedly middle-brow, like Rod Serling's simple sermons on the excellent ""The Twilight Zone"" series. Not particularly subtle or challenging, the story is what might be called ""thought provoking."" It made scads of money, which accounts for the many sequels and the recent remake. If there's a nickel left to be made out of the franchise we can expect another one any minute.Yet it's an enjoyable movie -- amusing and, well, though provoking. Nice location shooting and imaginative art direction. See it with the kids. Explain to them that ""we hold these truths to be self evident"" is from a charter document, that Pope said ""the proper study of mankind is man,"" and that Orwell wrote ""some are more equal than others."" They'll thank you for it and, with any luck, will climb down from the chandelier.",Planet of the Apes
13,Tweekums,Must see classic sci-fi,9,14 August 2011,There can be few people who haven't seen or at least heard about the final iconic scene from this film but I will endeavour not to spoil it despite it appearing on the DVD cover! In the far future a spacecraft arrives on a distant world from Earth; for the crew only eighteen months have passed but for everybody back home thousands of years have passed. The landing does not go according to plan and the find themselves sinking in a lake. Three of the four astronauts have survived but it doesn't look as if they will live long as it appears to be a desert world. They walk from the crash site and eventually find vegetation and soon after that they find what appears to be a race of primitive mute men. These men aren't the most advanced creatures on the planet though; the apes take that position. The apes capture or kill many of the men along with one of the astronauts. The astronaut Taylor was wounded so can't speak initially but the chimpanzee scientists that are studying him soon realise that he isn't like other men. We soon learn that ape culture has its religious beliefs about its origins and the idea that a man might talk is a heresy; as it the idea that a human civilisation might pre-date the apes; scientists Zera and Cornelius believe it to be true however and escape with Taylor to 'The Forbidden Zone' where he makes a shocking discovery.As this film is over forty years old it is little surprise that the special effects have dated; the ape costumes were Oscar in their day but now look rather primitive; this does not distract from the quality of the story however. The way the apes stubbornly cling to the idea that there was no civilisation before theirs and they did not evolve from earlier primates is a clear reference to how some people still refuse to believe in evolution. The acting was pretty solid; Charlton Heston does a fine job as Taylor and Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall do well under their heavy make up as chimpanzees Zera and Cornelius. If you still haven't seen this classic science fiction I recommend that you do so; it is one of those films that everybody should see at least once.,Planet of the Apes
14,ma-cortes,Classic and energetic science-fiction movie with a terrific Charlton Heston,8,21 July 2008,"This known story is the first and best of the primates series; it starts when Taylor(recently deceased Charlton Heston) and three astronauts crash on a far planet and encounter a culture where the simians rule over. At the start they trek taken across the desert. Later discover humanity has gone awry and now is slave and reduced to beasts. Man is treated as animal of burden and regarded as scum. A couple of gorillas named Cornelius(Roddy McDowall) and Zira(Kim Hunter) think otherwise and even agree Taylor escape, accompanied by a gorgeous native named Nova(Linda Harrison). He's trapped and judged by Dr. Zaius(Maurice Evans) and the president of assembly(James Withmore).This is a classic sci-fi movie with metaphysical significance and reflexion about origin of human being, though also packs action, adventures, intrigue and entertainment. In spite of time, the original energy remains and results to be an agreeable fantasy. Exciting writing credits by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson from Pierre Boulle novel, though the amazing final scripted by Serling. One of the important attributes of this work, is the excellent, spectacular production design by Walter Scott. Glimmer and luminous cinematography by Leon Shamroy. Magnificent make-up by John Chambers, a first-rate expert, such as proved in 'Blade runner, Ssss, Island of Dr Moreau' among others. The picture is fabulously directed by Franklyn J Schaffner, utilizing a great visual sense. The film won two nominations for Academy Award, the best costume and sensational musical score by a top-notch Jerry Golsmith,- Schaffner's usual: Patton, Papillon-, and deservedly won Oscar for make-up by Chambers. Schaffner was an impressive director with hits : 'Boys from Brazil, Papillon, Patton, War lord', but also flops, : 'Lionheart, Island of streams, Nicholas and Alexandra and Sphinx'. Schaffner was one of the most innovate creative minds from the 70s and 80s.Followed by four inferior sequels and a TV series, as 'Beneath of the planet of apes'(70, Ted Post), 'Escape of planet of apes'(71, Don Taylor), 'Conquest of planet of apes'(72, J. Lee Thompson), 'Battle for the planet of apes'(73, J.Lee Thompson).",Planet of the Apes
15,BA_Harrison,Monkey magic.,10,12 June 2010,"Taking Darwin's Theory of Evolution and turning it on its head, this classic slice of 60s sci-fi is visually impressive, thoroughly exciting, and most importantly, extremely thought provoking: not only does it poke fun at organised religion's refusal to accept the whole evolutionary process, but it is also a savage indictment of humanity as a whole, quite correctly identifying us as a violent race destined to destroy ourselves.Charlton Heston stars as US astronaut Taylor, who along with two fellow spacemen, awakens from suspended animation to discover that not only have they overslept a tad (by a couple of thousand years) but have also crash landed on a strange planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are their slaves.Although Heston is undeniably superb in his role as the dumbstruck Taylor struggling to cope with life as an ape's plaything, it is those who play the lead simians that deserve the highest praise of all, acting convincingly beneath John Chambers' impressive iconic monkey make-up. Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter are excellent as Cornelius and Zira, the likable chimpanzee scientists who believe Taylor's story and try to help him escape to freedom, but my favourite character has got to be Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans), the orangutan who hides the truth behind his species' rise to power, tries to have our hero castrated, lobotomises his friend, and accuses Cornelius and Zira of heresy, albeit all for the good of his own race. What a delightfully devious yet strangely admirable man err, I mean ape.It's now been over 40 years since Planet of the Apes was originally released, but it has stood the test of time well, remaining the best of the long running ape series (and infinitely better than Tim Burton's abysmal remake/reimagining) and well deserving of its high praise and 'classic' status (the ending alone is worthy of this accolade: it's one of the finest twists in the history of cinema).",Planet of the Apes
16,moonspinner55,Those damned dirty apes!,7,24 February 2008,"Extraordinarily popular sci-fi adventure based on Pierre Boulle's book, itself followed by numerous sequels, a television spin-off, and a remake in 2001. Astronaut Charlton Heston is caught in a time-warp and returns to Earth far in the future, where intelligent apes are now the superior race. Quite gripping, despite a generally downbeat tone and a wayward adaptation by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling. Heston's clenched jaw serves him well here, and Kim Hunter, Roddy McDowall and Maurice Evans (unrecognizable except for their voices) are each fabulous.

18,Quinoa1984,ITS A MADHOUSE! TERRIFIC CLASSIC!,10,11 June 2000,"I loved this film.  This is probably the film that got Charleton Heston knighted (because he gives his most memorable performance).  This sci-fi classic looks at a post earth period where Charleton Heston returns to find his planet is now ruled by ""damn, dirty"" apes who use humans for experiments.  Very intruiging along the way.  Roddy McDowell is also very good as the head ape who actually may like the human.  Extraordinary (Oscar winning) makeup and a overall goodness in the sci-fi world make this a must see for anyone looking for a good time, and a mandatory watch for any film buff.  Great.  One of the best films of the 60's.  A+",Planet of the Apes
19,ComedyFan2010,A sci fi classic for a reason,10,13 October 2017,"This is a sci fi cult classic for a reason. When watching it I was full into the story and couldn't believe that this amazing movie is already 50 years old.Of course it had elements of it's time. For the most part the big overacting of Charlton Heston. Starting with the dramatic scene in the beginning where he comments on the mission and including his ridiculous laugh a bit later when they were exploring the planet they landed on. But this didn't really bother me and seemed to have ended after a while (or maybe I got used to it). From some of the old movies that I saw this seemed to be a normal acting way back in the days.But other than that the movie is perfect. The costumes and settings are so well done. It is not surprising that they got the Oscar for the costumes. They really looked like apes and when I went through the profiles of the actors in it I couldn't believe that it was them. Was a shocker for me that Zira was played by Kim Hunter, Stella from Streetcar Named Desire. The setting was also done really well giving a great atmosphere to the movie. It gives a few philosophical questions to think about when it comes to society. They were very well incorporated into the story. I first felt frustrated how Dr. Zaius can ignore George Taylor's ability to speak but as the movie progressed and especially at the end I could understand his motives.The ending was epic. Even though I didn't see the movie before I already knew how it ends (hard to avoid that spoiler for all my life and having watched the newly made prequels). Yet it was still an amazing scene that gave me goosebumps and lots of thoughts.",Planet of the Apes
20,wes-connors,Fox Goes Ape,9,6 December 2014,"Sometime in the future, four astronauts from Earth are journeying out of our solar system, to hopefully arrive somewhere habitable (thought to be 300-320 light years from home). Travelling in suspended animation and at or near the speed of light, the crew ages only 18 months in 2,000 years. After crash-landing on a strange planet, the men sadly discover their one female crew-member has expired. Slightly space-crazed leader Charlton Heston (as George Taylor) laments this means missed opportunities for copulation. A crew of two women and two men might have been a better plan. The landing site does not show any obvious signs of life; but, water and the elements suggest life is present. After a hike, Mr. Heston and the men discover they've landed on ""Planet of the Apes""...This marvelous science-fiction story started a monkey money-making franchise. In hindsight, there are some obvious ways to improve the narrative. They should have created an Ape language and used dubbing, for example. It's more believable to consider Heston as smart enough to pick up foreign languages easily; probably, that would have been stipulated in astronauts for this trip. We're also dumbfounded by Heston's inability to show he's fairly intelligent, during his initial captivity. Still, this story is imaginative and thought-provoking. The common reading is that we are to derive some racial parallels to present-day (or, 1968) civilization. Since both astronauts and simians range from blond to black, the racial comparisons are subjugated to deeper comparisons and considerations...John Chambers deservedly won an ""Academy Award"" for his simian make-up design. The ""missing link"" in Chambers' monkey make-up was previewed a week before ""Planet of the Apes"" premiered, in a ""Lost in Space"" TV episode. Therein, Dr. Smith and Don West are sent to a prison planet and meet Michael Conrad (as Creech). He looks like a ""Planet of the Apes"" refugee because the Irwin Allen-produced TV show swiped the facial applications. And, if the voice of teenage chimpanzee Lou Wagner (as Lucius) sounds familiar, he appeared on ""Lost in Space"" as the Spock-eared alien J-5. Also under the fantastic ""Apes"" make-up are Roddy McDowall (as Cornelius), Kim Hunter (as Zira) and Maurice Evans (as Zaius). Their concealed characterizations are most memorable...""Planet of the Apes"" is given an exciting treatment by producer Arthur P. Jacobs, director Franklin J. Schaffner and the crew at Twentieth Century-Fox. Gimmick-free photography by Leon Shamroy makes it look real and Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack compliments everything beautifully. The story was adapted from an original novel by Pierre Boulle. Of course, they changed some important details. For the visual medium, the alterations made a better story. Awareness of comic and pulp science fiction stories comes into play, along with a twist which imaginatively links the simian civilization to the human condition. Thankfully, the changes made by writers Rod Serling and Michael Wilson allowed filmmakers to give ""Planet of the Apes"" one of the best movie endings in all of filmdom.********* Planet of the Apes (2/8/68) Franklin J. Schaffner ~ Charlton Heston, Kim Hunter, Roddy McDowall, Maurice Evans",Planet of the Apes
21,BandSAboutMovies,The beginning,8,29 December 2019,"La Planete des Singes is where Planet of the Apes gets its start. It's the story of three humans who travel from Earth to the star Betelgeuse, where apes are the dominant species. So many of the ideas that appear in the movies come from this book, save the shock ending that all surprise endings yearn to emulate.Let me tell you - Planet of the Apes is beyond Star Wars for some folks. How many other franchises have had so many sequels, two reboots, a TV series and a cartoon?Boulle's literary agent, Allain Bernheim, sold the novel to film producer Arthur P. Jacobs, who once said, ""I wish King Kong hadn't been made so I could make it."" Luckily, he had just the ape project to sell him.Jacobs spent over three years trying to convince someone to make the movie. The screenplay, from Twilight Zone creator Rod Serling, went a long way toward making that happen. He added themes from the Cold War and added the aforementioned twist ending. But with production costs at $10 million - $70 million today - no studio wanted to make it.Jacobs and associate producer Mort Abrahams kept at it and once they got Charlton Heston on board, things started to get rolling. Heston brought director Franklin J. Schaffner (Patton, The Boys From Brazil) on board and for a screen test.This screen test featured Heston, Edward G. Robinson appeared as Dr. Zaius and two then-unknown Fox contract actors - James Brolin and Linda Harrison - who played Cornelius and Zira.It worked and convinced 20th Century Fox to make the film for $5.8 million, which paid off - the film made $22 million.Astronauts Taylor (Heston), Landon and Dodge awake from hypersleep as their ship crashes into an unknown planet. A malfunction has already claimed the life of their crewmate Stewart. As they leave their spacecraft, Taylor notices that they are 2,000 years in the future and on a planet that appears to be a wasteland.Soon, they've been attacked by not only primitive humans but militant apes. Dodge is killed, Taylor is injured and Landon is knocked out. Animal psychologist Zira (Kim Hunter) and surgeon Galen (Wright King, Invasion of the Bee Girls) save Taylor and place him with Nova (Linda Harrison, who for some time renamed herself Augusta Summerland thanks to her spiritual advisor), a gorgeous primitive human.The apes live in a caste system, with gorillas serving as the muscle, orangutans handling religion and government and chimpanzees being involved in medicine and science. Humans are seen as nothing more than animals to be herded and hunted.This all changes for Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Zira when they learn that Taylor can speak. After all, how else would we get such classic lines like ""Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!""Of course, a visit to the Forbidden Zone - a trope that would come back in nearly every post-apocalyptic film ever - we learn that this isn't another planet. It's Earth. It's also the best ending to probably any movie ever made.Two months after this came out, they were already talking sequel. Stay tuned all week - we'll be covering every single film in the series.",Planet of the Apes
22,sunwarrior13,A Charlton Heston Movie That Remains Relevant Today,10,3 April 2016,"The late movie critic Roger Ebert stated that there are three films by Charlton Heston that would be seen by everyone. They are namely: The Ten Commandments,Ben Hur and The Planet Of The Apes. The first two were definitely great epics. But make no mistake about it. The third is obviously a classic. The Mark Wahlberg remake in 2001 only cemented its status.The Planet Of The Apes is a science fiction film that stars Heston together with Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans, James Whitmore, James Daly and Linda Harrison.The screenplay based on the French novel La Planète des Singes by Pierre Boulle.It tells a story of a group of astronauts led by Taylor whose spacecraft crash-land on a strange planet in the distant future.The crew thought of it as a desolate planet but later find themselves in a society of apes that have evolved and have developed human-like qualities.They witness the changes the have occurred as these apes have started to possess attributes similar to humans particularly culture and intelligence.Also,it was worth noticing that the apes have seen humans as lower-level creatures who are wearing animal skin.Taylor tried to know what has happened to humanity.The result was that of despair and anger when he saw the remains of the Statue of Liberty at the beach.It was definitely a film that has stood the test of time especially when it dealt with many issues that the world were facing during the time the film was made such as nuclear war,the environment and slavery.Charlton Heston provides us a great performance as Taylor as he depicted the role of an anti-hero extremely well.The issues that the world was facing in the 60's remains relevant while this review is being written at present so the viewer watching this film will surely appreciate the message it wants to convey.",Planet of the Apes

Has to be.",10,25 July 2011,"Planet of the Apes is directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and adapted to screenplay by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling from the 1963 Pierre Boulle novel La planete des singes. It stars Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans, James Whitmore, James Daly and Linda Harrison. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and Leon Shamroy is the cinematographer.3978 A.D. and a spaceship and its crew crash down on a distant planet. Three astronauts survive the crash, they appear to be on a planet not unlike their own, Earth. But soon they come to learn that this planet is ruled by intelligent apes, the human being is the lesser species, mute and of basic intelligence..It was a tough sell to studios back in the 1960s, not only was the premise that formed Pierre Boulle's novel a tricky one, but the technical aspects, cost and quality of, also had the men in suits backing away from producer Arthur P. Jacobs and beefcake actor Charlton Heston. Eventually Dick Zanuck over at Fox nervously agreed to make it as long as significant tests ensured that farce would not follow. Stumping up $50,000 for John Chambers to develop the ape make up and masks, and a successful test run acted out by Edward G. Robinson as Dr Zaius opposite Heston, Planet of the Apes was given the green light. The script went through a number of changes as Serling and Wilson tossed around ideas to improve on Boulle's page turner, while Heston himself felt that the novel as written was unfilmable. Elsewhere, when director Schaffner came on board, he himself went for a more primitive ape world as opposed to the one under consideration that featured futuristic high rises and super advanced technology. What came out at the end of it all thankfully is one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time.What would follow the success of the film is well known, a number of inferior sequels, a TV series, a remake and even a prequel in 2011. Then of course there was the toys, models, comics, cartoons and T shirts - it at times felt in the 70s that there really was a Planet of the Apes, only this one was driven by commerce. The aftermath of the original film has not done it any favours, the lines have become blurred, with so much muck and tack about, it often gets forgotten just how clinically great Schaffner's movie is. If ever there was a film that deserves to be a standalone, this is the one. Follow Heston's brawny Taylor from the pitiful planting of the stars and stripes at the beginning, to that monumental ending, and then leave it at that, do not pass go, do not venture further into any sort of monkey business. No sequel necessary, for Planet of the Apes to truly hit you with maximum impact, it all needs to end right there on that shoreline. As the great Rod Serling intended in fact.Thematically the picture is acknowledged as being caustically strong, a sociological allegory, with pinches of racial animus just for flavouring. It might be under the guise of a sci-fi movie, but the makers aren't trying to hide it. Whilst the narrative twitches with comment, whoosh was that an aside to the Scopes trial? Film is also full of visceral thrills, pop-culture references and unnerving (alienation like) photographic beauty. The former comes with the hunt sequence, where we first meet gorilla's on horses, with guns and attitude, the latter with Shamroy's Panavision/De Luxe colour lensing of the California and Arizona locations. All enhanced by Goldsmith's aural pinging percussive led score. And while we continue to remember some of those famous bits of dialogue, we also pick up on each revisit to the film those little slices of humour slotted into the story - human see, human do indeed and the visual cheek of hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil...Film of course hinges on Heston's central human performance, of which he delivers athletic guts and subtle nuances in equal measure. Taylor's character arc demands repeat viewings to fully appreciate what Heston brings to the role. Take in the cynical Taylor who wanders through the Forbidden Zone in the first quarter, then marry it up to the Taylor fighting for his life in the middle, and finally to the Taylor at the denouement, it's a three pronged acting turn of some undervalued distinction. Not all muscular ""presence"" actors are/were able to be credible, Heston was. Around him in the monkey suits are true professionals, Hunter, McDowall, Evans (coming in for Robinson who feared for is health in the suit) and Whitmore, while Harrison in the non speaking human role of Nova does her job of looking gorgeous! All that's left to say is that Schaffner, who would win the Academy Award for Best Director two years later for Patton, pulls it all together neatly. 10/10",Planet of the Apes
25,Theo Robertson,Great Film,8,3 January 2003,"Unlike the recent Tim Burton remake this can be called a great film . Franklin J Schaffner does a good job of bringing an otherworldliness ( And just how ironic is that ?) to the film , and the ending is rightly regarded as a classic moment of cinema . This is how SF should be made ,  with little FX and with much intelligence .No doubt a reviewer can be critical and point out that a lot of the subtext of the original novel has been culled and there`s a serious lapse in logic in that both apes and humans speak the exact same language without either stopping to point this out , but I like this film and it`s too good to pick holes at",Planet of the Apes
26,Hey_Sweden,Provocative sci-fi classic.,10,20 February 2019,"Charlton Heston plays Taylor, one of a trio of surviving astronauts on an unknown planet in the far distant future. He and his companions eventually discover that they're not alone, but on this planet nature has undergone a sort-of reverse evolution: talking, horse-riding, gun-wielding apes are the dominant, civilized species, and humans are the non-speaking primitives. He is defended by two chimpanzee scientists, Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Zira (Kim Hunter), who seek to use him to explain their own theories. Opposing Taylor is the hateful, small-minded Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans), who knows FAR more than he's letting on.Over 50 years later, this well-produced and well-directed work still touches upon interesting ideas about the whole nature of mankind. Scripted by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling from the Pierre Boulle novel, it's intelligent, and dares to take its time with its story. It devotes a fair amount of its running time to the trial to which Taylor is subjected. Individuals like Dr. Zaius, prosecutor Honorious (James Daly), and the president (James Whitmore) firmly stand by their ideal that Taylor is no more than some sort of freak, even suggesting that Cornelius and Zira deliberately engineered him to be different from other humans.Excellent set design and widescreen photography are supplemented by an eclectic Jerry Goldsmith score, and a script with its fair share of philosophical moments.Heston is at his rugged best (and adds beefcake appeal for those interested) as the man who's determined that he be treated with more respect. The supporting cast is truly superb, many of them hidden behind impressive, Oscar-winning makeup by John Chambers. Lou Wagner, who plays Lucius, Ziras' opinionated nephew, has some of the most amusing lines. Evans is a wonderful antagonist. Linda Harrison is supremely sexy as the scantily clad ""Nova"", a human who catches Taylors' eye.This now legendary film ushered in an ongoing series that has included four theatrical sequels, a TV series, and an eventual ""reboot"" series of films in the 21st century. Along with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", it made 1968 a memorable year for the sci-fi genre.The justly famous ending is one worth waiting for, although this viewer will be careful to say no more on THAT subject.10 out of 10.",Planet of the Apes

Only three crew members survive, Taylor (Chartlon Heston), Landon (Robert Gunner) & Dodge (Jeff Burton) who find themselves in desert like conditions & struggling to survive the hostile planet. Just as all hope seems lost they encounter a tribe of humans who are then attacked by a group of man like talking Apes who have become the dominant race on the planet with man being the beast who are rounded up, put in zoos & experimented on. In the attack Landon & Dodge are lost while Taylor is shot in the the throat, unable to speak he is rounded up & put in a cage where kind Chimp female scientist named Zira (Kim Hunter) befriends Taylor & when he regains the ability to speak there are certain Ape hierarchy who want him dead so to preserve their own society & beliefs...Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner after J. Lee Thompson who was originally set to direct pulled out to make Mackenna's Gold (1969) this, I suppose, is considered as a true sci-fi classic & as I write this even makes it to number 228 in the IMDb's Top 250 & since this is a forty year old film that's pretty impressive going. The script from Twilight Zone host, creator & head writer Rod Serling & Michael Wilson was based on the novel Monkey Planet by Pierre Boulle although by all accounts refines it a little bit & adds that twist ending which surely everyone now knows, Planet of the Apes is a good solid sci-fi action adventure that uses the role reversal of a dominant Ape society living next to uncivilised wild human tribes to make some nice points about humanity, where we are going & has some strong social satire as well. From unfair trials to the religion versus science debate to prejudice to wanting to destroy what we don't understand to the ultimate devastation of war. Sure it's all good stuff, it's well written & it's very well put together & the fact most of the main character's are talking Apes it's deadly serious & it all works surprisingly well on various levels as a film that entertains & social satire that has meaning. Some of the sci-fi elements don't add up though, I don't believe the concept of time travel as described here & after a thousand odd years would that doll still be in perfect working order? Also I just don't believe Taylor wouldn't have guessed he was on Earth, I mean there are people there, Apes there, the technology is the same & the trees, sky water & terrain is exactly the same too so it wouldn't exactly take a genius to realise or even make an educated guess. Then there's that iconic twist ending, sure it's a great image but the fact everyone knows about it means it might not have the impact it once did & the fact most should realise that this is Earth means it shouldn't really come as much of a surprise. That's a minor quibble though in an otherwise very good sci-fi film that probably just about deserves it's classic status.The one outstanding area of Planet of the Apes is the Oscar winning make-up effects which are really very impressive even forty years later, the effects are very convincing & while not as good as the remake (no matter what anyone tells you) they hold up extremely well. There are some well staged action scenes too, in particular the sequence about thirty minutes in when the Apes attack & kill numerous humans while on horseback complete with memorable images of the Apes standing over the dead bodies of several humans posing for photographs. The opening as the three astronaut's walk through the harsh desert is also well shot & you can almost feel the heat & isolation. An extremely popular film at the time Planet of the Apes spawned four sequels, Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970), Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971), Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) & Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973) as well as the short lived TV series Planet of the Apes (1974) & the animated TV series Return to the Planet of the Apes (1975) before it was remade as a hundred million blockbuster by Tim Burton back in 2001.With a supposed budget of about $5,800,000 this wasn't mega budget but all money went on screen it seems, this is a great looking & designed film. The acting is good especially from those wearing Apes make-up.Planet of the Apes is considered a sci-fi classic & despite one or two minor flaws I would largely have to agree, it's maybe one of those iconic films that everyone should see at least once.",Planet of the Apes

I have always found that Charlton Heston's delivery tended a touch to theatrical monologue; but it really does work in this existential sci-fi story. Returning from a space voyage to Earth several thousand years after they left, the crew discover a planet (they are not even sure which one) ruled over by apes with their own sophisticated, hierarchical, though still agrarian, society. Heston is soon captured but luckily falls under the protection of two curiously-minded scientists ""Zira"" (Kim Hunter) and ""Cornelius"" (Roddy McDowell) who suspect that there is much more to their societal beginnings than are oft quoted in the sacred scriptures by ""Dr. Zaius"" (Maurice Evans).

Schnaffer's ""Planet of the Apes"" is an extraordinary science fiction film that synthesizes a fish-out-of-water adventure epic with an anti-nuclear war message in a dystopian setting. Charlton Heston stars simply as Taylor while the rest of the prestigious cast wears John Chambers' incredible make-up as chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. Moreover, despite having themselves concealed beneath layers of latex, Roddy McDowell, James Daley, James Whitmore, Kim Hunter, and Maurice Evans. ""A Place in the Sun"" scripter Michael Wilson rewrote Rod Serling's original screenplay with splendid results. When ""Planet of the Apes"" isn't being memorable science fiction, this Twentieth Century release skewers mankind for our pugnacity and willingness to destroy each other. The stunning long shot at fade-out takes on an added dimension in light of the 9/111 tragedy at the World Trade Towers. Meantime, Schnaffer and company strip Heston naked as he enters a world where simians rule and humans are the dregs of society. Wilson and Serling deliver considerable wit when they aren't demolishing us with message about world chaos. Remember, ""Planet of the Apes"" came out during the Cold War. Schnaffer orchestrates some incredible sequences, primarily the crash sequence in the lake. He shows everything from our heroes' perspective and gyrates his cameras vertiginous throughout so convey the out-of-control sensation. At no time are elaborate miniatures utilized until we see the spacecraft sinking in the lake. Basically, Heston finds himself held captive in a society that consists of apes. They treat mankind with utter contempt. He loses two of his companions after they fall in with the rest of the humans. Eventually, Heston attracts the interest of a curious couple of scientists and pleads his case before a tribunal before escaping to the Forbidden Land for refuge from the inhospitable apes.

32,Boba_Fett1138,A classic within- and outside of its genre.,9,21 October 2011,"""Planet of the Apes"" remains a great and special movie within its genre, that also still remains a perfectly watchable and effective one now days. After almost 50(!) years it hasn't lost any its power and might still very well make a big impact on you, when you go and see it for the fist time.The movie is still original to watch now days, so imaging how things must have been like for viewers back in 1968. It was something unseen, the way the movie approached its genre. Science-fiction at the time hadn't been a very profitable genre but more importantly, it was a genre that wasn't taken very seriously by critics and lots of film-makers. Yet this movie managed to get made, with lots of talents and acclaimed persons involved, in front and behind the cameras.This movie is all the more an accomplishment when you look at it from the perspective and context of its time period. Even though the movie is science-fiction and is definitely filled with lots of fiction, it still is one that puts its emphasis on its science. The movie takes a very reasonable approach to its story, events and characters. Everything gets looked at from different perspectives and asks itself a lot of questions, dealing with topics such as religion and what is it that makes a civilization an advanced and civilized one.But even when you don't read too deep into the movie and its themes, you'll still get plenty of enjoyment out of this movie. Even though it's most definitely not an action filled one, it's still fast paced and makes sure that there is always something happening or progressing within its story. I remember watching this movie ever since I was a young kid, when I probably couldn't even read subtitles yet but I never was bored with it, also not even now that I have seen the movie countless times already and know it by heart.It's a movie that is a quite serious one within its genre when you purely look at its story but luckily they managed to make the movie at the same time a very entertain and enjoyable one to watch. It's because the movie is filled with plenty of great and unforgettable moments and overall is an extremely well made one in every regard.One of the things obviously is its make-up. All of the apes are so fantastical but above all also realistic looking. They have a great look to them and it would had been very easy to mess up. Imaging how much this movie would had been laughed at and not taken seriously if it wasn't for the convincing and Oscar winning make-up effects, by John Chambers.Another thing that always stood out to me was the Jerry Goldsmith musical score. It's unlike anything else really and quite daring for its time as well. It suits the atmosphere and madness of the movie so well and over the years has grown out to be one of his most iconic and appreciated scores.What the movie always did so well to me was creating a sort of atmosphere of madness and absurdity. The main character finds himself in a pretty absurd situation from pretty much the start on already and things soon start to get worse and worse and more unusual for him. Just like the main character, you really want to scream out, when he gets treated incredibly unrighteously and hold prison by the apes. All of these elements get strengthened due to the entire way the movie got shot and told by Franklin J. Schaffner, along with its sets, experimental style of film-making, make-up, music and acting performance by Charlton Heston.Yes, of course I can see how incredibly over-the-top Charlton Heston is going with his performance at times but I actually think this adds to the movie its madness and unusual style and story. I wouldn't want to have it any other way really. Also amazing to see lots of other great actors from the earlier days of cinema behind the ape make-up. Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall were pretty big acting names once and this so easily could had been a movie that would had done more harm than good for their careers but needless to say that it all turned out alright. Not that they had big shining careers after this movie but it at least added some wonderful and memorable roles to their resume and legacy as actors.And talking about memorable; it's definitely true that this movie has one of the absolute best surprise endings and shots out of movie history. I'm not going to spoil it for you, some DVD covers are doing that already. But man, I would love to see some of the surprises off people's faces who see it for the first time. It's however hard to imaging though that there are actually still people out there who haven't seen this movie yet.A classic, not just only within its genre and an absolute must-see for everybody.9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Planet of the Apes
33,view_and_review,Get your stinkin paws off me you damn dirty apes!,9,7 February 2007,"I was afforded the displeasure of seeing the 2001 version of Planet of the Apes before seeing the original. There were quite a few variances, and I must say that the original was far better. While watching Planet of the Apes I began to realize that the movie was much more than a movie about Apes taking over the planet, it was a movie trying to tackle two very big social issues: 1.) racism & 2.) science v. religion.From the first scene when the humans were being rounded up by the apes, it was wrought with the very manner in which African slaves were treated just a few hundred years ago. They were being netted and shot, then they were caged and constantly being berated and told that they were not even evolved. There were a few lines that came direct from the oppressor handbook, and the hosing scenes were direct from the civil rights protests.Intertwined in the story was that of science versus religion. On the one hand there was the young ape Cornelius who had done some excavation and found artifacts suggesting that an intelligent man existed even before apes and there was a possibility that apes evolved. Opposing him was Dr. Zaius and his counsel who were fervently upholding the sacred texts they had stating that man was always an animal devoid of any real intellect.It was really interesting how this movie played out, and how it was done. The court scene portrayed best the two elements the movie reflected (racism and science v. religion). In the court scene Taylor (Charlton Heston), was not allowed to represent himself or even speak although he exhibited the intelligence to do so, in fact his fate was already decided. And at the same time the arguments of science having findings that contradicted the popular religious thought were not even listened to either, and it was decided that the two young scientists (Cornelius and Zira) had committed heresy. This movie was very deep and thought provoking. It was no mere science fiction, it was more of a drama in the guise of a science fiction to be more palatable and not such a ringing wake up call.",Planet of the Apes
34,neil-476,Significant and entertaining,9,1 March 2011,"I was a keen reader of science fiction in my teens in the 60s, and one book I particularly enjoyed was a novel called Monkey Planet (mistranslated from Planet des Singes) by a French novelist called Pierre Boulle (in my ignorance I didn't realise that he had also written Bridge On The River Kwai). I was mightily pleased when this novel - which ends up with two pretty good twists - was adapted for the cinema.The film makers took a lot of liberties with the novel (including dropping the two closing twists in the novel and adding one of their own) but they succeeded in making it that rarity - a film with something to say which was also eye-catching, action-packed, and thoroughly entertaining.The message about racial intolerance only mildly bludgeons the audience, and this doesn't really matter, so caught up are we in adventure and satire. Heston's gravitas sweeps away any sense of triviality which might otherwise work against the movie, and McDowell, Hunter and Evans all perform well behind the practical difficulties of the ape makeup. Only Linda Harrison, in the thankless role of Nova, is less than brilliant, but at least she is decorative.Hindsight shows that the ape makeup is, perhaps, not entirely deserving of the Oscar it won (the ape makeup in Kubrick's 2001 in the same year was far superior) but, apart from that, this movie succeeds on every level and keeps you glued to the screen from Taylor's opening log entry as the spaceship approaches the planet, to the final, brilliantly executed twist. The shock of this on first seeing it cannot be overestimated and even now, after multiple viewings, it is still riveting.",Planet of the Apes
35,evanston_dad,Monkey Business,8,1 February 2007,"Charlton Heston dons a loincloth and impersonates a human in this cheezy cult classic about a future world where apes walk upright and speak in clipped British accents.What a fun movie this is, thanks mostly to Heston's inability to deliver a line in a manner that even remotely resembles the way an actual human being would deliver it (""You bloody baboon!!"") The film makes a nice companion piece with another 1968 release in which apes figure heavily, ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" though neither film will leave you feeling especially rosy about the eventual fate of man (we're apparently going to be either personal valets to gorillas or abstract fetuses floating through space).A host of classy actors appears in this, but you won't recognize any of them, thanks to the truly impressive makeup effects of John Chambers. And take note, M. Night Shyamalan -- THIS is the way to use a surprise ending.Grade: A",Planet of the Apes

Schaffner / Cast: Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans, James Whitmore: Here is a total switch on the rules with regards to dominance. Four astronauts are in hyper sleep and land in water on a bare rocky planet. A female astronaut died and the other two are killed at the hands of a band of apes on horseback who capture humans for sport and research. After a throat injury Charlton Heston is caged with a woman. He cannot speak but after an escape attempt he yells out, ""Get your paws off me, you damn dirty ape!"" Heston makes failed attempts to convey his story of humans but the apes won't have it until he takes matters into his own hands. Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter play an engaged chimp couple doing research on humans. They are sympathetic to Heston's cause when they realize that he is superior intelligence. Maurice Evans plays an orangutan who heads the courts and denies Heston on every single claim until Heston decides to force his proof. James Whitmore plays the president of the assembly. We have chimpanzees in the labs. We have orangutans heading the courts. We have gorillas hunting humans. Gibbons seem to be left out in the ape department here. The ending is a big downer, and watching Heston kiss a female ape is retching but its role reversal is intriguing. Score: 8 / 10",Planet of the Apes

38,Wuchakk,"""Don't look for it, Taylor, you might not like what you find""",9,19 August 2011,"THE PLOT: George Taylor and two other astronauts experience some type of time warp in space and crashland on a distant planet over 2000 years in the future. They soon discover that highly evolved apes rule the planet while humans are disdained ""animals."" WHAT WORKS: First of all, Charlton Heston is outstanding as the disillusioned humanity-hating Taylor. Taylor is brilliantly put in the ironic position of representing humankind to the apes. Although I love Heston in other films like ""Ben-Hur"" and ""The Ten Commandments,"" I believe Taylor is his best role and performance. Heston was, incidentally, 43 years old at the time of filming. He's utterly captivating in the role and charismatic in an anti-hero sense.The first 35 minutes of the film involve the crashland, the search over the wastelands, the discovery of primitives and, finally, the potent cornfield revelation. This segment is one of my favorite parts of the film. The desert wastelands are awe-inspiring and one can't help but enjoy Taylor's amusingly pessimistic antics. This part of the film is highly mysterious in nature. Where ARE they? Why are there so few signs of life? Did Taylor hate humanity so much that he was literally willing to escape his home world? Who made the strange X-shaped scarecrows? Why can't the primitive ""cavemen"" speak? Who planted the crops of corn?When the story shifts to the ape city the film takes on an entirely different vibe. There's suddenly no more mystery and the shift is so jarring that the film momentarily loses its captivating sense of awe. No matter, the viewer is soon engulfed in the social dynamics of the ape society.The rough-hewn, alien-looking rock city sets are marvelous and the ape make-up is exceptional considering the time period. In fact, it holds up pretty well even to this day.It is soon discovered that the apes have three distinct ""races"": The chimps are scientific, humanitarian and pacifistic; the gorillas are militaristic; and the orangutans are the respected elders & religious leaders. The attention to detail of the ape society, and the social dynamics thereof, is nothing less than brilliant. The apes have their own distinctive walk and the actors do a splendid job depicting facial expressions through all that make-up, giving life to their characters.The story's characters are distinctly fleshed-out and superbly performed by all involved: Nova, the animal-like primal beauty (Linda Harrison). Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowall), who are willing to risk everything for the sake of the truth and their ideals. Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evens), the defender of the apes' religious faith and protector of their society. Heck, even the secondary characters are great, like the chimp teenager Lucius and the gorilla jailguard Julius.Although Dr. Zaius is portrayed as an antagonist, it's impossible to hate him. One ascertains that he only acts in the best interest of the apes. He's very learned and, although he doesn't know or believe everything about Taylor and humankind in general, he does know that humans were once the dominant species of the planet, ages ago, but they foolishly destroyed themselves and their great society. He knows very well that the apes have this same destructive potential so he does everything in his power to protect the community he knows and loves. Note how Cornelius and Zira regard Zaius with the reverence and respect at all times, even when they are fugitives and Taylor has Zaius captive. This shows their humility and respectfulness. Also notice that, at the very end, right before Taylor and Nova depart down the shoreline on the horse, Zaius suddenly has it in his power to stop and even kill Taylor, but he DOESN'T. He lets them go. Why? I believe this reveals his good character and shows that he's not a villain at all. He knew Taylor could have easily killed him numerous times when he had the upper hand, so he mercifully returns the favor -- to an ""animal"" no less! Also, consider this: Although Zaius is shown in a negative light by hindering scientific efforts to discover historical truth, the Lawgiver's scriptures that he quotes from are RIGHT -- humans ARE destructive & made a desert of parts of the planet and, for the sake of ape society, should not be allowed to ""breed in great numbers."" Zaius obviously feels that the apes, in general, can't handle the truth. The climax is incredible (SPOILER ALERT!): Taylor and Nova travel a LONG distance down the shoreline while the viewer hears eerie music on the soundtrack. Something's just not right; it's too quiet and uneventful. There's no way it's gonna end like this. And then, suddenly, the truth about the ""planet of the apes"" is revealed. Utterly dumbfounded, Taylor jumps off his horse and furiously pounds his fists into the surf while screaming curses at humanity.Also, the score by Jerry Goldsmith is PERFECT -- fittingly eerie and primal.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Sometimes the apes' mouths don't move enough when they speak and it clearly looks artificial. Also, there are a few corny elements of dialogue and the social commentary is occasionally tacky.The only real plothole is that the apes speak English (!), which means this couldn't be another planet, unless it's perhaps another dimension with certain parallels. FINAL ANALYSIS: This is a great science-fiction film, even though it's well over forty years old. Every time I see it I re-discovered certain things and ""see"" others for the first time! I should also point out that ""Planet of the Apes"" is very adult-oriented (even though kids will, of course, appreciate many aspects of it). Although there is quite a bit of action, it is by no means an action flick. It's primarily a dialogue-driven sci-fi adventure. Lastly, this film and its sequel ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" (which is technically the only sequel) should be viewed as ONE long film/story.",Planet of the Apes
39,zetes,A milestone; one of the best films ever made,10,28 July 2001,"When I recently, for fun, ranked my favorite films in a top 100 list, Planet of the Apes ended up at 33. It was the second sci-fi on the list, after 2001, which ranked #1. I have always been disappointed and irked at the ill-will that some people have towards Planet of the Apes. I almost assaulted someone who described Apes as ""one of those so-bad-it's-funny type of movies"" a few months ago. I take this film very seriously, and I wish others would do the same.I think one of the reasons there is so much animosity against this one is that it is undeniably dated. Not too much, but it would be difficult to sit a young teenager, raised on 1990s movies, down in front of it and have him/her enjoy it. Even a young adult, between the ages of 18 and 25, would find it difficult. Planet of the Apes definitely exists in a specific time, the late 1960s. This was the best decade for film, churning out tons of both American and foreign masterpieces. Times were rough, and the Vietnam War was growing in intensity by the time Planet of the Apes was made. Because of this, we see many references to the current dilemma. The film willy-nilly debates issues like hunting, violence, animal rights, evolution vs creationism, class structure, and nuclear war. Taylor tells a young, rebellious, teenage chimpanzee not to trust anyone over 30 (a common youth adage in the late 60s). Yes, it has so many topics that it seems to be about to burst at times. And, yes, the satire does go overboard once in a while. Still, it is all argued passionately. You can tell that everyone involved, even Heston, believes in what they are saying. In its own way, Planet of the Apes is as intellectual and philosophical a film as 2001. I know that, when teens and younger people go see the Tim Burton remake (which is not great, btw), there are going to be many who overpraise it and say that it is much better than the original. You would have to be mentally handicapped to honestly believe so.",Planet of the Apes

And what makes this movie such an enduring flick, apart from the larger than life alpha-male screen presence of Charlton Heston, is that it's about what science fiction does best: examine real-life issues (race, class) by flinging them into the far reaches of time and outer space. It's everything that was great about THE TWILIGHT ZONE writ large, and will continue to resonate for some time. There's also spectacular makeup effects, the searing cavewoman hotness of Linda Harrison (mmm, Nova), and some gorgeous widescreen canyon vistas.

Charlton plays an American astronaut who travels to the future with his colleges, and they crash on an ""unknown"" planet where apes are in charge and treat humans like zoo creatures.The plot gets more amusing as Charlton is the only human that can speak and communicate as the apes do. Only three apes are on his side and believe his incredible journey and some hot mute chick. :) Which by the way, her legs are shaved, her body is in great shape, and her teeth are perfectly white. I love these plot holes. But Planet of the Apes is a classic that should not be missed!

While Charlton Heston is the center character in this, it is a great script & great support by folks like Maurice Evans, Kim Hunter, Roddy Mcdowell that carry the acting in this film over the top. Heston is OK, but has been better in other films.The script does carry this film. Tim Burton found this out to his chagrin when he tried & failed to improve upon it. The story actually illustrates in a sense how absurd evolution theory can be viewed but at the same time makes it look extremely viable. Tim Burton's handicap is that he did not have a Rod Sterling to write for his version. A world where apes evolve from man, there has got to be an answer. It boggles the mind and the senses. While this film is not for the serious Scientist, the Science Fiction genre of film has never been done better than this outing. It holds viewers spellbound with wonder & imagination upon the first viewing & kept us that way long enough to produce a raft of sequels.",Planet of the Apes
44,Red-Barracuda,A justifiably iconic sci-fi adventure,7,18 June 2013,"1968 seems to have been something of a watershed year for cinematic science fiction. It was the year that both 2001: A Space Odyssey and Planet of the Apes were released. Both films were game changers in that they were big budget sci-fi made by the major studios. Up until that time, the genre had been very much mostly the province of the B movie. After the massive success of those two a series of often extremely interesting science fiction films were released by the studios. In effect these movies created a situation where the genre could flourish, with bigger budgets and more seriousness. Of course those films were quite different; while both dealt with some serious themes, 2001 is by far the more intellectual and is pure hard sci-fi – Planet of the Apes, on the other hand, lay somewhere between 2001 and traditional action-adventure fare.It does deal have definite social commentary and like many sci-fi films, it's about the time it was made as much as it is a look into the future. It considers the dangers of nuclear war and comments on the racial tensions of 60's America – both through allegory in its post-apocalyptic world. I guess this is one of the things that makes it work so well, the upside down society of the Planet of the Apes allows for an underlying message while at the same time offering up a thrilling sci-fi adventure scenario. To be perfectly honest, it works great as the latter. For me, the best parts are the early scenes leading up to the capture of the astronauts. The mystery of the strange world and the unforgettable arrival of the horse-riding apes in the fields are terrific. While John Chambers has been rightly praised for the ape make-up, a lot of credit should also go to Leon Shamroy for his stunning cinematography which is particularly brilliant in these early scenes, with great shots from unusual high angles that makes the planet seem so very ominous. Kudos too, to Jerry Goldsmith for his soundtrack whose strange tones compliment the visuals. When we reach the ape town, it's the fantastic set-design that takes centre stage with those houses that seem to come out of the rocks organically. Charlton Heston leads the picture of course and he does provide star charisma but it's the character actors in the heavy make-up that make the best impression, namely Roddy McDowell, Kim Hunter and Maurice Evans. And of course, wellthere's that ending.",Planet of the Apes
45,sddavis63,Still The Classic Movie Version,9,10 August 2002,"I enjoyed the ""Apes"" remake that came out a couple of years ago, but I have to say that the original version of this movie is still by far the better. It's a marvelous mix of well done science fiction, gripping drama and a healthy dose of parody that makes the whole thing a truly engrossing picture to watch. I wouldn't even want to guess how many times I've seen this, and I still am not tired of it.It's not really a film version of the book of the same name by Pierre Boulle. The story is quite different, although the basic elements of the book are found here. The story - if anyone really needs to know - is quite simple. Astronauts from the early 1970's travel through time and land on a mysterious planet that they discover is ruled by apes, and where mute humans are regarded as no better than nuisances and are hunted as animals and used for medical experiments.Charlton Heston plays the astronaut ""Taylor,"" commander of the mission. His character is interesting and also quite tragic. Taylor is a cynic, who leaves earth believing that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. Finally he comes across this world where humans seem to live relatively idyllic and peaceful lives, only to discover that the apes of this world are just as bad as the humans he left behind. All the problems of human society are reflected in this ape society. There's bigotry (orangutans look down their noses at chimpanzees, and gorillas seem to be relegated to the status of soldiers), there's conflict between religion and science with a hearing that vaguely resembles an inquisition, and there's fear of anything new and unknown (ie, Taylor.)Heston was the only one of the human characters who was essential to the story, and his performance was excellent. Otherwise the biggest marks were left by those playing the apes. Roddy McDowell was a fine actor, but will he really be remembered for anything other than ""Apes"" in its various incarnations? Kim Hunter as Zira was wonderful and Maurice Evans put on a fine performance as Dr. Zaius (Minister of Science and Chief Defender of the Faith, in a wonderful combination of contradictory offices which Taylor points out.)I'll remember this movie always for some wonderful lines:""Human see, human do"" (Julius to Zira as Taylor tries unsuccessfully to talk after his throat injury)""Get your stinking paws off me, you damn, dirty ape!"" (Taylor's first words to the apes after his capture)""Somehow, it makes you look less intelligent."" (Cornelius to Taylor after the latter shaves his beard off)""God damn you all to hell!"" (Taylor at the end of the movie, as he discovers the dark secret of this strange planet)It's not without flaws. The timeline bothers me. (SPOILER HERE)Only a little over 2,000 years has passed since Taylor left earth, yet in 2,000 years apes have evolved to the point at which they can speak? I thought the evolutionary process was a bit slower than that. And it's ironic (and convenient) that the language they developed was perfect English. (I know that this could be explained by the events of ""Escape"" and ""Conquest"" - numbers 3 & 4 in the series - but surely human history in those movies is different than Taylor's history simply because of the arrival of the apes, and therefore we still have the problem of all the apes in installment 1 speaking perfect English.)Oh well, nothing is perfect, but this is close. If you liked the remake, you must watch the original. It's a bit dated, but still holds up.9/10",Planet of the Apes

A mad house.""",10,11 December 2005,"I have always found it easier to write about the junky, cheesy movies I watch than it is to write about why a certain movie works flawlessly with me. I find that I enjoy my favorite movies for personal reasons that are difficult to put into words. For me, Planet of the Apes is one of those flawless movies. Everything works perfectly - the plot, the acting, the special effects, the locations, and the action. Charlton Heston is an actor who could chew the scenery with the best of Hollywood. But in Planet of the Apes, it works for me because for long stretches of the movie, he's the only human with a line of dialogue. The movie might have become dull with an actor with less of a screen presence. The ape makeup is fantastic. Like a lot of fans of the movie, I went to see Tim Burton's re-imaging. And while the apes may have looked more ape-like, I'll take Roddy McDowell in a latex mask any day. The music is otherworldly brilliant and fits every scene. Oh, I could go on and on for pages, but I'll stop here. As I said, it's difficult for me to explain why I enjoy Planet of the Apes so much, I just know that I wouldn't change a thing.There are certain images and moments in Planet of the Apes that will always stick with me. I look forward to revisiting them each time I get the chance to re-watch the movie. The final scene is iconic and needs no further explanation. Other favorite bits from the movie include: the ""hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil"" courtroom scene, Heston trapped in the net, and Heston's goodbye kiss with Zira. But one of my favorite moments is the first images of the gorillas on horseback. Heston and a few other humans are in the cornfields, crouching low. A horse and rider gallop past and make a quick turn. The rider's face comes into frame and we see not a man, but an ape. It's an amazing moment in cinema!",Planet of the Apes
47,ElMaruecan82,When the worse that could happen was still the lesser of two evils...,9,30 April 2018,"""Planet of the Apes"" was adapted from a novel by Pierre Boulle, a name I didn't forget ever since I was left speechless by the ending of ""The Bridge Over the River Kwai"". Speaking of that ending, one can't easily forget the sight of Major Clifton standing alone on the titular river and contemplating the sacrifice of hundreds of lives at the altar of human 'madness'. Madness was the repeated word indeed, almost an arc quote, a motto insisting on men's inclination to destruction and self-destruction. This was perhaps a close-to-perfect ending if it wasn't for the upbeat military fanfare that started playing during the credits, this was an epitaph-like conclusion that didn't call for any music, only silence, or the sound of palm tree leaves shaken by the breeze while we'd play that word in our minds.And as if Franklin J. Shaffner had thought over it, his ending of ""Planet of the Apes"" also mirrored human's destructive predispositions and madness (the word used is 'maniacs') and Charlton Heston hysterical (and not histrionic) reaction is even more powerful than Clifton in 'Kwai' because the destroyed landmark is more iconic and rooted in our universal imagery and maybe because no one saw it coming... and maybe the ending is more powerful on a pure cinematic level, because this time, there was no score, no music. And considering how iconic Jerry Goldsmith's theme was and quite revolutionary for its time, that it wasn't used for the film's climactic moment is a credit to an inspired directing, aware that audiences in the theater would gasp at the final sight and only the sounds of the waves on the beach would be enough. I'm not spoiling the film but I'm not kidding myself either, I know that 99% of those who'll read this know what I'm talking about, I just find it better left unspoken, keeping a wave of mystery about it. But we all know it's the most memorable part of the film and it became a trope codifier, so while they might be a few flaws to spot here and there, they're nothing when everything is only a build up to that moment and how it closes the arc started with Colonel Taylor's opening statement about human nature. At the end, you can't help but feel that you've just watched a very smart and intelligent movie about the decay of humanity and how quickly and easily all the pillars of civilizations we've taken for granted can vanish. Einstein said """"I do not know with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones"". With that in mind, it's impossible not to see in the abundance of primitiveness featured in the film and the lack of robotic device the most realistic futuristic vision of our world, or the most plausible, with the apes having reached human-like intelligence and speech patterns. And it's fascinating how the film and its counterpart of the same year ""2001"" converge toward the same idea that humanity might survive but maybe in another place... but the film has also in common with another series featuring apes (who are also present in ""2001"").The ""Planet of the Apes"" series is perhaps the most iconic ape-related series after ""King Kong"" and came from Boulle's regret not to have conceived the iconic monster but I guess it says a lot about the way human treated animals and most especially its distant cousin 'monkey' with both disdain and compassion, not being humbled the slightest by the teachings of Darwin. But while in King Kong, the ape was powerful enough to take his revenge against men before 'Beauty' would kill the 'Beast', in ""Planet of the Apes"", it's a matter of intelligence, not heart and apes match human qualities and conquer their world using their methods, being as smart and yes, as destructive as human beings.And it's quite humbling to have these cocky, confident and sexy-looking astronauts being reduced to stuffed museum corpses, lobotomized zombies or a domestic animals. Incapable to talk or produce a proper sound, Taylor is forced to act like the animal they think they are desperately trying to win the sympathy of Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Zira (Kim Hunter), it's funny but in a way that make us root for humans when the roles are reversed, from an animal perspective, while the monkeys represent the ""human"" side with a theocratic state and a caste society of their own: gorillas as soldiers, chimp as science people and Orangutans as rulers, on the top of them Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans).Zaius is played like a scientist who holds human in the same contempt than Taylor in his first scene, so we can't totally despise him although the narrative needs him as an antagonist to drive Taylor's actions and reveal the good heart of his chimp friends, yet he's villain who has a point to make. On the other hand, Taylor must look like a hero representing our civilization yes he's much aware of his animal status in the ""island"" and can't ignore Nova, the beautiful primitive girl he needed to repopulate the place, notice that he didn't ask her for her permission. So, the film features creatures who're reduced to their bestiality and or/civilizations in a rather fascinating conflict, there's no much sophistication or costly sci-fi extravaganza, but it serves the film, which is never as great and captivating as when it intelligently confronts us to our own conditions... like in ""2001"".The film opened a series of sequels but on its own, this is a great classic, a staple of modern cinema, parodied countless and countless times, from ""The Simpsons"" to Mel Brooks; and one can't just forget its extraordinary ending and the statement it makes about humanity, What can happen and what might happen and by being as destructive as animals, we might destroy our own civilization, when being humans doesn't make you immune to human behavior or when what looked the worse all throughout the picture is revealed to be the lesser of two evils.",Planet of the Apes

If you haven't (and you have an appreciation for classic sci-fi in general) then you should definitely watch it. It's more than just some flimsy pulp sci-fi starring men in rubber masks.First of all, the masks are actually pretty convincing and the apes take on personalities of their own. But, it's Charlton Heston's film really. He plays the last of three astronauts who crash lands on a planet where humans are feral mutes and apes are the dominant species.He plays the cynical leader of the mission who was trying to get away from humanity. Well, he certainly got his wish. Now, he finds himself a prisoner of the apes who want to cut him open and find out why he keeps nattering on! There's action (hardly on a par with anything of today's standards), but it's still good, plus great characters and sci-fi of a quality that will stay with you forever. I'm not saying anything that will spoil it (assuming you haven't seen it already). Just don't look at one of the cover designs - I really can't believe that they allowed that to be the first image you see of the film!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Planet of the Apes
49,ThomasDrufke,Monumental Achievement For Science Fiction,8,26 June 2014,"The Apes movies had always seemed like a joke to me, until I watched Rise of the Planet of the Apes a few years back. It was a movie that made me love an Ape more than the humans and it was one of the best showcases of motion capture I had ever seen. So before the new Dawn of the Planet of the Apes comes out, I thought I would check out the original classic. I have to say it doesn't disappoint, and as a matter of fact, I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. It is much different from the reboot, but did offer up some questions about where humanity was and where it may be headed. Obviously to think that Apes will somehow take over as the dominant race would be preposterous but the film makes it believable. Besides the fact that the back cover of the movie somewhat spoils the ending, I think the movie is just genius.The reboot is much more relatable because of the time period and the place that it happens in, but there is something about apocalyptic movies that have mystery behind them that I find so fascinating. I think that the movie also does a much better job at building up the reveal of apes than the new Godzilla movie did. I knew what the apes looked like, but the fact that Heston and his crew were on the planet for a good 20 minutes before they find anybody, and the tense and haunting soundtrack does nothing but help the build up to the reveal.I do think that at times the apes can be goofy and the weak dialogue between humans and apes can be laughable but again the soundtrack and mystery behind it has me crawling back in. The apes are not at all menacing and really the only one that I felt connected to was Zira. Time has definitely helped these apes movies and the franchise is moving towards something special. I hope the new film has a great story and at some point using some of the old story arcs for future films?+Compelling story +Haunting score +That ending....-...Too bad the DVD cover spoils it -At times Goofy dialogue 8.6/10",Planet of the Apes
50,Cineanalyst,Twilight Zone,7,4 April 2020,"It's not surprising that Rod Sterling, creator of ""The Twilight Zone"" TV series, is credited as one of the screenwriters of ""Planet of the Apes,"" as the film plays out like an extended, in length and cinematic visuals, episode of that serial--twist ending included. No wonder, either, that this film spawned its own cinematic series, as well as a TV series and a franchise reboot. While amusingly imaginative in some respects, including time travel in space and apes as the dominant species, the film is inevitably earthbound.That shouldn't have been surprising, either. Granted, talking apes are strange, but that they're speaking English, and the fact that there are humans running about, should've given it away. I mean, why is the Statue of Liberty definitive proof for someone who is already willing to suspend disbelief over a shared language and shared species? Additionally, I'll buy the time traveling through some cosmic Kaleidoscope, as well as the talking people in ape makeup, but I can't believe that a language would survive over two millennia without change--especially when all other traces of intelligent human existence are reduced to poorly understood or explored ruins. At least give them ""Star Trek"" universal translators or something.That aside, the Statue of Liberty matte work is iconic, as are some of Charlton Heston's lines in other scenes, including, of course, ""Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!"" The attempts here to quiet Heston's astronaut, Taylor, including in a sham trial orchestrated by backwards zealots, reads as subtext for the blacklisting by the House of Un-American Activities when considering that Sterling's script was rewritten by formerly-blacklisted writer Michael Wilson. In the end, Taylor is ostracized, venturing off into the wilderness with a misogynist's ideal woman, a mute simpleton named ""Nova."" Indeed, others have tried to read racial themes into the film, but I find the treatment of gender more striking in these first entries in the series. After all, the space mission, as Taylor describes it, included the female Stuart to be the new ""Eve"" on another planet (to three men, no less!), but her character dies without ever having muttered a word. The only woman who does speak in the film is a chimpanzee, Zira, and her exercising of her voice leads to all sorts of upheaval, including aiding the escape of that rebellious Homo sapien. It's a novel world for being ruled by apes, but remains all too familiar for being one also ruled by patriarchy. Good musical score by Jerry Goldsmith, too.",Planet of the Apes
51,lesleyharris30,"Very Interesting and Mentally Terrifying,",9,9 September 2012,"Planet of the Apes is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline with an outstanding cast.The movie is beautifully directed and still holds up even after all these years,the apes make up is incredible and very realistic.I find the movie quite terrifying,I don't know why but it feels so real to me,I feel like this could really happen some day,probably because apes are very intelligent and the closest species to human.The twist at the end is outstanding,I knew what was going to happen (because of constant parodies of the final scene) and I was still swept away by how intense the scene was,certainly frightening and Charlton Heston's dramatic acting is outstanding.Planet of the Apes is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great adventure or science fiction.

52,secondtake,"Perfect for what it is, which is this giant, profound metaphor and bad acting.",9,19 April 2010,"Planet of the Apes (1968)This is like 2001: A Space Odyssey backwards. Same year, same premise, different results.And no matter how much you like the slicker effects of the remake, there is something just right here about the characters and plot and even the special effects, crude as they are. It's not a convincing movie, but it's a great one, a children's story in its elegance, and an eternal myth in its infancy, somehow.Yes, it's crude. I don't mean just the suits and space ship and architecture (which is meant to be crude, by the way). But the moralizing, the parallel philosophy and science of these apes to our own, with things wonderfully backwards enough to throw doubt on our doubts.Charlton Heston? A convincing cardboard hero. Flat as cardboard, but beefy and determined and stoic in that American way he is actually pretty famous for. He gets to shoot a few higher beings, he gets to have woman who doesn't talk back, and he doesn't burn in the sun. Not bad! And really, that's just what we want, a live version of a comic book hero in a make believe land.Except it isn't make believe at all. The last scene I have etched in my ten year old brain (I'm not ten now, but admit I was in 1968) and it gave me goosebumps again. Mind blowing then, amazingly simple and clever now.

54,Bored_Dragon,Excellent satire of human civilization,9,23 March 2017,"From today's point of view this movie could seem a bit naive, but for 60's it is a masterpiece. If we take exception to outdated technology, I can not find any flaws in this movie. Camera and directing are great, the movie is a feast for the eyes. And satire of human civilization is excellent. Film tackles burning issues of 60's and 70's, that are still relevant today - hunt for sports, treatment of animals and nature overall, the conflict between science and religion, precisely between evolutionism and creationism, and most of all fear of nuclear war that was at its peak those days. Although I knew vaguely what this movie was about and I guessed how it ends at the very beginning, it did not spoil excitement a bit. I was not surprised by anything in this movie, but I was thrilled by everything. True masterpiece.9/10",Planet of the Apes
55,atlasmb,Iconic Film Is Flawed,6,30 December 2014,"I must disagree with those who acclaim this film as one of the greatest ever. The story is interesting and contains a final twist that would be dramatic if only it were not undermined by geography. Productions values are, in many ways, amateurish. This was probably due to budget constraints, but they show.And let's talk about the script. The dialogue is so unbelievable that the actors cannot voice it convincingly. The faux fights convey no passion or realistic conflict. Bottom line: Charlton Heston's character (Taylor) is not believable. And most of the others are likewise shallow. On the other hand, the film makes an important statement about separation of church and state.The makeup is the best part of the film and it deserves to be recognized.There are two aspects of the film that really drag it down for me. In one scene, Taylor runs through a natural history museum where there are small dioramas of human life. There are people posing as mannequins and it is so obvious, it is ridiculous. It is cheaper to pose people than mannequins, I suppose. The second aspect is the silly ""speak no evil"" tableau during the trial, for which I am downgrading my vote by one. In film, restraint is the better part of artistry.",Planet of the Apes
56,ironhorse_iv,Shouldn't this movie be call Planet of the Simians?,8,25 March 2013,"Don't get me wrong, I like the epic title of Planet of the Apes, but wasn't Planet of the Apes based on the novel by Pierre Boule whom most famous for his work on ""Bridge on the River Kwai"". Wasn't that novel at first call, La Planète des singes, known in English as Planet of the Apes or Monkey Planet? The French word Singes refers to both monkeys and apes. But there is no other word in the French language that I could find that refers to monkeys or apes. So I think that it literally means Simians. Franklin J. Schaffner has directed some of the most magnificent looking movies ever known for such works as Patton. I was excited to see the Blu-ray treatment given to arguably his most famous film Planet of the Apes. Sadly, this one misses the planet, but the movie was still a treat. The movie starts out with the story of an astronaut crew who crash land on a strange planet in the distant future. Although the planet appears desolate at first, the surviving crew members stumble upon a society in which apes have evolved into creatures with human like intelligence and speech. The apes have assumed the role of the dominant species and humans are mute creatures wearing animal skins. Nova (Linda Harrison) was hot and sexy. Considering the Apes supposed intelligence, it's enigmatic how their cities are built of stone and their only available means of transportation are primitive horse-and-buggies so unlike the novel. This film really needs to be made the way it was intended in the novel, with the astronauts landing on a parallel world, where the apes are technologically advanced. To save money on productions, the writers found a clever way to make the apes seems less advanced. This film is a blatant piece of evolutionary propaganda made to push the unproven and unprovable theory of evolution. It's hard to believe that, the apes evolve to human level in just 2000 years? In the movie, the apes have taken over and on an evolutionary timescale are just behind 20th century homo-sapiens. Their society has some differences of course, due to cost of religious leaders lead by Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) of this ape-society are portrayed as medieval like suppressors or scientific truth, with the young and humble seekers of truth like Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) and Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) only asking for honest answers. This perpetuates the commonly held myth that in our history, the Church of the Medieval West was opposed to truth and would have kept people in the darkness of superstition if it had not been for the heroes of the renaissance and the enlightenment, such as Galileo. The trial of George Taylor (Charlton Heston) mimics the very real trial of Dredd Scott's case for freedom. The movie speaks about the unjust treatment of the oppressed groups of people due to ethics reasoning. The movie might be a Sci-Fiction, but there are scenes in the movie that mirrors real life events such as Taylor getting hose down. Bull Conner turn the hose in the South at Civil Rights demonstrators in the 1960's. I love the Cold War aspects of this movie. They're just as fun to analyzes as the race aspects. Taylor left Earth because of his huge dislike of humanity's faults like war, but in the care of the apes, he find his humanity for his fellow man only to have it dashed away by what he sees in the ending. The screenplay was written by Rod Sterling of Twilight-Zone fame, who managed to inject enough of his show's trademark philosophical inventiveness and ""what-if"" creepiness into Planet. The twist ending is clearly written by him. Actually the ending of Tim Burton's remake stuck pretty true to Boulles version of Planet of the Apes. I like Sterling ending more. Too bad, I noticed that the cover of most of the DVD and VHS versions gives away the ending of the movie. Now this doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever. I guess some marketing genius at 20th Century Fox believes that everyone has already seen this movie and knows the ending, without thinking that there might be a whole generation of kids who have never seen the film. Thanks for spoiling it, Fox before I even put the disk in. The ending of this film sends a chill down my spine every time I see it. I have also notice that the film have similarities to other novels like H. G Wells 'Time Machine' with the Morlocks as the Apes. Another one is Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels. Like Gulliver, Taylor is a misanthropist who leaves the civilized world behind and encounters an alien civilization that is a topsy turvy version of our own. Also there was an episode on Twilight Zone that Ron Sterling produce that called ""I Shot an Arrow in the Air"" that very familiar to this film. The acting and make up are great. Edward G. Robertson did the make up test for the movie. It's makes me wonder, how cooler the movie would have been if Edward G. Robertson continue to play Dr. Zaius. The cinematography is great. The whole cornfield scene was expertly shot and directed. The music is catchy and there is great one-liners. There is everything in this movie. Romance, thriller, reality and yes, lots of humor. Still, there is some faults to the film. The science in this science fiction doesn't make sense. It can be a bit hokie or camp at times. The movie is rated G, but it still have foul language and nudity so it can be a bit misleading for parents. There are many implicit ideas in the movie, that the average movie goer may not pick up on, but as far as plot and pacing, you get an exciting thrill ride of action and suspense. Highly recommended.",Planet of the Apes

Even today it still holds pretty well compared to other action adventures. The primate-human reversal is taken a bit too literally, though. Some dialogue intended to be funny is just silly due to this fact. More creativity would have been nice.

60,Rodrigo_Amaro,It gets better and better with the time.,9,3 September 2010,"""Planet of the Apes"" is a great sci-fi film about the perdition of mankind and humans in a society ruled by thinking apes. Human race is obsolete, useless and so weak that now they're dominated by apes who talk like us, fight like us and think like us (or perhaps better if you consider that they're much better than what's left of human).In a distant future Charlton Heston plays the astronaut Taylor and after a failure on his ship he and crew mates end up in a strange place very similar with Earth. While trying to find a way out of this desert and lonely place they discover a few bunch of people who are treated badly by strange figures (the apes) who dominates everything there and they're transformed into slaves. Taylor is able to show some notable abilities that surprises this apes society since humans in this time no longer can speak and he can. Scientists Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Zira (Kim Hunter) are the noble creatures that are stunned with this revelation and they're develop with Taylor a relationship based on knowledge trades, with Taylor telling things about his distant planet and the importance of humans. But things are not so easy and Taylor has to fight with the other monkey authorities (they don't believe in Taylor and they want to kill this ""slave"" of inferior race). Will Taylor find out what's happening? Will Cornelius and Zira trust this man who they thought was inferior to them? Very intriguing!This film was a great hit in the year of its release and it was a very significant and thoughtful work, but it is even more relevant to watch it now. The idea over the evolution of mankind and how many great things were created and achieved but even so people didn't become more humanized or more positive, and this distance was growing bigger between them, everything was so critical and I think the writers of this movie thought that in the future things could become more frightening and desperate for the human race. And if you remember this was released in the same year of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" which means that people back then really thought that the future would be marvelous for the evolution of things but not so much interesting in terms of people's evolution. And what's more interesting of both movies is the fact that they've used in their stories the ape figure, the primal force of the evolution of man, the creature that started all for us and in both movies they're intelligent creatures and their actions always resembles our own actions. With that in mind it only proves the theory of Evolution and people have to accept that bipedal mankind started with monkeys. The last quote of the very last scene is one of the most powerful ever delivered by a character in a sci-fi movie. A warning sign for all generations to take care of our planet and take care of ourselves because evolution can walk backwards. The movie is very good, but if wasn't for too many speeches and theories about humans and the trial and escapes of the hero it would be more fun to watch, especially for the younger generations (since this movie doesn't have too much action and people nowadays demands for action all the time). All the performances are good and the fantastic makeup effects on the actors playing the apes really worked well here. A very good movie that really gets better and better with the time. 9/10",Planet of the Apes
61,tomgillespie2002,"More than fifty years after its release, Planet of the Apes is better than ever",9,13 May 2019,"""You maniacs! You blew it all up! God damn you all to hell!"" The image of the sweaty, bare-chested Charlton Heston beating the floor as the truth finally hits home at the climax of Planet of the Apes is now one of the most iconic moments in cinema history. If you saw the film as a kid, chances are this will be the scene you'll remember, or the famous ""Take your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape!"" line, as Heston's fallen astronaut George Taylor reveals himself as an intelligent being to his simian captors. It's been lovingly parodied through the subsequent decades, and its memory somewhat tarnished by Tim Burton's abysmal 2001 remake, so it's easy to forget just how revolutionary Franklin J. Schaffner's film was for mainstream science-fiction cinema, and just how much it has inspired the genre with its legacy ever since.Astronauts Taylor, Landon (Robert Gunner) and Dodge (Jeff Burton) rest in deep hibernation as their spaceship speeds through the galaxy at light-speed. While the crew have aged just over a year, by the time the craft crashes down on a strange, but seemingly habitable, planet, two thousand years have gone by back on Earth. With no hope in sight, the three space travellers decide to trudge through the deserts of this unknown rock and eventually come across fresh water, stopping for a well-earned bathe despite the ominous presence of crude scarecrows looming over them. When their clothes are stolen, they encounter what appears to be a community of humans, only these are dressed in rags and don't communicate verbally. Out of nowhere, they are raided by figures on horseback, who hunt the fleeing humans to either kill or capture them. The aggressors are rifle-wielding gorillas wearing armour, and Taylor and Landon are ensnared and carried off to Ape City to be studied and experimented on by an intelligent ape society.While it's easy to get caught up in all the action and adventure, it's the social, political and religious observations that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled. Planet of the Apes is the stuff of truly great science-fiction, a genre that allows us to be whisked off to a different time or space that feels oddly close to home. Schaffner's film paints a pretty pessimistic picture of humanity, as Taylor, prior to hibernation, ponders the planet he thinks he'll eventually return to, and whether humanity will have moved on from the conflict-ridden world he was eager to leave behind. The world he is eventually plunged into is much like our own, or is certainly heading that way. Taylor is viewed as a threat, foretold in ancient religious texts that sound suspiciously like our own, while blinkered scientist Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) dismisses the idea of evolution despite the pleas of psychologist Zira (Kim Hunter) and her fiance Cornelius (Roddy McDowall). The Oscar-winning make-up is also staggering, standing shoulder to shoulder with anything from the modern era. More than fifty years after its release, Planet of the Apes is better, and sadly more relevant, than ever. There's a reason this story is still being told.",Planet of the Apes

63,Dr_Coulardeau,A surprisingly good film,10,27 August 2010,"That's the first of a long series of films. At first you think you are in some kind of Star Trek series with a little bit less gadgetry, or maybe a new Space Odyssey. Then you think you have been thrown into a remake of George Pal's Time Machine, adapted from H.G. Wells. But you realize very fast it is quite another story. Instead of implementing Darwinism within a Marxist vision of industrial society, here the very Darwinian evolution that man produced man as superior to apes, we have exactly the world upside down and apes are superior to man. It is an inverted story of human fundamentalist Christianity or any fundamentalist religious belief in the hands and heads of an ape rather medieval society. Some humans arrive in a very long distance NASA flight and they are at first confronted to a wild human species and then hunted down by an ape superior species. That's the beginning. Of course the parallel with H.G. Wells stops here and we shift to another story. The aim is to reveal the absurdity of a fundamentalist belief that one species was created by God to dominate the world and another to be the Devil's spies and pawns. It is not racism since the apes and the humans are not members of the same species. It is what we humans practice everyday on earth, the absolute domination of all that nature contains. What is surprising is that these apes hunt humans, capture them, kill them but do not eat them. In H.G. Wells the Morlocks hunted the Elois in order to eat them as meat, proteins. The next surprising thing is that this dependence, inferiority has erased the capacity to speak in the humans whereas their superiority has granted the apes the power to speak and write. That is surprising since humans do have the physical ability but they lost the know-how. The film is surprising in its ending because it is the triumph of force over reason. The last surviving Earth man and his human female wild acolyte escape enslavement by using force, and the chief scientist and chief religious authority escape truth by using force. The end is all the more surprising when the Statue of Liberty jumps up out of nowhere on this extremely distant planet. Fascinating anachronism. I think they call that, in the intellectual critical milieu, a ""mise en abime"". Of course we know it is the door to the sequel, but even so it is slightly moving to see her in there. Quite out of her normal environment. Maybe some myth is attached to this lady, so strong that on September 11 they attacked the Twin Towers instead of the Statue of Liberty. Surprising indeed what force a mythical being can take in human minds.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID",Planet of the Apes
64,zkonedog,"The Ultimate In Pure, Classic Science Fiction",10,10 March 2017,"Whenever I watch this original ""Planet of the Apes"" effort--and I've done so on multiple occasions to this point in my life--I am struck by how truly it personifies the genre of science fiction in film. Supplemented by some iconic performances, unique visual imagery, groundbreaking makeup/costumes, and sneaky-strong writing, ""Planet of the Apes"" is a tour de force in nearly every regard.For a very basic overview, ""Apes"" focuses on a group of American space explorers led by Taylor (Charlton Heston), who have been floating around the galaxy for thousands of years. When they crash land on a strange planet, however, they find out that the evolutionary system is backwards--apes have evolved from men and rule the ""upside-down civilization"". While ape leader Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) wants to obscure Taylor's presence/importance at all costs, scientist couple Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowell) fight to determine his truth and help him escape the government's clutches.Right off the bat, the look of this film is visually stunning. From the wide open vistas of the early-goings to the ape city/architecture, the cinematography plays as well now as it did in 1968. On every viewing, I am quickly and effortless drawn into that world (much like, say, The Shire of LOTR's Middle Earth).The same can be said for the acting and voice work. Simple things such as the different ways the various classes of primates walk, or their unique vocal inflections, combine to produce even further viewer immersion. It would be easy to look at the entire enterprise as somewhat hokey, but it never comes off as such because all these ""little things"" are so specifically tailored.One must also not forget the overall plot/theme, penned by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling (of Twilight Zone fame). The overall theme of ""Apes"" is actually pretty straightforward: scientific endeavor being squashed by government intrusion, lies, and secrecy. Relevant in '68, and also no less so today. That is the primary reason why this Apes effort stands the test of time while all subsequent installments (some decent, some outright horrible) ultimately can't quite measure up.A final score in the ""all-time classic"" column? A twist ending (that I won't ruin here for the one person living under a rock) that is so perfectly executed that it has now become an iconic cinema moment.I consider ""Planet of the Apes"" to be one of my favorite films of all-time. It takes some imagination to enjoy, for sure, but the writing, performances, and set pieces make that an easy goal to accomplish. The film's simple, yet bitingly accurate, social themes put it over the top in terms of re-watchability.",Planet of the Apes

The irony is that the misanthropic hero must defend the very people he so despised back on his own world (wink, wink). PLANET OF THE APES juxtaposes everything from ANIMAL FARM to Will Rogers, and there are times when the humor gets in the way (as in the infamous trial scene), but the drama is powerful enough to steamroll such minor moments. Charlton Heston is at his peak, here. It's easy to see why Laurence Olivier referred to him as ""the greatest actor in the world."" [Olivier was referring to Heston's stage work, I believe, but the statement could apply just as well to his screen work.] In an age when Koko the gorilla and other apes are now communicating with humans via sign language- and even making up their own words!- the ""far-fetched"" notions found in Pierre Boulle's MONKEY PLANET may not be so far-fetched, after all...",Planet of the Apes

70,Vartiainen,The beginning of something interesting,8,28 June 2015,"The original Planet of the Apes is a strange movie when you think about it. Based on a French novel La Planète des Singes by Pierre Boulle, its plot is ludicrous. A spaceship crashes onto a planet where the surviving crew quickly finds out that the planet is populated and controlled by different kinds of apes, who hold as their slaves a population that looks remarkably like humans. Well... okay, that's kind of forceful with its symbolism and undertone, but okay.To be fair, the film is actually pretty good with its themes and messages. Humans as slaves to a supposedly inferior lifeform is a theme we've seen before, but the film takes its time exploring the idea and its implications. The simian culture is also a fascinating one with heavy undercurrent of religious tyranny, strict cast system and conservative disdain for change. The movie is not really even an action film, or even an adventure one. Conversations take up much of the screen time, and they're good conversations at that. But that's actually fairly normal for a certain type of science fiction.The various characters are also great and it's nice that they showed the apes as people as well, just as capable for good and evil as we are. There are good, sympathetic apes, there are tyrants and then there are those that are neither.The cosmetics are also phenomenal, especially for their time. The ape mask are a little rubbery, but remarkably less so than I would have thought. I can see emotions on their faces almost as easily as I could on humans faces, making them much easier to identify with. The designs are also evocative and all apes are given clear identities. It also helps that their voices are done by some fantastic actors.Charlton Heston is also very good in the leading role and his blight and struggle carry the whole film. One of the great scifi heroes, a gruff survivor exterior hiding a sharp intellect.All in all Planet of the Apes is definitely worth a watch for pretty much everyone. It's intelligent, evocative, exciting and all around thought-provoking, with some great twists in the plot that are sure to keep you interested.",Planet of the Apes

You got in orbit, can a few years later you come back to Earth. Or do you? Three astronauts land back on Earth only to find out that man are the lowest forms of life, and the Apes(Chimpanzees, Orangutans, gorillas, etc.) are the majority of the population. George Taylor(Charton Heston, 1923-2008), and his crew have their clothes stolen and are captured by these apes. Taylor is shot in the neck and is unable to prove himself that he's not one of them primal humans. Only a duo of chimps: Zira and Cornelius are more curious about Taylor than any of the other apes around. The part I didn't like is where Taylor got hosed by one of the apes and when he tried to speak the ape said, ""SHUT UP, YOU FREAK!"" It is slightly funny, but in reality it's not. It was just a scene, nothing to get all hot about. I enjoyed it very much, at least we don't go round calling each other banana breath! HAHAHAHAHA!!

When the astronaut emerge from a deep sleep, the three males, Captain George Taylor (Charlton Heston), Landon (Robert Gunner) and Dodge (Jeff Burton) discover the female astronaut dead due to a break in the sleeping chamber.The ship crashes into a remote lake on a unknown planet. The three trek across a desolate land until they come upon a race of seemingly primitive people who take little notice of the newcomers. Suddenly the group, including the astronauts, are attacked by a force of apes who are advanced to the point of being able to speak and fire weapons. In the confusion, Dodge is killed and Taylor and Landon captured and Taylor wounded.They are taken to the Ape's compound where they are separated. Taylor due to his wound, is unable to speak. He tries to communicate with behavioral scientist Dr. Ziva (Kim Hunter) who realizes that he is different from the others. She pairs him up with Nova (Linda Harrison) one of the ""humans"" to see what will happen. Elder Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) is not impressed and wants to operate on Taylor's brain as was the case with Landon who is now a hopeless mutant.Taylor manages to escape briefly and discovers that he has his voice back which impresses Zira and her fiancé Cornelius (Roddy McDowwell) but not Dr. Zaius. Taylor is brought before the Assembly presided over by a President (James Whitmore) and comprising Dr. Zaius and Honorius (James Daley). Both Zira and Cornelius are convicted of heresy and Taylor is ear marked for ""corrective surgery"" by Dr. Zaius.With the help od Julius (Buck Kartalian), Taylor, Ziva and Cornelius flee the compound and go to the ""Forbidden Zone"". Cornelius had been there previously and had discovered evidence of a previous race of superior beings. Dr. Zaius arrives on the scene and is shocked to discover an artifact that proves the existence of a previous race.

""",10,26 July 2009,"Across the centuries of time, we hear that the fantastic on one planet is common nature on another. When this incredible novel was first penned by Pierre Boulle, few if any ever thought it would be food for thought at a war conference in Germany by the NATO allies. The story is nothing short of superbly incredible as that is what happens to the United States astronauts who return to Earth 2000 years after they left. Upon landing, their leader George Taylor (Charlton Heston) a cynical and introspective man from the 20th century explains why he left Earth. "" I've always felt there has to be something better than man. "" Upon discovering he has emerged in a society run by Apes, he believes he is in a living nightmare. The ape society is primitive and structured much like early man. Two 'doctors' (Roddy McDowall) as Cornelius and (Kim Hunter) as Zira heal him but discover their 'animal' specimen whom they call Bright Eyes, explains he is an astronaut and comes from the planet Earth. However if Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans), James Whitmore and James Daly have their way, he will be lobotomized. Linda Harrison plays Nova, Jeff Burton is Dodge and Robert Gunner is Landon.

Nobody thought it was sexist of Mr C.Heston to soliloquise about his love life back on Planet Earth or for the lady astronaut to be utilised as a brood mare.Today his speech seems embarrassingly inappropriate,something that Sammy Cahn might have written for Frank Sinatra at his most priapic. Indeed many of his pensees have a toe - curling quality that even forty years ago seemed a bit naff.He may be an unlikeable figure to 21st century viewers,but his brand of misanthropic cynicism was considered smart and trendy in its time.Remember Lenny Bruce,Mort Sahl,Don Rickles, Pauline Kael and the ""Let's go dressed as the Sick Soul of America"" parties? So whilst LBJ burned hundreds of babies before breakfast Hollywood made a movie about a planet ruled by monkeys.Only in America,folks. POTA has suffered the fate of any movie transformed into a cult(apart from being referred to only by its initials)in that it has come to mean whatever it's proponents want it to mean.It's anti - religion,anti - Darwin,anti - racist,anti - war,anti - imperialist,anti whatever you've got this week......it won't be long before some bright spark discovers a Gay sub - text,you mark my words.This is a great pity for someone who just wants to enjoy the movie per se without the political agenda subsequently thrust upon it. Sure it's a parable,but parables don't have to sledgehammered home.Ignore the aftermarket propaganda and basically you have an interesting and disconcerting take on a theme much used in 1950s Science Fiction. Mr Heston is magisterial as the stranded astronaut and spokesman for his time.He is the Noble Savage incarnate.However,in a remarkable performance Miss K.Stanley transcends her facial prosthesis,subtly suggesting deep intelligence and awareness with a few eye movements and gestures.She,ironically is by far the most ""human"" character in the movie(in a non species - specific way,naturally). You may find fault with the 1968 attitudes,but don't be blind to the movie's many merits. Extreme Apeys may be comforted by the fact that there are only 1970 years to go before Mr Heston's crew are due to land.Book your place in the front row now.",Planet of the Apes
75,ackstasis,"""Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others""",8,26 December 2010,"This is one of those movies you tend to avoid because you expect it to be cheesy and dated. Spread the word, fellow humans – 'Planet of the Apes (1968)' is actually quite an intelligent sci-fi! John Chamber's make-up effects are still pretty good, even though the actors underneath have difficulty showing their emotion. The work was certainly deserving of an Honorary Oscar, though it beats me why the similar, superior ape make-up in '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)' was completely ignored by the Academy.'Planet of the Apes' opens with a monologue by Charlton Heston that immediately reminded me of Rod Serling's narration for every episode of ""The Twilight Zone."" My suspicions were confirmed when Serling came up as co-screenwriter during the opening credits. In fact, the film revisits some of the ideas previously explored in ""The Twilight Zone,"" particularly the Season 1 episodes ""I Shot An Arrow into the Air"" (three astronauts crash-land on a distant planetary body) and ""People Are Alike All Over"" (a visit to Mars distorts the conventional biological hierarchy).Astronaut Taylor (Heston) and two colleagues land on a distant planet after travelling forward several thousand years in time. They cross a desolate wasteland, but eventually come across life: a tribe of primitive mute humans, and a dominant civilisation of highly-evolved apes. For narrative convenience, these apes speak perfect English, with fragments of 1960s hippie-slang occasionally thrown in.Taylor is arrested by the apes, subjected to scientific testing, and his legitimacy as an intelligent being is put on trial. The ape society, falling into familiar twentieth-century traps, refuses to believe that apes may conceivably have evolved from Man, and clings stubbornly to their belief in sacred ""Scriptures."" This portion of the film resembles a bizarre reversal of the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial. I found the screenplay, by Serling and Michael Wilson, rather clever. It gets us barracking for Taylor as a representative of Mankind (the natural human reaction), and then unexpectedly switches its moral compass, suggesting that perhaps Mankind doesn't deserve to survive. The ending, even though I knew it was coming, is still a remarkably powerful moment. Rarely has Serling's distaste for humans and their propensity for destruction been so profound.",Planet of the Apes

77,Fluke_Skywalker,No monkey business here. This is a classic,8,24 January 2017,"Plot; Three astronauts crash land on a planet where simians are the dominant species and man is considered a beast beneath contempt.At first blush it would be easy to dismiss the original Planet of the Apes as a dystopian sci-fi relic from the genre's golden age, or to lump it in with its lesser (though not always bad) sequels. But join Charlton Heston's cynical Taylor as he's dropped off into this ""Madhouse"" and you learn to appreciate just how smart, well made and well crafted this film is. There are a lot of themes in play here--race, class, reason vs. faith--but like any good allegorical story, it doesn't beat you over the head with them. At its core it's about a man who has become embittered by mankind's seeming inability to overcome its base nature, and yet when his own humanity is denied him, he gains a new appreciation for just what it means to be human. But then we get the twist. The power of the twist is not the shock value, or subterfuge merely for the sake of it, but because just as Taylor has learned to value his own humanity, he's delivered this gut punch that seems to validate that original cynicism.I also have to take note of the cast. Hidden beneath restrictive latex masks, actors Maurice Evans, Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall manage to give compelling and believable performances. You never question the ""reality"" of their characters because they don't. But this is a film carried in large part by Charlton Heston. Never one for subtlety, Heston's bold performance style lifts this small-scaled film into something much, much larger than it would've otherwise have been.",Planet of the Apes
78,JasparLamarCrabb,Monkey Planet,10,25 May 2014,"An exceptionally well-made science fiction masterpiece directed by Franklin J. Schaffner. Three astronauts land on a planet many light years from Earth and find themselves in an upside down evolutionary nightmare with chimps, gorillas and orangutans ruling. Charlton Heston, playing nearly the entire film at such a level that he seems ready to explode at any moment, is the lead spaceman with Kim Hunter & Roddy McDowell are the sympathetic scientist chimps who help him escape the clutches of a power mad government stooge (played by the great Maurice Evans as an orangutan). The film is entertaining from beginning to end and as horrifying as its premise is, it's not without humor, poking fun at the generation gap (it's 1968!) as well as government bureaucrats (note the way in which the assembly refuses to even listen to Hunter & McDowell as they plead to save Heston). Despite the heavy make-up, the performances by Hunter & McDowell really shine through. They're great, as is Evans in one of his rare film roles. James Daly, James Whitmore and Lou Wagner (hilarious as Hunter's rebellious nephew) all don John Chambers' impressive ape make-up. The creepy, now classic music score is by Jerry Goldsmith and the script was worked on by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling. It's based, very loosely, on Pierre Boulle's novel.

79,jimbo-53-186511,"""Take your hands off me you damn dirty ape""",9,21 April 2016,"Having watched both Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes and Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes recently I decided to re-watch this original version and see how it actually stacks up against the more 'modern' equivalents of the story. On the whole I have to say I was very impressed with it and I can easily see why a lot of people enjoyed it...In many ways this version of TPOTA is just a straight-forward adventure film albeit with possible subtexts about the old adage of 'all things being created equal'. The reversal here whereby apes are more intelligent than humans does make the film both amusing and interesting throughout its running time. I did find it quite funny to watch a film that seemed to go to town in making man seem really stupid (in this case Charlton Heston is made to appear to be as dumb as all the other humans when in actuality he can't speak because his vocal chords were damaged when he was attacked). Although it's clearly a fantasy film I did like the way that the film did address the issue of whether Charlton Heston's character should or could be considered as being an equal to the apes - this made it feel as though the writers had put both care and thought into the film and made it both satisfying as an adventure film and as a social critique on society (albeit in a fantasy setting).It's clear when watching this film in 2016 that it does look a little dated now and it certainly isn't as pretty to look at as later films. However, it is still satisfying in almost every other area. It is well-paced, it offers a fairly interesting exploration between humans and apes. The end of the film seemed a bit strange at first and the way I looked at it was that although Taylor was able to prove that man existed before apes it's very much suggested that the apes may have got the last laugh. An interesting shall we say open-ended conclusion to a very enjoyable film.Complaints I have with the film are few and far between and the only aspect of the film that probably could have been improved upon were parts of the narrative; we're not really given much information about the planet that the astronauts arrive on and we're not afforded a great deal of information about the way that humans and apes have evolved on this planet. In some ways this makes TPOTA a difficult film to make an emotional invest in and it's fortunate really that it is very strong in every other area.Many people regard this film as a classic and now that I've seen it again I can fully understand why it's regarding with such esteem.",Planet of the Apes

He is a cynic who hates mankind enough to make him leave the Earth in search of ""something better than man."" Heston tries to make sense of this ""upside-down"" world, and in the process, Pierre Boulle raises such issues as balance of power, racism, the role of government, and evolution... The apes are seen with cameras and guns, but strangely, the sight of a paper airplane shocks them...Schaffner's ability to focus on the human element in the face of awesome spectacle is one of his greatest assets... He uses dizzying camera effects, very enthusiastic zooming and hand-held cameras at ground level during chases...""Planet of the Apes"" is a magnificent visual experience, from the emerald lake at the beginning to the threatening sea-shore at the end... The desolate landscapes of the Utah and Arizona National Parks, represented into primeval ruins, make an appropriately setting for the first appearance of the talking apes, rounding up humans like animals... The apes themselves remain an astonishing achievement of make-up and performance... John Chambers receives an Academy Award for his art...The motion picture features one of Heston's strongest, most emotional performances... Heston escapes, fights and yells... He is violently treated, caged, dragged, and hosed with powerful jets of water... He runs barefoot through hills, mountains, plains and an ape city... He is raided by gorillas on foot and on horseback, humiliated by thoughtful chimpanzees and mad ape scientists, pelted by inhabitants of the Planet of the Apes...The terrific supporting cast is wholly convincing: Maurice Evans in the role of Zaius, the scientist who does not want his race to suffer the fate of the humans; the two friendly chimpanzees named Zira and Cornelius (Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall) are superb...""Planet of the Apes"" also gives us something else:-Heston and his crewmen have landed on an unknown planet... They hear sounds of galloping horses and guns being fired... But what they see is incredible... Apes on horseback!""Bright Eyes"" does surprise the apes who believe humans aren't capable... With those enraged words (""Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty apes!""), he shakes the entire foundation of ape society and causes the Semians to retreat in shock...The crucial scene where Taylor has been given a hearing: As he tries to explain to his captors that he's come from another planet in a spaceship, the scene cuts to the monkey tribunal - sitting in the classic ""hear-no-evil, speak-no-evil, see-no-evil - pose...When a shaved Taylor kisses Zira in front of Cornelius who is suffering without complaining... An indecisive Zira expresses: ""Allright. But you're so damned ugly!""The ultimate scene: Having finally escaped from his captors with his mate Nova (Linda Harrison), Heston rides along the beach on horseback to the Forbidden Zone, once a paradise... Suddenly he spots something unusual in the distance... He remembers what Zaius told him, ""You may not like what you find!"" What he can see was not a rock but salt-stained metal... As he draws closer, the camera slowly draws back and up to reveal what must come as a terrible shock... Backed by a magnificent and unusual Jerry Goldsmith musical score, ""Planet of the Apes"" is a stylish and thoughtful science fiction film, which starts and finishes splendidly...

82,JoeKarlosi,Planet of the Apes (1968) ****,10,10 March 2013,"One of the greatest science fiction masterpieces of all time, superbly directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, with an intelligent and thought-provoking script co-written by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling (creator of ""The Twilight Zone""). It's the story of a bitter, cynical astronaut named Taylor (Charlton Heston) who despises 20th Century Earth and its people so much that he abandons his planet in a spacecraft with three other crew members (one is a woman who does not survive the flight). The ship enters a time warp and crash lands on a strange planet over two thousand years away from home, which Taylor learns is controlled by intelligent, civilized chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans, while human beings are nothing more than mute and savage beasts. Taylor and his comrades are hunted and captured by the gorillas, and then become separated. Having been shot in his throat during the hunt, Taylor is unable to speak to defend himself as the supreme conservative orangutan Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) deems him as a threat to this simian society. Only through the liberal efforts of two pacifist chimps Cornelius and Zira (Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter) can Taylor hope to find his freedom in a world turned upside down, while he is now forced to defend Man as a species.There is so much to recommend about this movie, beginning with Charlton Heston's excellent performance. Kudos must be given to John Chambers' incredible ape makeups, as well as Jerry Goldsmith's other-worldly alien score. All the ape actors are superb in their parts, with Maurice Evans (Zaius), Kim Hunter (Zira), Roddy McDowall (Cornelius), and James Whitmore (as the council leader). The brilliant script works as a sometimes terrifying, occasionally endearing, politically motivated commentary on race relations, yet with the occasional lightness for comedy. PLANET OF THE APES was so successful upon its release that it spawned four sequels, two TV series, at least two reboots, and a legion of Apeaholic young fans like myself, who would go on to collect all sorts of toys, games, bubblegum cards, action figures, magazines, and a plethora of other merchandising -- and all of this well before STAR WARS ever came along.

85,ShootingShark,Get Your Stinking Paws Off Me You Damned Dirty Ape !,7,13 January 2011,"Four astronauts are sent on a mission through hyperspace and are due to rendezvous back with Earth hundreds of years after they left. But something goes wrong and they crash-land on a mysterious planet with no idea where or when they are. Things get worse still when they are captured by strange bipedal talking ape-like creatures who seem to be the dominant race. Can Taylor, the lead astronaut, escape from this madness ?This science-fiction classic is one of the most thought-provoking films of the sixties, as well as being an exciting and gripping adventure story. It manages that rare trick of being great escapist entertainment but also postulating about so many interesting ideas - racism, evolution, theology, apocalypse, to name but a few. It's adapted from a clever book by French author Pierre Boulle, but was originally scripted by Rod Serling, in my view perhaps the greatest screenwriter of his generation, and I think it's from him that the intelligence, humanity, imagination and bitter irony which make it such a rich movie come from. The beach scene ending is of course hugely famous, and its impact is as profound as ever, but the speech Dr Zaius precedes it with sums up all of mankind's worst attributes neatly and is in its own way just as memorable. Special mention must also go to John Chambers' outstanding makeup work in bringing the simian characters to life - the ape masks and design set a new benchmark for movie effects and they are so good that within two scenes we forget what we are watching and start responding to Dr Zira as a character, not a creature. If at all possible, try to see this in widescreen, as the Panavision photography by Leon Shamray is outstanding throughout; the Lake Powell Utah desert vistas are stunning, and the shot compositions - such as the amusing see-no-evil-hear-no-evil-speak-no-evil tableau at the hearing - are terrific. There is also a scary blaring score by Jerry Goldsmith, which adds immeasurably to the tension. A huge hit, both critically and commercially, this film was followed by four sequels, a TV show, a cartoon and a perhaps ill-advised remake by Tim Burton in 2001 with a resolution so inscrutable I don't think anyone understands it. I've always thought Charlton Heston should have got a special award for keeping sci-fi movies alive in the doldrums - he followed this with two other great flicks - The Omega Man and Soylent Green. This one is the best of the three though, and a top-notch thinking-man's action picture from start to finish.",Planet of the Apes
86,rbverhoef,Much better than the remake,9,13 February 2004,"The original 'Planet of the Apes' is better than the 2001 remake on almost every level. May be Tim Burton's version looks better, no wonder with Burton as the director, but the direction itself, the cinematography, the story and the performances in Franklin J. Schaffner's original are much better and more interesting.Heston is Taylor, who crashes with his spaceship on what seems to be a deserted planet. He and two other survivors start searching for life. They run into other human beings, and at that time they are all attacked by apes. The apes speak English, the human beings are mute. In this society a human being is what apes are in our society. Animals, nothing more. The humans are taken for research, Taylor as well, and since he is shot in the neck he is not able to talk at first. One of his fellow survivors is dead, what happened to the other is unsure. A female ape who is a scientist discovers that Taylor understands her, and even thinks he can talk. Of course this is not what the high people in this society want to hear.The movie has some very interesting elements. Worlds are upside down, as Taylor says, and in a way the movie puts a mirror in front of us. The human beings are humiliated in exactly the way we treat animals. What would we do if another mammal suddenly knew how to speak our language? We would probably react the same as the apes do in this movie and therefore it is even more interesting.In liked the movie very much, and some very nice moments in particular. Early in the movie Taylor gets a woman in his cage. He calls her Nova (Linda Harrison). We know what the apes want, and it is funny because it is exactly how we do this kind of stuff to our animals. The apes are even surprised when Taylor wants to keep his woman, and therefore seems monogamous.With some nice touches, a great and famous ending, some quotes that will sound very familiar, Charlton Heston as a pretty good leading man, a score from Jerry Goldsmith that is perfect for a movie like this, nice direction and a fine cinematography by Leon Shamroy this movie is a very good classic.",Planet of the Apes

Back then at 8 years old I wasn't a Twilight Zone or Outer Limits aficionado like she was so it didn't spoil it for me but I've often wondered since how many people she did ruin it for! I also still wonder how dense Taylor (excellently played by Charlton Heston) was supposed to be to never wonder why the apes were speaking English!US space ship launched optimistically in 1972 travels to the outer reaches of the galaxy in 2006 Earth years, landing on a strange world of photogenic rocks under impossibly blue skiesand talking apes. The terse Heston is suitably unimpressed with his new situation, and is even left bereft of words for a time while he was finding his feet. He makes some important scientific friends (Drs Zira and Cornelius), showing inter-species amity is possible if not intra-. Roddy McDowell's finest performance is here, bar none. Heston's aim is to escape the clutches of the apes and make a new life in the puzzling new world for him and his ultra-demure mate. Another plus in this and the entire series is the continuous homage it pays to the adventures of Edgar Rice Burroughs, who imho wrote some of the most important SF books ever. Beautiful photography, excellent cost effective sets and a marvellous storyline make this a memorable film, one that still holds up well after all these Earth decades have passed since blast off – watching it I can hardly believe it was filmed in the Summer Of Love. From memory all of the sequels presented a steady decline in quality, but over the decades the franchise has been surprisingly resilient, with cgi cartoonery and gamers now taking it up.After witnessing much ape-like behaviour by humans over the years I wonder now about definitions used! However, it's powerful and thought provoking, with probably the best ending of any film ever made.",Planet of the Apes
88,a_chinn,Imperfect film is still an undeniable sci-fi classic,8,7 October 2017,"Charlton Heston is part of a crew of astronauts who crash land on a planet where monkeys and apes have evolved into the dominant species and humans are the wild, mute creatures living in the wilderness. Written by Rod Serling, legendary host and creator of ""The Twilight Zone,"" the film is fascinating science fiction that works on the surface as straightforward entertainment but also works on a subtextual level, raising questions about evolution, animal cruelty, and humanity's inclination towards war. My only complaints about the film are that the opening scenes in the desert seem to drag on for quite a while and don't serve to forward the story. Also, the films final scenes are rather slow paced and overly talky. SPOILER ALERT! Now I do love the extended scenes of Heston and Nova's surreal horseback ride along the beach before his surprise discovery (""You Maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell!""), but it's the scenes preceding this in the archaeological dig site that seemed rather slow, though I do quite enjoy Heston's lecturing of Dr. Zaius (""Doctor, would an ape make a human doll that TALKS?"" - although my kids have many talking animal toys, so it's a bit of an invalid argument, though no one can argue the point if Charlton Heston is shouting it at you.). Despite occasional pacing issues, Serling and director Franklin J. Schaffner (""Patton"" ""Papillon"") create a world that becomes increasingly rich and fascinating as the film goes on. An imperfect film, but an undeniable classic, as well as a significant pop culture touchstone.",Planet of the Apes

This is a movie that I have seen many times, and I never tire of it. It has so much to think about in the dialog that to not have it in your consciousness shows a severe lack of movie knowledge.This film illustrates the lengths to which the religious right will go to deny scientific truth. They, like the apes, refuse to accept any evidence contrary to their hardened minds and dismiss it as hogwash.They will go to their graves without understanding the magnificence of this world, dreaming of some fantasy land to sooth their ignorance.This was a perfect role for Charlton Heston. His manner shows through in his characterization and makes the film. Kim Hunter, Roddy McDowall, and newcomer Linda Harrison all contributed to a classic that is among the best movies of all time.45 years later, the ending never ceases to amaze.",Planet of the Apes
90,davidmvining,Great science fiction,10,31 August 2020,"In retrospect, the great twist at the end of the very first Planet of the Apes movie feels incredibly telegraphed. There are clues everywhere about the nature of the world that George Taylor, astronaut, finds himself on, but the biggest key is the thematic focus of the entire movie up until that moment. If the ending wasn't what it was, then the journey that the man at the center of the tale finds himself on would have little to nothing to do with the man himself as he's portrayed in the opening thirty minutes. Once you realize that the story has to have something to do with Taylor and his view of the humanity, it doesn't feel like there could be any other ending possible. It just fits too well.So, four astronauts have gone into deep space, and six months into their journey they're going into cryosleep. Going at speeds approaching the speed of light, time outside of their spaceship moves faster, and the clocks onboard say that hundreds of years have passed. The ship crash lands as all four sleep into a lake that quickly takes the ship and one deceased crewmember with it under the water. The three survivors walk across the barren desert, having seen almost nothing of the ship's readings of the planet, and struggle to survive. Up through the appearance of the apes, this opening is the movie at its best. It embraces the feeling of isolation, weirdness, and difference of life on another planet far from home really well, using large stretches of almost silent action that feel off-putting, especially with the atonal score by Jerry Goldsmith.They find a group of mute humans, get rounded up by the dominant species of the planet, apes, and Taylor not only gets separated from his two companions, one of whom dies in the action, he also gets shot in the throat eliminating his ability to speak. Once the movie moves into the ape laboratory, it seems to lose something. Gone is the weird sense of foreboding, replaced by a more mundane look at another culture with heavy parallels to contemporary society, especially around certain questions of faith and evolution. Why go into the particulars of the ape society? Touching on the caste system, the religion, and how science is conducted all with the backdrop of ape treatment of humanity ever-present? Well, it ultimately all feeds into Taylor's own views of humanity that he espoused both to himself and to his crewmates at the beginning of the film.There's no heavy-handedness of Taylor fighting for the rights of his fellow humans, he just fights for his own right to exist. On his side are Zira and Cornelius, two chimpanzees, one of whom studies humans and the other whom studies archaeology. Against him is Doctor Zaius, an orangutan and the Minister of Science. Taylor's mere existence throws the existing order of ape society into disorder. Their sacred texts do not allow for the evolution of ape from man, and they often speak of man being brutish, untamable beasts. Taylor, who would have agreed with Zaius in the beginning if talking about humanity as a whole, must fight the idea that he is of that same race, prone to the same violence. He always wanted to be apart from humanity, giving him the reason for his deep space adventure in the beginning, but faced with the reality that he's being judged for humanity's failings and he's going to pay for them, he has to fight back and stick up for the humanity he ran from.That level of character work at the movie's center never really occurred to me until this viewing. In fact, as I was watching this for the first time in probably ten years, I was actually put off by the extended hour between Taylor's capture and his escape at the hands of Zira towards the Forbidden Zone. It felt, at first glance, like Taylor had wandered into some other movie, and the particulars of ape society didn't seem to be all that important. However, I kept watching with this understanding that there must have been something, and it quickly dawned on me. It also made me wonder about the big reveal at the end.So, Taylor has made his defense of humanity at an archaeological site that showed ancient humanity's advances over ape, and he walks away still confident of his race's superiority. Zaius immediately has the site destroyed, confident of his own beliefs in humanity's faults and that Taylor would find the truth of humanity's history out there beyond the Forbidden Zone. And, of course, he does. He finds the Status of Liberty, a hulk sticking out of the sand in one of the great movie endings of all time. Like all great twists, it was guessable and makes the audience rethink the movie that came before it. And boy, does the ending seem guessable. Ignoring the parts about apes speaking and writing English, the timelines of ape society match rather well with the two-thousand-year gap between the ship's departure and crashing. Hearing that an ape society grew about twelve hundred years before the events of the movie seems like a small time for a society to grow to this point in normal terms, but if it were a branch of something that came before, it seems much more believable. And, of course, if it was just another planet with apes and humans without any connection to the humanity we know, then what's the point of the emotional journey that Taylor goes on? It would feel like a waste.This movie really has stood the test of time, and it's not because it has some great quotes or a great twist ending. It's well anchored by a great central character and journey, elevated by Charlton Heston giving a surprisingly committed performance while dressed in rags. It explores a central idea and treats its character's path with surprising cynicism and cruelty, one of the traits of 60s and 70s science fiction that I find quite appealing. It's a classic for a reason, and it's not the reason most people point to.",Planet of the Apes
91,p-stepien,The Rise of the Orang-Utan,7,21 December 2013,"The timeless sci-fi classic of a space mission returning to Earth only to end up on a mysterious planet, where the other primates have evolved to become the masters of the subordinate human race, needs no real introduction. The key character remains astronaut George Taylor (memorable role by Charlton Heston), who crash-lands on this alien world only to find himself quickly subjugated and caged as unwilling slave labour of the inferior species, while the remaining two members of his crew quickly meet an untimely end. Struggling to speak due to a throat injury sustained during capture, George watches on in awe and disgust at the society he finds himself in, his sole allies are two chimpanzees - the animal psychologist Zira (Kim Hunter) and archaeologist Cornelius (Roddy McDowall), who quickly notice the man's inherent intelligence. As George Taylor attempts to communicate, more sinister forces come into play, as their superior, the orangutan named Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans), obviously knows more than he is willing to reveal...Based on the same-titled novel by Pierre Boulle, ""The Planet of the Apes"" has aged admirably well, even though the plastic facials of the apes, chimps and orangutans takes some of the sparkle of the final product. Nonetheless the entire ordeal remains captivating throughout, rife with tension and social commentary, that covers the underlying depth of the story. At times these may seem a bit heavy-handed by todays standards, as the evident reference to racial issues in the United States have become much more complex, than during the movie's production period. This undoubtedly makes the courtroom scene, where the fate of George Taylor is to be determined, seem inexplicably crass, lacking an immortal subtlety. Nonetheless, the story still molds together nicely, still making the audacious twists and turns near the movies end as delightful as back in the day (even if the last scenes intensity has dropped significantly, due to its technical deficiencies).It is without a doubt that certain standards of movie-making have improved markedly, since the Franklin J. Schaffner classic, with the most key being the linguistic issues. The use of English as a lingua nova on a pan-galactic scale in a movie, where language constitutes a key plot point of the story, really brings about an awkward sense of incredulity to ""Planet of the Apes"". Back in the days maybe this issue could have been overlooked, but in hindsight this constitutes a major plot-hole, that proves extremely distracting from the overall reception of the movie. Are we really supposed to believe that George Taylor never once questioned why he is able to speak in or understand the language of his captors? A slightly more comprehensive script would best have utilised Pierre Boulle and have Taylor learn this language he does not understand.",Planet of the Apes
92,alexanderdavies-99382,Still the best film out of all the ones that followed.,10,27 May 2017,"""Planet of the Apes"" is still one of the most original and creative films within the last 50 years and one of the most creative. From the moment the film was given the green light and right through to the preview screening, there was always a concern that the final results would be greeted with derision. Happily, this was not the case. Audiences in 1968 had never seen anything like ""Planet of the Apes."" It is one of those films that could have become quite a different one if writer and dramatist, Rod Serling had had his screenplay used. In the end, some of his work remains in the final screenplay that was re-written. Quite rightly, Rod Serling's name is on the film's credits. The novel on which the film is based, is fairly similar in plotting but has a different ending and several key moments from the book differ from those in the film. The author, Pierre Boulle, was somewhat reticent in allowing his book to be adapted for the big screen. The reason he gave, was that he felt the novel - titled ""Monkey Planet"" - was one of his lesser works and he didn't take his book seriously. It was the star power of Charlton Heston that convinced Hollywood that the film could be made as a serious bit of cinema. A screen test was commissioned by the studio that agreed to produce the film - ""20th Century Fox."" The test took place in 1966 and lasts for about 10 minutes. The noted actor, Edward G. Robinson was originally cast as scientist Dr. Zauis but due to a heart condition and not being able to withstand the rather arduous make-up sessions, he had to withdraw from the film. I find that to be a pity as his version of the character would have been an asset to the film. The portrayal given by Edward G. Robinson is a more calm and thoughtful one in comparison with that of Maurice Evans's more bombastic performance. The budget of the film had to be reduced in order to be made. The ape make- up was by far the most important aspect of the budget as it was felt by all concerned that the ape characters had to be believable and convincing. The overall scale, as depicted from the original sketches that showed large theatres and halls, was considered to be too expensive and time- consuming. In addition, the idea of apes using highly advanced technology was dropped for the same reasons. Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter excel as the two scientists who slowly believe in the existence of man. Charlton Heston was ideally cast as the character who has to adjust to all the events that unfold during the film, not to mention having to fight in order to survive the fate that has been bestowed to him by the apes. The ending still carries a powerful punch and is quite shocking. The first shot of the apes at the beginning is rather startling as they are kept hidden from the viewer's gaze for a few moments. When they are seen for the first time, the moment has been carefully built up. The writing contains the kind of dialogue that any actor can sink his/her teeth into and the script doesn't disappoint. The script is insightful, imaginative and a clear reflection of how mankind treats his own planet. The direction is some of the best I've seen, as is the photography. The director knows how to create the right mood and atmosphere. The music also adds a great deal to the film - it's slightly off centre compositions suit the film very well. A lot depended upon ""Planet of the Apes"" being a success. Thank goodness it was! All the hard work had paid off. The 1968 film is still the definitive one in every way and is unmatched. A masterpiece of cinema.",Planet of the Apes
93,eric262003,A Classic Film Released During a Dreadful Time Period,9,13 December 2011,"The year 1968 was a rough time period for Americans and even by me saying it, is a complete understatement. It was a time in which American youth after graduating from high school were automatically drafted off to Vietnam to fight in Vietnam in a war that had no real purpose; plus these kids had no real military experience. Two very iconic leaders who were the potential guiding light of hope Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Presidential Candidate Robert F. Kennedy were shot and killed by a random act of hatred. There was turmoil at the Nation Convention in Chicago. Women burning their bras in their quest for equal rights and plenty more. Science and Technology was becoming more enhanced usurping general knowledge. But in the summer of 1968, a blockbuster film hit the big screen, set the tone of the trials and tribulations of the civil pandemonium that has plagued the United States in that time frame. Of course I'm talking about the science fiction classic ""The Planet of the Apes"". The setting of the story was set in the year 1973 where our journey starts with four astronauts lead by Col. George Taylor (Charlton Heston). The Colonel was at his wit's end with the dying of humanity and how far we've turned out (and not necessarily a good thing at that) so to get away from us miscreants, he decides to embark on a journey with NASA. We flash forward to a spaceship collides to a rocky hill and a dark planet with very little forestation. When one of the astronauts gets killed on the way, Col. Taylor and the other cadets make a narrow escape as the ship sinks into oblivion. At first glance, the space cadets make the assumption that they have landed on the planet Bellatrix of the Orion constellation. Further exploration, the cadets notice that the humans on this planet are voiceless and have a primitive thing going for them. During their exploring another two cadets were killed by a group of simians and Col. Taylor was being held prisoner by these superior primates. But once he starts talking, he becomes more acquainted with two simian doctors and a young simian child, he is able to show that he is equal in intelligence with the other apes. Even though he can talk and strike a conversation with the other primates, it also leads up to bit of paranoia towards them. So Dr. Cornelius and Dr. Zira and her nephew Lucius, help Col. Taylor and a mutual female named Nova (cliched name I suppose) sets them free and hides out in a vast desert known as the Forbidden Zone, where remains of the human race were discovered and a surprise revelation manifests itself that will both shock Taylor and the audience as well. ""Planet of the Apes"" magically sets the tone as being one of the original space operas as star Chalton Heston puts it. Asdide from that analysis, it is to this day one of the great films that revolutionized the summer blockbuster definition. It's not only one dimensional in purpose to entertain, but it also makes you want to think as well, so don't put your mind to sleep in this movie folks. It looks into the problems that human society has faced back then and still reflects possibly even more to this day. Charlton Heston was custom-made for the role of Col. Taylor, a man possessed with a disgruntled and cynical disdain for the human race, but was chosen as an unlikely Savior to them. Legendary British performers Roddy McDowall and Maurice Evans shine in their supporting performances as the likable Cornelius and the shrill human-hating Dr. Zaius. The female performances by Kim Hunter and Linda Harrison were excellent as Zira and Nova. The soundtrack compliments the scenery and the emotions spectacularly by Jerry Goldsmith. And hats off for Rod Serling and Michael Wilson for writing a terrific script. And until the ultimate twist in the end we can understand the misanthrope that has plagued the mind of Col. Taylor.I would ask you all to see this movie over the Tim Burton rehashing anytime soon. It's never too late. I guarantee, it will leave you amazed and astounded as well.",Planet of the Apes
94,winner55,not easily forgotten,8,29 September 2007,"An odd film that is hard to dislike, even though there is much wrong with it. It is pretentious; Heston's performance is way over the top; hints at attraction between ape and human more than a little embarrassing; the satirical element is unsubtle and obvious.Yet for all this, ""Planet of the Apes"" is true to the original story by Pierre Boulle, and that saves the day: Boulle's story is more allegory than metaphor - intended to confront its audience rather than suggesting to it; and it does itself wear its satirical elements on its sleeve. And the story, just as story, is very neatly packaged - it's hard not to feel for the major players in this film, but the story moves too quickly to wallow in its undoubted tendency to over-sentimentalize. In the last analysis, we identify wholly with Heston's astronaut: we want to know what the real scoop is, and are willing to give up a lot, and suffer a bit, to join him in this discovery.Filmed with dash, very nicely yet ruggedly designed, with fine performances from all simians involved, this is at the very least high ""Saturday Matinée"" entertainment, and one not easily forgotten.",Planet of the Apes

Planet of Apes spawned franchises, toys, model kits and basically was the blue print for the Star Wars juggernaut that came around a decade later. A brilliant movie with one of the greatest endings ever, it simply has withstood the test of time. The entire cast is as near perfect as a cast can be. This film allows one to suspend their disbelief - for instance why isn't Taylor shocked that the apes speak English? Doesn't matter. Maybe he's in shock. Who cares? What matters is that this movie works on EVERY SINGLE level. With an absolutely superb screenplay by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling (who lifts the death of Stewart from his own Twilight Zone Episode, The Solid Gold Caper) and one of the greatest shock endings (parodied often) in cinema history, this was a classic from it's first screening and it's a classic today.

96,sme_no_densetsu,"""Take your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty ape!""",8,2 October 2012,"The original ""Planet of the Apes"" is a science fiction classic that, after more than 40 years, still stands the test of time. The story revolves around a group of astronauts who crash land on an unspecified planet hundreds of years in the future. There they find that apes have evolved into the dominant race while human beings are their oppressed intellectual inferiors.The high concept premise (courtesy of the novel's author, Pierre Boulle) gets a thorough workout from screenwriters Michael Wilson & Rod Serling. The celebrated twist ending has Serling written all over it but the script is also jam-packed with action, social commentary and some humour for good measure.I must say that the cast is pretty impressive for a science fiction film, too. The legendary Charlton Heston is the undisputed star of the film and he has the gravitas needed to represent mankind as a whole. True, some of his performance is ridiculously over the top but those are some of my favourite parts. Apart from Heston, veterans Roddy McDowall & Kim Hunter also do a good job as a pair of apes sympathetic to our hero's plight. They and Maurice Evans (among others) had the unenviable task of having to convey emotions through a layer of prosthetic make-up.Speaking of make-up, John Chambers received an honourary Academy Award for his work on this film. While obviously (and understandably) not up to today's standards, his techniques went a long way in enabling audiences to believe in a world of highly intelligent apes.Other areas of the production were also handled surprisingly well. Franklin J. Shaffner's direction is both highly energetic and consistently inventive. The cinematography of four-time Oscar winner Leon Shamroy also captured some stunning images. Perhaps best of all, though, is Jerry Goldsmith's avant-garde score, which has since been recognized as one of the greatest in all of American cinema.Ultimately, ""Planet of the Apes"" succeeds on multiple levels. On one level it's a rousing action/adventure while on another it's a socially-conscious piece of speculative fiction. Wildly ambitious, it's a wonder that it turned out as well as it did. Myself and countless others are thankful that it did, though.",Planet of the Apes
97,cricket30,"Finally pried from his ""cold, dead hands . . . """,7,20 February 2014,". . . was Charlton Heston's (Taylor's) grip on reality here in PLANET OF THE APES. He never recognizes America's most visited national park, which NO astronaut from ANY country could miss. He doesn't wonder why a 2,000-year-old beard growth is the same as 30 days. He can't put ""two and two together:"" IF a planet has Earth's breathable atmosphere, a ""sun"" the exact diameter of Earth's, and gravity equal to Earth's, you're sure as heck back on Earth; NOT on some planet you've never seen before ""300 light years away in the Orion Constellation."" Nonchalantly dismissing his assumed parallel evolution on BOTH planets from single-cell organisms to English-speaking primates as a ""coincidence"" rather than proof of his round trip is the height of absurdity. But as soon as he cocks an ape-rifle, Heston's Taylor character returns to a logical footing. Just as ""Doonesbury"" cartoonist Gary Trudeau proved in the 1980s that Ronald Reagan ran America in the late stages of Alzheimer's Disease by conflating his past movie roles with current reality, so too did Heston rule the N.R.A. in his own final stages of dementia (see Michael Moore's FAHRENHEIT 9-11). As PLANET OF THE APES illustrates, guns are too important to be left primarily in the hands of old rich actors with mental deficiencies. Therefore, please support your local chapter of B.A.N.G.S.

98,frankde-jong,"From the bible of the Apes: ""Beware the beast Man""",7,23 June 2021,"""Planet of the apes"" appeared in the same year as ""2001: A space odyssey"" (1968, Stanley Kubrick). Both science fiction films are about the hubris of the human race, but ""Planet of the apes"" is the more accessible one, and so ""Planet of the apes"" generated a series of sequels whereas ""2001: a space odyssey"" remained a unique piece of filmmaking.""Planet of the apes"" is an adaptation of a novel by Pierre Boulle, the same one who wrote the story for ""The bridge over the river Kwai"" (1957, David Lean).""Planet of the apes"" is something completely different. It is about a planet where the apes are in charge and men is just an inferior creature. The book was released in 1963 and in all probability was not only the inspiration for the film version of 1968 but also for ""The monkey fair"" (1965), an album of the popular series of comic books ""Spike & Suzy"" bij the Belgian Willy Vandersteen.""Planet of the apes"" is not only a science fiction movie, but also a political satire like ""Animal farm"" (1947, George Orwell). The apes do have much in common with the human race. The have religions, taboos, apes breaking the taboos of course, power games and last but not least racism. The apes do have a strict caste system. The gorilla's are the soldiers, the chimpanzees are the scientists and the orang utans are the politicians.Apart from the fact that the spectator has to accept for real that the apes are talking English, the satire is sometimes a little bit to prominent and explicit and can not fascinate until the end. In this respect the film really is the opposite of ""2001: a space odyssey"", which still generates new interpretations after more than 50 years.Luckily, when the satire begins to bore, the science fiction takes over. After the (very surprising) end we begin to understand the aversion of the apes against the human race. Unfortunately, as we have seen earlier in the film, they have adopted most of his bad habits already.A final word about the difference of science fiction movies of the '50s and the 60's. In the 50's the fear for communism (danger from outside) was predominant. A lot of science fiction movies were about hostile aliens that symbolized the Russians. An example is ""Invasion of the body snatchers"" (1956, Don Siegel). In the 60's fear for a nuclear destruction (danger from inside) was predominant. This led to a lot of post apocalyptical movies, of which ""Planet of the apes"" is an example. Viewed this way ""Forbidden planet"" (Fred Wilcox) was ahead of his time in 1956.",Planet of the Apes
99,Xstal,Simian Organ Grinders...,8,5 October 2020,"As fascinating today, as upon its release in the late 1960s, primarily due to the immense analysis and evaluation that it encourages relating to race, society, hierarchy, slavery, prejudice, opportunity, equality, corruption, war, stereotyping etc. etc. etc. This dystopian world feels far too close to the one we inhabit today, albeit with the threat of nuclear war replaced by the climate emergency and the recent pandemic - soon to be replaced by Artificial Intelligence. A lot of the roles portrayed are mappable generalisations we are all familiar with. The most impactful part for me was when the people were being captured, how must those people of West Africa have felt when the invaders arrived in the 16th century and captured them, removed them from their homes and land, enslaved them.

101,Cosmoeticadotcom,Great,8,25 September 2008,"It was directed by Franklin Schaffner, who went on to success with the Oscar-winning biopic Patton. It is the tale of a misanthropic astronaut, and his three comrades, sent on the first interstellar flight, somewhere towards Alpha Centauri. The tale follows Heston's character, Colonel George Taylor, and his two surviving male underlings, Dodge and Landon, after they crash land on a seemingly deserted Earth-like world. The female member of the crew, Stewart, has died due to an air leak in her hibernation capsule.While they think they are in a different solar system, and have traveled over two thousand years into the future, it not too slowly becomes apparent that they are back on Earth. The willful suspension of disbelief is needed, of course, because the chances that astronauts could not tell that they were under our sun, moon, and constellations- even a few millennia hence, is unlikely. Then there is the terrestrial flora, then the encounter with mute humans (how unlikely is that?), and then being captured by English speaking gorillas on a hunt. I mean- they speak English, and American astronauts cannot piece things together? Yet, if one can give in to that initial act, all the rest of the film- and subsequent series, unfolds with quite a bit of logic, although at times seeming at odds.Dodge ends up killed and stuffed in an ape museum while Landon is lobotomized so he cannot speak. Taylor cannot speak, initially, because he has been shot in the throat by a gorilla. He is mended by two chimpanzee scientists, Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowell), an archaeologist, who believe he is 'bright.' She calls him Bright Eyes. They are under the tutelage of Dr. Zaius, an orangutan bureaucrat who knows the secret that his world is earth, and that taking humans once ruled it.Eventually, Taylor regains his voice, after being put on by trial with Zira and Cornelius, who are charged with heresy, and one of the film's many signature moments comes when Taylor is netted and captured after escaping, and rails to the apes who catch him, 'Get your stinkin' paws off me you damn dirty ape!' Yet, by the time that line is uttered the viewer has so bought into the film's suspension of disbelief, that when we see the shock on the faces of the apes, upon hearing a human speak, it mirrors the viewers' shock. Later, at the trial comes the great sequence where the three orangutan inquisitors will hear no more, and cover their eyes, mouths, and ears, in the classic see no evil, speak no evil, and hear no evil pose.What some forget, in all the manifest political analogies the film and series put forth- such as the three ape races corresponding with the three main Classical stocks of Man: Negroid/Gorilla, Caucasoid/Chimpanzee, and Mongoloid/Orangutan, is that Planet Of The Apes was also a devastating critique of organized religion and its deliberate deceits. Zira and Cornelius, with Zira's nephew, free Taylor, and he and Nova (Linda Harrison)- the female human given to him as a mate, escape with them to The Forbidden Zone- the desert where Taylor first landed. Zaius and the gorillas follow, on horseback, and Cornelius shows proof that humans preceded apes on the planet, including a human doll that could speak. Taylor asks if an ape would make a doll that speaks. They also find dentures and an artificial heart valve. The gorillas attack and Taylor takes Zaius hostage, gets food, water, a rifle and ammo, and he and Nova are allowed to escape along the shoreline, after scorning the man with a citation from Ape scripture: 'Beware the beast man, for he is the Devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust or greed. Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land. Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours. Shun him; drive him back into his jungle lair, for he is the harbinger of death.' Zaius then blows up the cave and the secret of human history predating ape culture.One might think that Taylor should have pieced things together by now, but the film ends with him finally linking things up, when he comes across the deteriorated upper half of the Statue Of Liberty, and curses his ancestors. Whether the statue has been blown up or simply buried in sand is unclear. What is clear is that it is not only a great twist ending to the film, thought up by the film's original screenwriter, Rod Serling of The Twilight Zone fame, but an iconic political image- and the most devastating of the 1960s to come from film. Here is Heston, the embodiment of intelligent macho American goodness- far more so than the more one dimensional icon of John Wayne, on his knees and wailing, pounding the sand impotently, as all that was America is in ruins. Given that this was released not long after the Tet Offensive showed that America was losing in Vietnam, its impact was enormous.The film was one of the two great science fiction films released that year, which made sci fi a more respectable subject for serious drama. The other, of course, was Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, whose iconic imagery was on a par with this film's. Serling's original script, which more closely followed the novel's futuristic themes, was redone by Michael Wilson, who for budgetary reasons had to primitivize the ape society. The film won three Oscars- for best score, by Jerry Goldsmith, Best Costume Design, and Outstanding Achievement in Makeup- an honorary award specifically for the film's historic impact. It is the truly otherworldly and spooky score by Goldsmith that- along with Serling's original screenplay, make the film such a classic.",Planet of the Apes

103,baumer,Some films stand the test of time,10,20 August 2001,"Does contain spoilers!I remember recently having an argument at work with my boss who vehemently argued that 1968's Planet of the Apes is head and shoulders above Tim Burton's version.  I had just come back from seeing Burton's and was quite impressed.  And even though I had never seen this one, I argued the other way.  I am not sure why I did this, perhaps it was just to play Devil's Advocate, maybe it was just cause I'm an ass at times or maybe I really thought that this version couldn't be better than the new one.  After all, Burton's post apocalyptic futuristic ape world was inhabited by apes that were intelligent enough to form societies and create laws but they were too stupid to realize that the world they live in is big enough for both humans and animals.  It went to great lengths ( or so I thought) to show man's, and conversely apes ignorance when it comes to the welfare of anything that is considered lower in intellect.  In short, I felt that Burton's Planet of the Apes touched on many issues that are important to me.  I couldn't really see how a film made 30 some years ago could top that.  Boy was I wrong!I rated 2001's POTA an 8.5 based mostly on it's theories and because of the action in the film (and because I have a soft spot for Michael Clarke Duncan).  If that is true, and I do feel that way, then 1968's POTA is easily worth a ten and that is what I am giving it.  Very few films make you feel something.  Let me re-phrase that.  A good film will entertain you, an even better one can enlighten you.  But only a very few precious films can keep you entertained and fill your head with a plethora of thought provoking ideas and ""what-ifs"" at the very same time.  Planet of the Apes is one of those films.  JFK, and all of it's pseudo-theories about the assassination of the president left me feeling exhausted and afraid of the world we live in.  Films like The Matrix (you're a disease, Mr. Anderson"") and T-2 (""it's in your nature to destroy yourselves"") and Instinct (""these are the takers"") gave me similar premonitions.  You can add Planet of the Apes to that select breed of films that gave me a similar feeling.  This is a film that takes its time to tackle such weighty issues as evolution, human rights, animal rights, racism, religious ambiguity, military strong arms and many other issues.  The screenplay was skillfully adapted by Rod Serling of Twilight Zone fame from a book by Pierre Boulle. And although I have not read the book, I have read that the film is different in quite a few ways.  For instance, the book and subsequently Burton's version, has the apes very technologically advanced.  But because of technological inferiority in 1968 the film took the apes and had them living in a primitively built city/village.  They had buildings made of rock but not concrete.  The had guns but not automatic weapons.  And although Burton's version hasn't introduced them to guns, the apes are much stronger, much higher up on the evolutionary scale.  But in this POTA, there seems to be a missing link.  Certain apes have theories that apes really evolved from man and yet the humans in this world cannot speak.  They seem to understand some things, but they cannot comprehend what is being said to them all of the time, kind of like the way our animals are today.  This opens up a plethora possibilities.  Are these humans mutants, are they a cross between man and ape?  Have they been scientifically altered by some medical Nazi-like experiment and over time, generations have adapted to these experiments?  There are many weighty issues open for discussion.  Other reviewers bring up the possibility of a nuclear war and one of Taylor's observations was that there may have been a nuclear shower or meteor storm that devastated humans, just like the dinosaurs before them.  And doesn't that make Heston's speech at the beginning of Armageddon ( it happened once it'll happen again.. it's just a matter of time) all the more chilling?Contains major spoilers in the next few paragraphs.  Please, do not read if you plan on seeing the film soon for the first time!!!!  You have been warned!  2001's version of POTA was quite impressive because of technology first and the story second.  While it did think about things such as animal rights and such, it did not hold it as important as this version does.  This is a film that you could watch over and over again and still have it give you that sinking feeling in your stomach every time.  The ending alone is enough to open up discussion for months to come.  And I have a theory.  So bear with me.  If what he sees at the end of the film on the beach is really the whole thing sitting there, and not just the head ( meaning that the rest of it is buried some 200 feet in the sand, then this presents a whole slew of possibilites.  Dr Zaius has discovered the cave where he believes there is sufficient enough evidence that there were intelligent human occupants before apes.  The basis of his evidence is that on different levels of the earth, buried in the sand and clay there are artifacts to support his claim. One one level he found reading glasses and deeper still, he finds false teeth and in another level, even deeper he found a babies doll that talks. Proof that evolution granted man the ability to talk.  But when Taylor is left to ""find his destiny"" what he finds is the thing that may be buried so deep in the earth from thousands of years of stagnancy.  What if what he is seeing is really all in tact, just buried some 200 feet under the earth?  If they could dig that far down, what would they find?  Would they find dishes or the remains of houses?  Would they find subway tunnels, sewage pipes, bones of sewer rats, bones of CHUD like people?  The possibilities are endless.  This could turn the ape world upside down and it would create a division in those that are ardent followers of the ape religion and those that believe in evolution.  Doesn't this kind of sound similar to situations here in our time?End of spoilersPOTA is the one of the best Science Fiction films I have ever seen and this would easily crack my top 100 films ever made.  And that is after 2 viewings.  I want to go back and watch this film a few more times so I can really understand it.  It is a rare film that entertains and poses some very interesting and provocative questions.  And as I said earlier, there are very few films that can do something like that.  Films like American Pie or Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Godfather are great because they entertain and make you laugh or cheer.  POTA is in a class with other films like T-2 and Aliens.  These are films that also entertain but they force you to examine who we are and where we have come from and where we could possibly go.  Is it possible that man will one day become so unbearable that some divine intervention will occur so that we are not the inferior species?  A film like this makes you think and wonder?  What if......?10 out 0f 10-- This is one of the best films I have ever seen and it is one that I am going to get my kids to watch someday.  Burton's is fun and thought-provoking.  This one is simply mind blowing and intellectually stimulating.  This is a must see for any generation.",Planet of the Apes
104,hnt_dnl,Haunting and still provocative sci-fi masterpiece!,10,15 April 2011,"When I think about this day and age if the internet, youtube, etc., I realize how lucky I am to have grown up getting to see movies fresh with no distractions and the element of SURPRISE! I recall first watching this film PLANET OF THE APES (1968) as a kid on TV late one Friday or Saturday night and enjoying it a lot. Yeah, there are a LOT of movies I liked as a kid that I realize aren't so great now, but it's so refreshing to have seen a true classic as a kid, knowing absolutely nothing about it at the time (other than it looked like an interesting sci-fi flick and starred the actor who played Moses!) and later in life seeing it repeatedly and realizing how it still holds up, even more so in this age of awful film experiences! PLANET OF THE APES stars Charlton Heston in one of his most iconic roles as Taylor, an astronaut sent on a space mission in a ship travelling at the speed of light. Along with 3 other astronauts (2 other males, 1 female), their ship crash lands 3000 years in the future on a desolate planet that is run by an advanced civilization of apes. Key figures in the ape colony are scientists Dr. Zaius (a brilliant performance by Maurice Evans) and Zira (wonderfully ""humanistic"" role by Kim Hunter) and her husband Cornelius (the always entertaining Roddy McDowall). Captured by the apes, Taylor is imprisoned and meets the stunning human beauty Nova (an enchanting Linda Harrison), who along with all other humans on the planet are mute and servile to the apes.The beauty of this film is that it is there is never a dull moment! It moves at a brisk pace, has a focused story, exceptional and confident acting, thought-provoking dialogue that never sounds stale or self-important. I know that Mr. Heston has been accused in his career of ""overacting"" at times, but IMHO, this is the type of role that fit him like a kid glove! He was born to play action-oriented, leading man roles like this one and he carries the movie wonderfully as all his reactions to his surroundings are spot on. Plus, his weighty stature adds to the powerful ending! Directed by Franklin Schaffner, PLANET OF THE APES is an all time classic!",Planet of the Apes
105,hall895,Damned dirty apes!,7,12 March 2013,"George Taylor leads a group of four astronauts sent to explore the farthest reaches of outer space. Hibernation, time dilation and light speed travel combine to send them 2,000 years into the future. They crash-land on a distant planet. What they will discover will shock them. Shock us too.One astronaut, the female of the group, didn't survive the journey. The other three have to abandon ship in a hurry because they've landed in water and that ship is sinking. With only the sparest provisions they make their way ashore. What they find is a barren, seemingly uninhabited, desert-like world. But they eventually do find some humans. But not humans like we know them. These humans are primitive creatures. Mute, dressed in rags, seemingly devoid of any intelligence. And then the apes arrive. Gorillas attack the humans, killing some and capturing others. Taylor is shot in the throat and dragged away to the ape habitat. Here he finds that in this world it is the apes who have evolved. They walk, they talk. They have their own society. Gorilla hunters, chimpanzee scientists, orangutan leaders. In this world Taylor is the animal.His throat wound rendering him unable to speak Taylor is unable to convince the apes he is intelligent, evolved, unlike all the other primitive humans they hunt for sport. But a chimpanzee psychologist, Zira, sees a spark of intelligence in him. She and her fiancé, Cornelius, take great interest in Taylor, who is unlike any human they have ever seen. Unfortunately Dr. Zaius, the orangutan who oversees Cornelius and Zira's work, has no use for an intelligent human. He wants Taylor disposed of before he causes any trouble. It becomes pretty clear that Zaius knows more about Taylor, and humans, than he's letting on. What is he hiding? The answers will rock Taylor. And the audience.Now this might all sound somewhat silly, like a bad B-movie. That is not the case at all. This is a serious movie, with a serious message. And it's very well done. Charlton Heston, playing Taylor, is the big star and while he may be a little melodramatic and over-the-top at times it is a fine performance. But for the movie to really work it was the performers portraying the apes who really had to do a great job. They had to convince you that these creatures were intelligent and they had to infuse each individual ape with its own unique personality and motivations. The key roles of Zira, Cornelius and Zaius are performed by Kim Hunter, Roddy McDowall and Maurice Evans respectively and they brilliantly bring these apes to life. No easy task showing personality through ape masks but these actors pulled it off, helped no doubt by the fact the ape costumes look so convincing. Truly excellent makeup and prosthetic work was done here. To believe in the movie you had to believe in the apes. You do and that allows the movie's very smart story to truly shine. It's a bit of a slow build but from the moment Taylor utters his famous ""stinking paws"" line of dialogue the movie picks up steam as it hurtles toward its brilliant, stunning conclusion. A very well thought-out, and very well executed, sci-fi success.",Planet of the Apes
106,sharky_55,"Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.",9,20 July 2016,"The opening of The Planet of the Apes is strongly reminiscent of another sci-fi masterpiece from the same year, 2001: A Space Odyssey. The interiors of the human spacecraft are sleek by design and quiet; the stars outside drift by slowly before hyperspace is entered. Kubrick also made space travel slow, almost agonisingly so, as the spacecraft danced in rhythm to his score. And then in the same vein, as the vehicle nears impact, the camera dives into the earth, speeding over hills and lakes and spinning around chaotically. Goldsmith's soundtrack evokes a sense of alienation within the familiar surroundings; frantic harp glissandos as their technology plummets from the skies like a fallen angel, and sharp, high-pitched hisses that double as both the breaching of the craft's doors and the discovery of the death of one of the Astronauts. Nature is reclaiming what it is owed.The remaining three are hurtled back through the evolutionary timeline, sporting scraggly beards and forced to row along the river like savages. The early beginnings of the film are a masterclass in establishing atmosphere and setting. Water and dirt are made alien in the spectacular photography, wide shots presenting the desolate plains and undisturbed lake like some sort of twisted western. They wander through countless jagged mountain ranges; perhaps one of them was once Rushmore, bearing the faces of the presidents long vanished. And when they discover a waterfall and its oasis, they shriek happily and strip and dive in like...well, animals.The symbolic nature of the film emerges in two fronts. The crude caste system that discriminates based on species and colour attacked racism in a tumultuous social arena just two years shy of the Civil Rights Act, but in doing so somewhat re-emphasises the battle as merely skin-deep. The source of this system is never fully explained beyond a vague reference to their gospels and as a result prevents the message from being truly explored. The second front manifests as a condemnation on the what originally was the church's opposition to Darwinism. The elders are dismissive of such notions that man could ever write or show signs of intelligence even with the evidence right in front of their eyes. The screenplay employs a clever if not obvious reversal; Taylor shrieks at being handled by ""dirty apes"", and then later is afforded the same sub-human treatment. The church won't have it, of course; they remain willfully ignorant and even deliberately act to bury the truth. While its social messages are perhaps misguided and a tad heavy handed, Planet of the Apes emerged as a sci-fi classic because of the enduring appeal of its images. The framing and compositions elicit a fear and imagination far beyond what any conventional thriller could present; a pale hand snatching a pile of clothes, ominous, X-shaped 'scarecrows' perched high on the hills, and of course the brilliant triumph of the final twist ending. Most know it by now, but it does not lose its impact. Just a brief hint of an aged, derelict structure ravaged by time, and then the heart-stopping final zoom out, and merely the waves lapping on quietly, getting on with its job. No doubt time would have stepped in had the humans not finished themselves off.",Planet of the Apes

108,ajs-10,A classic piece of Sci-Fi!,8,18 May 2011,"I have seen this film a several times before but this is the first time I've attempted a review. Made at the time when NASA was getting closer to putting a man on the moon, writers were beginning to explore the possibilities this achievement might open up. French novelist Pierre Boulle took it to its extreme with his novel of the same title on which this film is based. For those that are maybe too young, or have been living under a rock for the last forty or so years, here's a brief summary.Colonel George Taylor and his surviving crew, Landon and Dodge, crash land on a planet they think is far from Earth in the Orion constellation. It looks very barren but the air is breathable and there is water. They set off to find if there is any life. Eventually they find plants and then primitive mute human like creatures. These humans are foraging for food when they are attacked by apes! No ordinary apes though, these can speak, ride horses and use weapons. Dodge is killed and Taylor is injured in the throat before he is captured. He is taken to the Ministry of Science where he is put under the care of Dr. Zira who treats his injuries. She is intrigued by his attempts to talk. Her friend, Cornelius, is more cautious and her boss, the Minister of Science, Dr. Zaius, wants him put down. Still unable to talk, Taylor eventually escapes but is re-captured after an exciting chase through the town. It is here he is heard to say the memorable line, ""Get your filthy ape hands off of me!"". What can this mean for the apes? A human that can talk! There are plenty of witnesses who believe man to be inferior to them and is to be treated like any dumb animal. All this and much more is revealed but, of course, I'm not going to tell you here.Somebody really thought about the world the Apes inhabit, there is a clear structure to their society. Orang-utans are the administrators, chimps are the scientists and gorillas are the military. It's not clear who does all the menial jobs, but there is a structure there. The cinematography is quite superb; it would have looked great on the big screen (I've only ever seen it on TV). Of course the make up effects are also groundbreaking and quite brilliant for the time it was made. The music is quite unusual, but still in keeping with the visuals.I thought Charlton Heston did a great job as Colonel George Taylor, he played it with the arrogance and swagger the part needed. Kim Hunter was also really good as Dr. Zira, she was really great despite the limitations of the costume and the make-up. Of course, Roddy McDowall is best known for his part as Cornelius, and various parts in the other 'Planet of the Apes' films and finally as Galen in the much loved '70's TV series of the same name. Also worthy of note are Maurice Evans as Dr. Zaius, James Whitmore as the President of the Assembly and Linda Harrison as Nova (although she didn't have to say much).This is the best of the 'Planet of the Apes' films, even the 2001 reboot starring Mark Wahlberg. It gained a huge following and started a very lucrative franchise for the studio. It is really well made although I thought it took quite a long time before we actually saw an ape. It also struck me that for a species of vegetarians they wear an awful lot of leather just an observation. So, over all, a really well made and iconic film with some great ideas that really took hold of the public imagination. I really enjoy it every time I see it Highly recommended.My Score: 8.4/10",Planet of the Apes

George Taylor (Charlton Heston) is a space pilot floating through space at the speed of light which alters time and moves them forward centuries. When the spaceship crash lands, the crew discovers one of their members has aged to death and their ship is sinking. The three remaining crew members abandon ship and paddle towards land. The environment is strange and desolate and director Franklin J. Schaffner does a great job creating an eerie aura to the foreign planet. Landon (Robert Gunner) is worried about their new life and wants to know where exactly they are while George insists they are far away and will survive by any means necessary. Dodge (Jeff Burton) seeks life on this new planet as a means of survival for as long as they have left.The crew treks across the barren landscape and find strange scarecrows along with water. Humans native to the planet shred their clothes but are unable to communicate. A strange sound sends them all fleeing and apes on horseback with guns chase them down. Dodge is shot and killed during the skirmish. George notices Nova (Linda Harrison) but is also shot in the throat. The scientist ape Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) gives George a blood transfusion and notices something different about him. His throat prevents from speaking so Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) does not believe they are intelligent. George is attacked by other humans and tries to write in the dirt but Dr. Zaius cover it up.

110,FilmOtaku,"Cheesy, but clever sci-fi film",7,31 May 2004,"-Possible Spoilers-The unfortunate thing about films with great endings, particularly films that have been around for awhile, is that some great endings become ingrained in pop culture, and therefore hinder the viewing of said film for the first time. 'Planet of the Apes' is one of those films, and while watching it for the first time, I couldn't help but feel I was just plowing through an hour and a half of film to get to that one great shot (the 'money shot' if you will) on the beach. In between the first frame and the last, however, there are some good (albeit cheesy) scenes, and actually a pretty decent and innovative script, not to mention a bizarre score that at times sounds like a cross between progressive jazz and a two year old experimenting with a Casio keyboard, 'Planet of the Apes' suffers from some pretty awful paper mache sets that look like they could have been borrowed from the set of The Flintstones (let's not apply logic to that statement, shall we?), mod 1960's outfits, and too many buffalo shots of Charlton Heston, but in all was a fun film made even more classic by it's treatment during the subsequent nearly four decades, and the evolution of Mr. Chuck Heston himself. How can one refrain from at least smiling when we hear him spit out the words 'Damn dirty ape' (seemingly forty times) or laugh when Chuck, president of the NRA, stands bare-chested, greased up and cocks his gun with the perpetual grimace that seems to always be on his face. On its own merits, 'Planet of the Apes' is a good sci-fi flick, and fairly groundbreaking in terms of its premise, but it has only improved with age because of the iconic status it has been awarded and its firm place in our pop culture. I know that I for one certainly was internally singing the songs from The Simpsons' take on the film, a stage musical which, if you didn't already know the ending to the film, gives us the astronaut brilliantly portrayed by the great Troy McClure) singing, 'Oh my god, I was wrong, it was earth all along  you've finally made a monkey out of me.' It takes a film with a certain degree of mettle to inspire this kind of idolatry and 'Planet of the Apes' is a classic film that has it in spades. --Shelly",Planet of the Apes

112,rebeljenn,a classic,8,5 March 2006,"'Planet of the Apes' is about astronauts who find themselves on a planet ruled by apes who act like humans (have their own society) and who have human slaves. This science fiction film has an original plot with a twist at the end and encourages some thinking and uses science (evolution) to explain itself as well as bringing up some problems and mirrors in their society when compared to ours. At times, the film is a little bit slow and unengaging, but it makes up for it by the end. The set design and acting is sometimes amusing in places, but this does not distract from the story. This is a must-see film, especially if you enjoy science fiction films. Do not give this one a miss, and do not bother with the 2001 'remake' of the film and think you've seen it.

Probably the best, most effective portrayal of the dangers of religion. Charlton Heston is wonderful in his role, and a great action hero.

Even the landmark film ""2001"" suffers a bit from it.This film grabs you from the first minute and doesn't let go.There's a creepy tone to the films first half-hour, only bolstered by some fantastic sound editing and music.This is a non-stop adventure. Uber-fast-paced. At the end, we wish the film would just keep going.The make-up work is fantastic, and it's not just the apes. Blood that actually looks like blood(novel idea)etc.The acting is strong across the board, and it's amazing how expressive the ape faces can be.The concept isn't rocket science(pun intended), but it's still intriguing. One of the best moments of the film is when Heston falls to his knees at the end, ""you finally did it!"".The series would never be as good again, but I can't remember a more anticipated sequel. This original has teeth, and should go down as one of the top 6 or 7 sci-fi films ever made.This film shouldn't be this good.

So when I picked up this DVD I had no idea what to expect. I was blown away. This film was brilliant in all aspects. First and foremost the story is set up so that the the suspense doesn't let up, at all, for the entire film. Thankfully, since no one had spoiled it for me, the ending retained all its intended shock value. And throughout the film there is a sense of discovery and adventure that is rarely ever seen, at least to such a degree. Along the way, important themes are explored such as ethics and religious and scientific explanations for the nature of all creation. What can be said about Charlton Heston that hasn't already been said? This film belongs with The Ten Commandments and Ben Hur as the best in his pantheon. It's sad that certain liberals attack him for his vocal participation in the NRA. The supporting cast is superb as well, though they are of course unrecognizable under their makeup. Linda Harrison who plays the love interest is also very easy on the eyes. The sets, special effects, costumes and makeup (which won an honorary Oscar) are all top notch and hold up perfectly today. I should also mention the beauty of the location photography. The natural landscapes are spectacular. This film is perfect in all aspects.

To me this is a very serious drama where many important issues of our origin are discussed. Let's try to remember Inquisition imposed by Catholic church during the Medieval era, and you will see that Apes in their planet did the same with the humans and with their scientists. Cornelius was a kind of Galileo Galilei, anything he supposed or found was rejected by the council. Funny to see how the roles are changed here, i.e. the Apes judging the humans and denying the theory of evolution, refusing that the planet is round, not letting the people to visit the forbidden area.

The irony becomes a double one when we realise that Taylor is someone who dislikes his fellow man, and is forced to become a defender of the species. It's a neat trick and Heston's subtle and dignified acting emphasises the point perfectly.Planet Of The Apes is a movie that makes an interesting contrast to so many of today's empty CGI-bloated ""Sci-fi"" epics. Firstly it's actually an intelligent movie about where humanity is heading if we don't curb our self-destructive tendencies, secondly it's beautifully shot and expertly directed, the first 30 minutes or so convincingly steering the viewer away from the famous twist-ending.Thirdly the actors deserve enormous praise for bringing off a near-impossible challenge - making us forget they're humans in ape make-up. Kim Hunter is terrific as Zira, as is McDowell as her finance. Maurice Evans' Dr. Zaius is a splendid adversary for Heston.The basic plot concerns a small group of astronauts from our time (that is the late 60s) stranded on an alien planet thousands of years in the future, although thanks to Relativity they have aged only 18 months since blasting off from Earth. They discover here that Apes are the most evolved species, and that humans are mute animals, unthinking and unreasoning. Taylor (Heston) faces a battle for his own survival while trying to make sense of his predicament. His fellow astronauts wind up stuffed in an ape museum and lobotomised.Forget Tim Burton's awful ""reimagining"" (the Oxford Dictionary should define that word as making a great film into a crap one) and savour this fantastic movie. It may not be as arty as 2001 but it's just as brilliant for my money.",Planet of the Apes
118,Hayden-86055,Smart science fiction film that missed out on Oscars,9,6 December 2020,"Led by the great Charlton Heston, Planet of the Apes is one of the most exciting and well aged films of the 60s. Filmed at the Grand Canyon and having some of the most creative film sets and plots of all time. Additionally, the costumes are also great.Roddy McDowall, Charlton Heston and Kim Hunter all play their roles impeccably and seamlessly slip from scene to scene. Heston especially steals the show in every scene he's in, even if he's not talking, actions speak louder than words.The plot has some of the most thought-provoking and interesting aspects to it I've seen in awhile and really gets you thinking, the humans who are unable to talk are far superior to the humans in the 2001 Planet of the Apes who can not only talk but have their own resistance and weapons, the people are more refinement of beasts and real apes in this one.9/10: A definite must watch for sci-fi fans",Planet of the Apes
119,raymond-15,Brilliant art direction outshines acting performances,7,4 January 2001,"The human mind can scarcely imagine a spaceship travelling at the speed of light, but in the ""Planet of the Apes"" it is set on ""Automatic"" and ""Full speed ahead"".  What is more incredible is that they make a soft landing in a lake on a distant planet and (Would you believe it?) the atmosphere is just right for human life.  The imaginative script introduces us to what seems a deserted planet at first, but soon we see figures scrurrying around the rocky landscape.  The figures turn out to be apes and none too friendly. our three adventurers soon finding themselves imprisoned in sturdy cages.  It's a very original approach that men and apes change places, the apes being the masters of the situation and the men living the lives of caged animals. It's interesting too that the apes have developed a judiciary system similar to the one we know.  Our heroes have little chance in court and plan to make their escape from the cages.  The story concerns mainly the escape and subsequent chase.  I would like to be able to say how very exciting all this action is, but regrettably it fails to move me due mainly I think to the poor acting.  The make-up, movement and general presentation is 100% effective, with Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter who show some sympathy towards the humans giving believable performances.  This is not Charlton Heston's best film.  Perhaps the biblical films suit his style of acting better.",Planet of the Apes
120,silverscreen888,Sci-Fi Allegory For All Time; One Man Against a World of Apes,9,14 July 2005,"This is a great movie, with all the elements for classic success. The problem I see with it as a writer is that the bravura production has obscured the script's values. People love this movie, for all the wrong reasons. In outline, it is simply another of those starship is sent out by hopeful, mentally-under-civilized humans narrative lines. Something goes wrong during its suspended animation voyage; of the four astronauts aboard, one, a woman, dies; the other three find themselves unable to control descent and having to land in a large lake. Their ship inks; they paddle their escape raft to shore with what gear they can save. Then they must cross a forbidding territory, in their space suits, without knowing what planet they are on, what its races and animal life are, and even where they ought to go. They find ape-skins nailed to X-shaped structures; and without knowing they are scare-humans, they continue on and find a verdant zone with a waterfall, fresh-flowing water and green growths. Forgetting their regrets, for the Earth of their time--only one, the leader Taylor has none since he never liked his time not trusted its leaders not to blow up the planet--they go swimming and hurry back to shore too late to find their clothes; someone or something has stolen them. Continuing on, they find humans, strangely silent, furtively stealing food; they are primitive, rather dirty and obviously frightened specimens. The viewer and the three astronauts soon hat they are watching for; gorilla's dressed in army uniforms riding horses come along, blow strange signal horns and use great nets to capture the food thieves, the astronauts along with them. Taylor tries to fight back but a whip is wrapped around his throat, depriving him of speech and he blacks out. He wakes up in a pen with many others; There he notes Cornelius, a young chimpanzee scientist and his fiancée, Zira, who are kinder to him; but they too regard the humans as an inferior species, under the watchful and hostile eye of their boss Dr. Zaius. Only Zira believes humans are not animals. Taylor tries to write her a message--she calls him ""Bright Eyes""; but Dr. Zaius erases it. She has him brought indoors to a cell and introduces a pretty human girl for company. Finally, Taylor, frustrated and still unable to speak, escapes and leads the camera in a chase through the ape city, until he is finally caught and netted again, and cries, ""Take your filthy paws off me--you damned dirty ape!"" He is taken to Dr. Zaius. And he learns the history of the world. Weapons destroyed it, apparently atomic weapons, since there is a ""Forbidden Zone"". Gorillas are soldiers, chimpanzees are scientists and orangutans are the leaders. Taylor finds out one of his men is dead, the other had his brain removed by Dr. Zaius to hide his humanity--he is now an exhibit in the Museum. Once more, Taylor, who is interrogated by a group of leaders and not believed, has to escape. He takes Zaius with him and Cornelius and Zira have to go because they helped him avoid death. They travel into the ""Forbidden Zone"", to a cave where they seek evidence that in the past, man could talk and had a civilization; that they were those who built and destroyed the world's centers, and the apes only came afterward. Learning the truth, Taylor takes Nova, the girl, on horseback with him. They flee the apes and journey along the edge of the ocean. And there he makes a terrible discovery. ""You finally did it--damn you!"" he screams, as the camera pans back to reveal the Stature of liberty all-but-buried in the sand of a desolate shore; he and his crew mates have come back to the planet of the apes--and find it is Earth. Franklin Schaeffner directed this remarkable sci-fi work.The script from a thin Pierre Boulle novel was written by Michael Wilson and Serling. The cinematography by Leon Shamroy, the ape makeup designed by John Chambers and the costumes by Morton Haack are very-well realized; the art direction by William Creber and Jack Martin Smith with set decorations by Norman Rocket and Walter M. Scott are classically good. Jerry Goldsmith supplied the sensationally eerie music. In the surprisingly small cast are Charlton Heston quite good the acerbic Taylor, Kim Hunter as Zira, Roddy MacDowall as Cornelius, Maurice Evans toweringly fine as Dr. Zaius, and such luminaries as James Whitmore, Woodrow Parfrey, Wright King and James Daly as leaders of the apes. Sci-fi movie makers have seldom been given so much to work with. But all people remember about the film are the ending, the apes and the attempt by Taylor to talk without success for a long while. This is however not just another pseudo-religious anti-individualist ""rocket takes off and crashes back to Earth movie""; It has a luminously-intelligent way of dealing with what ought to be human and what is not. Its writers give the negative human qualities they think are less-than-human to the apes; and introduced a rational man among them--Taylor...And this makes all the difference. The film was given three sequels, and it became a one-season brilliant television show. But as an allegory for the position of the man who thinks for himself in an empire of postmodernist public-dictator and unselfish-obedient minds operating by appearances and prejudices, it has seldom been equaled, never yet surpassed.",Planet of the Apes
121,strike-1995,One line,8,31 October 2018,"The allegory is about as subtle as a sledgehammer, but he film itself is an undoubted masterpiece. It's sense of ambition and scope should have set a precedent for all of science fiction, no matter the limitations.",Planet of the Apes
122,gigan-92,"""What will he find out there, doctor?""",10,20 March 2012,"Perhaps the greatest sci-fi film? Undoubtedly one of the best sci-fi films of all time, that's for sure. Never since this one, despite its original four sequels, Tim Burton re-make and 2011 re-boot, has the series been this hard hitting. Don't get me wrong; I enjoy all of the Ape films, finding something worthwhile in each one of them (while not denying the absurdity factor that would dampen the series in the 70s), but nothing compares to this one. Let me start by honoring the actors who helped cement the characters in our minds for all time. Charlton Heston as Taylor, wow, how iconic. The character represents the inner nihilism we all feel inside when we stare at the decadence of our society; the urge to feel that there is something better out there, just maybe. Of course this leads to the great irony of the story, all leading up to that unforgettable ending. Roddy McDowall, who played Cornelius (and would go on to play his son Cesar), is just excellent. I'm so glad he returned in the sequels. Who can forget Kim Hunter as Zira? Feisty, strong, intelligent, despite the elaborate prosthetics the character is definitely meant to symbolize the ideal woman in a sense. And Maurice Evans is so great as Dr. Zaius, one of the best villain sin cinema. This is due to the fact that he's indeed a villain, but when you think about it, a necessary villain. And what the hell, Linda Harrison will forever be remembered as Nova.John Chambers make-up effects are quite extraordinary, holding up to this day. The quality of the makeup would deteriorate until finally by 73's ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"" most were merely mask. In its prime however, this process was so tedious the golden era actor Edward G. Robinson dropped out of the project early on stating that he was ""too old"" for the lengthy procedure.And the themes intertwined in the film make this quite enjoyable to watch again and again. Every single one of them is relevant to this day, making it timeless. Just a few would be the fragile relationship between religion and science, the treatment of creatures we do not perceive as sentient, and its best; the self destructive nature of mankind. And despite all its seriousness there's still quite a bit of fun to be had with it, leading to so many iconic lines. There are too many too count in this film, and I'm sure you've heard them before without even knowing it. Last but certainly not least, Jerry Goldsmith's score for the film remains one of the best he's ever done. There are many strange cues, of course accompanying the strange and often daunting images displayed. I'm sure everyone remembers the first time you see those ominous scarecrows. The beauty of the film I always admire is how it builds up quite nicely to the reveal without rushing it. Today's films are so focused on getting to the action they sacrifice atmosphere and characterization. This film to me has set a bar that very few have come close to, delivering both intellect, and suspense as well as awesome visuals.",Planet of the Apes

I also have started to use lesser plastic and stuff all the things that I purchase into a huge bag. I may not even be so good at contributing to the global warming reduction but at least I'm trying to aid the innumerable organizations that have been formed to spread awareness about global warming. But alas, I am not being helped much by my family who tend to use a bit more than required.I think that I'll have to make them watch this movie. This is one of the best examples that showcases what would happen due to the evil deeds by humans. Humans would destroy their own civilization is the world continues to be like this. Planet of the Apes is one of the most intelligent movies that I have ever seen. ""Bravo!' to it, especially to the climax which is iconic and mesmerizing and shocking!The acting is flawless especially by the lead actor who is brutally tortured by the apes. The apes too look real, okay, not that real now but for a movie made in 1960, they surely are charming. The best thing that I felt abut the movie was that the whole planet of theirs was normal and I didn't feel that the directors want to over exaggerate just because they were apes. Therefore, a viewer would watch somewhat a similar kind of lifestyle followed by the apes just like the humans. This is a must watch, especially for the ones who are ignorant about global warming. 8 out of 10 and Kudos for this fantastic movie.",Planet of the Apes
124,Bogmeister,"You Cut Up his Brain, you Bloody Baboon!",9,28 May 2006,"So yells the American male hero at his nemesis. But it wasn't a baboon that did the cutting; no, it was probably a chimp, under orders of an orangutan. Let's get things straight: baboons were in an initial draft, but they're not apes (also, the make-up would've been too expensive). What make-up there is was very impressive for the time (they didn't really improve upon it in the 2001 remake). It says something that the audience buys into the whole social structure of Orangutans, Chimps and Gorillas ruling a society without batting an eye as the film progresses. Of course, all 3 of these classes just stand in for ourselves - our politicians, our scientists and the police/military. This is one of the best science fiction films of all time. Viewers can enjoy its strong entertainment value (the action, the adventure) and also the political/social satire. Many people forget or are unaware that the film is based on a heavy satirical novel by French author Pierre Boulle. The film manages to retain some of those satirical elements, especially in the central trial sequence.The movie begins as an interesting but typical sf adventure, with 3 astronauts making a rough landing on a planet supposedly hundreds of light years from Earth. Just as the trio's leader and most arrogant member (Heston, well cast here) begins to make plans for running the planet of backward human-like natives, the tables are instantly turned and his 2 companions are eliminated in short order. As Heston's character falls victim to the overlords, the apes - humiliated and despised - viewers have the luxury of seeing his struggle as straightforward action and/or a commentary on the close-minded attitudes of a society's leadership. Heston, who represents usually the high-ranking powerful white male, finds himself on the lowest rung of the community, as the rulers close their eyes, ears, and mouths (literally at one point during his so-called trial) to the possibility of any intelligence existing outside their own limited domain (Ape City). There's much reference to 'The Sacred Scrolls,' the apes' old religious/historical document, which indeed turns out to not be worth the parchment it's written on. Despite the logic Heston and his chimp friends (McDowall & Hunter - both excellent in the make-up) present, the ruling echelon (Evans as an orangutan policymaker - superb) prevails - the status quo must be kept, for the sake of 'simian survival.' To maintain it, such practices as lobotomizing a potential threat are approved.Heavy and deep concepts, yes? Not really, because they're nothing new to the landscape of our current global civilization. We just have a chance to see all these prevailing wisdoms and conceits attacked within a science fiction story. Of course, Heston will not be a victim for too long; even when still enslaved, he disregards the hierarchy - baboons or orangutans, it's all the same to him as he bellows his outrage - he'll have his gun in hand soon enough and there'll be some payback. You can keep an arrogant man down only for so long. But he'll always be very lonely; stuck on a planet far away (so he thinks), he also knows it's about 2000 years in the future. He'll never go home again. Then, at the very end, the story piles another shock on him; it's enough to drive even him to his knees, still one of the most memorable images in filmdom (you may wonder why he wasn't puzzled over the familiar language the apes were using, but remember, we are viewing a satire to some extent).The original Planet of the Apes movie was almost as influential in its time as the Star Trek and Star Wars sagas. The film spawned 4 film sequels (beginning with ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes""), unheard of in that time, as well as a cartoon, a TV Series, and loads of merchandise. Marvel Comics published a magazine-format comic book for awhile - all of this petered out in the 2nd half of the seventies, but, for that 1st half of the decade, apes ruled!",Planet of the Apes

There is a lot of philosophy embedded in the movie, a lot of issues discussed and presented in a digestible non-confronting way. Although there is a lot of action, thrill and mystery, and the movie is very entertaining, the dialogs and atmosphere of the film are permeated by a subtle restlessness that unsettles the viewer from the beginning to the very end.The actors are all terrific in their respective roles. Charlton Heston is good and believable in his role. However, the actors playing the main Apes (Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter and Maurice Evans) really steal the show, not because of their masks and dresses, but because the viewer forgets about them and sees them as real characters.The movie is visually impacting, still today, despite the lack of computerized special effects. The make-up and dresses are unbelievable. I mean, the end of this movie offers us one of the most iconic stunning shocking ends and images in the cinema history.The movie was filmed in 1868, therefore, some of the issues implicitly discussed in the film are out of date, but this does not rest value to a terrific entertaining film.An unforgettable classic.",Planet of the Apes

They were selling a black and white poster of the statue the Lawgiver. First marketing ploy of a movie. Bought the poster. Somehow lost the poster but I never lost the memories of my First viewing of the Planet Of The Apes. Done on a grand scale and filmed in the American southwest Three Astronauts crash land on a lake and what appears to be a barren terrain with mountains, mesa's, plateaus.The leader of the three is a bearded Charlton Heston which congers up memories of Ben Hur and Moses in his iconic films of Hollywood past. Heston plays a disgruntled product of a man from the 20th century.Yet is very philosophical about Man's chances of surviving as his space craft pasted through 2000 years of time wondering by now if there's someone or something better in the universe. Meanwhile Heston and the other two astronauts walk through deserts and hills till they find Ape hides but are swayed to the sounds of fresh water and falls. Indigenous humans steal their clothes and rations. These humans are animal like and mute. Taylor figures he'll be running this planet in no time but then the sound of poachers scares the mass of untamed human into a frenzy as they dodge what appears to be gorillas on Horseback with shot guns. Taylor and his two spacemen run through a cornfield with no where to hide as the three look in horror to this upside down world. Taylor gets shot in the neck and is captured and moved to a Animal hospital for surgery. Dr. Zira a chimpanzee Veterinarian played by Kim Hunter is taking a liking to the human in the strange tattered clothes as she refers to him as Bright Eyes. Taylor with a very sore throat communicates through hand gestures which Zira finds extraordinary to the disapproval of Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans)Her boss and Minister of Science who believes in keeping technology under raps leaving innovation at a stand still.Doctor Zaius tears up a toy paper airplane made by Taylor as our frustrated Astronaut tries to explain how he reached this planet by flying and not by falling from the sky as Cornelius and Zira believe. Zira has a husband Cornelius who is a chimp as well played by the versatile actor Roddy McDowall and is a Archaeologist. He is skeptical of Taylor's so-called intelligence as they ask him questions and Taylor responds on paper. Dr. Zaius feels that Bright eyes (Taylor) is a pestilence and there could be other humans from a distant tribe with intelligence as well. Taylor escapes as he is running through Ape City and is eventually caught in a net as Zira confronts Taylor as to why he ran away. The Gorilla grabs Taylor as Taylor responds in front of the stunned crowd of Simians. ""Get your Stinkin paws off me you damn dirty ape!"" A tribunal commences as to what to do with this missing link Taylor as he's speech returns. Shades of Nuremberg Nazi judges as three Orangutans seal Taylor's fate unjustly played by James Whitmore, James Daly and Woodrow Parfrey three all star actors which this movie has no shortages of seasoned veterans in full ape costume yet you take this acting seriously. The outcome of the tribunal doesn't come out in Taylor's favor by any means as they just treat him as a freak of nature. Taylor is rendered to be destroyed. Dr.Zaius has a private meeting with Taylor to come clean and tell him the truth about where this tribe is? Lucius,(Lou Wagner) Zira's Nephew helps Taylor escape a second time with Nova, (Linda Harrison) an undomesticated human to the forbidden zone.

Most of the messages come from the ""hippie mentality"", a closed era sectarian movement of the time, complete with the same bland, homogeneity and conformist attitude found in the corrupt, feeble minded Nixon-era regime. Their ""roam free, roam naked"" simplistic take on politics caused most of the narcissistic yuppie infestation of the 1980's that followed the collapse of societal norms in the 70's. In the film they were portrayed as the wild people.Heston, although conservative and passé at the time, not to mention dull, was to play the anti-hero, a hapless yoke who falls into a time zone and comes out nude in the end while cursing monkey paws. He gets incarcerated and eventually rides bareback with a half-nude waif who mumbles and yet is articulate enough to wear clothing.

131,lagudafuad,A Sci-Fi classic,8,15 February 2013,"Here is a Sci-Fi classic that all should get to see, especially if you are a Sci-Fi fan. Planet of the Apes is one that I think can stand the test of time as an ongoing classic. The great thing about the movie is not the graphics or the costumes which were great but could be better, the great thing about the movie is the story, and the depth of the story goes deep to the very end.The height of this great movie is the interaction; the dialogue between the characters is more captivating than the screenplay itself. The movie is based on a 1963 science fiction novel named La Planète des singes meaning Planet of the Apes or Monkey Planet in English, the novel is written Pierre Boulle. The novel's (and movie's) story is built on a strong foundation similar to that of the Biblical creation of man, the tweaks to fit the creation of man to that of apes is spectacular and one that you have to see for yourself.The plot is about three astronauts who crash landed on a planet where apes run the whole planet and humans are uncivilized and speechless. The apes were in charge and spoke while the humans were treated like animals.Taylor (Charlton Heston) and two other astronauts come out of deep hibernation to find themselves on the strange planet. Taylor sustained a throat injury that made him unable to speak, making the apes think that he is just as uncivilized as the rest humans, but when his throat healed he spoke and all hell broke loose on the ape planet.Seen as one of the best movies of our time, Planet of the Apes was a huge commercial success and it had a higher critical acclaim than any of the other four in its series. The franchise was revisited in 2001 by Tim Burton the name of the movie was also the same and the movie was a financial success, but 20th Century fox didn't continue with it but did a reboot of the franchise in 2011 named Rise of the Planet of the Apes which won an Oscar for best visual effect, a second part of the movie will be released in 2014.This movie is excellent and it is great, one that you will not mind seeing, the movie is so captivating that from the get go you will be attracted to see how it will end, and the twist ending is one that has remained in cinematic history as one of the best endings there is, and I agree.www.lagsreviews.com",Planet of the Apes

Oh well, two hours of the shoe being on the other monkey foot still is both scary and awakening, as is watching the apes bewilderment and wonder... It's a classic for a reason.",Planet of the Apes

Serious sci-fi movies very often speak to its viewers, commenting on the world and society. The setting is very different and the ending is just fantastic. An amazing movie with a lot of facets. Arguably, while the effects and makeup seem a bit stiff and 1960-ish (what else?) nowadays, the performances, the story and the compelling scope of this film makes one forget in instantly.",Planet of the Apes
137,PudgyPandaMan,"Reverse Evolution and ""I am not the missing link!""",7,30 July 2008,"This was a groundbreaking movie in its day. I have 3 impressions of it. The first is from when I first saw it as a child in the 60's. It terrified me - I had nightmares for weeks. Then I saw it again as a teenager in the mid to late 70's and I thought it was extremely ""cheesy"".I have since recently seen it again as an adult. It is amazing the different view the movie has for me now. It is quite a well made movie. But the philosophies and ideologies are little disturbing. The question is if it's meant to be taken seriously, or if they are just making lighthearted fun of the human race.One theme presented is reverse evolution - the idea that apes evolved from man, to which Heston famously replies ""I am NOT the missing link!"". There is also the portrayal of the apes of faith being zealot idiots, afraid to even consider ideas that don't fit their mold or ""ancient scrolls"".I think the acting is some of the best I have ever seen in a sci-fi. The actors in ape make-up (McDowall and Hunter)did a great job with their facial expressions - which must have been very difficult in their masks.The cinematography did a great job in depicting a bleak and harsh world. The use of odd angles and hand-held cameras added to the effect of this harsh world.I do think it is a scathing look at the worst traits of mankind - racism, prejudice, religious hypocrisy. While still a classic movie, I think it is a product of the social commentary prevalent in the 60's.",Planet of the Apes

A MAAADHOOOUSE!,10,25 August 2007,"You would think that a movie that was followed by four linear sequels, a live-action TV spin-off, and umpteen cartoons (plus a remake by Tim Burton) would come across, after almost forty years, as somewhat cheapened or dated. Well, I was nowhere near alive in 1968 to see this when it was released, but from what I understand, it was really quite something then, much like it is now.Starring Charlton Heston-- everybody's favorite gunslinger-- Franklin J. Schaffner's ""Planet of the Apes"" is one of the definitive science fiction events, and a cinematic marvel even to this day. With astonishing make-up work by John Chambers and hypnotic cinematography by Leon Shamroy, this fantastic exercise in monkey business is the story of an astronaut (Heston) who lands on an unknown planet in a distant future-- a planet controlled by advanced apes. He very soon gets the lay of the land, seeing the evil inherent in the ape leaders-- like Dr. Zaius (a gloriously wicked Maurice Evans)-- while throwing himself upon the mercy of the few apes who are humanitarians. Those humanitarians include Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Zira (Kim Hunter). Their performances (even through monstrously heavy make-up) are astoundingly good, and it makes one wish they could have given acting Oscars to everyone involved... especially Linda Harrison, who plays a mute human named Nova.In the sixties, this was an allegory for oppressive government and animal cruelty-- uses the film still maintains.

As for the story it holds up so well ,because it is so simple, a group of astronauts crash lands in to a strange place were humans are mute act like animal and apes rule. There and during the film we see critics of religion, prejudice, reaction of the established order to keep itself in power and one of the greatest plot twist in film history.That's all I have to write about this film, for let's be real many critics in both the press and Youtube have gave much more analytic and in depth looks for this film and I have been partially inspired by them and use some of their notices.Overall this film must be in everyone list of films to see before you die.",Planet of the Apes

In Tribute To Charlton Heston",10,6 April 2008,"On April 3rd,1968 (2 months and 10 days before my birth)""Planet of The Apes"" was released for movie-goers. 40 years and two days later we now say farewell to Charlton Heston.I just heard the news of his passing at 9:25pm last night on my local news. Most of us know Heston for his 3 biggest roles,Moses in ""The Ten Commandments"",""Ben-Hur"" and his unforgettable role of astronaut George Taylor in this film.I'm not going to go over the plot of the film here,we all know it and love the movie for it. As boys in the 1970's,my brothers and I could not get enough of this adventure,including the later Saturday morning cartoon and the movie sequels.Overall,though it's this original that we'll always like the most. Heston (as well as the other actors playing ape/humans) ""makes"" this film in his simple but powerful performance.From fighting to not be treated like an animal (the way we humans sometimes treat animals and each-other),his fighting the simian authority (a parallel to what was going on in America in 1968) to his painful discovery at the end of the film that man had destroyed themselves long ago.The other great irony of Heston passing away last night is that it also came just two weeks after Easter,for which his other film ""The Ten Commandments"" was and still is a holiday staple on those weekends that Easter fell upon. Although I never agreed with his support for guns,I can agree that he was one fine actor,the likes of which we'll never see again.May he rest in peace.(END)",Planet of the Apes
141,deanofrpps,Gone Ape!,9,1 January 2008,"Planet of the Apes was certainly one of Charleton Heston's finest roles. Despite a slow beginning stretching over 15 minutes bordering on tedium and the quick loss of no less than three pivotal characters and the belated introduction of the major themes and characters in the screenplay, the film manages to portray two late 1960s era liberal themes peace and ecology surprisingly without excessive preaching or moralizations.What if the world turned upside down and simians ruled and humans kept away from the farms and used for medical experimentation? As constructed in this screen play there is an interesting side issue that successive civilisations hostile to the point of mutual exclusion take root in each other. This concept of mutually exclusive civilizations first broached in Planet is more fully developed in Beneath the Planet of The Apes.",Planet of the Apes

Even now this makeup looks effective and considering that this film was made almost 40 years ago this was a very impressive step forward in that field. The makeup artist for the film was given an honorary Oscar for his achievements here as the Academy did not have a makeup award at the time.Taylor (Charlton Heston) the lead astronaut of the story is the protagonist and while Heston can be somewhat limited in his range he is for the most part quite effective. More impressive though are Kim Hunter, Roddy McDowall and Maurice Evans as the three lead apes. These three give very effective performances despite the limitations of considerable prosthetic makeup.The film was well directed by Franklin J Schaffner (Papillon, Patton) and based on the novel by Pierre Boule (Bridge on the River Kwai). The somewhat experimental score by Jerry Goldsmith was also quite good and is very evocative.The success of the film would spawn a slew of increasingly inferior sequels (see the other disc's in this set) and eventually a TV series. More recently the film has been remade by Tim Burton. While the remake definitely had the edge on production values the story wasn't as strong and it didn't come close to living up to the ending of the original",Planet of the Apes
143,GeorgeRoots,Dr Zaius DR ZAIUS!,10,16 November 2013,"""Planet of the Apes"", was a french novel released in 1963 that asked big, interesting questions. Would humanity eventually be bested by a similar species? Or would humanity ultimately destroy itself? Seeing obvious potential, 20th Century Pictures acquired the rights to make a film, and the result has spawned one of Science-Fiction's most iconic pictures of all time. Since then, it has gone on to release countless sequels, remakes and prequels. George Taylor (Charlton Heston), and his fellow astronauts get lost in space and eventually land on a deserted planet. After travelling far they are eventually separated and end up in the hands of intelligent apes, who on this planet have surpassed humans as the dominate species. Taylor, who is temporarily muted becomes the subject of cruelty to both the apes and the caged humans who lack intelligence and the ability to speak. Will Taylor regain his voice? and just what awaits him on such a rural planet?Charlton Heston is fantastic as out-of-his time character George Taylor, whose constant questioning of the ape's society leads to much annoyance on their part. Linda Harrison is just as iconic as ""Nova"", who does so well even though she doesn't have one line of dialogue. And of course the show stealer was Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans), who remains arrogant even though his entire beliefs are constantly being destroyed by Taylor's rational actions. The special effects at the time were considered brilliant, and famously went through a lot of people before final decisions. Considering how laughable they really look by todays standards, I still enjoy watching them. The shots in the desert are bleak and harsh, and when the screenplay is co-written by Rod Serling (Creator of my favourite TV series ""The Twilight Zone""), It's so easy to see why this film is a classic. Final Verdict: A brilliant piece of Science-Fiction, that will stand the test of time for many no ape-dominated years to come. 10/10.",Planet of the Apes
144,PeterRoeder,One of the best movies of all time!,8,9 August 2003,"This is a splendid movie. Like other great horror-fantasy films (Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) it explores the relationship between humans and non-human beings. In ""Planet of the Apes"" there are only three animals: man, ape and horse and they play out their drama in this futuristic desert land. Unlike so many bad fantasy films, this one has a highly authentic aura around it. It is so utterly convincing like a story by H.P.Lovecraft or like one of your own nightmares and dreams. So strange, so fantastic! The words ""The Forbidden Zone"", I will never forget. The ending, of course, is so wonderfully eerie and shocking, one just gets goosebumps for hours. A child will never forget the experience of seeing this movie and she/he will learn so much about human relations with non-humans by witnessing this movie which explores the ethical theme with style and power.

The backdrops range from bleak and desolate, to lush and green. Ape City has an architectural style that is different and primitive, yet strangely familiar. The same can be said of the score, written by Jerry Goldsmith. The story revolves around a group of 4 astronauts that are sent into an 18 month space mission. They crash land on a planet that seems alien to them. Thats where the fun begins. Charlton Heston plays what most likely is his best role (a gun toting ape killer). All the actors do an excellent job in portraying an evolved simian. This movie has the elements of social criticism, action sequences and comedy. It is a reversal depiction of the way humans have been know to treat other creatures and other humans (the humans are now the mistreated). You are torn between your emotions. Taylor makes some good points at the beginning about the nature of man and people. At the same time you are cheering for him, you also have the feeling that this treatment of the humans isn't entirely undeserved. This movie gets better each and every time I see it. This movie is a must see movie. Coming up - Planet of the Apes : The Musical !!!",Planet of the Apes
146,Coffee_in_the_Clink,Excellent cinematography and make-up,7,28 January 2020,"*Major spoiler regarding the ending in this review*Charlton Heston is Taylor, one of three astronauts who survive a crash-landing on an unknown, earth-like planet two-thousand years in to the future after hibernation on board a deep-space voyage. The planet appears desolate and void of life until they come across some human-like creatures in a jungle. They join these creatures but are then attacked by gorillas on horseback. The three astronauts are captured and Taylor finds himself locked up in an enclosure. To his horror, the apes are intelligent and speak English. Taylor's throat has been wounded and he cannot speak to them, but one of the ape scientists called Zira recognises his intelligence and begins to give him special attention. This does not sit well with Doctor Zaius, the Minister for Science and the Faith, especially once Taylor begins to talk and speaks of having crashed-landed in a spaceship and trekked in from the Forbidden Zone. What is it that Doctor Zaius is so afraid of? And will Taylor somehow avoid having his brain experimented on?First thing I have to say about ""Planet of the Apes"" is that the make-up effects are brilliant for the time. The apes really look great. To truly appreciate it one just has to compare the apes here to the ones in the sequel released two years later; ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"". That was made on a much lesser budget (surprisingly) and make-up for the most part was substituted for rubber masks, which are laughable. The one other commendable thing here is the cinematography. Fantastic shots of the astronauts walking through the desert at the beginning. Really gave the sense of a barren, alien world. The film is full of memorable moments and dialogue so I don't need to comment on that. What troubled me, however, upon another viewing last night, was how come it does not occur to Taylor until the ending that he is on planet Earth all along? Because there are quite a lot of things here that could have given it away. The physical similarities for starters, followed by the naming of the humans as 'Humans' by the apes and the archaeological findings in Cornelius's cave. It still does not take away from the breath-taking final scene, however. One of the best in history.",Planet of the Apes
147,Eternality,"The mystery and thrill of the original still remains, and is undoubtedly one of the more fascinating films to grace the screens in the late 1960s.",9,25 June 2011,"Planet Of The Apes is a science-fiction adventure that doesn't need light saber battles, flying spacecrafts, or aliens to keep viewers entertained. In fact, there's nothing significantly sci-fi other than that it's set thousands of years into the future on an isolated planet.Created by the writer who gave us The Bridge On The River Kwai, Planet Of The Apes is an exploration of the existence of intellectual beings other than Man. Why it's an eye-opener is because there's no other film (which I've seen) that directly shows the inferiority of Man over another species that we know. We have seen films that emphasize Nature's superiority over man in disaster flicks, but this is clearly something uniquely different.Director Franklin J. Schaffner loves making films that pit Man against the harsh physical environment (e.g. the hostile jungle in Papillon, the hot battlefields in Patton). Now in Planet Of The Apes, we see barren, isolated landscapes similar (but not equaled) to Lawrence Of Arabia.Cinematography-wise, it's as beautiful as it's stark. Moreover, famous composer Jerry Goldsmith's striking yet strange score helps to accentuate the primeval mood of the place. Charlton Heston's performance is a balanced mixture of boldness and vulnerability, though not as great as what he had achieved in Ben-Hur.The most notable aspect of Planet Of The Apes is the costume design, and the makeup effects by John Chambers (who won an honorary Oscar for his pioneering work here). It's incredibly realistic, to the extent that the talking apes become humanistic, and have personalities attached to them, rather than just being shallow talking apes.The chilling climax somewhat compensates for the average screenplay, and the plain script. There have been several sequels, and a remake by Tim Burton over the decades; but unfortunately they don't even work half as well as the original, becoming diluted and commercialized respectively. The mystery and thrill of the original still remains, and is undoubtedly one of the more fascinating films to grace the screens in the late 1960s.GRADE: A- (8.5/10 or 4 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.",Planet of the Apes

The scene when we see the half buried remainings of the one time symbolic Statue of Liberty is one of the great moments in movies, those that stay in your mind for ever (such as the airport final scenes in ""Casablanca"" or ""Psycho""s sequence when Vera Miles discovers Norman's mother in the basement or Gary Cooper throwing his star in the dust at the end of ""High Noon"" and many others).""Planet of the Apes"" is an excellent and most imaginative sci-fi film that turns into classic just for that final outcome.

Rich will get richer, poor will get poorer, weak will be oppressed by the strong, the strong will dwell on fear they install upon the weak and people in general will get dumber and dumber unless someday something will unite them all together and make them see what they really are - just damn dirty apes.""Planet of the apes"" is a sci-fi classic, it stars Charlton Heston as the main protagonist, an astronaut who travelled through space and crash-landed onto a planet inhabited by a society of intelligent apes. The picture was based on Pierre Boulle's novel of the same name but rewritten slightly by maestro Rod Serling, a mastermind behind ""The twilight zone"" and then again by Michael Wilson who found Rod's script impossible to make on a budget of only 5 million dollars.I have to admit, on the first watch I already knew the plot twist at the end because it was spoiled way too many times before I even laid my hands on the movie but the experience was something extraordinary nonetheless. Such colorful satire on today's society - even after more than 50 years since its premiere nothing has truly changed - people are represented as lower beings, slaves under much more developed apes, and then comes this arrogant human being who thinks he is the most developed of all only to be caged along with the others - such irony.Jerry Goldsmith wrote one of his best scores ever for this picture (and even received an Oscar nomination for it) - his mysterious and unsettling music guides you throughout the movie, not allowing to escape the planet of the apes.

Two SF masterpieces were released that year: 2001 Odyssey in Space and Planet of the Apes, objectively these films are not exactly in the same category although it could draw some comparisons. Of course, I adore both movies.Monkeys are put in the foreground, you can see that right from the title, but this movie is not about monkeys per se at all. This film speaks primarily about us humans and is extremely critical through the various social issues and oppositions that the director poses in the relationship between humans and apes. The film contains several great scenes, memorable quotes as well as an unforgettable last scene that puts an end to everything shown until then and completes the whole story. To me personally in the top 10 endings of all time. I have to mention Charlton Heston who brilliantly embodied an American astronaut going on a distant space expedition to find some great discovery. Since the film is from 1968, it looks great visually, especially the monkey masks, a lot of effort was then put into makeup and costumes to make the monkeys look faithful. What's scary is that this film is timeless which means that absolutely every critique and question then addressed is equally valid today, over half a century later.One of my favorite movies to which I gladly return every couple of years.",Planet of the Apes

It has a interesting story, great performances by several actors, and great memorable scenes.An astronaut named Taylor travels through space and winds up on a planet that has apes as the superior race and not humans. Humans here are primitive and not able to speak so it comes as a surprise when Taylor speaks to the apes and causes many questions to be asked.Charlton Heston is great as the lead in the role of Taylor. One of the greatest actors of all time in my opinion and this might be his best performance in a film in my opinion. He really plays a character you can get behind and root for. That alone is reason enough to see this film.The supporting cast is great as well. Kim Hunter is great as Zira, the open minded psychiatrist who becomes friends with Taylor. Maurice Evans is great as Dr. Zaius the not so understanding Orangotang who is the villain of sorts in this film. Roddy Mcdowell is great as Cornelious, the archaeologist chimpanzee. Mcdowell is one of the main reasons Planet of the Apes as a film is series is so great as he returns to give great performances as several ape characters throughout the rest of the films, except Beneath the Planet of the Apes.The story is great and the action scenes are pretty well done.

155,brefane,That Statue of Liberty is one tough lady!,6,11 March 2005,"Somewhat dated and dumb. The sets,costumes, and make up aren't even state of the art for 1968. In the same year, Kubrick's ""2001"" had actors playing apes more convincingly, and ""Barbarella"" had more interesting sets. Some of the exterior sets in ""Planet of the Apes"" looked like they were influenced by the ""Flinstones"".A clever premise has not been developed with interesting or convincing details. The script is uneven ,contains inconsistencies, and lacks a strong conflict and point of view. And except for Kim Hunter, you don't necessarily care about the characters. Heston seems a bit long in the tooth to be an astronaut. And these astronauts of the future are none too bright. Wouldn't Heston and crew have looked at the sun, the atmosphere, and the topography, and realized that they were back on earth? Can you say Utah? And wouldn't they have guarded their only possessions (clothes and backpacks) more carefully? I'm assuming their backpakcks contained something necessary and useful for their survival and protection.And it's never made clear what the apes plan to do with the humans. Why don't they lobotomize Heston as they did ""Landon""? Why shoot Heston, and then nurse him back to health? Especially since he represents a truth the elders want to suppress. And in this ape society, who's in charge? The apes seem brutal at first, and then benign, like Disney characters. And is there a munitions factory somewhere on this planet? Where do they get their guns and amunition? And could the Statue of Liberty remain intact after the destruction of the world?Franklin Schaffner uses space and geography imaginatively. Some of the situations are interesting, and the dialogue is sometimes clever and witty. The film begins slowly, and too much time is wasted on scenes of the apes refusing to acknowledge or deal with the obvious;that Taylor is an intelligent being. Overall, it's reasonably entertaining and worth a look. Not a film that can stand repeated viewings or scrutiny. If you like ""Planet of the Apes"", try John Boorman's ""Zardoz""(1974) which is weirder, more imaginative, and intense.",Planet of the Apes
156,HelloTexas11,almost great,8,18 November 2007,"'Planet of the Apes' is a film I've watched at least a dozen times, and I never tire of it. I'm not even exactly sure why, but after a few months have passed and I pop it into the player again, it's like revisiting an old friend. I saw it when it first came out and my feelings toward it haven't changed much since then, when I was 12 years old. One thing I've always been curious about and need to research someday is how much of Rod Serling's original adaptation made it into the final script. The two biographies of him that I've read didn't say much about 'Planet of the Apes.' It seems to me, as someone who loves 'Twilight Zone' and much of Serling's writing, that quite a lot of his script survived. The cynicism, the talkiness, the liberalism, the satirical jabs at organized religion and its inherent hypocrisy, even the nuclear bomb-themed twist ending... all classic Sterling. Certainly Charlton Heston's opening monologue, when he asks, ""does man, that marvel of the universe, still make war against his brother?"" could only have been written by Serling. But the whole film pretty much follows the same tone, which again leads me to believe that most of what Serling wrote was left intact; either that, or Michael Wilson (the other credited screenwriter) is a Serling clone! The film itself looks like a medium-budget affair, at best. Most of the sets resemble those of a late-sixties TV movie, or an episode of 'Star Trek.' The special effects are hardly special; just adequate enough to do the job. The real attention-getter when the film came out was the ape make-up, which was considered astoundingly realistic at the time. It's still impressive in its way, allowing for quite a lot of facial expressiveness by the main characters, but like so many technical aspects from that time and before, it will come up lacking and seeming phony to today's younger audiences who have grown up with CGI and other much more dazzling and realistic effects. Heston carries the film; without him, 'Planet of the Apes' would probably seem a lot more foolish than it does. He is bitter, heroic, noble, and cynical; his George Taylor is even at times a Christ-like figure, as when he is stoned by the ape mob and endlessly tied up and taunted by the guards. At its core, 'Planet of the Apes' is a rather heavy-handed spoof of organized religion. Time and again, we hear the elders of the ape community talk about ""heresy"" from younger apes who don't understand that ""the proper study of apes is apes."" Man is a soulless animal to them, lacking ""the divine spark that exists in the simian soul."" The point is hammered home again and again that organized religion is narrow-minded, unwilling to accept new ideas even if they're true, and almost always, inevitably, corrupt. The now-famous ending was such a shocker at the time that it somewhat obscured the fact that it was really very downbeat. 'Planet of the Apes' has been called 'near-classic science fiction'; it's a bit too goofy in places to be taken completely seriously, and yet has many powerful moments.",Planet of the Apes

The hunt scene alone, with apes riding horses, carrying guns and killing humans was truly horrifying. The musical score was also unlike anything I had ever heard before and added an additional element of creepiness to the film. Everyone knows the story by now but it was a very good movie at the time. I saw it not long ago, and it has lost some of its edge. While the make up and the entire concept was brilliantly executed back in 1968, it looks a little worse for wear today. While miles above the the remake, the original still manages to pack a wallop with originality alone.",Planet of the Apes
159,robsta23,Good Sci-fi with Great Underlying Meanings,9,13 March 2015,"It is really a shame that movies often parody the iconic ending of this film because it takes away the shock factor from the conclusion of the film. I think that iconic ending is even portrayed on some DVD covers/posters.While the ending is easily the strongest aspect of the film, there are other great aspects throughout as well. There is clear commentary on race and social structure as the gorillas, the apes with the darkest skin tone, are at the bottom of the social pyramid while orangutans - the lightest-toned apes - compose the class of doctors/intellectuals.I personally think this movie is similar to Inherit the Wind in a way since when Heston's character is on ""trial"" the orangutans refuse to hear evidence that suggests man is an intelligent being. It is almost like they are rejecting the possibility that the apes may have evolved from man, just as in Inherit the Wind the judge and prosecutor reject the possibility of evolution while they consider the Bible and the story of creation as a truth rather than a belief. We realize it is BS to reject these possibilities when Heston's character points out that surely an ape would not make a doll of a human girl that could talk; surely man was intelligent on this planet at one point or another.The orangutans' trying to suppress the truth in this film connects to the possibility that our government keeps certain truths hidden from us, and like we believe to be the case in reality, the orangutans are successful at suppressing the truth; what a disappointing reality.Unfortunately the way the film looks makes it feel like a ""B"" movie when it clearly has ""A"" material. While the make-up is very impressive, it is excess at points since the ape lips do not match with the words that come out of their mouths. Also, there is some really corny dialogue in this movie, such as ""well, you know what they say: human see, human do."" ...Really? But I guess this is redeemed with ""Get your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!""This is a film with ""A"" status that could have achieved perfection with just a few tweaks in its style.",Planet of the Apes

The three survivors traverse miles of desert before reaching signs of civilization. But the humans they encounter are incapable of speech, and seem to have the mentality of animals. Suddenly mounted apes on horseback appear, rounding the humans, their slaves like cattle. One of the astronauts is killed, another is put beneath the surgical knife, and the third, George Taylor(Charlton Heston) is struck on the head, causing him to temporarily lose his speech. The ape city is primitive compared to human settlements, and the apes are xenophobic to an extreme: they both fear and hate the humans, since their myths warn them of man's destructiveness. Taylor befriends two ape scientists, who help him escape when the ape leader sentences him to a frontal lobotomy. the human rides north into the forbidden lands, where he comes upon the head of the Statue of Liberty on a sandy beach.

161,Artimidor,"A one of a kind sci-fi masterpiece, creative and ingenious",10,30 December 2011,"It was Rod Serling of ""Twilight Zone"" fame, who initially penned the screen version of Pierre Boulle's not particularly successful novel ""La planète des singes"" and was responsible for preparing it to eventually become a cult movie. While rewritten several times later on it was the genius of Serling who was attracted by the potential of the material, laying out timeline and rules already in a first draft. These guidelines would also be followed in the four sequels of the Ape films of the seventies to eventually form a whole cohesive unit. The initial movie of course is the great one, the one with the most powerful impact, the shocker, the one that irritates, disturbs and asks all the questions. The rest of the movies in the series for sure is inferior and more pedestrian than revolutionary, yet they are all part of one great sci-fi idea and therefore should be treated as such.As for the first ""Planet of the Apes"": The picture has all good science fiction needs and more - it deals with the consequences of evolution, mankind reaching its final frontier, the ultimate philosophical questions about existence and becoming. The scenery is great and believable, Charlton Heston and recurring ape performers Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter are standouts, Jerry Goldsmith hits the right chords with his avant-garde compositional techniques producing an innovative off-beat score and the make-up achievement was phenomenal for its time. At the bottom of it all lie the thoughts of creative minds, and we should be thankful that ""Planet of the Apes"" made it on screen pretty much unharmed in its ingenuity.",Planet of the Apes
162,smellthecult-com-1,They're monkeys. Monkeys on horseback.,9,7 November 2009,"The legendary monkey world classic, this more than stands up to the test of time. Charlton 'cold, dead hands' Heston plays George Taylor, an astronaut, part of a team placed in cryogenic suspension for exploratory purposes. When they are awoken, the ship is in distress and crash lands on an unknown planet. The survivors struggle from the craft before it sinks beneath the ocean waves and find themselves on a desolate world, barren, apparently lifeless. Lifeless, that is, until they encounter a primitive race, somewhat similar to humans, though without the gift of language. Suddenly, they are attacked by soldiers on horseback. Soldiers that are, quite literally, apes. Heston is taken prisoner and, from there, it is all about his attempts to convince the monkey overlords of the world that he is not merely a beast, but a thinking, sentient creature, deserving of both freedom and respect. Inevitably, those in charge take some convincing, eager as they are to maintain the status quo and reluctant as they are to acknowledge that humans can be thought of as anything but dumb animals.Considering that this movie is now more than forty years old, the visuals have to be seen to be believed. The simian suits and masks are a revelation, being mobile and full of expression, and even the spacecraft in the ocean and THAT final scene is breathtaking. Sumptuously directed, with real flair, this only drops a mark due to the loss of momentum as the dialogue does become slightly repetitive as the message of the movie is slammed home.A genuine sci-fi classic, with one of the most iconic endings going, this is essential viewing.",Planet of the Apes
163,patryk-czekaj,The most amazing Apes movie of them all,8,19 June 2012,"It's sad to say that nowadays the magnificence of the original Planet of the Apes has been overshadowed by the very bad remake made by Tim Burton in 2001. Unfortunately, many people don't appreciate the enormous level of innovation and freshness of the idea that was behind the first and, irrefutably, the best film in the Apes series. I have always admired science fiction pictures that didn't focus mostly on the excessive amounts of special effects, but were able to pass a deeply ideological, strange, interesting, and sometimes frightening in its realism, message to the viewers. And Planet of the Apes definitely has this amazing quality, with which it's able to grasp the attention from the first minute. Just like 2001: A Space Odyssey, or Star Wars a few years later, it was able to change the way people perceive this very authentic movie genre. When George Taylor (Charlton Heston) and two of his companions land on a distant planet in the far-away future, they realize that highly intelligent apes, which use humans as their slaves and guinea pigs, inhabit it. Right after a mounted army of apes captures them, they understand that people living there aren't able to speak. When two young scientists, Zira (Kim Hunter) and her husband Cornelius (Roddy McDowall), notice that Taylor is actually able to think and form sentences, and tells them where he came from, they gradually start to believe him. However, a very emphatic and strict Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) doesn't share their joy and wants to silence Taylor for good. It's as though he was hiding a mysterious and groundbreaking secret, which would probably be too serious and shocking to bear for the citizens of this planet. That's why he wants to keep the man in a cage, and experiment on his brain, just to make sure that he won't claim any more of the heresies. After a series of mistrials, Zira and Cornelius are finally able to help Taylor escape from the town and they all travel into the Forbidden Zone. It's a place where no ape is permitted to go to, as it's pronounced deadly. However, the true reason behind this injunction is that the overwhelming secret, which could destroy the apes' community, is hidden somewhere in the vast land of this deserted place. It's simply marvelous, how many grand and complex philosophical and religious connotations this movie possesses. It may really astound anyone that the notions and ideas stated in the picture are actually not that far from the truth. Looking at our civilization, and the way it's heading, it may be scary to realize that the vision that we see may some day be real, even 2000 years from now.The costume designs, characterization and make-up are perfect, making the apes look surprisingly humane, intelligent, and superior to our race in nearly every aspect.Fantastic cinematography accounts for many beautiful views in the beginning of the movie, as the travelers roam around the deserts and jungles of a planet that's not really that different from Earth. The movie has also probably one of the most astonishing ending sequences in the history of film. I know that some of the viewers were able to find out the truth somewhere in the middle, but it's still a discovery of the most shocking kind. All in all, I urge you to watch Planet of the Apes from 1968, and forget about any other versions or sequels, as they might only spoil the awesomeness of this first Apes production. It's an extremely serious, clever, and bizarre take on the future, which will definitely move and impress not only hard-core science fiction fans.",Planet of the Apes
164,NerdBat,Review,8,12 March 2018,"We all know what Planet of the Apes is, but not all of us have seen the original films, or any of the films for that matter. I have to hand it to them, this film really was a masterpiece of science fiction, up there with ""Dune"" and ""Star Wars"". It has a subtlety that can't really be felt in films like this. There is action, suspense, and drama of course, but its not so much so that it has you on the edge of your seat. I was amazed at how far they went, even during this time period to make everything seem so real and well made, especially the sets. The ending, I won't lie, was quite infuriating, and probably one of the most widely discussed cliffhangers you'll ever see in your life. There are parts that get you a bit irritated though, say, problems that could easily be solved seem to be Greek to some of the main characters. Other than that though, there isn't much negative you can say about this film. I truly liked it, and look forward to continuing the series.",Planet of the Apes
165,CMTiago,Truly one for the ages,8,25 July 2014,"I can now see why this movie is regarded as the classic it is, an rightly so if I might add. Starring the charismatic Charlton Heston as the brash Taylor, an astronaut who has landed in a strange planet in which the apes are the dominant species, POTA offers an entertaining sci-fi action experience, as well as providing with an allegory that will be discussed long after the movie is over, which for me is always a good thing.So as previously said, Taylor and his crew find themselfes stranded on a distant planet after their ship crashed. Between finding out that they're 2000 years into the future and that during their hibernation a fellow crew memeber has died, they seek answers that could help them survive this new environment. Soon after, they spot the humans who now are mute and lack any sort of intelligence. In ambush, one of them is killed and Taylor is captured. Due to a wound in his neck, he is unable to speak at first. Still chimps (the smartest apes) like Zira & Cornelius, soon see that he isn't like the other humans, and soon after he professes the famous ""get your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape"" line, Taylor will come at odds with the evil Dr. Zaius, who seems to know more than he shows. And soon enough, you will be surprised (if you don't already know it).Planet Of The Apes is a prime example that a film can be full of thrills, but also very enlightening and actually worth investing time and knowledge. Now one of my favorite movies, I hope to catch this movie in further viewings, as I well leave both entertained and puzzled in the best of ways.Rating: 9/10",Planet of the Apes

167,merrywood,The One and Only Apes Fest,9,22 November 2014,"PLANET OF THE APES (1968) This original production, inspired by the 1963 Pierre Boulle novel, La Planète Des Singes was cast well, with a screenplay co-written by none other than Rod Serling. However, someone marred it by injecting period politics. It still stands out as the ""one and only"", primarily because it was the surprise evolutionary reversal that made it great and launched it into the Pantheon of Classics.The ensuing milking of the original in the following years was nothing more than various filmmakers attempting to cash in. The first sequel was somewhat interesting but it takes the story beyond known and theoretical science into metaphysics, thus, shattering the original concept. In my humble opinion, it is not a true sequel in that it varies wildly from the original concept, creating its own plot line and becoming silly, actually, with the introduction of malicious, telepathic super humans. That is like a bad pastiche on good art. The following ""sequels"" are not worth watching.The 2001 re-make of the original, with a bizarre script and completely incomprehensible ending that essentially tells audiences they have just wasted two hours of their lives and a few dollars, was stillborn, mostly because Tim Burton, who can claim some merit for other movies, such as Mars Attacks, is still no Franklin J. Schaffner.If you have not seen this original obtain a good copy of it and stick with it. You will be disappointed with anything that follows it.",Planet of the Apes
168,Idiot-Deluxe,A fantasy classic and one of the creative high-points of the 1960's.,8,23 May 2017,"Planet of the Apes is the first and easily the best film of what would unfortunately become a mediocre franchise. But when it comes to the first film, what we are treated to is a strikingly distinctive classic of science fiction, as well as a marvel of creative and intelligent film-making; one that's filled with many wondrous sights and sounds - but by no means is Planet of the Apes a perfection production and it's not without it's flaws. By now most are familiar with the movies plot, which revolves around it's striking, sometimes brutal depiction of a primitive world, that's inhabited by intelligent apes that's dictated by their own strict, often belligerent brand of simian rule. Simply put, the movies basic premise is certainly one that would turn anyone's perception of reality completely on it's head.Starring Charlton Heston in one of his best and most important roles as the main character/space traveler Captain George Taylor (really a name more fitting for a truck driver or a plumber, then an Astronaut), whose in command of a crew of four (counting himself) and of their mission....... well let's just say things don't go as planned and that there are many surprises ahead - a whole movies worth. Planet of the Apes is in many ways a visually stunning film (for it's era), one that's brimming with beautiful location photography of many exotic locales (which is especially true in the beginning and end of the film), which fills your screen with many splendid wonders of the natural world. But even more importantly in creating this fantasy was it's extravagant and ground-breaking use of animalistic make-up and latex prosthetics, which at that point had never before been attempted on such a vast scale. Throughout the film you'll see dozens upon dozens of people, painstakingly fitted out in the image of upright walking ""apes"" with cloths, these remarkable transformations were achieved through the brilliant wizardry of the make-up department of 21st Century Fox Studio.Another notable contribution to the greatness of this film which cannot go unmentioned, is the phenomenally effective music of Jerry Goldsmith; who for this feature created a thrilling masterpiece of abstract film scoring. To my ears it's a surreal and transportive experience, one that thrusts you into an exotic sound world, filled with unsettling tension and foreboding atmospherics, that are constantly ebbing and flowing in perfect harmony with the movies glorious visuals. Many of the scores more unusual sounds (and there are many) were brought to life by a wide array of obscure instruments, from far-off foreign lands from around the world, such as Africa and India. Nearly every significant moment of the film is underpinned by Goldsmith's masterful music, which rings forth in a broad spectrum of mesmerizing tones and textures. In a highly prolific career that spanned nearly half a century, the music of Planet of the Apes is likely maestro Goldsmith's best and most creative effort to date, so much so that it's my opinion his music outshines everything else and is the best and most memorable aspect of the film. His music is just that good.On the negative side of things this movie does have it's short-comings and I do have a few complaints, which if you're at all familiar with the movie, is certainly not unfounded. Such as the poorly realized Ape City, which is far from impressive and is underwhelming in it's scope and scale, much more time, money and effort should have gone into it's construction; and at the very least it's size and grandeur could have been bolstered by the use of models and miniature sets (and on a very minor side-note, if you haven't noticed, every single wooden door seen on the sets look fake). Then there's the unwavering self-conceit and irritating ""higher-than-thou"" personality of Dr. Zaius (Mr. Positivity himself), his haughty proclamations of superiority get mighty tiresome and repetitive - you simply can't act that superior and not expect to wreak of conceit. Then there's the films action element/screen violence to speak of and judge and with the exception of ""The Hunt"" none of the films action-sequences are particularly impressive or hold-up to repeated viewings; and even though they are unique, many movies before and certainly after have much better action scenes. Another negative is that during the very last shot of the movie (the long-shot on the beach), if you haven't noticed, the films resolution nose-dives and as a result the image quality simply looks terrible, the degradation is hard not to notice, as it's anything but subtle.A brief word on the string of inferior sequels that followed this film, starting with 1970's ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" which as far as sequels go is actually pretty decent, but definitely not as good as it's predecessor. However beyond that first sequel all other installments of the franchise were done on progressively smaller budgets and sadly, but not surprisingly, get more and more pathetic with each and every movie. As far as the first batch of Planet of the Apes films goes (there currently is a revival of the franchise with the release of two new films) only the first film is essential viewing. And if you're a completest somewhere in the middle of all that, is the one-off that Tim Burton ill-advisedly made back in the early 2000's - which is not worth mentioning any further.",Planet of the Apes
169,schroeder-gustavo,Deep and thought provoking,10,22 September 2015,"The name of this franchise is now unfortunately stained after a few unnecessary sequels and a Tim Burton reboot. Fortunately, with the recent release of the excellent films Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, the name of the franchise is starting to shine again.But some people forget the long-running franchise started back in 1968, a great year for science fiction with 2001: A Space Odyssey and Planet of the Apes. The original film, directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and starring Charlton Heston. The plot is basically a group of astronauts go into hibernation in their spaceship traveling near the speed of light, until they wake up years later in an unknown planet, run by intelligent apes, which treat humans as inferior animals.I'll just start off by saying Charlton Heston is absolutely brilliant in the role, he steals every scene he's in. Watching this movie after over 45 years it came out I am pleasantly surprised to see the effects still look pretty good. I honestly have almost no complaints with Planet of the Apes, the acting is solid, the directing is pretty good and the costume design is amazing.The only minor complaints I have are the pacing may feel a bit slow at times, but that's it, and it really is minor.But story-wise, Planet of the Apes is brilliant. Now, I won't spoil anything in this review, but the widely known twist ending at the ending of the movie is one of the greatest twists in the history of cinema. As a first time viewer, not knowing anything about the movie, it's really necessary to allow that ending to sink in.Planet of the Apes is a landmark of science fiction cinema, not only a great movie, but an important one, a thought provoking masterpiece that raises important questions still relevant today.

170,jake-law123,The biggest pleasant surprise from a movie.,9,15 March 2015,"My brother highly recommended this movie to me one night. I was expecting to enjoy it...I was not expecting to completely fall in love with it. Insanely excellent writing, completely likable characters, strange, yet original twilight zone style story, good cinematography, and awesome sets make this one of the best classic films of all time.Three astronauts land on a distant planet after being in hyper sleep for 2000 years during a space expedition. On the planet, human beings are wild animals, and apes are civilized and rule all. Ape scientists Cornelius and Zira, who are trying to prove the early existence of humans before ape, may have found the answer when one of the astronauts provides intelligence.The setup is brilliant. It quickly sets up the plot with clever twists and shocking turns, and introduces the characters in a clever fashion. For 1968, it looks really sharp. The story does look like something that came right out of the Twilight Zone. It's definitely kind of corny, but it takes itself seriously enough to be a convincing plot. The setup is interesting, the makeup and costumes are very good. Nobody can be identified in their roles.All the cast and characters are fantastic, the supporting roles in particular. My favorite character is Zira played by Kim Hunter. She's the motherly, sympathetic, intelligent character that defends the astronaut to the very end. By the end of the film, I was attracted to her. Cornelius, played by Roddy MacDowell, just as bad ass, supportive, and intelligent. Dr. Zaius played by Maurice Evans is just a jerk, going out of his way to disprove any former existence of man by sabotaging the astronaut and the theory developed by Cornelius. Charlton Heston is also really awesome. Even though he's the standard pretty face for the leading man, he gets dirty and gritty on certain moments and shouts some of the most famous movie quotes ever.Even though it's relatively a not very eventful film, (not till the end anyway) it's so well shot and well written that you're just invested in everything that's happening. The idea is strange, but they make it work so well with the writing. It just spells classic. You feel confident for the main character and the supporting cast. Even though it ends with a cliffhanger, you leave on a positive, mostly uplifting note.It's simply an amazingly likable film. The dialog is easy to follow, the characters are easy to fall in love with, and it's incredibly imaginative and creative. I'd recommend this to anybody who loves a good classic, because this is a great classic. This film knocked me off my ass, I was not expecting to love it this much.",Planet of the Apes

I knew the basic gist of the movie, but there was quite a bit about the plot that I was unaware of.The thing that struck me most about this movie is that it's such a well made film for the early 70's. I won't go so far as to say that it's one of my favorite movies, and there certainly was a hokey feel to the picture--the apes look strange and much about the movie has a cheesy vibe to it. However, no sooner that I say that, I have to admit that it is refreshing in its approach. What modern movies would do with special effects, this movie does with a set and creative cinematography (I'm thinking especially of the opening scenes now). The film also is a great example of how a compelling narrative can be told without being overly complex. There are many details about the movie that are left up to the viewer to figure out--and indeed, the climax of the movie, and its most important detail of all, is not revealed until the final scene of the film. That scene is iconic and clever, and while I'd seen a clip of it at some point, seeing the entire film certainly adds to its poignancy.All in all I'm giving this movie 7/10 stars.

Heston's comment aside...this is a great film, a wonderful screenplay from Rod Serling and an incredible performance from Maurice Evans as Dr. Zaius are the highest of the films many high points.In fact Evan's as Zaius is the real core of the film. He humanizes (if you can apply that to an ape) the sheer paranoia of those in power who know too many secrets for the good of their society. Its a strong portrayal that should have earned him an Oscar nod. Kim Hunter as Dr. Zira and Roddy McDowall as her fiancée, Dr. Cornelius add some great moments of connection with Heston's Taylor as well.

It also contains a plot-twist that I consider to be one of the best of all time. The makeup is fantastic. The best thing about the film by far is the irony of it all. Not only do apes treat people like apes, but they also have a religion that is like Christianity where they believe that their ape god put them on the planet first then populated it with all other animals much like Christianity's Adam and Eve.

Even if they seem silly, or outmoded, or incomprehensible, there are reasons why they exist, and thoughtlessly discarding them is very dangerous.[POSSIBLE SPOILERS]Throughout the movie, Zaius and the church-state authorities are subjected to merciless ridicule for upholding religious traditions and taboos against Cornelius and Zira's newfangled theories. After all, we smugly know that the scientists are right and the priest-rulers are wrong. This is what cons a lot of people into thinking that this is just another self-congratulatory film about how liberals are so much more enlightened than everyone else (these people, of course, are mostly very enlightened liberals who then go on to make fun of Alzheimer's sufferers because they hate Heston so much).But in the end, it turns out that the reactionaries have got it right.

Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall played the sympathetic chimpanzees Zira and Cornelus and Linda Harrison played the love interest of Charlton Heston's character, Nova. Maurice Evans played the villain, Dr. Zaius and they all played their parts wonderfully.The finale, in which Taylor comes upon a ruined Statue of Libery and realizes that he has been on Earth all along, became the series' defining scene and one of the most iconic images in 1960's film.The make-up was amazing and fantastic and John Chambers did a really great job. Jerry Goldsmith's musical score was amazing and his score was nominated for an Oscar. Morton Haack's costume design was really amazing as well.Overall, PLANET OF THE APES - the 1968 version - is really amazing and it gets a 9 out of 10.",Planet of the Apes
178,robb_772,"The original, and still the best",8,25 May 2006,"Best-remembered for its then-shocking twist ending and John Chamber's pioneering prosthetic make-up, the original PLANET OF THE AOES remains a difficult-to-beat science fiction parable. The film takes the typical ""stranger-in-a-strange-land"" device that was used and reused in countless previous (and future) sci-fi films, but APES manages to successfully attach a level of social commentary that was largely missing from earlier attempts in this sub-genre. The racism/civil rights comparison is the most obvious metaphor at play, but this is not the only clever subtext of the film. The film drawls plenty of parallels to more generalized themes of desperation, alienation, and the social construction of society, while director Franklin J. Schaffner also makes certain that the film fulfills its various goals as a sci-fi adventure as well.The film is further grounded by Charlton Heston, who lends the film the benefit of his layered theatrics and his undeniable screen presence. Heston's trademark tough-skinned machismo is the perfect match for this larger-than-life film, and he remains on the genre's all-time greatest pulp heroes. No matter how outlandish or preposterous the proposed situation may be, Heston always manages to find the emotional core of the scene and believably relays it to the audience. While I personally feel that Heston became a bit of a sociopath later on in his life, I will always praise his exceptional work in classics like this film and BEN HUR (1959), as well as guilty pleasures favorites like THE OMEGA MAN (1971) and SOYLENT GREEN (1973).The supporting players are also well-cast, with Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter remaining particularly affecting even under all of those ape prosthetics. Maurice Evans, James Whitmore, and James Daly are all appropriately sinister, and Linda Harrison certainly looks good in a non-speaking role. Jerry Goldsmith's then-novel atonal score evokes just the right subtle feelings of primitivism, and the Chamber's aforementioned ""ape"" make-up is still respectable if not quite awe-inspiring anymore. Though followed by numerous sequels (and even a brief TV series) and latter remade by Tim Burton (in a shockingly unimaginative manner), everyone should do themselves a favor and stick with the original.",Planet of the Apes
179,Filmdokter,Not as I expected: more drama than action,7,15 March 2021,"Confession: I only recently saw Planet of the Apes for the very first time. In my younger years I saw the Tim Burton version, and this decades trilogy and based on those I assumed the original was more an action-adventure based film than a drama where all the conversations are about the big questions: how do we treat our planet and all it's inhabitants? There isn't that much action in the film, and it's all the better for it. The apes costumes still look good, the ending (which I knew up front) is still a typical late sixties surprising downer. All in all still a solid and relevant picture, better then practically all its successors",Planet of the Apes
180,moviemattb,My personal favorite movie of the series,10,14 July 2014,"""Planet of the Apes"" is truly my personal favorite movie of the series, and it is one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. I thought the filmmakers put their greatest effort into the project from adapting the novel, and making it a classic movie. Charlton Heston was absolutely outstanding for taking on the role as the main lead, and does make you root for him and feel sorry because of the issues he is having with the apes. The rest of the cast Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, and such were great in their own roles. The makeup design by John Chambers were groundbreaking at the time, but they still look marvelously well done today. I thought the music by Jerry Goldsmith was really very well effective, and I thought he created something more interesting than any other science fiction music that were done in the 50s and 60s science fiction movies. The director Franklin J. Schaffner, who would go on to direct another great movie ""Patton"" has done a brilliant job on the movie. The movie does go by at a very good pace, and does not seem to drag; it really did kept me going, and I thought the premise was very well done as well as the story. The locations for the movie were incredibly well shot, and I do love the look of Ape City. Lastly, I do love how we as the audience wanted to know about how the Apes live and what their society is like. I also would love to give props to the very last minute of the movie, which I thought was very chilling. I love it before, and it still hold up quite well. I give this movie a perfect powerhouse 10 out of 10.",Planet of the Apes

The acting is convincing from all the actors, though Charlton Heston has some really cheesy moments (in the beginning monologue & when he speaks to nova are the worst for me)The film making is excellent, the sets and the society shown in the movie are very believable. the costumes and mannerisms are interesting and reflect the class system, as well as totalitarianism.

183,thewillt08,Instant Classic,8,3 April 2013,"If people deserve second chances, then so do movies, and I gave Planet of The Apes a second chance. I'm talking about the 1968 classic with Charlton Heston, not the 2001 disaster with Markey Mark Wahlberg. This movie was a classic because in the 60s a movie was rare to have a sequel because they usually did not exist. This movie had a sequel because the original was so successful and made a lot of money. I saw it when I was really little and thought the site of apes talking was cool. I saw it again a year or two ago and I thought it was really boring. I decided to see it again and here is what I thought. Charlton Heston plays George Taylor, an astronaut sent out with a team of Americans to find life. They go into a deep sleep and wake up in the year 3978 on an unknown planet where man is uncivilized and apes have a full society. Just the premise of this movie is incredibly unique. Charlton Heston is amazing in all of his roles and this is one of his best, excluding when he played Moses in The Ten Commandments, he plays the loner who just wanted an adventure and an excuse to leave Earth. In the beginning he is a snarky sarcastic punk in a way. He understands the reality of his situation at first realizing that everybody he has ever known is dead. The relationships between he and his two mates push the story forward and brings entertainment as they explore the planet. His charisma is what keeps him alive after they are captured by the apes.The apes to this day still look amazing. They have a slight hunch like an ape and the prosthetics they use were the best of the time period. The year was 1968 and CGI did not exist so actors and extras had to literally be transformed. They looked, and still do look, real. There are two different types, chimps and apes. Chimps are more intelligent than the apes but they live together in peace. The apes are the fighters and higher power in government while chimps are the scientists and common people. One scene chimps are shown protesting something I can't remember but it is a satire of society in the 60s. Little pokes at society and how they connect are shown throughout the movie and I thought it was worth mentioning.Taylor's charisma and intelligence helps him survive as he is the only human capable of speaking, but his throat was injured in the raid and for a while he cannot speak. He tries to communicate with chimps with words and that is a big deal to chimps. Cornelius and Zira are two scientists who study man and they are very interested in Taylor who they call ""blue eyes."" At first I found the lack of action and the conversations Taylor was having with the Ape incredibly boring, but after seeing it with a new perspective, I found it interesting. The way Heston uses his words and acts out his monologues is fun to watch. He has a lot of emotion that is kind of unexpected after the first act introduces his character.Dr. Zaius is one of the head apes in society and he is a well- respected doctor. Throughout the movie we know he is hiding something because he shows so much hate towards the humans. He has a secret he never admits but the final scene reveals the biggest shock and plot twist a movie had ever seen at that time. Nobody saw that coming. I won't spoil it but it just makes you think. Heston delivers one of the most memorable lines in movie history. ""You maniac, you blew it up, damn you, damn you all to hell."" Then the camera pans back, we see the big surprise and the waves of the ocean crash over Taylor who is sobbing, and it cuts to credits. It was the perfect ending to the movie. The buildup was subtle by Dr. Zaius but it was worth it. You go back and watch the movie again and realize what is actually happening. Strong dialogue and something an audience has never seen before made this movie a classic.Overall, Planet of The Apes is a classic movie in Hollywood history. Charlton Heston does what he does best in the lead role and this movie shook Hollywood to its roots. It did have some pacing problems in the middle and I became uninterested. The story seems to drag a little bit and the big picture became unclear but the big punch to the gut in the final scenes save the movie from a complete disaster. The viewer almost has to read in-between the lines to fully understand the greatness of the middle of the movie but nevertheless, Planet of The Apes gets the WillyT Seal of Approval. Would I watch this movie again and again? Probably not but it is a good thing to see a few times and enjoy. Appreciate that in 1968 there were very few special effects so the visuals are kid of terrible but try to imagine back in that time. If this movie came out today as it is, its complete garbage, but for 1968 it is a gem, and I respect that and I approve of the filmmaking, acting, score, visuals, and anything else I am forgetting right now.",Planet of the Apes
184,paulo20,"Allegory that's profound, if a bit silly",7,27 December 1999,"(WARNING: reveals `shocker' ending)This isn't just some cheesy sci-fi flick.  It actually has a thought provoking message, even if it is a bit silly in delivering it; for one, how and why would apes evolve from humans, specifically into more erect versions of orangutans, chimps and gorillas?  But more on that later.One thing that impressed me about this film is the make-up.  The meticulous application of latex masks and affecting performances by Roddy McDowell, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans and others really went a long way into making the apes seems life-like.  Except for one shot where Cornelius had two sets of lower teeth, the illusion was fairly solid.  Another impressive thing, visually, was the make-up.One thing that I must question, though, is the idea of the `shocker' ending. One of the reviews found under the external reviews' section of this site asserts that the film `ends with a shocking revelation about the planet's origins that no one could possibly have guessed'.  I really have to contest that.  I admit, I knew the shocker ending before having even seen the film (yesterday), but I think there were clues that should have tipped off anyone.  First, the planet had humans, horses and apes, which are called orangs, chimps and gorillas.  English words.  The apes speak English.  That should be enough of a clue for anyone, especially Taylor, unless convergent evolution (of both organisms and language) is a common occurrence across planet's in Taylor's society..  I guess since this film is more allegorical and philosophical than scientific (it actually brings to mind Gulliver's Travels), we're not expected to pay much attention to that.  I'm simply saying that the ending isn't as shocking as it's made out to be.And as allegorical as this film is, I think the theory that apes - specific species of apes, no less - would evolve from humans is laughable and sort of undermines the film; also the idea that humans would forget how to talk or make any kind of vocalization.Still, the film works and those flaws I mentioned give the film a surreal, almost creepy feel, which is effective, in its way.  And while I still think the ending wasn't or shouldn't have been that shocking, the shot that revealed it was still masterfully done.",Planet of the Apes
185,leftistcritic,Apes dominate over humans and much more,8,21 May 2019,"After watching The Omega Man (which was paid tribute to in a Simpsons Treehouse of Horror), I watched this film and there was Charleton Heston (Taylor) who quickly becomes the star of the show. I already knew some contours of the story from here and there, perhaps from places like The Simpsons with a musical on Dr. Zayas or even Futurama with Dr. Banjo a parallel to this character. The story starts simple with Taylor recording what has happened on their journey so far, then soon their ship crashes in the water, with their female companion dead. With the men venturing out to the ""new planet,"" everything seems swell until they come upon a group of humans who are quickly captured by apes riding horses and with guns. In this society, apes are at the top and humans are oppressed and at the bottom.All of the crew are captured, except the black guy who is killed (why, he was such a good character) but we never really learn of what happens to Taylor's uber-patriotic compatriot (who literally plants a U$ flag) until much later. All focus goes on Taylor and his ape captors who want to learn about him. He is temporarily mute, but not for long, before he begins speaking and demanding his rights. As it turns out Dr. Zayas is a sort of religious figure who is equivalent to those who believe in creationism while the ape doctors primarily treating Taylor favor evolution. A bit like the perverted nature of Anakin's release by Qui-Gonn Jinn in The Phantom Menace while other humans on Tatooine remain enslaved, Taylor and Nina, a mute girl he met, are basically allowed to go free at the end while the rest of the humans go free.I'm not sure what the ultimate takeaway is from this film, with the final scene paid homage to in the Futurama episode where Fry, Prof. Farnsworth or parodied in Mel Brooks's film, Spaceballs, and Bender travel in the forward time machine, but perhaps it is talking about the brute nature of humans. In another, I could see the argument it is racist in that the humans who are caged are white while the apes are effectively black and are portrayed negatively, with Taylor crying about the ""dirty"" apes. There are many possible interpretations, some calling it inventive for imagining the world upside down, with questions about our culture, with themes about the clash of science, reason, and religion. But it is still a film worth giving a rating of 8 out of 10, especially since Rod Serling was one of the screenwriters.",Planet of the Apes
186,vovazhd,Science fiction classic,9,16 March 2008,"I wish they made more films like this. Planet of the Apes is one of the all-time science fiction greats. It is an allegorical masterpiece that investigates a hypothetical world where apes dominate while humans live in savagery. We see the events from the perspective of a space explorer from our own era. As he criticizes the ape society, it turns out that the problems of his own human society become evident.The film suffers from a short list of problems. The special effects (mainly during the introduction segment) are dated, there are occasional plot issues, and some parts are cheesy. As far as complaints, thats all. The rest is only praise.Planet of the Apes is plain strange at first. The costume design and stage setup is eerily convincing. As we explore the world, things steadily get weirder. The reversal of society seems a bit out of place, but don't let it fool you. There is a hint of an explanation for the entire scenario, but it does not come until the very end.The characters are interesting, to say the least. George Taylor, the main human explorer, usually comes off as arrogant and short sighted. Nevertheless, we can relate to his emotions and he serves as an accurate icon. The friendly apes are wonderful characters, if not a bit unrealistic. At the end, I found myself most impacted by Dr. Zaius. I did not feel for him at all until the end, where my opinion completely reversed.It is interesting that two of the greatest science fiction movies of all time (this and 2001: A Space Odyssey) came out in the same year. They are both incredible experiences and leave an enduring aftertaste. If you like science fiction and haven't seen this yet, shame on you. Watch it now.",Planet of the Apes
187,quiqueperezsoler,Legendary,9,1 October 2020,"-- VERY VERY MILD SPOILERS: for those who want to know what to expect from the movie but don't want to be spoiled of key aspects.The best sci-fi is the one that apart from containing your space and time travel and your blasters and alien civilisations, contains themes of moral and ethical reflection presented in visual concepts. And this classic is the best proof of how such mix can make a movie a legendary piece that still holds on today.As of today, I'm 25 years old, and I don't usually watch movies from before the 1980s (with a few exceptions) as you can corroborate in my ratings. However, is movies like this that make me reconsider and which encourage me to broaden my tolerance for movies of this era. An era where CGI was unavailable yet and the concept of ""full-on dumbed down action-packed loud and flashy blockbuster"" cinema hadn't arrived yet.From the themes of discrimination, animal rights' treatment and, in a sense, religion and science; to the practical effects, costume design and narrative, this movie has all the elements to make it engaging and impactful. Long gone are the days were themes like the main ""theme"" of the movie (reflected on that well known ending on the beach) were conceived and executed the way this movie has. If you think about it, is a very simple concept but it works marvelously in so many levels because the story is constructed in such a way that you learn things as it progresses. It allows you to discover the world next to the main protagonist.With strikes to the human nature and presenting a study on what mankind is capable of, the movie shows very impactful events (like what they did to Landon). But the most surprising of it all is the fact that yes, we are supposed to cheer for the humans to survive this horrid reality they have found themselves on but it turns out there are more layers to peal in this picture. A pleasant turn of events that make you wonder, reflect and contemplate the nature of mankind.IN CONCLUSION, it is hard to talk about the themes of the movie without getting into spoiler territory. But I want to reiterate that this movie exceeded all my expectations. Without the need of special effects, big battles, a huge cast or a more convoluted plot, this film was able to capture the main theme it was trying to deliver and it did so beautifully, with every scene and character serving its purpose without none of them feeling wasteful. I believe the Planet of the Apes movie I watched as a kid was the Tim Burton one but I never quite liked the aesthetic, perhaps I was too young to understand. And I am glad I was, because after I watched the Matt Reeves trilogy, I began to have an interest in the ""original"" that started it all. When a concept is so interesting I develop a need to watch the movie that protrayed it first and started it all. To think how many movies were made related to this concept is proof of the brilliance of it. It is a must watch for every sci-fi lover and for anyone really as it presents themes that would make you think afterwards as well as enjoy it during.",Planet of the Apes

He has that look into the camera that can just describe so many things about his character and portrayal. He has that action hero look yet he is by all accounts a great actor. That is why when he just looks into the camera you get a powerful sense of what is happening on the screen. Heston actually is able to portray a man put into slavery by apes. Somehow though it works.Combined with Schaffner's directing abilities Heston and him were able to really take this movie to another level. Other than the costumes of the apes, even though they were pretty impressive for that time, everything looked very realistic allowing you to really get into the movie. That quality alone of this movie separates this between the ordinary sci-fi movies. It even has a plot. It is something we are all familiar with. A person fighting for their freedom and survival. Like everything else in this film the plot was also taken to another level. The ending was not cheap either it was a bit of a surprise and was really something I won't forget. It was one of those moments in movies you won't forget.

I don't see this as some critic against Sovjet, I see this as a warning to us; lets don't make war and stop destroying things and killing others. But of course it is critic against fanatic religion, I think, but that is hardly what is most important with 'Planet of the Apes', rather that religion can be used to serve a bad system. The Apes are not all the time so very smart, but in that way, they sure reminds of us. Was this how we was in some hundred of years ago?

193,starlit-sky,A Champion Of Imagination in Science Fiction,10,19 August 2001,"Planet of the apes is definitely one of the most revolutionary science fiction movies of all times. It skilfully deals with many diverse and significant issues such as evolution, human/animal rights, racism, prejudice, struggle between religion, science and political/military authority and anthropology, all within the context of a marvellous screenplay written by Rod Serling, who is the creator of Twilight Zone (let's not forget the Pierre Boulle who wrote the original book which the screenplay is based upon). Try to imagine a world-like planet where the evolution has worked mysteriously in such a way that apes have become the superior species and men are still in the elementary stages of evolution, much like early homo sapiens. And if you were to find yourself in such a planet how would you prove that it is possible for humans to be smarter than apes while you are the only example to justify that?I consider Planet Of The Apes in the same category with 2001: Space Odyssey in terms of inquiring the mysteries of evolution. Even though there is no mysterious monolith that makes apes smarter in an evil way, the connection is still there: something is making us evolve in a certain way. The movie presents a bizarre world where the mystery of evolution has favoured the species of the apes. A spacecraft, carrying 4 pilots on aboard, crashes into the sea on such a planet due to a malfunction. Soon, the main protagonist, Colonel George Taylor (Charlton Heston), falls captive to the apes who regularly hunt men to use them for medical researches and sports. It is interesting to see things from the opposite perspective where men is the vulnerable species and apes have all the power, which is referred to as the movie's defining famous motto: ""upside down civilization"".Will Taylor be able to prove that he is not guilty of being blasphemous against the ape society while at same time trying to prove that a human can be as smart as -in fact smarter than- an ape for he, too, can talk and even think? If he can prove the latter, then he is guilty of being blasphemous. If he remains silent, then he will live his life as a captive to apes, which is excruciating to a human who knows the meaning of freedom well. Will he be able to break free from the prison? Will he be able to make it to the ""forbidden zone""? And why is it forbidden to the apes? What humanly secrets does the ""forbidden zone"" contain? Planet of the apes is a champion of imagination in science fiction with a shocking end that will absolutely blow your mind, """"You blew it; you finally blew it. Damn youuuuuuu!!!""

With an excellent premise, good writing, and strong special effects for the time, the movie really is a sci-fi classic.The best thing about the film is the premise – turning the evolution theory upside down is an extremely intelligent idea, and it's handled brilliantly by the writers. It's a script full of wit and irony, with the right level of satire to make the film work. I won't spoil the ending, but it's a brilliant one, rightfully regarded as one of the best endings in cinema history.The use of make-up and costumes is also commendable, especially considering it was the late-sixties. Sure, the apes don't look amazing; but, somehow, it works. As the film goes on, you forget that these are people wearing somewhat mediocre ape costumes – you're so heavily invested in the characters by this point that how they look becomes an afterthought. That being said, Kim Hunter is brilliant as Zira, doing a great job of emoting with her eyes.The let-down, for me, was Charlton Heston. Heston has always had the moniker of being a hammy actor, and he's really, really hammed it up for this film. It's excruciating at times to see him overacting so much, and a miracle that it didn't end up hurting the movie. At the end, he does just enough to keep the film engaging and watchful, and we should all be thankful that the supporting cast are so excellent around him.This really is a brilliant film, and one I thoroughly enjoyed watching. Whatever you may think of the movie, and whatever your opinion of Charlton Heston's acting, nothing can be taken away from it's final couple of minutes. The film is worth watching just for that.",Planet of the Apes
197,fuelrodx,Big in its day,10,12 March 2021,"This was big stuff in 68. And Heston was a favorite. This was groundbreaking at that time, that's why I gave it the high score. It became immediately the talk of the town and so you see a bunch of sequels come thereafter, almost like you can't get enough. But the first one was the killer. The costumes and makeup were done excellently at that time. These are the iconic movies that really make waves. And it seems to last",Planet of the Apes
198,taldarus,Replaced?,5,17 July 2021,"I have to question if this one has been replaced by the newer movies in my opinion.They are, however, very different stories.This movie has not aged as well as some others in its time frame. For a long time this movie was amazing.",Planet of the Apes
199,rtp4242,Planet of the Apes The original doesn't monkey around with CGI.,10,27 July 2014,"George Taylor (Charlton Heston) and his fellow astronauts, Landon (Robert Gunner) and Dodge (Jeff Burton) take off with a female astronaut Stewart (Diane Stanley) to test theories about time in deep space. They fall asleep and wake up to discover they've crash landed in an ocean on some planet in the year 3978. Stewart dies at some point while they were sleeping, and Taylor, Landon and Dodge barely make it out of the spaceship before it sinks. They make it ashore, and traverse a huge desert where nothing can grow. They've got three days to find food, or they die, they find a flower, then some weird looking scarecrows and finally trees and a flowing stream of water. The astronauts make it to a corn field where they see some mute prehistoric humans. Taylor thinks he'll be running this planet in no time. But then things grow eerily quiet, there's gunfire and creatures on horseback. The humans all instinctively run, the creatures hunting the humans are gorillas, and they mean to kill every last human they see.Taylor and Landon survive the hunt, but Dodge does not. Taylor is shot in the throat during the hunt, and loses the ability to speak. taken to Ape City where he's given a blood transfusion, and survives. Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) is a chimpanzee animal psychologist who is fascinated by Taylor's attempts to speak. Her boyfriend Cornelius (Roddy McDowell) is a chimp archaeologist, who's done some interesting digs to find out about the origins of the simian society. Taylor communicates to Zira and Cornelius through handwritten notes, a human who can communicate is a direct threat to the order of the society that Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) Chief Science Officer and Defender of the Faith has built. Zaius orders that Taylor be neutered, immediately. Taylor learns of the plan and escapes the cage where he is kept, after a long chase, just when all seems lost for Taylor, his voice comes back and he cannot be killed now because he can speak.Taylor is given a show trial, and remanded to Zaius' custody where he promises to spare Taylor if he outs his talking human colony. Taylor says there are no others and faces certain death. Does Taylor die at the hands of Dr. Zaius? Does Taylor ever find out more about this strange planet where apes rule over mute men?I first watched this movie on TV in the 1970's, when I was around five years old, to my five year old mind, gorillas riding around on horseback hunting humans was the coolest thing ever. As I got older, I understood the many complex issues discussed in this movie, nuclear war, evolution, the tension between faith and science (very timely these days) time travel, animal experimentation, even the cruel treatment of animals in captivity. The trial of George Taylor was similar to the Scopes trial, with apes arguing over evolution instead of humans, there was even a social pecking order in the ape world, with orangutans having most of the powerful government functions, chimps doing the scientific work, as it were, and gorillas doing the military work. All these facets in the story and the fact that the screenplay was co-written by Rod Serling, the genius behind The Twilight Zone made this movie endlessly entertaining and fascinating. The other co-writer Michael Wilson, co- wrote such classics as Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge on the River Kwai, The iconic line ""Take your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape"", comes at such a pivotal point in the movie, and is so perfectly delivered by Heston, that the viewer cannot help but cheer that line. The script is not perfect however, most notably regarding women, the female astronaut is killed before ever leaving the ship, Nova is mute, and once Taylor talks to her, he says some incredibly sexist things to her. The strongest feminist voice belongs to Zira, who in a lot of ways is not only Cornelius equal, but superior to him, prodding him to act when he is too timid.The acting especially by Heston is superb, he doesn't play his usual epic hero, like Moses in the Ten Commandments or Ben Hur, in this movie he is an anti-hero, much in keeping with the times, the turbulent 1960's. Heston's character George Taylor didn't like people much, he didn't even like his fellow crewmembers, he thought he had all the answers, in other words, he is a character in search of a comeuppance, and boy does he ever get one. But as the last intelligent member of humankind, the viewer can't help but root for Taylor despite all his shortcomings. Roddy McDowell was still feeling his way in this movie, he has some good lines but he plays the chimp Caesar with much more command in the later movies. Kim Hunter gives an exceptionally strong performance, I just realized that when watching it now, she is the one who moves the story along, and she has some of the best lines, including a comedic one to Heston. She played Stella in Streetcar opposite Brando, so obviously she can act. Maurice Evans was also superb as Dr. Zaius, the tension was palpable in the scene between him and Heston in their scene alone in Zaius office. The direction was eye-catching by Franklin Schaffner, who directed Patton and the Boys From Brazil, another favorite of mine. Schaffner adds many unique touches to this film, The plane crash in the beginning of the film, grabs the viewer immediately, the chase scene that ends up with Heston speaking is gripping, how he waits till the last possible second to show the apes in the hunt scene to get the full shock value is amazing, and of course the last scene is one the most iconic in movie history.For more reviews to go ape over, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",Planet of the Apes
200,roystephen-81252,Disappointing if you've read the novel,4,26 February 2016,"My first encounter with Planet of the Apes was through an artistic, black-and-white comic adaptation. As a child, I loved it. Later, I read Pierre Boulle's original novel, and I thought that was fantastic, too. With that background, I was seriously disappointed with the 'classic' film. (To be fair, though, the later cinematic renditions weren't any better, either.)I understand some of the filmmakers' decisions, like changing the ape society into a less advanced one, as the novel was practically unfilmable with the then available technology, but the oversimplification extended to the story and the characters, as well, and because of that little remained of the spirit of the book. The design and makeup of the gorillas are cool, Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter give fine performances, and the last scene (being a clever twist on the book's ending) is very effective and memorable, but overall the film feels cheap and shallow, at least compared with the book. It could have been much much better.For me, the third movie in the franchise, Escape from the Planet of the Apes, proved to be the most enjoyable. By basically turning the original story inside out while remaining faithful to both the plot and the spirit of Boulle's excellent novel, that is the one that got closest to the mark.",Planet of the Apes

That was the first time I ever remember feeling depressed. Well, I got over that and became a big fan of the series. But after all these years and looking back and re-watching the films, it becomes a lot more clear that these films got worse after ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"". Anyway, the first film has some great shock value but got too ""preachy"" with dialogue regarding one political issue after another. Charlton Heston began with this film a long line of career mistakes.",Planet of the Apes

And at the end Heston sees the Statue of Liberty and realizes he's on Earth all along. Wouldn't the fact that the apes speak English be enough of a clue or did he think it was just an incredible coincidence that apes on another planet spoke English? Why all the downvotes?

204,Yonhap S,Excellent sci-fi,9,26 January 2000,"Although this movie shows its being dated, it's an excellent masterpiece up to now.  You'll notice that the apes are in a caste system.  The gorillas do the grunt work, chimps are benign and pretty much peaceful, and orangutangs appear to be in the higher order.  There is the question as to why humans in the movie can't speak, but it's something even one of the sympathetic chimps wonder.  The apes are afraid of him because he can speak and think for himself.The tension in the story holds to the question how Taylor will survive in the ape colony.  We sympathize his frustrations as he wish to be free and find answers as what truly happened.

206,eragonbookfan,WOW was this bad!,2,4 June 2014,"To start off, I am a *HUGE* Charlton Heston fan! Seriously, Heston has  given much better performances in films such as ""The Greatest Show On  Earth"", ""BEN-HUR"" & ""The Ten Commandments"". I reckon you check those  out before you see this overrated pile of worthless nothing. Believe me  when I say this flick is over-hyped & overrated as HECK! The fact is...  I DON'T GET IT! Why is this film so popular? Did I watch the exact same  movie that everybody else is raving about???  I'm really surprised the end credits didn't say this motion picture was  a work of FICTION, or that the characters were fiction! 'Causer I  pretty much don't like this FRANCHISE as a whole! And I don't care a  SPECK that it's based off a book (because I'm never reading that.) And  don't even bring up the RECENT films - those apes look so fake. An  animated ape will NEVER look like a real ape, no matter whole long you  work on animating it!  But the ape masks in this film looked *so* fake, it was hard to take  those characters seriously! (LULZ) That's why I have to shamelessly  give credit to the 2001 Tim Burton version, because the makeup looked a  WHOLE lot more impressive, convincing, and well-done.  Also, for most of the movie, Heston doesn't talk for some reason just  because he gets shot in the neck (???) And a lot of times he often  stands around with his clothes off (naked), and screams the H-word and  the D-word.  Seriously, how is this a G-rated film!? (Suggested MPAA: PG-13 for  intense sequences of violence, nudity, language, and menace)  I am certainly GLAD I did not grow up with his film! Because, I  would've likely lost half of my brain if I did! I mean, not only do I  hate the fact that Charlton Heston, one of the greatest actors of all  time, took part in this confusing & uncomfortable stinker, nor that it  started a whole career of bad film choices for him, nor that I believe  this film is mostly just loved by the sweaty-nerd,  Darwinist-brainwashed, junky bozos who have a rather BAD taste in  film...  ...but the theory of evolutionism is existent in this flick, and even  tries to be RAMMED down our throats. How?? It's all in the visuals,  rather than dialogue. Darwin's theory as a whole is NOT true! And it  isn't Science! Too many buy into it, & it's not true because the  ""majority"" believes it, like they used to believe the sun went around  the earth.   Don't believe me?? Science says so!   2/10  ""2"" for one of my favorite actors being IN the film.",Planet of the Apes

Astronauts fly through space at a speed fast enough for significant time dilation to happen, so time for them is much slower compared to time for other things.

One dies on the ship, one is killed in an attack, and one has part of his brain cut out. The other meets one of the human like animals and they both leave with the help of friendly chimpanzee-like apes. On the beach, the astronaut sees the Statue of Liberty, revealing that the planet is Earth. There are some things that don't seem realistic in the movie. How did they end up back on Earth? Why didn't Taylor seem to think it was strange that the apes were speaking English? Any catastrophe big enough to change the landscape like that would have obliterated the Statue of Liberty.

It's totally shocking seeing apes civilized, but it gets worse when we see that them treat humans like animals (they call them like that). As I said, there's so much philosophy to analyze o:The acting is good, I saw the movie 45 years after its release, I can't even say that I don't like it.The location also is very good, all that desert civilization is very well done, the human cages are a good idea.

210,jbirtel,The Ultimate Twilight Zone Episode! In Color!!,8,19 July 2002,"Let's travel back to the year 1968!By now, most everyone has color TV...for the past three to six years. And color TV was no where near the quality of today's TV's. And you better have an antenna on your roof (even the click dial rabbit ears on top of the TV set didn't cut it). Before then...black and white! So going to the movies, especially the films made in technicolor, was an event. This is still almost a decade before cable TV becomes the norm. Science Fiction???  Not exactly rare...but not mainstream either.Now comes 'Planet of the Apes'! A fantasy sci-fi film that gets a rating labeled ""M"" ('M' for mature audience...Really!!!). This is before the standard 'G', 'PG'...ect.If this review sounds subjective rather than objective, then you're primed for 'Planet of the Apes'. This is a film that came at a crossroad when 60's movies were influenced by new wave cinema while Hollywood tried to desperately cling to old fashion (but still effective) method of tried and true storytelling. This also premiered before the superior '2001: A Space Odyssey' (an even more effective subjective presentation) that would historically influenced elevating sci-fi to its proper place.
(Subtle Spoilers) From the opening scene of interstellar stars hurtling past the windows of a light speed traveling spaceship, to its closing moments, the film carries the viewer on an adventure that jerks our emotions from satire to deadly dilemna. Just don't look too hard and enjoy the ride. And that's all 'Planet of the Apes' intends to deliver: a sci-fi epic-like odyssey; a few jabs at human behavior; a tweak to laugh at our own faults; the consequence of blind tradition; and a flip-side of a culture we detest while subconscience-wise admit we are guilty of. But then again...it's a damn good example of what a movie is meant for: suspend your belief for a couple of hours and enjoy some pure escapism from life's (sometimes) harsh realities.Fortunately, the studio took alot of care to restore the film to its near color brilliance that aging chemicals in the negative nearly disintegrated. You may have to pump the color of your TV spectrum controls a few notches to fully appreciate how audiences experienced the wonder of 3 strip technicolor that is no longer utilized, (Godfather PART II in 1974 was one of the last to use the 3 strip method). This is very effective, especially scenes that were filmed outdoors, unlike the 2001 remake (yes...remake!) that tried to cheat the viewer. The 1968 version was before CGI, so outside in the blazing sunshine meant that it was filmed outside in the hot blazing sunshine.Arthur P. Jacobs was the rolling stone that combined so many talents at the right time, and the right time ripe for constantly improving the end result. This is one of Hollywood's few times when so many that were involved, kept improving the project, before a green light was granted to start filming.Charlton Heston is perfectly cast as iconic hero. So is Kim Hunter! And Roddy McDowall (especially Roddy who gave much more in the ensuing sequels than the writing merited; except, of course, 'Beneath...'). And Maurice Evans! And especially; Franklin Schaffner's unique vision that spawned an entire franchise. Bottom line; the Original is best!From Pierre Boulle's novel, to Rod Serling's interpretation (many drafts), to Michael Wilson's polish, 'Apes' exceeded everyone's expectation in 1968! Jerry Goldsmith's score embeleshed a futuristic suspense combined with Ape culture insanity as 'Taylor' is the eyes and ears of a world ""turned upside down"". The film dares to allow the surviving astronauts to slowly trek across an alien landscape before discovering the planet's true horrors. And then the fun begins! Bizzare landscapes; paradise short term; The Hunt; Ape City; the escape; a kangaroo court; defending the human race; a revelation!! 'Planet of the Apes' has character, color, costumes, humor, scenic vistas that are real, imagination, thought provoking attributes; and a nice twist!Attention:  WIDE SCREEN only!!! Before movies in the 70's figured that many people would see a film on TV anyway and framed it with that in mind, 'Planet...' in pan and scan loses almost 50% of the image. This is one movie that is symbolically 'off center'; and most of the dialogue and action take place off to the side where a story tells as much on an actor's reaction to an actor's action. THE only way to see this is Wide-Screen!!8 out of 10!  If you saw the 2001 Tim Burton's film...then the original 1968 version gets promoted to a 9 out of 10!To everyone famliar with Rod Serling's 'Twilight Zone'??? Enjoy It!!!",Planet of the Apes

There's at least three epic memorable moments of cinema: the booming dark tones of trumpets & bassoons as we get the first sight of apes.""get your filthy paws of me you damn dirty ape!"" and of course, the ending reveal.The rest of the film is also brilliant: nicely-paced, good deep dialogue, well acted, great make-up, believable characters, cinematically-shot, perfectly-weighted use of dramatic music and the introduction to a huge mythology.The classic-era sequels are also interesting, tho' the general quality tails off quite a bit.

214,bellabanana93,Excellent Sci-Fi With Amazing Acting And Landscapes!,10,24 October 2017,"The Planet Of The Apes (1968) is an Adventure/Sci-Fi movie starring Charlton Heston as George Taylor. Although the main focus of the movie is science fiction, there are some funny moments and some sweet moments as well. The movie begins with Charlton Heston, an American astronaut, talking in the control room and then later, after the main title sequence, the astronauts awake from their beds. The ship begins flooding and they attempt to signal to Earth to inform them that they have landed. They cannot save the ship so they grab life jackets and abandon it. As they exit, you can gather that they have crashed onto a planet with water and dark red sand mountainous islands. They get their life raft and begin to paddle while their spaceship sinks so they realize they will be unable to get home. At first, it is unknown what planet they are on and what kind of species the planet is inhabited by. As they get to land, they test the environment with some of the equipment they salvaged from the crash. They only have enough food and water for 3 days so they will need to explore the planet and find another way to eat. The acing is great and the landscape is stunning. The movie will leave you wondering and questioning what will happen next. The special effects are excellent for its time. While exploring, lightning which looks realistic is simulated to add to their journey. A heavy boulder almost falls on them as it crashes into pieces and forces them to run around it. It all looks magnificent. You won't believe that the movie was made in 1968. The astronauts find life in the form of a plant and they seek out to find more of it. Eventually, they find a waterfall and bathe in it. Something steals their clothes and equipment. Upon investigation, they realize it is a being that looks similar to humans but appears to be mute and less intelligent than homo sapiens. Their humanness is shown as their first thought is to rule over these less intelligent beings.When the apes appear the first time, very intense orchestra music plays. The human- like beings get scared and immediately begin running for their lives. It is apparent why they ran when the apes, mounted on horses, begin shooting at them. Considering the movie is so old, the apes look pretty decent.. at least as decent as they possibly could at that time. We find out later that the apes are able to speak. This Sci-Fi classic will take you on an adventure as it follow's these astronaut's journey on The Planet Of The Apes.

Because it broke new ground. Go watch The Maltese Falcon. Hard to watch by today's standards, but an original that set the stage.Low reviews from young movie goers of today, finding fault with the acting in Planet Of The Apes, the special effects (yes the ape masks are not convincing by today's standards) and bemoaning the familiar plotting all miss the point.This film was made over half a century ago. Acting was experiencing the beginning of the method movement, special effects still hung onto stop motion animation in many instances, but there were more original stories, purely original, than there are today.Give it a watch. Sure, Heston's style is at times unintentionally campy, but starring in a science fiction film about talking monkeys was a huge risk back then.It would be decades later that Star Wars would make science fiction cool, and later still for Jack Nicholson (as the Joker) to prove that great actors could elevate a film even when based on comic books or pulp fiction.So, for all those modern day goofballs rating this a 2 or a 3, please go back to the Transformer movies and enjoy yourself.

The 1968 film is first a great story. Second it is a great allegory about our society. Third it is a great drama. Fourth is a great example of story telling. You are first introduced to main character on board an futuristic spaceship that can travel near light speed. Then you are led to think they crashed landed on a desert planet on the way home. At this point you find out the main character hates human society. He became an astronaut to find something better than man. Then you find that the primitive humans seem to populate the planet, and the astronauts think they will be running the place in six months. Then you find out apes run the planet and treat humans as we treat apes. As the astronaut learns about the ape society, he begins to yearn for the human society he hates. We also see parallels that comment on our own. You can see Rod Serling's hand in the script. The twist at the end - that the planet is Earth in the distant future makes the astronaut hate human society, that he has just begun to want, even more.If you follow the story of this film, all the sequels are impossible. The people who launched the space mission would never had sent the rescue mission of the second movie, because they would have know the spaceship would return in the future when they all were long dead.

Charles Heston is great and perfect as Taylor in this movie, and Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall as Zira and Cornelius. Maurice Evans gives a great performance as Dr. Zauis, the leader of science and religion for the apes who is too stubborn to admit that humans were the dominant species and in the end he knew it all along. The ending(made by Serling) is one of the most shocking endings in film history. The make-up work is a triumph. It won an Honarary Academy Award for make-up. This movie succeeds at going against racism and how organized religion can really hinder the truth.",Planet of the Apes
220,TheBillionthGuyNamedJack,Weirdly Haunting,10,5 August 2020,"This film was not at all what I expected. I thought it would be a story that was more like most other movies around the time, something that was good based on acting on action. But this film is based on something else. The film contains many off putting surreal moments, such as Charlton Heston bursting into laughter over a miniature American flag, which also reflects what many people thought of America during the time. Surprisingly, a world where humans and apes reverse roles is actually unsettling to watch, it is an brutal and crudely unforgiving but well-painted portrait of society around the time.The apes and Charlton Heston's character Taylor using slurs against each other, not just in role reversals, but also those that reflect racism and classism. The film's main message is how we react when we find something that destroys our beliefs. The apes in the story actually represent us, how when we find something that throws away everything we know, and try to suppress it, so as to make seem it doesn't exist. our lives, those of people around us, government, and religion are unknowingly built on terrible, painful lies.I won't spoil the plot twist, so as to make this public, but if you know it beforehand, it will still get to you, no matter how well you know it.",Planet of the Apes
221,Rasalgheti_2000,the best science fiction movie ever....,10,25 January 2011,"despite being far, far away from the original Pierre Boulle's novel, this movie is undoubtedly the best exponent of science fiction, especially by critics as cruel and stark self-styled makes our civilization. Taylor at first shown a masterly monologue is indeed very happy to leave Earth, wondering if it exists something or someone better than mankind in the Universe. And it seems that . The fact that an inferior species dominate us and make us see our faults as clearly as did Dr Zaius in the minutes before Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty into rubble, is really the climax of the whole movie and is what he has to make us think really, to change our destiny. It is not science fiction that humanity is on the road to self destruction.",Planet of the Apes
222,terryzhangtianrun,blablabalbslb,8,7 July 2021,"The story goes something like an astronaut Taylor comes out of hibernation and discovered himself in a world that is ruled by roughly developed apes who are particularly similar with human and men are uncivilized and mute. Taylor was captured to the apes' city and tried to prove the rightfulness and the intelligence of human but at the end found himself on Earth to a few thousands of years later, which means the human kind was ruined by its own breed.The movie has some very interesting elements. Worlds are upside down and in a way the movie puts a mirror in front of us. The human beings are humiliated in exactly the way we treat animals. What would we do if another mammal suddenly knew how to speak our language? We would probably react the same as the apes do in this movie and therefore it is even more interesting. The movie is ironic about mankind. It reveals all evil hidden inside our behaviors. As Dr. Zeius says: You are right, I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand and hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike creature who gives battle to everything around him, even himself.",Planet of the Apes

I was expecting something kind of campy and cheap, but it was actually pretty clever and well done.  It's another example of how Hollywood has de-evolved over the years.  What movie made today would allow 30 minutes of three men wandering in the desert just for the sole purpose of emphasizing their isolation?  I haven't seen the 2001 re-make, but I bet more time was devoted to overblown action sequences than intelligent debate about ethics, theology, and science.I really did like it, but it struck me as being little more than a beefed up episode of ""The Twillight Zone.""

Planet of the Apes is still way better than all of the sequels and remakes that has even been made.I remember the first time, I watched Planet of the Apes. I was a major Sci-Fi geek who loved Star Wars and Blade Runner. I was sitting down on the couch with my nerdy glasses, watching T.V. When all of a sudden the movie started, my friends told me the movie was very cheesy and lame. So I had extremely low expectations, but I told, whatever, I'll give it a try. After the film finished, I was completely flabbergasted and amazed to have seen this work of art. The visuals were great and the movie was extremely entertaining. But that's not the main reason I loved the film so much. It raises a lot of questions about our modern day society without letting social commentaries get in the way of the drama and action.The movie is easily one of the top ten best Sci-Fi films ever created, it stands high up with Star Wars, 2001 A Space Odyssey and The Day the Earth Stood Still.

This edition will FINALLY present the film in 16x9 anamorphic widescreen, and hopefully with an improved stereo mix.  It will also include a lot of extras, though many have been available on DVD elsewhere for some time, but what is really pleasing is that a Jerry Goldsmith commentary on his score will also be included. Goldsmith's score is a motion picture landmark and has never been out of print on LP, cassette, and CD.  It's a dream come true to finally get some Goldsmith commentary on it.  The DVD will also feature some twenty minutes of behind-the-scenes footage that the late actor Roddy McDowall, also an avid photographer, shot with a 16mm movie camera during production.  All too brief snippets of it were used in the 1998 AMC documentary ""Behind the Planet of the Apes.""  This should be fascinating to APES fans, but of course the enduring elements of a movie that has proved to be a timeless motion picture SF masterpiece will be the main attraction.",Planet of the Apes
230,haristas,"Apes must be remembered, Charlie!",10,31 October 2002,"Here is Pauline Kael's review from the February 17th, 1968 New Yorker:
""Apes Must Be Remembered, Charlie"" ""'Planet of the Apes' is a very entertaining movie, and you'd better go see it quickly, before your friends take the edge off it by telling you all about it.  They will, because it has the ingenious kind of plotting people love to talk about.  If it were a great picture, it wouldn't need this kind of protection; it's just good enough to be worth the rush.
""Adapted from a novel by Pierre Boulle, 'Planet of the Apes' most closely resembles George Pal's 1960 version of H.G. Wells' 1895 novel 'The Time Machine.'  It's also a little like 'Forbidden Planet,' the 1956 science-fiction adaptation of 'The Tempest,' though it's perhaps more cleverly sustained than either of those movies.  At times, it has the primitive force of old 'King Kong.'  It isn't a difficult or subtle movie; you can just sit back and enjoy it.  That should place the genre closely enough, without spoiling the theme or the plot.  The writing, by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling, though occasionally bright, is often fancy-ironic in the old school of poetic disillusion.  Even more often, it is crude.  But the construction is really extraordinary.  What seem to be weaknesses or holes in the idea turn out to be perfectly consistent, and sequences that work only at a simple level of parody while you're watching them turn out to be really funny when the total structure is revealed.  You're too busy for much disbelief anyway; the timing of each action or revelation is right on the button.  The audience is rushed along with the hero, who keeps going as fact as possible to avoid being castrated or lobotomized.  The picture is an enormous, many-layered black joke on the hero and the audience, and part of the joke is the use of Charlton Heston as the hero.  I don't think the movie could have been so forceful or so funny with anyone else.  Physically, Heston, with his perfect, lean-hipped, powerful body, is a god-like hero; built for strength, he's an archetype of what makes Americans win.  He doesn't play a nice guy; he's harsh and hostile, self-centered and hot-tempered.  Yet we don't hate him, because he's so magnetically strong; he represents American power -- the physical attraction and admiration one feels toward the beauty of strength as well as the moral revulsion one feels toward the ugliness of violence.  And he has the profile of an eagle. Franklin J. Schaffner, who directed 'Planet of the Apes,' uses the Heston of the preposterous but enjoyable 'The Naked Jungle' -- the man who is so absurdly a movie-star myth.  He is the perfect American Adam to work off some American guilt feelings or self-hatred on, and this is part of what makes this new violent fantasy so successful as comedy.
""'Planet of the Apes' is one of the best science-fiction fantasies ever to come out of Hollywood.  That doesn't mean it's art.  It is not conceived in terms of vision or mystery or beauty.  Science-fiction fantasy is a peculiar genre; it doesn't  seem to result in much literary art, either.  This movie is efficient and craftsmanlike;  it's conceived and carried out for maximum popular appeal, though with a cautionary message, and with some attempts to score little points against various forms of establishment thinking.  These swifties are not Swift, and the movie's posture of superiority is somewhat embarrassing.  Brechtian pedagogy doesn't work in Brecht, and it doesn't work here, either.  At best, this is a slick commercial picture, with it's elements carefully engineered -- pretty girl (who unfortunately doesn't seem to have had acting training), comic reliefs, thrills, chases -- but when expensive Hollywood engineering works, as it rarely does anymore, the results can be impressive.  Schaffner has thought out the action in terms of the wide screen, and he uses space and  distance dramatically.  Leon Shamroy's excellent color photography helps to make the vast exteriors (shot in Utah and Arizona) an integral part of the meaning.  The editing, though, is somewhat distracting; several times there is a cut and then a view of what we have already seen from a different angle or from much higher up. The effect is both static (we don't seem to be getting anywhere) and overemphatic (we are conscious of being told to look at the same thing another way).""The makeup (there is said to be a million dollars' worth) and the costuming of  the actors playing the apes are rather witty, and the apes have a wonderful nervous, hoping walk.  The best little hopper is Kim Hunter, as an ape lady doctor; she somehow manages to give a better performance in this makeup than she has ever given on the screen before.""",Planet of the Apes
231,haristas,"Great, for a Variety of reasons",10,31 October 2002,"Here's the February 7, 1968 review from Variety:""'Planet of the Apes' is an amazing film.  A political-sociological allegory, cast in the mold of futuristic science-fiction, the Arthur P. Jacobs production for 20th-Fox  is an intriguing blend of chilling satire, a sometimes ludicrous juxtaposition of human and ape mores, optimism and pessimism.  Franklin J. Schaffner directed star Charlton Heston and a strong supporting cast.  Production values, especially outstanding makeup, plus Jerry Goldsmith's score, maximize impact.  Strong entertainment assets for general audiences, plus concurrent -- and perhaps controversial -- appeal to more sophisticated viewers, add up to excellent b.o. prospects.
""Pierre Boulle's novel, in which some stranded U.S. space explorers find themselves considered animals in a world dominated by apes, has been adapted by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling.  Script at times digresses into low comedy -- many common phrases in which 'simian' and 'ape' are substituted for 'human' and 'man' -- and, whether intended or not, audiences will be inclined to laugh rather than to grin at the irony.  Perhaps this was a gambit for mass appeal. ""In any case, the totality of the film works very well, leading to a surprise ending, although, in hindsight, it could have been deduced all along.  Yet, the suspense, and suspension of disbelief, engendered is one of the film's biggest assets. ""Heston, leader of an aborted space shot which propels his crew 20 centuries ahead of earth, is a cynical man who eventually has thrust upon him the burden of reasserting man's superiority over all other animals.  At fadeout, he is the new Adam.  Linda Harrison,who has appeared in some recent 20th pix bits, is herein formally 'introduced' in a totally silent part of the new Eve. ""Key featured players -- all in ape makeup which obscures their regular facades, yet permits subtleties of expression -- include Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter, two scientists accused of heresy; Maurice Evans, their adversary in the Inquisition which forms a major plot sequence; James Whitmore and James Daly, two other ape Establishment functionaries.  John Chambers is given special creative makeup design credit, and it certainly is deserved. Ben Nye and Dan Striepeke executed superbly the makeup design.
""Rather precise parallels exist in the allegorical writing to real world events over, say, the past 20 years.  Suppression of dissent by fair means and foul; peremptory rejection of scientific data by maintainers of status quo; double-standard evaluation of people and events.  It's all here.
""Screenplay probably could not have been filmed 10 years ago, and the disturbing thought lingers that it might not be possible in another 10 years, when engineered public and political opinion again swings into another distorted extreme.  Despite the immediate world turmoil, climate appears to be in a dead center which in life, as well as in mechanics, cannot long endure. ""Schaffner's direction generally is sure throughout.  Leon Shamroy's versatile Panavision DeLuxe Color lensing accents both the macroscopic and microscopic dramatic elements, with adroit and neatly restrained forays into subjective technique, per director's obvious intent.  Goldsmith's score, orchestrated by Arthur Morton, lends an excellent mood.  Overall establishment of setting is, in the best sense of the word, a successful con. ""In smaller roles, Robert Gunner and Jeff Burton, as Heston's space crew survivors, serve to fix star's initial character; their eventual demise in plot is logical.  Lou Wagner, as a young ape intellectual, and Buck Kartilian, as a gorilla zoo-keeper, help reinforce the ape civilization setting which, in some spots involving principals, is strained (but never broken) in credulity. ""There is some medium and long-shot male buttocks nudity, but handled with care and free of obvious exploitation sensationalism.  Hugh S. Fowler executed editing to 112 minutes.  It is debatable whether about 10 minutes could be trimmed, particularly in first two reels; film would play better, internally, yet the deliberate establishment of the strange world -- which successfully gulls an audience -- could suffer.  In any case, once story begins to move, it keeps going. ""Other technical credits are first rate.  Film exteriors were shot in Utah and Arizonia National Park country, where desolation and grandeur of an indifferent Mother Nature matches perfectly with the desired story setting of the results of an insolent Human Nature.""",Planet of the Apes
232,haristas,A Landmark SF film,10,31 October 2002,"1968s PLANET OF THE APES has been my favorite film since I first saw it in April of that year when I was eight years old. The movie had a huge impact back then and I cannot emphasize more the power to grip the imagination it had -- and has -- and the shock the final image of the movie was back then. I literally left the theatre stunned and speechless. No other movie of my youth had such impact, or created such suspension of disbelief. Over the past thirty-four years PLANET OF THE APES has attained classic status and it's a tribute to the film's excellence that there are so many comments left here on the Internet Movie Database that this film is better than the viewer thought it would be, or that it wasn't campy or cheesy as they'd always thought, or that it was more intelligent and thought-provoking than most films they've ever seen, and that despite the studio stupidly putting the final shot -- one of the most famous last shots in the history of American cinema -- on the cover of the video, they were still stunned and haunted by it.PLANET OF THE APES is based on a 1963 French novel, ""La planete des singes,"" by Pierre Boulle, most famous as the author of ""La pont de la riviere Kwai"" (1952), which became the 1957 film THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. The story tells of a French journalist, Ulysse Merou, who, in the year 2500 travels with two companions in a near-light speed spacecraft to the red-giant star Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion. There they find a sister planet to earth, Soror, and after landing on a remote plateau discover a race of human beings that are no more than animals, naked and unable to speak. The three earthmen are stripped of there clothes by the humans, who hate anything that isn't natural. Their spacecraft is destroyed by the savage people and they are run off into the jungle. The next morning the tribe of wild humans are attacked by hunters, who are gorillas dressed like men, hunting like men, and acting and speaking like men. One of the earthmen is killed, another disappears, and Merou is captured, taken to a research lab, and subjected to scientific experiments.A sympathetic female animal psychologist, Dr. Zira, a chimpanzee, is intrigued by Merou keenness and soon learns that this man is highly intelligent and able to learn speech. With her help Merou learns all about the simian civilization on Soror, in which the apes live in modern cities, drive cars, fly planes, and watch TV, and where conservative orangutans, especially one named Zaius, so fear this intelligent human being that they seek to have him destroyed. With the help of Zira's fiance, an archeologist named Cornelius, Merou unwittingly discovers a secret about the origins of intelligent life on Soror that's so dangerous he's forced to flee the planet of the apes and return to earth.Boulle's novel is a satire in the tradition of Voltaire that mocks humankind's anthropocentric theory of the universe from which human beings derive their sense of importance, and is laced with the kind of harrowing ironies that Boulle was famous for.The movie based on this book is an 'Americanized' adaptation of it. Rod Serling did the first drafts of the screenplay, simplifying the plot by fitting it into the mold of his ""Twilight Zone"" TV series and introducing an anti-nuclear war theme not present in the Boulle novel. Because of budget constraints the modern ape civilization had to be reduced to a less technological one, something more reminiscent of ancient Greece. In fact, after Michael Wilson, who had also adapted Boulle's ""Bridge Over the River Kwai"" to the screen, was brought in to do the final script drafts what emerged was a political allegory more akin to an Aesop fable than a Voltairian satire.An improvement on the book was to turn the Merou character, now named Taylor, into a misanthrope and to reduce the scope of the story into a kind of 'misanthrope's comeuppance.' Charlton Heston was a perfect choice to play the unlikable American astronaut, having essayed such similar 'bastard' roles in 1954s THE NAKED JUNGLE, 1963s DIAMOND HEAD and 1963s 55 DAYS AT PEKING, and the movie would be a lot less funny and pointed without him.Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter, as Cornelius and Zira, and Maurice Evans, as Dr. Zaius, enjoy some of the best performances on the screen, bringing the then-innovative makeup design of John Chambers to life under the intelligent and stylish direction of Franklin J. Schaffner. Also excellent in this Arthur P. Jacobs production for 20th Century-Fox is the veteran cinematographer Leon Shamroy's Panavision lensing, which makes great use of remote areas of southern Utah around Lake Powell to suggest an alien world, and Jerry Goldsmith's avant-garde musical score, which has become a landmark, cannot be emphasized more for contributing to the weird atmosphere and eerie mood of the movie. Rarely has a movie score so fit like hand-in-glove than this one.PLANET OF THE APES was a box office smash in 1968, but if ever there was a movie that was more a victim of its own success it's this one. Four sequels, two TV series, numerous novelizations and comic book adventures, and a lamentable remake in 2001 have been spawned by its popularity, most of which has been so inferior in quality to have tarnished the reputation of this classy and intelligent SF film landmark. Luckily the qualities of the film remind viewers again and again of what noted New Yorker movie critic Pauline Kael titled her review of this movie, ""Apes must be remembered, Charlie!""",Planet of the Apes

This one had an ending that'd shock you and (in some cases) would make you fall out of your seat. It has an ending worthy of Rod Serling, speaking of him, he also penned the screenplay for this thrill ride. That's it about the ending, my lips are sealed about everything else about it.The performances are awesome (espically Charlton Heston as astronaut Taylor) you would believe there them, not an actor hoping for a big paycheck.

234,brandinscottlindsey,Thought-Provoking and Fun,8,28 June 2018,"Planet of the Apes is a classic science fiction film. The plot involves a crew of astronauts who crash into a planet dominated by a civilized, talking population of ape-men. In this world, humans cannot speak and are treated like animals while the apes live like humans. The astronauts must survive in a world dominated by xenophobia and totalitarianism. The concept of switching roles is explored when the humans are kept in cages and afforded no rights by animals. On one hand, it shows that the less-intelligent species will always be subjugated, therefore showing a duality with the human world and the ape world. On the other hand, the movie casts a positive light on the humans and their struggles, validating their cause of having rights, despite not being the dominating species. This conflict is shown to be inevitable and natural, but that fighting against it is also justified and expected.Despite a few corny lines of dialogue and a few bits of bad acting, Planet of the Apes is still a great movie. The story will keep you engaged while the overall themes provide thought-provoking and intrigued enjoyment.

235,mcgriswald,Seminal Sci Fi,9,28 January 2007,"Back in the late '90s, I worked with a young guy who felt that rock and roll began and ended with Grunge groups like Nirvana, Alice in Chains, etc. I tried to explain to him that without Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and the Beatles, groups like his favorites wouldn't exist. He scoffed at the notion, and called those groups dated and hokey. He played me a tape of an upcoming band, and we got some tickets to their show. I remarked that they sounded a lot like Zeppelin, and he scoffed at that, too.Midway through the show they started to play a riff that I recognized, and then broke into a rousing cover of a little known Zeppelin tune. After the show I told the kid that they had covered a band he supposedly loathed, only to find out that he really never listened to Led Zeppelin, but took it on faith that they were a ""dinosaur"" band to be scorned.When I read the reviews of younger viewers of this film, I see terms like ""dated"" and referrals to the groundbreaking makeup effects as ""hokey"". You people need to get a grasp of history, the artists of today certainly have, and any current special effects artist stands on the shoulders of those who came before.Planet of the Apes has become a cultural icon, parodied by the likes of Homer Simpson, and the simple fact that it has enjoyed such staying power reveals that it was a very original, groundbreaking film. Like other sci fi of its era, Soylent Green, Silent Running, etc., it has a downbeat ending, and in the case of Planet of the Apes, very shocking for its time.So much of modern film is derivative of Planet of the Apes that it has earned a place as one of the precursors in theme and effect to many more ""sophisticated"" and technologically advanced movies; those viewers who downplay and ignore such great films only end up shortchanging themselves.",Planet of the Apes

Planet of the Apes uses an original idea that could have resulted in a very silly movie, and instead succeeds in creating an intelligent, provocative masterpiece. The writing and directing were superb, and the acting was pretty good most of the time, with flashes of brilliance every now and then. I cannot believe Maurice Evans wasn't nominated for best supporting actor, as I was very impressed with his performance as Dr. Zaius. There is one significant problem with this movie; a logic problem. Taylor was obviously a very intelligent man, and yet he never seemed to wonder why the language of the apes was English. This kind of bothered me through the entire first time I watched the movie, because I figured that it either meant that the movie makers compromised on logic for easier and more practical cinema, or that I had figured out something I wasn't supposed to yet. I didn't mind knowing the mystery, but I did mind the implausibility that Taylor couldn't figure it out til he saw the Statue of Liberty. With all of that being said, I have never seen a movie that did not have a significant flaw, and as far as flaws go, Planet of the Apes was very short on them, and very long on intelligence and excitement.

It combines elements of non-stop action, horror, satire, and tongue-in-cheek humor, with subtle comments on religion, racism, war, and the general arrogance of the human race.  Even the background music is remarkable and unique.I later learned that Planet of the Apes was written by Rod Serling, creator of ""The Twilight Zone"" and master of the ""plot twist"".

What a beautiful films: Planet of the Apes, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Once Upon a Time in the West, Night of the Living Dead, Rosemary's Baby, Romeo and Juliet...Planet of the Apes is simply the best of them all. Science fiction masterpiece. It is almost perfect. I watched this film so many times. I was scared a lot when I was a kid, and now I am impressed every time, again and again.

That means 6 ""Planet of the Apes"" films now, and looks possible - there will be some more in near future.If you have a chance to watch remake of this film: ""Planet of the Apes (2001)"" don't even think about it.

Even though you can understand why the more evil characters act the way they do, you continue to dislike them, which helps fuel your sympathy with the main characters.

245,g_ryder,Deep satire on 'evolution' – you will not like what you find.,10,25 June 2012,"There is a haunting mood in this original make that is missing in the subsequent remakes despite all of the new special effects in the remakes. So one point is already made – more and more technology does not necessarily make art better, rather most of the time technology degrades art and humanity, and at best technology posits a greater and tougher challenge for art and to humanity in general. This is because technology, apart from producing weapons of greater destructive power also entices us with 'appearances' or 'virtual reality' in which we are more likely to get lost and lose sight of our nature and purpose as human beings. Technology is only a tool, a means, not an end in itself; it is a physical tool, just as language is a metaphysical tool for expression and communication.Therefore what may appear as 'evolution' may actually be 'devolution' in another sense.While we humans may 'appear' to have evolved from apes, in some ways we are worse off than apes in our behavior. ""What is called human progress is purely an intellectual affair - not much development, however, is seen on the moral side. It is doubtful whether the methods of modern warfare are preferable to the big stones used for cracking the skulls of fellow-Neanderthals"".(Ludwig Von Bertalanffy) The plot is simple: the crew of a spaceship crash lands on some unknown planet after having left Earth long ago. The planet has life on it but in a reversal of sorts, human like creatures are living in jungles, and hunted and enslaved by apes living in cities. Not only that, but the apes behave very much like modern day humans, and the humans are in all aspects of behavior very much like apes on our very own planet Earth. At a very superficial level it's all quite silly and 'cheesy', if not outrageous or atrocious. It would even seem blasphemous to the typical blockheaded scientist, if not assured of the fact that this is all harmless science fiction that is meant to be amusing for their kids. Let them rest assured that the formerly theory of evolution (which now, of course, according to scientists is an established irrefutable fact) is not being refuted here, only being made fun of. Who says that there is no humor to be found in 'hard as rock', 'facts' of evolution? 'But you are so ugly' says the ape to the human – funny for some, but morbid for others.Yes, we humans will 'seek and ye shall find' (Jesus!), but we will not like what we find, for although we are much more intelligent than other primates (a huge gap or paradox in the 'fact' of evolution), we are even much more destructive proportionately – a fact that we are yet to 'find' and acknowledge, and then also 'find' why and for what that is so – and that is the significance of the last shots of the movie – that it is our destiny to eventually 'find' our true nature, it's significance and to what purpose. Also significant is that like Taylor very, very few humans even want to do so, and even they will not like what they find.",Planet of the Apes

247,edwardlovette,One of the Greatest SciFi classics of all time,10,22 February 2008,I was addicted to this film series back in the mid-seventies. Although Serling wrote the screenplay...he is usually not given full credit for the writing. The end of the movie is a classic Twilight Zone End. Serling loved to use irony in his stories. The music in the movie is also excellent as it was composed by Jerry Goldsmith. My favorite scenes are at the beginning when the astronauts land in the lake in the barren desert and don't yet realize what planet they are on. This movie was filmed on the Fox back lot in the L.A. area...there was a great documentary on the making of this series that came out in 1998 for the 30th anniversary. See if you can find it on amazon.com or this website. It's a fascinating documentary.,Planet of the Apes
248,Raydio,Entertaining but...,7,6 July 2001,"I hadn't watched ""Planet of the Apes"" for a very long while. With the impending release of the 2001 version of the film, I decided to take another look at this old classic.I think anyone who hasn't seen ""Planet of the Apes"", will enjoy this film. The premise of future earth being dominated by ""intelligent"" apes makes for an interesting story. Coupled to this, are some excellent locations, decent performances and a neat ending.If, however you were looking for a scientifically rational, well scripted epic, better look elsewhere. ""Planet of the Apes"" script is filled with more holes than a swiss cheese.I was wondering why anyone would send a character like ""Taylor"" on a space mission. Was he supposed to be an astronaut? a scientist? or just a big boorish bully-boy. As the three scientists explore their new planet home, what do they do when they finally come across the first sign of life (a bush). They dig it up of course! I was also amazed at how nonchalant they all were when they came across the ape totems. I would expect an intelligent person, upon confirming the existence of other intelligent life, would display some appropriate measure of surprise and wonder (even fear).But it was all taken in stride by the characters in this film. Disappointing and unrealistic.There are many more anomalies, which spoilt the experience for me. More often than not, I found myself laughing while watching, and I don't think this was the intended response the director was looking for.""Planet of the Apes"" is a light-weight enjoyable, entertaining film. Just don't think about it too deeply.7/10",Planet of the Apes
249,brtndr,The Greatest Twilight Zone Ever,10,18 August 2012,"Why? Both Planet of the Apes and The Twilight Zone were written by Rod Serling.While most documentaries about the making of the original Planet of the Apes in 68' downplay Rod Serling's script contributions to the final product, for some reason. It's obvious that Rod Serling's original vision for the Planet of the Apes is all over this film.Which is why the Planet of the Apes plays like a two-hour episode of the Twilight Zone, complete with twists of reality to serve as social commentary that includes the classic Rod Serling grandiose shock ending. Rod Serling's trademark form of story telling for his Twilight Zone series.Charlton Heston is perfectly cast as Rod Serling's protagonist astronaut Taylor for 'The Planet of the Apes' Twilight Zone episode. A character that resembles a futuristic Moses who is cynically arrogant, world weary, and idealizes the discovery of something better than a planet dominated by his own species. But, instead of talking to a burning bush for guidance, he blasts off into outer space to discover a idealized alien utopia that he desires to live in.However, what he discovers instead is a planet ruled by a civilization of Apes, with the antagonist human hating Orangutang Dr. Zaius at the top of the Apes societal pecking order. While humans occupy the absolute bottom of Ape society, and treated no better than wild animals to be hunted for sport, killed and experimented on. This forces Taylor to put aside his previous self-loathing cynical world views in a struggle for survival after being captured by the Apes. Taylor may not like the human species very much, but he definitely likes himself enough to prevent being lobotomized by the Apes.Taylor rediscovers what it means to be human during his struggle for survival on his new planet that he can't run away from this time. And is forced to kind of deal with it. However, unfortunately for Taylor, Ape society shares his previous opinion about his own species, and Dr. Zaius wants to eliminate him in order to destroy the last hope of the human race for the purpose of continuing the domination of his own Ape species on the planet. And, is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve that end.I'll let everyone else interpret the meaning of Taylor's horrible discovery at the end of the movie, and what it means for him after his rediscovered sense of humanity after being reduced to a simple nomadic ancient species. Who can talk by the way.Truly, a Rod Serling Classic and only movie. A must see.",Planet of the Apes
250,hereontheoutside,If you expect genius you're dumb,6,6 July 2007,"The image of Charlton Heston kissing a monkey is nearly as priceless as watching Charlton Heston play a Mexican in 'Touch of Evil.' There's something about him that tickles my generation, or maybe it's just me. But watching Heston act in an ensemble of ape-people seems too appropriate. It's about what you expect when you press play. Absurd, ultra- masculine, and the plot line is about ankle deep. Watching the film this week was the first time I'd made an effort to see 'Plant of the Apes,' somehow I feel as though, as a child, watching it on TNT or PBS or whatever channel that plays the same 4 B movies every month, that there was more going on, that the film made sense, but that feeling is now gone. 'Planet of the Apes' just kind of ends at one point, nothing really happens, a lot of tension building for nothing. The famous Statue of Liberty scene (""You Maniacs! You blew it up!) just kind of appears and you wonder, what happened to the rest of the plot? Some people may argue that the plot isn't the point, that it's really a B-movie cloaked as an early blockbuster and that the campy qualities of the film are the point of watching it. OK. I can dig that. Because it's really an awful film. Irredeemably awful. But that's just if you take it seriously, with a grain of salt, it's OK, two and half stars. That's like 5 out of ten, and that's half way to perfect. It's funny. Heston is really just classic Heston, Stallone-funny before steroids were chic. I mean, I guess how else do you take it, he's with a bunch of talking apes, but the film seems to want to take itself more seriously, like it should have some resonating message about America and humanity. But it doesn't, it's all lost and muddled in the mediocre plot that just never really develops. The new version (Tim Burton and Mark Wahlberg) tries to resolve those issues, tie up the plot, give it a message, and in that context it's a more successful film, but it's a worse film. I just don't think America (or possibly the world) is ready to receive a message from talking apes.",Planet of the Apes
251,polos_are_minty,Average,7,12 April 2010,"Planet of the apes was released mere days after 2001: A space odyssey. It is unusual for two such films to be released in close proximity. I think that 2001 has a considerable advantage over this film. I don't by any means think it is a bad film. It has lots of elements and features of a good one, good music, a good story and an interesting plot. What I think brings it down is its lead actor Charlton Heston and its long winded and often irrelevant talking scenes.Obviously films need to use dialogue and conversation between characters to make the film work. The impossibility of this film without dialogue is obvious. However what I found is that many of the scenes were basically Heston sat talking to the camera and whatever other characters appeared on screen. The film made very little use of it's potential for large visual sequences, there were a couple of instances of this, but mainly I thought, in something like planet of the apes, which has so much potential for such scenes, it was lacking. Instead relying mainly on dialogue to push the story forward. There are exceptions to the above, like the child's doll which is found in the cave. When the doll makes the noise, it is a brilliant moment, the look of triumph on the humans faces, compared to that of shock and dismay on the Apes, is a great contrast. The soundtrack is also good, with the music almost always fitting the moment in question on scene, what I will say is that some of it could be quite repetitive, with the same music sequence being used for several scenes. However that barely matters, because I still maintain that the film would of lost some of its effect with no soundtrack.The cinematography is pretty standard, there is nothing paticyualy exciting about any of the shots. The camera Is often stationary, and I did sometimes think that the characters were just talking heads.I feel that my point on dialogue needs expanding. The things I enjoyed about this film were some of the more visual scenes. Whilst I accept that the film does need some dialogue to move the story forward and to explore the society and system, what I don't accept is that dialogue is the best way to do it. There are some films which solely rely on dialogue, but these are of a different sort and on a different sort of scale. With Planet of The Apes, which is essentially about exploration and discovering a new world, I would of expected more to be done with this. Yet what we get is essentially characters sat on screen and talking. This can work as other films I have seen have shown, but really here the talking is dull and unimaginative, with some of the characters spouting some terrible one liners. What I think the film needed was more scenes like the awesome chase scene, when Taylor tries to escape from the Apes custody. This scene is probably one of the best in the film, and all it is is Charlton Hedton running around the screen being pursued by a group of Apes. Yet it is more interesting than a lot of the dialogue which was mainly unimaginative and lacked anything to keep my interest.I want to mention the chase scene, which to me was one of the best bits about the film. Yes it's a tried and tested formula. But I really enjoyed it, I loved how the supposedly inferior human first escapes from the cell and then goes on to allude capture against a vastly larger force for far longer than expected. To me this is more telling than a lot of the dialogue, and is a direct demonstration of one of the ideas of the film which is the superiority of certain classes etc. I can appreciate that other people may find this film more entertaining than I and that they like the commentary on  society that the film offers. I do accept that there is an awful lot of this, but in my eyes it is unsubtle and very obvious. Maybe it's meant to be obvious, but even so I don't think that this does the film any credit and I would rather have a more subtle commentary on our society. As in some ways the way the film is means that this part of the story takes over, and doesn't leave much room for manoeuvring other more minor plot points, and leaves little room for character development, with Charlton Hestons Taylor being an obvious example of this.The ending of the film, if you haven't seen the film is a shocker. As Heston rides along the beach, it leaves you wondering how the film is going to end. It is a good ploy, because the main action sequence has played put, and it feels like everything is coming to a close. In some ways I still expect to see the Horse ride off into the distance, and the credits roll. So when the real ending emerges it is definitely a shock. It is perhaps a cheeky trick by the director, and it is not acted in the best way. But nevertheless it is enjoyable, and that is what really counts7/10",Planet of the Apes
252,Sewaat,Astounding and Intriguing,8,13 July 2017,"Allow me to begin this review by describing a childhood event for you. I was perhaps 10 years old, sitting in an arm chair that was way too big for me. And on the TV screen, was Planet of the Apes. I had not intended to sit down and watch the film in it's entirety, but that was the result all the same. The outcome? 10 year old me was fascinating and intrigued by what she saw. And the film's incredible twist ending, (which I shall not spoil just in case) left a very deep impression upon me and I have never forgotten it since.1968 proved to be an important year for the science fiction genre. In the span of only 12 months, audiences were treated to both 2001: A Space Odyssey and this film. Remarkably, both films feature scenes with realistic ape make-up. Or at the very least, it was realistic for it's time. But let's not compare too much.Younger generations seem to mistaken this film as one of those ""campy"" sci-fi flicks of the 1960's which have that ""so bad it's good"" appeal. Rest assured, Planet of the Apes is not one of those films. Rather, it's a deeply thought-provoking and philosophical study on the human race. But what makes this commentary on humanity so different from other sci-fi films is that the film makers chose to explore it through satire. Apes and men are completely reversed. It is the apes who walk around on two legs and capture humans for their amusement and studies while humans are primal and barbaric creatures who cannot speak. Up is down. Backwards is forwards, etc. What the main protagonist, George Taylor describes as ""a mad house"" is actually quite normal for the ape masses. And it's through such satirical and excellent screen writing that these themes begin to take hold. They are as amusing as they are slightly terrifying.Held under a metaphorical microscope, the aforementioned screenplay is absolutely phenomenal. It's rife with mirthful and stimulating material. I believe it was this quality which had drawn me to the film so easily as a child. It mesmerizes as much as it entertains. However, it also forces us to confront our own wrongdoings. Evoking all sorts of complex questions for us to observe. Is man really so different from animals? Is our first instinct to destroy? Are we actually civil? Or merely pretending to be? You could argue and ponder over such questions all day long, but thankfully the film still provides a good time even without these philosophical musings.As far as performances go, they are also (mostly) excellent. Kim Hunter and Roddy Mcdowall are both able to emote so much through their heavy and intense ape-make up. Every time I watch their scenes, I become more and more impressed. Charleton Heston's best moments emerge when his character is rendered temporarily mute. It has always been my hypothesis that an actor's talent can only be truly tested when he cannot speak, only react. When he does speak, he's simply adequate at best. A very arrogant and ham-fisted performance sometimes gets in the way of what could have been an expertly delivered line of dialogue, but these blunders are far and few between.I consider the original Planet of the Apes to be a definitive sci-fi classic of it's time. And while it is not required to be viewed by anyone who calls themselves a film buff, it is highly recommended that you do. And for good reason.",Planet of the Apes

255,bayhorse,"Is Man Still an Ape?--Or Rather Yet to Become One? Either Way, It's--A Madhouse!--A Madhouse!",10,31 January 2007,"Many insolently skeptical apes, with their religion of biological evolution, and, thus, by extension, anti-social Darwinism, too, might still be cynically, insultingly sneering that they need to see a ""miracle,"" before they'll ever agree to capitulate, and acknowledge the authority of the Lord; in the only real way there is to verify it, through the most rationally sound and morally sober kind of insight, which leaves even them with fundamentally no excuse, particularly if their only real intent is to violate the Golden Rule without ever expecting to have to answer for it. However, by the time their ""miracle"" arrives, which it inevitably shall, and shortly, by now, in this world; they ""might"" just wish it hadn't, as those who insist upon tempting the Lord, and taking it so mockingly, belittlingly, scornfully out, even on the flesh of His servants. Gene Kelly, as E.K. Hornbeck, was so right, from Inherit the Wind, when he said, to Spencer Tracy, as Henry Drummond, ""Face it, Darwin was wrong, man's still an ape!"" But, then, who knows?For, if Charlton Heston is right, it may be a bit more loosely accurate to say he's not quite an apeyet! I could seriously entertain this view a bit more plausibly, were it not for the fact that the words are always just about to come out of my mouth: ""Get even your eyes, indeed, even your very 'thoughts,' off me, you filthy ape!"" In other words, I feel I'm already here, as I continue screaming, at least internally, that ""It's a Madhouse!A Madhouse!"" . . . Seriously, though, is there really any solidly scientific proof that any species transforms into another, rather than their being as separate as the Bible says they were originally created to be (Genesis 1:24-25)? I'm not referring to just evidence, either, with its yet insufficient support of such a possible conclusion. Even God is good at helping provide such misleading ""evidence,"" for the sake of those who insist upon it, even with anything, at bottom, but the most ""neutrally scientific"" of motives (Isaiah 28:9-13) (Matthew 13:10-17); when He likewise helps it to be ""arguable,"" for instance, that even Genesis 1:20-22 supports the notion that all life began in the sea, although never-mind the birds. Moreover, there's no doubt even the way many animals are structured would seem to indicate that, comparatively speaking, either it had to have happened the evolutionary way, or else God designed it deliberately to look as if it did. The atheist will sneer that he doesn't like it, that such would be a stupid idea, of any such ""incompetently bungling"" God. Yet, while the real God is about as fundamentally lovable, and animated by a sense of humor, as George Burns; He can also be as ""difficult,"" when irreverently taunted and mocked into provocation (Romans 1:17-32) (Hebrews 11:6), as Jose Perez, in the Steambath; and, in the words of this enigmatic ""Attendant,"" just as ""whimsically,"" harrowingly unpredictable! If one doesn't like it, that's just tough luck, pal; especially if he truly insists, again, upon getting too inordinately insolent about it! . . . And where's their supposed proof, by the way, that life even spontaneously generates, from dead matter, whatever that is (Hebrews 12:25-28) (II Peter 3:10-12), if only the conditions are right? Indeed, even modern science cannot find any ""solid stuff"" called ""matter,"" which is ""apparently"" created from nothing. Even Job was smarter than most such contemporary ""educators,"" although he had no answer, when God reminded him that he simply hadn't been there, at the Creation; and that even he wasn't nearly as smart as he thought he was (Job, Chapters 38-41), let-alone his ""Christianly comforting friends,"" despite even their most characteristically, perennially eloquent sermons, to this very day (Job 42:7-9), along with their basically Darwinian instincts against Job! The skeptics also emphasize statistical probabilities, and the odds against earth being the only place which contains life. But, again, it has first to be proved, short of actually discovering any extraterrestrial life, that it does, in fact, self-generate, merely given the right physical conditions. . . . And, let's be honest, for that's at least one basic reason why the skeptics really want to find life out therenot just because the prospect is so ""neutrally fascinating."" They feel, at least instinctively, that such a discovery will also help shatter the Biblically ""primitive myth."" They don't want God to exist, and just the fact that one can no less instinctively smell as much, despite all their ""pious"" denials, even and especially to themselves, often enough, should be more than sufficient, all by itself, in confirming this fact, even though it's not the only evidence to support as much. Also, I'm really not trying to attack or ridicule them, the way they characteristically do to their opponents. I understand their pain! I personally experience every instinct in their bodies, unlike the kind of typically religious people who smell no less intolerantly and provocatively foul! For my part, however, it's not a question of what I wish to be true! To the contrary, the notion of everlasting sleep, beyond the grave, is hardly the most discomforting thought, and would be preferable, in one irreducibly ever-relieving sense, to even the possibility of going to a place of everlasting torment, let-alone one too ""eternally blissful"" to imagine! It's simply a question of what I do, in fact, believe to be objectively the case, along with my arguments in support of it, which are hardly being exhausted here!

But this was the best one as it explained the most and had so much going on.They really developed the characters, especially the Apes and essentially gave them a ""Humanity"" the viewer could relate to especially during the conflicted times of the late 60's and early 70's. No Ape movie since then has delved into the Ape characters as well but Tim Burtons version did a decent job.Charlton Heston was a huge coup for them to get to play Taylor but Roddy McDowell kind of stole the show with just his Ape Facial expressions. To be honest, I think he should have won an Oscar for his acting ability in this movie. Many actors can't get their feelings and emotions across normally, but he did it expertly with his Ape Prosthetics on. Not to mention the walking and movements were really good. I think that's one of the reasons this movie and the others in the series were so good, they didn't use masks, they used prosthetics for the faces.For its time period, this movie was truly ahead of its curve. Even today, with CGI, many movies do not look this believable. And then of course, finding the Statue of Liberty on the Beach at the end was probably one of the most stunning endings for a movie back then. It was Pure Shock and Awe.

The film's plot centers around modern day astronaut Taylor (Charlton Heston), who crash-lands on a planet 2000 years into the future...a planet where humans are mute slaves and apes (philosophical orangutans, intelligent chimps and guerilla soldier gorillas) rule! And boy, do they rule! The ape makeup earned an honorary Oscar, and that final twist (scripted by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling of TV's ""Twilight Zone"") still packs a wallop after 30 years! Or should I say 2000 years! Heston was THE sci-fi actor of the late 60's and early 70's (starring in two ""Apes"" films, as well as  ""The Omega Man"", ""Soylent Green"" and ""Earthquake""). The rest of the cast is excellent: Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter as sympathetic chimpanzee doctors Cornelius and Zira; Maurice Evans as the pompous Dr. Zaius; and Linda Harrison (another one-hit wonder) as Taylor's beautiful mute mate Nova (the Eve of their new Millennium). ""Apes"" remains one of my favorite science fiction films ever, and brings back nostalgic memories of my childhood moviegoing experiences. Of its four sequels, ""Escape From The Planet Of The Apes"" (1971, third in the series) is by far the best. My score for this original: 10 out of 10.",Planet of the Apes
258,CarPort1,Give Rod Serling Credit!,8,22 September 2005,"There's not much that hasn't been already been written about Planet of the Apes, but I'll try to bring to light something that's not commonly known and could be of interest. Rod Serling co- wrote the screenplay, along with Michael Wilson, and his involvement has never been given the credit that it's due. Serling has always been known for clever themes infused with social commentary and his trademark ironic-twist endings. What he did with Planet of the Apes is particularly interesting. Basically, he reused a story he had originally screenwritten for an episode of The Twilight Zone entitled ""I Shot an Arrow Into the Air."" Tweaking it a bit and cutting it into halves, it became the beginning and ending of Planet of the Apes. I will not go into detail explaining. Those who are interested can rent the Twilight Zone DVD that contains this episode. It certain areas, it is reproduced almost verbatim. The ""middle half"" of the film is largely Michael Wilson, who basically interpreted the source material constraining it to the budget limitations of the film (the book took place in a futuristic society with flying cars and such, the film takes place in a more primitive society that was more affordable to represent).

The special effects for it's time were really good, compared to today of course, they can't compete but back then, they were good. The story line was so good and the acting of course was great. The costumes, the music everything was going for it. It got you hooked big time and keep you on the edge of your seat, trying to figure out what had happened to this planet. Also intriguing was the chemistry between ""bright eyes"" and the doctor chimp lady, that was really cool also. You found yourself pulling for the leading man and wanting to know what was going to happen all at the same time. Then - the ending - oh wow - that just blew me away. He had traveled forward in time and found out at the end we had blown ourselves all to hell and the apes had taken over. The other sequels were OK but not as good as the first one.

About when Cornelius was so careless, this one skit when Zira was curious of Taylor's intelligence and how he got to the Ape City, Cornelius sighs impatiently. Also, Cornelius and Zira are obviously opposite from each other. I also like Cornelius' face, it makes me laugh.

267,grinten38,Alternative history; the human kind.,7,25 July 2007,"Planet of the Apes teaches us to take a closer look at ourselves. From the opening speech by Heston as astronaut Taylor all throughout the movie, we, as a human species, are simply given a mirror to watch ourselves. The apes simply tell a tale of ignorance and abuse. It's a mixture of ape science and religion, just like the real world, the human world we live in. In that respect this movie has not dated at all.Most mirror aspects are the 'in your face'-type. A more subtle one is right before the famous ending when the apes have dug up artifacts of a previous civilization that was more advanced than theirs. This finding is ridiculed by the apes eldest, the wise one. If anyone has ever looked into the aspects of alternative history 'the human kind', one will find out that the reaction of the apes eldest is typical of the human scientists in our every day lives. Anything contradicting their theories is ridiculed based on beliefs, never on scientific proof. Just because it is more convenient. The same comment is given by the elderly wise ape. He knew and has always known about the old civilizations, he just tried to hide it. Although Planet of the apes is rather slow in the mid section, Heston is great and this movie is thought provoking when you take all aspects into account, not just the obvious ones.

An outstanding cast featuring American and British heavyweights, the best prosthetic make up ever achieved, a gripping, engaging plot, an unbelievably clever script, beautiful sets and set-pieces, and perhaps the greatest twist ending of all time? Those are just a few things that come to mind when I think of this film. This film is first and foremost, a thinking person's movie. Ironically, it was a huge hit with kids because of the fantasy/action aspect of the film. Make no mistake though, this an adult film dealing with serious, philosophical and political issues which are still relevant today. This movie challenges the viewer's perception of reality and man's place in the universe in a way that no other film ever has. Charlton Heston gives by far the most under-appreciated performance of his career, giving us a vital, living, breathing, bleeding character who is impossible not to sympathize with. As Heston wanders further into this brave new world I found myself wishing I was him, despite the horrors he encounters. The viewer feels every ounce of pain that Taylor, played by Heston, feels. It is a cathartic cinematic experience that is not to be missed. Franklin Shaffner, the director, deserves to be counted among the all-time greats for this movie alone, but throw in ""Patton"", which he also directed, and it is clear he was a singular talent. I could honestly go on forever about how thoroughly engrossing this movie is, but I won't here. Just know that this movie represents the best that Hollywood has to offer-intelligent script, superb acting, thrilling action, masterful editing, an unforgettable score and great plot twists. Planet of the Apes is in my top 3 all time films and still holds up incredibly well almost forty years later.",Planet of the Apes

Elements of Orwell's ""Animal Farm"", the Scopes Monkey Trial, the debates on nuclear disarmament, racism, and animal rights. The film is actually very deep intellectually even if on the surface it seems unintentionally funny at times.  (Warning, spoiler ahead.)

274,cybertigger1,One of my top 10 favorites,9,20 July 2006,"I was born in 1966, so I didn't really become aware of the Planet of the Apes franchise until I was perhaps 7 or 8, about 5 years after the original movie premiered. However, it was still a real cultural phenomena around that time, and there were lots of toys, comic books, coloring books, sticker books, etc. etc. which I collected hungrily. And all this without having ever seen an Apes movie in the theater, even the last couple, Conquest and Battle. I saw the entire series on television. Even so, ""Apes"" was the centerpiece of my fantasy life as a young child, until Star Wars came along to replace it.The first film definitely remains the best. Plenty of people have had their say on it already and I really don't have anything to add. I do want to say, however, that I disagree with those who automatically trash the sequels. IMO all of them were very well done and quite thought-provoking, if a bit heavy-handed on the social commentary at times.One way in which the films are seriously dated, however, is that they present the Chimpanzees as the pacifists and the Gorillas as the aggressive, warlike types. Since then, of course, researchers have shown that Chimpanzees are far more aggressive and violent than Gorillas. (And chimpanzees are also more closely related to man than gorillas.) SPOILER: One thing I think lots of fans of the series have missed is that the character of Caesar is a wild card. He's a savior, a Christ figure. I've seen many post Battle for the Planet of the Apes timelines that lead to essentially the same future Taylor encounters in the year 3950.But Caesar's ""purpose"" is to be a savior. In the original history, it is the Gorilla, Aldo, who first speaks and then leads the Apes in rebellion against their human oppressors. In ""Battle,"" Aldo is subordinate to Caesar, and Caesar kills him at the end of the movie. By bringing Apes and Humans together as equals (whereas Aldo probably made them slaves and humiliated them, then drove them out), Caesar introduces an element of hope by, at the end of the film, bringing Apes and Humans together as equals. The threat of the Earth's destruction via the Alpha-Omega Bomb remains, but there is also the possibility that Caesar's presence has introduced a subtle change that will alter the course of the future.",Planet of the Apes

Not at all. It just makes it a bit of a guilty pleasure for some. The film is visually quite good, from the excellent make-up for the apes to their stony rock town to the epic ending which sadly has probably been spoiled for all viewers as it has been engraved into the cultural lexicon. It's a definite piece of Americana at it's best with some classic lines and very memorable characters. If you had too see only one movie that a friend might say ""it sounds pretty dumb"" from the title alone. This is the one to see.

No other film I'd seen up to that point so sustained suspension of disbelief as this one did. The actors in ape make-up seemed utterly real, and after the conclusion I left the theatre speechless.  The movie gripped my imagination and has never let go.  I'm now almost forty-one and it's still my favorite movie.  That's not to say I think it's perfect.  The story has plot holes and the make-up, once so convincing, now looks somewhat primative.  Still the movie holds up. It is extremely well-directed (this film put Franklin J. Schaffner on the map), the Panavision photography of Leon Shamroy is excellent, the performances of the actors in ape make-up is great (I don't think Roddy McDowall ever gave a better performance as an adult), the costumes deserved their Oscar nomination as did Jerry Goldsmith's landmark score.  (In fact, Goldsmith's score is now probably the film's best element.  Few other scores fit a film as well as this one does.  The music soundtrack album has never not been in release on records, tape and now CD.) Even Charlton Heston is better than average here.  Some claim he overacts, but I think he's just about perfect, esp. since his being the star is one of the movie's biggest jokes.  If you can, rent this film in its THX transfer, and letterboxed since this is one of the best examples of what a Panavision film should look like, and Goldsmith's score is in stereo surround.  I can't wait for it to come to DVD.  I just wish 20th Century Fox didn't put the image of the 'surprise' ending on the box.  And finally a word of warning, don't bother with the sequels -- none are as good as the first and at least two, esp. the last, are down right terrible.  But if you must, ""Escape From The Planet of the Apes"" is the best.  ""Planet of the Apes"" is such a great piece of Sci-Fi political and social allegory that a remake is on the way for 2001.

Taken for what it is it's one of the better science fiction films Hollywood's ever done.  I don't think it should be knocked for being thought-provoking.

It makes me wonder why they polluted the big screen with an unnecessary remake with an ending, while closer to the ending of the book, misses the point the book was making and was thus pointless.

It has to do with the scene right after the famous 'take your filthy paws off me' sequence, where Taylor is talking to Nova. A number of gorillas enter the holding area where Taylor is being held. Julius turns a fire hose on Taylor, who is in the cage he shares with Nova, enabling a couple of other gorillas to enter the cage and remove Nova. She ends up in another cage. The point/question is this: might this not be a reference to 'Bull' Conner turning fire hoses on Civil Rights protesters in (I believe it was) Selma, Alabama, in what was then recent history? If so, this becomes another social comment in a movie which does a fine job of concealing social commentary in the context of one of the finest science-fiction stories ever thought of. This puts this series of these movies on an approximate par with 'Star Trek', the original series of which was going through it's first run at that time, and which also buried social commentary inside of it's stories. Something struck me as funny when I read the trivia section. I saw there how Roddy McDowell liked to drive home with his makeup on, evoking reaction from various motorists who would notice what appeared to be a chimpanzee driving a car. I could just picture the situation if he had been pulled over by one of LA's finest for some infraction or other. The cop steps up to the side of the vehicle to request to see the driver's license, registration, and proof of insurance coverage, and is greeted by what seems to be a chimpanzee operating a four wheeled motorized vehicle on a public road (or highway) in the State of California.

I want to say that taste is not only likes and dislikes, but how those likes and dislikes measure both individually and with groups through time. This film has both helped define my taste in film, and on some soulful level defined me. I've tried to give it consideration through many years and even though many other films have cultural and personal significance, Planet of the Apes is part of me.
I can say that because I remember from when I first saw it, on CBS when it premiered all those years ago it caught me like on of the humans hunted by the gorillas in the cornfield. I remember the perfection of the shock as Taylor and his comrades ran for their respective lives. I've watched the film more times than I can remember, and I still marvel at the total and complete transition that happened in those few minutes film.
The whole work is sublime. The opening with Taylor talking to computer making a record of hopes before he goes of to join his crew mates in suspended animation really doesn't get the credit it deserves for transporting the viewer into a different world. I understand the equally high praise that I've heard over the years for how outer space sequence with the colorful light imagery is more clever than effects that many other films have tried to capture with greater grandeur and less impact. I say foul, because most of the competition lacked Jerry Goldsmith's brilliant score. As the opening credits roll, I feel transformed from being a boy under ten in a room with family watching this for the first time to an adult who has seen so much. I still need to come back.After the credits we do another transition.",Planet of the Apes

287,wicket177,Great Classic,8,4 March 2002,"I started liking movies a long time ago, but I never really wanted to sit through old movies (by old im talking 60's. Hey, im only 18).  Planet of the Apes was the first movie from this time period that I actually watched and I loved it.  For some reason, after I watched PotA, I started watching a whole bunch of movies from the 60's and now they are some of my favorites.  I already knew the ending... I mean, its on the damn cover of the dvd box. But I still thought that it was excellent.  The beginning crash was cheezy, but I think that the makeup and costumes were awesome (for the time period especially).  Anyways, great movie, classic ending, awful sequel... Go rent it but don't look on the case if you don't know how it ends.

288,Sparse,"An Intelligent, Brutally Profound Satire",10,3 July 2017,"Sometimes there's so much to say about a film that only blanks can be drawn in the unrelenting breathlessness of racing thoughts. Simultaneously entertaining and intellectually enthralling, this film bleeds unforgiving satire with every frame. Planet of the Apes is a cinematic landmark, and it obsesses my entirety.I'm having to choose my words here with great care. There's so much to write about, and organizing my thoughts to do this movie justice is a challenging task for me. Planet of the Apes has shaped who I am more so than any other film I've seen, and while I can't promise the same profundity of experience to every viewer, the allegorical implications contained within this text persist with potency. Science fiction is arguably the genre best equipped to reflect upon humanity, and this feature harnesses this medium masterfully. This is also by far the most allegorically dense film I've ever encountered: unveiling ruthless commentary on race, religion, philosophy, and politics, in often blunt but always meaningful fashion. Though sure to challenge some audiences in ways that might upset them, I find the content of this film to be of great importance.It may on occasion be cited as the original summer blockbuster, but more importantly, this film is intellectually enthralling. By reflecting humanity through a society of apes, we're similar enough, yet simultaneously given enough distance to internalize the film's intricately woven analogies. That being said, strong direction by Franklin J. Schaffner ensures a solidly entertaining experience, with exciting action sequences and and some appealing cinematography. Seeing as how this film is strongest in its intellect however, one should really look to its writing.Though it's been some time since I've read Pierre Boulle's ""La planète des singes"" (a.k.a. Monkey Planet), I have to give it credit for providing such a rich foundation for this monumental production. The film however, takes the concept even further. If this movie ever felt like a really good, feature-length episode of The Twilight Zone, that's because it basically is--the initial draft that eventually became the film was written by Rod Serling himself, hence the defining twist at the end. The politically charged final product however was by none other than Michael Wilson (The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence in Arabia).A degree of Planet of the Apes' politicality can be attributed to some of Wilson's background. During the McCarthyism scare, a number of Hollywood screenwriters were accused of being ""communists"" and were blacklisted from the industry. Wilson was forced to flee to France, and proceeded (as many others did) to write under a separate alias or go wholly uncredited. Upon release, all screen credit for Planet of the Apes went to Pierre Boulle, and Wilson finally received writing credit for his work post- mortem in 1984. Though tragic, it implies that his experience with being wronged by a political system in-part provided a drive for creating this brutally satiric screenplay. Col. George Taylor is worthy of a more in-depth character analysis, as a study on existentialism, and an experiment on the ego. Consider that this ""upside down world"" is intentionally perceived by a white male, now stripped of his rights and part of a silenced minority. The social structure of the apes actually provides some stunning race/class commentary, with the darkest of gorillas confined to menial working-class roles whilst the lightest of orangutans held societal power, often in the form of political or religious leadership. This is used to reflect the dangers oligarchical and theocratic societies. This class structure also outlines an overall political dichotomy, revealing its relationship with class, race, and how it affects our ability to perceive. There is also depiction of bigotry, religion, and the war on science, most notably the trial scene that reflects the Scopes Monkey Trial. By repeating fallacious arguments through the medium of non-human characters, the audience is given perspective and may unwittingly realize their own, human flaws.Charlton Heston deviates slightly from his dignified, heroic typecast, now favoring a character stripped of some of their dignity, but is otherwise just playing himself: Charlton Heston. Kim Hunter as Zira and Roddy McDowall as Cornelius are endearing, and Maurice Evans is unsettling and commanding as Dr. Zaius. What's impressive about the actors who portrayed the apes is that they had to develop acting methods that would bleed through the prosthetics, and they succeed impressively well, exhibiting their spectacular but often under-appreciated talent.The prosthetic ape makeup by John Chambers is simply revolutionary. The apes in this feature are completely believable evolved counterparts to the great apes we see today, and it was no easy feat. The makeup took four months for Chambers to develop, and then several more hours to apply everyday before filming. The work on this level actually broke records and set a new standard for ape costumes in movies, mirroring the reboot franchise's later breakthroughs in motion capture technology. Planet of the Apes is an innovative franchise at its core, and will likely continue to innovate until the apes take over.The score by Jerry Goldsmith is avant-garde and enthrallingly bizarre. Though not crafted with the same kind of narrative intelligence that the best film music has to offer, it goes above and beyond when creating textures that are innovative, diverse, and contribute to a memorable and unique atmosphere. Goldsmith's work here is among the best the franchise has to offer.Above all this film is a study on perspective, and can say more about humans using apes than most films can say by using humans. Planet of the Apes is as meaty as sci- fi comes, and is quintessential viewing for sci-fi fans. It's also pretty damn quotable. Score: 10/10",Planet of the Apes
289,gomi28,"Not just good, better than most movies since.",9,14 July 2004,"I am glad to see this is in the top 250.  It made it there not because it is a cult classic, infact I think it is not a cult classic style of movie. It is not at all cheesy like I was expecting.  Yes there are a few things in there that date the movie, but this is well ahead of it's time.  If it were not for ""Fight Club"" I would not have seen it. (Cornelius, Rupert, etc. names that Ed Norton uses as aliases are names from this movie). 
This movie talks about religion, culture, censorship, and calusness in a way that makes you think about how we might have been manipulated growing up in the cold war by our churches, schools, and government.Now that I have seen this I would like to see some of the TV shows. I was too young to remember anything other than apes fighting humans back then.  I hope the remake with Marky Mark was 1/2 as good as this was (I liked the remake of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" more than I thought, it was better the the old sequels by far, so I have hope for newer remakes.)I truely recomend this to anyone that likes movies that make you think, as well as those that just like action mixed with drama.

Charlton Heston, for my money is your quintessential leading man, and he needs to be, as for most of the film he is the only human we see speaking . As youve probably already read,he has some fantastic lines.""Get your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape""- his first words to his ape captors. The film also poses questions on ethics,religion and mans ability for self destruction,which as most of you will know becomes evident in the final breathtaking scene. If i have one complaint about the film its the questions it leaves unanswered.Just how did the apes and man swap places?, Was ape city the only inhabited place on the planet? and how did man lose the power of speech?.The four sequels which this film spawned are in my opinion very poor and look extremely dated compared to this masterpiece.I look forward to Tim Burtons update later this year, but although it will obviously have better make up and FX i cant see it matching this 1968 original.9 out of 10",Planet of the Apes
291,sophie_lou21,Of Monkeys and Men,10,12 November 2005,"In recent years sci-fi have been filled with flashing lights, high-budget CGI effects and ridiculous stunts like in THE MATRIX and I, ROBOT. If you don't like one sci-fi film you're unlikely to like any as they're all the same. However, my dad took down PLANET OF THE APES from our video shelf. Unlike most sci-fi films it was made in a time that had to deal without CGI and relied completely on the break through movie make-up as well as providing what people have voted time and time again ""The Greatest Film Ending"". PLANET OF THE APES has a memorable cast, simple plot and it keeps your attention even as the credits are rolling at the end. Based on Pierre Boulle's lesser novel (La Planète des singes AKA Monkey Planet) tells of an astronaut landing on a distant planet and discovering that man's role as the superior life form has been reversed with the apes. The film has many needed changes to it to make it more watch-able and tap into the true fears at the time the film was made. In 1968, everyone lived in fear of an atomic bomb attack and PLANET OF THE APES truly taps into that fear, for reasons I will not reveal but it is understandable why the story was so popular at the time and why it shocked everyone.PLANET OF THE APES tells the story of George Taylor (Charlton Heston), when he and his doomed astronaut friends find themselves stranded on a distant planet. It seems to be inhospitable with no life. However, after travelling throughout the place, which is famously referred to as ""The Forbidden Zone"", discover plenty of life including ape like humans and human like apes. Taylor is shot in the neck rendering him unable to speak. Treated as a wounded animal he is taken to a human-ape study lab where he meets Zira (Kim Hunter), a sympathetic and friendly chimpanzee. She almost straight away notices that Taylor's intelligence goes far beyond that of any other human, and she encourages him to speak. However, orangutan leader Dr Zaius sneers on Zira's and her fiancé Cornelius' (Roddy McDowall) belief in any human intelligence, and won't listen to reason. Despite Cornelius' skeptical feelings towards Taylor, he agrees to help prove his intelligence which is proved once he finally says his famous line: ""Take your stinking paws of me you damn dirty ape!"" Heston is anything other then a likable character. Unlike Ulysse Merou in the novel Taylor is slightly moody, but a likable character who values his friendship with Zira and Cornelius. He represents what humans truly are that is self-centered, violent and dangerous. Though on stage he is reportedly (according to Laurence Olivier) truly a talented actor, on screen and in PLANET OF THE APES, Heston basically turned up and played himself. Nonetheless the character of Taylor works as you either love him or you hate him. The rebel Taylor is no different from the other pushy characters Heston has played over the years. With his tough, physical god-like body you suppose that in a film where the apes are pushing us humans about because we're basically behaving like apes he is just what the doctor ordered.Of course we all know that it's the two lovable chimps Zira and Cornelius that we remember the most in the PLANET OF THE APES films for their charm and humor they bring to the story. Hunter's portrayal of Zira was a masterpiece on its own, giving one of the most powerful performances. It's fair to say that Zira is the strongest and most developed character in the film. Indeed she is the only ape that Taylor actually likes! With her wit and admirable sense of humor it's not surprising that most people asked who their favorite character is reply ""Zira"". Hunter manages to make Zira what she was meant to be, more human then ape. In fact, she's more human than most of the beautiful female actresses of the 60's films. Despite the fact she looks as ugly as hell in her ape make-up the charm still shines through.Of course, if you don't love the intelligent and cool Zira, you always have intelligent and nerdy Cornelius. McDowell, next to Heston, is the most celebrated male actor in the films as he comes over as the nerd of the rebel gang that you just want to hug. In the film, Taylor seems to have a love-hate rivalry with Cornelius as they constantly challenge each other like full-blooded males do no matter how civilized. A good example of this is when Zira allows Taylor to kiss her on the lips as a goodbye and Cornelius makes his jealousy clear. However Taylor sticks up for him against Zaius, which shows not as much friendship as understanding. McDowell is an irreplaceable member of the cast who is near impossible to live up to.PLANET OF THE APES is a mark in cinema history, famous for these talented artists, gripping story and an amazing ending that shocks you, scares you, breaks you and brings you to tears with the realization that you'll never truly experience a film like this again. Anyone who is anyone owes it to himself or herself to watch this film and experience the feeling. Even people who dislike sci-fi are likely to enjoy this. A film that truly did break STAR WARS and challenged it like no other film ever could. PLANET OF THE APES will live on in all of us. It will go on forever, find its way to younger audiences and will win them over just it won over us.",Planet of the Apes
292,dzsoro,Stellar sci-fi horror with a transcendent leading Man in Heston.,10,5 May 2021,"""Take your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty ape!"" ~ Stellar sci-fi horror with a transcendent leading Man in Heston. An eerie look into a twilight future, a film that will make you think and smile and despair all at once. The far future rise of the apes and the apocalypse of Man on Earth make for bleakly ill-defined musings upon present pitfalls. Proverbial 'Last Man' Taylor is the perfect representation of the human species, as we know them / as the ruling class apes fear them / as the underclass apes aspire to understand them - smart, dangerous, cavalier, relentless. Drifting through the cosmos, in firm command of his hypersleep crew and interstellar machines - Taylor's ego is ""squashed"", his words honied and profound; naked in the brush and on the run from an alien foe - he is methodical yet feral, patient with perforce manipulation and potential murder. He is the paragon ""glorious paradox"" that alights the 1960s hope for a true Space Age with his competent yet cynical command, still making war and still on the run from facing Himself. Taylor faces his pair of destinies with that time-honored duality: one with stoic, even eager, embrace {that of being alone and stranded in a faraway land}, and the other, his truer fate, with hysterical, useless lamentation. ~ ""You Maniacs!

Though his total trip time has only been eighteen months, nearly two millenniums have passed back on Earth as a result of a relativity-type effect. He quickly discovers that he is not alone on this alien world, and that the evolutionary ladder has been turned upside down, with mute humans being hunted by talking apes. After surviving a hunter's bullet, Taylor is taken into Ape City where he is caged like an animal and the subject of 'animal psychology' experiments. Fortunately, Taylor is befriended by Nova, a mute but fetching human woman, and catches the attention of chimpanzee scientist Dr. Zira and her archaeologist fiancé Cornelius. Zira and Cornelius are shocked to discover that Taylor is unlike any other human they have seen, possessing both intelligence and the power of speech. Despite attempts by Dr. Zaius, the head of the Ape Assembly, to protect the status quo by having him destroyed, Taylor escapes, and rides off into the sunset with Nova. It is here that the film makes its earth-shattering and sobering revelation-- ""SPOILER ALERT!"" The cynical, misanthropic astronaut finds the upper half of the Statue of Liberty on a deserted beach, proof that he had returned to Earth and the 'upside-down' world he found was a result of man's own folly.Taking into consideration the cultural context in the film was made, it is not surprising the number of subtle allegories that can be found in ""Planet of the Apes"".

The film continues to deliver concept after concept in true science fiction style, and creates a chilling world almost parallel to our own. The films ideas about religion, war and the future of the human race are as pertinent today as they were in the dark Cold War era of the film's creation - and as they have been since the dawn of history. The film delivers biting criticism of man's refusal to expand his horizons and break free from senseless dogma and tradition; his blunt refusal to listen to reason, his utter complacency. Concepts aside, the film features an inspired performance by Charlton Heston, who delivers every line with flawless style. His portrayal of 'Taylor' the man captured and then befriended by Simian 'animal psychologists' who experiment on the brains of humans (genius!), is a performance which could make even the worst plot and dialogue intensely watchable. Lines like ""GET YOUR STINKING PAWS OFF OF ME YOU DAMN DIRTY APE!!"" can never be repeated with such class. On the whole this film is absolutely excellent in every sense of the word, a true masterpiece.

I watched it many years ago, and I though that it was a wonderful experience in imagination, a science fiction masterpiece. It was before ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Lord of the Rings"". Then, some months ago, I watched it again and had the same feelings. It's like if the movie itself  it's storyline, production values and characters  was in a time capsule, save from the present, protected against imitations and spoofs like the new ""Planet of the Apes"" (2001) or The Simpson's ""Stop the Planet of the Apes!"". What is the source of its power? The answer, I think, is the absence of special effects and the ""realism"" of the story. We have a travel to the future, some apocalyptic sets and talking chimps - so, we don't need laser guns or apes jumping like Keanu Reeves in ""Matrix"". The upside-down world visited by Charlton Heston is absurd enough, and CGI effects (if they were available in 1968) would be too much. It's a science fiction oriented for the adult audiences, what explains the sober tone of the acting and the film-making. The script also delivers a powerful story and an eerie climax, in the school of H. G. Wells and Philip K. Dick novels  and the simian establishment, with it's medieval mentality and cold rationalism, represents a real threat to the astronaut/hero Colonel Taylor (a sense of danger totally missed on Tim Burton's remake). In the conclusion of the film, there's no ape army fighting human warriors  but a lonely man discovering the ultimate true about our destiny, the fate of our species. Even in these days, when the nuclear nightmare is under control, it's a blasting, impressive view of the future. In movies like ""Planet of the Apes"", the visual aspects are always relevant. POTA was certainly ahead of its time: the tools used on the film works SO WELL (the ape makeup is still very impressive, along with the sets and costumes) that is easy to buy its premise. The monkeys are very real in their leather clothes, and one can imagine that, if the evolution had been reverse, they would look like that. It's an amazing exercise in imagination.

I really admired this movie for 3 extremely innovative features: 1> The use of time dilation to achieve a sort-of time travel (although uni-directional and irreversible) 2> Showing us the mirror on how cruelly, humiliatingly and impatiently we treat our animals; how we find other creatures, esp monkeys, ugly and repulsive. And making a mockery of the creationists, that too from another species' perspective. 3> Evolution is old, but de-evolution really gave me the kick!I don't remember the name, but when I was little I read a poem in school in which all creatures (both intelligent and otherwise) firmly believe that God is one of their own, and He created them in His likeness.

310,sitindc,Awesome from start to finish,10,20 April 2017,"This is the best of all the Planet of the Apes films. For those who are older students of film like myself...we know just how amazing/ground- breaking the music, cinematography, writing and make-up were in this film. Sorry to sound cliché but Director Franklin J. Schaffner was a true visionary. Of course, two years after ""Planet,"" Schaffner won the Academy award as best director for the movie Patton. Everything from the cinematography to the cynical nature of Col. Taylor were captured perfectly.

311,Thornstr,Too many plot holes,6,4 January 2015,"This movie has NOT aged well. I can't get over the fact that Taylor doesn't realize it's earth until the end, although the apes speaks English, rides horses etc. That's just too big of a plot hole. And the apes seem too primitive to have rifles, that is a product of an industrialized civilization. And the woman, she has perfectly shampooed hair, make-up, no hair on her body.. and of course they chose an actress for the role who was Miss Berlin and a model :) Add some racist undertones to it, and it's just too stupid. It's an interesting idea for a movie, but too sloppily executed.No, avoid this movie, read the book instead. This is Hollywood dumbing things down.",Planet of the Apes

In the other hand, some awful actings by other members of the cast (the old apes don't know another way of giving their lines but shouting all the time), a lot of plot holes and several very long, slow and completely unnecessary scenes. Probably this is the main problem: continuous discussions and discussions about nonsense (and framed by scenes of Heston being beaten by the monkeys... and being beaten again... and being beaten again...)Surely, this is an artwork in comparison to Burton's remake. But that is like saying Keanu Reeves acts fine if you compare him to Bon Jovi.

Well, stuff them! Planet Of The Apes is awesome, and i'm going to tell you why.Let me start off with the acting. The acting in this film is great! The way they were able to develop the ape's characters personalities through those rubber masks is amazing! Charlton Heston is fantastic as the main character, and Nova was a surprisingly good actor!Most people only see pictures of the ape masks and think: FAKE! THAT MOVIE SUCKS!!!!! Well, c'mon, it doesn't look that bad! Maybe if it was made today people would have the rights to laugh at it, but, the film was made 45 years ago! CGI didn't exist yet! SO DON""T JUDGE THIS FILM ON ITS EFFECTS!!!Now we've gone over the acting and effects, we can talk about the actual film. Planet Of The Apes is great. what more is there to say? It has an important message and is very deep, it talks about heavy subject matters such as evolution and war, and its funny, but stays serious. I'm not going to spoil anything, but that ending!

317,minos_,A culture shock in more than one way.,10,3 January 2017,"This masterpiece of science fiction turns many things upside down, not only in its premise of apes taking the place of humans, but also in a kind of movie-making that will be foreign to anyone shying away from movies this old. Thankfully, Planet of the Apes pulls off this older style so exceptionally well, it can be used as a shining example of how to tell a story.The pace is slow, the characters clearly traverse a single linear path, a single scenario, with many long shots establishing their condition. Direct spoken exposition is often avoided, instead all dialogue focuses on the philosophical message of the movie. Music is almost nonexistent throughout long parts of the movie, nothing is dramatized. Fights are scrappy, chase scenes are awkward. In fact, characters behave so believable and the setting as well as tone are so dry and calm, there is a certain documentary style to the movie, which fits its message immensely.Before i watched this movie, i was already spoiled the ending, something i thought would kill a lot of buzz throughout the movie. I found however, that the outcome is hinted at very clearly throughout the movie and not difficult to figure out. If anything, that only helps outline the bleak reality of the main character. So much so that i believe the movie could have even done without the (iconic) last shot. The message of this movie is deep hitting. The story does not conclude, the romance does not conclude, the drama does not conclude: it never could. All focus lies on the grander image.Ultimately, a mans journey through a foreign culture is just a tool for this epic study of humankind. An outstanding achievement in science fiction, film and story-telling.",Planet of the Apes
318,FuriousGiorge,"A good, allegorical Sci-Fi",8,30 January 2000,"This might just be the easiest movie ever to spoof, thanks to Chuck Heston's classic over-acting in a few key scenes, especially the last.  The issues it confronts however, like most issues which affected the last half of the 60's, continue to have much relevance today.  Science versus religion, youth versus the Establishment, racial bigotry and hatred.  I think it's also fair to say that the writers of the movie have left the resolution of these issues in the movie fairly ambiguous, instead of forcing their own views into the movie's plot.  Perhaps the biggest reason to NOT watch this movie is that it is filled with so many plot holes.  Maybe some of the stuff is explained in the sequels but I'll be damned if I'm gonna watch those.  How could Chuck not figure out where he was?  The apes spoke ENGLISH for Christ's sake!  I still wonder, too, where exactly the human space ship was expected to end up.  What, they just sent a ship into the void of space hoping that it would end up on a planet?  Although those two just scratch the surface of a deeply-flawed plot, this movie is still worth watching. It is not the experience visually that 2001 is, but for those who don't have the patience for Kubrick's (sometimes) painfully long scenes, try this movie instead.

Charlton Heston does an amazing job acting out the lost astronaut (Taylor). Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter also do very good jobs with their characters that will set the tone for the rest of the series. I came in to watching this with low expectations, because like so many of my friends my age (18) they believe this to be a terrible movie that goes into an even worse series, but I was HUGELY surprised to find that this movie kept my attention the whole way through! Not only that but it had enough action and dramatization to keep my attention every step of the way. It also qualifies as a great ""thinker"" movie and ends in a very thoughtful/pessimistic way that works perfectly for the movie...compared to the remake (planet of the apes 2001). I even caught myself thinking about it later in the day. Once its all said and done I found myself wanting the movie to continue!

Through out the entire movie the protagonist tries to escape the planet and return to Earth, only to find this is the planet Earth, he has been home the whole time, but the home is no longer what it was...It's a thought provoking perspective to see how it's like humans been treated the same way that humans treat animals in the real life. The ending comes jaw dropping, mind blowing, the most stunning movie ending of all time. You can find ground shifting twists in The Sixth Sense or Shutter Island, but not to match the profoundness of the ending in the Planet of the Apes, as it only to reveal the entire human civilization had been long gone, re-evolution had taken place. It makes you to look into the tales of lost continent of Lemuria and Atlantis, mysteries like Sumerians cylinder seals and Yonaguni giant steps, space ship sightings, other dimension channelings, past life memories documentaries, out of body experiences reports... and to question what is THIS Planet of Earth we have been on.The Planet of the Apes 1968 had spawned 4 sequels, 2 TV series, inspired remakes in 2001, Rise of the Planet of the Apes 2011 and recent release Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. It's very touching to see how this Planet of the Apes original had influenced the filmmakers of generations that followed and it's legacy continues for decades and on going... Personally speaking, i saw Planet of the Apes at age of 10, only to realize 10 years later it is the most import movie of my life. Even before i consciously knew, it had opened my door to see more movies for illuminations, and to learn filmmaking to create and transcend of what's in me.

Excellent commentary on religion and just about everything else. I strongly recommend to anyone who has not seen it.

I believe it explores in detail the debate between God and evolution, but from a different point of view... what if God created apes to be superior to man or did apes evolve from man? I can see Rod Serling's technique by twisting reality, like he does in ""The Twilight Zone"". As a scientist and atheist, I do believe in evolution and can respect the moral of this story. However, I do not believe that man can evolve back into apes, but instead into a more intelligent and profound species. This brings me to my next point. As I am a true fan of time travel, I noticed that this film had a hint of ""The Time Machine"" where the future has two species. The jungle humans are like the Eloi and the apes are like the Morlocks, both having the same characteristics. Over the years in both of these films, man has evolved into two separate species. I do not believe this will happen, but more separate races, as we already have many. Overall, this movie was excellent.RJ",Planet of the Apes
327,genebathurst,Brilliant & disturbing sci-fi social satire that'll totally freak you out if you watch it when you're seven,10,30 March 2019,"""Somewhere out there there has to be something better than man."" - Taylor (Charlton Heston)The film opens in the cockpit of a spacecraft, the ultimate antiseptic, finely controlled environment. This is human civilization at its peak. All of the crew are asleep, in cryogenic stasis, save Taylor, the misanthropic captain played by Charlton Heston. He's entering a log, Captain Kirk style, but being considerably more introspective because he's got time to kill and themes to advance:""Space is boundless. It squashes a man's ego. I feel lonely. That's about it. Tell me though. Does man that marvel of the universe that glorious paradox who sent me to the stars still make war against his brother? Keep his neighbor's children starving?""That's the set up. High tech ship soaring through the stars, mankind's best aboard, pondering the meaning of life. Mankind is on top and in charge.All is right with the universe.Then the rug gets yanked out and we enter free fall.They didn't have enough money to show the ship crash landing, so they shot it from the ship's POV, using footage taken by an airplane. The camera spins and yaws, then careens down into a lake, pulling the viewer along with it.It's a stunning, delirious sequence, born of necessity, but it works fabulously, establishing an eerie, artsy vibe, thanks to the fantastic cinematography, the magnificence of the Arizona desert, and the unnerving score.If it weren't for the title, the last thing you'd expect is for the astronauts to run into a bunch of talking gorillas. It starts out posing as Hard SF.Heston and two bright-eyed, bushy-tailed comrades, Landon and Dodge, escape their sinking spacecraft, but the fourth member of their expedition, a woman who would be the new eve, dies before landing due to a malfunction in her cryotube.The barren Arizona desert makes for a wonderful alien world, lifeless from horizon to horizon. The cast is framed against the vast landscape, without a single plant to be seen.Eventually the stranded astronauts find a weed, which fills the crew with hope, despite Taylor razzing them every step of the way. Soon the wastes give way to lush forest and grassland. They find a pool right out of Doctor Doolittle and jump in, only to have their clothes and equipment mysteriously stolen before they can get out.They encounter a herd of mute humans, who have been reduced to the level of animal intelligence.Heston figures they'll be running the place in short order.His ambitions are quickly dashed as they hear hunting horns sound.Because these human beings are being hunted like animals. The pursuers are at first unseen. We catch glimpses of poles thrashing the cornfield, rifles firing, horses charging. Humans are flushed like birds, herded like cattle, shot like dogs.Finally Heston catches sight of the horsemen and realizes... they're apes!One of the astronauts is killed, a second captured, and Heston wounded in the throat.As the hunt concludes, trophy photos taken over their corpses. By making apes the oppressors, Serling set into very sharp relief man's barbarity to man, and comments on racism and colonialism.Granted, it's pretty obvious what planet this is, as the apes speak perfect English. There was some talk of having the apes speak a kind of gibberish at first, which becomes intelligible (English) as Heston picks up the local language. But this was abandoned as being too complicated for audiences of the time.Heston is injured and separated from his friends, and gets thrown into the upside down world of ape politics. It's a simplified mirror of our own world, of course, with ape society broken up into three castes: orangutans are authority figures, gorillas are soldiers and workers (presumably farmers as well), and chimpanzees are the middle class and ineffectual intellectuals.This class based view of society fits with Wilson's Marxist leanings, and actually enriches the picture, adding further depth to the social messages and sharp witted satire.In fact, the ape actors so took to their race / class based roles that they all ate by group: gorilla with gorilla, chimp with chimp, orangutan with orangutan.Taylor is paraded around on a leash, threatened with castration and lobotomy, and kept in a cage. The world is now fully inverted: privileged astronaut and American hero Taylor is now a mere animal. From top to bottom in under thirty minutes.Due to his throat injury, Taylor cannot speak, and his attempts to try are mocked by apes as mere mimicry.For such a man as Taylor, the fall could not be greater.The threat of having his balls lopped off compels Taylor to escape. He leads the apes about in a merry chase around their village and gets pelted with rotten fruit and finally snagged in a net. As the gorilla guards move in to apprehend him, Heston utters the classic line, ""Take your paws off me, you damn dirty ape!""He's quickly rushed to trial. Dr. Zaius, the orangutan Minister of Science and Defender of the Faith (in a nice satirical touch), is hell bent on having Taylor put down, and his chimp patrons censored.This anti-human attitude just makes Taylor, the devout misanthrope, earnestly wonder why Dr. Zaius fears and hates him so. He should just ask his earlier self.Taylor views man as weak and pathetic; everything he says about humanity drips with scorn, from his disgust for his fellow astronauts to his sneering contempt for the weakness of a long dead man who once possessed ancient artifacts (a pacemaker, spectacles) that the apes unearth.Near the end of the film, Cornelius, at the behest of Dr. Zaius, reads from The Sacred Scrolls:""Beware the beast Man for he is the Devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates he kills for sport or lust or greed. Yea he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land. Let him not breed in great numbers for he will make a desert of his home and yours. Shun him; drive him back into his jungle lair for he is the harbinger of death.""Whereupon Charlton promptly goes out and discovers his destiny, and the truth: he was home all along. Man is indeed the harbinger of death, and by the megaton.Taylor is an arrogant, smug narcissist. A self-made God. As Grouchy Marx might say, he is someone who 'would never belong to any club that would have him.'And humanity, ages ago, delivered on Taylor's low expectations.He ends the film pounding his fist helplessly into the surf, bowed before the crumbling remains of the Statue of Liberty.It's an image laden with symbolism, and the scene is a slap in the face, a visual scream, a wake-up call, demanding us to do better, to not let the writers, and ourselves, down. To prove we're better than what Taylor believes us to be.That's one heck of a political statement for a mainstream film.The only film with a bleaker ending is the sequel.",Planet of the Apes

One of the reasons why I personally enjoyed Planet of the Apes was because not only did it have a great cast with Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, and Kim Hunter, but it drew many comparisons to how humans mistreat nature/animals just like the apes severely mistreated and abused the helpless humans. The film convicted me of how I sometimes abuse nature/animals when I do not realize it. Another reason why I found Planet of the Apes so intriguing was because of the endless suspense that kept me on my toes the entire time I was watching the film. The way in which Planet of the Apes was directed kept me wanting to see what happened next in each of the following films after the original. Lastly, I just simply enjoyed the characters such as Dr. Cornelius and Dr. Zira and how they went out of their way to help Taylor despite the fact no one else wanted to help him and they knew they could be killed because of it. Dr. Cornelius and Dr. Zira were characters who promoted peace, and I enjoy watching characters in movies do what they feel is right even when nobody else around them chooses to do so.

The apes' society is shown as a dogmatic world where narrow-minded intellectuals seek to keep the status quo and supremacy of ape over man...This film is a satirical parable on modern society. You do not have to think hard about the apes' behaviour to recognize our own world. Such a point of view is not easy to realize well. It could have ended in a film that is as dogmatic as the society it wants to criticize or the message could have appeared banal. Here, neither of both has happened. The story is intelligent as well as exciting -- a perfect mixture.However, if you know that Charlton Heston, the star of ""Planet of the Apes"", is chairman of the National Rifle Association (NRA) and defends the right of every American to have a gun, the last fifteen minutes where Taylor moves around always carrying a gun with him, these scenes get a little strange smack.",Planet of the Apes

341,Thuriboh,"Made in 1968, still amazing to this day, that's what makes a movie a classic!",10,9 March 2012,"I am newly introduced to the planet of the apes series and I must say that in my opinion this film stands high up as other sci-fi masterpieces like the Original Star Wars Trilogy,the older Star Trek movies, Terminator, Terminator 2, The Thing (1982), The Matrix, Back To The Future and probably The Alien Series (haven't watched those yet) and is one of my favourites as well. To bad that the original gets a lot of praise but the sequels are way underrated and they should deserve little more attention than what they get even if they turned out to be B-movies in the process. Luckily the series has established a cult following and soon when I have watched all of the 'ape-movies' I will surely be one of themBut let's have a look on this one. The script has inspiration from a novel and the dialouge is great and does contain some memorable lines. The Setting is futuristic and post-apocalyptic just like sci-fi fans love. The Actors are all great especially Charlton Heston and Maurice Evans, The character of Taylor is very well portrayed and Dr. Zaíus is awesome as the villain. The Story is brilliant and the ending is simply mind-blowing, sadly I eventually did spoil it for myself but it is powerful. In fact I can't find anything bad about this movie, everything is executed good, so i'm just gonna say that I love it.So if you love sci-fi and haven't seen this one... well what are you waiting for? Pick it up anywhere, watch and enjoy!It is a solid 10/10.",Planet of the Apes
342,DYMOduzen,Not as cheesy as expected. better than some movies today,10,12 April 2012,"Everyone knows about Planet of the Apes. this is just one of those classic sic-fi movies that everyone knows about. this is also known for being an incredibly cheesy movie about taking apes. I know this is exactly what I expected when I first downloaded this movie because I was bored. But I have to say this movie went beyond my expectations. As a matter of fact this is one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. The movie is about a man and his crew of astronauts who go onto a mission into space. their ship crash-lands on an unknown planet. On this planet is a flip flopped society where humans behave as animals and Apes are the civilized intelligent race, wearing cloths, living in houses, and of coarse, talk, and even hunt the humans who are naked, mute living in the wild. however the astronauts from our planet are of coarse civilized. but are captured by a Ape hunting group. things start to get interesting when one of the astronaut show signs of actually being capable of thought, which of coarse in this simian society is supposedly impossible. The plot may sound somewhat cheesy, but trust me, it isn't. this movie is huge on social commentary, and questions about the very society we live in. This movie really never feels silly at any point.My one issue with this movie is the first 30 minutes of it, which some really slow and painfully boring moments. even with moment where nothing appears to be happening. But when the Apes make their first appearance, the movie couldn't be more exciting.I would recommend this movie to any fan of sic-fi, or even anyone who has ever enjoyed a movie.9/10",Planet of the Apes
343,acestanley2002,best ending ever!,10,31 May 2005,i think that this movie had the best shock moment at the end of the film than any other film in history. i saw this movie when i was about 9 years old and was fascinated with the thought of apes evolving on another planet and had heard nothing about the ending. when the camera pulls out at the end and shows the statue of liberty i about sh_t my pants. i was totally shocked and awed and i will always remember that moment. i think this movie holds up even today and was way better than tim burtons awful remake. i mean come on mark wahlberg versus charlton heston. heston wins this one easily. moses vs dirk diggler ha! for the times the makeup job on the apes was excellent and its too bad they had to make 4 more of these movies and ruin the franchise.,Planet of the Apes

345,pamaras2006,Classic Movie,10,9 November 2007,"Planet Of The Apes would have to be in the top ten movies ever made if not my favourite.I've seen it many times,but when I first saw it as a kid in the 70s it just blew me away,with how realistic it seemed.Remember at the time I never knew any of the actors,so there was no typecast actors, adding to the feeling of realism.Throughout the movie it felt all realistic,where I just got lost in the movie as though I was in it.Not knowing the actors in good movies makes it that much more believable.That's why these days they just can't make classic movies like this.These days they always use the same actors.How can that be believable!The magic of a good movie is when your captivated by the superb acting and get caught up inside the movie.Back then I never knew who Charlton Heston was,so it worked its magic on me,but also I was just a kid with a big imagination.So I'm not sure how I'd feel if I were to see it for the first time now.Still for what it did to me I would have to give it a ten.I still have those memories of THE PLANET OF THE APES.",Planet of the Apes

""Get your hands off me..."" Great line. What brilliance. When i first saw it the ending really got to me. I was all like whoa... nice. The other interesting part of this movie is that they develop the ape characters which is nice. Not just the main character. Which is nice. Also a little love interests, lol ape and human, not so different if you ask me. The little simplicity of this movie are nice.

I think this impression was fashioned by the sequels that were in fact quite cheesy. The cinematography in the opening scenes is breathtaking. Every once and a while your expectations are surpassed by such a large margin that it makes being a movie buff a real thrill. Give it a try you will like it.,Planet of the Apes
349,gdcm,A very underrated film,10,27 December 1999,"Planet of the Apes is a very underrated film. A brilliant comment on society today and what could happen.

It is equally as chilling.",Planet of the Apes

The acting, the screenplay, the direction, the music score, the setting, the costumes, and of course the best movie ending in film history. As many times as I have seen it, within the first ten minutes of the film, I forget that Heston is on planet Earth all along. Now that's great movie making. This film is still so current with its theme of what man is unfortunately capable of doing to itself and the planet if it does not wise up. But back to the film, the way it just sets you up to truly believe that you are on a different planet and are surrounded by all those alien cultures when in fact it is Earth was simply genius. The acting in this film was great by all cast members, especially Kim Hunter.Take the time to watch this film. It is the best ever.",Planet of the Apes
351,seankrieger,A nihilistic and sociopolitical dystopian satire that remains iconic over time.,9,29 May 2019,"Planet of the Apes is the masterpiece that Arthur P. Jacobs envisioned it to be before Pierre Boulle finished his book La Planète des singes that the film would be based on. Even through its difficulty of finding a studio that would produce the film, Rewriting Rod Sterling's script that took thirty drafts and and over a year to write, recasting Hollywood legend Edward G. Robinson for the role of Dr. Zaius, balancing its budget, dealing with a hot climate, and most famously, creating believable apes. Its distinct score crafted wonderfully by Jerry Goldsmith flows beautifully with Leon Shamroy's cinematography and William J. Creber's sets. What this crew has accomplished is truly a work of art with a unique political awareness and style that remains iconic to this day. And that's without even mentioning the actors!
Charlton Heston knocks his role out of the park in his performance of the cynical astronaut Taylor, Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter perfectly portray the two ape scientists Cornelius and Dr. Zira even through the difficulty of the makeup, Linda Harrison portrays the 'savage' human Nova to a tee considering her lack of lines, and Robert Gunner and Jeff Burton pull of convincing co-astronauts as Landon and Dodge who both synergize with Charleton Heston's character Taylor in the first act of the film.
Speaking of the plot, the opening scene establishes Taylor's beliefs effectively in such a small amount of time and manages to establish the tone of the film, as it should. The effects put into the spaceship crash still hold up after fifty years and the script in the first act convincingly depicts the three astronauts, their conflicting views, and their constant attempt of survival in the desertous region later called the 'Forbidden Zone.' The scene were the Gorillas hunt the humans is the golden standard for all action scenes.
The second act does a fantastic job at putting the audience in Taylor's agonizingly frustrating situation of containment and state of nonacceptance. The chase scene through the ape scene is professionally shot and the human museum within it containing the remains of Dodge is terrifying.
The third act capitalizes on suspense as Lucious breaks Taylor out of his cage and they all make for the dig site in the caves. The surprise of the human artifacts in the archeological dig, particularly the doll that speaks, provides a hint at the iconic big reveal at the end of the film, which is gorgeously shot and beautifully executed, especially with the well-written script.
Overall, the film is a science fiction/dystopian masterpiece as the stunning visuals and music guides the audience through this thought provoking new planet of the apes to bask in its nihilistic and sociopolitical themes. It really is a masterpiece, and who would have thought so, other than Producer Arthur P. Jacobs.",Planet of the Apes
352,oldorange,Planet of the Apes from a child,10,5 May 2006,"As a child, this movie was something that broadened my horizons as they say. Opened my then little mind up into a whole new area of thinking. I remember being completely blown away by the movie and mind boggling idea it represented. It is still a fantastic and well done film. Much better than the new version.Look for my birthday in the opening scenes, and also, later, the ""hidden monkey head"", sorta like a hidden mickey for you Disneyland fans.I think it oversimplifies the contrast/complement between religion and science, and in that sense is small minded.I still remember the feeling I had at the end of the movie upon seeing that first ray appear in the frame from the statue's crown and realizing where Taylor was.

It is funny, clever, exciting, well acted, great make up, use of locations, one of the best films scores ever written, and the best twist ending of all time(Yes even better than Sixth Sense). Charlton Heston is perfect as the lead hero astronaut a man so disillusioned with life on earth he literally leaves it hoping to find something better than what he sees. Be careful what you wish for because he comes face to face with the complete opposite of the men he knew on earth. Now he is inferior to civilized race of intelligent talking apes.

358,trixster77,A classic sci-fi movie,9,10 April 2002,"Planet of the Apes is one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time. Never mind that, one of the greatest movies of all time. It still is enjoyable, even after 30+ years. You just can't not like it. The story is this: Four American astronauts, led by Colonel George Taylor (Charlton Heston), are returning home after a tour of the universe. They all go into suspended animation, and are awoken when their spacecraft crashes onto a distant world, light years from Earth. They are soon captured by a group of hunters who, surprisingly, are apes. On this backwards world, apes hunt humans, and put them in cages for amusement (Sound familiar?). Taylor must escape his captivity and find out a way to get home. All while trying to avoid the apes. The premise is based on a novel of the same name by Pierre Boulle, published in 1912. The screenplay, however, is written by Michael Wilson ('Lawrence of Arabia') and Rod Serling ('The Twilight Zone'), so the story's got good roots. But there's more than just that. Heston, Roddy McDowell (as Dr. Cornelius, a scientist), and Kim Hunter (as Dr. Zira, another scientist who feels sorry for Taylor) all give outstanding performances. The makeup, for 1968, is unbelievable. The art & set direction is excellent. And most of all, the twist ending will blow you away. There are only a few minor flaws in Planet of the Apes. One, it was followed by four sequels, none of which even came close to the original. Two, it was remade by Tim Burton recently, who had Mark Wahlberg playing the lead. And three, it might seem too weird for first-time viewers. Other than that, its flawless. I gave this film 9/10. The only reason I didn't give it 10/10 is because it's from 1968, and I don't tend to like old movies. But you might. I don't know how else to say it. If you haven't already seen Planet of the Apes, see it now!",Planet of the Apes
359,gregoryortega,"Great writing, acting, makeup and Statement! This film has it all!",10,4 May 2002,"I was 7 or 8 when this film first came out, and the impact it's had has stayed with me all this time.  Only in my later years did I come to understand Heston's role as a man who hated or resented the Human Race and then later in the film had to defend man.  Perfectly casted, the studio could have cut corners by hiring unknowns in the ape makeup, but they filled the screen with veteran actors who could ""act through"" the make-ups perfectly. The action, the message and the impact are still there! Unfortunately, the 2001 re-make doesn't stack up against this classic. You can tell the 2001 version was rushed and hastily put together.",Planet of the Apes
360,DP_Lemoine,damn you bloody apes!!!,10,20 July 2008,"What has quite happened? Is this possibly real? A planet full of bloody apes who have obtained the will to talk, reason, and communicate with one another? This is all going to one man's head and in a situation like this you have quite no capability to a keep your complete sanity. Things you never seen yet so familiar. People like you acting like creatures like that, and creatures like that acting like people like you. When you believe you are the only thing of your type in a world with reason what would you do. Well, this is Planet of the Apes for you my friends, and oh boy it's a treat. A film that is the best of it's kind is a must see to ALL, and believe me it's like no other.

No disrespect intended, but all of the supporting cast acted circles around Mr. Heston. I really think this film would have been much more superb had the lead been casted better. I know this was the 60's and the ""big names"" of Hollywood always got the roles first, but this is one role that should have been cast differently. His transparency & forced punction was quite obvious. Like I said, no disrespect intended, but I would have enjoyed it much more with a more believable performance by a different leading man. I still highly suggest this film for all ages. Wasn't ""The Graduate"" also done in the 60's?

Before I am criticized for comparing apples to oranges, let me pose the following analogy. Imagine the Dawn of Man sequence from 2001 as the beginning of Planet of the Apes. Next, play the Blue Danube while we watch Taylor's spacecraft floating around space. Now, do the whole fancy color thing while they are traveling. Keep everything else just the way it is. Now, imagine 2001 without these three sequences.The first scenario would make an already excellent movie even better. The second scenario would take the best stuff out of a film which many hail as the best sci-fi movie of all time and leave us with about forty-five minutes of emotionless dialogue.",Planet of the Apes
363,odenim,The Best!,10,16 April 2020,Best science fiction movie of all time! Ranked #1 in my personal movies list.,Planet of the Apes
364,ang1,Living with the Apes: celebrating 35 years,10,17 February 2004,"I became a dedicated fan of this movie during the early seventies when I first watched it as a young lad. The experience was so exciting I can still remember the tremendous impact it had on me. How can I ever forget that imaginative twist that was kept a secret, it was brilliant!A lot has been written and said about this story of three astronauts who crash on an alien planet run by intelligent apes. Why has it stood the test of time still captivating audiences 35 years after its release? Why should anyone watch this movie about talking monkeys? The most logical explanation is that it hits the bulls-eye and works on so many levels. It appeals to everyone's imagination- the young will be fascinated by the old fashioned adventure while the older thinking generation will be intrigued by the thought-provoking drama. But this isn't the only reason this film became a classic, many factors contributed to its success.Franklin Schaffner was given a great script by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson who had spent hundreds of hours perfecting their final draft. His direction was masterful. He managed to establish a strange unknown world by using mysterious locations. His cinematographer Leon Shamroy effectively used the bizarre landscape and his colour photography looks stunning. Adding effect to this strange atmosphere were the wonderful sets and the primitive looking architecture of the ape city.The acting and characterizations were memorable. Charlton Heston (Taylor) pulled off an outstanding performance. His forceful character and screen persona keeps the film involving and moving along at a good pace. We a rewarded with some great one-liners, he deserved an Oscar nomination at least. The rest of the main cast was excellent too. Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter who play the chimpanzee protagonists Cornelius and Zira balance out the stronger role of Heston's by supporting him with lighter performances. They bring a sense of reality by showing us how simians of this upside-down world have evolved from the apes that currently live on earth. Their movements and expressions are so exceptional that you can see their emotions coming through the prosthetics. Working under so much make-up and costumes was not easy. The main antagonist is played by Maurice Evans who plays an orangutan leader Dr. Zaius who knows the big secret about man right from the start. His role is pivotal in maintaining the hatred apes have towards humans.The striking image of the apes is the film's strong element. The remarkable make-up is innovative and very realistic. It was ground-breaking in 1968 and today is equally effective. John Chambers won a special Academy Award for his efforts. He and his team needed many hours to apply the make-up to each ape character. This was extremely tiring and stressful for the actors. The different clothing and colourization used also strongly symbolized the apes' social structure, it was very thoughtful.Jerry Goldsmith's score is unique and original. It's an uncomfortable collection of noise from various common and exotic instruments, sounds that you've never experienced before. It is very haunting and maximizes the eerie and mysterious mood of the film and contributes to the weird atmosphere of the strange world.An intellectual view of the movie reveals the social, political and religious issues which are still valid today. Whether the writers' intentions (especially Wilson's) were to criticize our society is anyone's guess. It's true that during the sixties America was facing many problems, among others the cold war and Vietnam and race relations between whites and blacks. The film holds up well today because it still manages to get these messages across in an accessible enjoyable way. It's telling us to look in the mirror and question our strengths and weaknesses, to ask ourselves if technology will dominate us in the future. Will it eventually lead to something horrible like our own destruction? It's ironic that Richard Zanuck the Fox chief who green-lighted the movie back then didn't see it as a message movie especially during its early years.Without a doubt the most popular reason this movie has achieved its classic status is simply because it is grand entertainment. The answer is in the script. The stylish story is a combination of exciting adventure with likeable characters and intelligent dialogue mixed with suspense and intrigue which maximizes the tension. Then when the pace slows down and you start to feel relaxed in your chair.bang it shocks you visually! Of course the biggest shock of all is the surprise ending. This was the ace that the producers kept for the last scene. It pushes the film from great to a classic masterpiece. The twist with its powerful visual sting ranks as the greatest ending to any motion picture in cinema history, you are left paralyzed! It created a milestone and a visionary accomplishment that changed Science Fiction movies.Sit back and enjoy this gem. You won't regret it!!A final tribute: Arthur P. Jacobs was responsible for the production (Mort Abrahams was his associate producer) which was based on an idea he conceived while reading Pierre Boulle's book Monkey Planet. Obtaining the rights he began his long and difficult struggle with the uninterested studios, eventually closing a deal with 20th Century Fox. The rest is movie history. In your memory I thank you for bringing your dream Planet of the Apes to the screen and for making it an unforgettable Science Fiction film deserving a place amongst the best cinema achievements.",Planet of the Apes
365,feroz-mansoor,The one and only title that stands out,9,9 May 2012,"The ""Planet of the Apes"" remake was awful since it had horrible dialogue and a different storyline. But this film (aka. The first Planet of the Apes title) actually followed the elements of the novel. I had to say it was worth watching if you don't mind being annoyed by the corny lines. But what caught my attention was how unique the props and style the film incorporated. I especially loved the action in the film that made you feel like you're watching some sort of Armageddon-like battle between apes and mankind. Also, what made sense in this film was the fact that apes actually carried firearms, unlike in the remake, which made a big impact on its story.

Charleton Heston is the ultimate action hero, and he very boldly delivers some of the most famous lines in history. if nothing else, see this movie for it's cultural influence. what i loved most about it though, was the moral and ethical questions it posed about dominance in whatever we consider to be modern society. sheer brilliance on many levels. please DO see this film, it will make you think about your place in the universe as a human and what the significance of your life is, and what kind of legacy humans leave behind them. this is a real movie, you don't see those much anymore.",Planet of the Apes
368,victormordoh,tremendous movie,9,3 February 2017,I recently watched this movie again with my 22 year old son who had never seen it.. He was amazed on how truly great it is.. how realistic the apes look and the meaningful subject manner.d Don't bother with the remakes.. The original is far better.. By changing the novel to lower the technological level brings this story to a very relatable level for the viewer. The amazing makeup work by John Chambers brought the apes to life and the acting work by Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowell brought a humanity and believablity to the humans. The fact that Charlton Heston plays his character as a pretty disagreeable and unlikable human keeps most of the focus on the apes and their history. Beware the ending. When I first saw the movie in the early 70's it was a hell of a shock. Enjoy it.,Planet of the Apes
369,alazor-58030,Franklin J. Schaffner's 1968 Planet of the Apes details the plight of George Taylor in an ape dominated world.,10,2 March 2017,"Schaffner's Planet of the Apes is a timeless movie due to the movie's focus on humanity's characteristics. Schaffner exploits humanity's characteristics by using a paradoxical ape- dominant earth to show how humanity has a caste system desired to dominate others, a drive for self independence, and is always affected by religion.Planet of the Apes utilizes a paradoxical twist to expose humanity's ability to dominate others. Taylor's first encounter with domination took place in his first encounter between the primitive humans and the gorillas. After they find their clothes shredded due to the primitive humans, the gorillas spontaneously charge out into the field. A scene ensues with gorillas shooting humans or capturing the them with nets, with two of Taylor's crew mates killed and himself shot in the throat. Schaffner depicts the apes' brutality in this scene, with a reverse role of humans as the hunted. Today, humans dominate animals, and can at times even replicate the brutality of this scene. Schaffner's reversal of role in this scene piques the interest of the audience by exposing in essence what humans do to animals. Another analog Schaffner alludes to is racial tensions. With the movie made in 1968, the Unites States was in racial turmoil amidst the Civil Rights movements' crusade against racial injustice. As Taylor enters the ape society, he notices that the society is not truly unified as they say they are. The blond haired orangutans, the religious faction of the apes, are conservative in their efforts to keep their society as devoid of knowledge of human intelligence. The intermedium skinned chimpanzees, the intelligent scientist of their society, are seems as intelligent but not as religious enough to the orangutans' eye. The dark skinned gorillas, the militaristic faction of Ape City, are looked down on as the unintelligent apes. Schaffner depicts the species tensions with this caste system, with the orangutans at the top of the social hierarchy, the chimpanzees as the intermediate, and the gorillas as the lowest apes. This parallels to the racial tensions during the 1960's, with the Caucasians at the top of the social hierarchy. Schaffner's analog is relevant as it provides insight into the 1960's era, with a paradoxical twist.Planet of the Apes uses Taylor's attractive quality of self independence to connect with the audience. As Taylor is about to be captured by the Ape police after his escape, he yells, ""Get your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape!"". This act of defiance makes the viewer enamored with Taylor's self independence despite him facing against a society entirely against him. Even Charlton Heston, the actor who played Taylor, showed self independence when he changed the line from ""Get away from me, you dirty ape!"", which was less defiant as his improvised line. One of the most defiant acts took place in the dying moments of the movie. As Taylor is about to leave into the unknown with Nova, Dr. Zaius warns him of the perils he will face. Dr Zaius tells Taylor, ""Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate"", with Taylor responding defiantly: ""Sure. In a cage"". Dr Zaius then declares ""Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?"". Taylor then declares that he will ""take freedom"". This spark of defiance, of forging his own path, emulates with Americans and the mantra of freedom and independence. Charlton Heston, a rugged individual outside of acting, perfectly portrayed the individualism of Taylor in Planet of the Apes. Schaffner criticizes and analyzes religion in Planet of the Apes, with his analysis still relevant today. As stated earlier, the ape society is spearheaded by the conservative orangutans. These orangutans emphasize religion above science, most notably when confronted by Zira and Cornelius. Taylor talks to Dr Zaius about his confusion over the findings in the cave and the artifacts of humans, Dr Zaius declares to Taylor, ""And you were right--I have always known about man"". Dr Zaius, speaking on behalf of the orangutans, does not want to rectify the existence of intelligent humans as it counters the mantra of the ape as God's people. As Taylor rides off along the shoreline, Dr Zaius orders his men to seal the cave of evidence using explosive. The main artifact, the talking doll, showed that the humans were intelligent. Zira and Cornelius, flabbergasted, ask about the doll as proof to bring back to Ape City. Dr Zaius responds, ""In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be"". The line ""There can't be"" is the most powerful line. Schaffner suggest here that religions tend to know science and the theory of evolution, but simply do not acknowledge it. Schaffner also suggests that humans in one way or another worship the same God. Zira's parting words to Taylor depict this: ""Go with God, Taylor. That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man"". Lastly, Schaffner also calls into question the existence of God. As Taylor sees the fragmented Statue of Liberty, realizing that humans annihilated each other in war, he agonizingly yells, ""My God!"". This ironic phrase calls into question if whether or not there is a all-powerful deity, as he would have stopped the catastrophe of human cannibalism.Planet of the Apes use of paradoxical themes contrives the viewer into questioning human existence. Schaffner first explores the idea of humans dominating each other, most notably racially, with the use of the ape society and primitive humans. Schaffner also explores the notion of the American rigged individual, best employed by Heston as Taylor. Lastly, and arguably most profoundly, Schafnner explores religion as a theme and questions the sanity of it. Schaffner's Planet of the Apes is a classic that has lived the test of time due to its portrayal of themes that still prevail in modern America.",Planet of the Apes
370,williamoahlgren,A flawed but still entertaining sci-fi classic,10,2 November 2018,"By switching the societal and mental state between men and apes, the movie delivers at times thought provoking and interesting commentary on intolerance and racism. But that's not the only thing that Planet of the Apes has on its mind, as between the attacks on social injustice the film also deals with the apparent eternal conflict between faith and science. These themes are by far the most interesting things the film has to offer, even though they are mostly handled quite bluntly and not with the deepest sense of care.A special nod should also of course go to the ape costumes which allow the actors to express themselves quite impressively. Even though the design of the costumes themselves haven't aged that well, they were innovative for the time and certainly get the job done.The soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith deserves mention also as it immensely adds to the atmosphere of the film. Instead of applying a cliché ""sci-fi sound"" Goldsmith uses familiar instruments and sprinkles them together with a few effects to really make you feel as lost and scared as Charlton Heston does through the movie.Speaking of Charlton Heston, his performance certainly falls under the category of ""uneven"". He does relate some sympathy when he is most effective, but in the next scene he might have you unintentionally laughing out loud at his line deliveries, facial expressions and wild shouting. And that's not a specific problem with Heston as the script has its faults too. When it's not able to bring a serious tone as it at times strives for, it will also intentionally sabotage the serious-minded moments with humor. Sometimes it can have an enjoyable effect but at other times you wish they hade stuck with a consistent tone.These problems along with dated gender roles might hinder your complete enjoyment of this film. Whether or not you want to call this a classic or not is entirely dependent on how forgiving you are with the film's flaws. But what can certainly be said is that Planet of the Apes still remains grand entertainment after about 50 years. And the ending absolutely earns its place as one of the most iconic in movie history.",Planet of the Apes
371,theotadros,the only 15 year old whose seen this film,9,22 May 2017,"Charlton Heston excels in the initial installment of the later to be franchise of ""the Planet of the Apes"", providing a riveting experience for the general public and critics alike. The film sets itself out as an instant classic, with an unnerving twist that makes you feel unsettled in your seat; and that's from a 2017 point of view, in the perspective of someone in 1968 you would be left feeling petrified with the fear of the bomb was not an irrational one. The film entails the story of Taylor, the main protagonist who has the horrible experience of seeing is crew get killed one by one, even before they've set foot off the ship. He shortly finds out on the island that Apes are the dominant species on the planet that they have crash landed on and it is the humans that are illiterate and dumb. Taylor finds himself to be an anomaly amongst the other mentally subnormal humans and it is not long after he is apprehended by apes, that they find this out too. It is then that he shows his ability to comprehend speech and write, before later revealing his ability to speak in the infamous line ""Get your stinkin' paws off me you damn dirty ape"". During all this time, Taylor has befriended an ""ape doctor"" who was the first to recognise his intelligence and it is her and her husband whom help Taylor to escape so that he may be free to roam the planet, it is not long though before he is warned of what lies in the forbidden territory with the ambiguous line from Dr Zaius - ""The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago."", this is the first reference of two in the film to the bomb and the cold war; the second being Taylor discovery of a destroyed Statue of Liberty.",Planet of the Apes
372,sczm,Planet of the Apes,6,20 November 2005,"Sleeping for two thousand years yeah that's real believable. Now I'm a fan of science fiction movies but this one just did not make any sense to me. With only one crew member dying in the ship while the other three survived. The way all the water started spraying in the ship was not very believable, since the ship would have been air tight so nothing from space could get in or out of the ship. The acting was not very believable throughout the movie like when they were coming down the hill at the beginning of the movie and fell when they got to the bottom. Come on now that hill was not even that steep for them to fall when they got to the bottom. The apes did not even look like real apes. When they get attacked all the humans are running around in different directions while the apes are on horseback with guns shooting humans that are running away. They also have nets that they throw on the humans and drag them so they can not get away. The scientist apes all have nice clothing to wear while the humans have pretty much nothing to wear. It shows that the humans really are at the bottom in this world. The humans are made to do work for the apes while they are locked in cages and buildings. The movie ends with George Taylor and a lady riding horse back across the beach and seeing the Statue of Liberty under sand. George realizes that he was on planet Earth along just two thousand years in the future. I personally recommend seeing the new release of Planet of the Apes because the storyline seems easier to follow.",Planet of the Apes
373,newcastle1,"IMHO, the best movie ever made. Ever.",10,5 May 2006,"I don't really see the point in adding the ""spoiler"" warning, as this movie is nearly 40 years old and I find it hard to believe that anyone hasn't seen it. But in the interests of harmony, I'll play by the rules :-)I think I first saw this movie when I was just four or five, and have watched it many times since. It's quite simply the most exquisite piece of cinema ever created... and that's just based on the final scene. I can take or leave the rest, although of course the plot development is vital to the final scene, but Mr Heston's disbelief and rage at what had become of the Earth he knew is the most powerful thing I've ever seen.And being a huge Simpsons fan, I also quite like the two references they made to this epic: Troy McClure starring in the hilarious musical version of Planet of the Apes and the ""Dr Zaius"" song to the tune of ""Amadeus"" by Falco, and Homer's ""damn you all to hell!"" in another episode.The only downside for me is that it completely ruined Roddy McDowell for me... I could never watch him in anything else without picturing him in the superb award-winning simian makeup and twitching his nose!",Planet of the Apes
374,auntieentity,Watched it on the Big Screen-,9,30 March 2006,"Last night at the OKC art museum. This makes the 3rd time I've watched this movie all the way through. Some observations: The first time, I was maybe 12 years old and every bit of the movie worked, especially the ending (I had to stay up until 1:00am, but it was worth it). One of the best movie watching experiences of that time.I think I caught it sometime later in high school, and it was still good, although I was a bit surprised at how dated the whole 'evolution vs. religion' debate seemed to be, and how hard it was to watch C. Heston and not see C. Heston.2006: This movie dates from a time when movies, and sci-fi movies even, were being made for grown-ups. One of its center-pieces is a trial, even. People worked very hard on this movie and it showed- the sets and costumes and all. There is also a really keen shot right after the crash where the camera pans up from the spaceship in the water then rotates around, showing the incredibly bleak place they've found.It is amazing how thoroughly unlikable Capt. Taylor is. How refreshing! I grow weary of these bland good-guys. One gets the feeling that, once they lifted off from earth, he became an even bigger jerk.Ironically, Dr. Zaeus seems more sympathetic every time I watch the movie. Just how much does he know? HOw far is he willing to go to 'keep the faith'? He knows that they apes will eventually go into, or around, the forbidden zone.It is also amazing how the whole science vs religion, truth vs comfortable lies thing is suddenly so relevant again- at least in the U.S.I guess my major stumbling block was that Taylor should have been able to put together that he was on earth. After all, the language and writing of the apes is English. I can understand why they did it, but it would have been a stronger movie if they had worked around it a little better.",Planet of the Apes
