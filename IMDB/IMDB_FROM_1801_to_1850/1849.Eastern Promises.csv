0,TheLittleSongbird,Brutal sins,9,17 May 2019,"David Cronenberg is up there to me as one of the most unique and most fascinating directors out there. Not many other directors explore challenging and complex themes in a way that really gets under the skin, disturbing the viewer and making them feel uncomfortable. If anybody does feel that, that's a good thing as that is what Cronenberg and his films aim to do and to me it has seldom gotten excessive. Have also gotten a lot of dark wit and especially emotion from his films (especially 'The Fly'), which makes his work much more than full on body horror.'Eastern Promises' is a very different film from Cronenberg's early work from the 70s and 80s, being a thriller whereas much of his early work was horror, though 'The Fly' onwards did see a more dramatic edge. And also exploring the very much completely different subject of violence and identity, which he also did in his previous effort 'A History of Violence'. To me, this is one of the best of his later films (by quite some way actually) and also one of his best overall. It's one of his more mature films but at the same time like 'The Fly' and 'Dead Ringers', two other favourites fo his, it's one of his more accessible. This is coming from somebody who likes to loves much of his work, though am not going to say that every film of his is good ('Cosmopolis' being one of his more notable disappointments, from personal opinion) and there are films that fit in my ""appreciated and admired"" category than ""love and enjoy"" one.My only criticism for 'Eastern Promises' is the ending, which did feel abrupt and its tone and how too easily resolved it is felt like it belonged in a different film. It should strictly speaking have been the most exciting scene, but the film just fizzled out just like that, a shame.However, 'Eastern Promises' looks great, loved the locations which were just as threatening as the characters and there is plenty of atmosphere in the grimy yet still audacious photography from Cronenberg regular Peter Suschitzky. Another Cronenberg regular penned the music score, Howard Shore's score here is thrillingly dramatic without being over-bearing and another case of a non-human character feeling like a character of its own, so much of an impact it makes. Felt no clinical coldness from Cronenberg, instead it's ambitious and pulls no punches which adds hugely to the unsettlement.The script is thought-provoking and lean enough without much, if at all, of a padded feel. The switch between languages was not a problem here, never confused me and actually found it authentic, and never has been a problem in film. It is something that is seen frequently in film for authenticity reasons and rightly so. The story is up until the ending very gripping and drips with intensity with the distinctive effectively stomach-churning Cronenberg visual touches. Other than a disturbing opening, the film's highlight is the turkish baths sequence which is astonishingly choreographed and uncompromisingly brutal. The pace didn't feel too fast or too slow, and the characters interest.Viggo Mortensen is just captivating here and gives one of his best performances in a chillingly calculating fashion. He does a decent stab at the accent, which is not an easy accent to master without overdoing or stereotyping and to me he did neither, and he is not too shabby at all (quite the opposite) at speaking in Russian, again not an easy language to master with so many rules regarding all the different vowels and hard and soft signs. Vincent Cassel is the same in providing one of his best performances, don't think he has been better actually, while Armin Mueller-Stahl is suitably sinister. Naomi Watts' role is not as meaty but she still gives a thoughtful performance and Sinead Cusack does much with her short appearance.Concluding, a great film. 9/10",Eastern Promises
1,Leofwine_draca,Mature and involving thriller,9,6 July 2016,"Ever since the '70s, David Cronenberg has been an edgy, unconventional director whose unflinching forays into the worlds of horror, body deformity and sexuality have garnered him a loyal fan base and rave reviews. In recent years, he's moved away from more outlandish fare to focus on gritty, realistic thrillers. After the success of 2005's A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, he returns with this London-set thriller which explores the world of the Russian mafia, specifically through the tattoos worn by members which really do reveal their lifetime achievements.In essence this is Viggo Mortensen's film – after he did so well in HISTORY I didn't think he'd be able to top that performance, but he does and in spades. He makes his cold, calculating driver into a human being with hidden depths and it's one of those performances that you simply can't avert your eyes from. Cronenberg strives for a look at the 'truth' in this thriller; at first I thought it was going to be a revenge-style picture but in the end it's entirely unpredictable, with different strands for different lives mingling together.The subject matter is understandably dark, but to help us through there are some great performers here – Naomi Watts, so much better than in KING KONG, as the investigative midwife; Armin Mueller-Stahl as the grandiose mob boss, and finally Vincent Cassel as yet another creepy perverted type. Cronenberg moves away from the visceral even further, although the brief bursts of violence are here as disturbing as ever – there are slit throats to rival SWEENEY TODD and a naked bathhouse battle with plenty of eye-opening moments. EASTERN PROMISES is undeniably the director's most mature movie to date, and it's a brilliant one too.",Eastern Promises
2,SnoopyStyle,So much intensity,8,10 August 2014,"In London, a Russian pregnant teen Tatiana stumbles into a drugstore bleeding. Anna Khitrova (Naomi Watts) is the midwife who delivered the baby but Tatiana dies. Anna steals her journal and finds a card of a Russian restaurant owned by Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl). He offers to translate it and she brings a copy. He keeps trying to get the book. His driver guard Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen) is intense. His son Kirirll (Vincent Cassel) is a drunken brute. When her motorcycle doesn't start, Nikolai drives her home. Her uncle Stepan reluctantly translates the journal. Semyon is the Russian mob boss and his son Kirirll (Vincent Cassel) raped Tatiana at 14. They broke her and forces her to work as a prostitute. Uncle Stepan would like to go to the KGB. Her mother wants to leave it. Anna wants to get the baby back to Tatiana's family.There is an intensity that is apparent from the first moment of this director David Cronenberg's film. It goes from slitting a throat to the bloody pregnant girl to the very intense trio of Armin, Vincent, and Viggo. This is Viggo Mortensen's movie more than Naomi Watts. She's alright but Viggo is crazy intense. There is desolation in the film that isn't showy but deeper. It doesn't take funny turns to allow the audience to laugh it off. The violence is dark and not the kung fu kind. There is something about naked fighting. The morality is ugly to say the least. It's a desert where seeds of humanity struggle to survive.",Eastern Promises
3,claudio_carvalho,From Russia with Violence,8,22 July 2008,"In London, the Russian pregnant teenager Tatiana arrives bleeding in a hospital, and the doctors save her baby only. The Russian descendant midwife Anna Khitrova (Naomi Watts) finds Tatiana's diary written in Russian language in her belongings and decided to find her family to deliver the baby, she brings the diary home and ask her uncle Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski) to translate the document. Stepan refuses, but Anna finds a card of a restaurant owned by the Russian Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) inside the diary and she visits the old man trying to find a lead to contact Tatiana's family. When she mentions the existence of the diary, Semyon immediately offers to translate the document. However, Stepan translates part of the diary and Anna discovers that Semyon and his sick son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) had raped Tatiana when she was fourteen years old and forced her to work as prostitute in a brothel of their own. Further, Semyon is the dangerous boss of the Russian mafia ""Vory v Zakone"", jeopardizing the safety of Anna and her family. Meanwhile, Semyon's driver Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen) gets close to Kirill and Semyon, climbing positions in the criminal organization, but he helps Anna, her family and the baby.After ""A History of Violence"", David Cronenberg makes another engaging an d violent thriller with the excellent actor Viggo Mortensen. His character recalls the one he performed in the magnificent ""American Yakuza"" in the beginning of his successful career. After the Italian mobsters, Latin drug dealers and Yakuza, it seems that Russian Mafia and human trafficking are the present mobster organization and business explored by the cinema industry. In addition to the great direction of Cronenberg, the performances of Vincent Cassell and Armin Mueller-Stahl are top-notch and Naomi Watts is efficient as usual. In the end, ""Eatern Promises"" is a great entertainment. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Senhores do Crime"" (""Lords of the Crime"")",Eastern Promises
4,kosmasp,Holds his promise(s),9,9 July 2008,"After ""A History of violence"" Cronenberg teams up again with Viggo Mortensen. And Viggo goes Russian. Similar to the believable accent that Di Caprio had (learned) for Blood Diamond, Viggo is more than convincing playing eastern European ... With him the movie has a gravitas. Yes Naomi Watts might be the lead on paper, but it's Viggo who steals the show.And that's not only in one particular fight scene, which is more than a brave exercise for an actor (especially considering it's ""graphic"" nature, you'll understand once you've watched), but because of his general screen presence. Of course with a supporting cast like that (Cassel, Stahl), there's not much that can go wrong anyways. A generally slow moving action drama, with the action being delivered fast and brutal. Not for the faint hearted then, but which Cronenberg movie really is?",Eastern Promises
5,gavin6942,"Powerful Film, Most Unique For Cronenberg",7,22 June 2011,"A Russian teenager living in London who dies during childbirth leaves clues to a midwife (Naomi Watts) in her journal that could tie her child to a rape involving a violent Russian mob family.Going through David Cronenberg's films, this one is his most unlike the others. Shot outside of Canada (in London) about Russian gangs, it does not have the familiar ground of past films -- we could say his love of ""flesh"" is shown here in tattoos, but that would be stretch. The only thing connecting this to past work is a score by Howard Shore and costumes from Denise Cronenberg.Sure, one can say this is the companion piece to ""A History of Violence"", both starring Viggo Mortensen. And I would agree. But this film goes to the next level, taking the violence completely out of the horror realm (even ""Violence"" had some horror gore) and into the action genre. Mortensen also steps up his fighting ability, most notably in the nude brawl -- one scene I will never forget.Watts was not as powerful as Mortensen, but you have to give them both credit. The story is that both submerged themselves in the relevant culture -- Watts at a hospital and Mortensen in Russia. I do not speak Russian, but I was fooled -- I would think it was a native tongue for Mortensen.As a Cronenberg fan, this film tears me, but in a good way. As being far removed from his past work, I am saddened that the science fiction aspect is completely gone. Yet, the film is strong and a good contender for one of the best films of 2007. Cronenberg has moved to the mainstream, and he has done it in his own way. There is no shame in success if he has remained true to himself.",Eastern Promises
6,lee_eisenberg,David Cronenberg should know better than to use a cliché,6,5 January 2008,"I have always liked David Cronenberg as a director. ""Scanners"", ""The Fly"", ""Naked Lunch"", ""Crash"" and ""A History of Violence"" are truly one of a kind. So although ""Eastern Promises"" has a good premise and pulls no punches, the movie has a problem: it has long since become a cliché to portray Russians as gangsters. I know that we had the Cold War, but seriously. I've twice been to Russia and stayed in people's homes there, so I find it hard to view the place negatively. In fact, I secretly had a crush on my St. Petersburg host sister Marina (OK, I'll be totally candid: I still fantasize about her, and it arouses me to even think about her as I write about her). Why can't they just have American gangsters? I mean, we've had the mafia for years.Otherwise, it's worth seeing, although squeamish people should avoid it. Starring Viggo Mortensen, Naomi Watts and Armin Mueller-Stahl.",Eastern Promises
7,jboothmillard,Eastern Promises,6,28 February 2008,"I think the main reason I wanted to see this film from director David Cronenberg (The Fly, A History of Violence) was because the leading actor was nominated an Oscar, but besides that it is a good film. Basically Russian-born Nikolai Luzhin (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Viggo Mortensen) is a driver for one of London's most notorious organised crime families of Eastern European origin and the family is part of the Vory V Zakone criminal brotherhood. The main story sees North London hospital midwife Anna Khitrova (Naomi Watts) searching for the relatives of a teenage girl who has recently died giving birth to a baby, obviously the baby needs a home. The girl's diary is all Anna has to help her, and getting help from the head of the crime family Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) to translate the Russian language of the diary, she has accidentally released the full fury of the Vory. Nikolai however goes against the crime family and actually tries to help with Anna's enquiries, putting his own life danger. In the end, Anna raises the baby as her own, with her uncle Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski) and aunt, and Nikolai, after a big fight (in the nude) and kills, kisses her goodbye, and becomes the new crime boss. Also starring Vincent Cassel as Nikolai's brother, Kirill; Sinéad Cusack as Helen, Donald Sumpter as Yuri, Mina E. Mina as Azim and Tamer Hassan as Chechen. Mortensen is believable with his anti-hero ways and accent, Watts is compelling in certain moments, and Cronenberg directs rather well, definitely worth seeing. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best British Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score for Howard Shore. Good!",Eastern Promises
8,rmax304823,"Low-key, atmospheric crime drama.",6,7 October 2008,"David Cronenberg must be growing up. His early movies depended largely on the shock value of disgusting special effects. Watching them was like skimming through a medical text of skin diseases. Then he made ""Dead Ringers,"" which was vertigenously creepy without being revolting. And now ""Eastern Promises,"" which is a richly atmospheric story of the Russian mafia set in London. There are two or three scenes of violence, but mostly brief in their gore.The problem here is that Cronenberg has dispensed with much of the facile special effects but, unlike ""Dead Ringers"", there isn't a single dramatic trajectory to replace them. The characters and the status-sphere they inhabit are confusing.Well -- the story first. Naomi Watts is a London nurse who attends a birth at which the underage mother dies and the baby girl is saved. Watts finds a diary in the girl's purse, written in Russian, and her attempts to have it translated by a local restaurateur, Armin Mueller-Stahl, leads to some sticky business with the Russian mob. It seems the diary reveals that Mueller-Stahl's reckless son is the father of the baby, and has committed some other unsavory and illegal acts. Vigo Mortenson is the Russian go-between, with Watts on one side trying to save the baby, and the mob on the other, trying to cut the throat of anyone who is in a position to endanger the mob and its activities. It's an indication of the script's confused logic that it's never made clear just what these activities are -- something about smuggling something in television sets imported from Afghanistan. It's probably heroin, though no one mentions it.Watts and her story could easily have been written out of the script, leaving us with a quasi-mafia movie. The Russian gangsters all have complicated family ties, rival mobs, and traitors. They do a lot of fulsome eating in Russian-themed restaurants. (More Russian than the Russian Tea Room used to be.) They have ""made men,"" who wear multiple tattoos. The highest ranking capos have stars of loyalty tattooed over their hearts. The favored murder technique is the slit throat. There are three killings -- the last being a thoroughly brutal one between three men in a Spritzbad.Performances are pretty good. Naomi Watts is big-eyed and beautiful. Mortenson seems made of steel and speaks slowly and sparely, the way Robert DeNiro did in ""The Godfather II."" Armin Mueller-Stahl is miscast, in my expert and unimpeachable opinion. He's not a ruthless capo. He's somebody nice uncle who shows up with Christmas presents. About a third of the dialog is in Russian and the accents are passable, especially considering that none of the main players are Russian, but rather American of Danish descent, Welsh, German, French, and Polish. I don't claim this judgment is flawless but I believe my friend Julieta Vladimirovna would back me up on it. Or maybe she wouldn't. Let's not ask her.The pace of the movie is slow and deliberate, which doesn't help clear up any of the confusion. Much of the time, it rather sits there with the animation of a stuffed golupke. It's worth seeing because of the luscious texture, the settings, but probably not worth seeing twice.",Eastern Promises
9,Tweekums,Gripping thriller,9,20 July 2010,"Having heard good things about this film I had to see it when it was on television, while it isn't quite what I expected it was very good. I had expected an action film but it is far more restrained than that. While it might not be non-stop action it is tense throughout and in places it is shockingly violent. Set amongst the Russian Immigrants in London a nurse takes an interest in a baby whose teenaged mother died giving birth. She has the mother's diary but can't read it as it is in Russian, her uncle can read it but refuses to but there is a clue inside; a business card from a Russian restaurant. She goes there and the owner offers to translate it for her, unfortunately he is the last person she should trust it with as when he finds out what the diary contains her family is in danger. The restaurant owner's son is also having difficulties having murdered somebody who had been spreading rumours about him, with the help of his driver he has got rid of the body though. The driver appears to be ambitious and is soon trusted with the job of eliminating the nurse's uncle just in case he read the diary. This job leads to a promotion that turns out to have been less well intentioned than he thought.The story was gripping and had some nice twists that I have tried not to spoil. Viggo Mortensen was great in the role of the driver and Naomi Watts did a good job as the nurse. As mentioned before there are some fairly violent scenes including one where a naked Viggo Mortensen must fight for his life against two knife-wielding assassins, these scenes are fairly graphic so if you don't line the sight of blood you may squirm a bit. The only complaint I had about the film was the subtitles; much of the conversation was in Russian but the subtitles were very small and often white on a white background making them rather difficult to read.",Eastern Promises
10,Quinoa1984,"deep in rich characterizations, unpretentious in style, perfect performances, one of the year's best!",10,15 September 2007,"David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises takes on, in the broadest stroke, the Russian mafia. But it's not that broad, per-say, so much as it takes on the atmosphere of an organized crime family, of the terror that is just completely seething under the surface, and comes up like pus out of a boil when heated. The Russian underworld of London isn't too pretty, and rivalries are settled often with the slice of a throat by a shaving knife (as happens towards the beginning of the film, and later on in a graveyard, put to a splendid jump-cut to an accordion player), with the members initiated through specific tattoos on the torso and knees. And when the most unexpected happens, like a terrible rape/pregnancy/birth via a 14 year old girl, the repercussions could be even more severe than a murder rap. I loved getting immersed into the nature of the people, of the violence, the threat of it, the joys submerged with lots and lots of vodka (it could be a stereotype, but then what would a stereotype be if it weren't true in the ugliest form), and at the same time always outsiders to British society.It's an insulated world, where double-edged personalities are common, especially if a crime boss/father like Armin Mueller-Stahl's character Semyon and at one time he has to be kind and compassionate to those outside of the circle. Like Naomi Watts's midwife character, who first comes to him about this mystery baby and a girl's diary written in Russian. But there's always the sensation, even early on, that he's a lot more sinister, a lot more cruel and vicious than he would let on to any ""ordinary"" person, and this is all the more apparent in his quick outbursts against his son Kirill (Vincent Cassell). Kirill, of course, is like a lone black sheep of the family, who gets into trouble with other families, usually through killing somebody in all late hours of the night. Nikolai (Mortensen) is the driver/bodyguard/foot-soldier to Kirill and the rest of the family, and has a bond that goes beyond what Kirill has- he's really like a 'good' son, if anything at all, to Seymon. Some of the best scenes in any Cronenberg film are those that are filled with an unspoken tension, and understanding of the dynamics, when Nikolai settles a situation between Seymon and Kirill, or those subdued homo-erotic moments from Kirill to Nikolai.Many of those scenes, the whole story arc of Nikolai, is a truly compelling tale that soon reveals itself- and not to reveal too much here as to make it spoiling- as part of Cronenberg's aesthetic of the double-sided nature of a man, or the duality inherent in certain types. But suffice to say, it's one of the coolest examples, even if it might seem almost conventional at first, because of what Nikolai's future will come to following the fight he has in the steam-house. While we see the more emotional story of Anna who, like Nikolai, is an outsider who is put into a somewhat torn situation (albeit Nikolai, unlike Anna, is far more cunning, and as he says to her at one point he is a 'bad' guy), her side of the story is more of something to keep things moving along- the fate of the diary, the baby, the whole ball of wax of secrets surrounding the mother's death and so on. This is all still compelling, in sad voice-overs, but somehow Anna's side is more of a base-line to the saga of the Russian family, which is appropriate. Her ending, which seems tidied up on the surface, has an open-ending that feels almost TOO tidy- however if you're thinking that ambiguity is lacking, it actually nears up to what History of Violence offered in a 'what next' kind of query to the audience.As modern thrillers should be, as Cronenberg and his screenwriter knows, Eastern Promises is efficient, startling, and often as entertaining as the goofiest moments of any film by the director. Only here its in little moments of dialog (was Anna's uncle in the KGB...maybe not, but as an auxiliary?), not so much in outrageousness or super-gore. And yet it's also probably even more violent, if only in the suddenness, than History of Violence; the much hyped steam-room right with Mortensen fending off the two gangsters lives up to it, as it's as visceral as Oldboy's classic sequence, and with an energy and shock value that made everyone in the audience I saw it with yelp and cringe. But Cronenberg isn't simply going by shock value here- Eastern Promises is very strong as classic storytelling, and even better in the acting department. Mortensen is one of Cronenberg's very best male collaborator/stars, and here his work is, if anything, more subtle and textured than the last one (which is saying a lot of both director and actor); Mueller-Stahl gives maybe his best performance since the 80s, a sure Oscar contender if I've ever seen one; Watts is sublime in a role that requires her mostly to be uneasy around Russian mobsters and frightened by the fear all around the situation; Cassell is about as taut as can be imaginable, and at the same time projecting the pathetic subtext to Kirill's boasting masculinity and stupidity.If you're planning on seeing any crime movie this year- that isn't directed by the Coen brothers- and one that is atmospheric without hyper-stylization, and grips the intellect just as much as the emotions, Eastern Promises is it. In a career of some of the most challenging probes of men on the edge of sanity and/or reason, Cronenberg continues to strike where the iron is hot, or just not seen to even be considered grounds for striking at all.",Eastern Promises

15,hitchcockthelegend,Thieves By The Code.,8,19 April 2013,"Eastern Promises is directed by David Cronenberg and written by Steven Knight. It stars Viggo Mortensen, Naomi Watts, Vincent Cassel and Armin Mueller-Stahl. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Peter Suschitzky. When a Russian teenager dies in childbirth, midwife Anna Khitrova (Watts) tries to seek out any relatives so that the baby will not be put into the foster care system. Following leads written in the dead girl's harrowing diary, Anna is led to mysterious Russian chauffeur Nikolai Luzhin (Mortensen) and the underworld of the Russian Mafia. After the critical and box office success of A History of Violence in 2005, it was no surprise to see director Cronenberg and lead man Mortensen team up again for another violent thriller. Perhaps less surprising is that it's equally as great, more proof positive that even when the great director goes mainstream he's still making powder-keg cinema. Set in London, a seamy London at that, Eastern Promises takes a look at a criminal underworld thriving beneath the city's glossy veneer. This isn't about the rat-a-tat of machine guns, this is slow and methodical criminality, where all roads lead to pain and misery for anyone not in league with, or on the wrong side of, the Vory V Zakone. Cronenberg never lets the film go up a pace, which is absolutely to the film's benefit, even as violence is rendered, and body horror (hey this is Cronenberg after all) comes our way, it's cloaked in a controlled melancholy that just pulses with sinister beats. Steven Knight's screenplay has a few tricks up its sleeve, not only on revelation terms, but also thematically as loyalty and family dynamics come under the microscope. There's also strong themes of identity and sexuality, again these are things that appeal to the director and he deftly inserts them into his pot-boiling conundrum. While the moral questions that Eastern Promises asks, are not answered by the makers, it is us the audience left to ponder such moral quandaries. The look is terrific, steely neo-noir photography for city streets and scapes, pronounced reds and greens scorch the eyes in certain interiors, and muted cold colours adorn the screen for moments of murky doings. Of course tech credits are no good if the central acting performance is off form, but once again for Cronenberg, Mortensen comes up trumps with a clinical portrayal. He looks perfect physically, with his torso adorned with striking tattoos, but also his mannerisms are magnetic, effortlessly shifting between ruthless mob employee and sensitive humanitarian. He also has to play his cards close to his chest, and he does so with great skill, while his Russian accent holds superbly. Cronenberg and Mortensen researched the topic vigorously, and it shows. Elsewhere the other actors also provide colourful and emotionally smart portrayals. Watts is a bit short changed with the character as written, and it's an irk that it never gives the actress more meat to chew on. Yet she draws you into Anna's stoic belief system with ease and she does a rather ace British accent as well. Stahl is just terrifying, the embodiment of a Godfather figure prepared to enact unspeakable crimes while ensuring the codes of family and the mob are never tampered with. And on the outer edges, with a tricky characterisation that calls for quick shifts of temperament, is Cassel, the presence and a jumping-bean bouncing around Mortensen's calm assuredness. While in secondary support it's great to see Donald Sumpter used to good effect as the senior police officer in charge of investigations. From the early sight of blood splattering on the floor of a pharmacy, to a most brazen and astonishingly raw fight staged in a Turkish bath house, Eastern Promises is never dull or what you could term normal. And yet this is why Cronenberg is still one of the finest auteur directors out there, because Eastern Promises always plays out as frighteningly real. 8/10",Eastern Promises

In so doing, she gets mixed up with a Russian mob family, including its boss, Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), his sleazy son Kirill (Vincent Cassel), and Kirills' loyal chauffeur / muscle man Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen).Acclaimed Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg again delivers a film that is equal parts engrossing, interesting, and reasonably intelligent. Working from a screenplay by Steven Knight, he does an impressive job of immersing us in an exotic environment. The mood and the feel of the material are just right. Although Cronenberg unfortunately seems to have left his ""body horror"" era far behind by this point, there is some very effective violence here and there courtesy of Stephan Dupuis.The film travels far on the charisma of its leading man Mortensen, who is utterly convincing as this enigmatic character. But the whole cast is excellent, really. Watts is an appealing protagonist, Cassel is most amusing, and Mueller-Stahl is a treat as the aged, reserved mafia boss. Other sturdy contributions are made by Sinead Cusack and Jerzy Skolimowski as Annas' aunt and uncle, Tatiana Maslany (voice only), Mina E. Mina, and Donald Sumpter. Some of Mortensens' fans will be truly delighted to see him show off the goods in a key bath house sequence.Certain story twists, the location shooting, and the crisp photography all help to make this very fine entertainment. Cronenberg works alongside a few of his frequent collaborators: cinematographer Peter Suschitzky, production designer Carol Spier, editor Ronald Sanders, composer Howard Shore, and costume designer Denise Cronenberg (the directors' sister).Eight out of 10.",Eastern Promises
17,dbborroughs,Cold mechanical tale of the Russian mafia in England is hard to connect to,4,14 October 2007,"Story of a midwife who gets caught up in the fringes of the Russian mob when she attempts to track down the family of a baby when the 14 year old mother dies delivering the child.Well acted, great looking and made with a technical flair that will probably garner many awards comes years end. Unfortunately for me its also cold, distant and strangely un-involving; it took me two passes to get through (the first time I changed movies because it was clear early that the film just wasn't working for me.) Part of the problem is that the film feels mechanical. I can see how tab A was put into slot B and it was folded along line c. I never felt that the film or its characters were really alive. It seemed to be a bigger budgeted version of the classic ""indie"" film where if you do certain things you'll provoke certain reactions (and win certain awards). I'm a huge David Croneberg fan going back to Scanners (the point at which the name meant something, though I know I had seen The Brood and his other films) so while I don't find it odd that he's made a film thats cold and detached (many of his horror films are icy and clinical), I find it odd that he's made a film thats so detached as to be unable to connect with the audience. For me there is always something that connects you, but here there is nothing. For me its the extremely rare film from a master director that doesn't resonate with me as anything other than a misfire.I've been reading some reviews on the film since seeing it but I'm still flummoxed. There are discussions of deeper meanings and hidden layers, but I don't see them. The characters don't seem to be that well deep, Naomi Watts' midwife doesn't seem to be much beyond a woman in search for a surrogate child, while our mob boys are clearly not what they seem, which we know going in (how can you not know that the sweetness hides and poisoned interior). Even looking back from the conclusion of the film I'm left wondering where the more than meet the eye many people have spoken about is residing (certainly not in the plot ""twists"" which just drive the story).Don't get me wrong its not a bad movie. Its a well made one, but as a story its just okay. perhaps had it not been hyped I might have warmed to it, but the reviews have been such that I was expecting an assault on my senses that never came. I will give the film a deserved second (well third) chance, but I think that unless I suddenly find something to latch on to I will have to rate this as one of the director least interesting efforts.",Eastern Promises
18,Bunuel1976,"EASTERN PROMISES (David Cronenberg, 2007) ***",7,12 January 2008,"First of all, my *** rating is rather misleading because that’s how I also rated Cronenberg’s previous (and superior) film, A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE (2005) – in fact, my twin brother tried to talk me into giving this one a lower rating but I vetoed the idea; still, quite good, therefore, but not great – in view that the maverick director has apparently forsaken the horror genre for good and set his mind on becoming the successor to Martin Scorsese! In itself, the film is essentially well made but surprisingly cliché-ridden resulting in stereotyped characters and a predictable plot line.While none of the principal actors are Russians, the cast is generally excellent: Viggo Mortenson’s role is practically a reversal of the one he played in A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE (though, again, he was more impressive there) – even so, he is to be applauded for consenting to play the tense bath-house assault (the film’s undeniable highlight) fully unclothed – though one wonders what the rabid fans of THE LORD OF THE RINGS films think of him now!; Naomi Watts is fine as always and delivers perhaps the best performance in the film (in spite of the fact that her character isn’t really given much to do); Vincent Cassel, however, is positively annoying as the typically arrogant but ultimately inadequate offspring of a Mafia Godfather (incidentally, if he was such a wimp that his father had to show him how to make love to a woman – even if it happened to be a 14-year old girl – why does the father later be angered that his only son has been branded a “drunken queer”?); Armin Mueller-Stahl portrays the latter and he’s quite good as always – though his ruthless (even inhuman, in view of the revelation about the dead prostitute’s fate) crime lord – hiding under a deceptively innocuous exterior – is anything but a novel concept; Sinead Cusack (whom I’ve recently watched in her prime alongside Peter Sellers in Hoffman [1970]) appears as Watts’ mother – the actress is the wife of Jeremy Irons (who made DEAD RINGERS [1988] and M. BUTTERFLY [1993] for Cronenberg…but also MOONLIGHTING [1982], which was directed by Cusack’s co-star here, Jerzy Skolimowski!); the latter has a nice part as Watts’ effusive ex-secret agent uncle (he isn’t afraid to face the Mafia but his amusing fate virtually supplies the film’s lone respite from the prevailing gloominess). Incidentally, coming back to that nude fight scene, Skolimowski himself set one of his best films as a director, DEEP END (1970), in a London bath-house – now there’s a unique film, with a tragic finale one doesn’t see coming! To get back to the predictable elements in the film: the Russian gangsters pose as restaurant owners and, sure enough – in true GODFATHER-style – we are treated to a group of elderly Russian diners chanting the proverbial “Oci Ciornie”; the explicit throat-cutting sequence which effectively opens the film is virtually repeated halfway through (as if one needed an illustration of the age-old “an eye for an eye” code of ethics adhered to in underworld circles!); even the late reveal of Mortensen’s true identity is a much abused model and shouldn’t surprise anyone who read the earlier signs correctly – the sudden promotion of Mortensen from a lowly if trusted chauffeur/clean-up man (yet another oft-used characteristic) into a fully-fledged member of the Russian mafia solely for the purpose of being sold out by Mueller-Stahl while passed off as his son; Cassel humiliates Mortenson by ordering him to have sex with one of the girls as he watches on: the sheer fact that we’ve seen this type of behavior in boss-henchmen relationships many times before makes the graphic scene itself seem gratuitous, etc.Throughout the film, I was reminded of a very similar recent case (in the same genre, no less) where the sum of the undoubtedly good parts add up to a less than completely satisfactory whole – Sam Mendes’ ROAD TO PERDITION (2002)...",Eastern Promises
19,lastliberal,"He is no driver, he is the undertaker.",8,8 May 2008,"As Viggo Mortensen takes his character from A History of Violence to the next step, you can see the effort he put into the role by doing research before the film.

He is real and this performance is the apex of his career.That is not to take anything away from David Cronenberg, who had the good sense in using European actors who spoke both Russian and English to make the characters real. A stroke of genius.Vincent Cassel (Crimson Rivers, Hate) certainly is always enjoyable, and played the drunken son perfectly. Naomi Watts (King Kong) was better than I have ever seen her.

20,Boba_Fett1138,Second halve makes this a good watch.,7,12 December 2007,"Of course this is not a bad movie but it's just that the movie is nothing too remarkable and doesn't stand out on too many fields, compared to other genre movies. The first halve of the movie just wasn't always as good and interesting enough. It went on and on about the diary, which to me just wasn't the greatest or most compelling element of the story. The movie should had progressed faster and build up earlier to the clearly better second halve.In the second halve the twists and turns kick in. It's nothing too shocking but it just makes the movie a little bit more interesting to watch and gives the story as a whole also some more depth and feeling. In the second halve you get to understand all of the motivations, that were all still mainly clouded in the movie its first halve. In its second halve it also becomes all the more obvious that this is a Cronenberg movie. Some graphic action kicks in and things tend to get more dark.Cronenberg's tries hard to create a new genre within the crime movie-genre. A genre that takes a more subtle and realistic approach and is very character driven. Guess it's just not my type of thing, since I also didn't like ""A History of Violence"" as much as everyone else seemed to do, even though I certainly enjoyed and appreciated the movie, just as I do this one.Just give me back the 'old' David Cronenberg. I preferred the Cronenberg that made movies such as ""Videodrome"", ""The Fly"" and ""eXistenZ"". But he obviously now likes making this 'new' sort of crime movies, since this is his second attempt, right after ""A History of Violence"" and he has success with it, so why would he stop?The movie is also different because it's set in London. If you're being completely critical you could ask why? What does it add to the story? It isn't even made that clear through the images that the movie is set in London, because it doesn't show any of the famous well known landmarks. The only thing that basically gives it away are because the car's are driving on the 'wrong side of the road' and Naomi Watts talks in an English accent, that by the way just seem to come and go randomly. The movie could had just as good had been set in any standard American or Canadian town, in which Cronenberg previously shot all of his movies. For the atmosphere and story of the movie it seems to be totally insignificant and random that the movie is set in London. But well, this is something to ponder about if you're overly critical. It of course isn't something that distracts or downgrades the movie or its story.It's above all a character driven movie, with Viggo Mortensen as the lead man. He plays- and looks like such a different character then he normally does. Perhaps it's an Oscar worthy performance he is giving in this movie, although the probably went get further than just a nomination this year. The character within the movie are characters but above all also humans. They look and feel real. Even though they are not in some everyday situations, they still deal with it as 'normal' humans. Some people complain that Armin Mueller-Stahl and Vincent Cassel don't look and talk like Russian's but I have no problem with this. Especially Vincent Cassel fits his role right and it's also surprising to see Armin Mueller-Stahl for a change as a big crime-boss. I thought they did a really excellent job with the casting in this movie.It's a good watch as a sort of a different approach of the crime-genre but in the long run the movie is just nothing too remarkable or something that will life on for a long time in your memory-, to consider this movie one of the year's-, or Cronenberg's best.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Eastern Promises

Cronenberg pulls no punches as usual, and I'm thrilled to see him and Mortensen work together again. The former delving into sick and depraved behavior and types as we have come to expect him to do, and the latter delivering a nice and subtle performance(whilst oozing of charm). This is engaging and gripping right from the start, with a chilling plot. The characters are immensely well-written, psychologically accurate and entirely credible. Every role is well-acted; and I, for one, don't mind that these people are Westerners, in spite of what they're portraying. Quality before authenticity, I say. Also, apart from that, this looks, sounds and feels just like the real thing. The environment, and definitely the brutality of it, are utterly convincingly done. There is a lot of strong violence and disturbing content, as well as some sexuality, relatively infrequent language and a little nudity(including brief male full frontal) in this. The DVD contains two well-done, informative featurettes that are well worth your time. I recommend this to any fan of David and/or Viggo. 8/10",Eastern Promises

23,evanston_dad,"Cronenberg's Latest Feels Less Important Than ""A History of Violence""",7,1 October 2007,"I have a love/hate relationship with David Cronenberg, or maybe more aptly a like/hate relationship with him. I liked ""Naked Lunch"" and ""The Fly."" I hated ""Crash."" I loved ""A History of Violence,"" and on the strength of that film, and the fact that he was re-teaming with Viggo Mortensen, came into ""Eastern Promises"" with high hopes.So did I like ""Eastern Promises?"" Yes. Did I love it? No. It's the kind of movie that feels haunting while you're watching it, but it left me surprisingly unmoved after it was finished, and nothing about it really lingered in my head, which was not the case with ""Violence."" I think maybe the difference is that ""A History of Violence"" felt completely of a piece with the current cultural climate; it felt resonant. ""Eastern Promises"" tells a much more contained and, in my mind, contrived story that doesn't have much to say about anything outside of the world of the film. That's not to say that the film itself doesn't tell an interesting story, but I'm not sure it tells a very important one.Mortensen plays the driver of a Russian mafia crime boss (Armin Mueller-Stahl in a sinister, mesmerizing performance) who crosses paths with a young and pretty nurse (Naomi Watts) when she gains possession of a diary left behind by an immigrant prostitute who dies giving birth. Watts becomes the protector of the young girl's baby, for reasons of her own, and becomes obsessed with discovering the truth about the girl's death and holding those responsible for it accountable (""those"" happen to be the very Russian mafia that Mortensen works for). Stahl's attempts to ""deal"" with the situation are foiled unbeknownst to him by Mortensen, for reasons that we don't fully understand until the film's final moments.All of this sounds juicy enough, and at times the film is quite an effective little thriller, but on screen the whole story is just a little too scripted to ever be believable. I also thought Cronenberg resorted to cheap tricks at the end, when he puts a baby in danger to create a race-against-time finale; it felt desperate, like the product of a screenwriter who didn't know how else to end the movie. Watts is wasted in her role; her character's not especially vivid. Mortensen gives a very good performance, but his character's not as interesting as he first appears. The more we learn about him, the more we realize that any complexity given to his character is a result more of plot twists than of psychological motivation.Cronenberg brings a highly homoerotic charge to the film -- much of the film's action is driven by the fact that Stahl is embarrassed by his gay son, who isn't man enough for the role he needs to fill. And in the film's most memorable scene, a completely nude Mortensen fights savagely to the death in a Turkish bath. I commend Cronenberg for this scene -- in our movie culture, it's been completely acceptable for ages to juxtapose naked female flesh to violence, but when the same is done with a male body, people sit up and take notice.My biggest complaint with the film is Cronenberg's use of shock violence. Like so many violent films, this one makes us ask the question: at what point does graphic violence stop making a point and merely become a fetish of the director? Would the scene in the bath have been any less effective had it not ended with a close-up of Mortensen stabbing a man in the eye with his blade? Unfortunately, that appeared to the be the film's money shot, if the young college boys next to me whooping it up at that point were any indication. I just felt that moments like that cheapened the overall effect of the movie.So, Cronenberg didn't knock this one out of the park for me. It's definitely a movie I'm glad I saw, and it's bound to be a conversation starter, but I don't think it's a movie I'll remember as one of this year's best.Grade: B+",Eastern Promises

27,gradyharp,'Eastern Promises' Delivers!,10,25 December 2007,"EASTERN PROMISES as written by Steven Knight and directed by David Cronenberg is one of the grittiest, insightful, and well-acted films of the year. Maintaining his keen eye for the dark side of life and the people who dwell in its shadows, Cronenberg has once again brought us characters so strongly etched on film that they will be remembered for many years.The setting is London where lives the enigmatic Russian-born Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen in an Oscar caliber performance) who serves as a driver for a cloaked mysterious Russian family, members of the Russian mafia called the Vory V Zakone, a bizarre brotherhood populated with men whose lives of crime are told in tattooed stories on their bodies. The head of the family is the elegant restaurateur Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) whose son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) carries on the crime aspects of the family but shows no role of leadership in his dissipated life style. As the film opens we observe the birth of a little girl to a drug-addled mother Tatiana (Sarah-Jeanne Labrosse): she dies during childbirth having been delivered by a midwife Anna (Naomi Watts) who herself has a history of a stillborn child. Anna finds a diary in Tatiana's purse, saves it, and takes it to her uncle to translate it form the Russian. Opening the diary opens dark secrets for Semyon and Kirill: Tatiana was apparently one of the many illegal Russian prostitutes imported by the Vory V Zakone crime syndication and was raped by Semyon whose daughter was born as Tatiana died. Anna's investigation as to the baby's heritage includes the invaluable help of Nikolai who despite his past has a soft spot for Anna and her plight and it is the manner in which the interplay of Anna, Semyon, Kirill and Nikolai works out that brings the film to its conclusion.The acting is impeccable with Mortensen, Watts, Cassell, and Mueller-Stahl at peak form. Cameo roles by Sinéad Cusack and Jerzy Skolimowski, among others, are fully fleshed. The accents are believable and the multiple tattoos on Mortensen's body (seen fully in the much ballyhooed bathhouse scene, more about killing than about voyeurism) match the dark, dank atmosphere well captured by the cinematographer Peter Suschitzky and echoed with the musical score by Howard Shore. This is a tough movie for the squeamish to watch, but the story is superb and the film is Cronenberg at his best. Grady Harp",Eastern Promises
28,The_Void,"An excellent follow-up to the masterpiece, A History of Violence.",8,29 October 2007,"Normally I'd consider it a shame when a horror director breaks out of my favourite genre and starts making other types of films; but when that director is making films as good as Eastern Promises and 2005's A History of Violence, who can possibly complain? Cronenberg has never followed the mainstream, and while he didn't write this and A History of Violence himself, both films are still very anti-mainstream and it's not hard to see why he took on both projects. I didn't really think there was much room left for ingenuity in the crime genre; but by setting the film in London and putting the focus on the Russian Mafia, Cronenberg has found an area not often explored. The film focuses on the Vory V Zakone crime syndicate, and in particular a restaurant owning family headed by a man named Semyon. The story starts when a young girl dies during childbirth on a midwife named Anna's shift. Anna finds the diary of the deceased and it leads her to Semyon's restaurant. There, she is introduced to Semyon's bad son Kirill and a driver named Nikolia, and the diary turns out to be of great importance for the family.As you would probably expect, the film is professionally made and the production values are excellent; so I wont waste too much of this review going on about that. The most important thing about this film is the story, and it's carried off excellently. Full of double meanings, most of them surrounding retribution; it's a story that entertains on the surface and has enough depth for anyone wanting to look a little further into it. Eastern Promises is bolstered by an excellent performance from Viggo Mortensen. This actor has really impressed me, having surfaced as a result of Lord of the Rings; and Mortensen has proved himself as an actor capable of great performances during his two collaborations with David Cronenberg. He thoroughly convinces in this film, and it would be hard for anyone not already knowing that he's American to think that he is not Russian. Luckily, the film was passed uncut by the censors in the UK, and that is a very good thing as the brutal violence is one of the key elements, though it is never overused. The film kicks off with a bloody throat slitting, and the best sequence in the movie features Mortensen fighting in the nude with two rival gang members. The ending is the only thing that disappointed me; generally I think that ninety minutes is about the optimum running time for a film, but I'd have been happier for this one to go on twenty minutes longer and ended with more closure. Still, Eastern Promises is one of the first truly great films that I've seen this year and I'll be surprised if I see many better. A great achievement for everyone involved!",Eastern Promises
29,zetes,"Almost great movie, with great performances",8,23 September 2007,"Cronenberg follows up his critically (and I'm guessing financially) successful A History of Violence with another mob story, this time set amongst the Russian mafia in London. A midwife (Naomi Watts) delivers a baby to a dying Russian teenager. She takes her diary, in Russian, and tries to get it translated. Unfortunately, she walks straight into the people who were selling the teenager as a prostitute, a restaurateur (Armin Mueller-Stahl) whose business is merely a front. In reality, he's a mob boss. The mob boss's son (Vincent Cassel) has recently recruited his driver (Viggo Mortensen) into the mob. The story follows Mortensen, who becomes attracted to the midwife, while his bosses want her out of the picture.Cronenberg fans were mixed over A History of Violence. Many thought it was too mainstream. But it had a strange mood to it, and was definitely a stylized reality. That made it stand out from other films, in my opinion. I'm not sure I could fit it into Cronenberg's filmography very well, but, if I had seen it without knowing who directed it, I would certainly have known it was made by someone special. Eastern Promises, on the other hand, could easily have been made by pretty close to anyone else. Other than a couple of visceral moments, most notably the now infamous fight sequence that occurs late in the film  certainly one of the stand-out scenes of 2007  the film is directed in a straightforward manner.*SPOILERS in the next paragraph* Steve Knight, who was nominated for an Oscar for Dirty Pretty Things several years ago, has a very good script here. I especially like the way he gets us thinking about Vincent Cassel's sexuality before the possibility is even uttered by the characters (and it's never confirmed). But I honestly didn't like the big twist with Mortensen's character. Turns out he's an undercover operative for the police. Much like Cassel's sexuality, this is hinted a few times, very subtly (I didn't notice it, but probably because I didn't want the story to go that way). To me, this route is uninteresting. I liked Mortensen's thug character so much, I was disappointed when it was revealed to be untrue. In addition to this, I thought the film's wrap-up didn't make much sense. Mortensen's supposed to be dead. While Mueller-Stahl is sent to prison, I don't quite believe Mortensen would be able to re-enter that society. Mueller-Stahl doesn't seem to be at the top of the Russian mafia, but he seems to be high enough up it where someone he decided to kill wouldn't last very long, even with Mueller-Stahl out of the picture.*END SPOILERS* All in all, I do think Eastern Promises is a very good picture, pretty close to being a great one. While the script has a couple of weaknesses, overall it's quite good. And the acting is through the roof. Mortensen, Cassel and Mueller-Stahl are all award-worthy. I don't think any of their chances are that great, though, for an Oscar nomination.",Eastern Promises

31,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Eastern Promises,8,30 December 2007,"David Cronenberg's previous offering, A History of Violence, was hailed by many as a work of genius and made it to the mainstream paper's top movie of 2005. But I thought the original story in the graphic novel form was far superior, as he injected his own take for the second half of the film, which earned William Hurt an Academy Award nomination for his role as a gangland boss. Those in tuned with Cronenberg's works will know that his movies are usually warped in certain ways, but with A History of Violence, and now Eastern Promises, it seemed that they have become easier to grasp, and perhaps even more mainstream in its appeal.In some ways, Eastern Promises is like a watered down version of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece The Godfather. Set in London and involving the Russian mob, an organized crime family headed by Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) runs a restaurant front, while engaging in illicit activities from drugs to prostitution. Like Don Corleone, Semyon too has a hotheaded, impulsive yet inept son in the vein of Kirill, played by Vincent Cassel, in a role with suspect sexual orientation with his chumminess with Viggo Mortensen's Nikolai, who provides protection of sorts as their trusted underling, an enforcer type character for every crime family.Embroiled unwittingly into the crime underworld is Naomi Watts' Anna, a midwife who delivers a baby from a dead teen, whose diary she finds and becomes incriminating evidence on Semyon's activities, as her amateurish sleuthing brings her straight into the lion's den. Thereafter the movie takes two arcs, one involving the retrieval of the diary, which provided some background story to the mysterious girl and her plight, reminiscent of movies like Lilya 4-ever and Your Name is Justine, while on the other arc, the crime syndicate stuff proper, with deadly betrayals, revenge and deceit. Who says there should be honour amongst thieves, especially when it involves blood?While Watts' arc and character get reduced to supporting status, what makes a winner here is Mortensen's portrayal as the mysterious man of few words. Mortensen reunites with Cronenberg from their earlier collaboration, and his character's cool, calm and measured in his responses, a stark contrast to Kirill, and is no wonder the favourite ""son"" of Semyon as he knows is the man with the plan. Of interest here is how tattoos also play an important role with rituals in the initiation rites into the Family, and it's not just the Yakuza who boast these body art. As one character puts it, the tattoos on your body tell your whole story, so they command a great deal of respect.Cronenberg continues the tradition of showing unflinching bloody violence, so in your face that you'll probably be numb to it all by the time the much talked about public baths scene comes rolling along. While Mortensen and Maria Bello performed bedroom gymnastics that required her to bear all, it's Mortensen's turn here to be in the buff as he engages in a no holds barred fisticuffs. A relatively short sequence, but one which proved pivotal in turning the story over its head. Some might hate this turn of events as it reeks like a copycat of the multitude of Hong Kong crime movies, and might even be seen as a cop out, but I thought it still made decent plot development, and well worth it for the final shot in the movie, which seemed so ironic.Eastern Promises is still a highly watchable movie despite, as I mentioned earlier, Cronenberg's films having more mainstream appeal now, so don't go looking out for major shock and awe. While about half the dialogue is in Russian, I can't help but to close my eyes and imagine that Mortensen is speaking Elvish, while the rest of the cast have marbles in their mouths. Fans of Mortensen will probably not want to miss this (well, besides watching him perform in the buff), with him as a character sharing the same amount of intensity as his earlier role in A History of Violence.",Eastern Promises
32,Mr-Fusion,"I'm leery on Cronenberg, but this was fascinating",7,21 January 2016,"You can't mention ""Eastern Promises"" without also bringing up Viggo Mortensen, whom, in a movie full of great acting, leads the pack. That Russian accent couldn't have been easy to master, yet he wears it like a tailored suit. And he's so restrained composed in this role - you know he's a scary bastard, but he never raises his voice. And get a load of the mundane look on his face as he snips a corpse's fingers for disposal.Aside from the sporadic bouts of violence (particularly the brutal bathhouse fight scene), the movie is largely as quiet as its star. Especially for a seedy gangster movie. And despite the dark undercurrent flowing throughout, there's a sweetness at the movie's end that seems life-affirming in the face of all of this grisly death. Just as it is seemingly damning.I guess I didn't know what to expect with this, but it sucked me right in.7/10",Eastern Promises
33,christopher-underwood,more interesting than thrilling,6,11 July 2008,"Unlike many people I find this a rather disappointing Cronenberg. I find it more interesting than thrilling but the biggest thing this film lacks is the horrible insidious under the skin element that almost all his other films have. It certainly has it's moments and the dark wet London streets and the bath house fight are probably the best. Viggo Mortensen is most effective as 'the driver' and Naomi Watts just about holds her part together. She has quite a task, however, as she is so unbelievable in that she would act towards the Russians in the way she does and also that she alone seems to be negotiating on the baby's fate without so much as a nod to the hospital authorities. For those who enjoy gangland thrillers and prefer their violence to be all on the surface then you may thrill to this downbeat tale of goodies and baddies. Good to see vintage Polish director, Jerzy Skolimowski, though and thanks to IMDb I'm pleased to discover he is 70 and still working on both sides of the camera.",Eastern Promises
34,siderite,"Good movie, but not terribly engaging",8,4 February 2008,"A movie about the Russian mob in London could have gone in a number of ways, but this one took the observer approach. You see things how they happen and you draw your own conclusions. There is some plot, of course, but nothing most people can easily identify with.I found it funny that the Russians were a New Yorker named Viggo Mortensen, a Frenchman named Vincent Cassel and a German called Armin Mueller-Stahl. Well, at least the last one was born German, but his home town is now part of Russia :)The film is a Viggo show, actually. He plays really well as the loyal Ukranian mobster who has some skeletons in his closet. He even manages a few convincing ""Da""s. Naomi Watts plays the nosy medical nurse stuck with a child whose Russian speaking mother died on her watch without revealing her name. She follows the girl's diary and manages to get tangled up in a Russian underworld intrigue.Overall this is a very well done movie. The pace is slow, but the tension is high and masterfully crafted. However, it wasn't a memorable film, either. Maybe it was my inability to relate to a woman concerned with a child or to a mobster with a conscience.",Eastern Promises

36,Smells_Like_Cheese,A truly incredible film,10,29 December 2007,"Eastern Promises is another big talker for the Oscars and golden globes, I wasn't interested at first, but after hearing such excellent reviews, I am so grateful that I listened to them. Eastern Promies is one of the best films of the year, and honestly, I would say it's one of the best films in this century. The performances were just absolutely flawless, both Vigoo and Naomi were perfect choices and their performances were beyond incredible. Not to mention the rest of the cast, I just cannot pick a favorite. Another thing that made this film terrific was the lighting and settings, David Cronenberg is such an amazing director. There was a shot in particular that I thought was so beautiful, with the prostitute that Viggo sleeps with and she's lying on the bed singing was so hypnotic and heart breaking, just captures the terror she's probably been through in the business. The story is a memorable one that is up to Godfather standards.Anna is just a nurse in London, when her hospital comes across a 14 year old who is pregnant and gives a premature birth, she dies, but the baby lives. The girl has left a diary of her life and how she became pregnant and by whom, going deep into the dark world of the Russian mafia in London. Anna is determined to find out what happened to her and talks to the godfather who is accused of raping the girl. Nikolai is a ""driver"" for the Russian mafia, he is being pressured to be more tough, but deep down, he knows what the right thing is to do and after a horrible set up, he realizes the dark world he is in and wants to help Anna.Eastern Promises was just a flawless film, there was absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. I really hope that the Oscars recognize it's creditability, it's a classic for mob movies and a new favorite of mine. Viggo was just so amazing, his scene where he is telling the mob bosses of his history of crime was absolutely perfect and dead on. His story was so heart breaking when you really think about it and just the horrible life he has had to led to be accepted. Anna, played by Naomi, she just truly captured my heart in trying to save this baby's life and find out the story behind her mother's tragic life. Eastern Promises is a film not to be missed, it's a perfect film.10/10",Eastern Promises
37,blanbrn,One of the better mob films that's brutal and well mapped out with interest and intrigue that makes the viewer think.,8,18 February 2008,"""Eastern Promises"" isn't the best mob movie ever made, but certainly not the worst either. It's plenty bloody, violent, and it has enough drama and intrigue and mystery to make it a winner and a must watch for any viewer. It centers around a Russian mob family ran by Semyon(Armin-Stahl)and his son Kirill(Vincent Cassel)who along with their tough and ruthless sidekick Nikolai(Viggo Mortensen) dominate the underworld. In the films start when a 14 year old girl turns up murdered and after delivering a baby and when a little diary turns up a mystery of suspense and drama intrigue starts up. The evidence is uncovered by a hospital midwife Anna(Naomi Watts)only soon her path crosses with the family to set off a chain off odd events and the search for the truth. Enough drama is present to make the viewer think about what's next in the plot to the end. And like most all mob dramas the violence and blood is grade A and Viggo Mortensen and Naomi Watts gave excellent performances as both were tough and poured their soul into the effort. Overall ""Eastern Promises"" is one of 2007's best it has all the good themes and elements that make a movie an interesting watch and winner.",Eastern Promises
38,KineticSeoul,"Like USA Today says it's ""provocative and engrossing"".",8,16 November 2009,"Eastern promises is basically about the Russian mob in London. Where the criminal mastermind Nikolai(Viggo Mortensen) who is also charismatic and mesmerizing, Viggo did a fine doing his research in order to portray his character anyways he finds his ties to a notorious crime family. One of the main boss who he is working for is Semyon(Armin Mueller-Stahl) who I thought was perfect in this role, his character is charming, intelligent and yet ominous. The boss's son who Nikolai also works for or sort of his partner in crime is Kirill(Vincent Cassel) who also did a good job with his role while playing the incompetent son. Nikolai is shaken when he crosses paths with Anna(Naomi Watts), a midwife who has accidentally uncovered evidence against the crime family. Through a accidental prostitute, There is a lot of Eastern European prostitutes in London which ain't saying much since it's the oldest job in history. And like one of Nikolai's quote ""slaves give birth to slaves"". And she does not know the depth of danger to what she is digging into. The Russian crime family that goes by ""Thief in Law"" has a unwritten code of behavior and if you break the code your out, in another words dead. This is not a love story in the traditional sense, but there is a chemistry between Nikolai and Anna that plays sort of a big role. The main highlight for me about this film is the metaphorical pivot with the tattoos, which has to tell the truth in order to be trusted in the crime family and plays a big part in the movie and they usually don't have to do with religion, although it may seem to be. The cross on Nikolai's chest means thief in good standing, the church with the 3 domes in his back means that he served 3 prison sentences, the spider crawling up his back means he will continue to climb in crime and more. The tattoos can't be deceptive and has to tell who you are, and that was interesting. This could have been a common crime story but the direction David Cronenberg went with this made it unique and memorable, since it was really engaging and all. If your into mobster movies, I highly recommend you check this one out.8.6/10",Eastern Promises
39,Buddy-51,A Promise Largely Fulfilled,7,17 January 2008,"For most of his career, cinema maverick David Cronenberg has been content to make films on the far-off, outer margins of the commercial mainstream. It's only natural then that he would one day feel the need to come in from the cold (at least for awhile) and get a taste of what life is like for those on the inside. He began that effort a few years back with ""A History of Violence,"" a fairly straightforward movie that earned him a measure of success at the box office and a great deal of respect from both the critical establishment and his fellow directors. Now, he continues the mainstreaming process with ""Eastern Promises,"" a riveting but largely conventional crime drama that serves as a showcase for a half-a-dozen or so brilliant performances. And if the movie feels as if it is lacking in the kind of originality, passion and uniqueness of vision we've come to expect from Cronenberg, well, there are certainly enough compensatory virtues to make the film very much worth seeing, Set in London, the movie takes us into the dark, frightening underworld of the Russian mafia. Viggo Mortensen plays Nikolai Luzhin, a recent Russian immigrant working as a chauffeur for a mob boss who uses the respectability of a high-end restaurant as a cover for his nefarious deeds. Naomi Watts co-stars as Anna, a local midwife who stumbles upon the diary of a 14-year old girl who has just died in childbirth, a diary that could implicate the old man on charges of rape, drug-dealing and child endangerment. This knowledge puts Anna's life and the lives of her family at risk, so the question becomes will Nikolai side with his boss or with this innocent woman who is, ever so slowly, finding her way into his heart.In ""Eastern Promises,"" Cronenberg abandons the over-the-top, absurdist elements that used to define the director's work, and settles for a more straightforward approach instead. That is not meant to in any way denigrate the movie, for it is an intriguing tale that isn't afraid to take its time unraveling its story. Cronenberg maintains a surprisingly low-keyed tone throughout, confident that tension can sometimes be achieved more effectively through understatement than through hyperbole. Steve Knight's dialogue is flavorful and pungent, and he is blessed with a first-rate cast who clearly knows how to deliver the lines he's written. Mortensen, sporting a thick Russian accent, creates a menacing presence through his sturdy demeanor and stoic expression. Yet, he allows glimmers of tenderness to occasionally seep out from the edges of his half-smile or the center of his piercing eyes. Armin Mueller-Stahl provides a similarly discomfiting mixture of grandfatherly gentleness and steely-eyed ruthlessness as the Old World mob boss who is anything but the benign, kindly restaurateur he portrays himself as being. Vincent Cassell as his overcompensating son, Naomi Watts as the compassionate Anna, and Sinead Cusack and Jerzy Skolimowski as Anna's concerned mother and uncle all deliver compelling, memorable performances.Thus, even though I prefer Cronenberg when he's stirring up trouble way out there on the fringe in cutting-edge movies such as ""Crash"" or ""Spider,"" there are still many good reasons for checking out ""Eastern Promises.""",Eastern Promises
40,thesar-2,Eastbound and Up,8,2 April 2014,"Okay, here goes. Despite being a fan of Viggo Mortensen and Naomi Watts, of the genre/style and already wanting to see this movie, I somehow missed it for many years until recently. Of course, the push for me was that scene. You know the shower fight.Actually, that's not what got me to finally watch Eastern Promises. A friend of mine was leaving our work for good and the last week there, she had received back her DVD copy of this from another coworker she had lent it out to. I showed a little bit of interest – especially telling her of my desire to see the shower scene and she made me, ah-hem, promise to bring it back before she quit. I borrowed it, watched it and returned it. Good boy, I am.I digress. This was a fairly good, interesting and fun (for fans of the suspenseful, sometimes slow, but always tight genre) film to watch. Never let me down and for about 100 minutes, it was a worthy watch.The Russian mob in London's not too pleased with midwife Watts after she becomes ""involved"" with their driver and she has a diary of someone who could implicate them in horrible crime(s.)Now, that's the gist and there are more layers. But, not too many, that is. While very good, it wasn't the greatest thriller I've seen. It is, however, worth another viewing sometime down the road. You see, sadly, I'm finally given a chance to sit down and write out my thoughts – it's been just about a month and a half since I've seen this.In that time frame, I've forgotten the majority of the movie and had to even watch the trailer online before beginning this review. Thisis not a bad thing. I know I liked it a lot and I know I will give it another shot later on. To me, it will be even more enjoyable the second time around because I probably will have forgotten everything by that point and it will be like my first time seeing it.Okay, almost everything. I still have that entire shower scene in my head. I am still a man, after all.* * * Final thoughts: (SPOILER, sorta) Sadly, while it's not a long movie, I did have to wait until the 100-minute movie nearly finished before getting to THAT scene. Which is a distraction because I was always anticipating it to come, but it will be better upon future viewingsAt least, I know when to expect it and then I can dive into the film up to that point even more.",Eastern Promises
41,sol-kay,Do you always rob the bodies of the dead?,7,29 May 2008,"***SPOILER ALERT*** The movie ""Eastern Promises"" starts off with what seems like two different story lines. We first see this barber later to be identified as Uncle Azim, Mina E. Mina, cutting a customer's hair. In pops Uncle's Azim's either drug addicted or semi-retarded, or both, nephew Ekrem, Jose Altin, looking like something that even the cat won't bother to drag in. Before we in the audience can figure out what exactly is going on Ekrem is given a straight-edge razor and, egged on by his Uncle Azim, proceeds to slash the unsuspecting customer's throat to the point where he practically decapitates him!As you try to digest why the poor guy got such a very close and bloody shave, was it that he didn't tip enough?, by both Uncle Azim and his nephew we see this young girl enter a pharmacy asking for help. Before we know it she, Titiana played by Sara-Jenne Labrosse, collapses in a pool of blood as she suddenly goes into labor. Dying while giving birth to her daughter, later named Christina, the hospital worker who treated Titiana Anna Khitrova, Naomi Watts,looks over the dead girl's belongings and finds a diary as well as a business card from the Russian Trans-Siberian Restaurant in London. Looking to track down Titiana's next of kin Anna asks her both Russian mother Helen, Sinead Cusack, and Step-father Stephan, Jerzy Skolimowski, to interpret the diary into English only to be told to forget about the whole thing! There are curtain things in the diary that can cost someone's life if the person whom there about finds out in it knows about him or her!It's when Anna goes to the Trans-Siberian Restaurant to see the owner Semyon, Armin-Mueller-Stahl, about Titiana's connection, if any, that the two bloody events, the murder at Uncle Azim's barber shop and Titiana's death, are suddenly tied together.It turns out that Semyon is a top honcho in the Russian Mafia known in Russian as the dreaded Organizatsiya. It also turn out that Uncle Azim's, together with his nephew Ekrem, murder of the person, a Russian hood named Soyka (Aleksandar Mikic), at the beginning of the movie was a hit-job that he was ordered to do for his boss who turned out out be non other then Semyon himself!As Anna gets more involved in finding the late Titiana's relatives she gets deeper and deeper involved with not only Semyon but his nutty but dangerous son Kirill, Vncent Cassel, and Krill's personal bodyguard and driver Nikolai, Viggo Mortensen. ***SPOILERS****By the end of the movie we not only get to find out the cause of both Titiana's death and pregnancy but just who the mysterious and deadly Nokilai, who's a lot more then what he at first seemed, really is!Even though the violence is kept very scarce by director David Cronenberg when it does happens it shocks the living hell out of you. Besides the gory scene at Uncle Azim's barber shop, and an equally shocking one later at a London cemetery, there's a knife fight at a local Turkish bathhouse that has to rank as one he most exciting and at the same time disturbing fight scenes in motion picture history. Nikolia, with nothing on but his tattoos, is attacked by these two Chechen hit-men as he's peacefully relaxing in the steam-bath. By the time the fight is over the two hoods are left not only dead but practically gutted by Nikolai who himself is on the verge of death, after getting stabbed about a dozen times, from loss of blood.The film takes a while to get to the core of it's story but when it does it becomes evident why Semyor and his son Kirill were so interested in getting their hands on Titiana's secret diary. What that diary reviled was not only enough to put Semyor's crime empire out of business but put Semyor himself behind bars for the rest of his life!",Eastern Promises
42,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A great story and a real eye opener into the immigrant underworld in London,9,2 April 2008,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A man is executed gangland style in a barber's shop in London and mobsters Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen) and Kirill (Vincent Cassel) are assigned the task of getting rid of the body. Meanwhile, a girl goes into a shop bleeding heavily and dies after being rushed to hospital to give birth. The midwife who helped her Anna (Naomi Watts) finds a diary where she records her harrowing journey from her native land to London and how the father of her baby raped her. The lives of these three people are about to collide in an unthinkable and deadly way. Meanwhile, the criminal organization Nikolai and Kirill work for all have to be on their guard as the murdered man's brothers come looking for revenge.We read in the papers every single day lately about mass immigration in Britain and how foreigners seem to be out-ranking native British citizens as we lose control of our borders completely. And of course, we cannot ignore the criminal underworld the less desirable faction have set up, which has been allowed to fester in London. It is this that Eastern Promises casts a brutal and unflinching look into, telling a gripping and exciting story that doesn't hold back from showing the sordid reality of the problem in all it's nitty gritty. And all at just over an hour and a half! Director David Cronenberg and Midland writer (yay!) Steven Knight have crafted an ingenious story that will really open your eyes.Another high-point must also be the performances, which are excellent all round. Mortensen is great as the controlled, disciplined soldier of crime Nikolai, while Cassel goes from one extreme to the other as the callous, reckless wildchild Kirill. And Watts is also brilliant as the feisty, noble nurse determined to stand up to the villains and see the right outcome to the situation. And with other support, such as Armin Mueller Stahl as the Marlon Brando style Godfather of the crime family, things can only get better.Highly recommended all round. ****",Eastern Promises
43,MOscarbradley,"Cronenberg's disappointing follow up to ""A History of Violence""",7,31 October 2007,"David Cronenberg's disappointing follow up to ""A History of Violence"" veers uneasily between viciousness and sentimentality but is finally redeemed by a magnificent performance from Viggo Mortensen as Nikolai, driver and fixer for Armin Mueller-Stahl's Russian godfather. (Mueller-Stahl is equally good; these are Oscar-calibre performances).Set in an almost unrecognizable London, (Cronenberg doesn't go in for conventional landmarks), the film moves from cliché-ridden incident to cliché-ridden incident until finally it pulls the rug from under us with a somewhat neat twist. Unfortunately the main story of a mid-wife trying to track down the family of a girl who has died in childbirth leaving behind, not just her baby, but a diary that links her directly to the Russian mafia, never generates enough excitement to keep us interested and the usually reliable Naomi Watts gives a dull performance. It's up to Mortensen, Mueller-Stahl and a suitably over-the-top Vincent Cassel to keep the octane levels up. The best scene and the one which is, I suppose, the most typically Cronenberg finds a totally naked Mortensen fighting off a couple of hit men in the Finsbury baths.It's not a bad film but it's intellectually shallow and formulaic, lifted as I've said by a couple of terrific performances. The ending, on the other hand, manages to be both upbeat and downbeat almost simultaneously.",Eastern Promises
44,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"A film about violence, family, loyalty, betrayal and deceit, 'Eastern Promises' is a very good film that gets better after the first viewing.",7,16 June 2016,"In some ways the spiritual successor to David Cronenberg's previous film 'A History Of Violence', 'Eastern Promises' deals with themes of violence, family, loyalty, betrayal and deceit. This sub-text is handled subtly, despite being rich and begging to be unravelled; it never becomes heavy-handed or detracts from the overall enjoyment of the film. Indeed, both Cronenberg and Steven Knight (the writer) ask questions that are never answered: either because the film wants you to decide, or because a definitive answer is literally impossible. The film lingers with you long after it is over, and a genuinely unexpected surprise makes you want to watch it all over again with fresh eyes.The movie is incredibly realistic, accurately portraying both London's Russian mob and the violent acts they commit. Speaking of which, the violence - while infrequent - is shocking and grizzly: it isn't exaggerated or understated, filmed in an expert manner which makes you almost feel as though you're the one being attacked. A gruelling fight scene later in the film proves this, allowing you to feel like you are really there. You're never sure what is going to happen; characters often hide their true intentions and none of them are ever given a safety net. The performances here are all top-notch, particularly that of Viggo Mortenson and Armin Mueller-Stahl - the former playing a 'driver' for the mob, always inching closer to becoming part of the family, and the latter playing the leader. Mortenson is especially impressive, perfectly carrying himself and speaking with a convincing accent - you could easily mistake him for actually being Russian. All of the accents are pretty good, although Vincent Cassel does sound decidedly French, and no-one gives a bad or unconvincing performance.The story as a whole is pretty small in scope, beginning with the audience in place of Naomi Watts' character - only seeing glimpses of the mob from the outside - before we slowly change perspectives to follow Viggo Mortenson's character - who works his way into the family, and brings the viewer with him. I was compelled throughout the narrative and, though it seemed to loose focus somewhat, thought that it concluded naturally. The ending doesn't truly feel like an ending, with life seeming to continue. Not much has actually changed, though things have been revealed and characters have certainly gone through their arcs. I think that the film ends when it does because the audience has transferred back to following Watts' character and the final scene is the last time she encounters the strange world of the mob. It also wraps up the story involving the baby, who is essentially the driving force of the movie.'Eastern Promises' is a film that lingers on long after the credits have rolled, one that leaves an after-taste which makes it hard to resist revisiting. It becomes infinitely more complex after the first viewing alone. Each character is well-written, with hidden motives and personality traits seamlessly woven into their every action: almost all of them act a certain way to mask their true intentions or desires, and these are hinted at through brilliant acting and an amazing script. The direction is fantastic too, with smooth camera work that effortlessly frames all of the action and several hidden long takes. No cut feels jarring, and at no point was I pulled out of the story to be reminded it is only a film; it had me hooked from beginning to end. Even though it sometimes seems to be going nowhere, after the first viewing everything falls into place.I think this is a very good movie, one that is perhaps underrated and not talked about nearly enough, that features an excellent cast and lead performance; it is expertly written and directed perfectly. 7/10.",Eastern Promises
45,ThomasDrufke,Relentless Violence,8,26 April 2015,"There are violent movies, and then there are movies like Eastern Promises. It brings an unbelievable amount of shocking violence with relentless momentum. I wasn't a huge fan of David Cronenberg's 'A History of Violence', but I found Eastern Promises to be a much more intriguing and well directed thriller.The opening throat slash gives you an idea of the type of film you are going to get. This is also one of Cronenberg's easier films to understand. I haven't seen Maps to the Stars or Videodrome, but I have heard they are very cerebral and surreal. I definitely appreciate his ability to entertain both our eyes and our brains. I found Eastern Promises to be fascinating as to just how nonchalant these people are when killing. For the most part, it's just another job. That is of course, minus Viggo Mortensen, who is the driver for the Russian mob family. Being the main protagonist, we find out there is much more to him than previously thought. I will say I thought the dynamic between Vincent Cassel and Viggo was entertaining and seemed a lot like the Phoenix-Crowe dynamic from the first 20 minutes of Gladiator.We then have Naomi Watts, a midwife stuck in the middle of this mob related chaos. I always love Watts in every role and this was nothing different. I think it's her ability to show so much strength and at the same time a lot of vulnerability. It's something only a few actors can do. Overall, Eastern Promises proves to be an entertaining and disturbing thriller. It's a very well rounded film.+Viggo & Vincent's dynamic +Watts +Eerie feel +More than just throat slashes 8.0/10",Eastern Promises

If you don't care for gory realistic violence than you probably won't sit through the whole film. The movie begins in a shocking way when a man's throat is slashed. It's especially graphic because the sawing motion is shown and it looks realistic.A young girl dies at the hospital after giving birth. The midwife who delivered the baby wants to find the girl's family to give the child to. Her search leads her to a Russian restaurant where she unknowingly becomes involved with the Russian mob. She mentions a diary the girl had written in Russian and wants the Restaurant owner, who is the boss, to translate. He knows there may be secrets in that diary so wants it back.His son, Kirill, was the one responsible for the hit and did it without his father's permission. This means the other mob family wants revenge. Kirill's driver, Nikoli, is the other main character. He gets his mob tattoo stars and is set up by the boss in hopes of protecting his son.The end of the film contains one of the most intense, gruesome fight scenes ever. It's definitely what this movie will be remembered for. Nikoli is involved in a nude fight scene in a bath that ends with lots of blood.

These movies would be great to watch back-to-back.Overall, this is an excellent film. However, the ending of the film left me wanting more to the film. I also like the tattoos that are displayed on the bodies of the Russians to show what kind of character they are. I rate this film 9/10.",Eastern Promises
48,tabuno,One Great Movie,9,21 January 2019,"30 September 2007. A relatively simple story told in an amazingly unassuming way, with great performances (never over the top), with a decent twist, and a decent ending all make for one of the best movies of the year. Viggo Mortensen continues his strong performances from A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE (2005), along with convincing performances from Naomi Watts, Armin Mueller-Stahl, and even an outstanding supporting role from Vincent Cassel. A fight scene near the end is one of the most riveting, obviously clumsy scenes making it one of the compelling scenes for its primal, rip-gutting fight for survival shots by director David Cronenberg who brings all of his talent of one of his horror genre with him (a clear sign of a good director). The movie begins with a shocking scene and ends with a tender one, allowing the audience to realize that something important happened in this movie. Easily open for film award nominations of some kind - but is it too far out of the box cinema for the major awards? Nine out of Ten Stars.",Eastern Promises

Mortensen is terrific as a man who's ""just a driver"" for an organized crime family, but is forced into a difficult situation when a midwife becomes involved with the family. Watts is quite good as the strong-willed midwife while Mueller-Stahl brings Godfather-like authority to the role of the tough crime boss. Cronenberg maintains the intensity throughout although the ending is a bit anti-climactic. The only negative aspect is the director's trademark gratuitous violence, particularly in the throat-slashing scenes.",Eastern Promises

51,Dr_Coulardeau,The only way out is underground,10,18 September 2010,"A horror film that is just a plain true slice of Russian gore, as we can see it everyday in our European democracies. Prostitution, essentially of girls under age, drugs essentially as the fodder of the prostituted girls, alcoholism, violence, crime, any kind of trafficking provided it pays. The absolute impotence of the police or any authorities to stop it or prevent it is fascinating, and we may even think the absence of desire to do anything on their side might be a sign of fear. These networks of underground criminal organizations can only be endangered from the inside and the only who can get into these networks are Russians working for the ex-KGB. And that's the whole film. How does a KGB mole infiltrate such a network? The answer is slowly and the second answer is with a little bit of blood, shed by the English police if possible, I mean blood from the Russian criminals not of course blood from the English police. The film is full of suspense but without any suspense really because we know who is who, even if the people in the film do not know who is who. The suspense is in the details of the tricks, of the treachery, of the gore and of the horror each crime creates and calls for. The Chechens are sure seen as barbaric monsters but the Russians are not really better except that they do speak, and not only Russian. The end is a fairy tale because it is the victory of the good within the camp of the bad. It is Jesus becoming the head of the Roman Legion in Jerusalem. Will the Roman ensigns be planted within the walls of Jerusalem or not? Or if you prefer John the Baptist becoming Ponce Pilate. You can be sure there would be a lot of new converts. And what about Salome becoming the High Priest of the Temple? That's the trick used by Cronenberg. The film is a sad and pitiful if not pitiless pathetic vignette on the Russia mafia in Europe, since Europe has opened its boarders to the East and yet the ending is a twist in the fabric, a pirouette between two pas de deux and nothing has changed except that a king is dead and another kind is alive? Long live the new King. Louis XVI has become Robespierre. Charles I is now Oliver Cromwell. What can come out of such a crazy upside down situation? A big mess till some politicians really have the courage to say that will do and to stamp down on these cockroaches, even if it costs a few lives on the security forces' side. So far no one dares say a word, or nearly no one, because these perambulating shadowy mafias are either the descendants of the poor victims of the KGB, or the descendants of the poor victims of Ceausescu, or the members of an ethnic group that has made it a living style and an income to remain in the margin of society and suck all they can from the those who have to get up in the morning, go to work, work and then come back in the evening. It is truly a great way of life to get up after noon, do nothing up to night fall and then spend the night playing the guitar, smoking, drinking, and now and then going on a foraging trip into some deserted areas. Scrap metal is going up very fast at the present moment. By the way if these have a heart attack in the middle of their nighttime pleasures they expect public hospitals to give them freely and free of charge the best treatment they have at their disposal, and they, the nighttime revelers, deserve obviously due to the astronomically high level of contributions they have paid all along. Have you read ""Thinner"" by Stephen King? I would advise you to complement this film with that short novel. That would give you the picture of those perambulating wild populations that are roaming around in Europe. The tobacconist and newsagent in my village did not believe it till one night she was burglarized. You should have heard her yelling when her insurance company refused to cover most of her loss because she had no alarm on her door and windows. God, how naïve some people are!

52,Floated2,Well acted but slowly paced,5,10 February 2017,"Eastern Promises has been praise as one of David Cronenberg's finest films, for several reasons. Although the film is well acted by it's leads, and the scenery is wonderful, the overall storyline and plot of the film tends to lag and is not as intriguing or entertaining as many make it out to be. Eastern Promise is quite short in running time which in this case there could have been more time to develop other plot points. The main criticism of this film is that the storyline is not intriguing and it is very predictable. And rather boring and bland at times. We understand what will occur throughout, and the suspense is very non- existent. No twists or key points which make the viewers wanted more. The acting is well thought out as Cronenberg is prime with Viggo Mortensen for another collaboration, and Naomi Watts delivers her role thoughtfully. Very few scenes of strong violence, and it is very far and in between. The violence occurs only quickly and is not as stable and throughout or unexpecting as it could have been.",Eastern Promises
53,johnnyboyz,"Steady, powerful crime drama with a number of star performances and a rich amount of substance, all combining on top of wondrous direction to provide one of Cronenberg's best.",8,23 August 2010,"Of course there are those who'll see Eastern Promises as a companion piece to A Histroy of Violence, a film that leads us down a route of pertaining the lead male to have one role or persona before pulling the rug from under us as well as the exploring of additional ideas revolving around the delving deeper into a world; a world which on the surface is quite charming and almost too good to be true, but is actually full of sordid secrets. All of this, as the director's own ability to combine content of both a bloody and brutal nature along with a more simplistic and down to Earth sense of ordinary, daily people just going about ordinary, daily lives feels present. David Cronenberg's 2007 gangster film effortlessly weaves its way down a number of passages, plots and character arcs; dragging us with it the entire way and culminating in a bloody bathhouse fight within which violence it is not at all ashamed to turn away from plays out. Here is a gangster film that has the stature to be placed up there amongst the best of the genre of the last decade.The film has an eye for a sense of hierarchy just as much as it has one for low level criminals merely existing on their chosen plateau, the resulting effort from a number of people of a wide birth of nations seeing chief components of predominant British and American gangster films effortlessly combined. Principally, Cronenberg gives us two lead characters; one for the first time we see the film and one for every other time we see it. First, there is Naomi Watts' Anna; a smart, attractive, quick thinking nurse based in London, whom lives with her mother and uncle following a miscarriage with a partner now gone. When young Russian prostitute Tatiana is brought to her following a giving-birth, her diary detailing all sorts of sordid exploits plus references to a local restaurant run by Russian gangster Semyon (Mueller-Stahl) is found. It's a good job Anna is who she is, Semyon's beautiful restaurant in its low lighting; luxurious looking furniture and precision attitude towards its catering masking what lurks beneath in a sex trafficking operation and an additionally bloody existence in which people such as his son gleefully indulge all too often. If a single, young male with very few friends and connections were to have shown up seeking out the truth; Semyon's resulting actions towards the bringer may have been somewhat different. The diary drives one half of the film, its role as a MacGuffin effectively used to stretch out as much tension and pot boiling as possible. In one scene the severity of its content is verbally highlighted by Anna to the audience, and Semyon, whom then goes to distract us by occupying where there should be a reply by tasting and commenting on some Borscht cooking on a stove. A prominent sense that he is avoiding something. Then there's Mortensen's Nikoli, best buddy of Semyon's son Kirill (Cassel, who's always simply marvellous); driver for Semyon's organisation and body depositor for the same man. When we're in the dark as much as Anna the first time, we side more with her rather than the sadistic and bloody minded Russians; but consequent viewings shift us more in favour of observing a struggle with guilt and the pushing away of human morals so as to attain a larger goal without ever being able to confide with the innocent's caught up in the middle. Being spat on and forced into sexual intercourse with a woman half one's age, just so as to prove one's masculinity, are two things that must be endured with little to no conferment possible.Indeed, the film is more focused in both tone and narrative than 2005's A History of Violence. An early sex sequence in that film seeing alias; role play and duality played out as a means of garnering sexual pleasure, most likely against Mortensen's character's wishes given the items that come with his character whom harboured links to such things. There his expression, as he lay on the bed forced into carrying out said actions involving a cheer-leading outfit, was always a fascinating mixture of pain and anguish at having to lie and be forced into playing along, with a general sense of allurement. Here, this scene involving a sexual encounter ties in with a similar occurrence involving him in Eastern Promises; something linked to his duality and of his reaction, indeed facial expression, after being forced to carry out sexual relations with a young Eastern European prostitute in a brothel Semyon owns. Again, similar notions of pain and anguish at having to lie and the being forced into playing along with engaging in sexual escapades, as he struggles with duality and the probable 'want' not to do what's being placed on top of him, is etched onto Mortensen's face and are wonderfully explored.In kicking things off with a brutal execution, made more agonising by the fact a younger, less experienced individual whom we feel does not belong to this 'world' carries it out and it is his first; Cronenberg plunges us into a cold; bleak; grey world, characteristics of the locale going on to echo the film's overall tone. A sense of hierarchy is applied to young killer Ekrem (Altin) as Nikolai, Kirill and friends watch on while he beams at having got ""tickets for Chelsea match!"", the 'higher' eastern mobsters observing before one of them retorting that perhaps he ought to ""go and watch a DVD, or something"" almost certainly instilling a child-like sensibility about him, a young and naive persona that dictates he is out of his depth. There is a distinct menace to the film's brooding, ominous atmosphere; grubby and filthy without necessarily being unpleasant. It is one of 2007's best and it is, most certainly, one of David Cronenberg's best.",Eastern Promises
54,filipemanuelneto,An excellent film about the mysterious Russian mafia.,8,24 July 2021,"I confess that I expected less from this movie. I really like movies set in the mob world, but the Russian mob was something I had rarely seen on film before. This film is very good at immersing us in that universe, and David Cronenberg was happy in the way he carried out this project, a little out of his usual record.The film follows a London nurse, Anna, on her quest to find out more about the young mother of a baby she saw born, who appears to have been a prostitute from the East. The essential clues will come from a diary, kept by the teenager, which will link her to a respectable and wealthy Russian family, residing in London, who are behind a powerful branch of the Russian mafia in the United Kingdom. The script, engaging and intelligent, seems credible and logical most of the time, and manages to engage the audience and instigate our curiosity. One thing I particularly have to praise is the recurrent use of Russian and Ukrainian in the film, a feature that may confuse the minds of Anglophone audiences, but which I found excellent, appropriate and intelligent, insofar as the actors did it well, without it ever sounding fake or forced. The highlight of the film is the action scenes, and particularly the fight in the Turkish baths, starring Mortensen. From there, the film continues and maintains our interest, but it fails to give us something as intense or exciting.For me, and if we exclude the films from the ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Hobbit"" trilogies, this is the biggest and best film in Viggo Mortensen's career so far. I also liked his work on ""Hidalgo"", but I think he surpassed it here. I don't know how far his character was supposed to have the charisma he gave him, but Mortensen was able to dominate the film with a magnetic, powerful and intriguing performance. Another actor who did an excellent job was veteran Armin Mueller Stahl, in the role of the family patriarch who is the center of this film. He seems affectionate and kind, refined and very courteous, but he hides a dark, brutal and cynical side. Initially, I found Vincent Cassel a bit one-dimensional with his character too brutal and violent, but I believe the actor knew how to work that out and effectively solve the problems that the character posed to him. Paradoxically, and despite being the main character par excellence, it's Naomi Watts who went out of her way in this film, with a character who seems to be limited to following the flow of information and who doesn't seem to have much else to do in the movie. Still a word for the good work of Sinéad Cusack and Jerzy Skolimowski, as Anna's parents.Technically, it's a film that has many points of interest, starting with a well-placed and regular pace, through elegant cinematography and a judicious choice of filming locations. Visually, it's a beautiful movie that is pleasing to the eye. The sound also works very well, and the visual, specials and sound effects, punctually placed, are of quality and work well. The costumes and sets are very good, but they are within an expected standard, and the soundtrack, written by Howard Shore, didn't sound as good as I could demand in a film with so many qualities.",Eastern Promises
55,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Cronenberg brings a unique feel to organized crime film,8,7 February 2008,"At first glance, the most refreshing thing about ""Eastern Promises"" is that it doesn't involve the mafia. It is about the Russian mob in England, not Italians in America. What results when director David Cronenberg (""A History of Violence"") tells this story is something familiar, but fresh and interesting.""Promises"" shows how the life of nurse/midwife Anna (Naomi Watts) collides with the Russian mob when she uncovers the indecent diary of a dead Russian patient. Viggo Mortensen is in the employ of this major crime family whose untamed and immature son Kiril (Vincent Cassel of ""Ocean's Twelve"" fame) is looking to take control of the operations.What makes the film stand out is the way the world with which we can identify (Watts' character's story) and the world of which we are afraid (Russian mob) interact with each other. There is nothing glitzy, no mob glorification. It is all very real, like it could happen next door and you'd never know it. Cronenberg shows a generally modern London that is not too overtly dark or corrupt, but dark enough to convey the feeling that something goes on there behind the scenes where you don't expect.Mortensen, Cassel and Watts excel in their roles, though the two definitely not Russian actors could have been stronger in their accents and believability. Still, personality wise Mortensen is the standout. His tall, silent, dark hero persona makes him very enjoyable to watch.""Promises"" is a film about coming to terms with the sometimes all too dark truth of people and sometimes ourselves in particular and through it all trying to find the hope that keeps us going. It might be told in a chilling way, but the whole idea is to feel uncomfortable with it. It may not rivet you, but it will leave an impression.",Eastern Promises
56,funkyfry,Strange and violent drama,5,19 January 2009,"This film is poised somewhere neatly between being great and unique and being rather pedestrian and forgettable. On the negative side of the balance, there's a plot structure that one hopes would be more complex, but which ends up being as contrived as an early 20th Century film melodrama -- the orphaned baby in the hospital, threatened by ethnic gangsters... the all-too-obvious secret agent who blows his own cover but gets away with it... etc. On the other hand, Viggo Mortensen gives a decent performance, affected accent aside, and Vincent Cassel is brilliant. There are some pretty cool violent action scenes, which might be a positive or a negative for different people -- the director Cronenberg has often been accused of needless gore, while his defenders often argue that gore is a style and a manner of formalism for him. Eastern Promises always seems to hang just on the precipice of bad taste and even sheer stupidity, and the artistic accomplishment to which these ends are used is questionable in the end.An orphaned baby's mother leaves behind a diary with all kinds of mafia secrets which is discovered and for some reason allowed to remain in the possession of the nurse on duty at the time (Naomi Watts) instead of the police. Leaving aside the fact that the diary plot device is more stale than Shakespeare allusions, the movie then throws in this chauffeur character (Mortensen), and the audience can tell within 5 minutes that he knows way more than Cassel's character and is probably a secret agent. However, this possibility never occurs even to the hardened mafia types after the chauffeur arranges for a whore he slept with to be arrested and sent back to her home. One is left by the end of the movie, after witnessing this mafia's inept attempts to protect itself from a very obvious threat, to wonder how they could possibly have stayed in power for more than a few weeks.Cassel is the main saving grace of the film -- as a self-tortured repressed homosexual who's always dangerously close to releasing his energy in the form of violence on relatively innocent people, his volatile energy keeps the film going. The performances in general are very good, as Cronenberg knows how to work with the actor to bring out something interesting regardless of the material. But it's a shame to see the director and the cast trying to put meat on such a poor animal's bones. I greatly preferred the previous Mortensen/Cronenberg collaboration, ""A History of Violence."" There were some moments of this film that seemed to reach for territory even beyond that film's deliberately limited pallet, but the structure of the story wasn't strong enough for me to support or sustain those moments.I see ""Eastern Promises"" as an interesting failure. Ultimately the characters are more interesting than anything in the story, which is not inherently bad but is rather demanding towards the actors. Most carried through in this film, but it lacked a certain focus and vitality that the best films should have.",Eastern Promises
57,jzappa,I Always Love To See A Director With Such A Distinctive and Affecting Style Contribute To the Gangster Genre,9,20 October 2007,"Cronenberg's Eastern Promises is the best film he has ever made. It has the mysterious emotional essence that his films always somehow gracefully have, and it also has the ambient warmth of the most sophisticated foreign mystery, set amongst the dark, purely evil, scorpion-like Russian gangster culture and in its seclusive, unsuspecting district of the beautiful cobblestone streets of London. I believe the gangster film will live forever, because even when it tapers off, there will be a later group of filmmakers that will want to pay homage to a bygone era, hence we will always have the glorious, fascinating entertainment of movies about Mafia, and I always love to see a director with such a distinctive and affecting style contribute to the genre. Cronenberg has visual style that adds not only shots, backgrounds, sets, and ambiance that have an enigmatic intimacy but also maintains the indescribable cool that almost necessarily inhabits the stylistic 20/20 vision of a gangster film. He also has the ability create an intimacy on screen by manipulating the sound and scenery in the subtlest possible way, making the story almost exist in reality for us.This beautiful cinematic technique, which of course as a Cronenberg film includes Howard Shore's deeply haunting, infectious, and subtly powerful and magnetic musical score, is the discernible articulation of Steven Knight's dark, deep, emotionally complex, heart-rending script. It gracefully flows with elements that not only gangster stories but the most truly effective stories tend to have, like atmosphere, subtle manipulations and schemes, a deep and innate reservoir for compassion, sensuality, violence, and characters with entire worlds of layers, logic and emotion to them.I've never been as big of a fan of Viggo Mortensen as Cronenberg apparently is, but I think that Mortensen's performance as the cryptic Nikolai is magnificently done. His handling of Nikolai's physical appearance is stunning. It embodies all of the mystery, all of the self- control, all of the feelings and intentions he keeps masked. He is outstanding in this virtually perfect film.Watts adds a pocket of serenity and relief as a London hospital midwife, on her own personal quest for emotive alleviation and justice in a buried Russian secret that she cannot help but become invested in. Cassel's role adds the polar opposite to the movie as a combustible gangster, what seems to be his passion for all things vicious and bad portrayed with Cassel's signature ability to be shockingly vicious. Armin Mueller-Stahl is brilliantly ambiguous and incredibly real, and I imagine an Oscar nomination.",Eastern Promises
58,videorama-759-859391,Cronenberg film doesn't keep all it's promises,6,5 May 2014,"Cronenberg's follow up to A History of Violence, that has him treading new waters off the horror'ish genre into the crime thriller one. This has a intriguing kind of story, that I feel with the script, wasn't handled properly, where I found there was definitely room for improvement where I thought there might of more intrigue, suspense, or turns. Eastern Promises does have some ugly themes, involving teen prostitution and child rape, as painfully heard through a young girl's V.O as scrawled in a diary. She died during child birth (a frank shocking scene) as consequence of a rape, involving the Russian mafia, where this young lass was part of their stable. The diary ends up in the hands of a midwife, cute Naomi Watts, donning an English accent, only it's in Russian. Becoming personally involved, while digging a hole for herself, she gets the head of a Russian mafia (Mueller Stuhl) family to translate the diary, despite the loathing and disapproval of her Auntie, and Uncle, a firey one. Morttensen, totally incorporates a character who's so dangerously enigmatic, in a 360 degree change from other ones as a shady limo driver, in with the mafia, who spends time with Stuhl's son (Cassell) boozing and whoring, sometimes with a much particular younger kind of girl. His brilliant will stay in your memory, for a long time to come. Cassell though, has to be commended too, for bringing to the screen, such a repulsive and slimy SOB character of loathing, who you can't hate enough. The twist to Mortennsen's character I must say, I never saw coming, which in one sense, I was much gladdened. The violent moments are heavy, a few throat slashings among them, the one in it's start, brazenly shockingly, as we really go for the gulliver. In one way, it kind of stylizes this very entertaining film. But really like I said EP suffers from a mistreatment of script, with a few flat patches, and unhurried, if stalled pace of story.",Eastern Promises

62,freemantle_uk,Russian Gangsters in London,7,8 August 2008,"Eastern Promises is a film about the Russian Mafia in London. This is David Cronenberg second major thriller after the excellent A History of Violence. This is also the second major film Cronenberg worked with Viggo Mortensen, who is making a good effort to avoid being type-casted after Lord of the Rings.The film starts with a brutal murder of a Russian gangster before seeing a 14-year-old pregnant Russian teenager who falls unconscious and rushed to hospital. She gave birth to a girl, but the mother died during childbirth. The midwife Anne (Naomi Watts) takes a interest in this case and pities the mum and daughter. She takes the girl's diary, but it's in Russian. Anne finds a card to a Russian Restruant within the diary and goes to the place. This is where she meets the leader of a group of the Russian Mafia, and as the diary is translated Anne finds out the truth: that the girl was taken out of Russia to London under fault promises of becoming a sister and ends up being forced into prostitution. Within the Russian mob is Nikolai (Mortensen), the family driver and 'cleaner' who is sympathetic to Anne's cause. He has to deal with some violence characters and ends up doing violence actions himself, but does have at least some morals himself. He does not agree with the use of prostitution. In the middle of this a small turf war is brewing between factions of the Russian Mafia and Scottish Yard is investigating the murder of one gangster.This film is pretty good, but I was a little disappointed. It was not as good as A History of Violence and I felt that the final act was a little be unbelievable. I think it could have shown more about how the Russian Mafia works or more about the sex trade. But this film very well made, very well acted. Both Mortensen and Watts are very good actors and Cronenburg is a expert director. The main problem was with the scipit. The film is very violence, as expected, very bleak and if you are offended by male nudity then it best that you avoid this film. But during the male nudity is a very good fight scene. The film is as very short, just under an hour and half. Whether its a good thing or bad thing is best left up to you.",Eastern Promises
63,Polaris_DiB,Thematic duology?,10,24 September 2007,"This movie was entirely under-marketed--I didn't even hear about it until it appeared in the local listings, and even then it was pretty much described as ""like A History of Violence, another sober contemplation of violence from Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen,"" which, while true, doesn't really lend enough credit to either people for the work they put into this unique movie. I don't know why there seems to be a dearth of information about this film out there (though it might just be a fluke and I've been missing out), but it's surprising considering that Cronenberg, Mortensen, and Naomi Watts are all big names, and also because this movie is REALLY GOOD! The plot involves a midwife named Anna (Watts) who gets involved in the Russian mafia in London after a pregnant 14-year-old shows up at her hospital and dies in birth. Anna is too innocent and trusting to notice at first the type of people she's involving herself with, especially since she shares Russian ethnicity with them and they're more interested in playing up that fact. But slowly things begin to unravel as she pieces together translations of the dead girl's diary and the awkward way in which all of the men treat her, and also as she slowly gets involved with Nikolai (Mortensen), a stoic and reserved driver who nevertheless shows some genuine care for people's well-being.It's there that this movie is so masterfully directed and acted. Mortensen's character has little to no dialog or action to show his true nature, and yet all of the characters trust him, and most importantly, so does the audience. It's not just because Mortensen is the lead... he truly gives off the aura of someone who cares and protects, but who is trustworthy and disciplined as well (something that helps in the criminal world). Foiled against Kirill (Vincent Cassel), Mortensen is the hope of every character in the movie against the random and disturbing violent subtext of all of their lives.Secondly, Cronenberg is a master of gore and violence in that he knows how to use it, not abuse it--it is neither gratuitous or unnecessary, it truly horrifies no matter how little or how much he places into his movies. Furthermore, ""Eastern Promises"" could not have come out at a better time. Now that people are slowly getting over the rush from ""300"", it's good to see an actual scene of male aggression and male nudity presented in a way that isn't some equivalent to a glossy fashion magazine. The Turkish bath scene in this movie is a truly sensual organic moment, one where the viewer can feel the strain of bone, muscle, sinew, and adrenaline. It's not pretty in a Greek statue sense, but it's a stunning depiction nonetheless, and I regard it as a master of form showing up that type of drivel, even though it's much more likely that Cronenberg was just doing his own thing and not caring about the other movie.The best part about this movie is a lot of it's subtleties. In other hands, this movie could easily have become a generic gangster movie, but in Cronenberg's hands, it's completely unique. It also doesn't play into audience expectations, resulting in an ending that is reminiscent of the end of The Godfather without being a direct, snazzy reference to it. I honestly haven't seen Cronenberg make a movie this good since Videodrome, and I also am pretty sure that Eastern Promises will prove to be one of the best films to be released this year.--PolarisDiB",Eastern Promises
64,dfranzen70,Promise well kept,8,20 January 2008,"Any time a new movie is shot in black and white, people use adjectives like ""stark"" and ""realistic"" to describe it. Sometimes they'll combine the two: ""stark realism"" and so forth. The style is supposed to be evocative of grittier, dirtier times (can anyone imagine a colorized Grapes of Wrath?), times when people kept on keepin' on as best they could while dealing with the harsh realities of daily life.The black and white cinematography in David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises compares and contrasts the everyday lives of middle-class Londoners with the raw, terror-fueled violence of expatriate Russian gangsters. Additionally, as in other, earlier movies, the truly bloody moments are made all the scarier because of the lack of color; everything feels realer while still seeming authentic. (Not an easy feat; for ultrarealism that seems insincere, try reality television.) A midwife named Anna (Naomi Watts) helps deliver a baby to an unidentified young girl who dies during childbirth; Anna, being a Good Samaritan, decides to try to discover the girl's family, so that the newborn can live with them instead of slipping away into the red-tape-ridden foster-care system. Aided by a diary found in the girl's handbag, Anna winds up at a Russian restaurant owned by Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), who promises to help Anna in her quest by translating the diary from Russian to English.Meanwhile, a lower-level employee of Semyon named Nikolai (a sensational Viggo Mortensen) is slowly moving his way up the ladder of Semyon's empire, which is of course not wholly invested in restauranting. Nikolai is one of those marvelously inscrutable figures who knows far more than what he says, which is precious little, in contrast - there's that word again - with Semyon's own son, Kirill (an equally wonderful Vincent Cassel), who is boisterous, petulant, and covetous. The film manages to make its audience question Nikolai's intentions and loyalties; is he merely in this murderous racket for his own gain? Steven Knight's screenplay is tight, coarse, and even a bit gruesome; it's definitely not for the weak of stomach or heart. (A dead man's fingers are removed in a very early scene, for one thing, and there's an extended fight scene involving a nude Mortensen in a steam bath.) As with any other suspense thriller worth its salt, there are plenty of plausible twists and turns - but none can be easily foreseen, and they aren't simply strung together as red herrings designed to just continually shock the audience, which is the sort of thing a younger Cronenberg might have attempted.All four leads are terrific; Watts is an improvement over Maria Bello, who costarred with Mortensen in Cronenberg's A History of Violence (maybe he's got something for cute young blonde actresses). But this isn't one of those innocent-young-heroine-saves the day movies, either. You know the ones. The girl with seemingly no talents, smarts, or powers somehow defeats a tough, organized opponent using only her womanly wiles and spunkiness. No, not here. Anna is intelligent and resourceful, yes, but the real conflict isn't between her and the evil Russian mafia, it's a conflict within the crime family itself. The dichotomy between Nikolai, the outsider becoming the boss's favorite, and Kirill, the son at war with his own inner demons, is richly detailed with a modicum of dialog (mostly Kirill's). Cassel and Mortensen are so wonderful together, you almost think that their characters ARE brothers instead of one being naturally superior (by birthright) to the other.Cronenberg's come a long way since making slasher pics in Canada (this is, in fact, the first of his movies that was filmed entirely outside of Canada); it's as if he woke up a few years ago and decided he wasn't going to make any gross-out pics like The Fly, Rabid, Scanners, or Dead Ringers. Coupled with A History of Violence, Eastern Promises is raw, energetic, and stunningly filmed.",Eastern Promises

Here in the Eastern European émigré community,the remit of the Russian Mafia holds sway. Benign restaurateur (Mr A.Mueller - Stahl)an outwardly charming and sophisticated man is in reality a ruthless gang boss heavily engaged in what used to be called the ""White Slave""trade.His son Kiril (Mr V.Cassel) is an out - of - control sadist with barely repressed sexual feelings towards his father's driver (Mr V.Mortensen). When a 14 year - old prostitute dies in childbirth a midwife finds a diary written in Russian that alleges she was raped by Mueller - Stahl and the baby was his. The midwife,who lost a child of her own not long before,becomes obsessed with finding the orphaned baby's family . Mr D.Cronenberg does wonders with this sow's ear of a plot. ""Eastern Promises"" certainly has some of his signature scenes of appalling violence which will please his admirers,but it is the casting that lifts it out of the usual run of Russian Mafia movies. Mr Mueller - Stahl is superbly believable as the multi - faceted restaurant owner.Capable of both extreme charm and extreme violence,he orders his own son to find and kill the baby that is in fact his half -sister and can link his father to the rape,. M.Cassel as the son never quite goes over the edge no matter how tempted he might have felt. Mr Mortensen (""I'm just the driver"") is the object of Kiril's guilty lust.Being gay is not an option for Russian gangsters apparently. Miss N.Watts is tough,bruised and determined,a flawed heroine for the 21st century. There are a few loose ends that presumably the director was happy for his audience to fret over,but it is a grown - up film for people who know life rarely dots all the i's and crosses the tees.",Eastern Promises
66,kevin_robbins,This is an underrated Cronenberg gem that is a masterpiece,10,14 September 2021,"Eastern Promises (2007) is a movie my wife and I recently watched out of my personal DVD collection. The storyline follows a Ukrainian sex slave who dies during childbirth and leaves a journal telling her life story. The journal quickly puts the mob at risk and they will stop at nothing to recover it. A naive woman stumbles onto the journal quickly putting her life at risk. This movie is directed by David Cronenberg (A History of Violence) and stars Naomi Watts (Mulholland Drive), Viggo Mortensen (Lord of the Rings), Vincent Cassel (Black Swan) and Josef Altin (Game of Thrones). The storyline for this picture is super unique in terms of settings, characters, storylines and sub plots. There is so much to like here. The cast delivers magnificent performances and the action scenes are subtle and well executed. The opening barbershop and and pharmacy scenes are brutal and the ending shower fight scene is legendary. Overall this is an underrated Cronenberg gem that is a masterpiece and easy 10/10 for me.",Eastern Promises
67,PWNYCNY,WARNING: Any resemblance between the Russians portrayed in this movie and actual Russians is purely coincidental,3,21 September 2007,"First, before you watch this movie please be advised that any resemblance between any Russians portrayed in this movie and any actual Russians. living or deceased, is purely coincidental. Now that Russians are portrayed as being a bunch of degenerate, child-abusing, vodka swigging, mindless cutthroats (literally), let's leave fantasy-land and go to the facts. The same people who this movie portrays as being lower than the lowest Nazi thugs thwarted and repelled the insane attempt of 3 million Nazis to destroy the Soviet Union. By December 1941 the Russians had stopped the Nazis in their track and by 1944 had evicted the invaders and then literally chased them back to Berlin which the Russians without any outside help then proceeded to systematically conquer and pacify - and did this against fanatical Nazi opposition. Indeed, the Battle of Berlin is now legendary. There's more! The Russians were the first to launch a satellite into orbit; the first to launch an animal into space; the first to launch a man into orbit; the first to launch a woman into space; the first to accomplish a space walk; the first to launch a space station; the first to place an object on the moon; and the first to place an object on the surface of another planet. During the Depression of the 1930s the U.S. unemployment rate was estimated at being 25 percent while in the Soviet Union, where Russians were the majority of the population, unemployment was zero. Indeed, while the West was sinking deeper and deeper into economic quicksand the Soviet Union was experiencing a period of massive industrialization and economic expansion. Even today Russia commands respect and is a country to be reckoned with. The point of this historical retrospective is to provide a more balanced picture of the Russian people who have produced some of the greatest novelists, composers and artists in history. Okay, now back to the movie. This movie can be best described in one word, bizarre. The violence is graphic and the characters, including the ones who are supposed to be nice, are nasty, except for the baby who is very cute and always smiling. This movie seems to be a take-off on The Godfather, but without the polish and finesse that marked that excellent movie. The music was oppressive and the ending was anti-climatic. Vigo Mortensen gives a powerful performance which is not matched by the other actors. If you like movies that have gratuitous violence, such as an incredible fight scene in a sauna, unlikeable characters, graphic portrayals of degenerate acts, including statutory rape, and ponderous scripts then this movie is for you. What makes this movie even more ludicrous is that the story takes place not in Moscow or some other Russian venue, but in London, England. So after watching this movie, all you British people be on the lookout for vodka-guzzling, gun-totting Russian-speaking cut-throats because one of them may be your neighbor. And for goodness sake, next time you take car service please make sure that the driver isn't carrying a dagger because that driver may actually be hit-man for the Russian mafia.

68,dee.reid,"""Eastern Promises"" - Crossing the border into the mainstream",10,24 September 2007,"""Eastern Promises"" is perhaps the most mainstream film ever directed by the Canadian-born David Cronenberg. ""Eastern Promises"" comes two years after Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence,"" the film largely responsible for propelling the director into international fame - even though he's been on the scene now for over 30 years and for those who know his movies, like me, ""A History of Violence"" and ""Eastern Promises"" represent his next logical steps in his already-distinguished career as a filmmaker.It helps if you know a little something about Cronenberg. He became famous during the late 1970s and 1980s for his ""body horror"" movies, known for their extreme gore factor, graphic sexual content, and thoroughly perverse subtext on the beauty of bodily destruction. If you've ever seen ""Scanners"" (1981), ""Videodrome"" (1983), his only Oscar-winner ""The Fly"" (1986), ""Dead Ringers"" (1988), ""Crash"" (1996) and ""eXistenZ"" (1999), you can say you know something about Cronenberg's film-making methods.""Eastern Promises,"" the director's latest, is by no means a horror movie and is in fact a thoroughly pronounced gangster picture centering on the Russian underworld and their gruesome operations in London, even though, otherwise, Cronenberg's style hasn't changed. There's still plenty of extreme violence and gore (including several bloody throat-cuttings that were reportedly inspired by terrorist beheading videos and a nude bathhouse brawl) and graphic nudity and musings on bodily destruction, just as his fans have come to revel with each new film he puts out.The film largely centers on Anna (Naomi Watts), a British-Russian midwife who finds herself caring for a newborn baby girl after its young mother dies following childbirth. Left with no clues as to the young girl's identity, except a diary, Anna sets off on a trek to find the young girl's family. This sets off a chain of events that will bring her into contact with the brutal and mysterious Russian mob hit-man Nikolai (Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"" alumni Viggo Mortensen), and his employers Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) and Semyon's reckless and dangerous son Kirill (Vincent Cassel).It goes without saying that ""Eastern Promises"" is nothing like Cronenberg's earlier films, and that's a good thing. Though Cronenberg matured a long time ago, ""Eastern Promises"" shows the director in a light that's accepting to mainstream audiences while still giving his entrenched fan-base something new to know and love. I bet that when he came on the scene back in the 1970s, he probably didn't know he'd be making a movie about the Russian mafia and receiving high praises for it.In terms of acting and writing, the screenplay by Steven Knight sorts through layers and layers of brutality to understand the motivations of human beings caught in a desperate situation. Knight's script also takes a rather unflinching look at the inner-workings of the Russian underworld, and it is captivating and frightening, like watching one of Cronenberg's old horror movies, only... not, even though his camera never misses a shot of mobsters getting their throats slashed (talk about bending and blending genres). That's perhaps why in crossing over from ""B""-movie horror into the mainstream, Cronenberg is so successful as a director.Mortensen, sporting his best Russian accent while wearing his black & white business suit and black sunglasses and somewhat resembling the Ed Harris character in ""A History of Violence,"" is densely engaging and we can easily see some of the conflict he might be experiencing by doing his job. It's also my understanding that to prepare for his role, he underwent extensive body makeup and actually traveled to Russia and interacted with shady mob types. Watts is good too, as the young midwife desperately trying to deliver a young child from a world of increasing violence.""Eastern Promises,"" in more ways than one, may actually be David Cronenberg's most accomplished film as a director. He possesses the skill, the talent, and the ability to really cross different borders and do a terrific job at it.10/10",Eastern Promises

70,MBunge,Who better than Viggo?,7,13 June 2012,"Beautifully directed and chillingly performed, the only thing keeping Eastern Promises out of the pantheon of legendary gangster flicks is that its script sometimes feels like it began life as a TV movie of the week. However, even that can't detract from Viggo Mortensen again proving to be one of the most skillful actors of his age and director David Cronenberg giving us one of the greatest fight scenes in cinema history. Throw in Vincent Cassel almost matching Viggo move for move and Armin Mueller-Stahl completing a triumvirate of seething menace and you've got a Cronenberg movie at which even non-Cronenberg fans should really take a gander.When a pregnant girl dies on the table, leaving only her newborn baby and her diary behind, a London midwife (Naomi Watts) finds herself caught in the vortex of a Russian mob family. Patriarch Semyon (Armin Mueler-Stahl) has an easy charm that fails to conceal his utterly ruthless nature. His son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) is wild and immature, both completely committed to and deeply jealous of Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), the family's coolly stoic driver who is one of those guys that the first time you see him, you know you never want to mess with him. Nikolai is Kirill's right hand man but is a hanger on as far as the family business goes, until the problem of the dead girl's diary and what it says about Semyon and Kirill gives Nikolai the chance to become the Russian version of a ""made man"".The plot of Eastern Promises is basically a tour through Russian mob culture and the human trafficking that happens in the underworld of London and so many other major cities around the world. It's more educational than dramatic and that, along with a far too melodramatic conclusion, are the only things you can count against this production.On the plus side, Viggo is dynamic in a role where he has to dominate the screen with little dialog and sometimes barely changing expression. You hear about actors doing insane levels of research and preparation for a part and Viggo shows here why that's sometimes necessary and how beneficial it can be. He conveys centuries of Russian criminal culture with every move and tilt of his head. Cassel gets the flashier job as Kirill but he nearly equals Viggo in deftly presenting a man who often can't admit to himself the reasons why he acts the way he does. Mueller-Stahl isn't far behind his younger co-stars in slowing stripping away the cultured veneer of Semyon until he's reduced to almost primal evil.It may seem like I'm slightly the lovely Naomi Watts in not mentioning her. Anna, though, is mainly a plot device and while ably inhabited by Watts, she's little more than a night light in the darkness of Eastern Promises.Cronenberg is Cronenberg and while his patented off-kilter take is subdued here by the direct focus of the material, he does blow the doors off with a scene where a stark naked Nikolai has to fight for his life against two revenge-seeking Chechen gangsters. At the risk of raising your expectations too high, it's one of the most arresting sequences you'll ever watch.Eastern Promises is a very good movie with a couple of outstanding features that make this almost a must-see. It you haven't, it's worth making the effort to track it down.",Eastern Promises
71,Chris_Docker,fulfils its promise,7,12 March 2008,"It might seem strange that a film so brimming over with realism and weighty moral issues should leave me puzzling over the title. I suspect that the good director might even have missed the point . . . But maybe many say that about Cronenberg. Videodrome, Crash, eXistenZ. Easier to appreciate in retrospect. Then he shoots accessible stuff  History of Violence was almost mainstream; and combined critical success with audience figures. Eastern Promises is a straightforward, well-made mobster movie. But I was left feeling it both exceeded and failed to reach expectations.It begins with a rapid shapeshifting and manipulation of audience emotion worthy of Almodovar. We are shocked at the violence, thrown into grief over the terrible story of a young mother who dies on the operating table, and catapulted into warm fuzzies over the silver-lining birth of her child. Cronenberg has learnt that crafting such a heady opening cocktail of feelings leaves us like soft putty in his hands. And fortunately the story never flags from thereon.Naomi Watts plays a lovely young nurse. She helps the birth of the child, sees the death of the mother, and promptly steals her diary. Viggo Mortensen is a menacing-looking gofer of the Russian mob. They want the diary contents to remain secret. Naomi's uncle, like the dead mother, is Russian. Which provides a foreboding for nasty goings-on, all executed with exceeding flair.Here's another good thing about it: The Godfather spawned many inferior Italian-mafia copies  but where is the definitive Russian mafia movie? Mostly they boast cardboard stooges for Western film-stars to trounce (eg Snatch). The research done by Mortensen and Cronenberg pays off handsomely: these are the most convincing mobsters I hope you never meet. A fight scene (featuring Mortensen naked in a men's' bathhouse) is one of the best fight scenes even made. The background on the workings of the mob, especially a code of tattoos and a system of qualifications, is unsettlingly authentic. Many of the actors are Eastern European, and even Mortensen acts very convincingly in Russian.The moral dilemmas are supposed to be about honour between thieves. Naomi Watts is torn by her hatred of a man in whom she feels a suspicion of decency or attraction. Although she performs it well, her portrayal of a similar predicament is played more strongly in her 'acting audition' scene in Mulholland Drive. But what a consummate actress! Did Cronenberg simply not stretch her enough? Or did he want to keep Eastern Promises as a plot-driven movie? A touch more melodrama could have given it a broader audience and also room to explore more heart-rending themes than cheating the boss. For we are told early on that the dead mother, in her posthumous, 'diary' voice-over, was sold as a sex-slave from Eastern Europe.The pitfall that most filmmakers and others fall prey to in that debate is getting caught up in the heated 'ban-prostitution vs legislate-and-regulate' debate. The uncontroversial work is preventing sex-slavery at source, where girls are sold by friends and boyfriends under the pretence of a fine job waiting in the West. Even UN Goodwill Ambassador Angelina Jolie makes the mistake of demonising men's desire in her film Inhuman Traffic (You can see the film at mtvexit.org. Though the first half of it is truly superlative in showing the traps, and the work to save people from them.) Men are not saints or sinners according to their sexual desires and neither are women  who are socially stigmatised for sexual freedom. It is the manipulation of one person by another (in slavery) that is the wrong. Other policies should be tailored to stop it. Perhaps prostitution could even be made redundant: if women, generally, could express themselves sexually as freely as men do, and without shame. The strength of Eastern Promises is that it portrays the horror of the woman forced into prostitution but leaves the moral questions to the audience. I hope very much it will be seen by many in Eastern Europe. Thrillers can sometimes reach the masses better than a goodwill film (The Inhuman Traffic website has an array of languages, but even its 'Russian' download fails to subtitle the English dialogue.)Ideological conflict over prostitution and trafficking is so contentious that networking and coalition among anti-trafficking initiatives is often hampered. A small film like this could promise more than entertainment in countries at risk. It could warn people of empty promises that can ruin their life.",Eastern Promises
72,MaxBorg89,Cronenberg keeps his promise: another masterpiece,10,15 January 2008,"Brief, sudden and very, very explicit. The violence in David Cronenberg's filmography, that is. With few exceptions (e.g. Spider), the Canadian auteur doesn't make one movie without at least one moment of realistic carnage, and he follows his best picture, A History of Violence, with another personal and unique take on the gangster genre.That this won't be a merry tale is clear from the opening sequence: whereas most of the director's works keep the blood stored for a while, Promises begins with a man getting his throat slashed in a barbershop and a pregnant teenager going into premature labor while asking a pharmacist for help. It is the latter incident that kick-starts the movie, the girl being rushed to a hospital and dying in childbirth. Anna (Naomi Watts), a Londoner of Russian descent, takes an interest in her fate and is led to a restaurant run by another Russian, the seemingly kind and helpful Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl). In reality, his business is only a cover-up for illicit activities, carried out mostly by his son Kirill (Vincent Cassel), a brute with a serious booze problem, and Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), a cold, enigmatic figure who has many secrets, masked by a simple ""I'm just the driver"". It is clear that Nikolai is a more suitable successor than Kirill, and it is him that Anna keeps meeting as she seeks answers, most of which are bathed in blood.Working completely outside Canada for the first time, Cronenberg has chosen London to analyze Russian low-life. But it isn't the London we're used to: no fancy shops, no friendly Brits, just Eastern fellas, old-fashioned buildings and lots of horrifying events. A similar situation was described in Stephen Frears' Dirty Pretty Things, written by Promises' Steven Knight, but the Crash director favors a Greek tragedy-inspired approach, similar to The Godfather, over the gritty realism chosen by Frears. The city is depicted at its bleakest, prompting Semyon (so scarily calm he would intimidate the whole Corleone clan) to call it a ""city of whores and queers."".Apart from the sombre atmosphere, though, there is very little in this film that can be labeled as ""mainstream"", with Cronenberg using the Vory V Zakone organization to provide a new look on his primary obsessions: identity and body. In this case, the two aspects merge in a disturbingly entrancing scene where Nikolai (Mortensen's best role to date) has his torso decorated with tattoos, all of which constitute some kind of graphic biography. Paired with an unexpected revelation in the third act, this gives Eastern Promises layers of depth and meaning that would be lacking in a conventional gangster flick.The real surprise, however, is the director's ability to reinvent himself: just when it was safe to assume he couldn't push the gore envelope any further, Croneneberg hits the viewer real hard with the best scene of his career - a quick, relentlessly brutal fight set in a bathhouse, featuring Mortensen completely naked and unarmed against two knife-carrying thugs. ""Body"" horror doesn't get more physical than this. Astonishing.",Eastern Promises

While trying to find out about the mother and where the baby should live, a midwife, Anna, locates the mother's diary. Within it contains links to someone within the Russian Mafia. How far will Anna dare to shine a light into that world to uncover the cruel truth about the dead mother's predicament? This was a quality film yet not overly memorably aside from a brutal and graphic knife fight scene.

74,kluseba,"No, twists, no tension, no atmosphere - a quite ordinary movie!",4,27 May 2010,"I watched this film because of the well known actors and the interesting story involving a Russian background which interests me a lot.But except of a shocking opening scene, a nice fight scene in the sauna and as always a charming Naomi Watts (though she acts way better in most of her other movies), there is nothing special that was still on my mind after watching this film.To be honest, the film is quite a deception. The story is boring and not touching at all, there are no surprising twists in the movie, everything is quite predictable, the actors are left way beyond their professional possibilities, there is nothing special about the way the movie was directed, nothing touching about the atmosphere (a film has not a Russian flow because some of the actors are speaking Russian or have strange and exaggerated stereotypical accents!). The film is quite ordinary and has no philosophy. There is no clear object of the movie, it wants to be a thriller (though you know who has murdered whom), a movie about Russian mafia (showing many clichés but nothing new) mixed with some emotional elements (which stay superficial and not really convincing).All in all, I can really not recommend this movie to anyone, this one is okay to watch it one time, but it already has some lengths and a second viewing (or the purchase of this one as a DVD or Bluray) would be a complete waste of time and money.If you would like to watch a movie about Russian cultural and the country's dark side go for ""Archangel"", ""Transsiberian"" or the more historical ""Defiance"".

Since she doesn't understand Russian, she gives the diary to her racist uncle Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski) to translate for her. If he could find her name, any family or friends, she wrote on her diary. Anna finds an business card on her diary, it brings her to a Trans-Siberian restaurant owned by Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl). Anna thinks that that the recently deceased girl might have worked in the restaurant or knew someone there. Semyon becomes curious about Anna's situation and Anna mention to Semyon that she kept an diary. When Semyon wants to translate the diary himself, he's shocked by it and it mentions in the diary his son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) a few times. Now Semyon wants that diary but Anna wants any information of the baby's family whereabout before she gives the diary to Semyon. Which Anna doesn't want to give up the baby for adaption. Stepon knows that Anna wasn't well informed as Semyon told her. There's more dark aspect to the dead's Russian girl diary that Semyon isn't telling Anna.

Which Nikolai is a low-life, who works for Semyon and his son... who are in part of the Russian mob. But Nikolai has an hidden agenda of his own. No one is what they seemed to be in the seedy underworld of London, England ""United Kingdom"".Directed by David Cronenberg (Crash, Dead Ringers, Naked Lunch) made an fascinating character drama with full of rich details and strong characterization by the cast. Cronenberg reunites with his co-star Mortensen from the terrific ""A History of Violence"". Which Mortensen plays the exact opposite of that character in the previous movie, he worked with director Cronenberg. Probably the best performance in the film is by Armin Mueller-Sthal, which his strong supporting role is quite chilling as the main villain in the movie. Watts, Cassel, Skolimowski and Sinead Cusack as Anna's mother deliver fine performances as well.Like most of Cronenberg's film, he's reunited with his top crew members. Like Three Time Oscar-Winner:Howard Shore (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Silence of the Lambs, Se7en), Cinematographer:Peter Suschitzky (The Empire Strikes Back, Krull, The Rocky Horror Picture Show), Editor:Ronald Sanders (Firestater, The Fly ""1986"", Scanners), Production Designer:Carol Spier (The League of Extraordinary Gentleman, Mimic, Silent Hill) and others. Like most of Cronenberg's movies, this is one is nearly perfect as well. This one has an conclusion that is both happy and sad. This has one of the most violent (realistic) fight in a key scene. Like films about the mafia, this is certainly much different and Cronenberg does have an eye for originality. Some viewers might be turn-off by the disturbing premise in the film or some of the key character's revelations in the third act. I wouldn't be surprised if this film will receive for some Oscar nominations for 2008. This is a picture, not to be missed.

Once again, he composes an exposition on the subject matter of violence, and likewise, he extracts an electrifying performance from his star Viggo Mortensen by delving deeper in that vein.This time around, Cronenberg brings us into the world of the Russian crime organizations in London. We are taken there by Anna (Naomi Watts), a midwife, as she looks for relatives of a 14 year old girl who dies in childbirth under her care. The girl leaves a diary written in Russian which leads Anna right into the web.Through Anna, we meet the major players in that Russian underground: a deceptive restaurant owner-crime boss Semyon (Armin Mueller Stahl), his psychologically-disturbed son (Vincent Cassel) and their stoic driver Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen). With this story as background, the movie proceeds to delve right into the underbelly of the subculture where these protagonists live their depraved lives.The acting is of very high caliber. Armin Mueller Stahl is a familiar name because he was once an Oscar nominee (for Best Supporting Actor in ""Shine""), but I have never really seen him. This is a showcase role for him, and most likely will get him another nomination at least. Vincent Cassel chews scenery in another role reminiscent of his role in ""Derailed"" of a psychotic criminal. Naomi Watts underplays her naive role and lets the actors outshine her, yet she is still quietly effective in her own way.But the star of the film is really Viggo Mortensen. He is really very convincing as the astute and confident driver who climbs up the ranks in the Russian mafia. He was as effective in his scenes of gore and violence (that bloody nude bathhouse fight scene would most likely be remembered for many years to come); as he was in tender scenes with Naomi Watts (and Vincent Cassel!). As he can project a genuine sense of evil and dread, he can similarly show sincerity and concern.This film would not be easy for everyone to watch. The violence and gore levels are high. But being very interesting and rare trip down the Russian underground, plus the tour-de-force acting, makes this film a definite must see. As I said about ""The Departed"" last year (coincidentally another gangster film), this may be the first potential Oscar Picture nominee I have seen this year.",Eastern Promises

78,Witchfinder-General-666,Excellent Crime Thriller From Cronenberg,8,2 June 2008,"David Cronenberg must be one of the most innovative directors alive with his unique personal style of film-making. As a Horror enthusiast I was at first a bit worried when Cronenberg left the Horror genre behind in order to dabble in other genres. Fortunately, seeing the great ""A History Of Violence"" in 2005 immediately proved my worries to be unjustified, and ""Eastern Promises"" of 2007 is yet another great film from Cronenberg. Cronenberg's recent films may not share the delightful weirdness of his earlier films such as ""Rabid"", ""Scanners"", ""The Fly"", ""Shivers"" or ""The Dead Zone"" but they maintain the high quality of Cronenberg's repertoire. ""Eastern Promises"" is a stunning portrayal of organized crime and easily one of the most recommendable films of the year 2007. After a Russian teenager dies at childbirth in a London hospital, Anna (Naomi Watts), an English midwife of Russian descent, tries to find the girl's family in order to avoid for the baby daughter to end up in an orphanage. After Anna's alcoholic uncle refuses to translate the girl's diary, Anna brings it to Semyon (Armin Mueller Stahl), a Russian restaurant owner, in order to have it translated. Samyon, however, happens to be involved in the Russian mafia, as is his slightly psychotic son Kiril (Vincent Cassell) and his 'driver' Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen)...The performances are excellent. Naomi Watts is not only very beautiful, but also a great actress and she is excellent in the lead here. Viggo Mortensen may be most famous for the ""Lord Of The Rings"" films, but he is a great and highly versatile actor whose repertoire includes many memorable performances. His performance as the silent Nikolai here is once again brilliant. Equally great is Vincent Cassel, easily one of the greatest French (and even European) actors of his generation, who is once again very believable as the crazed Kiril. To people familiar with Cronenberg's films it shouldn't be necessary to mention that the film has an incredible atmosphere. A reviewer from Russia has complained that the film's typically Russian sequences are not really authentic. This is something I cannot judge, of course, as I don't know how Russian mafia members in London really are, and neither can I judge, of course, how good the Russian is that the characters speak, as I can't speak the language myself. What I can say is that the film seems highly authentic. I am sure Croenberg as well as the actors involved did their research, as it all seems very realistic. Still, as I said, I might be wrong with this opinion, which is, of course, no guarantor that it really is realistic, but to someone who isn't acquainted with any real-life mobsters (which should be the case with most reviewers as well as other users on this site), this film seems more realistic than most of the countless films about the mob in the States, especially as this couldn't possibly be misinterpreted in a glorifying manner. Gritty, violent, uncompromising and straight to the point ""Eastern Promises"" is a stunning, highly atmospheric and excellently acted film that is among the must-sees of the year 2007. Highly recommended!",Eastern Promises

It is very violent, BUT not excessive, The violent scenes are shown, not just talked about or hinted at.There is one fight scene, (in a bath house) & the 2 guys are naked, nothing is hidden. These scenes & a few others make this an excellent film for me, they came across as very realistic.The acting by the entire cast is first rate, award worthy ensemble acting.,. The biggest name actors in the cast are not yet major players.Viggo Morternson & Naomi Watts are not a couple here, BUT I sure would love to see these two, in a romantic love story,.Two older actors who have been around sound stages for decades.Seynouur Cassell & Armin Mueller-Stalh are outstanding as they usually are.

80,aharmas,Shades of The Godfather,9,9 September 2007,"Two words: Viggo Mortessen. He is the man who will be watched comes Oscar time. His performance is a marvel to watch as he combines his physical acting in combination with the ability to develop characters from deep inside, showing complexity rarely seen in American films. Viggo plays a man who is in employ of a Russian godfather figure. He has developed close ties with the son of the patriarch, though the extent and nature of this relationship remains unclear throughout the film, we know that there is a bond will play an important part throughout the film.Through a series of coincidences during a transitory period in the wars between various groups, a nurse comes into possession of a diary that contains some sensitive information. Inadvertently, she walks into the lion's liar and becomes acquainted with several key players. As the story becomes more and more complex, things become more intense and riskier for all the parties involved.Executions are ruthless, decisions are made without regard to consequence and the feelings of the innocent. Cronenberg directs with a sure hand and is put together scenes that recall Coppola at his best while making the original Godfather. There are layers of complexity bringing together the history of the families, the ethnic tensions, the feelings between the killers and their own families, all down much economically than Coppola did. This film runs under two hours and makes quite an impact, leaving its audience wanting more, in particular about the future of the Viggo character... a man who is able to handle the worst of situations and might have more ambitions than are obvious when we first meet the players.This film is not for the weak, with plenty of graphic violence, and some emotional moments that people might not be able to handle. After all, the game is played differently, depending on who the players are, and this time the players are ruthless.",Eastern Promises
81,Enchorde,Very good character driven thriller,7,14 June 2008,"Recap: A young pregnant girl is rushed to hospital where they manage to save the baby but not the girl. The girl is young but unknown and all she leaves behind (except the baby) is a diary in Russian. It falls into possession of a midwife who tries to find the girls family so that the baby can be raised by family. The diary leads her to a Russian restaurant and unknown to her, straight in to the midst of the Vory v Zakone, Russian organized crime.Comments: With David Cronenberg at the helm, this movie turned out very well. You can see and sense the amount of preparation, you can see that everyone takes it seriously. The result is a good thriller with well-defined and established characters performed very well by good actors and actresses. That is actually the best part of the movie the effort put into this. You can enjoy a completely plausible and well-performed story, almost as if you experienced it yourself. Especially Viggo Mortensens portrait of an advancing thief in the organisation is spectacular, but also Naomi Watts', Vincent Cassels' and Armin Ueller-Stahl's performances are very good. Among what I liked best is that neither character is simpleminded or without different aspects. There are good sides to the bad guys and bad sides to the good guys. And neither side of anyone feels false.Unfortunately, and what keeps me from giving top score, are the story. Sure, it is intense enough. There are no dull moments, no long stretches. There are suspense and development all the time, so you have no trouble keeping interest. But the code is unfortunately a little too easy to crack. Sure, I didn't predict the ending ten minutes in, but I was always one step ahead of the story, knowing what next step would be. No major twists and surprises. And that may be the only thing lacking. That is what I think separates this very good movie from being great.7/10",Eastern Promises
82,Jonny_Numb,Beautiful...One of 2007's Best,9,23 September 2007,"Like the ill-fated Seth Brundle in his remake of ""The Fly,"" director David Cronenberg's career (spanning over 3 richly satisfyingand plenty disturbingdecades) has always been in a state of shape-shifting metamorphosis. The born-and-bred Canadian started out in the field of gooey, low-budget sci-fi/horror hybrids that dared to have an intellectual resonance (among them: ""They Came from Within""; ""The Brood""; ""Scanners""), and are now rightly regarded as classics in a genre that is all too frequently dismissed by mainstream critics. But it was the much-praised ""Dead Ringers"" (1988) that, for my tastes, saw the director pressing forward in an altogether different directionover the following decade, he would bob and weave through his previous tropes in films like ""Naked Lunch,"" ""Crash,"" and ""eXistenZ,"" but it wasn't until 2005's ""A History of Violence"" that Cronenberg became both a critic's darling and a box-office success. Some cited the film as a betrayal of all the director had done before, with a conventional tone and plot relatively devoid of the imaginative grotesqueness prevalent in his horror features; I saw it as merely another fascinating (albeit flawed) step in Cronenberg's ceaselessly interesting evolution.If ""A History of Violence"" was a bid for mainstream acceptance, ""Eastern Promises,"" in many ways, is a step back into the world of more traditional Cronenberg. I am always wary of films that derive high levels of praise from critics, especially when the director becomes the focusone need look no further than ""Inland Empire"" to see accolades heaped upon a director's established pedigree rather than the movie itself. But ""Promises"" is a different kind of beastunlike ""History,"" wherein the director's transition to detailing the lives of small-town folk turned upside-down by brutality was clunky and awkward at times, this film shows Cronenberg fully in his element. The violence here is no less bodily-oriented than in his earliest films, and the sexual attitudes shy away from prurient titillation, replaced instead with an awkward discomfort that permeated the likes of ""Dead Ringers"" and ""Crash."" Cronenberg has never been one to shy away from graphic shocks, but unlike the current wave of horror hacks, he realizes the strong effect of violence perpetrated by and inflicted upon characters we care about.The film, set in London, begins with two sequences that essentially shape the rest of the narrative: an execution perpetrated by a Russian gangster's mentally disabled son; and a 14-year old prostitute who dies during childbirth. Anna (the always stunning Naomi Watts), the midwife who presides over the girl in her final minutes, gets hold of her journal, which her uncle Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski) translates. It is quickly discovered that the girl was drugged and raped in the hands of another group of Russian gangsters operating in London, headed by the pervasively sinister Semyon (Armin-Mueller Stahl) and his hotheaded son, Kirill (Vincent Cassel). Seemingly on the outside of all this is Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), the mob driver to whom Anna gets close, and may be hiding more than he seems. To reveal any more of the plot would be criminal, since the film flows in such a richly character-based way that a big part of watching it is drinking in the performances (all of which are consistently strong). That's not to say there aren't surprises within the narrativebut Cronenberg treats them naturalistically, not like the loud punchlines that permeate the last 30 seconds of a ""Saw"" sequel.While this film contains setpieces that are on par with (if not transcendent of) the director's previous works, they are rendered even more disturbing due to the grounded-in-reality tone (take, for instance, a brutal scene in a Turkish Bath, played without a trace of superhero agility); thus, it is almost insulting to call ""Eastern Promises"" a throwbackif anything, it is bound to a more progressive film-making path. Yet it does show Cronenberg's artistic ambitionshis control of character, his understanding of narrative, his penchant for beautiful framing (even of the most repellent acts and images) has only gotten stronger over the yearswith ""Eastern Promises,"" a cast of skilled actors and a distinctly higher budget seem like a tribute to his long-established talents, rather than a ""sell out."" Additionally, the story (scripted by Steven Knight) is one of the most compelling I have witnessed all year, and kept me engaged from start to finishlike I said before, this is not a film centered around twists, turns, and the head-spinning confusion they often produceit is based on emotion and knowledge of character. Even more so than ""A History of Violence,"" ""Promises"" sustains a very delicate emotional balance juxtaposed against scenes of gut-wrenching brutality that is very impressive. The result of all these intertwining elements is a film that mines a richly satisfying, moving tale out of what seems like a very scant running time (over the course of 96 minutes, we feel that more emotional and aesthetic territory has been covered than some movies twice as long).Simply put, ""Eastern Promises"" is one of the year's best films in a year that's been abundant with excellent films. As I sat watching the closing credits, processing what I had just seen, one adjective stood above all others: ""Eastern Promises"" is a BEAUTIFUL film. Of course, other adjectives, like ""disturbing"" and ""brutal"" followed quickly after, but even in its physical and emotional anguish, its tortured voice-over narration, and the welling tension in the pit of our stomachs, there is a raw humanity that is not imbued with contrived heroics or the guarantee of a Happy Ending. While the film does conclude on an ambiguously hopeful note (actually bearing some similarity to ""History""'s close), Cronenberg and his brilliant cast have done nothing less than earned it. In a just world, ""Eastern Promises"" will earn a Best Picture nod at next year's Oscars (alongside ""Grindhouse""...hey, a man can dream).8.5 out of 10",Eastern Promises

Aside from Cassel's acting, I absolutely love every aspect of this movie. It's a gritty, dark mob thriller with multiple layers set in a wonderfully complex world. Honestly, I'd go so far as to call this film ""The Godfather"" of Russian mob movies- at least, as far as English-speaking mob movies go (I can't claim to be an expert on gangster films in general).

84,Seraphion,A strong story of the Russian mafia underworld,7,10 September 2014,"The movie starts very strongly with such an opening. The main conflict about the baby sets in right then and there after the short opening ends. The pace is quite normal for a story this elaborate. Although I must say that the thing with Nikolai being a deep cover cop is just very much predictable from the cast selection for such an insignificant character at the starters. The parallel conflict within the Vory itself makes this movie more interesting, although it rather ends quite unsatisfactorily. Viggo Mortensen did a great job in getting into character. He did a very good job in making a signature face for his character and doing it stably for during the entire movie.

A new driver for the mob (a very thin Viggo Mortensen) keeps running into Watts, and ends up becoming her protector of sorts. French actor Vincent Cassell plays the jittery, not overly bright son of mob boss Armin M.-Stahl. Almost nobody is what they seem here, and this leads to some pretty wild plot twists. There is some realistic bloodletting, and Mortensen engages in a really wild fight to the death with two thugs near the end. The film is grim and unrelenting, although it comes to a pretty decent ending, and is suggested for mature viewers only.",Eastern Promises
86,Galina_movie_fan,"""I am driver. I go left, I go right, I go straight ahead - that's it.""",7,14 February 2008,"""Eastern promises"" is the first film for David Cronenberg that was shot entirely outside his native Canada and it is the second film of Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen - after ""The History of Violence"" (2005). It should be mentioned that Viggo Mortensen had done a very impressive research for his Oscar-nominated role of Nikolai Luzhin, a modest driver and also an ""undertaker"" and a hit-man for the Russian mafia boss in London. Mortensen alone, without a translator, had traveled across Russia, visiting the Urals Mountains where his character came from, and also stopped in Moscow and St.-Petersburg. Mortensen diligently learned Russian to make the Russian phrases of Siberian Nikolai sound more naturally. He also studied the literature on Russian prisons and their unofficial kings, ""vory v zakone"" or thieves in the law, the most respected and feared criminals. The script was written by Stephen Knight whose previous film on the subject of the emigrants in modern London, ""Dirty Pretty Things"" (2002), proves that he is a talented writer. Sadly, the script is the weakest part of ""Eastern Promises"" and while watching the movie I thought that it had deserved the better writing. The story is predictable from the very beginning and it lacks subtlety. All twists and turns are clearly seen a mile away. Even with the obvious problems in the script, ""Eastern promises"" is an interesting film - intense, gloomy, dark, and violent. David Cronenberg's directing is laconic, non sentimental, almost clinical and always virtuoso. The gruesome fight scene in the Turkish Baths is a masterpiece, the way it was choreographed and shot. Cronenberg must have used the knowledgeable Russian consultants on the set and I was pleasantly surprised that the Russian phrases sound naturally, and pronunciation and intonations of the non-Russian actors were believable. Besides Mortinsen, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Vincent Casselas as Nikolai's horrifying boss and his creepy son, are especially memorable. Surprisingly, Naomi Watts whom I adore in every movie I've seen her, plays the least interesting character and I attribute it to the weaknesses of the script.",Eastern Promises
87,RainDogJr,vory v zakone,9,28 May 2008,"For me It has been always really interesting the subject of the Cosa Nostra, the Japanese Yakuza, the Irish Mob, etc and of course films are a perfect way to know more and at the same part are part of the reason of why I began to be interested in this subject. Watching the documentary featured on the Eastern Promises DVD made me realize about the wonderful research that was made for the film, specially the great research that Viggo Mortensen did in Russia in order to make a more credible performance with a believable accent, especially for Russian audiences. The film itself is a magnificent way to know something about the behaviour of Russian gangsters (vory v zakone) in London but not just that, it is not the classic view into the organized crime, is more a view into the entire world's society, set and focusing in the present days of London.Anna Khitrova, the character of Naomi Watts, is a midwife and a ""normal"" person from a good family. She will be part of the drama part of the story, getting closer and closer to a world that she and the rest of us knows that is there but is still is a really unknown world. What I like of this film is that you are being entertaining by the interesting subject of the behaviour and believes of the Russian gangsters but also being concerned about a story, which you know is a consequence of the acts of the Russian gangsters, that involves a subject that is really strong and difficult but also very real in our world, with a young girl who use to believe that a ""place from the Bible"" could be real, believing that London could be like that dream place. One of Viggo Mortensen's best performances to date is for the memorable character of Nikolai Luzhin who is the principal one and the main connection between the gangsters and the ""normal"" people. Apart of the drama story we are watching and enjoying all the classic process that a man must cover in order to be part of the family business. All this process, of course,is the one of Nikolai who was just the driver of Kirill (Vincent Cassel), the son of the boss in the family. Eventually Nikolai will get closer to the family business becoming one of the men that the family can trust. This is a great and usual view to a crime organization, focusing in the subjects and behaviours that are very representative for the vory v zakone: the family, the meaning of the tattoos,etc. In his story with the vory v zakone, Nikolai looks like a true professional but you still know that he is not the classic one because of some acts that a member of the family business wouldn't do. And is the family subject the most important in the film so the character of Mortensen is unique because he is alone, in a foreign country and with a life or dead mission that leaves the question: does violence can be justify? As Mortensen claims in the documentary of the DVD, Cronenberg does not answer that question. Still Nikolai can be there along with Donnie Brasco (portrayed in Cinema by Johnny Depp), you know why.Conclusion: Eastern Promises is not one of Cronenberg very finest just because the guy made Videodrome, The Fly and some others. But has wonderful performances by a great and unusual cast, a great story, a wonderful research and a wonderful setting. Yes this is a wonderful film.",Eastern Promises
88,eric262003,Cronenberg Delivers Yet Again,9,28 February 2016,"The opening scenes in David Cronenberg's ""Eastern Promises"" has a man seated in a barber's chair in London, we are left asking ourselves, how will this man die in his own blood. Cronenberg offers his viewers the freedom to make assumptions as well as the liberation for the unfortunate victim not expecting his fate when the straight-edged razor will inflict him in the throat or to when he tries to kick out from possible death by kicking his feet. This commencing scenario is the tip of the iceberg and sets the tone for what is to be a wild ride in thinly plotted low-budgeted film. The following scene takes place in a pharmacy where a cold, drenched bare- footed teenage girl walks into the shop. She is bloody and pregnant and is quickly rushed to Trafalgar General Hospital. This is where we meet a midwife named Anna (Naomi Watts). The young girl dies, but her baby survives though covered in blood. Nobody can identify who the mother is, but all we know is that she's left a journal written in Russian and a restaurant card. Like an amateur detective, Anna sets out on what is a simple assignment to ascertain the dead mother's identity and the biological father of her newborn baby. Two things that need to be unravelled during these opening scenes is that Cronenberg is oblivious to his own actions and that he is much to self-aware of himself that he is pulling of similar traits that he does in most of his movies. Very similar to the opening scenes Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" where Frank Vincent's Billy Batts gets beaten mercilessly to death, Cronenberg's self-awareness stems to the brink of self-parody can't go incognito towards an endless fetching case of aberration. His method of acting is in-your-face and extremely physical. The things that people seem to neglect like the social, public and even spiritual spectrum all materializes through the physical existence and that the spokes of our wheels runs entirely on blood. This is something he doesn't forget let alone something won't let us forget either. So now we have Anna up to the initiative in the bloody atmosphere as she welcomes a new life for this child. Her investigation leads her to man named Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) who runs the Trans-Siberian Restaurant who's a potential man in lying in his own pool of blood. Upfront he runs a very successful Ukrainian restaurant, but is also a powerful mob leader underground. He knows that this diary could spell the demise of himself and his entire empire. One of his cronies is his chauffeur Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen in his second Cronenberg film). The first Cronenberg-Mortensen pairing was ""The History of Violence"" and the alliance between these two are quite stimulating. Mortensen truly feels at home in Cronenberg's visions as he knows his character is up against his worst to come. He seems adjusted to his director's obsessions. For most of the movie Nikolai spends most of the time facing off against Seymon's son Kirill (Vincent Cassel). Having these two opponents is the sign of perfect casting let alone brilliant chemistry. They're close in height, class, colouring and even close in age and both possess handsome features. A classic case of good versus evil. Cassel's menacing appeal is the pivotal reason why he seems to be type-cast as a villain in American films. However in ""Eastern Promises"", he's playing a more prominent villain because he's able to embody insecurity and has enough gusto to reveal his true self successfully. This might be one of Cassel's best English-speaking performances. Even though the penmanship has changed with Steven Knight was the scriptwriter here, the family resemblance between ""Eastern Promises"" and ""A History of Violence"" is quite similar that goes beyond Mortensen in the starring roles in both. Both films feature a vicious mobster involved in the lives of ordinary solid citizens. The narratives are both executed to perfection. Cronenberg skims through the narrative without actually rushing through the movie and gives great depths towards the set-pieces nearby like the Russian Mafia initiation (where the applicant must stand in the nude in front of a judging panel) and an ugly violent mob altercation in a steam room.The one thing that makes ""Eastern Promise"" inferior to ""A History of Violence"" is that it was way too compulsory and not as endearing and complex as ""A History of Violence"". Aside from that minor nitpick, ""Eastern Promises"" delivers entertainment in the way that David Cronenberg has mastered.",Eastern Promises
89,lewiskendell,Excellent movie.,7,10 April 2010,"Eastern Promises is not a pleasant film. Imagine a darker version of A History of Violence with a heavy emphasis on the Russian mob. The plots of those two movies aren't similar, but the uncomfortable realism of them both is the common thread that binds them together. I don't consider myself squeamish, but Eastern Promises made me positively cringe at times. Not at any excessive violence or profanity, but because it immerses you in a story and a world that's quite possibly not very different from reality. It all seems so realistic, that it reminded me that these kind of events are the actual lives of real people out there. The quality of the acting is just that outstanding. I can't say that I loved watching Eastern Promises, but I can say that it was a very good movie. Quality and enjoyment don't always go hand-in-hand. I recommend it to anyone who can appreciate a grim movie about a bleak world.",Eastern Promises

David Cronenberg created another great thriller after HISTORY OF A VIOLENCE that is another must see. I am very surprised how good the Russian accent of Viggo Mortensen and Vincent Cassel was. They played their roles very cool and professionally that deserves great respect. I was never bored and it's not a fast paced movie but entertains more as a character study about a Russian mafia family filled with some bloody scenes. I warn you that these ones are very hard what I didn't see long time before. Then what I liked was the direction and cinematography. This story let me understand a little how the Russian mafia works. There is a happy end a la Hollywood with a clear message but now I don't want tell you any more. Just see it. Final vote: 7/10.,Eastern Promises

(R)After a rootless teenage émigré dies in childbirth, midwife Watts looks to get the girl's diary translated, turning to restaurant owner (and Russian mafioso) Mueller-Stahl, who was perhaps involved in the girl's tragic fate; Mortensen is the gangster's brooding chauffeur who also gets involved, though his motivations are far more unclear. Set in London but populated almost entirely by figures descending much farther east (Russian, Chechen, Kurdish, etc.), this crime drama is another one of Cronenberg's brutally violent but compulsively watchable feats, purposeful and precise while dealing with muddy ethics and ambiguous character definition. Watts is poignant but often passive, while Mortensen is arresting to watch, affixed by restrained danger that almost smolders off the screen (a plot twist late in the movie gives him greater depth, but also unfortunately vanquishes some of the enigmatic qualities that made him so fascinating to study). A couple plot threads are tied up a little too neatly (and easily) during the final stretch, but a minor quibble. Unforgettable fight scene set in a Turkish bath is, like the rest of the movie, not for the squeamish.85/100",Eastern Promises
92,OJT,Cronenbergs best - possibly his masterpiece,10,25 January 2008,"I've always liked David Cronenbergs twisted and different kind of film making since Scanners (The Fly, EXistenZ, Crash, Naked lunch, Videodrome, Dead ringers), but he took his film-making to a new level with A History of Violence.But this time he takes the whole idea of film-making to a new level of perfection. He tells the story like it was one of Woody Allen's last British films. Great and compelling storytelling, where every detail is superbly attached to the screen, combined with great acting and outstanding research.You actually believe ever single person in the film. They are all Russians. No fake accents or bad Russian-like pronunciation.The acting is terrific. Viggo Mortensen deserves the Oscar he's nominated for, and Armin Mueller-Stahl makes a fantastic character of the mafia boss. He's always been good, but this is his best so far. You actually see both the devil and the saint in his eyes at the same time. But every actor in this film seem to make their best performances. Naomi Watts is brilliant, and so is Vincent Cassel. Astonishing.There are many memorable scenes as the film moves along. The pace is quiet, but the excitement is great. You know what is going to happen all the time, until then you're baffled by something completely surprising, which makes new suspense enter the scene.I like the way Cronenberg has evolved as a director. He'll soon become one of the most important ones, if he carry on like he's done for the latter years. Even the little violence in the film is superb.

She soon makes the acquaintance of the mysterious Nikolai (Viggo Mortenson) but it remains to be seen whether he is friend or foe.First of all, in my opinion this is Viggo Mortenson's best performance to date, one which was deservedly rewarded with an Oscar nomination. Naomi Watts delivers a solid performance as well though she has been better elsewhere. The supporting cast is pretty good but no-one really stands out.Cronenberg's direction is workmanlike and I don't really have anything to say about it, good or bad. He brings the Steven Knight screenplay to life with unsparing violence and sexuality; no surprise if you're familiar with his previous films.The thing that holds the story back a bit is a lack of scope in comparison to some of the other, more celebrated gangster films like ""The Godfather"" and ""GoodFellas"". However, this may be a case of criticizing a film for what it isn't rather than what it is.Nevertheless, here Cronenberg demonstrates once again his ability to take an action-oriented crime drama and infuse it with a depth uncommon for films of that type.",Eastern Promises
94,dunmore_ego,Broken Promises.,6,6 April 2009,"Child prostitution rings! Russian mob wars! Blond American chick in mortal danger from Euro assassins! Heaven forfend! Not to worry - David Cronenberg's EASTERN PROMISES has none of these.Oh, it promises all that and more in the breathless trailers, but when we examine Steven Knight's screenplay, we realize something director Cronenberg does not - EASTERN PROMISES makes absolutely no sense.Anna (Naomi Watts) is an American nurse in London, who finds a Russian diary on the body of a 14-year-old mother who dies in childbirth. To find any clue to place the baby with its next of kin, Anna asks her Russian uncle (Jerzy Skolimowski) to translate the diary; she also follows the trail of a business card found in the diary, to a Russian restaurant owned by Semyon (avuncular, yet sinister, Armin Mueller-Stahl).Semyon's son, Kirill (Vincent Cassel) hangs around Semyon's street muscle, Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen) like that little yapping dog, Chester, in the Warner Bros. Sylvester cartoon, Dr. Jerkyl's Hide (""That's my Alf!"").These early scenes do well to create an aura of uneasiness around the Russians. It falls apart just about the time we see Viggo stark frontal nekkid. You heard me, ladies...Semyon betrays Nikolai to the Russian Mob on the pretense that Nikolai is Kirill, his son who was ordered sacrificed. But Nikolai dispatches the assassins in a nude steam room scene that can't GET any steamier for the ladies, with his magnificent ballsac doing most of the work.There are two big ""reveals"" in EASTERN PROMISES. The first is Viggo's magnificent ballsac, the second is that Nikolai is a cop. Undercover.And the movie is officially euthanized by its own makers.After all the research that went into the Mob tatts on Viggo's body, after all that skulking around and winding us up, now we don't have to fear for Anna any more - we know she has a protector in the form of Aragorn! How could any cave-trolls get near her now? Cronenberg makes a great-looking film (but that's probably more attributable to his cinematographer, Peter Suschitzky), but I'm not letting him off the hook for the absurd twists that negate the whole reason for us to be concerned with these people's fates.Like his HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, Cronenberg's story does not seem to take place in any real world we know. Wouldn't the Russian Mob - after sending two assassins to kill Kirill and failing - send more assassins to finish the job? And when they find out Nikolai is not Kirill, wouldn't they go after the real Kirill? Wouldn't they sanction Semyon for trying to bait-and-switch them? And whether Nikolai is Kirill or not, wouldn't they send someone to finish the job while he lies prostrate in hospital? None of this happens. It's Cronenberg's world of No Consequences.The gore in EASTERN PROMISES is not gratuitous, but when it comes, Cronenberg never flinches. The naked shower battle is intense, with glinty knives scarring across backs and stabbed into eyes, yet Cronenberg simply uses gaping wound holes to distract us from the gaping plot holes.Firstly, it's not a child prostitution ""ring"" if just one fourteen-year-old girl was raped; it's not a Russian mob war if there are no followup assassination attempts; and Anna suddenly seems completely safe and therefore irrelevant, the baby becomes a McGuffin, Kirill becomes homosexual, and Semyon is simply arrested by local police. After showing us a Russian underculture that is hard and heavy, Semyon's arrest is ridiculous; uh, guess the Russian gangs didn't want to interrupt official police business.In a final shot, Nikolai is seen taking on the Godfather role in Semyon's stead. So an undercover cop who is trying to bring down the organization is now running it. And all this while I thought There IS No Keyser Soze.",Eastern Promises

It deals with how the birth of a little girl in a London hospital starts a chain of events, that draws an innocent nurse deeper and deeper into the hidden world of crime that some Russian gangs established right in the heart of the United Kingdom.The movie shines through a prominent cast, where at least all the bigger roles are played by well-known actors. The plot is interesting enough to keep the audience entertained and delivers some twists that you might not expect. You can see, that there has been quite a budget for this film, even though the rather cheap blood effects would sometimes make you think differently. Unfortunately, I didn't really catch fire. Maybe the characters are just a bit too one-dimensional at times, or maybe they're too close to what we already know from many movies alike, but even though I felt entertained throughout the whole play-time, this isn't a movie I could connect to very much.All in all it is nevertheless a very well written and directed mafia movie, that will surely find its fans in the genre.

98,bobsgrock,The best of Cronenberg.,8,11 April 2008,"Not being a huge fan of the horror genre, I never cared for anything that David Cronenberg ever did. After watching A History of Violence, I still felt the same as I thought that film to be rather crude and unnecessarily brutal. This one is much the same, but unlike A History of Violence, there is a good story behind it as we watch Viggo Mortensen play a Russian mob driver who becomes involved with a midwife that gives birth to a daughter that has dark ties to the family Mortensen works for. This film works because as the pieces come together, we can see that no matter does happen, the consequences will be harsh and shocking. The acting is terrific with Mortensen deserving an Oscar nomination, Watts playing the beautiful and talented person she is, and Vincent Cassel in an underrated performance as the volatile son of the Russian head. As with all Cronenberg films, the violence is terrifyingly graphic, and the bathhouse scene is one of the most shocking ever put to cinema. Although some scenes just seem to be useless and drag the film down, I felt this was the best of Cronenberg; a smart, brutal, yet sophisticated picture that is very dark and brooding. Hopefully, more like it are on the way.",Eastern Promises
99,mstomaso,The London Branch of the Russian Mob will Decide the Fate of an Orphaned Baby.,8,22 September 2007,"The powerfully creative force of David Cronenberg has finally been mastered. The very erratic but sometimes intensely brilliant director has finally succeeded, in his most recent two films, to subordinate himself to the story he wants to tell. Stylistically, this film contains many Cronenberg elements - an intense interest in the human body, short but wholly affective bursts of graphic bloody violence, some ambiguous characters and every last drop of acting talent squeezed out of the cast. But it also lacks the unreality, complexity and ultimate ambiguity of most of Cronenberg's repertoire.Naomi Watts gives a stellar and very sympathetic performance as a young nurse in a London hospital who has just watched a very young Russian mother die giving birth to a healthy baby girl. She finds a diary which leads her to search for a translator. Her strained relationship with her native Russian uncle prevents her from getting help from him at first, so, unbeknownst to her, she, instead contacts a local crime lord who is is indemnified by the diary itself.The Russian boss' driver and cleaner (and I don't mean he does windows) is Nikolai (Viggo Mortenson). Nikolai is as intelligent and ambitious as the mobster's alcoholic and sexually repressed son (nicely performed by Vincent Cassel) is not. Mortenson and Cassell both nail their roles. Mortenson is not quite as believable here as he was in History of Violence (despite the much less believable subject matter of that film). I do not see this role or performance worthy of an Oscar nomination, but the Academy and I rarely see eye-to-eye and the aficionados seem to be in love with Viggo lately. He is great in this role, but anybody familiar with his repertoire knows he can do better.Cronenberg's direction is, as previously noted, less visible than usual here. I've already hinted at the film's unobtrusive use of some of his usual themes, but it's also worth mentioning that Cronenberg is definitely evolving. He has always had a very good eye - for the unnerving as well as the beautiful, and sometimes for a Lynchian hybrid between art and horror. But in Eastern Promises, Cronenberg directs some remarkable camera work.The easy way out for Eastern Promises, is to simply say that 'if you liked ""A History of Violence"" you will like this. It's really not that simple. Sure the films share a director and an ambiguous male lead played by Viggo Mortenson, but they really have nothing at all to do with each other. Eastern Promises is far more realistic - its brutality is constrained to a few short and intensely violent scenes - and it maintains a steadier pace. Is it a better film? No, but it is slightly more accessible. It is a very good film, and an interesting stage in the evolution of Cronenberg's career.Strongly recommended for fans of organized crime films and fans of Cronenberg and Watts. Recommended, but less strongly, for fans of Mortenson.",Eastern Promises
100,vithiet,"Good performances, good movie for an ok story",7,20 January 2019,This was recommended by friends and is usually not my kind of movie. The story was not all that original but the great acting and the directing made it worth watching. A very decent drama-thriller if that's your thing.,Eastern Promises
101,brchthethird,"Conventional, but still distinctly Cronenberg",7,19 October 2014,"EASTERN PROMISES is a late-period offering from David Cronenberg and while it only touches on his body fixation, the story is thoroughly engrossing and backed up by some excellent performances. The gist of the story is that a Russian girl dies in childbirth, and the attending nurse (Naomi Watts) discovers a diary in the girl's personal effects which she takes home with her in hopes that she can find the name of a relative or an address of some kind. This search brings her into contact with a Russian mob family who might have something to do with the girl, but are also dealing with issues of their own. The father is played by Armin Mueller-Stahl, the son by Vincent Cassel and the driver by Viggo Mortensen.So, going in order: Armin Mueller-Stahl is one of those actors that you would recognize if you saw him in a movie, but might not remember his name. He usually does a decent job, but here he was outstanding. He made being authoritative and menacing look so effortless. Vincent Cassel also did an excellent job as his ne'er-do-well son. He brought a sleazy quality to his character that made him really unlikeable, but at the same time pitiful. Then there's Viggo Mortensen, who I think gives his best performance to date here as Nikolai, the driver with a mysterious past. He is soft-spoken, but also has a certain amount of gravitas which adds weight to his performance. Finally, Naomi Watts is serviceable as the nurse who gets in over her head. I wouldn't say she was at the level of the other members of the cast, but she didn't stick out too much.Story-wise, the film was rather restrained. It continued Cronenberg's recent trend of letting his body horror elements take a backseat and letting the drama unfold in a more conventional way. There aren't any earthshaking twists, but there are a few welcome surprises. What I liked, even though it could have been explored more fully, is the roles of tattoos in Russian mafia culture. Overall, I enjoyed that aspect of the film the most. There was also some of Cronenberg's trademark graphic violence, punctuated in a couple short but effective scenes. However, the centerpiece of the film is a fight in a bathhouse between Viggo Mortensen and some Chechen gangsters. Most impressive is that he does it completely in the nude with his tattoos in full view, making it a character-building moment as well as a thrilling fight scene.Overall, while it dials back on what Cronenberg made his name doing, it is an interesting story with excellent performances across the board. I'm still not sure what the title has to do with the story as a whole, other than Russians are from Eastern Europe, but for what it's worth I liked it a lot. Save for the narrative being a little too divided at times, this new ""conventional"" Cronenberg works, and I enthusiastically recommend it.",Eastern Promises
102,ElijahCSkuggs,Aleksander Emelianenko Is Badass,9,21 September 2007,"Now I've seen Rabid, Scanners, Videodrome, The Fly, Crash, Spider, History of Violence and now this. Why has it taken me this long to realize this guy is one of the best? I enjoyed all of the movies above.....well not Rabid so much, but it was still alright. Cronenberg is now one of my favorite directors. Not for just the fact he knows how to direct a scene or an actor. But his stories are always intriguing, interesting and down-right cool! And everybody this is one cool flick.The main story begins with Doctor Anna (Watts) rescuing a baby from a dying mother. While trying to do the right thing, she makes a dire mistake. A completely accidental mistake, but one that can affect a whole lot of persons lives. Cue the Russian mafia. The side story revolving around a Russian crime family and their mistakes is just as entertaining as Anna's dilemma. I kept on looking at the time on my watch...not because I was bored, but due to me dreading that the movie was getting closer and closer to ending. Eastern Promises is full of amazing direction, gorgeous cinematography, wonderful acting, fantastic dialogue, intelligent writing.....the movie to me has no faults. I wasn't bored for a moment. Intriguing, powerful, emotional, funny....this movie's got it down. Cronenberg's got it down. Viggo, Vincent and Armin all got it down. If this isn't recognized come Oscar time....I'm gonna stick a bicycle horn up my butt and squeeze. Look for the edit come Oscar time if it's not nominated.

103,jaredmobarak,Good eveningEastern Promises,9,25 September 2007,"I have been a David Cronenberg fan ever since my college portfolio review, where the professors, looking over a piece I did in high school, asked if I had ever seen Videodrome. Since then, I have continued my quest to see everything he has done. I'm not quite there, but over the past few years, I have been allowed to see his work on the big screen. First was his taut psychological thriller Spider and second was the film that seems to have made him a bit of a household name of late, A History of Violence. The thing with Cronenberg, though, is that he is meticulous and uncompromising in his vision. Where seeing Spider was a delight at a Dipson Theatre, Violence was much less of a good experience. I need to revisit that film in the quiet and dark of my own living room because the audience members filling that AMC screening were out of their element. They laughed at the sex, cheered at the brutality, and talked throughout. Cronenberg needs to fully envelope your mind in order to be enjoyed and thankfully his new film Eastern Promises does not disappoint in those regards. Its subtlety and nuance showed me that he has hit a bit of a renaissance and is hearkening back to the days of his masterpiece Dead Ringers. If this film says anything about his current work, I need to wipe the slate clean on Violence and see it again as soon as possible.Filmed from a script by Steven Knight, whose last indie success was the gem Dirty Pretty Things, Eastern Promises tells the story of a world containing a very real brutality only thinly veiled from view of its London streets. When a midwife of Russian descent comes across a young girl who dies during childbirth, she can't know that her actions will embroil her right in the middle of a mob war. The girl had with her a diary, spilling all her secrets and connections to the most notorious crime family in the city. That family is in the midst of a feud, the sons fighting each other and letting blood run thick. All the midwife wants is to make sure the baby is cared for back home in Russia, however, the diary has been read by her and her uncle; she has gone too deep to just be left alone.Unlike most films of this genre, we aren't shown the black and white sides of good versus evil. In the middle of everything lies the Russian boss's chauffeur Nikolai. He is quite the enigmafierce, cold, and calculating when put to work, yet compassionate and caring towards our heroine. Is he just the driver? Is he looking to rise in the ranks of the vory v zakone? Or is there something else beneath the surface? The entire film hinges on the believability of this one man's actions. Had the character been played by anyone other than Viggo Mortensen, I don't know if it would have been as successful. Talk about an actor that lays it all on the line for his art; to have an American come in and play a flawless Russian accent, perfect sounding Russian, and partake in a fight scene at a steam bath, where most non-Europeans would be too prudish to even go nude, let alone orchestrate an action sequence, is unfathomable.Cronenberg must be credited for finding a stellar cast throughout, not just with Mortensen. In an interview I read, he says he made sure to cast his characters with actors that were great linguists; the art of accents is like that of a musicians' ear. If true, he has a Philharmonic Orchestra at play. Vincent Cassel, a Frenchman, is impeccable with his Russian, (even more impressive because I've never heard him speak in anything other than a French accent), and Armin Mueller-Stahl, German or Russian or both depending on what year the map was you had for his home country, is a powerhouse at the head of the Russian family. Mueller-Stahl's ability to turn from kindness to violence is uncanny. He is so soft-spoken and genuine that he doesn't need to raise his voice when the rage comes to the surface. That power and force driven out so quietly only makes it more vicious.Let's not forget about our midwife, played by the wonderful Naomi Watts. Truth be told, she doesn't have to do too much rather than play opposite scary men, but she does it well. As the pawn between Mueller-Stahl and Mortensen, she shows a fearlessness that can be commended. Never backing down to the mob, even after she has been threatened, shows a side to her that one wouldn't expect. Maybe she takes too much stock in the kindness shown by Viggo's driver, but either way, her character is written in a believable way and central to the activities at hand.I must warn prospective viewers that this is not a blockbuster Hollywood film. You may hear about the brutality and blood, the extended fight sequence at the bath, (whose final long take of Mortensen crawling along the floor leads to a bold finale to the fight), and the crime underbelly at play, however, it is still a Cronenberg movie through and through. The pacing is very deliberate, the story's intelligence allowed to slowly ferment and be released at the perfect moment. It may cause discomfort from the graphicness, as well as some of the bigotry on display in certain scenes, and may bore some with its sluggish progression, but what it won't do is disappoint those coming in wanting cinematic genius. Maybe I'm biased being the fan I am of this Canadian auteur, yet I can't help shed the worry that Eastern Promises won the top prize at the Toronto Film Festival because of hometown nepotism. Having finally seen it, I think it captured the prize on its own merits.",Eastern Promises
104,crossbow0106,Russian Mob And London,8,27 January 2008,"This is a curious story about the Russian mob in London. Viggo Mortensen, whom I've never seen in any film, does give a stand out performance. He is probably deserving of his Oscar nod, but the movie, which was not nominated for Best Picture, does not deserve it (anyway). The story revolves around a baby born to a young Russian girl, who dies on the operating table. Naomi Watts plays a midwife, who takes an interest in finding out how to inform the mother's family about the birth. I have a problem with her character. After being told that the Russian mob is involved here, she still is at their doorstep. Although her late father is Russian, I don't understand this. Everyone knows that is a dangerous world. Her dedication to her profession is admirable, but she has a naiveté in the film that bothers me a little. That said, otherwise the film is good, except in more than one place I could not understand what the actors were saying. Like I stated above, Viggo Mortensen deserves his recognition. The movie should have been as good as him. Worth your time, but by no means a great film.",Eastern Promises
105,sharky_55,I'm just a driver.,7,30 December 2015,"Naturally, most representations of criminal worlds have two layers - the top is all glitz and glamour, the crown jewels, the front in the money laundering that boasts of the wealth that comes with these sorts of illegal activities like drugs and human trafficking. And then there is the bottom layer, grimy and devoid of morals, which in this film follows Nikolai, the driver of the Russian mob in London, but whom is trusted more than the son of the top boss himself, and is asked to do a lot more than just drive. They frequent in a restaurant that is always buzzing with atmosphere and hosts elderly birthday parties while bodies are being cut up out back, and Seymon oversees both operations with ease. Cronenberg has always been one for bodily horror, and here he does not shy away. But it does not hold the same grotesque power as Videodrome or The Fly; there are two instances of throats being slit, and in each of them the camera lingers much longer than necessary, but the way the blood spurts explosively and excessively is almost comical. The quietly desperate fight sequence in the bath is the best scene in the film, because it does not attempt to overshadow, and it has a vulnerable quality that few films possess whenever the protagonist has to fight more than one person. This stems from the fact that Mortensen is buck naked, which presents every inch of his tattooed body as a target, and each the effect of glancing blow, each bloody wound and the gleam of the knives is magnified intensely. There is Seymon's son, Kirill, who in some films would be a uncompromising brute, but here he carries a hint of a sensitivity about him that suggests that he is putting it on for his father. It is hinted, through the narrative voice-over, that he is a homosexual and unable to even rape the prostitutes, which Seymon viciously reprimands. Cassel's performance is perfectly overeager and willing - see as he uses ice cream humour to lighten the mood of a heavy task, and vigorously smothers the girl gyrating on the stripper pole and demands that he see Nikolai f*ck one of them with his very own eyes - you suspect he is vastly overcompensating and projecting his own insecurities. And then when it all cracks, and he cannot throw a baby into the river like they did with another corpse earlier, we see how his life has been tragically chosen for him. It is unfortunate that the other plot of Naomi Watts' Anna Ivanova is less riveting. There is a tension between her and the ex-KGB father, and hints of a backstory that is not expanded upon (a delightful moment in the next morning, where Anna's father's pride prevents him from apologising openly, but he stumbles through an alternate option of sorts). Her motherly instincts cause her to bump into the mob and its underworld...but not in any tangible way. Cronenberg leans heavily on the diary's voice-over in order to build it up, but shows none of it in his camera. This is by far the cleanest London I have seen on film. The characters, whom have done some despicable things between them, are often bathed in a warm yellow light from overhead, like a hovering halo in the night. In daytime, the streets are pristine (Cronenberg, to his credit, does not toss in a shot of Big Ben or the palace). We see the lavish restaurant front, the top layer, but not the bottom one. It is no surprise that the bath fight has no such glow, but reeks of sterility until the first drop of blood is spilled.Mortensen is what pulls it all together. His accent is not hammy but convincing, at least enough to fool every member of the mob. A different film would establish him as the mole, and create tension by pushing him against moral ambiguity, and making us desperately hope he does not cave, yet also hoping his cover is not blown. Mortensen lives and breaths Nikolai, and when the twist is revealed, it is not so surprising because he does not dive right back to his real identity. With each carefully pronounced syllable, a cigarette ever present in the corner of his mouth, and the ease in which he carries out the duties of the mob, he makes us believe he has earned every single tattoo, and all the horrible things he has done to acquire them. They have not left his eyes.",Eastern Promises
106,MrGKB,"Not quite up to ""A History of Violence,"" but....",8,6 August 2008,"...pretty entertaining viewing thanks to an Oscar-worthy performance by Viggo ""Witness"" Mortensen, a strong one from Naomi ""King Kong"" Watts, and outstanding support from the likes of Vincent ""L'Appartement"" Cassel, Armin ""The Thirteenth Floor"" Mueller-Stahl, Sinéad ""V for Vendetta"" Cusack, Jerzy ""Mars Attacks"" Skolimowski, and others. Cronenberg & Co. deliver up another compelling character study in Mortensen's embodiment of an immigrant Russian mafia ""undertaker"" opposite Watts' grieving London midwife. The accidental meeting of their worlds triggers the conflict that drives this noir-ish crime drama: the midwife comes into possession of a diary that fingers a ""vory v zakone"" family boss for rape and other transgressions. The kicker is that the diary is in Russian, the writer a young, pregnant prostitute who dies in emergency childbirth, and the midwife brings it for translation to the very man it implicates. Needless to say, mayhem ensues.Cronenberg's trademark infatuation with bodily disfigurement manifests itself not only in several violent set-pieces, but as well in the tattooed resumés of the Russians themselves. There's little in the way of ""transformation"" thematic content, another Cronenberg favorite, though there is a transformative revelation of sorts in the final act; ""Eastern Promises"" is primarily about style and character, which it delivers brilliantly. Steven ""Amazing Grace"" Knight's screenplay is tightly written and chock full of quality dialog, Howard ""The Departed"" Shore's music is ethnically evocative, and Peter ""Mars Attacks"" Suschitzky's camera-wrangling is superb.A fine film experience, though not for all tastes.

Similar to the bought-and-paid-for ""****"" ratings we've seen in newspapers for hundreds of movies for decades, they often come after a moviegoer is ""honored"" by seeing a preview.I'm absolutely NOT a fan of David Cronemberg, but I believe in the opportunity for redemption. Thus we went to find out if Mr. Cronenberg could direct a really good movie --- and if Naomi Watts could survive the incredibly stupid role she was stuck with by renowned empty-head Peter Jackson in his recent ape-rampage flick. The answer is a big YES to both questions.EASTERN PROMISES is relentlessly interesting for the entire 90 minutes. It's not a Russian Mafia ""Godfather"" but instead a highly original movie. Any 10 word summary is bound to be a lie, because the story can't be reduced to the usual brief summary. It's good; enough said.Persons who don't like violence in movies are hereby advised that in my opinion there is no gratuitous or excess depiction of violence. After all, Cronenberg-the-redeemed isn't Brian de Palma and there is no full-gush bloodbath in his picture.There are many reasons to choose one film over another. With EASTERN PROMISES, I tried reading between the lines of excessive praise and expected a good (not great) movie. Also, it was a reason to see a film on the big curved screen of Washington DC's AVALON Theatre --- one of our two remaining standalone theaters. Built in 1926, my Mom and Dad used to go there before I was born. The theater is a gem, and deserves our support.",Eastern Promises
108,fwomp,The Entire Cast Makes This A Winner ...Not Just Viggo,8,4 January 2008,"Discovering a David Cronenberg film can be touchy at best. He's one of those hit or miss directors ...or at least he has been. Swinging wildly between the obtuse and the flat-out bizarre, Cronenberg is a challenging film maker to say the least. From his pathetic beginnings as a short film maker to his wobbly movie length debut with STEREO (1969), Cronenberg's early repertoire is, shall we say, less than inspiring. But then he started having fun and came up with the head bursting SCANNERS (1981), which got a ""cult"" label quickly attached to it. Then came the creepy and highly successful VIDEODROME (1983) and  my personal favorite  THE DEAD ZONE (1983) starring a very young Christopher Walken. Even his THE FLY remake was strange enough to entice most movie-goers. And who could forget NAKED LUNCH ('nough said).But then Cronenberg seemed to fall off his success ladder. The stale EXISTENZ and SPIDER were completely uninspired and rehashed old themes. His attempt at a romantic drama in M. BUTTERFLY quickly flittered away with little to no notice from critics or audiences.It appears, however, that Mr. Cronenberg is now back on track with a set of successful films under his belt. A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE (also starring Viggo Mortensen) was a strange beast but exceptionally well executed in 2005. And now with EASTERN PROMISES, Cronenberg has again hit pay-dirt.More of a crime-thriller, Eastern Promises has some great acting by almost the entire cast. Viggo Mortensen (LORD OF THE RINGS) has been singled-out by a few award ceremonies and I find this a bit unfair. Naomi Watts (THE PAINTED VEIL) does just as good a job as Viggo. Her portrayal of a pretty young London nurse trying to help an orphaned baby who's mother was killed by a Russian mob boss is excellent. And so was Vincent Cassel (OCEAN'S THIRTEEN) as the drunken and pitiful Kirill, son of the Russian boss. There's no denying that Viggo's Nikolai is creepy, dangerous and carries a pitch-perfect Ural-Russian accent, but his portions didn't stand out for me anymore than the rest of the cast.The extra features on the DVD are exceptionally interesting, telling the story of how Viggo researched his role, and the importance that Russian criminals place on body art tattoos (something very prevalent in the film).Perhaps it's the pairing of Mortensen and Cronenberg that makes the movies. With two highly praised ones now locked in, this duo seems to know what makes a film fly. Let's hope Cronenberg realizes this and keeps on with his upward success.",Eastern Promises
109,jon.h.ochiai,Dark Promises Shine,10,27 September 2007,"David Cronenberg's ""Eastern Promises"" is a mesmerizing exploration into the nature of good and darkness.

This is an Oscar worthy performance. Cronenberg, Mortensen, and writer Steve Knight immerse us into the world of the ruthless Russian mafia in present day London. This is the mercenary world of slit throats, racketeering, and teenage prostitutes strung out on heroin.As the movie opens, 14 year old Tatiana (Sarah-Jeanne Labrosse) dies while giving birth to her daughter. Mid-wife Anna (Naomi Watts) is determined to uncover the truth about Tatiana and find her child a home. Anna retains Tatiana's diary; however, she does not read Russian. Following a clue, Anna locates restaurant owner Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl). Semyon offers to translate the diary for Anna. He is not what he appears. This seemingly gentle old man is the vilest of humans, and leader of the Russian crime family. His son Kirill (convincing Vincent Cassel) is impetuous and stupidan embarrassing liability for Semyon. Kirill's driver and confidant is Nikolai (Mortensen). Anna meets Kirill and Nikolai during her initial visit with Semyon. Nikolai and Anna have an unspoken affinity. Nikolai is cold, strong, and smart. He strategically positions himself to become a Family member. While becoming aware of an abhorrent and unforgivable act, he must choose between Family loyalty and protecting the strong willed, yet vulnerable Anna (Watts).Cronenberg and Knight's storytelling reveals a shocking twistwhich shall go unsaid. My bud Robert, whom I saw the movie with, thought this unconcealing took the wind out of him with respect to the movie. He has a valid point. I didn't have as severe a reaction. I had thought that ""Eastern Promises"" intended to be a parable of the good and evil in all people: the villain with a vestige of honor or the hero so steeped in blood he becomes unrecognizable. Even with the apparent misdirection of the twist, the parable may still resonate and land. In retrospect, I think Cronenberg is really telling a heroic story of redemption engulfed in all consuming darkness. To that end Cronenberg's resolution is poetically ambiguous. Viggo Mortensen is riveting in what evolves as classic tragedy.Cronenberg captures the brutality of this London underworld. The bath house fight between the naked Nikolai and two knife wielding assassins is merciless, unsettling, and visceral. Cronenberg accomplishes his desired touch and feel. No one gets out of this world without forfeiting a piece of their soul. Nokolai's noble cause is safe guarding Anna's soul.The performances in ""Eastern Promises"" are stellar. Naomi Watts is brilliant. As Anna she evokes the strength of character to champion the innocent, conceding full well that she is overwhelmed by the great forces of evil. Watts is smart and is all heart and courage as Anna. Her touching chemistry with Mortensen is profound to the story. Vincent Cassel is convincing as the loud, but weak Kirill. Cassel humanizes and makes us empathize with the clueless son of the malevolent Semyon. Armin Mueller-Stahl is very scary in a subdued and calculated persona. Mueller-Stahl easily slips between folksy charm and merciless tyrant. The scene where he quietly asks Nikolai to kill an enemy is spellbinding. Mortensen commands the screen. He is such a charismatic presence whether he is fighting for his life in the bath house or leaning silently on Anna's motorcycle. He is truly amazing.David Cronenberg's ""Eastern Promises"" is not without flaws, bizarre missteps or contrived twists. And it is compelling and provocative work. Viggo Mortensen gives a command performance. Given the nature of the story, ""Eastern Promise"" is not for everyone. However, ""Eastern Promises"" is a great movie for those who choose to see it.",Eastern Promises

111,cultfilmfan,Eastern Promises,10,29 September 2007,"The new film Eastern Promises has such a complex and intelligent script that I feel that if I were to discuss the plot in any way that it would ruin just how good a movie this is, so I recommend you see this movie knowing nothing or reading very little about it to fully appreciate the great artistry behind it. For me this was a flawless film that I loved from start to finish. Everyone in front of the camera and behind it was at the top of their game when it comes to things such as direction, script, performances and a lot more. From the beginning of this film I was intrigued and as I got further into the film my mind and eyes were thoroughly processing and enjoying everything I was seeing. The plot is complex as I said before, but it is very compelling because of the fact that we the viewer do not know what to expect and the film takes us in many different directions with it's story and characters that having not read a thing about the film, or talked to anyone about it, then you probably like me will be glued to the screen in anticipation for what will happen in the next scene and just how this incredibly fascinating yet entertaining film will go. Yes the film is very violent at times and may not be for the squeamish, but I think the style and direction that David Cronenberg wanted to go with this script required it in a sense to better have us understand the characters, the lives they live and to sort of give us a background and a psychological study of them. The characters were also well written and well played by the actors portraying them and because the lead characters are such strong and well written characters that when they interact with one another it plays out beautifully. The direction was also stylish and as I said earlier it gave the film the look, feel and personality it needed. The script was excellent from start to finish with well written characters, a truly interesting and faced paced film with a lot of unexpected things going on and going in ways I didn't see the film going, but not once was it ever unbelievable or over the top in a sense that it didn't suit the film. I think the actors went to a lot of work to do some of the scenes required and to speak with accents that sounded real and believable and everything in this film is top notch and award worthy. The film may be too intense and perhaps to violent for some, but as I stated I felt that was necessary for the realism and style that the film needed and to properly do a film with this kind of subject matter and storyline I think it needed to have a more disturbing and sometimes hard to watch tone to it. The film didn't have a slow or boring minute in it's entire running time and it made for some very compelling and entertaining viewing. This is a film made by talented people for an audience that will appreciate an award worthy type of film. The fall was a perfect time to release this film because of awards soon paying attention to films like this and this film certainly needs to be recognized in several categories at the awards and luckily already won a top award at The Toronto International Film Festival. This is one of the most intelligent and yet ruthlessly entertaining films of the year, but done so for adult viewers who appreciate fine films with great talent behind it. Eastern Promises is one of the best films of the year and one that will have people talking about it for awhile because of just how good it is.",Eastern Promises
112,ajs-10,"Sometimes violent, but always enthralling.",8,19 July 2010,"David Cronenberg has directed some really good films over the years, unfortunately there have been one or two duds along the way too. Fortunately this one falls in the 'good' category, which, considering the reviews I have been reading comes as a great relief. The setting is London in modern times.Anna is a midwife who lives with her mother, Helen, and her uncle Stepan is visiting for Christmas. Her father, who was Russian, passed away some years earlier. When a fourteen year old girl is brought into the hospital where Anna works and dies giving birth to a daughter Anna decides to try and track her family down. Her only clue is a business card from a restaurant stuffed into the pages of her dairy which is written in Russian. Anna goes to the restaurant where she meets the owner, Semyon, and his son, Kirill. Seymon offers to translate the girl's diary and Anna agrees. She is met outside by the mysterious chauffeur, Nikolai, who proves to be more than he seems. Little does Anna know she has just entered the Russian criminal underworld, a very dangerous place to be. I will leave my little summary here, don't want to give too much away.A very well made film in a style we have come to expect from David Cronenberg. The story slowly evolves with many twists and turns in the plot to keep the audience interested. Very good performances from all of the main cast, Viggo Mortensen as Nikolai, Naomi Watts as Anna, Armin Mueller-Stahl as Seymon and Vincent Cassel as Kirill.There are some very brutal and graphic scenes in this movie that may not be to everyone's taste, but they all serve a purpose. I found it a very engrossing film with a very understated and atmospheric score that fitted just nicely into the piece. Over all, an interesting and very enthralling drama, recommended.My score: 7.8/10",Eastern Promises
113,jpschapira,What it has to be,8,23 February 2008,"""Eastern Promises"" is not a character movie, not at all. It's a movie about events, but an events movie where characters matter a little more than, for example, ""The Bourne Identity"" and its sequels; David Cronenberg's piece is one where you can sense more details about a bigger number of characters because the plot line has a bit more of complexity.When a Russian teenager, bathed in blood, gives birth to a little girl in a hospital and dies, Anna (Naomi Watts in top-form), the doctor in charge, finds and keeps the girl's diary and decides to locate her family so the baby can have a place to grow up. However, she gets too involved with the diary, and ends up tangled with the Russian Mafia in London.It's a London that looks beautiful, during the day and the night; with the right choice of colors by cinematographer Peter Suschitzky. In one scene, there's a police investigation by the river, and a blue tent set up near the water causes an impression on the viewer; it's a light blue that strongly contrasts the dark blue of the calm water. But back to the storyThe chief of the mob, the boss, the Godfather, Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), offers Anna to translate the diary in question, and everything begins when she enters his restaurant and senses something's not right; something in Semyon's tone of voice and look. Mueller-Stahl's performance here is superb: one of those portrayals that commonly remain unnoticed because of the understood wisdom and superiority that kind of character comes with; it doesn't look like it's a big effort. In the restaurant Anna also meets Semyon's son, Kirill (an annoying an overacted Vincent Cassel) and the family's driver Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen, the opposite of Cassel), a black- suited, mysterious man who proclaims: ""I'm just a driver"". But we know there's something more. The roads the story takes; the changes and indecision of the characters; the how, why and when of every death; and the silent love story covered in Steve Knight's precise (meaning not one word that shouldn't be there and not a word to be added) script are almost ridiculed by how vaguely Howard Shore's score captures the movie's moods.Probably the most important scene of the film is the fight sequence in the showers where Viggo Mortensen basically kicks some ass and a lot of blood fills the screen (you have to watch it to believe it). A risky composer would have put at least something barely audible on the back, for the increase of emotion; but Shore settles for silence. Maybe I would have accepted silence from another composer in another film or a similar moment, but Shore opens ""Eastern Promises"" with something similar to what you listen in a horror movie; something disappointing that you expect to be better throughout the film. It doesn't make it worse, however (as Jonny Greenwood doesn't make ""There Will Be Blood"" worse and Nick Cave doesn't diminishes the regularity of ""The Assassination""). Of all the performances, I'd pick Mueller Stahl's, but I can't overlook Mortensen's composition. You may think he displays no powerful moments, as he repeats the same thing with the same irrelevance a lot of times; you may be expecting something like Daniel Day-Lewis' 'I've abandoned my child' scene or George Clooney's final scene in ""Michael Clayton"" or Depp's singing in ""Sweeney Todd"". Forget it; it wouldn't be as good as a performance and a betrayal to the essence of character, which is something Mortensen doesn't do, not even with Aragorn. The cold look, the lack of compassion, the stillness and tranquility (not even the control of the Russian accent) of a character that enjoys silence, a character we know nothing about at first sight; those are the things you should pay attention to so you realize the magnitude of Mortensen's work. ""Eastern Promises"" is a film that's so effective, so short, so expertly narrated (by its director and by the teenager character that carries out the task of another pleasant and non- traditional narration) and so quick that you may get the feeling there's a lot missing; that you want to see more. If you don't get that feeling, it means that you enjoyed the movie as what it essentially is; if you do, appreciate the chance of trying to figure out what would have come next. But really appreciate it, to the point that you end up enjoying it as much as the one who didn't put their minds at workLike me.",Eastern Promises

To be fair, Vincent's character is an unhinged nutcase and not someone to be liked, but it's just a role, one which he plays to the hilt.It was interesting to see Viggo Mortensen in such a subdued role, taking a backseat to his employer, Vincent Cassel. But there was a reason and it comes to the fore towards the end of the movie.As far as this flick was concerned, yeah, it's violent and not for the squeamish. But it was also an educational affair.

115,EijnarAmadeus,"Balls-Out, Blistering Mortensen",9,2 February 2008,"In A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE Viggo Mortensen portrayed a man hiding and declining his past, in his second Cronenberg outing he struts his violent history on his body, combining scars and tattoos. The way Cronenberg has strutted his violence throughout the years has disturbed and fascinated,a and he's always linked his violence with purpose - to different degrees off course, but here in EASTERN PROMISES the violence plays a prominent role in keeping the atmosphere bleak and dark; and oddly enough, one of the movie's most shocking scenes is actually the start of something beautiful - it features a young prostitute's uterus releasing blood all over the floor, the young girl births a baby but dies herself; and that baby becomes the movie's centerpiece of promise.The movie is set in London, but you won't see neither Big Ben, red buses or the Buckingham Palace here - it's underground London focusing strictly on the Russian mafia; a crime ring led by Semyon, the owner of a restaurant, he operates dirty business behind his charming, food-loving mask - he's a masked monster. Back at the baby- midwife Anna tries to link the baby to her Russian family by reading through her departed mum's diary-notes. This leads Anna to off course the Vory V Zakone syndicate, and in-hell-and-back-again driver/butcher Nikolai Luzhin.The main characters are both intriguing; Naomi Watts delivers another crafted performance as she struggles her way past her mum and racist-uncle to discover the true story of this tragic story. Watts turns out something extraordinary as she discovers just as much herself through the hellish mafia-ride as the story of the child&mother. And Mortensen off course, what a spectacular performance - he turns Nikolai into a machinery of muscle and eerie with a tied-down emotional core. He fills the screen with pure and brutal power; and note the balls-out fighting scene in the bathhouse - not just a party-killer, but so powerful and frightful as can be.

116,RonellSowes,Brutal And Fresh Take On Gangster Flicks,7,4 July 2021,"The majority of mob movies out there usually about Italians in New York or other commonly portrayed gangsters, and whatever they are they're very rarely about the Russian mafia in London.Eastern Promises offers you a look into a hardly, if ever, seen world before and constructs a story that closely aligns the point of view of its protagonist with that of the audience. The further the film progresses the deeper it intrenches itself into the criminal world and the characters that comprise it and the entire time its spearpointed by Viggo Mortensen. Mortensen isn't Russian but he does a very convincing job portraying one and he is equally convincing and imposing as a gangster and its yet another severely underrated performance from probably the most underrated actor of his generation.The film is different from most of its peers in more ways than just the nationality of its characters. There's no mistaking who the villains are and it doesn't fall vicictim to glorifying mobsters in the way so many others, including The Godfather do(I dont wish to compare the two but that is something that deserves to be pointed out). Eastern Promises is an unrelenting film in which brtuality is practically it's trademark and it includes many such moments; probably the most notable being an extremely visceral and bare fight sequence in a bath house. But just because it's so raw doesn't mean it doesnt have its refinements. For all of its unvarnished aspects the film also contains a carefully constructed plot and it pays attention to the smallest details in order to deliver with the proper style.",Eastern Promises

119,oneloveall,"A perfect continuation of Cronenberg's more accessible, though still challenging repertoire",7,14 September 2007,"David Cronenberg has come a long way from low budget science fiction, through explicitly combative material, and onward into a Hollywood assimilation. I feared that the re-teaming of him and Viggo Mortensen would reiterate the fact that this always-reliable director had settled into a sort of creative comfort zone, perhaps rightfully so. After all, his last film, A History of Violence, might not have been his strongest work but no one can debate it was the most seen of his late career work.So the maestro of disturbance has settled on challenging a larger crowd, and though it may pain me to see some clichéd indulgences hogging up the screen, Hollywood needs Cronenberg far more then the art-house crowds who have seen Naked Lunch multiple times. A Mafia movie is what we get, and subvert is what this man does. Taking the accessible framework that helped elevate his popularity in AHOV to new heights, this deceptively skimpy plot-line gets an extensive workout from our Director's unabashed obsession with showing the imagery that burns, coupled with Mortensen's surprisingly awesome performance.For once, one of Hollywood's stiffest leading men makes it work in his favor. This is a career-advancing role for Mr. Mortensen, showing an incredible dedication to character in all of his subtle mannerisms, hopefully which will haunt viewers even after the final frame. His Russian ""family"" rounds out an electrifying supporting cast which keeps Cronenberg's taut undertow full steam ahead- only late in the third act does anything become slightly less gripping.Eastern Promises is a superb adult drama that will entertain as much as shock your typical theater-goer (despite a heavy dose of..heavy, plenty of unexpected humor pops up). Light hearted viewers be warned: even though this director has always been known to exercise a classy restraint (unlike a majority of action shot in film) Cronenberg does always enjoy to put his most disturbing and uncomfortable moments in your face, amounting to several scenes (no sooner then 3 in the first five minutes) of brief graphic imagery, culminating in what is sure to go down as 2007's most visceral fight scene.",Eastern Promises
120,Superunknovvn,Cronenberg finally settled in his new direction,8,2 January 2008,"Ever since Cronenberg started making ""straight"" movies without (too many) splatter elements, something in his oeuvre had been lacking. ""Spider"" was beautifully photographed but a complete and utter bore. The much praised ""A History Of Violence"" had a great cast and a solid premise, but turned out to be just as boring and on top of that far-fetched and superficial. ""Eastern Promises"" finds Cronenberg finally coming to terms with his new ""realistic"" approach to movie making.It's a little wonder that there haven't been too many serious movies about the Russian Mafia, yet, so having a movie that takes place in these circles is fascinating all by itself. Cronenberg sets the story up slowly, but nicely. He never falls into the trap of slowing things down too much as he did with his previous two movies. Cronenberg also avoids getting too close to the style of the genre's Big Kahuna, Martin Scorsese. This is a completely original effort, which sets it apart from 2007's snorefest ""American Gangster"", that didn't contribute anything new to the gangster genre at all.The cast is, of course, very helpful. Viggo Mortensen and Vincent Cassell look threatening, cold-blooded and emotional all at the same time. You really forget the actors and start looking at them as the characters they embody. Armin Mueller-Stahl who plays the gangster boss wasn't quite as convincing. During the movie we hear all those cruel and crazy things he's done, but when we see him on screen we can't really imagine that he's capable of all that. The weakest link in the cast, however, is Naomi Watts, who plays the same way she always does and comes across as pretty one-dimensional. She has deservedly gotten a lot of praise for ""Mullholland Dr."" but failed to present a comparably great performance ever since. She's just good enough not to ruin the intensity of this movie.""Eastern Promises"" is aesthetic, explicit and thrilling. There are some scenes you won't forget for weeks to come (the sauna fight, the opening sequence). In short, what we have here is a modern classic. One of last year's finest and possibly the best movie David Cronenberg has made so far.",Eastern Promises
121,RJBurke1942,"Promises, promises  but who can you ever really trust?",8,2 April 2008,"Let me say this upfront: if you're squeamish about hard-core violence in a gangland setting, don't see this film. There are some extremely bloody scenes of throat cutting, a brief scene of body dismemberment and arguably the goriest hand-to-hand fight yet put to film. The violence, of course, is abhorrent but is portrayed in the context of the story; there is nothing gratuitous. Moreover, the technical aspects of those bloody scenes had me fascinated, wondering just how those particular effects were achieved.That aside, let me begin with the story intro and setting: a mid-wife at a London hospital becomes involved with the new-born daughter of a prostitute who dies in childbirth. The mid-wife, Anna (Naomi Watts), is half-Russian but barely speaks the language; the prostitute was also Russian and an illegal immigrant to the UK. Anna tracks down where she worked  a restaurant operated by a Russian Mafia boss (but Anna is unaware of that)  to find out how to get the newborn back to the dead woman's family in Russia. In doing so, she tells the Mafia boss, Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), of a diary in Russian that she wants translated so that she can perhaps find out where the dead mother came from.Well, as you can imagine, that was Anna's big mistake. For the rest of the plot, you'll have to see the movie, because from that point on, the story becomes beautifully complicated with the presence of Kirill (Vincent Cassel) as Semyon's errant, arrogant and erratic son who just can't be trusted to behave; and, more ominously, with the dark, brooding and very menacing presence of Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen) as the chauffeur from Hell, perhaps, and Mr Fixit Extraordinaire to boot. If you recall Jean Reno as the Cleaner in La Femme Nikita (1990), then you begin to have an idea of what I'm talking about: Mortensen gives cleaning a whole new dimension, being more fastidious than Reno's Cleaner and much, much tougher than Don Corleone's bodyguard/chauffeur, Luca, from The Godfather (1972).Compounding Anna's quest even further is her later attraction to Nikolai (despite her misgivings) and the unintended consequences of the execution of a Chechen gangster at the very start of the film  organized by Kirill, but without his father's knowledge. Semyon, when he finds out, is  to it mildly  much disturbed by his son's action and turns to Nikolai to set things right. The resulting bloodbath  a pun you will appreciate more if you see the movie  between Nikolai and Chechens when the latter turn up to avenge the execution is Cronenberg at his best, I think. He'd directed Mortensen in A History of Violence (2002) prior to this, so the two, from accounts I've read, work together well. So, I guess I'm a bit late in the day, so to speak, to recognize the quality of Mortensen's performance, which was indeed Academy Award material in this film and in others too, proving that he's an actor to watch, and admire, in future films.Mueller-Stahl, as always, is chillingly effective as the Russian don; Vincent Cassel, whom I recall with admiration in La Haine (1995), gives a fine performance as the near-psychopathic son; and, Naomi Watts fulfills the mothering role, with a spunky and realistic act that is a key feature of the narrative but still leaving her with marginally less screen time than the others. Supporting characters are uniformly good.The setting in London is superb: the rain soaked streets, the night shadows, the rundown slummy areas, the football crowds  all evoked memories of the time I lived there forty years ago. Some things change, but not London, I guess. The script and the accents used are great; Mortensen, I understand, spent a while in Russia prior to filming to pick up tips from the local scene. He's an accomplished linguist, anyway.There are two major critiques, however. First, that gory fight I mentioned has a big flaw: Mortensen is entirely naked for the whole time and we all know how easy it is to temporarily disable a man so much exposed; but the Chechen assassins didn't know that, apparently. However, Nikolai is, truly, one very tough and very fast hombre. And second, when Kirill has a change of heart late in the drama, it just didn't ring true for me. But... maybe I'm too much of a cynic?Despite those, the film ends with an interesting, and unexpected, premise that almost screams sequel. I hope not; if this wasn't a Cronenberg film I'd be alarmed. Can't be too sure, however...Overall though: for gritty, real life drama, this film ranks as one of the best I've seen for a many a year and made all the more entertaining by that unexpected twist near the end. I was a bit chuffed, however, with myself that I didn't see it coming. Damn...",Eastern Promises
122,DonFishies,Cronenberg and Mortensen deliver in one unmissably solid thriller,8,21 September 2007,"When I first saw the trailer for Eastern Promises, I was a little confused. Yes, A History of Violence was a complete turnaround style picture for David Cronenberg (whose previous films include the most twistedly eccentric visions of horrendously graphic violence and overtly over sexualized human beings and monsters), but I had not expected that he would continue down the path of the ""independent mainstream"". I was a little hesitant to see it at first, but gradually the trailer's imagery drew me in. And now I can say there really is a reason for the Oscar buzz.There really is no way to perfectly describe Eastern Promises without giving a few juicy details away. It revolves around a Russian crime circuit in London, headed by Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), and includes his son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) and Kirill's driver Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen). Anna (Naomi Watts), a midwife, gets involved within the circuit unknowingly when she attempts to get a diary, recently left by a teenage mother who died during childbirth, translated from Russian into English.The plot is really not that complicated, but giving a full description ruins the little idiosyncrasies and poignant character moments shared within the film. Oscar-nominee Steve Knight has constructed a gritty, atmospheric thriller that starts up quick and then slows down to a nice steady pace, just so the audience can catch its breath and brood over the workings of the cast. It is dialogue driven, but when it is not being sly or darkly comedic, it plays out like an opera. We gradually learn all the intimate details of every sketchy character, and we get a deeper sense of just how bad some of these characters are. It is not just a paint-by-numbers depiction of bad men, it is a highly detailed and clearly articulate character study. And even at its dullest moments, it works excellently.Kudos also goes to Cronenberg's go to cinematographer, Peter Suschitsky. London and its drab and depressing climate are beautifully represented here from the first frame, all the way up to the last. Even when the sun is out, the sets have a certain subdued haze over them. We are watching a film about the criminal underbelly, and its settings help reflected just how low these people are in their moral standings. It works greatly in favour of the film, and it almost works as a character in itself. The drab, almost noir, settings help achieve the dirty politics of the film, and they help explore the character studies even further. Whether it's the scariness of watching Mortensen in the dark, or just looking at the glare of Mueller-Stahl in his dimmed restaurant, all of the details have been amped up on each set to give the audience a greater sense of understanding and purpose, for just about every character.And what Cronenberg film would be without some bizarrely violent visuals? While not exactly a bloodbath, Cronenberg does have a few moments where he paints the screen a bright shade of scarlet red. And when it begins to flow, there is nothing that can really stop it. It works much in the same way as it did in Violence, in that the film builds to a scene loaded with it and just lets loose in a ferocious manner unlike any well-known director currently working in the mainstream on movies that are not specifically horror (with obvious exceptions to Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez). It has that Cronenbergian touch, and much like his other films, its style is impeccable and thought-provoking.Another fantastic element is the score by Howard Shore. It slows when it needs to, and it quickens even faster. It plays out wonderfully throughout the scenes, and gives them a sort of classy feel. I realize I used the opera description before, but it fits even better here. Its great workings underpin every scene, and help dictate just how well off the film is.What hurts the film (besides some very bizarre choices by Watts' character) is the denouement. It works, but I just cannot fathom how neither Knight nor Cronenberg thought it was appropriate for the story that was taking place. It just does not have the solid impact that every other scene either has, or builds to. I sat, almost dumbfounded, trying to figure out who thought it was a good idea, and why no one told them to re-write it. But I will say, much like Violence, Promises has an absolutely stunning final moment. But to get to that astounding moment, you have to sit through a rather disappointing finale.If you thought you had seen Mortensen's best work before Promises, then you will be in for a very big surprise. His cold and calculating performance as Nikolai is the stuff that creates legends. He is menacing from the word go, and even as the enigmatic slowly becomes the well-known, you will just stare in fear and awe as he speaks on screen. From the terrifying tattoos, to a small character moment where he puts out a cigarette on his tongue, Mortensen is the quintessential image of evil. His unrestrained anger is felt throughout the film, and hopefully, will be just the right performance to launch him into the stratosphere of Oscar-nominated actors. Even during the let-down of an ending, he keeps up, and never lets anyone down.The rest of the cast, albeit nowhere near as strong as Mortensen, are all very good supporting characters. Watts' character may have issues, but she breathes a certain life into the naïve character that I doubt many others could match. Much the same goes for Cassel and Mueller-Stahl, who bring just the right amount of intensity to their roles.Although it is flawed, Cronenberg has delivered yet another exceptional thriller. It will surely be recognized at Oscar time, and for good reason too. Do not miss it.8.5/10.",Eastern Promises
123,moviesleuth2,Static,5,18 May 2009,"In light of the success of Martin Scorcese's ""The Departed,"" gangster movies have become popular again. The new trend has a number of traits: a dark, gritty, feel and copious amounts of brutal and bloody violence. David Cronenberg's new film has both (though not as much of the latter as one might expect). But there is a major difference between Scorcese's film and this one: ""The Departed"" may have been flawed, but it was always engaging. ""Eastern Promises"" is anything but.Anna (Naiomi Watts) is a midwife at a London hospital. A young girl gives birth in her ward but dies soon after. Anna finds a diary in the girls purse, and she goes to the address on the business card that she finds in the diary. Unfortunately for her, that leads her into contact with a vicious Russian mob family, headed by Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl).""Eastern Promises"" starts out with promise (no pun intended). It's mysterious, with little bits of information given out slowly. Unfortunately, the plot loses its steam about 30 minutes into the proceedings, if that. It's as if screenwriter Steven Knight suddenly came down with writer's block and simply didn't know where to go with the story, so he wrote whatever he could think of. Up until the final 15 minutes, there's really no plot to speak of. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but the characters are bland and uninteresting, which has to make up for the deficiencies of the plot in that case.The performances are all around disappointing. Naiomi Watts can hardly be blamed for this, however. Watts gives it her all, but the screenplay makes her character do some really stupid things for the sake of moving the plot (such as it is) along. Viggo Mortenson received an Oscar nomination for his performance, and while he has a credible Russian accent and speaks the language without any glaring flaws, that's about all that can be said about his work here.Few people can be relied on to create vicious villains like Vincent Cassel and Armin Mueller-Stahl. Unfortnately, neither one of them does so. Both of them try their best, but neither one of them raise a single hair or get the blood flowing. I was expecting that if any of the actors were going to creep me out, it was going to be one or both of them. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.David Cronenberg was by and large a cult sci-fi director who made movies that were more than slightly off-kilter. Then he came into the mainstream with ""A History of Violence."" I don't know how that movie became so popular; if there was a movie that was overrated, that was it. The problem I had with the former film was that it resolved everything long before the movie was over, thus adding an extra thirty minutes when it really didn't need to. A similar problem plagues ""Eastern Promises."" It starts out good, but it can't hold on to the viewer's interest. Unfortunately, the time ratio is reversed. Whereas the first hour of ""A History of Violence"" was engaging, and the final half hour was not, only the first thirty minutes of ""Eastern Promises"" were good, and the rest was boring.David Cronenberg may be trying to go more mainstream nowadays (with this movie, he is clearly influenced by Scorcese). I don't have a problem with that. Cronenberg is a talented director. But let's just hope that in the future, he'll choose to direct films that have potential.",Eastern Promises
124,Maniac-9,Great movie about the Russian mafia,9,9 March 2012,"We've had plenty of movies about the Italian mafia but it's nice to see how a Russian mob operates for a change. The story is set in London but involves mostly all characters originally from Russia. Viggo Mortensen has a flawless accent and overall persona down pat of a Russian gangster that you literally forget that he's really an American and actually believe he's the character he's portraying. Naomi Watts plays the female lead who's a midwife at a hospital after a young pregnant girl comes to the hospital and dies in child birth. And she finds out that the girl was a prostitute involved with the Russians, which puts her in their cross hairs.Everything about this movie is authentic about people in that life down to their tattoos.",Eastern Promises
125,rajdoctor,Eastern Promises,8,15 December 2007,"I had heard a lot of praise about the History of Violence, but never got to see it. So when I knew that this movie was directed by the same director  I made it a point to visit the theatres the next day of the movie's release. I had earlier seen the movie's trailer and found it dark. I also had read the good review, but had found the story a bit strange and was thinking, how the director would have told the story  would it be really interesting? The story is about a nurse Anna (Naomi Watts) who adopts a orphan baby from a dying Russian girl  whose dairy leads her to the Semyon (Armin Mueller Stahl) a restaurant owner and underworld Russian mafia lord, his son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) and the loyal driver Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen). Anna slowly realizes the dark secrets of the death of the Russian girl. The only person who can rescue her, the baby and her family is Nikolai - the driver.The movie is co-produced by BBC, and it is a gutsy decision to be partner of a violent movie. (BBC is not famous of doing such things). The movie is dark. It is violent. Director David Cronenberg loves to show blood, and gruesome dis-figuring of human body very graphically  which makes us cringe on our seat.The story is written by TV writer Steven Knight and he has done a great job in maintaining a tight script and screenplay. He brings about new angles to the gangster and mafia drama. The human elements of the movie, especially the emotional bonding between different characters are brought out evidently.Technically the movie is raw, but master stroked of David are evident when he start showing the darker sides. Viggo Mortensen, has acted with subtle loyalty to his character and role. He is a mean killer, a loyal friend, a silent lover, and an ambitious gang member. Armin Mueller steals the show with his age and experience and the brutality of his personality  without getting involved in a single violent scene  still he sends chills to your spine with his darker personality evolving.Unforgettable is the fight scene of Viggo in the sauna center. It is something not seen before and would / should definitely be recommended as one the best fight sequences captured in the history of movie making.A great commercial viable violent movie. Great to watch such good movie making! (Stars 7.75 out of 10)",Eastern Promises
126,WriterDave,Haunting Low Wattage Glows in Dank London Night,8,24 September 2007,"An emotionally distraught London midwife (Naomi Watts) finds a mysterious diary on the body of a Russian teenage girl who died in childbirth and slowly sinks deeper into the grimy underbelly of London and uncovers a Russian mob where a lowly driver (Viggo Mortensen) is about to make a stunning play for power. Luckily for the audience, ""Eastern Promises"" is more in tune with screenwriter Steven Knight's most recent film (the superb ""Dirty Pretty Things"") than it is with director David Cronenberg's previous endeavor (the criminally overrated ""A History of Violence"").Cronenberg has been honing a disturbingly minimalist directorial style in the later half of his career. It was so low-key the last time around, he actually managed to become the first person to un-direct a film with ""A History of Violence."" My theory of un-direction stems from when a director films a piece of work in so minimalist a style, it actually negates any reason for the film to exist. Shockingly, this minimalist technique is put to some good use in ""Eastern Promises"" as it allows for the emergence of other far superior elements: the elegantly dark and gritty blue-gray cinematography of Peter Suschitzky, the evocative Russian-influenced score from Oscar-winning composer Howard Shore, the crafty and tightly focused screenplay from Knight, and most importantly, the amazing performances from the entire cast.In the lead role of Nikolai, Viggo Mortensen, in tattoos from head to toe, adds new meaning to the idea of an actor throwing himself completely into a ""physical role."" He delivers a raw, tense performance that is arguably the greatest of his career.As Anna, Naomi Watts serves as the heart and soul of the film, giving the audience someone to relate to and root for as the plot grows increasingly dark and grim. Watts has been unfairly dismissed by some as an overly emotive post-modern ""scream-queen"" due to her roles in films like ""Mulholland Drive,"" ""The Ring,"" and ""King Kong."" As she has matured as an actress, Watts has grown more subtle and nuanced in her method, and her performance here is richly textured and deeply rewarding as it emerges on the heels of her revelatory work in ""The Painted Veil."" She's the dim glow of hope in this stinking London underworld, and her character haunts the scenes of grotesque violence and criminal power plays that occur when she is off screen.""Eastern Promises"" also deserves credit for the tension it builds as the story unfolds. Cronenberg succumbs to his sadistic natural tendencies at clearly defined intervals throughout the film where shocking spurts of gore and violence rip through the minimalist style like a knife through the heart. This rising and sinking tension culminates in a Turkish sauna knife fight that is the violently dramatic flip-side of the comedic nude wrestling hotel scene in last year's ""Borat."" Like that scene, it exists only to shock, and it will have people buzzing.Despite the inherent flaws of Cronenberg's style which always seems to leave a bad taste in your mouth, ""Eastern Promises"" has just the right amount of star-power, classy production values, and shocking plot twists to be considered one of the best thrillers of 2007.",Eastern Promises
127,LazySod,Very interesting,8,13 December 2007,"A woman working on the maternity ward of a hospital finds herself in a difficult position when a chain of events leads her to investigate a Russian family living in her town. As her days go by the web becomes more and more tangled and trouble goes from bad to downright evil.Starting as a slow thriller this film has quite a nice build-up. It doesn't have a lot of action sequences but the one it does have are done very well and the line of events is entirely believable. The story is so tangled that there seems to be a secret behind every other door but it never gets to the point where it becomes non-understandable. Musical score fits with the scenery - dark and dreary and with the constant presence of anxiety builders it feels very good.When the film ended I felt myself sitting in the cinema with a bit of a lump in my throat. It took a while before I could leave the cinema and I was surprised to have a thriller leave that kind of impact - most of them are forgotten the moment the cinema is left behind for the day. So, all in all, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed this one. It's not very fast, but it is compelling and holds a tension field up from the start to the end.8 out of 10 dark days",Eastern Promises
128,judywalker2,Another film by Cronenberg that could have been better,7,24 September 2007,"I never saw any Cronenberg film until he made A History of Violence. I tried to watch Crash but I couldn't. I like Jeremy Irons but never say Dead Ringers. In fact I only saw A History of Violence because I liked the actors involved, especially Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello and Ed Harris. I went to see Eastern Promises for the same reason I saw A History of Violence, I liked the actors. For similar reasons as the other Cronenberg film I thought that the characters were interesting but as the violence in the previous film was necessary to the story (it was based on a graphic novel) I thought that this violence was more cartoonish and very poorly done. In fact the only necessary violent scene was the one that getting all of the press. It had the making of a very interesting story of Nikolai and Kirill. This movie really felt incomplete (unlike History of Violence that left you pretty much knowing what would happen) and empty. You want to continue the story; you leave saying 'is that it?'. Maybe that's why Cronenberg keeps doing endings like this, but someone should tell him that as a filmaking, yes the films are for you but they are also for the audience and endings like that leave us very unsatisfied. 7/10",Eastern Promises
129,ClaytonDavis,"Promise Kept, Promise Kept Indeed",7,15 September 2007,"Eastern Promises, the highly anticipated film by A History of Violence director David Cronenberg is an exceedingly riveting motion picture. It is jam-packed with elevated levels of suspense, top notch performances and a storyline to die for.The film tells the story of Nikolai and Anna; two people who's paths cross and unravels a very powerful mystery at hand. When Anna (played exquisitely by Naomi Watts) finds a young infant it leads her to London's most powerful families which could ultimately destroy her and her family. In the middle of the dilemma is Nikolai, (in Viggo Mortensen's best performance to date) whose presence brings shutter to the viewer.While Mortensen and Watts turn in flawless performances Oscar may have problems with both. With Mortensen, we run into the same problem we did with A History of Violence, a seamless execution of artistry but too reserved for Oscar's forte. Naomi Watts may fall into the Maria Bello problem of category confusion. This critic is unsure of where to place her, but she may fair better in supporting but alas, the performance itself doesn't measure to her 21 Grams work.The revelation of the picture comes from the Oscar nominated Armin Mueller-Stahl who brings fear and torment to the audience as ""Semyon,"" the head of the London crime family. His ""Semyon"" (who is reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's snubbed work in The Departed) brings sheer brilliance to his role and may be an unseen frontrunner in the upcoming Oscar race. As Alan Arkin captured his Oscar last year for veteran status, Stahl may do the same.Vincent Cassel also turns in an accomplished performance but with his character having such an unlikable factor and no true ""Oscar scene"" to stand on, Cassel may be overshadowed greatly by Stahl. Cassel plays ""Kirill,"" the son of Semyon and heir to the throne of the crime family. His spoiled ""Kirill"" is as obnoxious as he is compassionate and cowardly as he is sensitive. Cassel is an actor to watch in the near future.But with uncharted work coming from the actors and a smooth elegant script by Oscar nominated Steven Knight, the praise and commendation merits to the overdue director, David Cronenberg. This is a very Cronenberg-like film with huge amounts of violence and much talked about naked Viggo fight sequence but with the capture of the tone, aggression and subject matter of the motion picture, Cronenberg excels once again in a genre he's all too familiar with. He'll probably be a personal favorite this year for a nomination but Oscar tends to not favor this type of work.Eastern Promises, is a crime thriller of the ages but doesn't rank with previous works like The Departed and Goodfellas but should categorized on its own. An outstanding work with excellent cinematography and an even potent score; this film is quite enjoyable and keeps its promises indeed.****/****",Eastern Promises
130,socrates99,Nearly flawless film-making is awe-inspiring with people in top form,9,8 January 2008,"There's probably no bigger source of unanswered questions than the Russian Mafia. What kind of people are they? Are they as ruthless as they say? This film is not intended as a guide or introduction. It's an entertainment using a somewhat unfamiliar subject and terrain, the back streets of London where the Russian mob is carving out a respectable living. And yet this simple story could easily spawn a whole new gangster genre. Viggo Mortensen is letter perfect. Once again a truly superior actor makes you wonder, who else could possibly have carried this role off? Add the drunken son played by Vincent Cassel, and the ominous father figure played by Armin Mueller-Stahl, and you have an intriguing troika of menace mixed with violence and cunning. In execution and conception, this is probably the most perfect film I've seen in a long time. Its flaws are quibbles, really. I only wish I could produce something as 'flawed' as this little unforgettable masterpiece. (As an aside, you might want to check out ""The Painted Veil"" and contrast Naomi Watt's two performances. Her performance here suffers a bit in comparison, but only because her role in ""The Painted Veil"" was so much more substantial."")",Eastern Promises
131,gsygsy,don't miss it,8,29 October 2007,"Another excellent film from Mr Cronenberg. It isn't in the same league as A History of Violence: this story is more local, less epic. It packs a powerful punch all the same.Cronenberg seems so interested in skin - in its colours and textures, both living and dead. There's certainly a fair amount of it on display here and, as in any movie by this director, the squeamish might think twice about attending. It's such a good piece of work, though, it would be a pity to miss it just because you feel faint at the sight of blood, albeit fake blood.Superb photography, skillful editing, moody music, and terrific performances from the international cast, led by Viggo Mortensen, who is stunning.

132,dead47548,One of the best of the year. Mortensen is a revelation.,9,8 January 2008,"It shares a lot of similarities with A History of Violence in the sense that they both focus around a central character and lives rooted in pure violence. In History everything was more subtle and hidden beneath the surface, and when violence finally erupted it was strong, loud and (save a smashed coffee pot and a shattered nose) at the result of mechanical weapons. Eastern Promises takes on a much more brutal approach to it's violence. Everything is done with knives or bare hands and this gives it all a much grittier, realistic feel. ""Realistic"" of course is a phrase to use lightly in terms of the film since it does take some unbelievable turns here and there and some of the performances come off as really artificial...though this may be a result of some pretty forced dialogue. Still, Cronenberg creates a wrenchingly unnerving ambiance to the entire picture and, with the assistance of a sensational score, an experience that completely immerses me and keeps me on the edge of my seat the entire time.Cronenberg has always taken a ""no bullshit"" approach to showing violence and that approach is at it's most prominent here, which in my case really brings the viewer into the world that these characters live in and creates a painful state of suspense and fear for those involved. Of course it's impossible to talk about the film without mentioning Viggo Mortensen's startling performances which is very high among the best I've ever seen. His subtle intensity and raw brutality strikes immense fear with a single glare. The fact that he has no reaction to the violence that he sees and imposes on those around him puts that sense of fear even deeper into my blood.The big twist is one that truly stunned me into silence when I first saw the film and adds so much complexity to his character that my sense of fear and respect for him grows into an even deeper respect...but more so towards immense sympathy. Naomi Watts delivers a good performance, but she's really just a plot device to bring us into Nikolai's world and give the plot an actual running story that can have a beginning and end. The final shot of Nikolai sitting quietly in his booth, flipping the bracelet in and out of his hands is extremely powerful and left me holding my breath. So much pain and dedication, in one instance. The more I think/talk about it, the more I do love it but it's something that gives an enormous impact when I'm watching it and that impact slowly wears off afterwards. But I do love it immensely. There's no doubt in my mind about that.And I didn't even talk about the bath house.",Eastern Promises

The story is rather subtle and implied but its overall impact is undeniable. It's certainly not the typical Hollywood structured narrative. I found Cronenberg's direction to be pretty low-key here, but it allowed the story to take focus without showing off with some fancy camera tricks. Mortenson is quite terrific here, driving the story with his magnetic performance while remaining simultaneously dangerous and mysterious. All of the characters are given satisfactory amounts of depth, and the actors make them all feel genuine. The violence is graphic and shocking, but only because the rest of the film is so quiet and unassuming. The contrast between the action-filled and the actionless bits is what makes the brutality all the more shocking. It's not perfect, though; I would have liked a stronger plot, though, and there are some moments that reek of cliché, but, overall, the film is masterful.",Eastern Promises

In ""Eastern Promises"", Naomi Watts, dolled up in denim and leather, looks so hot on her rugged Ural motorbike that I wouldn't mind a full two hours of her speeding along the shady streets of London. Cronenberg might want to team up with Tarantino and give her a gun or a sword, working title: ""Uneasy Rider"". I almost feel sorry for Naomi Watts that she doesn't get to look at her own bonny backside. She should definitely see this movie, as should everybody else. ""Eastern Promises"" packs so much wit and drama it feels wasted on a single movie. The hideous steam room fight scene alone will make it worth your while. As usual, Viggo Mortensen commands the screen with his unassuming, yet sombre presence.

137,nobbytatoes,"Cronenberg going further into mainstream, not his best work",7,30 October 2007,"Cutting into the mainstream cinema, with his last film A History of Violence, Cronenberg keeps slicing his way further in; with lots of blood too. Always a cult director, Cronenberg seems to be diverting from his core themes; sex and flesh. History of Violence kept his themes in tact, Eastern Promises find Cronenberg on a different agenda. Far from trying to be the new Godfather, Eastern Promises seems prepped for this modern title. Focusing mainly on Nikolai, a driver and bodyguard of Semyon's son Kirill. Nikolai has aspiration to rise from chauffeuring Kirill and move to higher ranks in the Vory V Zakone. Throwing a spanner into the works is Anna, who starts to investigate to the parentage of a baby, after her mother died during birth. Reading the mother's diary, Anna find there is something more sinister to her death, which compromises Semyon.While seeing Cronenberg in a different light, if anything he hasn't left behind is his brutality of violence. Minimal are scenes of violence, as intense neck slicing and a fight in a bath house, drag up the nasty side of Nikolai's life and the business at hand. A smack of cheek can be felt as Nikolai defrosts a body with a hairdryer and laughs on the dead mans haircut. Eastern Promises constantly boils away with a sinister underbelly, but never completely reaches the surface. Cronenberg gave History of Violence a sharp edge from its pulp roots, Eastern Promises seems to have a pulp exterior to Steven Knight's dark screenplay.To point out a miscalculation, Knight's problem is Anna. Her character is misjudged and un-necessary. Her means of being here and compulsion to find what happened to the young mother feels contrived. Naomi Watts tries to bring an intrigue to Anna, yet looks rigid most of the time, for a woman possessed to find answers. Swinging the camera to Nikolai and Kirill, all slack is counter acted. Majorly to Viggo Mortensen's and Vincent Cassel's performance, Mortensen especially creates such a powerful and enigmatic character in Nikolai. Hitting another snag, Eastern Promises has to ambiguous of an ending, leaving many story arcs untied. Open for another film? Eastern Promises falls short of the visceral cinema experience Cronenberg wants, yet with Mortensen in his greatest role to date, Eastern Promises is a film of a director evolving into new territory.",Eastern Promises
138,gary-444,A 21st Century Gangster Classic,9,18 June 2009,"Director David Cronenberg has laid down a bloody marker for 21st Century Crime Thrillers with this visceral atmospheric work which ranks amongst his finest. Set in London, but played out almost exclusively amongst the Russian Underworld, ""Eastern Promises"" takes several brave risks, but wins them all.Although set in the Capital, boldly most of the recognisable landmarks are absent save for a long shot of Tower Bridge. This , when combined with the frequent use of Russian, creates an insular, claustrophobic feel, the trademark of close knit ex patriot communities. The actors are mainly Europea,n adding to the sense of an alien culture playing out on familiar turf.Cronenberg's prowess in offering sudden antiseptic, clinical violence is viciously on show here, none more so than in a savage confrontation in a bath house which is as horrific in its realism as I have ever seen displayed on the screen. There is an amorality about the violence which is depicted which is as disturbing as the violence itself.Viggo Mortensen excels as enigmatic driver Nikolai, Armin Mueller-Stahl offers a wonderful Godfather role as Semyon, oozing charm and cruel malevolence in equal measure whilst Naomi Watts, as Midwife Amy, provides far more than a bit of glamour as she pulls the bloody strands of people smuggling together. The beautiful rich cinematography belies the raw grittiness of its subject matter in a tightly scripted and fast paced ninety minutes. My only criticism is a strangely twee final few frames when a bleaker ending might have been more in keeping with what had gone before. Nonetheless the film is an absolute tour de force.",Eastern Promises
139,bobbobwhite,"Good film but please, no comparison to the The Godfather",8,21 October 2007,"This was a small film and meant to be just that. It was sinister, subdued, in the shadows, hiding from the light of public notice, just like the Russian mafia depicted in the story. This film was in no way similar or to be compared with the epic blockbuster The Godfather, like some here have done. This was a terrific film in its own right, and was original in its depiction of the Russian mafia operation in the USA today.Viggo Mortenson as an underling mafia hood on the rise, whose job was mostly babysitting his boss's mentally ill, weakling son, was the best thing in it, as he owned his role and will be forever linked to it, like Al Pacino in Scarface. Armin Mueller-Stahl ran a close second as the heavily cloaked head of the Russian Mafia in NYC who had a depraved past that he was going to keep concealed at any cost. Naomi Watts quietly played a mostly undemanding role, but it was necessary for story development. This was actually a man's movie through and through, but her role as a pediatric nurse was necessary to support an important part of the story involving an illegitimate baby of a 14 year old girl, and the baby's unknown and mysterious father. Viggo as Nicolai was as sensationally threatening as a subdued mafia cold-blooded killer could be, and was positively chilling with his facial expressions of hatred and disgust with the demeaning words and actions of those who disrespected him. You just knew big trouble would follow. Mueller-Stahl was marvelous as always and so chilling as Semyon, the big mafia boss who ran a fancy restaurant as a cover, who had a quiet and convincing and almost avuncular demeanor that only served to preface and counterpoint the incredibly cold-blooded violence he demanded from subordinates in order to solve any problem he perceived as a threat to his operation. He reminds me a lot of Max Von Sydow in his European-trained excellence in any role, and is always a dominating presence that commands your attention.What calculated treachery that happened between Nicolai and Semyon cannot be told here as it would ruin the story for viewers, but it is integral toward understanding the lack of loyalty and reward in this endemically treacherous system that rewards only the most violent, conclusive and brutal solution to any behavior determined, often illogically, to be a threat. Nobody or nothing matters more than that.The very impressive film had a commonly used story twist at the end that also cannot be divulged, but it led the story down a different path that softened the harder ending it might have had that would probably have been more realistic of what happens in that cruel world. However, it did serve to give viewers some hope that evil and psychopathy aren't in everyone out there.",Eastern Promises

141,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Damn good,7,20 June 2008,"David Cronenberg's signature obsessions flower in Eastern Promises, a stunning look at violence, responsibility, and skin. Near Christmastime in London, a baby is born to a teenage junkie--an event that leads a midwife (Naomi Watts) into the world of the Russian mob. Central to this world is an ambitious enforcer (Viggo Mortensen) who's lately budded up with the reckless son (Vincent Cassel) of a mob boss (Armin Mueller-Stahl, doing his benign-sinister thing). Screenwriter Steve Knight also wrote Dirty Pretty Things, and in some ways this is a companion piece to that film, though utterly different in style. The plot is classical to the point of being familiar, but Cronenberg doesn't allow anything to become sentimental; he and his peerless cinematographer Peter Suschitzky take a cool, controlled approach to this story. Because of that, when the movie erupts in its (relatively brief) violence, it's genuinely shocking. Cronenberg really puts the viewer through it, as though to shame the easy purveyors of pulp violence--nobody will cheer when the blood runs in this film. Still, Eastern Promises has a furtive humor, nicely conveyed in Viggo Mortensen's highly original performance. Covered in tattoos, his body a scroll depicting his personal history of violence, Mortensen conveys a subtle blend of resolve and lost-Nessa. He's a true, haunting mystery man.",Eastern Promises
142,come2whereimfrom,Gritty but let down by ending.,7,1 November 2007,"This latest offering from David Cronenberg teams him up once again with Viggo Mortensen after 'A History of Violence' and see Viggo play Nikolai a Russian gangster on the streets of London. His performance is much like Harris's was in 'History' with a air of menace to him at all times, he puts cigarettes out on his tongue and doesn't flinch at sorting out a corpse so it cant be identified. Like any of his films there are some very visceral scenes but nothing we haven't seen before but none the less a few might find the opening scene and the bath house fight a little squeamish. Elsewhere in the film Naomi Watts plays Anna the nurse who after delivering a child from a Russian girl who dies in labour finds her diary and desperate to trace any family has it translated but what she finds leads her deeper into the world of the mobsters and poses more questions than answers. With a fairly good script and solid direction the films pace is one that keeps you guessing as to where it's going to go and has a twist that is hard to see coming. The only thing in my opinion that lets the film down is the weak ending where it seems that everything is wrapped up in less than a minute or two.

Being one of the leading lights of independent filmmaking in the 1980s, together with other talents such as David Lynch (Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man), Cronenberg has always been progressive with his output. However, his latest effort, Eastern Promises, badly fails to strike a chord with viewers.Eastern Promises is a horribly weak answer to the year's other notable gangster picture – Ridley Scott's superlative American Gangster. One wonders what Cronenberg had in mind when he was making the picture. Eastern Promises makes a mess out of almost everything except Viggo Mortensen's daring display of wits and courage. Firstly, the good stuff. Mortensen's portrayal as a chauffeur for a secret black organization which rapes and tortures young women, along with doing drugs and smuggling booze, is the star highlight of the film. The rest of the cast performs well enough, but lacks solid characterization by Cronenberg who also wrote the screenplay.Apart from the mostly poorly-written characters, the story itself is stagnant. There's little drive and penetration in the narrative, resulting in an insipid two hours that spiral along cliché themes and forgettable plot twists. There's a surprising lack of suspense for most parts, and by Cronenberg's standards, the gore is tame in comparison to his earlier works. There's a brilliant Cronenbergian sequence though - a completely naked and unarmed Mortensen fending off two thugs with knives in a spa-house. Eastern Promises doesn't deliver like most gangster films do, in fact it's almost unforgivable. Pray for Cronenberg, will you?

144,benoit-3,"Another piece of morally degenerate canine excrement from the purveyors of ""A History of Violence""",1,17 September 2007,"Cronenberg is a media darling who can do no wrong in the eyes of the critics. Even the critics who don't like this film only dislike it because it is not up to the ""usual high standards"" set by its director. To condemn him absolutely is to loose one's ""cool"" status in the eyes of one's peers. Cronenberg's primary interest is to make morally and physically repellent films that propagate his credo of moral degeneracy and ugliness to an audience of gore connoisseurs. His recent evolution from primary schlockmeister to purveyor of a more ""psychological"" brand of filth - which has been called ""his going mainstream"" - has film critics and other closet gorehounds utterly entranced and delirious. See them swoon, see them falter, see them faint, see them wet themselves... This is the director, after all, who deconstructed Viggo Mortensen's ""Lord of the Rings"" persona as a knight in shining armour by turning him into yet another gun-happy, wooden-faced hit man in ""A History of Violence"" - a very profound piece of film-making based on ... a comicbook. His latest effort reprises this conceit. Mortensen still has the acting range of a wooden plank but, this time, his director uses an actual script written by an actual writer (he wrote episodes of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"") about a Russian crime family in London in order to sustain interest. But the result is basically the same, i.e. to see how many crapulent acts of violence one can fit in a theatrical feature without the patrons actually vomiting in the aisles. This film has everything to please an (American) audience avid for sadistic thrills that leave nothing to the imagination and to captivate a generation raised on violent video games: mob executions, moral turpitude, medical emergencies, creative violence aplenty, kinky sex, unpunished injustice and evil-doing, stereotypical noir atmosphere, caricatures and clichés passing as acting and plot points, you name it, it's all here. For the ladies and the gay part of the audience, Cronenberg has been generous enough to feature that darling Viggo's penis for a good ten minutes, which should make up for the absence of the muff-diving /sixty-nining/ wife-raping scenes of the first opus. The only thing funnier than the actual dialogue of this film - if you can rise above the blood vapours long enough to enjoy it - is the adjectives the critics use to glorify this idiot-savant of a director who is laughing all the way to the bank. Even though this film defames Russian emigrants as much as the latest 35-year cycle of American Mafioso films defames Italian-Americans, no Russian nationals were actually harmed during the shooting of this film. They are all played by non-Russians with varying degrees of embarrassment. Vincent (""Irréversible"") Cassel's main qualification for his role, for instance, is that he has been playing the same character for very nearly a dozen films as well as in real life. Decadent filth for a jaded, desensitized, morally bankrupt society? Da! Repulsive? Duh!",Eastern Promises

147,jonathanruano,Eastern Promises,9,28 February 2009,"Director David Cronenberg usually goes overboard with his films, but in the case of ""Eastern Promises,"" he gets it just about right. ""Eastern Promises"" is a film about prostitution, but it is much more than that. It takes you on a journey into the uncompromising underworld of the Russian mafia -- in this case, the Vore Sikonye family. There are fascinating and disturbing sites along the way. A mobster cutting off the fingers of a murdered mobster so that positive identification, as least through finger prints, becomes impossible. Assassinations and attempted assassinations abound. A scene in a brothel. A prostitute whose diary gives us an insight into the world of prostitution. On this journey, we (the audience) discover people who do despicable things, but somehow we come to understand them as human beings. We understand their uncompromising view of life and their toughness as they cope with one difficult situation after another. These are men who had it hard from the moment they are born and their experiences are reflected in their ability to survive, in the cut-throat ruthlessness and seeming disregard for human life. We also see how successfully they compartmentalize their lives.Kirill (Vincent Cassel), for example, is a beast and a drunk who orders his subordinates to cut throats, but he can also be very kind to children as evidenced in episodes where he is with his family. In other words, these characters are not straight-forward villains; they have nuances, with their lighter moments balancing their darker ones.This is not a perfect movie. I got so involved in the story that I was disappointed with the end, which struck me as a simplistic cop out. After staying with these characters for so long, I wanted a conclusion that fit with the rest of the film. I never got one. But until the last 15-20 minutes, the film was awfully good. Armin Mueller Stahl gives a wonderful performance as Semyon. Vincent Cassel is great as Kirill and Naomi Watts gives a capable performance as Anna. But by far the best performance was Viggo Mortenson's Nikolai. The secret of great acting is to convince the viewer that s/he is not seeing the actor on screen, but rather his character; and that the character is as real as you or I. Mortenson achieves that brilliantly. We forget we are seeing Mortenson from ""Lord of the Rings"" and we assume that we are watching a real Russian mobster on screen. In my humble opinion, Viggo Mortenson is the actor to watch, because he perfectly capable of giving the kind of performance that deserves an Academy Award. It would not surprise me if one day Mortenson wins one.",Eastern Promises
148,galileo3,"Cronenberg's cold blooded, brutal and tightly delivered mob hit",8,26 February 2008,"Eastern Promises (2007) David Cronenberg, a very successful director who doesn't hesitate to attack unusual subjects and environments, returns back on top form after his notable achievement in A History of Violence, in a story about the Russian mob in London.Plot: Anna Khitrova (Naomi Watts), a midwife at a London hospital, finds a Russian-language diary on the body of Tatiana, a fourteen-year-old girl who dies in childbirth. She also finds a card for the Trans-Siberian restaurant, which is owned by Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), a boss in the Russian Mafia or vory v zakone (""thieves in law""). Anna sets out to track down the girl's family so that she can find a home for the dead mother's baby girl. Anna's mother Helen (Sinéad Cusack) does not discourage her, but Anna's Russian-born uncle Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski), whom Anna asks for help with translation of the diary, urges caution. Through Semyon and her uncle, Anna comes to learn that Semyon and his bumbling and unstable son, Kirill (Vincent Cassel), had abused Tatiana and forced her into prostitution, and that Semyon had raped the girl.Kirill's driver is the Russian-born Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen), who also serves as the family's ""cleaner"", dumping dead bodies in the River Thames. Nikolai's star rises within the vory, due in part to Nikolai's protection of Kirill, who has authorised a hit on a rival Chechen vory leader. The hit was not approved by Semyon and was ill-advised, with the Chechen's brothers coming to London to seek vengeance. Semyon, afraid for his son's safety, hatches a plan. Semyon arranges to give ""Kirill"" up to the Chechens, which involves making Nikolai a full member of the vory, so he gets the same distinctive tattoos. A meeting is arranged at the Russian baths, and the Chechens are told that the tattooed Nikolai is actually Kirill. The Chechens attack Nikolai, but Nikolai is able to kill them both, ending up in the hospital with serious wounds.It is revealed near the end of the film that Nikolai is actually a member of the Russian Security Services (FSB) and a Scotland Yard informer on the Russian mafia. As part of his undercover duties, Nikolai was able to read Anna's diary before Semyon destroyed it, and he has a plan to bring Semyon down for Tatiana's rape, making Kirill the most powerful member of the London branch of the mob, but with Nikolai as the one who is really in charge. The plan works, with Anna gaining custody of the baby and Nikolai becoming the crime boss.The director's choice of Viggo Mortensen as Nikolai the driver was perhaps perfect after seeing this film. Mortensen captures the mannerisms and control of his emotions as an undercover man infiltrating organised crime. His performance is astonishing, enigmatic and definitely one of the very best you will see this year.The scene in the baths where a naked Nikolai fights two well built Chechens is destined to become a classic moment in cinema. The raw energy and obscene brutality of that scene makes it unforgettable.I enjoyed Eastern Promises and arguably it was perfectly made, however I do not think it possessed that extra element, that definitive inside to make it a 'perfect' film and for that it gets a solid and well deserved 8, but still I have to mention that it was superb.8/10",Eastern Promises

150,asifahsankhan,Brilliant! ... for the most part.,9,27 July 2015,"A lot Promising Viggo Mortensen, alongside with the smoothly menacing Mueller-Stahl, is the star of this film. But Mortensen, his killer looks, his shades, that one crooked smile, the thick accent and designer clothes, of which 'the British Telegraph'notices that the 'shirt's collar is so high that his throat is barely visible, he straddles the line between cartoon-inhuman villains like Max Headroom and Robocop', steals the show.As one might expect, Eastern Promises has its fair amount of ultra violence, which Cronenberg seems to enjoy adding even when his films appeal most to adult audiences. Such as the opening: A brutal barbershop scene - The movie itself is well done, with a relatively well-paced story, some interesting developments and strong characters.A Mafia Boss, who looks as if a simple restaurant owner but turns out to be the head of Vory V Zakone (people-traffickers). And obviously the heir to the throne the alcoholic son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) and his chauffeur, Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen). Lastly, an east London midwife nurse, Anna (Naomi Watts), determined to get to the source of the death of a 14-year-old sex slave, who's infant she helped delivered, with the business card she found in the teenager's diary which after translated by her uncle turns out to be full of incriminating details about drugs and prostitution.The film is partly sets the audience on a thriller ride about whether or not this decent characters will avoid a violent end, or will end up violently. Even with great direction and writing, a few questions remains; as it does! But as for the 'Cast' - their top notch performances, surely lived up way beyond expectations - As Promised!",Eastern Promises
151,shadowman123,A Darker Russian version of the Godfather?,8,8 October 2007,"My last Croenberg/Morteson review was A History Of Violence and I did not really enjoy it that much. Now this on the other hand changed my opinion of David Croenberg altogether. Judging from the trailers this did look like an interesting movie that I wanted to check out but bearing in mind that I was not a huge fan of David Croenberg I decided to give it shot anyway.Eastern Promises is the harrowing and all to true exploits of the Russian Mafia in London. Unlike the Italian Mafia which likes to almost boast of its exploits, the Russian's have a notorious habit of clean cutting business and working in highest levels of privacy. The story focus on the events of a young woman who has given birth in hospital, after her death the mid-wife(Namoi Watts) uncovers an unfolding plot which takes her into the deep,mysterious but at the same time scary world of the Russian Mafia where along the way we meet a whole host of characters.An interesting point of the film was that it was not just a plain good vs evil film . It focused on rather realistic points of view and not to mention that it showed us nothing is truly what it seems. The movie just moved along at a nice pace not quickly just moving with the atmosphere making sure that everything was seen and heard for you to take in...and always a good excuse to improve or learn some Russian. The locations used around London showed the urban nitty-gritty streets of London that we grew up in. Also the gangster shown over here were not overly exaggerated tough guys but retained that presence about them which shows that Croenberg did conduct his research properly . The acting was just nothing short of magnificent! Although you would think that Viggo Morteston with his ice cold 'do as your told' attitude which I can't remember anyone pulling off as good as Jean Reno in Leon but then Namoi Watts and Vincent Cassel were all steeling the spot light and brilliant not to mention Armin Mueller with his Marlon Brando take of a grand fatherly figure!As a matter of fact, Eastern Promises is a bit like a Ferrari F430! I was struggling to find something wrong with it! And that was just the ending which I felt could of been vastly improved! I am sure that some Empire Magazine film critic will dismiss it as an arty-farsty ending which only someone of their standards can understand ! GET LOST , IT WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH ! THAT WAS REALLY IT ! However to conclude , I wanted to hate Eastern Promises but instead it was a harrowing journey into a crime family without the romantic gangster attachments to it. Fans of Croenberg will be delighted to know that there is his trademark gore and violence in it but I have seen worse on the news ! It goes to show that you don't have to wield guns to make someone fear you. I highly recommend this to fans of the crime and gangster genre but do not go expecting a high octane blast - this one is different, and if you can respect that then trust me your in for a good time.EASTERN PROMISES: 8.8 OUT 10 EVERY SIN LEAVES A MARK",Eastern Promises

The film's synopsis was interesting to me, apparently revolving around crime and the Russian mafia.I guess I set my expectations too high. I was expecting a clever plot filled with thrill, deceit, investigation, and good mob action. Instead, what we get is heavy drama.Heavy drama is not a downside to the film. The drama, and the acting, are good. As expected in heavy drama motion pictures, the pacing is slow. Eventually, you notice it's half of the film's length, and nothing serious has happened.The plot revolves around things we know for sure. Most facts are explained on-screen or with character narration, which I kinda dislike.One unexpected plot twist opens various possibilities, but the plot doesn't exploit any of them. Because of that, this plot twist feels empty. The same goes for the ending.The film is recommendable, sure. I just think it's kinda slow and with no thrill. It's just a story that you watch from start to finish.",Eastern Promises
153,CineCritic2517,A poor man's mob-thriller,1,19 December 2007,"While we are treated with great set designs and dark-moody lighting, as well as a great cast (at least on paper), this movie will fail to enjoy the average moviegoer or anyone else who goes to the movies to see something original or somewhat surprising or sensible for that matter.As others have pointed out, this movie was basically cut in two with a dreadfully slow and rather uneventful first hour and a somewhat more pacey last half. Far too many scenes were much longer than was necessary and often annoyed me as yet another ten minutes passed and nothing worthy of note happened.I also have to comment on the most of the time incredibly weak script and laboured acting (although the two can't really be judged separately) by many of the actors who tried to portray a culture which was clearly not their own. I also thought that the constant switching between English and Russian in the dialog was pretty annoying as it has always been in films. It only made the characters even more stereotypical than they frankly already were. I kept wondering why they didn't simply get a Russian cast.I Also didn't think the story to be very original or otherwise memorable with a premise which once again in a movie fully relied on an unreal amount of naivety on the part of the protagonist (and the viewer) who was, thus suiting the character, played by a female blond (The ever so gorgeous Naomi Watts), what a horrible cliché. The plottwist was lame and insipid. Also the ending left me feeling terribly disappointed as it simply didn't make a whole lot of sense and also one that looked suspiciously like a set up for yet another even more insipid sequel.Don't be hoodwinked by the lionizing reviews that dub this movie on par with movies like The Godfather or Goodfellas. It's not even a matter of personal opinion whether it ranks with these cinematic giants or not. Common sense and some perspective will tell you it doesn't. Every movie you will look up here on IMDb, no matter how bad, will have reviews calling it: 'The best film ever made' or 'This year's best' as you will find them here as well. The big fat 8 this movie scores here on IMDb is nothing more than proof that this website has become more and more overpopularised or has been taken advantage of by film-studio companies who flood this site and inflate the polling to sell their products. One should question IMDb's policies on this for it will surely be the end of this website if they can't figure out a proper defense against it soon.In short: Unremarkable little movie that is certainly not for the average moviegoer who will probably only switch off their interest somewhere during the first (half) hour and hope they can still get their money back. Which will be their second disappointment of the evening.***/10",Eastern Promises
154,brefane,Promises more than it delivers,6,21 September 2007,"Entertaining and absorbing film that grows more diffuse as it goes on, and builds to an unsatisfying conclusion that doesn't jibe with the atmosphere of extreme fealty and violence so effectively developed during the first hour. The climax is a lot less explosive than anticipated, and the film's resolution short changes two of the film's most interesting and superbly acted characterizations, Krill and Semyon. The climactic scene involving the baby and Krill is almost laughable. Looking at times like a combination of Kirk Douglas and Frank Gorshin, Viggo Mortensen is fine, says little, and possesses a commanding stillness. The rest of the cast is first rate, and Amin Mueller Stahl as Semyon and Vincent Cassel as Krill are outstanding. The film contains well-written scenes with convincing dialog and character development though Noami Watt's character(Nancy Drew vs. the Russian mob) and the narration from the dead girl's diary begin to seem obtrusive.Though Eastern Promises doesn't completely deliver, it's an accomplished film in many respects, the supporting cast, production design and cinematography provide an authentic atmosphere, and a couple of set pieces will undoubtedly provoke strong reactions.",Eastern Promises

In reality, this is a film with some awful accents, a plot that is completely unfinished and one good fight scene.Based around an orphaned baby abandoned at a hospital and unrest within the Russian mob, Viggo is standing completely alone when it comes to reputable acting. He really is the saving grace: his persona matches the mood, and the background work he put in (learning several languages and travelling unaided around Russia) shows on screen.Both the British and Russian accents and personas feel so forced, not a single conversation feels believable. The story begins middling to say the least, but falls away even more as it builds to a conclusion. A narrated diary being the basis for all the drama is also a bit of a cop-out, especially when stereotyped Russians are central to translating the entries. The incredulity of the story's revelations was the final straw, completely breaking the reality.The proposition of a sequel (announced in 2020, thirteen years after release) is both enticing and worrying: I would like to see a conclusion to the story, but frankly I don't think it is entirely deserved.",Eastern Promises
156,RockPortReview,Viggo Mortensen Rock!!,8,3 December 2012,"This is the second collaboration by director David Cronenberg and actor Viggo Mortensen. ""Eastern Promises"" has a lot of the same aspects of their previous film ""A History of Violence"". It involves the Russian mob this time but is still chock full of brutal violence and a very dark and heavy overall atmosphere.The film takes place in London and follows Anna (Naomi Watts) who is a mid wife at a local hospital. Her story begins when an unknown young pregnant girl is rushed into the emergency room. She gives birth to a baby girl, but the mother dies. Intrigued by this woman Anna finds a journal in the girl's purse and takes it home with her. Anna lives with her mother and uncle, both of whom have strong ties to Russia. She give the journal to her Uncle for translation. They learn that the girl was named Tatiana and lived a very troubled and violent life as a prostitute. Anna also finds an address for a local Russian restaurant/social club called the Trans-Siberian. It's owned by a seemingly nice old man named Semyon. They have a friendly talk about family and the journal she found. Semyon requests to see the journal and has such a way that he is equally comforting and threatening at the same time. He is a very controlling and powerful man in the guise of a sweet old grandfather figure or should I say godfather figure..Viggo Mortensen plays Nikolai a driver for the ""club"" but also handles body processing and disposal. He is intense and cold but also calm and professional. When Anna returns to the restaurant with a photocopied version of the journal Semyon is disappointed and requests the actual journal. Anna tries to leave but her motorcycle won't start, Nikolai approaches her and offers her a ride, she hesitates but accepts. Anna has a great line that sums up the major theme of this movie ""Sometimes birth and death go together"". The connections of Anna as a life giving mid wife, and Nikolai a brutal mobster are quite apparent. Anna knows who these people are and how dangerous they can be, but she continues to search out Tatiana's family to save baby Christine and to give her a better life.Kirill is Seymon's only son and of course he is a violent drunken idiot who threatens everything his father has worked for. Nikolai sees this and, although he is not a blood relative, he looks to over take his spot in the family. Some betrayal and infighting ensues which includes the bath house scene. Nikolai is set up and must fight off a few hit men while completely nude. Cronenberg's camera doesn't shy away from showing the raw brutality and realism of the encounter. This being said Viggo has always been known for thoroughly researching his roles and inhabiting his characters and this role is no different as his performance earned him an Oscar nomination.We are told that in the Russian mob a persons life is told by their tattoos and Nikolai has several. None more important than the stars he gets over his heart and on his knees in a ceremony attended by several bosses as he becomes a made man. Certain things come to light that spins things around and we begin to look at Nikolai in a whole new way. Anna and Nikolai have an interesting relationship and must work together to achieve a common goal. Without giving away too many spoilers, this is a great movie to search out.",Eastern Promises

She tries to locate the mother's family to reluctantly give up the baby, but when she encounters mysterious driver Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), Anna ends up stumbling into the deadly, clandestine world of the Russian mafia in London.Director David Cronenberg (who also directed Mortensen in A History of Violence) does an exceptional job in keeping the dark mood of the movie, and he has an easy time with his excellent cast; they are able to credibly dissolve into the characters they play, especially Mortensen. He lost whatever traces of pretty on him for the role but he retains that compelling, visceral machismo that just fills the screen, most spectacularly displayed in the bathhouse fight scene that makes Beowulf's naked fight scene puny in comparison. He is at once powerful and vulnerable, and he expertly switches between both personalities. The tattoos all over his body amp up his sexiness; his meaningful facial expressions dare the viewer to discover that he is not all brawn. Watts once again shows her chameleon-like qualities essential to being an actor's actor; she can look 'regular' when she has to, and Vincent Cassel plays the mob boss' son Kirill with frightening emotion.Cronenberg takes his time in unraveling the story, which is a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood formulas where each trip feels familiar.

Lovely watching all French Vincent Cassel's performance as Spoiled Russian prat, very convincing. This film goes pretty deep, every corner of it seems well studied.

161,seawalker,Somewhat of a disappointment,5,29 October 2007,"Flashback to the late 1980's. At that time yer Seawalker had very clear ideas as to who he felt were the two most interesting film Directors' in the world.(Who were they, Seawalker? Tell us. We beseech you!)Ah... Glad you asked. The two most interesting film Directors' in the world, by the end of the 1980's, were David Lynch and David Cronenberg. Early on both were lumped in with the genre of what I would call 'Body Horror'. Both managed to escape that label and have made good, sometimes great, films since. It is interesting comparing how their careers have progressed.David Lynch has become more and more wilfully obscure and art house (""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"", ""Lost Highway"", ""Mulholland Drive""), culminating with (the pretty unwatchable actually) ""Inland Empire"". It is almost as if he had decided to consciously reject the mainstream audience.David Cronenberg, especially within the last 10 years or so, has turned to making increasingly mainstream films, with a peculiarly Cronenbergian bent. (""eXistenZ"", ""Spider"", ""A History Of Violence"".) By now he might have been even further along the path of the mainstream if his proposed version of ""Basic Instinct: Risk Addiction"" had been made. (I read that he quit due to creative differences with star Sharon Stone. She wanted Benjamin Bratt to co-star as the psychiatrist, Cronenberg wanted Bruce Greenwood. Maybe it was all down to who Sharon wanted to sleep with in the finished film. Interesting to note that neither actor was in the version that was eventually made.)Cronenberg's latest film is ""Eastern Promises"".Sad to say it, ""Eastern Promises"" is somewhat of a disappointment.Good performances (Viggo Mortensen, Vincent Cassel and Armin Mueller-Stahl were particularly good), and an astonishingly vicious, brutal and disturbing set piece in a Turkish bath aside, ""Eastern Promises"" is too slow, too ponderous and, yes it has to be said, too dull. Not at all like a Cronenberg film. Cronenberg's films may sometimes be off centre, but they are never dull. ""Eastern Promises"" is also nowhere near as good as ""A History Of Violence"" because I didn't give a damn about any of the characters, and that is a crying shame.So, onto the next one Mr. Cronenberg.

162,blakiepeterson,An Absorbing War Zone Of Violence,8,2 May 2015,"Mob loyalty has nothing to do with familial ties, brotherhood,  emotional neediness, or any other term that might suggest a genuine,  true bond  mob loyalty has to do with fear, a four-letter word written  in the blood of a Benedict Arnold who just had his throat slashed.  Coincidentally, Eastern Promises, a mob film, opens with an enemy  getting their neck cut open, with all the subtlety of exceptionally  over-the-top porno. This event is crossed and eventually revealed to be  connected with the death of Tatiana, a murdered (and pregnant)  14-year-old girl. Perhaps it's needed for Eastern Promises to introduce  itself with these ugly events  they prepare us for the stirring  brutality to follow.  Tatiana's nurse, Anna (Naomi Watts), is understandably disturbed by the  tragedy; only the baby is saved, the mother damaged beyond belief.  Desperate to find out who would have wanted to harm Tatiana, Anna  fortunately finds her patient's diary, with a bookmark leading to the  local Trans-Siberian Restaurant. There, she meets Semyon (Armin  Mueller- Stahl), the aging owner she initially believes to be a  friendly sort. As she gets more and more involved, though, Anna finds  that she is no longer just a woman trying to make right; she has become  a woman that has angered a nasty crime syndicate that will stop at  nothing to prevent disorder from befalling their meticulous system.  Eastern Promises also involves Semyon's driver, Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo  Mortensen), whose scrappy but slick deliverance (and tolerance) of  violence finds him climbing the rankings of the blood-stained  organization like a knife wielding vampire warrior.  David Cronenberg began his career as a horror maven with a creepy  fixation on fantastical bodily destruction, and though he still isn't  afraid to throw around explicit shots of murderous injury, he has  matured, aging from a kid fascinated by the fears of delusion to a wise  filmmaker who amplifies unease in the scope of grimy reality. Eastern  Promises is one of his best movies, a more psychotic peer to Coppola's  The Godfather. Whereas The Godfather lined itself in foreboding  placidity, ready to erupt at the nearest mini-climax, Eastern Promises  is like a panther on the prowl, searching for the slightest  misdemeanor, delighting in its punishment.  There is humanity to be found, mostly through the increasingly fearful  Anna and her anxious family, but Eastern Promises is a captivating  thriller mesmerized by the businesslike manner violence is so  frequently carried through. The mafia calls for hits, retributions, and  silences; a murder has nothing to do with emotion, but with order. Any  chance of derailment could result in the downfall of the structure  these Russians have so carefully built from scratch. Sex trafficking  also exists in their world (upsettingly, but honestly so); is it  possible that the old ideals of finding a better life in a wealthy  country can survive here? The film pushes its characters far enough to  make them wonder just how long they can continue on a path that can  only end in premature death.  Though he begins as a secondary character, Nikolai eventually becomes  the most magnetic character in Eastern Promises, as he is quickly  brought up in the ranks and progressively pushed into situations only a  grizzled veteran would be able to handle. Mortensen's performance is  simultaneously foreboding and inexplicably heroic; in his best scene,  he ferociously fights two hit men to the death in a bathhouse, his only  clothing coming in the form of his numerous tattoos. The brawl is  vicious and lethal; every hit is intensified, not only because Nikolai  has no armor to speak of, but also because it tests the boundaries he  probably never thought about overcoming.   If not for Watts' delicate performance, Eastern Promises would  cannibalize itself within its fortress of carnage; Watts serves as the  film's most optimistic aspect, standing as one of the too few  characters that will make it out of the story alive. With its balance  of character study, criminal fixation, and lingering humanity, Eastern  Promises is a successfully ambitious mob film that acts as a career  best for the always engrossing Cronenberg.",Eastern Promises
163,moutonbear25,Keeping Promises,9,22 September 2007,"When it comes to films made by veteran Canadian director, David Cronenberg, certain promises are expected to be kept. The name promises something dark and twisted, something gruesome and haunting, something disturbing and seductive. Cronenberg's latest, EASTERN PROMISES, certainly makes good on all these accounts and solidifies his new, more linear but no less disconcerting approach to film-making. Gone are the days of surreal experiments where fetishists get off on colliding cars and the ensuing scars or twin gynecologists playing patients for patsies. Now is the time for the Russian mafia in London to be given a human touch. No, now Mr. Cronenberg is not so concerned with being bizarre as he is with being blunt. As with his last masterpiece, A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, Cronenberg has made PROMISES into a straightforward story and morality tale, much to the dismay of film students everywhere. Fear not though, students. Accessibility does not make Cronenberg irrelevant. If anything, it means that brilliantly polished stories about the underbelly of humanity can be told without any unnecessary sentiment, allowing for them to be both provocative and bloody as all hell.It rains just as much in Cronenberg's London as it does in the real London. The rain ushers in the heavy yet steady hand of this director, whose work always seems to be weighed down by a looming sense of despair and discomfort. Still, though the viewer is pulled into a world where cutting the tips off of fingers and slitting throats is just as normal as a well-balanced breakfast, nothing is so simple as good and evil as absolutes. Like the sky the rain is falling from, everyone is surrounded by an ambiguous grey. Naomi Watts plays a mid-wife named Anna. On one tragic evening, Anna helps to bring a baby into the world at the expense of the very young, heroine-addicted mother's life. She does not want to see the child fall into the system as the girl cannot be identified to find her next of kin so she makes it her mission to find the girl's family before this can happen. It may all seem noble but her saintly act also serves to appease the pain she has felt since the miscarriage of her own child months before. She couldn't save her baby but she can certainly try to help this one. Her search leads her directly to the door of the Russian mafia and this is where she meets Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen). At the moment, Nikolai is just the driver but he's got hopes to one day be part of the real family. He would be perfect for the job as he is calculated and cold when he needs to be but then again not so as he also takes the time to encourage the slave sex- worker he's just been with to find a better life. People are complicated; Cronenberg knows this and this is what gives EASTERN PROMISES its depth.Though regular Cronenberg cinematographer, Peter Suschitzky, guides EASTERN PROMISES with a tranquil glide that sets the pace as both unnerving and engrossing, it is Mortensens's performance as an aspiring mafioso with a nagging sense of compassion that is most memorable and moving. His face is harsh and guarded behind his dark sunglasses and beneath his slicked back, immaculately placed hair lies a mystery that is being heavily protected. His presence is daunting as he steps from a black town car, dressed to match, from his shoes to his gloves. He is naturally imposing and his icy composure and unflinching dedication to his superiors make him frightening without really trying. He is not so much trying to intimidate others into submission though but rather to keep them away. Yet there is something about him that inspires those around him to see a reason to trust him. Perhaps it is his reliability or perhaps it is just that you know once you meet him that you would rather have him on your side than on the other. Mortensen, working with Cronenberg for the second time after his tortured performance in A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, is transformed and nearly unrecognizable as Nikolai. And while his character is extremely guarded, he still manages to find himself in a very naked position before the film's end, in what is a shocking and exhilarating fight sequence that finds Cronenberg, as God, going after Nikolai when he is at his most vulnerable. Proving himself to be a vengeful God, Cronenberg punishes his character for allowing himself to relax for three seconds to appreciate his success.The fight sequence is already being heralded as one for the books that will be talked about for years to come. I have a feeling we will be hearing just as much talk about Mortensen's performance, Steven Knight's script and Cronenberg's direction come awards season. After setting the groundwork with A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE (which I actually do prefer over EASTERN PROMISES just because it left me with more on my mind), the mainstream film community seems finally ready to reward one of its veteran contributors. If you're going to sell out, I can't imagine a better way to do it.",Eastern Promises
164,honorhorror,Absurd degree of nudity and sex scenes are trademark of David.,8,22 April 2008,"Well, don't laugh at me if I were wrong. I've just watched two movies made by David Cornernberg. The other one is A History of Violence, which also presents Viggo.This is a movie of the performance in which the most enjoyable elements are the performances of the actors. The gangster family is fabulous as you can describe. The cold-blooded but gentle father and the rough but no-brain Kirill would mark your mind in a long long period. Finally, the main character played by Viggo is wonderful, who occasionally exhibited his penis and muscles to frighten the audiences.Well, the story can be described as a bridge, a bridge between the white world and the dark gangsters' world. It is told mainly through the eyes of Naomi Watts and Viggo, as they encounter with each other because of a new-born baby. The screenplay is good in details. Viggo's character seemed very neutral, never put himself in an awkward position but always walk the edge. The movie never directly showed the dark side of Kirill's father, who was so sinful that even the son would betray him at his own conscience. But you would even sympathize with him at last.Also, American dream may not just be American Dream, it could be London dream or any other rich country dream, as it requires.",Eastern Promises

Naomi Watts continues to bring both beauty and intelligence to her roles and the supporting cast is tremendous. Vincent Cassel adds a touch of evil to a character that is beyond redemption. The color of red, both for Russia, and for the blood that spills on the screen reinforces the drama of death, as well as in life.

166,PCT1970,Cronenberg & Mortensen Team Up Again,8,11 May 2019,"Cronenberg and Mortensen team up again after, ""A History of Violence"". Cronenberg helms a bravura gangster/drama film. The entire cast including Mortensen, Watts, Cassel and Mueller-Stahl deliver superb performances. Tatiana Maslany's narration sets a vile and harrowing tone to the subjection she was put through. Mortensen is commanding however this is Cassel's finest performance. His portrayal of a despicable, loyal, jealous and violent gangster is mesmerizing. The plot is set in London and starts off with the hideous murder of a Chechen gangster. The diary of a 14 year old girl Tatiana who died during child birth is found by a British midwife Anna at the hospital which could bring down a made man in the Russian mafia, Seymon. Anna learns that Tatiana was raped and Seymon is the father. While this is going on we are introduced to Seymon's playboy son Kirill and Seymon's driver Nikolai. Nikolai carries out all of Seymon's dirty work and handles himself with a subtle covertness. Seymon bribes Anna through Nikolai to turn over the diary for fear of prosecution in turn for the location of the child's family. Anna sees a kindness in Nikolai, but also sees a violent gangster. Kirill put out the hit on the Chechen and they have arrived in London dispatching of everyone involved in the hit. Nikolai has been rising within the organization and he is made a member of the family. He receives his stars. Seymon sets up his son to be sacrificed at a bath. Seymon sends Nikolai to the meet instead. Nikolai has been betrayed but there has also been some subversion occurring all along. One last piece of evidence exist and Seymon orders Kirill to kill the baby. Nikolai and Anna arrive at the scene before Kirill has dumped the baby into the Thames. Nikolai says, ""Kirill, we don't kill little babies"". The plot is crisp, intelligent, intense, blazing, violent, duplicitous and exorcising. There are many outstanding scenes and quotes in this film. My favorite scene is at the bath where the most brutal, vicious, savage and ferocious hand to hand fight occurs that I've ever seen on film. My favorite quote is when Anna asks Nikolai, ""Why are you doing this, why are you helping us?"". Nikolai responds, ""How can I become king, if the king is still in place"". The Russian mafia is examined and in this viewer's opinion we learn that some men live by morals that transcend all else and he will go to any length to secure those morals. This film is ingenious in it's genre.",Eastern Promises

As both stories cross he finds himself being drawn to the mid-wife, as she and her own family become potential targets....Written by Steven Knight, this movie shows just what people will do not only for revenge, but also to keep secrets. Cronenberg, has directed a film that while not up to his last movie, A History Of Violence, or his masterpiece Dead Ringers, is still a gripping thriller. He's greatly helped by good performances from Watts, Sinéad Cusack, Vincent Cassel and Armin Mueller-Stahl as members of the Russian mob and an astonishing performance from Vigo Mortensen as Nikolai the driver. As an actor he is getting better and better and he deserves an Oscar nomination at least for his work here.Cronenberg doesn't skip out on the violence here either. The movie starts with a brutal throat slitting, shown in it's bloody detail, and a brilliant fight scene in a steam house between gangsters, that's bloody as hell, and for me one of the best action scenes I've seen this year.It's not all great though. A character twist at one point was a bit obvious, and the idea of a midwife hunting down a girl's family like that, or having members in her own family that are from Russia or a Russian background is a little contrived.

169,dkncd,Undercurrents in London,8,23 September 2007,"""Eastern Promises"" is David Cronenberg's crime thriller that explores a Russian crime family in London and the story of a hospital midwife that comes into contact with that family after the discovery of a dead, pregnant woman and her diary. The film is developed with a dark and rainy London that is appropriate for exploring the dark undercurrents of the Russian crime family. There is violence within the film that is very pronounced and will no doubt leave at least some people squirming in their seats.The film has great performances from all quarters. Naomi Watts is convincing as the London midwife that pursues her convictions to the last. Vincent Cassel is appropriate as the boorish and erratic Kirill. Armin Mueller-Stahl is a perfect choice for the role of the head of the Russian family, Seymon, who can switch between being warm and dangerous. Viggo Mortensen, equipped with a Russian accent, creates an interesting character in the cool-headed yet enigmatic Nikolai.The film takes time to build its effective characters and story, even if the story has some slow spots at times in the beginning. The story gains momentum as the film progresses and has some turns that help keep the film interesting. There is one turn in particular toward the end that is excellent, but the film unfortunately doesn't capitalize on it as much as it could have due to an abrupt ending.",Eastern Promises
170,pere-25366,Simply put... A modern crime masterpiece,9,10 November 2017,"With shades of film-noir and clear inspirations from legendary mob films like ""The Godfather (1972)"", ""Goodfellas (1990)"" and ""Casino (1995)"", Eastern Promises (2007) unfolds as one of the greatest modern crime films of the 21st Century. The film stars Viggo Mortensen, Naomi Watts, Vincent Cassel, and Armin Mueller-Stahl and is directed by David Cronenberg (The Fly, Videodrome, Dead Ringers). The story, one of intertwined violence, corruption and mystery, focuses on a Russian mob family who may be tied to the rape and murder of a Russian teenager living in London. Her diary, which contained the secrets leading up to her demise, is found by British-Russian midwife Anna Khitrova and compels her to fill in the missing pieces. Anna's search for these answers is accompanied by the posthumous narration of the victim.What separates this film from many modern crime films is the mood of the characters and the noirish atmosphere these moods seem to permeate. The musical score, composed by Howard Shore (""LOTR"" franchise, dare I say more), is so evocative of the time it is portraying that to call it simply 'fitting' for the film would be an understatement - it becomes a character in itself and plays an integral role in shaping the film's authenticity and style.It is so refreshing to witness a more recent film where the characters and story develop honestly, not in a contrived manner. It's a testament to the film's storytelling and respect for its audience - where feelings and inner conflicts are at the forefront; and the violence isn't so much exploited as it is a punctuation of the characters. EP pays homage to some of the greatest classic mob films while injecting enough mystery and charm in it to become a unique entry into the genre.",Eastern Promises

Only a diary written in Russian by the dead mother will shed light as to who the girl was. So what does Watts do? Does she go to the police and say ""Here you go, do your job?"" Nope, she goes to a Russian restaurant and asks the owner to translate; and wouldn't you know it, the owner happens to be a big time, Russian mobster who is connected to the dead mother! Now Watts, her family, and the baby are all in danger. But Viggo Mortensen (who plays a low-level Russian mobster), may have a way out for Watts. Is he helping Watts because he is attracted to her, or does Mortensen have his own agenda against his employers? But for the outrageous shenanigan of **SPOILER ALERT**a mobster easily stealing a baby from a hospital, this engaging drama/suspense/thriller would have received a higher grade. My most memorable, movie moment of ""Eastern Promises"" is the scene when **SPOILER ALERT**two Chechen mobsters attack Mortensen in a bath house, and Mortensen, while naked, has to fight off the big gorillas as his ding-a-ling happily swings back and forth — it is horrifying and comedic at the same time.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",Eastern Promises
173,billion_mucks,I Invite You To Look Under the Surface,10,21 January 2008,"David Cronemberg is one rare film-maker. His plays are symbolic, raw and trandescendal; enveloped in a surface of violent imagery and reticent characters. We saw his coupling with Mortensen in ""A History of Violence"", a masterpiece in where the characters where slowly overflown by their pasts and where punished by their sins in a class act movie. Always, the persona of his characters is exposed and he chisels them with a blistering talent.It looks like sins are something that attracts the obscure mind of Cronemberg, a mind I dare explore, where there is always something lurking beyond the surface. In ""Eastern Promises"", Nikolai is the chofer of the head of the Russian Mafia on London. But being a chofer is just a part of what he is really involved into; together with the son of his boss (a violent and crude Vincent Cassell) he is the pawn used into every dark business going on for the family. And Nikolai is a superbly interesting character; first because he always hides emotions behind a cool temple and second because Viggo's Oscar Worthy performance gives him, besides the physique Du rol, a deep aura and a silent context. And for every Sin he had, there is a mark on his body describing his life with tattoos. Then he is compromised with the entrance of Anna, a nurse who has a diary of powerful interest to the Boss. May I recommend the brilliant scene where Viggo fights nude against two men, because of it's sheer symbolism.Cronemberg uses every innuendo possible to grow the story a very interesting smoke. He grips us into the story, delves us emotionally to a character that is not depicted as Bad or Good. And that's Cronemberg master talent: to show us every character as he pleases, without any previous statement, blankly, and induce the spectators to play emotionally with them.What have I got left to say: Masterpiece. I invite you to look Under the Surface.",Eastern Promises
174,Craig_McPherson,"Magnificent in its brutality, story and intimacy",10,22 September 2007,"There was a time when the name David Cronenberg was synonymous with low budget Canadian horror schlock that resorted to hiring an ex porn actress for marquee value. Thankfully, those days are long behind this gifted Director who has matured into that rare blend of commercially viable cinematic artiste.With his last few films, Cronenberg has set out to probe the secrets that people keep. Whether they be the secrets of an ill mind, as in 2002's magnificently haunting Spider, or those of a sordid past (A History of Violence), or, in his most recent undertaking, Eastern Promises, the omertà of the London-based Russian mob.Starring Viggo Mortensen as Nikolai, the chauffeur/bodyguard of a Russian mob captain (Vincent Cassel) who is also the son of the local Don (played by the brilliantly restrained Armin Mueller-Stahl), Eastern Promises tells the story of Anna, a British midwife (Naomi Watts) who finds herself caught up an escalating mystery when she tries to track down the relatives of an underage Russian prostitute who died during childbirth. Armed with the young girl's diary that detailed her liaisons with members of the Vory V Zakone Russian criminal brotherhood, Anna's altruistic quest eventually leads her into a hornet's nest of prostitution, smuggling and drugs which places her, her mother, Russian-émigré uncle, as well as the surviving infant, in mortal jeopardy. Along the way, the story feeds off the ambiguity surrounding Nikolai. Is he Anna's only savior, or yet another cog in a well oiled and bloody machine? Unlike most crime dramas, Eastern Promises doesn't so much concern itself with the goings on of a crime syndicate as it does with probing the inner machinations of the characters that comprise the gang. Cronenberg is careful to hone in on human vices, the evil of the human heart, and the fears and passions of ordinary people living ordinary lives. He also knows how to deliver a brutal fight scene that will sear itself into the memories of viewers for a long time to come.By the time the credits roll, the audience will have witnessed a story that is as compelling as it is violent, and yet strangely reaffirming - undoubtedly exactly what Cronenberg set out to achieve.Yes, he's come a long way from the days when he traded in exploding heads and parasites emerging from armpits, and cinema is much richer as a result.",Eastern Promises

However, he hit the nail right on the head here. This is an immaculately crafted story of human trafficking by Russian mafioso in a part of London most Londoners rarely see but many know about. Viggo Mortensen is outstanding in his role and as is explained in the bonus features, he went to Russia to find out their mannerisms, how they speak, move etc and he pulls off being a cossack effortlessly. The rest of the cast also are very authentically eastern European and thrown in with the worldly innocence of Naomi Watts, its a powerful tale. Much has been made of the nude sauna scene, suffice to say, it does live up to expectations and while it is gory, it is necessary when considering the type of people involved. Cronenberg definitely pushes the envelope here but instead of shocking as has happened in his previous movies, he creates an immensely gritty and realistic drama that captivates the viewer from start to finish. don't miss this one.",Eastern Promises

No doubt the cast and crew did a profound study on the subject.All the actors involved do a brilliant job at being believable in their roles. Even the baby girl is so cute that one would want to have babies.The portrayal of the Russian behavior is also a high note of the film. It's the way they hug each other, their eye movement, smirking and the seeming relaxed posture. The accent is also quite decent. Best interpretation of Russians by non-Russian actors.The approach is very raw. Best example is the brutal fight in the Sauna.The plot is good, and solidly executed, but a bit pales compared to the other merits of the movie. I think the reason is that there are two - not really connected - sub-plots.

The movie is set in London amidst the ruthless Russian Mafia that also includes sundry Eastern Europeans.The movie begins with graphic scenes of a throat slitting and an under-age girl in labour spasms who eventually dies after her childbirth. We are then introduced to its main characters - Naomi Watts (Anna) as a second generation Russian midwife working in a city hospital who attends to the delivery and grows an attachment to the dead teen mother and her newborn daughter, a brilliant Viggo Mortensen (Nikolai) as the trusted driver-cum-bodygard-cum-enforcer of the Mafia patriarch, Semyon, as well as the best friend to his violent & volatile son (Kirill).Anna finds a diary from the belongings of the dead teenager which opens a can of worms with revealed connections to the Russian Mafia. More than a whodunnit, what Cronenberg presents here is a close glimpse of the people involved in the underworld, their seemingly superficial normalcy, shifting trusts and ruthless conduct.The movie also features a singular stunt sequence in a public bath/sauna which is captured in what I would just state as a raw and real brilliance.Brilliantly acted by Mortensen & Watts, this beautifully crafted, brutal & taut thriller would remain in your mind like a tattoo for times to come !!",Eastern Promises
179,wandereramor,"A cold, earthy thriller",7,5 August 2012,"If the past two decades of gangster films have taught us anything, it's that there never was much glamour in organized crime. Eastern Promises seems to be the epitome of this. Its rival Eastern European immigrant gangs seem very far removed from the slick, suit-wearing criminals of The Godfather; instead they're a group of grubby thugs scrabbling for a few inches of a shrinking world. And for all that, Cronenberg manages to draw some beauty and enchantment out of them, without discarding them -- the restaurant that the main characters operate out of has genuine charm, as does the secretly tyrannical old man that runs everything.The plot turns on a series of acts of sexual violence, which is always a bit problematic. On the one hand, it's nice to see a film which represents trafficking and the reality of most prostitution, but one can't help feeling that the woman that suffers these abuses, the already-dead Tatiana (present only in somewhat cheesy narrated diary entries), is never much more than a victim.With her dead, it falls to Naomi Watts' Anna to take care of her baby and solve the mystery of what happened to her. This feels like a bit of an upper-class saviour story, and for all that Anna tarries with the underworld, her moral superiority is never really dispelled. She's also essentialized as maternal a bit. Anna needs to be our portal into this strange (under)world, but to me she felt distant and jarring.Don't get me wrong -- Eastern Promises is a well-made film. The story unfolds slowly but ever-outwards, so that a simple task eventually ends up spawning a whole host of difficulties and a bloody war of succession. The whole thing is immaculately researched and recreated, with the detailed tattoos being the best example of this. Cronenberg certainly knows how to direct, but the whole thing comes off as a bit icy. There's only one really memorable scene, a long and brutal fight between Viggo Mortensen and a handful of attackers in a bathhouse, a scene which splices together both the violence and the homoeroticism and the underworld -- the rest of the film I've largely forgotten. And maybe that's the most telling thing: for all of the excellent execution, it's a bit forgettable.",Eastern Promises
180,tubby1,Disappointed,5,17 November 2008,"It is difficult to write about Eastern Promises because it drifts away from the start into an average film. It is hard to describe but I was left with a real blankness, a state of nothingness... It had no immediate or after effects on my thoughts or feelings.In my opinion, the tool of using excerpts from the diary of a Russian woman who dies giving birth to her child does not work. Even if one can get over the implausibility of the woman writing a diary in such desperate times, it just does not belong. The narration is an unrequired tool, which rather than increase the emotional punch makes it less so.The acting is satisfying, although Mortensen plays his role well, and he evidently went to great lengths to get into character, he is far better in 'A History of Violence' and I do not feel the script really tests him.Events in Eastern Promises are rather foreseeable along with character developments, it does not strive to be different.

Well I have just seen it and the ""BBC Production"" tag at the start just summed it all up for me. Cheap and pointless.The violence was there just for the hell of it and the sex scenes were highly predictable and added VERY little. Why the hell was he fighting in the steam baths naked? Why did he agree to this and what the hell were the assassins thinking? Taking knives? Really? This scene could have been done in seconds if they had just shot him. All that was missing was a lot of pointless dialogue before the fight started.Then there is the baby thing...ooohh...such imagination. Such a lame excuse to get Naomi involved. I was just left wondering how the hell she was going to explain having taken the baby out of the hospital at the end? Her supervisor must have gone nuts!!! Not to mention how easy it was for the gangster to take the baby out of a secure child ward. Oh, thats right, the old man earlier on told us there were doors left open. Which must have justified the bit where a stranger in black, carrying a bag, was able to ""sneek"" in. Oh come on!!!!! Sorry but there was just too much simplification in this story line and those who enjoy a ""clever"" film will not like this ""filming by numbers"" effort. So much just didn't make sense and the reveal near the end was laughable. Such a worn out cliché.Very disappointing!!!",Eastern Promises
182,littlemartinarocena,Viggo Mortensen Breaks New Ground,9,25 December 2007,"A terrific, tight, violent, homo erotic thriller with a soul and a heart and if that wasn't enough, Viggo Mortensen! He is an astonishing actor, he's always been. But now his Russian ""I'm just a driver"" goes further than most actors would have dared. He is magnetic. Cronenberg designs two lives again for him but this time the universe where he lives is made of monsters with an accent. The splendid Armin Mueller-Stahl's bonhomie doesn't fools us for a moment. ""A diary?"" That's enough for us to know and to fear. Vincent Cassel is also terrific and his down, tactile moments with Viggo Mortensen, have an erotic undercurrent that is impossible to ignore. Naomi Watts brings the heart to the proceedings without ever being sentimental. David Cronenberg, I feel, is entering a spectacular new face to his already remarkable career.",Eastern Promises
183,blackburnj-1,"Violent, brutal, uncompromising but, above all, important",9,11 February 2008,"David Cronenberg's violent, brutal and intelligent style has been much underestimated over recent years. His exploration of identity that has been so central to his career has recently moved into a more down to earth area. After ""A History of Violence"", ""Eastern Promises"" sees Cronenberg return to identity, but it is held under a gritty and unrelenting portrayal of the Russian underworld in London and sex-trafficking whilst also dealing with loyalty and family. It is a violent, cinematic and highly intelligent piece of film that is as entertaining as it is uncompromising.Steven Knight's script is snappy, brutal and intelligent. It confronts one of the UK's most unpleasant problems (the exploitation of young immigrants used in the sex trade) whilst also being a gripping gangster film. It is a fascinating plot, with a superb twist and a number of excellent moments. But is its remorseless, and therefore gutsy, style that makes the film a thoroughly important piece of work.Cronenberg, however, takes the film to a higher level. He paints the look of the film with great style, but it is in the moments of violence that he really comes into his own. Whereas other films encourage you to take some kind of pleasure in the violence, Cronenberg shows it to be as horrific as it should be. The much-hyped scene in the bath house is electric. It is an example of Cronenberg's brilliance as a director. He is a man who is not afraid of anything and, because of this, he makes the audience think about things that they'd rather not think about, but they should.He is helped in every respect by his first class cast. Viggo Mortensen is superb. His character, Nikolai, is the one who truly represents the Cronenbergian (and if that isn't a word, it should be) theme of identity. In this respect, Mortensen is ideal because he gives nothing away, but draws you in. His delivery is perfect, making every line memorable. Naomi Watts has an important part, even if it is slightly out of its depth here, so she doesn't really get the chance to spread her wings. Vincent Cassel has an absolute ball, but Armin Mueller-Stahl is the standout from the supporting cast. He plays the role perfectly, at once complex and tense.Cronenberg and Mortensen have been likened to Scorsese and De Niro, and you can see the similarities. The comparison is not false, especially in terms of quality. This film, particularly in Britain (though it's great to see it have a good impact in the States) is really important and shows Mortensen to be a brilliant performer, and one of the best of our times, and Cronenberg to be a really important director. If he remains underestimated still, he won't do so for much longer.",Eastern Promises
184,MovieZoo,Eastern Promises: delivers a punch and keeps on kicking,9,21 September 2007,"You go to movie hoping it doesn't bomb and what happens? It slaps you in the face, knocks you on your butt a few times, kicks the crap out of you and drains very little bit of hope for survival...and surprisingly makes you want more.I was totally in awe the whole time. Even during the quiet times, you look for signs to tell you where this movie is going and still get caught off guard. It takes no time to put you on the edge of your seat holding your breath, gasping for air, thanks to a demented mind who treats blood as nothing more than a spilled cup of coffee.The performances were excellent, especially from Viggo Mortenson. None were without merit; not one! If you are concerned about violence, stay the **** away. If you want mindless violence with self serving one-liners out of comic books, don't bother. But if you can take blood, violence and love in one single movie with excellent acting, direction and writing, then this movie will be one to see. Personally, I think Mortenson deserves an Oscar nom for this.9 of 10. Would have been a 10 except for the bloodshed even though it did add to the realism(yeah, I know it seems to be contradictory, but excessive bloodshed is too often unnecessary and I prefer to take a point away in every movie with excessive bloodshed no matter what. However, it almost seems Cronenberg held back to avoid overworking the flow of blood theme). And, yes, I do believe a sequel is warranted.",Eastern Promises
185,butchfilms,Interesting and entertaining film with a bad end,6,11 January 2009,"""Eastern Promises"" is very good during almost all the movie with an interesting development of its plot but it fails at the end delivering a weak and unsatisfactory final. I am not saying that this is a bad movie, on the contrary I think this is a very good one that deserved a better final, I wanted to see at the end how the character played by Vincent Cassel (the son) faced the one played by Armin Mueller-Stahl (the father). I think this movie deserves 6.5 stars because of its terrible final (with a good final I think it would deserve 7.5 stars).The performances are good, I specially liked the work of Viggo Mortensen (he is great in a fighting scene) and Armin Mueller-Stahl ( he gave class to the film) in here.This movie should have lasted 15 minutes more to see a better final, because I felt cheated (like watching a hard-fought NBA playoff game and not being allowed to watch the last 5 minutes of the final quarter)The plot is about how a midwife (Naomi Watts) gets involves with a Russian mafia family in London because of a diary left at the hospital by a just dead young woman who was related in a mysterious way with this Russian family. In trying to discover the truth she will meet Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen) the driver of the Russian family who has also secrets..........

187,Monotreme02,"Subtle, dark study of the human psyche; thickly plotted; fantastic film-making",8,9 November 2007,"Cronenberg himself has said that the crime drama doesn't interest him, nor do the inner workings of the mob which such pinnacles of the genre such as The Godfather, Goodfellas or The Sopranos indulge in with such depth and detail. Cronenberg saying this is strange because the movie's portrayal of the Russian mob in London is so in-depth without actually getting into the mechanics of it all, it must have required a lot of research on his and screenwriter Steven Knight's part, especially since this particular mob isn't as renown and infamous as, say, the Italian mob in the United States. Naturally this attention to detail sparked interest, and a quick search led to some very interesting articles about the London underground Russian mafia, and just how accurate the movie was and how acute its attention to detail was.It's quite difficult to place a finger on just what the movie is about. The key word is, surprisingly, subtlety. The film has a very rich and detailed plot but it's not about the story. The characters are very rounded but it's not about the characters. The mob workings are extremely well researched and detailed but it's not about the mob. If anything, one could say that this film is a direct and far more subtle continuation of A History of Violence, as the only thing that is really loud and exaggerated in the film is the sometimes-gruesome ultra-violence. The film carries all the themes of the grand, operatic crime movies but keeps them under the radar  trust, loyalty, inner mob workings and character. Only the violence stands out.Perhaps David Cronenberg, in continuation of his long-present themes of the inner human psyche, which have been present ever since he burst out of obscure, low-budget film-making and into the realm of more high-quality fare, has a newfound, more specific fascination with a specific aspect of the human psyche, and that is the primal drive for violence. I don't think it's a coincidence that all of the film's violence is on naked skin and almost never through some sort of artificial barrier  from throat-cutting to eye-stabbing to an incredibly choreographed and much-hyped fight scene which takes place in a bathhouse involving an all-nude Viggo Mortensen  man at his most primal, stripped-down form. Sickly and intense, Cronenberg's very particular brand of violence is brutal in its reality and in its startling, sudden nature. Characters don't just slice throats; they have to really carve and saw through them. Some scenes are truly cringe inducing, but I think that, as in A History of Violence, this is to serve Cronenberg's purpose. Although in this film, the themes of man's primal violent nature are far subtler than in the previous film.What more can be said about the film is that it truly is a visual and stylistic masterwork. In an era when even the greats like Robert Zemeckis and David Lynch are moving to digital, it's good to see that some directors remain faithfully honest to old-fashioned, stylized film. The movie is indeed very sleek and stylish, while of course remaining faithful to the gritty, underworld setting, which it must be said is almost beautifully and poetically portrayed and shot. Lighting is stark and almost romantically mellow while being very contrasted and stark, perhaps overshadowing the film's themes of duality. Cronenberg's camera is dynamic, the sets and costumes are all well designed, and in all the film just looks great and is made outstandingly well. Howard Shore's fantastic score also deserves a mention.In addition, the film is also an acting revelation. Vincent Cassel is very busy scenery chewing and does a great job at it, but the true stunners are the two stars. Naomi Watts has already proved herself to be an extremely talented actress and very capable of disappearing into roles, as seen both in the showy 21 Grams and the more subtle The Painted Veil. In this film she not only nails the accent, but she simply portrays her character in the most honest and straightforward way possible. The biggest standout is Viggo Mortensen, who will go down as one of the most devoted and hard-working actors to have never gotten his due respect. Just reading about all the research he did for the role fills me with bottomless respect and admiration, much like his vigorous preparation for the role of Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The guy just has a knack of putting his all into a role, and from what I read he went to Russia and Ukraine without a translator for weeks to try and get his own impression on the lingo, and also visited Russian prisons in order to learn the ethics and codes of these institutions. His devotion to the role is stunning and impressive  And it takes a lot of guts to act in a scene such as the steam-room fight sequence I mentioned earlier. It is of course most impressive that the French Vincent Cassel and the American Viggo Mortensen come across as one-hundred-percent convincing Russians. I must also mention the veteran of the clan, the great Armin Mueller-Stahl, who delivers a powerhouse-yet-subdued performance as pure evil; the patriarch of the Russian mob family depicted in the film. It is without a doubt his greatest role in a long time.An undeniable companion piece to A History of Violence, Cronenberg delivers a far subtler and more realistic version of his study of the human psyche and what drives us to violence. With great production value, beautiful cinematography and fantastic acting from a not so obvious but clearly stellar cast. Hopefully Cronenberg will continue making such fascinating and irresistibly entertaining films as this one.",Eastern Promises
188,JackCerf,Broken Promises,4,23 September 2007,"In sad contrast to Cronberg's History of Violence and Scorsese's Departed, this turns out to be just a routine gangster melodrama because of a fundamental script problem.SPOILER ALERT For most of the movie, the script sets up a conflict between the thieves code Nikolai lives by and the conscience apparently awakened by his attraction to Anna, promising a moral choice at the crisis. About three-quarters of the way in, we learn that Nikolai is not who we have thought he is. Once we know that, what he will do is obvious, and all of the tension and energy drain out of the movie. The climax depends on another character's utter collapse of nerve, which is not sufficiently foreshadowed, and which comes too easily without any real suspense.As long as I'm complaining, I'd also note that the justly celebrated fight between Nikolai and two Chechens sent to kill him in the Turkish bath jumps the shark because it goes on one implausible act of violence too far.",Eastern Promises

The only clue she has is the diary of the mother who is written in Russian. In the diary is also a card from a restaurant and Anna literally walks into the lions den by going there. Here she stumbles into the Russian mob who by coincidence is also responsible for the destiny of the young mother. I really liked watching the interaction between Kirill (Vincent Cassel) and Nikolaj (viggo Mortensen). Their performance as ruthless gangster becoming friends in their own twisted way was very convincing. I must say that I so far haven't been much impressed by the acting of Viggo Mortensen. I really thinks that he has a tendency to underplay his parts but in this movie it really suited him well. The best I have seen from him so far.I have one ""but"" and that is Anna's uncle Stepan.

193,BOUF,Okay script given plodding lifeless and grisly treatment by clinical director who seems to have no grasp of human interaction - unless it's gratuitously violent,3,22 October 2007,"A not bad second-rate thriller script is given a very un-thrilling treatment by a director who seems to have no concept of pace or realistic human interaction. It's about the Russian Mafia in London (starring an American, Australian, French and German cast, most of whom are allowed to ham outrageously) Viggo Mortensen does a sort of enigmatic, dark hero turn, which owes a bit more to wood than to Clint Eastwood, but he does much better than in his last film with the same director. Vincent Cassell (never as good out of French films as he is in them) as a psychopathic idiot is way over the top; Armin Mueller Stahl is suitably creepy as the Boss (I always find him creepy) but I didn't for a moment think he was Russian. Trouble is, like most of the cast, he was obviously encouraged to believe that a slow, portentous delivery of ordinary information gives it dramatic weight. Humourless Naomi Watts is alright, trying to be believable, and inject some life into her awkward scenes. There are some interesting relationships here - like between father and son, but they aren't explored. The director seems more interested in grisly violence, and clichés, and wrapping up the package with glib resolutions. If the film played at double the speed it might be more interesting.

""Eastern Promises"" definitely exceeded my expectations for a crime thriller genre film. I have not followed the progress of director David Cronenburg, since his notable science fiction films of the 1980's. Here he selects a story based on real life, about modern day Russian gangsters living in London. Based on other serious critical views and my strongly favorable impression of this film, I will definitely view and review ""A History of Violence"" at a later date.The story concerns an underage girl from Russian who collapses and gives birth to a child in London. A trauma nurse, effectively played by Naomi Watts, becomes involved in the circumstances and story of this mysterious immigrant woman. She recovers a diary from this woman and wishes to learn about her past, which leads into becoming, unknowingly acquainted with some local Russian gangsters residing in present day London.Viggo Mortenson provides the standout acting performance of the film, as the Russian mafia driver. His role was well researched with actual visits to Russian prisons and learning about the personalities and lifestyle of Russian mafia. He portrays a convincing Russian gangster, hard on the surface, but with some humanity lying hidden underneath.There are some graphic and shocking scenes of violence in the film that add to the power of the film.

How on earth this effort with a weak plot and dreadful acting can score almost 8 is beyond me. One of the most grating aspects of the film are the ridiculous accents which sound like a parody. The switching back and forth between English and Russian is embarrassingly awful. Vincent Cassel wins the award for hammiest actor with his pantomime villain, (the scene with the baby by the river is cringeworthy!!) the Naomi Watts character is as weak as dishwater and Viggo Mortensen has to be one of the most over-rated actors of all time. The 'plot', such as it is, has no tension whatsoever.

Her guide is low-level mobster (Viggo Mortensen) as they both battle their morals and their attractions to one another.No one in this film is really innocent, a lot of the time the only one you can relate to is Naomi Watts's character. You never feel any real pity or compassion for Mortensen as he is playing a bad guy, but director David Cronenberg never tries to hide this or give a false reason for his actions. This film is all about the Russian mob and their ill-gotten games as they take what is left of a morally right society and get rich off of it.Brilliant acting from both Viggo Mortensen and Naomie Watts, but also hidden acting talents from French actor Vincent Cassel who gives a great performance as a psychotic mobster but also a man who still feels some emotions and guilt for his actions.

Do I even have to go into the whole steam bath fight sequence? Mortenson plays, Nikolai the mysterious 'driver' for one of London's most notorious organized crime families. Without giving a way a few plot twists, the whole character of Nikolai, just asks more questions than it answers. Is Nikolai a man of integrity or a man of opportunity? Naomi Watts co-stars as Anna, a midwife who happens upon a world of intrigue and murder when she starts investigating the journal of a pregnant teen aged prostitute who dies while giving birth to a baby. This is the plot that sets everything into motion as Anna curious & seeking answers, gradually meets the people involved.I'm not quite sure whose is more creepier, here. Nikolai the 'undertaker', Kirill (Vincent Cassel) the volatile son and enforcer, or Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) the 'godfather' so to speak. I guess taking one look at these guys would scare some people..... My personal opinion? Cassel's Kirill. That scene where he watches as Mortenson has sex with a prostitute is just disgusting.My favorite scene is probably the one where Anna's drunken Uncle Stepan, tells her to drop the entire affair.In the end, I enjoyed this film because of it's authentic performances and because of it's subject matter and location ( London) , which shall we say went radioactively hot recently.However, this film is one of those where nothing really ends.

The movie is an intriguing peek into the dark, terrifying world of Russian organized crime syndicates in London, where brutal men deal in drugs, illegal booze smuggling, money laundering, and sex trafficking. ""Eastern Promises"" focuses on human trafficking of young girls from Eastern Europe. Naomi Watts is Anna, the daughter of a Russian immigrant who grew up in London and is thoroughly British, an empowered, feisty hospital nurse/midwife with a strong feminist streak. When one of her patients, a 14-year-old Ukrainian girl, dies after giving birth to an infant daughter, Anna develops a dogged interest in what happened to the dead girl, and is determined to save the baby from entering foster care. Anna follows up on two clues: the dead teen's diary, which details her trafficking and rape, and a business card from a local Russian supper club. She soon learns that the club is the legitimate business front of the crime syndicate, and she soon attracts the unfortunate attention of the sinister, seductive mob boss (played by veteran actor Armin Mueller-Stahl).""Eastern Promises"" takes the viewer deep inside the Russian mafia's secrecy, arcane rituals (tattoos symbolize a mobster's past criminal achievements and rank) and hierarchy, and there are several unexpected plot twists that take this movie beyond the typical crime story genre. This being a Cronenberg film, there are violent scenes, of course, all presented skillfully and realistically. If anything, the movie seemed a bit too short, as if there is more to the story that was left out for some reason. One wants to know more about Nikolai's back story: what compels him, where has he been? His murky past is only hinted at in a riveting scene where the mob bosses examine his telltale tattoos. Perhaps the studio insisted on cutting it short? ""Eastern Promises"" delighted the critics, and I can see why.

203,benjamin_lappin,"Promise In The Title, Not In The Delivery",5,15 January 2008,"David Cronenburgs follow up to the brutal ""The History Of Violence"" is a glossy well choreographed piece of cinematic entertainment set within the streets of London, which while ostensibly is a gangster film is first and foremost, one about the bonds and ties of family. However, when critiqued in its entirety as a film there are some gaping holes which do not lend themselves well to the overall feel of the film, and when compared to its contemporaries, doesn't quite achieve the heights to which it aspires. Eastern Promises is an absorbing viewing experience with London setting an epic background, composed of grey murky skies and the inevitable rain which couples quite suitably the bleakness of the film. Cronenburg has been viewing films of the genre, that much can be seen, as Eastern Promises resembles in certain circumstances ""Leon"" or ""The Beat That My Heart Skipped"", and he quite aptly has been able to create the hybrid situation of the family unit and the gangster surroundings successfully. Naomi Watts manages to project an air of innocence, while at the same time managing to come across world weary, and although she does occasionally slip into a faint Australian twang, for the most part is convincing as Anna, as she is thrust into the dangerous world of the mafia. Counterbalancing her naïveté, is the 'hitman' Nikolai as played by Viggo Mortensen, who oozes charisma on screen with a cold blooded, thick layered Russian accent who becomes entangled with Anna as the two worlds from which they come from collide.For the most part Promise is, well, promising, it's not a blistering romp but nor does it come across as a right-off, with the bath scene providing much excitement, especially for any females in the audience you may be with (I'm sure you've heard by now), that is until however, it's ripped away from you in the most grotesque manner. With gangster films which attempt to embed a sense of morality into their tale, like 'The Godfather', or like 'Leon', there must be an extended period of time devoted to the protagonist who battles the conflicting values of his better judgement and his 'obligations'. In 'The Godfather' Michael Corleone fights his family and his conscience before succumbing to being what he strived so hard not to, in 'The Beat That My Heart Skipped' Romain Duris' Thomas Seyr battles with the line of work he has fallen into due to his father against the love for the piano bestowed within him by his mother. 'Eastern Promises', sets you up with the potential for this battle being waged, and while dipping in and out of it, we as an audience never thoroughly connect to the point where we end up sweating out the decision Mortensens' Nikolai is to make. Then with the revelation of the inevitable 'twist' all sense of justice is taken from the viewer, and all the hard work is embezzled as the script manages to cheaply deviate around this key obstacle for the genre without a second thought.Were it not for this glaring violation of the genre 'Eastern Promises' would be a rip-roaring success, but the cheat only cheapens the film in itself and comes across more as an after thought as opposed to an intrinsic part of the story. This isn't to belittle or indeed not acknowledge the talents of not only the actors but the director, cinematographers and all who took part, but with so many films of the type being around and while harbouring and showing so much promise, 'Eastern' delivers something unbefitting of the director, something average.",Eastern Promises
204,janos451,'Promises delivered',8,14 September 2007,"""Eastern Promises"" will take your breath away, churn your stomach, and then leave you with memories of unforgettable characters as well as perplexing thoughts about good and evil. David Cronenberg's movie about Russian and Chechen mobsters clashing in London is more than violent - it is brutal, savage, shocking. But do not expect just an action film, exploiting blood and gore. After you shake off its terrific immediate impact (there is no way to think while watching it), you realize that ""Eastern Promises"" is also a kind of morality tale, complex and important.Only after you hold your breath, cover your eyes, and get through the movie do you realize how ""Eastern Promises"" manages to contradict Friedrich Nietzsche effectively. The German philosopher's ""Beyond Good and Evil"" denied the possibility of a universal morality. Cronenberg's film says that ethics - without expectation of rewards, in this life or a possible other one - can prevail even in the depths of great evil. The ""History of Violence"" director continues his subtle, subtext theme of upholding Anne Frank's belief that ""in spite of everything people are really good at heart,"" and he does so without a smidgen of sentimentality.There is no goodness in evidence as Viggo Mortensen's scary Russian mobster does every bidding of Armin Mueller-Stahl's chilling godfather figure, ruling ruthlessly over a family, which includes his son, a monster out of control, played brilliantly by Vincent Cassel (son of Jean-Pierre Cassel).During a pre-release press tour, Cronenberg spoke of his wish to present ""provocative, juicy stories... with complexity... showing that all monsters are sentimental and have some kind of relationship to a moral compass."" That is all true, but what makes ""Eastern Promises"" so appealing is that there is no pop psychology (or worse, pop philosophy) in or about it. The film hits you over the head with its magnificently written story (Steven Knight, of ""Dirty Pretty Things""), not with a message.The title, on one level, refers to promises made to young women in Russia, luring them to the West, where the Mob enslaves them as prostitutes. It is one of these drugged and brutalized women whose death opens the film, and brings an English nurse (Naomi Watts) into the story.As a multitude of promises, threats and tragedies unfolds, you get the maximum out of ""Eastern Promises"" with minimum advance knowledge of its story. Initially, that is. When you return to see it again, it won't matter that you'll know how it ends, you will want to re-experience what is certain to become a classic film. (""Eastern Promises"" was shown at the Toronto Festival last week, opened in San Francisco today, goes nationwide on Sept. 21.)",Eastern Promises
205,cliffhanley_,Psychological tail -wister buried in cultish gangster nightmare,8,6 November 2007,"In a hairdressers' shop in Brick Lane or maybe Essex Street, the happy and relaxed customer has his throat sliced through to the windpipe.A master of darkness, Cronenberg manages to get today's London to feel like an amalgum of the city of Holmes and Jack the Ripper, and the Vancouver, say, of the Mafia. A midwife, Anna (Watts), tends to a pregnant and haemorrhaging child prostitute who leaves in her death a diary that incriminates the local Russian gang boss (Muller-Stahl) ; Anna's plucky investigations, prompted in part by her own loss of a child, lead her to the avuncular restaurant owner Semyon, near Smithfield Market. He is, of course, more a Family man than a family man. Anna becomes involved with his drunken and violent sex-trafficking son Krill (Cassel) and the 'driver', 'undertaker' and family enforcer, the quiet and mysterious Nikolai (Mortensen).Steven Knight, who wrote 'Dirty Pretty Things', the one about the invisible and mostly illegal immigrant workers in London, scripted this one. The camera work, by Cronenberg's regular conspirator, Peter Suschitzky, makes the most of London's gritty darkness and seedy opulence. There are several key scenes, including the 'chosen one's induction clad in nothing but meaningful tattoos before a group of gang leaders, but the one which is bound to be included in even the shortest film histories will be the climax in the public baths, as the enigmatic but naked Nikolai fights for his life against two black leather Chechyen hit men, leaving the room like an abattoir.The most interesting aspect of this plot is how the 'me' figure, Anna, sails through relatively unchanged in her self and life, while all those in 'supporting roles' especially Nikolai, become steadily more rounded, and their lives are the ones we are left caring for.",Eastern Promises
206,mistarkus,Mysterious Human Nature,7,3 January 2008,"This was an entertaining movie with a very good story but the movie does not totally absorb you, like other great movies do, perhaps due to the lack of details or character ambiguity (not really knowing the characters).A SLIGHTLY different spin on the mob/gangster genre since the ethnically chosen group is Russians (and not Italians, Asians, Irish, or Jews etc.) with a setting in London. A lot of the themes, characters and plot seemed derived from other movies such as the Godfather and Departed. The movie exposes us outsiders to some of the dark undercurrents that are associated with a hardcore Russian gang such as the underage prostitution ring and the symbolic display of a man's life story on his body in the form of tattoos.It was a good, well thought out, believable story, which is clearly told and full of intrigue. Some people would prefer this simplistic way to tell a not so simple story but more details would have enriched it. Similar to the director's other movie, A History of Violence; a major theme is the morally mysterious nature of human character. As in the other movie it is interesting to see the unfolding of the plot revealing the true nature of a character which parallels, due to cinematic expertise, certain subtle transformations in the character's outward appearance. A once seemingly menacing individual is transformed to a noble one or vice versa with such subtleness that you are barely aware the character once was what he/she once was. This ultimately creates ambiguity in the character and leaves it open for the viewer to contemplate the characters true heart and at the conclusion the character's further motives. Viggo Mortensen makes the character interesting and is excellent in portraying the necessary moral ambiguity. The violence was gory and raw (perhaps realistic in mimicking what a hand to hand combat to the death would be like) and it was not gratuitous.",Eastern Promises
207,majic-5,"Plodding, Predictable, Unbelievable.",3,22 September 2007,"I've been a Viggo Mortentsen fan ever since his star turn in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Rough-hewn handsome, intense, and believable in his nobility, he's convinced me in every role in which I've seen him. As the trustworthy driver/assassin for the London branch of a Russian crime organization in this film, his taciturn steeliness is entirely appropriate for his role. Unfortunately, he's the only believable thing in this movie.My wife is usually the one who usually predicts plots and twists in movies, but even I could tell 30 seconds into the opening scene that an assassination was going to occur shortly. There was so little buildup to it that I barely flinched when it happened. For a gangster movie to start with a boring murder is a bad sign, indeed.One of the main plot lines, that a midwife tries to find the family information for an orphan whose 14-yr-old Russian mother died in childbirth, first strains, then breaks credulity. It's hard to believe that an intelligent adult in London could be  and remain  as naive as this character. Of course, if she were more savvy, the plot couldn't happen at all. The other plot line, concerning Mortentsen's true ambitions, plods along sleepily. The only real adrenaline rush happens when two Chechen thugs attempt to kill Mortentsen in a bath house. It's at this point that his character's combat training becomes apparent and sets the stage for a weak twist that is not too surprising. Given the director's intent to show that even moral monsters have a moral compass, however, the film would have been stronger had the twist been left on the cutting room floor.If you are a Mortensen fan, wait until this film comes out on DVD. If not, skip it.",Eastern Promises
208,edchin2006,Amazing CGI,7,8 February 2008,"It is surprising how realistic and graphic the photography is! (There should be an Oscar for technical wizardry somewhere.) Not so surprising is how the story unfolds. The plot, story development, and resolution had a predictability which reminded me of the time when it was against the law for a film made in the U.K. to depict criminals succeeding. Yet, with the ending never in doubt, this still turned out to be an entertaining film. The acting, photography, lighting, gritty interiors & exteriors, all contributed to a visually rewarding experience. (Did I mention the CGI? Amazingly real - except the blood, of course. One day they'll find something which changes color as blood does and which clots - then we'll really be shocked!) After all, we know how ""Beau Geste"", The Three Musketeers"", The Prisoner of Zenda"", ""A Christmas Carol"" etc. all end. Still, we can enjoy their myriad versions. This is Good vs Bad and Good wins.With a little imagination, they could've injected a bit of realism into the characters as well. The ""Good Guy"" could have an evil facet, a violent streak, or be a sociopath. And the ""Bad Guy"" might be an environmentalist who loves animals. No one is all good or all bad. Giving some depth of character or complexity to our ""Good and Bad Guys"" may violate some film-making code; but, it would really enhance the cinema experience. Maybe they think film-goers wouldn't be able to figure it out?",Eastern Promises
209,ConsistentlyFalconer,Brilliant mob thriller across the board.,8,28 June 2015,"So refreshing to see a mob thriller that doesn't look like a celluloid version of GQ magazine. Obviously Vincent Cassel is excellent, and it's worth remembering Naomi Watts was a very good actress before that Diana film all but destroyed her career but it's Viggo Mortensen who has the hardest job, playing the strong, silent, misfit anti-hero, but somehow manages to avoid being a massive cliché. And the Turkish Baths scene... Right, when I'm swimming in the sea I sometimes get the feeling that there's a shark swimming about underneath. Of course, there isn't... but that fear was even greater when I happened to be on a nudist beach one year - gentlemen, I'm sure you can understand that!

The actors,Mortensen,Cassel,Watts and Muller-Stahl were great.Authenticity of the whole Russian thing was astounding,a lot of work went into the research,which was used very well by the actors (casting was excellent). I could go on and on about the qualities and mention some of the flaws (for ex. I didn't like the double-agent twist of the story,I thought it would have worked better with Lhuzin being just a Simpleton gangster who turns out to have a heart of gold, the whole undercover twist kinda ruined the whole emotion of the movie).But the flaws certainly do not ruin the movie significantly and it's near excellent. BUT, HOWEVER ..... right after I watched it I had a bitter taste in my mouth,and it's the same with a lot of otherwise good movies of the last decade or so. I like my movies motivated,personal and humanly focused.That's what I like about directors like Martin Scorsese,Oliver Stone,Michael Cimino or Sergio Leone. They are personal and they have an agenda and it's the human drama in all its complexity that is the focus of their work.Also,their movies are driven by WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY, by their vision and emotion.Politically incorrect,sometimes manipulative,they always sacrifice some of the form for the essence.I like that,it's what makes me love a movie. With directors nowadays you got a near perfect form but a very unclear essence.Take the subject matter of this movie:Eastern Europe prostitution,Russian organized crime and immigration.Great topic.But where is the artist and the man Cronenberg in it's depiction?Where is he in all this?You can enjoy great scenes but ultimately you have to SEE what the artist thinks and feels.Especially since this is not Batman or some fictitious topic,it's a very current and painful subject matter.The tragedy and drama of the characters...USED, so we can see great performances from good actors and serve as a background for a visual masterpiece? Where is your humanity,Cronenberg? Of course,I don't mean to suggest that a movie like Schindler's List,with it's childishly biased agenda, is preferable. I just think that if you are going to have reality as a background,have the decency to have an artistic opinion and emotion.Art for art's sake may work for Batman,but with such profound and painful issues,you need to have a heart. Otherwise, you're just using the tragedy and drama of those people in order to make a good film.And that's cold. Very cold.",Eastern Promises

212,shusei,It reminds me of Soviet propaganda films...,2,15 March 2013,"From the author of ""Spider"" and ""Videodrome"", I have expected from this film far deeper and more original study of the theme.But watching ""Eastern Promises"", honestly say,left me an impression of total failure, or ""propaganda"" designed for audience of Western developed countries.If you ask Why? I will point out the following moments;1.Stereo-type characters of ""bad guys"" from ""wild East""; not only Russians, but also Chechens... They are totally lacking of the psychological depth and even lacking of consistency in their behaviors(they say and do only what's needed for the development of the plot)2.lack of dramatic tension.It's a natural result of the flatness and inconsistency of the characters.3.Utterly unrealistic representation of various organizations(Russian mafia, Hospital,FSB and Scotland Yard). The large Russian restaurant with wealthy Russian speaking clients(are they so many of them in London?) and the owner is the boss of the mafia with the same title of a popular Soviet film of Perestroika period... National security organization which is so eager to punish the Russian mafia outside their own country as to sending their men into the mafia as a spy... And the hospital, as some reviewer has already pointed out, without any security measures to prevent suspicious outsiders from visiting their nurse or stealing a new-born child...4.As many reviewers have pointed out, the plot is so flat and with little moments for our surprise, it's impossible to watch this film as an ""entertainment"", as an well-made ""genre film""(from which we will not expect so much authenticity).5. The shortcomings listed above, nevertheless, would not be so irritating, if this film doesn't pretend to be a serious drama.Its visual style is persuading the viewer to take it seriously, but of course we can't. If someone takes its story to be truthful, then the person must be a naive believer of the representation of the ethnic groups, the countries and their various organizations depicted in this film.6.In the similar way Soviet propaganda films were made. Namely, they were made on totally one-sided view to ""hostile"", ""different"" human groups. Among them there are such genius films as ""Battleship Potemkin"" and such boring films as ""Tractor drivers""(by Ivan Pyriev). The former is among masterpieces because of its formal discovery, humanistic belief and dramatic tension.If a film lacks all of them and has one-sided view to the ""East"", then what the difference between ""Eastern Promises"" and ""Tractor drivers""?",Eastern Promises
213,DesbUK,A Dull Let-down,3,31 March 2008,"David Cronenberg's first film outside of Canada was shot entirely in London and deals with the topical subject of Russian gangsters and sex trafficking in the capital. A 14-year-old Eastern European prostitute dies while giving birth in a London hospital and a nurse, Anna (Naomi Watts), attempts to find more about her via her diary. This draws her into the sinister world of Semyon (a rather boring Armin Mueller-Stahl), Russian restaurant owner and sex trafficker, as well as his violent and sleazy son Kiril (Vincent Cassel) and their driver Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen). Nikolai eventually proves to be sympathetic and Anna's ally.The script is by Steven Knight, the English writer of Dirty Pretty Things and Amazing Grace. In the opening scene, a Russian has his throat slit in a barber's chair - killed by the very cut throat razor he was being shaved with. It instantly recalls The Godfather and raises a false promise that this could be contemporary London's version - for the Italian mafia in 1940s New York now read the Russian Mafia in 2007 London. Except, I thought, does any barber's in London do shaves with an old-fashioned cut throat razor any more? The scene seems drawn from the world of movies not the reality of contemporary London life. So the film immediately starts on a false and unconvincing note.It sounds interesting but the execution is ponderous. There's no tension and no excitement, except for one fight in a Finsbury steam bath. Cronenburg brings his usual cold and uninvolving directorial style to what should be a script that horrifies and grips. The London of the film feels underpopulated and often dreary. However, Mortensen is striking as Nikolai, who looks like a 1950s rock star with his slick black hair and wears sunglasses during a damp December.",Eastern Promises
214,filmfan92,"""Promises"" delivers",9,21 September 2007,"Summer is over, and Hollywood throws us, the moviegoer, back into the realm of serious filmmakking not with a costume drama or biopic, but with a gritty crime drama about a British midwife (Naomi Watts)who gets in too deep with the Russian Mafia. The plot has been done before, but rarely this well. The characters in this film could easily become caricatures, but each actor brings his or her character to brilliant life. Armin-Muehler Stall does Oscar-worthy work here as the mob boss, and Viggo Mortensen is electrifying as a loose-cannon chauffeur. Director David Cronenberg does his part as well, directing a smart, slow-burner of a film that packs thrill upon thrill, twist upon twist, until at last we build up to the explosive climax, a visceral fistfight at a London bathouse. This scene is every bit as good as the critics are raving about. Cronenberg strips away the glamor and glee of the Big Movie Fight and gives us a raw, serious scene that feels refreshingly, gruesomely unchoreographed. Now, with a movie of such ""Godfather""-esque scope, of course things do go wrong occasionally-particularly the bloated- Hollywood-ized coda pegged onto the film's final moments. But overall, ""Eastern Promises"" is a rare, raw beast of a film, a brilliant, bloody roller-coaster ride, and another jewel in the David Cronenberg crown.",Eastern Promises
215,macktan894,Eastern Promises is like a rich novel,8,24 September 2007,"This movie delivers a London most of us will never see on the tourist circuit. We are taken deep into the Russian exile community, in which nestles the evil Vory mob, families of killers who adorn themselves with stars and symbols and behave as royalty among the swine. Their lives are drenched with blood and acts of such repulsion that you can't keep your eyes open to watch them committed. Nikolai (Mortenson) plays a driver/undertaker for this lethal family and pal of the mobster prince Kirill, who's rarely in control of his faculties. Nikolai is all control and despite his menacing airs, he manages subtle acts of kindness to all.If you've seen the movie Donnie Brasco, then you will note the parallels between the main characters Donnie and Nikolai. They spend years infiltrating their targets, becoming their enemies, forgetting their original identities. Donnie in the end is forced out of the mob by his superiors in the FBI--against his will. Psychologically, he has almost crossed over completely and has established a bond with Lefty, his mentor, whom he wants to protect. Nikolai, perhaps, has completely crossed over, attained the royalty level of his target, accepted Kirill as his brother and burden. He can't be taken away, even though he has come to love the Anna Ivanovna of ordinary Russia.I wish Nikolai had been played with more complexity, that we'd seen him fighting against his evil nature. Naomi Watts I thought was bland (and perhaps her new pregnancy drained some energy from her performance). Kirill was electrifying, haunting, excellently played by Cassell. Despite some flaws, this is movie you'll want to see twice and then purchase in DVD format.",Eastern Promises
216,ghettodogaudio06,Another Great Cronenberg Film,7,24 December 2007,"I really enjoyed this new film by David Cronenberg as I am a big supporter of Canadian directors. Cronenberg is cool because he will always talk about how he loves his Canadian roots unlike some Canadians who I won't criticize but it's amazing how the land of Hollywood changes some peoples loyalty to their own country. Cronenberg just gets more stylish and professional each film. I very much enjoy his older work like Crash and Rabid but he has done some great films in the last couple years like Spider, History Of Violence, and now this film. This dark and gruesome film portrays the Russian mafia and a family story that is very sick and sadistic. I loved the mafia characters like Viggo Mortensen. His character and the mob boss' son. Mortensen's character is very intelligent, a well trained killer and plays a henchmen for the family quit well. The Mob Boss is also very well played. I thought all the Russian accents were pretty decent and I just loved how this film like every other Cronenberg piece has that totally off beat Hollywood feel which is unique too what I call Hollywood North. Trust me people. Cronenberg is a director that is just starting to get the attention he deserves.",Eastern Promises
217,chemingineer,"Dark and Stark, with Twists and Turns!",8,31 January 2008,"Set in London, David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises is a languorously paced film narrating a sinister story of deeply troubled characters. A teenaged prostitute dies during childbirth, leaving behind a baby girl and a diary in the hands of a midwife Anna, a Russian immigrant who is recovering from a troubled relationship. But her real troubles begin when she takes the help of her uncle, a former KGB agent, to get the diary translated, so that she can locate the girl's relatives and deliver the child to them. It pits her head on with the powerful Russian Mafia in London. The opening sequence in a barber's shop where a customer gets his throat slit savagely by a razor sets the morbid tone of the film, transporting the viewer into a sordid world of sleaze and sin. Central to the film is Nikolai, the chauffeur (he calls himself a driver) of the Don, a character etched with laconic panache by Viggo Mortensen. It is a towering performance by the Danish actor, for which alone the film demands repeated viewing. No fancy camera angles, no frenetic editing, no jumpy background score, the film just tells a story in the good old fashion, relying on a cleverly crafted script with plenty of jaw dropping twists and turns, to keep the viewer engaged for every second of its 100 minutes.

Cronenberg is getting better at his craft and delivering more mainstream movies that pack a punch. His earlier movies were always interesting but fell far short of these last two efforts. This movie will join my collection as will History of Violence. It is very violent at times but not needlessly. If your looking for a movie with 10 dead mutilated bodies per minute this is not it. For an undercover cop crime drama/thriller this movie surpasses Scorceses ""the Departed"" by leaps and bounds. The movie's plot and story makes sense while the Departed's plot was full of holes.

219,Rayvyn,Wonderful Film Superb Performance By Mortensen,8,11 September 2015,"I had been wanting to see this film for years. I heard so many things about it. Well I just saw it and it's wonderful. Mortensen hit all the right notes with this performance. The other cast members were good as well.The story was not that original but that didn't matter. I've seen this movie before many times, as it had elements from many organized crime movies. The brutal father, the sniveling unworthy son and the son's best friend who knows all to well what the son is. I saw what Nikolai was early on in the film and not so subtle clues pointed to the fact that he was an undercover agent. His displeasure at the father for calling the current FSB the KGB pretty much gave it away right there.The fight scene in the shower was one of the most realistic fights I've seen on film. Fights in the movies are usually very macho and pretty. This fight in the sauna was ugly, sloppy and gory. The hero barely escaped with his life and wound up in the hospital. This is usually the case when knives are involved. In many movies the hero gets cut and just keeps on going like he didn't lose any blood.I was a bit disappointed with the ending. While it tied everything up nicely, it didn't have the payoff I was expecting.I would recommend this film to anyone who likes gangster movies.",Eastern Promises
220,gbx06,Almost but not,7,28 March 2008,"Let's see the sides. Yes, the couple Mortenssen and Cronenberg worked in an excellent manner in A history of violence and actually the way in which this actor adapts to the stories and the method of this Canadian filmmaker provokes that Eastern Promises becomes a product that delights any person who really likes movies. But the problem of this movie doesn't lie in the acting, superbly sustained, but lies within the depths of the story.While A History ... it's a certain ironic reflection of violence, the manner in which it is presented during the movie leads the viewer a feeling that bittersweet, but in Eastern that element becomes an artifice more of story and not a motivator for reflection because the absence of a plot less complacent.I don't deny that the work of this pair is a respite between all garbage, but even so the film stays in a more basic level to deliver a story worthy of any detective story without having it fall into the more critical analysis of the mafia, family, the past and treason, that shouldn't be a rule, but we expect that of a director on this level. In few words: a high-level noir cinema but never so trascendent.",Eastern Promises
221,DaveDiggler,Promises Made; Secrets Kept,8,11 January 2008,"Viggo Mortensen teams up with David Cronenberg again (""A History of Violence"") and they exceed their previous work. ""Eastern Promises"" is a gritty insight to the underworld of human trafficking in London. Viggo Mortensen delivers an Oscar worthy performance as a driver for the vor v zakone (""thief in law""). Seymon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) is also terrific and Oscar worthy as the boss of the Russian Mafia. This is one of Cronenberg's finest achievement as well as Mortensen's. Anna Khitrova, played by the always great Nomi Watts, is a mid wife in a London hospital. They remove a baby from an unconscious and hemorrhaging fourteen-year-old girl named Tatiana. Tatiana is carrying with her a diary filled with information and secrets involving Seymon and his son Kirill (Vincent Cassell). Inside the diary is a card to the restaurant owned by Seymon. Ann takes the diary to Seymon hoping to get it translated since it's all in Russian. Seymon discovers the information in the diary could be detrimental to their livelihood and his family could be in jeopardy.Seymon arrives at the hospital and tells Anna that he will find who the parents are of the mother and send the baby to the family in return for the original diary. As he does this he makes a subtle threat to the baby that Anna picks up on. Anna is a very deep character and played wonderfully by Watts. We want to see more of her because she's so good and her character is so deep and rich. She has a dark past and from the information we know we wish we could explore her more, but Cronenberg doesn't allow us to get too attached or too involved in her life. Anna's uncle Stephan (Jerzy Skolimowski) is a racist and tells her that she should not date outside her race because she is coming off a broken relationship with a black man. Stephan tells her that it's not natural to mix races and that's why her baby died inside her. Anna is such a deep character, but we don't get to find much about her which isn't necessarily a problem, but it doesn't help us connect with the characters as much as it could. Cronenberg tells the story from a distance. There are so many great things in the film that open our eyes and intrigue us about the culture and way of life and everyday activities and he doesn't just dive in. We are left wanting more, not that the story wasn't completed because it was, but there seemed to be so much information on human trafficking left untold as we're only shown glimpses of it and it's a little unfulfilling.The opening scenes brought us a throat slashing. And that slashing was ordered by Seymon sons Kirill. The murder was ordered behind Seymon's back at a barbershop. Seymon learns of this and finds out from Hazim (The owner of the barbershop) that some Chechen gangsters, brothers of the man killed by Kirill, are looking for Kirill, but they don't know what he looks like. So Seymon finds a way to resolve the situation while protecting Kirill. Seymon feels the need that he has to protect Kirill. He treats Kirill like a child because Kirill acts like a child. Cassell also gives a very good performance. He is a very weak character and we get the feeling throughout that something inside him is haunting him.Nikolai (Mortensen) is slowly climbing the ranks of the Russian Mafia from ""driver"" all the way to receiving ""stars"" which means he will now be a member of the vor v zakone. His new tattoos now mean he's a captain. Nikolai's body is covered in tattoos that tell the story of his past as does every vor. If you don't have tattoos, it's like you don't exist. At his acceptance ceremony we see every tattoo as a panel of Russian gangsters read the tattoo covered man who sits in front of them in nothing but his underwear. Completely bare. Completely open to invasion. Completely vulnerable to the probing. Nikolia's past is brought front and center and his horrid past and demonic look are very impressive. Nikolia believes in nothing but the rules of the vor v zakone. He says he died when he was 15 and he has lived their way ever since. He proves him trustworthy.When the Chechen brothers come looking for the man who killed their brother, the action heats up and we're exposed to probably hands down the greatest fight scene of all time in a steam bath where we see more than tattoos. It's a raw and powerful scene that will leave viewers gripping their chairs and will leave audience members talking.Regardless of coldness it's still something to admire. Everything is done very well and the acting is as good as it gets. The relationship between Nikolai and Kirill is something to pay close attention to. Kirill has some buried emotions in him as well. Secrets are buried within all these characters and most of them come to the fore front by the films end. Cronenberg does a nice job of portraying the Russian mafia and opening our eyes to a world of human trafficking that many didn't even know existed. I wish he explored the details of the film more because this could have been one of the greatest films I have ever seen. I liked it a lot, but it had all ingredients for me to love it.9.6/10",Eastern Promises

While the graphic violence and unusual nude scenes make the movie uncomfortable to watch, the actual plot was both pointless and predictable. The movie drags slowly toward the eventual conclusion, which does not resolve much of anything. It looks like they might have been trying for a surprising plot twist near the end. However, if the ""revelation"" was supposed to be a ""twist"" then it was ineffective because it became obvious about a third of the way into the movie. Likewise, the same underlying plot has been repeatedly with the Italian Mafia in the United States, Asian organized crime in the United States, Asia, and various parts of the British Commonwealth, and Hispanic and black street-gangs in Los Angeles and New York. The only difference is that the fall of the iron curtain implies more recent immigration to the west.What is disappointing is that after seeing the movie is that I cannot tell why it got good reviews. Usually even if I do not like a movie I can tell why others would like it. In the case of Eastern Promises, the only thing I could see was graphic violence just for the sake of having graphic violence. The main ""nude scene"" seemed more like an attempt to make the audience uncomfortable than an attempt to advance the plot. Think of the nude scene in Sacha Baron Cohen's ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" but without any attempt at humor.A comparison of Eastern Promises to the 2005 David Cronenberg / Viggo Mortensen collaboration on ""A History Of Violence"" reminds me of the the comparison between 1992's ""Batman Returns"" and 1989's original ""Batman."" In both original movies, the darkness and violence were necessary for the plot. By contrast, 1992's ""Batman Returns"" was dark for the sake of being dark while ""Eastern Promises"" shows graphic violence for the sake of showing graphic violence. Neither the Batman Returns's darkness nor Eastern Promises violence can make up for the lack of an engaging story.",Eastern Promises
225,Crannicus_Maximus,The Future of Crime Drama,9,12 September 2009,"If anything can be said about the film industry in recent years, it is that there has certainly been no shortage of crime dramas to satiate anybody's appetite. From 2006's masterfully delivered THE DEPARTED to this year's THE INTERNATIONAL, fans of the genre have had no shortage of titles from which to select. EASTERN PROMISES is another entry into the field, and by far one of the finest in the past five years.A well-written script from Steven Knight (who also wrote DIRTY PRETTY THINGS and the upcoming Scorcese/DiCaprio flick SHUTTER ISLAND, based on the Lehane novel of the same name) is brought to screen amazingly by Canadian director David Cronenberg (A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, CRASH).Spectacular characters and incredible camera work are trademarks of the film. Mortensen's Nikolai is brilliantly sinister, as well as intensely believable. It is hard to imagine him without that terrifying Russian accent, or to see him as any other character, after witnessing the depths to which he dives in this role. It is no wonder why the Academy gave him an Oscar nod for his work here.Also of note are the strong supporting turns: Vincent Cassel is pitch-perfect as the repressed homosexual Kirill, prone to sudden and potentially violent outbursts. Naomi Watts plays at the heartstrings of the audience with her turn as Anna, an innocent London woman thrust into the center of the Russian criminal underground. And Armin Mueller-Stahl renders a stunning portrayal of Semyon, the Vito Corleone of this criminal masterpiece.Brooding, pitch-dark scenery is used for much of the film, designed to depict the grungiest areas of London, England, which the Russian mafia calls home. In many ways these filthy, utterly intimidating settings act as a character themselves, calling out emotion in the viewer and preparing them for what is to come. And a public bathhouse is wonderfully transformed from a place of relaxation into the setting for one of the greatest fight sequences ever put on film.In short, EASTERN PROMISES is everything that a modern crime drama should aspire to be. It is suspenseful, intriguing, and uncompromisingly savage in its depiction of the Russian underground as it exists in England. A contemporary tour-de-force, and a coup for the genre.9/10.",Eastern Promises
226,thebengalimafia-1,Breaks all the rules of a mob film and delivers every step of the way.,9,22 October 2007,"I've always said that subtlety is sometimes more effective than the in your face approach to cinema. Eastern promises is that film. The film is about subtleties, not some over the top shoot-em-up gangster film. It's not concerned so much with how the mob works, but more with how the people who work in and for the mob live. It isn't like other mob movies. The violence is still there, but grittier. Knowing that it's from director David Cronenberg, we can easily assume that the film will break all the rules of traditional ""mob cinema,"" and it does.Set against the backdrop of a Russian gang that operates in London, the opening scenes show us a brutal murder in a barber shop. From there, we are introduced to a young girl walking through the rainy streets of London, barefoot and bleeding. Cut to a hospital room where the girl is giving birth and as the baby is born the mother dies in the hospital bed. The death of a young girl who no one knows is what sets the story in motion. As Anna Khitrova (Naomi Watts) attempts to get the girls diary translated in order to find her parents, she is introduced to a myriad of Russian criminals. From the beginning, I was thinking to myself that this is already not your typical film about organized crime. A small, isolated incident like the death of a young girl may not mean much in a traditional mob movie, but it does here, and the two deaths are more closely related than we think.As Anna digs a little deeper about the girls past, she is introduced to a Russian family and their driver, who turn out to be anything but typical. Semyon, (Armin Mueller-Stahl) comes across as a Russian patriarch who is genuinely concerned about the girl's death and the diary. As you can probably guess, there is more to him than just a restaurant owner concerned about someone who once dined in his establishment. Here we also meet Semyon's son, Kirill (Vincent Cassel); a young man who is so desperate to prove himself to his father and everyone around him that he becomes clumsy and reckless in the family's business. It's probably the reason that the film's focus is not so much about the son of the mob boss as it is about the driver, Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen). Semyon trusts Nikolai more with the day to day affairs of the gang than he does his own son, and we soon find out that Nikolai isn't just going to drive people around. At this point in the film, the fate of Anna, the mob, and the diary become intertwined. Nikolai is cold, calculating, and extremely capable of running a crime business. Soon after we are introduced to him and Kirill, it becomes obvious that the two of them are polar opposites.I went into the film thinking that this would be Viggo Mortensen's stand out performance. Strangely enough, as if there weren't enough surprises with the film, the scene stealer is Armin Mueller-Stahl. His take on Semyon is done with the same care that Marlon Brando took with Veto Corleone, but Mueller-Stahl brings a genuine Russian feel and etiquette to the character with the utmost subtlety. You never once doubt his performance or that the Semyon character is a real person. Not to say Mortensen isn't terrific. He and Vincent Cassel really get to show us what they're capable of. The pacing of the film is beautiful and the careful cinematography only adds to the carefully crafted tone. The sounds of rain and the dark colors add to the somber feeling and leave the viewer thinking that Vory V Zakone brought the harshness of the Siberian Mountains with them to London.",Eastern Promises
227,QuirkNFreckles,"Violent, but worth watching",10,17 February 2020,"This movie follows a woman who has a run in with the vory v zakone, ""thieves in law"" or the Russian mob. They prefer knives to guns, so as you can guess there is quite a bit of gore. But the story is super compelling and Viggo Mortensen is incredible. He's a fantastic actor. I'm fascinated by the vory v zakone plot line, and the meanings of the prison tattoos, which they refer to just enough to make you want more.",Eastern Promises
228,annoman,"Achieves greatness, though misses perfection.",9,22 September 2007,"'Eastern Promises,' the latest film from David Cronenberg  whose 2005 flick, 'A History of Violence,' set the standard for violence-done-right  is a daring, tautly-woven thriller about the Russian mob's involvement in the death of a young pregnant women. The screenplay, by Academy Award-nominated writer Steve Knight ('Dirty Pretty Things'), delivers viewers a fascinating (though somewhat small) array of characters, as well, and a scorching story that is as intense as it is bloody.The film follows four main characters: Nikolai (Mortensen), the driver for a prominent family of the Vory V Zakone, a very hostile organized crime union that reigns in Europe's Eastern parts; Semyon (Mueller-Stahl), the leader of the family for which Nikolai drives; Kirill (Cassel), Semyon's hot-blooded son; and Anna (Watts), a midwife at a London hospital.When a young girl dies while giving birth to her child, Anna claims her diary in an attempt to uncover any information that could lead to finding the child's relatives. The diary is written in Russian, and because Anna is unfamiliar with the language, she turns it over to her uncle, Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski), for translation. What he uncovers is unfathomable and terrifying and thrusts Anna into the violent world of the Vory, which will stop at nothing to ensure the discretion of the diary's contents.'Eastern Promises' is a film of startling power that, as would be expected from a Cronenberg film, presents a keenness for brutality and graphic violence. The film's most engaging performance is delivered by Mortensen, whose presence on screen as Nikolai Luzhin is consuming, yet mystifying, and weighs greater than even the film itself, which is still some kind of remarkable.'Promises' achieves greatness through its well-developed characters and sharp directing, though it misses perfection by not giving us more. By film's end, viewers are left slightly confused and with a feeling of dissatisfaction. Yet, despite its brevity and some minor flaws, its quality is undeniable and shouldn't be missed. So long as we're given a sequel from Mr. Cronenberg, I'll be more than satisfied. In fact, a sequel or two could be a possibility; and, if they were delivered to us, Cronenberg could have a trilogy for this generation reminiscent of 'The Godfather' trilogy.",Eastern Promises
229,ctg0724,awesome stuff,9,6 October 2007,"eastern promises was amazing. let me say what it isn't. it is not a blood thirsty gangster flick filled with meaningless gang war violence. this movie actually has a story. the actors actually act. the characters are structured. and when the violence does come, this movie does not hold back. viggo mortensen and naomi watts brought this movie home with their performances. everything else about it was awesome. the shooting, music, all of it was great. this is a mood type film. you must be able to appreciate that if you can handle the slower pace it moves at. godfather fans should be able to understand that. i hope eastern promises gets recognized come awards season.",Eastern Promises
230,regnarghost,A tired effort...,5,7 December 2007,"First of all, the direction here is flawless, Cronenberg has refined his style over the years and its always a pleasure to watch his films, they move forward effortlessly, without hesitation or any needless input and are generally well shot.Vincent Cassello and Viggo Mortensen are really convincing as gangsters and Naomi Wats makes a good work with the cute but somewhat boring girl/character that is Anna. Most memorable to me, though, was probably Kirils boss and father.Still, the story is lackluster and tired, ""deconstructing"" gangsterworlds with violence has been done sooo many times, and Chronenberg just doesn't bring anything new to the table. Even more tired is the ""twist"" that allows some romantic elements to be incorporated.",Eastern Promises
231,ZebraGreg,Some very memorable scenes in an entertaining movie - which has no humanitarian or intellectual heft.,7,22 September 2007,"This is the background of the story: The movie is about Russians living in London, and their organized crime gangs. A father (Semyon, Amin Mueller-Stahl) and a drunken son (Kirill, Vincent Cassel) are important smugglers and restaurant owners. They employ Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen) who gradually gets involved with the gang. In the meantime, an underage Russian prostitute dies during childbirth, and she was some sort sex slave associated with Russian criminals. A Russian nurse (Anna, Naomi Watts) has compassion for the dead mother and the baby, and tries to find the father. This leads to a complicated plot with some interesting twists in the end. The movie has lots of memorable graphic images. There are unexpected killings, violent sex, and naked wrestling far more brutal than in Borat. I enjoyed the movie. It had a nice blend of action and drama with enough story to keep thread together the memorable (violent/sexual) action scenes. While Semyon's family begins to look like the Godfather's Corleones it does not really; the family is not developed; there are little love in that family. There are few likable characters aside from Anna (Naomi Watts) and perhaps her Mom. The movie is a simple genre picture for entertainment only. It does a nice job of creating the enigmatic character of Nikolai, but I don't think that the drama rises to the level where we get a new insight about human nature. Viggo Mortensen does an especially nice job. I don't think the movie has a social message either. Because of the high level of violence and the lack of a social purpose to justify it, I can't recommend this movie highly, although the acting and directing are superb, the movie as a whole is merely a worthy effort.",Eastern Promises
232,mgoldhamer,Eastern Promises: Director David Cronenberg's wet dream,5,26 September 2007,"Eastern Promises' most dramatic and intensive scenes were also the most gruesome and stomach turning exploitive moments the film had to offer the audience. These scenes were so shocking that either the viewer had to avert their eyes or their attention was mesmerized to the silver screen. The rest of the film was more akin to a dream rather than a night mare: certainly not a wet dream! I give credit to the casting director for putting together a solid group of actors who instilled the impression and the concept of modern day London with the Russian Mob or what was termed the ""Vory V Zachone."" Viggo Mortensen is becoming the later day Kirk Douglas. Mr. Mortensen can assume any role and not only breath life into the character but masquerade so well that we forget he is acting. His role of Nikolai as ' the driver' is most convincing. Armin Mueller-Stahl is excellent as Semyon, the 'God-father' of the mob. Sinead Cusack as a motorcycle riding mid-wife does a very impressive job as a go- between the 'civilians' and the mob. But violence and good actors do not alone make for a great film. Nikolai is joined by the son of Semyon, as his side-kick, a mobster named Kirill. (Vincent Cassel) Nikolai and Kirill tool around London suchlike Crocket and Tubbs in an episode of Miami Vice, without the pastel colors or the sandy beaches. The rest of Mr. Cronenberg's movie is as exciting as taking the 'tubes' from Gatwick to Soho on off peak hours.

235,felix-wyderka,Unpredictable and suspenseful drama from begging to end,8,28 March 2017,"""Estern Promises"" is a great drama that inspires and is suspenseful to the very end. Viggo Mortensen delivers one of his best performances, right after ""Captain Fantastic"", and has a great chemistry with Naomi Watts and delivers a great Russian accent. The latter delivers a great performance as well and makes the viewer feel for her. The thing that most surprised me was the very authentic Russian accent by Vincent Cassel who as a Frenchman has an accent anyway but his performance is just brilliant. The story is great and is laid out in brilliant way. The movie jumps right into action in the opening sequence and then makes the viewer curious for more within the first ten minutes. A refreshing change here is that this movie is not predictable but has many twists and revelation that are very unexpected. Cronenberg portrays his characters here in an unconventional fashion but it is exactly that what makes them and the movie so interesting and intriguing. He builds up the story gradually and as the movie progresses the story unfolds in a very exciting and suspenseful way. With many medium shots and close ups the cinematography helps the viewer take in all the emotions and feelings that the characters show. In this movie facial expression often say more than words and that is exactly what the camera catches and what makes this movie so intense. All in all we can say that this is an amazing drama where all the elements fit together and where suspense is present form begging to end.",Eastern Promises

Viggo Mortenson proves himself, once again, to be amongst the finest actors in this era of film-making and surely he and Cronenberg have found a creative foil in one another. Naomi Watts offers up a considered performance that doesn't unnecessarily slide into pathos and Armin Mueller Stahl is very commanding in his portrayal as the tight lipped, S.O.B that is Semyon - the Russian 'Godfather'. Beautifully shot, the film holds your attention for the whole 100 minutes and, if anything, it almost ends rather abruptly. I guess I was looking for some kind of justice or resolve that wasn't there. I wonder if it was heavily edited in post production? Still, the film is very good and continues in a similar thematic vein from the directors previous work, 'A History of Violence'. Cronenberg is finding his rhythm in his role as the straight, independent mainstream cinema auteur and is without a doubt one of the last of the classic film-makers.",Eastern Promises

238,jusco15,jusco's review: Eastern Promises,9,24 December 2010,"Eastern Promises is a solid, electrifying thriller from David Cronenberg, also known for his critically acclaimed A History of Violence. What he has brought to the table is an intense, gritty look into the inhumane nature of people, in this case, the Russian Mafia in London. Revolving around a midwife named Anna (Naomi Watts) who stumbles upon a dead teenage girl's diary containing secrets potentially harmful to a Russian Mafia family, her interactions begin to involve the family's driver, Nikolai (Viggo Mortenson), who is anxious to be accepted by his employers as a fellow member. An unusual relationship develops between the two, shaking both lives as they find themselves caught in a web of murder and deception.From the start, you'll be made aware that this is not your nice, sit-back-and-relax thriller (too many of those around; aren't thrillers meant to thrill?). A throat-slashing murder opens the film, just the beginning of plenty more shocking events to follow. There is no mercy in this crime world, just pure ruthlessness found directed at the one who dares to step out of line.What better man to play a formidable Russian than Viggo Mortenson himself, whose fierce figure and face, that seems to represent the very nature of evil, incites dreadful shivers through your entire being? This is perfect casting; his deliverance and execution is top class. And Naomi Watts is brilliant in her role as the headstrong heroine who seeks to make a change despite the imminent dangers.There is not much action in this film. In fact, there are no guns. But, there are knives. And lots of tattoos. And an epic fight scene in a bathhouse that just blows your mind because it is so realistically frightening. At just 100 minutes, it is neither too short nor too long, it's pacing well timed to slowly reveal atrocious secrets and stir up the anxiety and excitement in the audience. Howard Shore's restrained score just adds to the mix, creating a heightened sense of tension. Though many might find David Cronenberg's realistic portrayal of the Russian Mafia too grotesque to handle, those who are able to sit through it will find themselves in for a delightfully thrilling ride.I forgot to mention: if you do not wish to see Viggo Mortenson's genitals, do NOT watch this. They get more screen time than you might expect.",Eastern Promises
239,DerBarenJude,Excellent movie on all fronts,8,11 August 2008,"David Cronenberg is in top form with Eastern Promises, an expertly acted, tightly directed thriller/mystery. Naomi Watts is excellent, if somewhat ordinary, in the lead role as a nurse who seeks to unravel the mystery of a 14 year-old Russian prostitute who died in childbirth, leaving a baby with no family and no name. Only a diary written by her mother, detailing the horrors inflicted upon her by the Russian mafia who lured her out of Russia to London with promises of a better life, only to be placed in a brothel and forced to commit unimaginable acts.Viggo Mortensen is Nikolai, ""The Driver"". At first, he appears to be every bit as cold-blooded and sadistic as his Comrades, but, as is often the case in a Cronenberg movie, not everything is as it seems. As Mortensen's character becomes more fleshed-out, so does the story. As he does in so many films, Mortensen makes the movie his own. If there is a more underrated actor in the film industry, I would be hard-pressed to name him.The plot is very good, but not great. What puts Eastern Promises on a higher tier is the incredible acting. From the violin-playing, restaurant-owner/Mafia boss Semyan, to the profanity-spewing, self-aggrandizing uncle Stepan, to the always incredible Mortensen as Nikolai, Eastern Promises will keep you tense and expectant, as you never are sure where Cronenberg is leading you, and the characters make the voyage a memorable one.Very highly recommended. 8/10.",Eastern Promises
240,Caustic Pulp,Would be solid if it wasn't a Cronenberg film.,6,22 September 2007,"Make no mistake: ""Eastern Promises"" isn't a bad film. It's engaging enough and works well enough. The problem here is that Cronenberg's style, subversiveness, and panache are by and large nowhere to be found. Instead, we have something more mundane that probably would've been better suited to a more classical director.The problem is that the script is just not that interesting, and the story is predictable. Twists that occur toward the end of the film serve no real purpose. Naomi Watts is given a rote character, but the biggest crime may be the film's subtle and steady defanging of Viggo Mortensen's Nikolai, a character who could've been ranked among some of the most terrifying men ever captured on film, but instead is degenerated to the rank of a hit-man with a heart of gold and then worse.And the much talked about scene where a nude Viggo Mortensen fights with two men? I've read it being hailed as one of the most visceral fight scenes captured on film and indeed, parts of it do make the grade, but as a whole the only notable aspect of the scene is the fact that Viggo is nude through the entire thing. This scene is one of the few points where Cronenberg shows his teeth, but it lacks the force and brutality that made ""A History of Violence"" so effective.The movie wouldn't be such a drag if Cronenberg's name wasn't plastered on it, but we've come to expect thoughtful, subversive, and challenging films from him. I've searched this film for some of that thoughtfulness. I haven't found it. Unusually banal for a director of his talent; better luck next time.",Eastern Promises
241,Grant_Price,"I bow down to you, Viggo...",8,16 January 2008,"Before I properly start, it's probably beneficial to point out that this film isn't for those having just eaten prior to the film, pregnant women, people with heart conditions, anybody that feels ill in any way, people under the age of eighteen, Russians, people whose favourite film is either Dirty Dancing or Bridget Jones's Diary or those thinking that Eastern Promises relates to Turkish Delight. Because it doesn't. It relates to a gritty, terrifying world populated by sadistic Russian gangsters who take pleasure in the macabre, eliminating anybody who poses a threat to their privileged existence and generally making other's lives a misery for their own gain.The focus of the film is mainly on Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), the chauffeur and partner of Kirill (Vincent Cassel), who is the son of mob boss Semyon (Armin Müller-Stahl) and therefore the heir apparent. Nikolai is a calm and collected customer, in direct contrast to the vociferous Kirill, who throughout the film harbours a sense of inferiority to Nikolai and at one point exerts his authority by ordering Nikolai to have sex with a prostitute. Sure, there are other ways he could have done this, but director David Cronenberg has an affinity for breasts and probably would not have been able to rest had 'Promises not contained at least one pair somewhere. Of course, in this film he has upgraded to showing male genitalia as well which is only fair. Equality for all.When not focused on Nikolai, the story centres on Anna (Naomi Watts), a nurse who becomes involved in the shadowy world of the Russians through her possession of a diary belonging to a former patient, the contents of which incriminates both Semyon and Kirill in various unspeakable acts. Soon she finds her life, as well as her mother and uncle's, in considerable danger. From the beginning the plot twists and turns and, while it may not culminate in an explosive finale, the various revelations and dramatic ending leaves you yearning for a little more, which I believe is a trait of any good film. However, this pales into insignificance in the face of Viggo Mortensen's performance. He literally steals the show. Any time that he was not on screen, I was just waiting for him to return. His accent, far from sounding annoying and false each time he opened his mouth, is a pleasure to listen to. In fact everything, right down to his razor sharp suit and tie, makes this Mortensen's most memorable character in all the films of his I've seen to date. As for the others, Watts and Cassel perform competently in their roles, though they seem content to let Mortensen overshadow every scene. Müller-Stahl doesn't especially exude menace as the main villain of the piece, except in one scene involving Watts and a baby. Special credit has to go to Anna's uncle, played by Jerzy Skolimowski, who was responsible for all the intentional laugh out loud moments of the film. Finally, it's nice to see Tamar Hassan in any role, even if he does literally find out what the sharp end of the stick feels like.There is only one minor misstep in 'Promises, when Nikolai has a meeting in a steam room with an associate, Azim. It is clear prior to this that Nikolai is being set up but just to accentuate the point in case the audience hasn't worked it out, when Azim assures him that he'll be right back after going to the toilet he stands up, walks towards the door, says something like ""Yes...right back"" and then laughs maniacally until he has exited the room. Why not just say ""I'm leaving so people can come and kill you""? It just disrupts the flow of the film, which has been effortlessly cool up until this point.To conclude, Eastern Promises is definitely worth seeing, if only for Viggo Mortensen's possibly legendary performance. People of a nervous disposition take heed: ""Now I'm going to do his teeth and cut off his fingers. You might want to leave the room.""",Eastern Promises

243,wondernat,Could've been better in so many ways but wasn't,5,17 September 2007,"I'm not really sure where all of the rave reviews are pouring in from, considering this is one of the most gratuitously violent movies I've seen in 2007 (and I actually saw ""Grindhouse""). I really wish someone had taken the time to review this honestly, and outside of the hype glow.""Eastern Promises"" is synonymous to a lazy kid who tries to do all of his chores at once without taking the care to do them well. As we all know, the end result is a half-painted fence here, a barely mowed lawn there, and a sink full of unrinsed soapy dishes. What this means for ""Eastern"" is a number of interesting ideas that never realize their full potential due to the director's unforgiving A.D.D.Firstly, it tries to portray a Russian mafia drama by employing Viggo Mortensen as a macho mafioso, whose manliness borders on ""300"" homosexuality. The end result is a near-closeted tough guy with the worst ""Russian"" accent ever. For those of you who watched Jessica Cauffiel's performance on ""D.E.B.S.,"" you'll find a very close resemblance to her accent with that of Mortensen's and Vincent Cassell's. Their accents are so horrible, the movie employs subtitles whenever Mortensen and Cassell speak of former USSR states (i.e., Georgia, Ukraine) in English.Another way they tried to portray a mob story was through the obvious formula of violence. Unfortunately for (me) mob movie fans, the violence is incredibly gratuitous. I'm usually the one in my group to enjoy a good car chase or brawl scene - therefore did I enjoy Mortensen's (unintentional) ""jingle-jangling scene?"" O yes - but definitely not for the reasons that the director had intended. Watching this 15-minute macho fest was so un-called for, and I've never been less entertained by a fight scene like this one. The carnage was so gross, and added to that, I had the ""pleasure"" of seeing Mortensen's manhood plastered all over the silver screen. ""Raw"" takes on a whole new meaning, thanks to this scene.Secondly, it attempted to convey a message about the horrors of women trafficking, but the way it was done was outright disgusting. I liked the idea that the movie might have brought some sort of attention to the problem of sex trafficking, but the way they conveyed the message was no more effective than putting up anti-pedophilia fliers at a Thai brothel. Moreover, Naomi Watts' character didn't do much because the director and the screenwriter immediately barred her from the ""boy's club."" Her ultimate crucial role in the movie? Of a health care professional who acts maternally unprofessionally by struggling to find an orphan's family. Again, the woman HAS to be the mother; otherwise she's the whore. In conclusion, watch this movie if you've got the forgiving attention span of 15 minutes. However, if you require the movie to tie all several subplots coherently, then it's definitely not for you.",Eastern Promises

It is often times difficult to make a believable movie about Russians without using real Russians. Viggo Mortenson did well in capturing the Eastern European look and wasn't horrible on the accent either. This film is delightfully brutal in the story telling. The statutory rape aspect of the plot is described and discussed in the film in a very cavalier fashion. And the fight scene in the bath house... well let's just say that it takes some chops to fight naked whether you're Russian mafia or not. As always, Cronenberg's signature graphic violence is present with rather explicit throat slitting and eye stabbing. The idea that these characters would use knives rather than guns is a good touch by Cronenberg. There is the statement in the film that one of the characters is ""old school"" KGB. In the old days, the line between the KGB and the mafia were extremely difficult to see. And both learned the value of doing things efficiently while also being thrifty. Knives are a thrifty way to kill someone. They can be made from extremely cheap materials, they don't require ammo and can be reused many times without the possibility that ballistics can identify them. But while anyone can pull a trigger and shoot someone, it takes some serious will power to do the work of stabbing someone to death, especially with the short blades they were using in the film. So a fresh, gritty, gangster movie on an often overlooked group of underdwellers.",Eastern Promises
245,nyc man,"Good movie, but could've been great",8,20 July 2008,"Okay: I liked ""Eastern Promises,"" and it has a good story line and nice twists. But what is it with those stupid English films that has people fighting with knives. What *#&@! year is this anyhow  we have guns to kill people. And the baby scene at the end, what a horrible plot device. I was happy, though, in the cellar scene, the Kirill did not smash the bottle on the floor at the end  at least some restraint. The tattoos were cool and scary, and the element of unknown certainly added to it. It was a good film. Not on the par with ""Godfather"" or ""Goodfellas,"" but still better than a lot of movies. For example: the knife scene in the baths was good, but the burning of the diary was pretty fake since the girl had made one xerox copy already and could've had another. Would a mobster son actually turn on his kingpin dad (and especially about killing a baby?), especially when the son is gay (and hence a pariah)? And don't they have security videos in hospitals (in 2007 after 9/11 happened 6 years earlier)?",Eastern Promises
246,dajemitchell,A Mortensen Masterpiece,9,8 March 2008,The star of a history of violence reunites with the same director and gives a masterful performance in Eastern Promises.A great all round film with a good supporting cast and plot. A great gangster film after recent failures it is a return to vintage like the time of goodfellas and the untouchables. Mortensen bowled me over as the cold but caring Mysterious Russian Driver. Scotland Yard informer or Mobster you never can be sure. He is deceitful as well as caring especially to Naomii Watts character.A great film.9/10.,Eastern Promises
247,brendon-kenny,Eastern Promises - Makes 'A History of Violence' look like a playground scuffle...,7,19 May 2008,"This review was originally written for South Yorkshire Newspapers - A 14-year old migrant dies during childbirth, the only clues to her identity locked within the Russian entries of her diary. A young mid-wife (Naomi Watts) attempts to translate the diary and track down the girl's family  only to be drawn into a seedy Russian underworld of people trafficking and prostitution. Eastern Promises is a modern day gangster flick, based in London and focusing on the 'Vory V Zakona', - the Russian Mafia.Following the commercial and critical success of 2005's 'A History of Violence', it comes as no surprise that Director David Cronenberg has once again cast Viggo Mortenson as his leading man. Here he plays Nikolai Luzhin, the enigmatic, hard-faced chauffeur to the son of a Russian Mobster. His easy charisma belies his ruthless nature - a cold-hearted ex-con, highly ambitious and determined to earn his 'stars' as a fully-fledged member of the Russian Mob. The part is up there with Mortenson's finest performances, (alongside Tom McKenna from the aforementioned History of Violence and Lord of the Rings' Aragorn), particularly notable as he even learnt to speak fluent Russian for the role.Mortenson captivates whenever Nikolai is on screen, giving an air of menace to his scenes that play an integral part in building the sinister tone prevalent throughout the entire film. This is abetted by a strong supporting cast, such as Restaurateur-come-Mob boss Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) who has a disarming, grandfatherly appearance, shabbily dressed, charming and laid-back, it's his piercing blue eyes and loaded assertions that hint at the danger of telling the man anything other than what he wants to hear. Rather than the short fuse and violent outbursts of say, Tony Soprano, he's confident and composed, more from the Vito Corleone School of Gangstering, albeit with a Russian accent.His son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) on the other hand, is the kind of egotistical alcoholic Schizoid that must be a real joy to play (if not to watch), subtlety being a word that has clearly not been translated into his vocabulary. Watts is as reliable as ever but clearly struggled to hide her baby-bump during the filming. It's a minor distraction, but catered for within the plot.Eastern Promises was penned by Steve Knight, the Script Writer for 2002's 'Dirty Pretty Things' and it shows. Both films have a strong moral conscience as they expose the exploitation of illegal immigrants in England's capital city. In Promises though, this can often be a little heavy handed  the narrative being provided by the dead girl is poetic and lamenting, trying to yank on the heartstrings when the plot and character performances are strong enough to render it redundant.It is Cronenberg's direction that elevates the film from its moral soapbox and formulaic gangster roots. He avoids the clichéd tourist shots of London to give a much grimier, darker vision, filming in the more dangerous areas of Hackney and Harlesden. The Director's traits of intense violence and visceral gore are all present, and will likely put the current crop of Halloween horrors to shame with eye-popping efficiency (literally!). Similarly, Cronenberg's long running trademark theme of body modification (see the Fly, EXistenZ, Crash etc.) is apparent in the numerous tattoos that cover Nikolai's body, each representing an element of his criminal past, and illustrating his experience and rank within the organisation. The audience get to see these in all of their glory (amongst other things) during a vicious bathhouse brawl in which he's wearing nothing but said tattoos. Not only is this further testament to Mortenson's dedication, but it's also the kind of daring sequence you leave the cinema talking about, and it makes the Diner scene in 'A History of Violence' look like a playground scuffle.If you like gangster movies, and you've got the stomach for it, Eastern Promises comes highly recommended. With such strong performances, stomach churning violence, and a tight plot you can't help but be drawn into a world that you probably never knew existed.",Eastern Promises
248,Gray_Balloon_Bob,An absorbing thriller with a philosophical overcoat.,9,27 January 2015,"This is a brutally visceral and haunting film about the overlap of two worlds and what this reflects of human behaviour. I know very little about Cronenberg but he seems to be a director interested in psychological and physical extremities, as in his body horrors, a History of Violence in which a man finds himself in a violent encounter which ruptures the peace of the suburban life he created for himself, and now here, where Naomi Watts plays a quiet and unassuming midwife whose safety is threatened when the death of a pregnant girl leads her to the Russian Mafia. These extremes are fascinating for numerous reasons; because they challenge our assumptions of characters, because in Cronenberg's world of uncertain people we discover with the characters that they truly are and because in Cronenberg's deft hands it's often a perfectly energised synthesis of elements. An exhaustingly visceral sequence toward the end of film demonstrated this; a completely primal and urgent fight which rests on the accumulation of character and the masterfully cinematography, editing and choreography which never glorifies what's happening or intrudes. There's a kind of distance and clinical approach to the violence here and from what I remember of A History of Violence; there are several throats slit, completely unhidden to the audience, but the film never feels like it's relishing in this, just precisely stating what has happened before arriving at the subsequent consequences. I'm reminded again of a moment in A History of Violence, where Viggo Mortenson's acknowledgement of the gun in his hand that he's just used to dispatch two murderers is also the character and presumably us acknowledging the impending consequences.I've mentioned this film so much in this short musing, but there are evidently many similarities between the two. Most obviously is the world of quiet domesticity being threatened by something darker and unforgiving. What this film does, and does well, is balancing the weight of its two main characters. In Naomi Watts' discovery of this seedy Russian Underworld, the film shifts focus to Viggo Mortenson, yet never relegates her to a supporting role, because both characters have important journeys that need to be followed through to the end. Viggo Mortenson is phenomenal, and it is odd why he has not been given more accolades, or is just talked about more often. All trace of any aspect of him you were familiar with disperses in mind when you see this performance such is the immersion, the transformation. He hasn't gone through some immense metamorphosis ala Christian Bale, but this a very physical performance, which ranges from dubious yet polite foreigner, assertive and don't –fuck-with-me, brooding and calculating, bruised, battered, and limp yet still determined and also sympathetic with some tenderness that penetrates the hardened façade he wears. This isn't mentioning the completely believable Russian accent he dons, which is entirely convincing, as is Vincent Cassel's, who plays virulent, pugnacious and sneering son of the mafia head, and Viggo's sort-of blood brother, with whom he shares such a convincing relationship, that is by turns potent and pathetic, at least on Cassel's end. This is the complete antithesis of pantomime Russian. (I perhaps neglected to mention that much of the dialogue actually is Russian.) The authenticity is all in service of the film, with the most recognisable element probably being the tattoos, which feature of the poster and on probably every piece of marketing associated with the film. The tattoos are these Russians' identities, they tell their story and their value, and as stated in the film, without tattoos you don't exist. And then there is the Father, the figure of mafia authority, the puppeteer, who operates a restaurant and a jovial and welcoming façade which is what Naoimi Watts finds when she follows the lead in a diary of the aforementioned pregnant girl. He is repulsive, yet plays well just an old, wizened man of the community. This duality is present in many places, in the restaurant that functions as both a public dining room and a meet of important criminal figures, as well as having some part in the sex-trafficking of which the pregnant girl was a victim, a conflict in Viggo's character between the honourable choices he makes for Naomi Watts and the abject violence he is regularly involved with; there is a struggle of human extremes but no definitive conclusion. Maybe there can't be. There seems to be a lot of ideas in the background, but in the 100 minute running time, they remain there, as if they're extras hired for some realism and atmosphere but not an active participation. I've read Cronenberg described as an ideas man, so maybe there is far more subtext to be procured that I can't reach. I'm in the midst of reading Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy, a book set in a world devoid of morality and that seems to have no interest in finding it, a landscape in which humanity is of little use, whereas here both morality and immorality are ever present, neither replacing the other but fuelling it. The child, born of rape, around which much of the plot gravitates, seems to symbolise this.",Eastern Promises
249,SqueakyLovesGeorgeSpahn,Promise delivered,9,9 August 2020,"I took ages to watch that, in order to avoid the classic ""Russian bad guys"" cliche, and finally saw it drawn by the actors. And Naomi Watts, Mortensen & Cassel do deliver the goods. They are absolutely outstanding. Cronenberg at his best. It´s more of an universal subject,, the trade and abuse of human beings, particularly girls, by the most rotten evildoers, & the ones caught in the crossfire. I strongly recommend, regarding the subject, ""Lilya 4-ever"" (2002, Dir. Lukas Moodysson) that film sadly stays with you forever.",Eastern Promises
250,filmquestint,Viggo Mortenssen and David Cronenberg together again,10,25 December 2007,"Russian mobsters, a rainy, murky London, a midwife and Viggo Mortensen makes this David Cronemberg film a perfect companion piece to his ""A History Of Violence"". My two favourite films of this idiosyncratic and fascinating director. Naomi Watts and motherhood go beautifully together and it's her gutsy maternal instinct that throws her in a world populated by truly horrible people. The trick is, we go with her and within that brutal world we meet some memorable characters. Viggo Mortensen, what an actor! His fearlessness is riveting, he's also beautiful beyond words. We think we can read him but we doubt our own thoughts, he's in total control of his character and of his audience. He has the face of an icon and he underplays it, over playing it. If you see History Of Violence and Eastern Promises you'll understand what I mean. This is not a film to like but to love and I loved it.",Eastern Promises
251,eulchen5,Major flaws,3,27 November 2012,"I was interested in this movie because I liked Mortensen in some other movies and I thought the topic of Russian mafia could be interesting. Unfortunately, Cronenberg didn't do a good job here. He obviously did some reseach on the tattoos but for the rest of ""Russian"" things I doubt it. There are too many clichés, and some things simply seem totally unrealistic to me. If the naive nurse would be any kind of threat to a mafia boss I'd bet they'd just kill her, or at least send some brute to get that wanted diary in an instant. I just don't believe they'd offer her a bowl of warm soup and negotiate with her. I don't know that lot about Russian mafia but I know they are a different lot and way more dangerous and unscrupulous than in this movie. But what annoyed me most is the fact that Cronenberg didn't take any real Russian actors for the movie. Sorry, but Armin Muller-Stahl, who isn't capable of speaking English properly wasn't a good choice to play a Russian gangster boss. I'm really into the sound of different languages (and my Russian is far from perfect)and it makes me angry hearing Muller-Stahl with his terrible German accent-bad English-trying to sound whatever but not Russian. I don't believe for a second he is Semjion, he is just a German guy trying hard too act. I'd love to know why Cronenberg didn't choose at least some real Russian actors. Mortensen American, Cassel French, Muller-Stahl German, the uncle from Poland etc. etc. Why? Hiring Russian actors also would have prevented all those really silly scenes where the Russian characters are among themselves and totally illogically speak broken English mixed with whatever instead of Russian. I'd bet Russian native speakers must laugh their heads off hearing the actors in Eastern promises. Too bad, would have had potential for a good movie but not like this.",Eastern Promises
252,tha_mongoose,A masterpiece,9,17 June 2010,"David Cronenberg has refined the art of movie-making over the years, reaching with Eastern Promises his highest point to boot.There is mastery in every single shot. Observe the details; how the Russian-heritage house Naomi Watts belongs to is decorated, how the Russian mafioso's restaurant is laid out, the atmosphere and decor in the whorehouses and racket-areas.Without straying from the premise and context of the film (shots of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament would hardly have been necessary) Cronenberg is successful in pictorially representing his story. Perhaps the secret ingredient here is the portrayal of these Russian lives. They themselves render the film stylish, without the need for any sugar-coatings or flashy effects.The approach is so simple the viewer doesn't even know for sure at the start where everything is taking place. The later realization that it is in fact London is irrelevant, however. It could be in any other city. What matters is what is being shown.Eastern Promises is also a deeply philosophical piece in the tenor of the subject matter it deals with. More specifically, Naomi (and the viewer) will discover that there is indeed a code of honor even amongst brigands.This leads us to Viggo Mortensen. Not having seen The Road yet I will not say it was his best performance yet, but it is from the pictures I've seem him in so far. Absolutely spot on, the way he does the heavy Russian accent when he speaks English interspersed with Russian just like Eastern Europeans with imperfect mastery of the English language do; the mannerisms, the way he carries himself, his taciturn ways masquerading his evidently superior physical capabilities.The man practically makes the movie, along with Mueller-Stahl and Cassel.There are bits of comedic relief interspersed throughout the picture, courtesy of Cronenberg. Most of them take place when Uncle Stepan (Jerzi Skolimowski) is on screen. He hilariously portrays the insensitive drunken Rus to a tee. This family of Russian heritage of which Naomi Watts is a member has undeniable chemistry together.Eastern Promises is one of the finest movies to come out of Hollywood in recent times. It masterfully mixes action; a brisk pace; with subtle tones that are as if side-stories except they're more moral than anything else. The homo-erotic vibes between Cassel and Mortensen are evident. It seems Mortensen is simply a good, kind, warm man at heart, the way he deals with Cassel.Mueller-Stahl is petrifying. His discrete manner camouflages his brutal methods. He is a beast: a man that has surrendered to sin, deluding himself that he can have his own moral guidelines. Lax ones, at that.This is probably the most authentic movie made about the Russian mafia so far coming from the West. It was clearly extensively researched and prepared. Not a sloppy affair; there are no mistakes - this is the genuine article.Unmissable. 9/10",Eastern Promises
253,zsigomiklos,I can smell a couple of Oscars...,10,5 November 2007,"David Cronenberg will be nominated for Oscar next year, that's for sure! I loved all cuts he did; there was no scene which was supposed to be even just a second shorter or longer. All the movie runs so smoothly that comforts everyone who likes the mafia genre. I just loved all the great camera work; those who cannot remember why, it just means that it was flawless. The entire cast was fabulous, all the characters were precisely chosen and everybody gave a great performance (Naomi Watts as midwife was probably at her best.) To sum up Eastern Promises; it is the most compelling & complex movie of the year with a really well-dated and well-written script. Unmissable.",Eastern Promises
254,svetlastoyanova,It is so real that is scary,10,25 March 2008,"I don't like mafia movies, but I did loved Eastern Promises. It is unexpectedly simple and yet you have few twists to the storyline that keeps it interesting. Viggo Mortesen is Nikolai, a ""driver"" for the son of a Russian mafia boss Kiril (Vincent Cassel), he drives the dead bodies to be disposed of  after he processed them professionally not to be recognised. Kiril's father Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) is an owner of a posh Russian restaurant in London, who is also behind a number of other not so legal businesses. When a 14 year old girl dies giving birth in the Trafalgar Hospital, all that is left with the baby is her diary in Russian and a business card from Semyon's restaurant. The midwife Anna (Naomi Watts), who delivers the baby, is determined to find and return it to its family. That is no ordinary family though and Anna is involved in a particularly dangerous investigation.As familiar as that plot might sound, well... it is not. The film starts with a murder and the director David Cronenberg has not spare us any of the gory details, but the world he portrays and the characters inhabiting this world would not spare us either. There are few more bloody scenes in the movie, but the feeling of a pending treat is stronger when you cannot see it. The characters are so real that they are scary, nothing fancy, not much really complicated, yet so complete and reasonable in their actions. Viggo Mortensen's performance is absolutely outstanding, his transformation is amazing, his look, his behaviour, his accent, I did not doubted for a second that he is Russian. Vincent Cassel is actually French yet his character couldn't be more authentic.Throughout the whole movie you can feel the connection between Nikolai and Anna, but they are so different in every possible way that you are not sure what that connection really is- fear or attraction. You have that constant feeling that any moment something is going to happen and you are not quite sure good or bad.I liked the way the director left a lot to the imagination, every single action the characters make leaves you guessing  what outcome it will have or what really happened, and the development of the events comes as much of a surprise as of a relief. The end is probably the best possible and again it leaves you wanting more, wondering will there be a sequel...",Eastern Promises
255,julioecolon,Promises Kept,9,24 December 2007,"This is a superbly-wrought drama that has just the right mix of tension, emotion, and violence to make it both credible and interesting. Viggo Mortensen is the show stealer, of course, and rightly so, since he invests his character with a cool, quiet reserve that allows his true sentiments to bleed through only at carefully chosen moments. His role is complex and nuanced and beautifully executed; it's a tour de force performance that hearkens back to memorable acting achievements of cinematic greats like Cagney and Bogart. The use of Christian themes (the story takes place during the Christmas season, and there is a newborn in swaddling clothes) works well to strengthen the tenuous message of hope amidst the blood-drenched world of the Russian Mafia in contemporary London. My only complaint is that we don't learn nearly enough about the character played by Naomi Watts (who is quite good, by the way). It would have evened out the story to learn more about her Russian heritage, to understand why she is still single, and to have more details on her connection to Russian culture. After all, as a character, she is supposed to feel drawn to and repulsed by a culture that is genetically her own, so Cronenberg might have thrown in one or two flashbacks of childhood memories to demonstrate the extent to which her mission is vital to her identity as a Londoner of Russian extraction. A fine film worth renting, nonetheless.",Eastern Promises
256,mnpsny,London Blues + Vor Tattoos,10,25 February 2021,"A dreary London and black tattoos collide in a perfectly dark symphony. Though this is more of a chamber piece than an orchestra like ""The Godfather"" the comparisons are apt re that seminal film. This is a modern classic playing with the same tones/pitch Coppola first synthesized.It's too bad the studio didn't follow through with a sequel as this is one of the best gangster movies of all time. Cronenberg's deft touch with violence is lighter here than some of his more overt giallo-esque splatterings, and the lack of tremendous gore fits the theme well. People usually disgusted by his body horror works will actually be able to stomach this film.And that is the tragedy in not letting the director and actors, who were willing to return, finish the story with a sequel: it is one of Cronenberg's most palatable works. Thank you for the first film, Focus Features, but gosh darn ya for not letting the second breathe.Instead of watching the sequel all we can do is mash our keys in disgust. I have very little doubt that it was budgetary concerns, not artistic merit, that sunk the sequel to one of the most well-received crime films of its era",Eastern Promises
257,drtre2006,Holy disappointing,5,17 February 2008,Well let me start by saying that I was anticipating this movie for a very long time the parties involved are ones that I've enjoyed their work in the past for example David Cronenberg and Viggo mortesen apoligies for spelling by the way. Now with that said I guess perhaps i put the film on a anticipation pedestal perhaps putting a lot of hype into it. maybe thats where i went wrong. Any way the movie started and right from the get go it entertained just like i thought and viggo was given one of his best performances yet i was in film bliss. then unexpectingly the film died before my very eyes. It was like one of those movies your left expecting the big monumental scene to come and never does it was like they put together the dream team but decided to forfeit the climax of the movie . now don't get me wrong this is still a solid movie great renter.Its just that this definitely had the potential to be on the godfather level with terms of greatness. but all in all rent it don't buy it but definitely see it.,Eastern Promises
258,philipperousseau1,visually...perfect!,9,3 October 2013,"Eastern promises, by David Cronenberg. I think that this movie is MUCH better than history of violence, which I found kind of disappointing. I don't know, I just found some similar points with those two movies because both are with Viggo Mortensen, both are extremely violent and both are by the same director. Anyway, the story is totally different in both movies. Actually, I just found it way more interesting. The story of a family and all the bad stuff happening inside of it, with a front story of one girl having a baby and a doctor saving the baby... OK, maybe I just like Naomi watts, ha ha. But this movie's got something a lot better to offer: the visual. I don't know, it attracted me. I think that the photography, the cinematography, the camera shots, the scenes in general, are just amazingly perfect. The scenes show so many details that usually filmmakers wouldn't care about and would cut it off of the movie. But not David Cronenberg, this director has a lot of talent, definitely. Go see it. If you don't like it, it's fine, I understand that. It's not the best movie of the year, but one of them in my opinion. Also, this movie got my attention concerning specific aspects that I care about when I watch movies, and this, my friends, is something that depends of every person.",Eastern Promises
259,Kiers77,Minimal sketch of a Plot,6,10 January 2009,"This movie is based on one cool gimmick: the Russian vory's culture of tattoos. Great. That too, is only explained in the extras on the DVD, but not clear to film-goer.Other than that..nothing. The character development remains cliché'd and static throughout the film. The cliché is even unbelievable. No family would really spit in a known killer thug's face. The point of the movie is: there is a gang of sex traffickers in London from Russia. End of Movie. London is not shown, the Vory's world is claustrophobic and closed..but again, this aspect of exposition is not developed in the film.However(!), Cronenberg has left room for a sequel, as the movie ends SO abruptly!

261,The_Jihadi,Not as good as A History Of Violence,5,25 December 2007,"Eastern Promises is the film that i saw recently on DVD. Just keeping this fact in my mind that i am about to watch the same Film Maker's movie who gave Controversial Gripping films such as Crash and A History Of Violence. We also have Critically Appreciated and Acclaimed actors like Naomi Watts, Viggo Mortenson and Vincent Cassel.The film opens in London with a 14 year old girl who is a Prostitute gives birth to a Baby Girl and dies. She dies in the presence of a Hospital Midwife (Naomi Watts). Naomi finds her diary which was written by this 14 year old girl who was Russian. In that diary some unwanted Truths about the underground London mafia is disclosed. Naomi knocks the door of underground mafia and meets up with Nicolai (Viggo Mortenson) who is a driver and works closely with Mafia Lord's son Kirril (Vincent Cassel). Nicolai has his own problems in this underground crime world. Viggo and Naomi tries to get closer and it is witnessed that one diary can lead to Murder, Betrayal and Double Crossing the loved ones.In my opinion i think it is wrongly said or quoted to Not-To-Expect a Film Maker's past credentials in his new movie. I am sorry but i will not agree to this. Because if Steven Spielberg makes Jurassic Park (1), And we hear that after a year or two from the success of Jurassic Park (1) we are about to see Jurassic Park (2), We will definitely expect something extra ordinary from the maker.But here somewhere David Cronenberg disappoints, Not because the film has a Slow Pace and it is too lengthy. But because you have worshiped his past film A History Of Violence and this time you get to see a film that sounds a bit repetitive and a little cold. A History Of Violence was a Hard Hitting film. But here we have a an Emotionally Charged drama publicized as a Hard Hitting film.Agreed! Drugs, Mafia's and Muders (I mean Brutal Murders). But haven't we seen this earlier in films? The only track that sounds new in this film is about a 14 year old Innocent Russian girl forced into Mafia Prostitution. This particular track has been sentenced by Naomi Watts in this film umpteen times and one stars getting bored. No! I seriously don't think that this film is a Master's DVD Collectors item.This film is just watchable once and that is it!",Eastern Promises
262,simonasidorin,Over boring,1,6 July 2008,"If I did not take in account the over inflated good reviews , I was never renting this DVD .....I still cry for the money I spend so foolishly . Anyway is a bad bad bad experience ! The movie starts with a extra bad scene , somehow I made connection with an Italian movie where Alberto Sordi was transferred from Sicily to US and forced to kill an Italian-American mobster in a New York (I think....) barber shop , the clients they pretended to see no evil , hear no evil , A.S. he is doing his job and leaves . That scene was classical but the one in EASTERN PROMISES is hilarious : the old barber made all the hints possible to the young guy to finish the sitting customer ,first he (young) is closing the door then pulling the blinds , he is concealing ,,something"" under the newspaper and then the customer is about to make acquaintance with him and shake hands he is sort of paralyzed he is not shaking hands , anyway the sitting guy who seems to be a tough guy he is killed by a retard and an old man. Only in movies !The cutting throat scene is untrue , I am not an anatomist to sense the ridicule of it !There is a long list of goofs and inadvertences , I am not gonna waste your time enumerating them all , other viewers already did that . Any comparison between EASTERN PROMISES and any another mobster movie : GODFATHER , GOODFELLAS , CORLEONE , LE CLAN DES SICILIENS.....etc is just inadequate. Some directors they use a cargo of violence in a movie to justify ,,real life"" but all the gruesome scenes in this movie are pointless.The moral is : do not get impressed by other people's opinion , only YOUR opinion is important . To choose a good movie is a matter of luck , risk and personal taste after all.",Eastern Promises
263,pushnlacs,Eastern Promises>>>>The rest of David Cronenberg's filmography,9,21 September 2007,"This is the directors best work. To be honest I've never been a big fan of Cronenberg. In fact I haven't cared for any of his work that I have seen, including A History Of Violence.I was very excited for A History of Violence but in the end was disappointed, yet for some reason I found myself very excited about his next film Eastern Promises.I am happy to say this time I wasn't disappointed in the least. This is a great film. I hope the director stays on this course because if he does I have high hopes for his next.Eastern Promises is in fact many films in one, its a crime dram/mystery, it's a mob film that studies the culture of the Russian mafia, and it's also a film of another genre. But to say which one would give to much away.I'll admit some of the violence IMO might be a little over the top for shock value and I know people will disagree but I mean come on. We are talking about a director who started in horror and it's obvious some of the insert shots are the work of a horror director looking to make you squirm.But that's OK because it doesn't take away from the film and isn't used to make up for a lack of substance. In this case it may even be a good thing since the film has everything it needs and the over the top violence is a added bonus rather than a cop out. Actually the last scene of violence isn't over the top at all and the ""eye"" scene during the bath house fight wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting. It's the mildest violence in the film actually.Now lets talk about that bath house fight. What a scene! First off let's get it out of the way, yes Vigo is naked and he let's it all hang out. That said, attention is not drawn to it and everything shown is simply unavoidable and without it the scene would be cheapened.Coming from Cronenberg I'm surprised by his restraint in regards to the nudity because IMO he likes to exploit sex and nudity but in this film this is never the case.Now that the nudity's out of the way, the scene it self is brutal. its a very realistic fight thats not prettied up in the least and involves some of the nastiest looking cuts I've ever seen on film.But while that scene gets the attention there's much more to the film, the story and characters draw you in. The performances are top notch, Vigo easily being the best. Honestly I've never thought much of him as an actor most of the time but in this film he proves me wrong. He is amazing. He is not Vigo, he is a Russian Gangster. He should be a top contender for all acting awards to come. I doubt I'll see a better performance this year.Amazing film and though I've just typed a lot of words, they can't even come close to expressing how good a film it is. You simply most see it to know!",Eastern Promises

265,bk-87668,Subtle yet brutal,8,2 December 2007,"David Cronenberg is usually remembered for his bizarre, if not perverse works. His previous work, A History Of Violence, veered off the course towards more mainstream action/thriller even though it shared the same dreamy not-quite-right quality in the atmosphere. Eastern Promises continues further down that path, approaching very close to normality.The whole cast is excellent, although I have to say Watts is the usual naive character she seems to always play. But she does that quite well. Mortensen's work has been praised and I have to say it is good. The genius of his role is not in the dialogue but in the stuff in between.Eastern Promises is a violent movie and in a good way. By that I mean if a character dies violently, it's not glossed over. The gore is not achieved by increasing the amount of blood but by showing every bit of detail. The action is a little more realistic than in A History Of Violence; Mortensen - a mafia handyman (i.e. driver, hit-man, body disposer) - is not an immortal killing machine here.The movie uses its 100 minutes efficiently, gradually building until the climax. A lot of writers would have thought ""it's not a straight-up action movie, so let's add another 15 minutes or so"". I think the ending was not as effective as the preceding movie and felt like it was rushed. I guess it is also quite predictable for anyone who's seen more than a few crime movies. But that deducts very little from the rest, as a whole this is a very good movie. Not overrated at all.",Eastern Promises
266,cogleone,Viggo gets his gonads out in gritty Russian flick,7,11 February 2008,"Saw Eastern Promises at the Prince Charles Theatre. An appropriately seedy setting for this arse revealing, balls-swinging-in-the-wind, London unflattering, enjoyable nonsense.Viggo is the driver for some flash Russian Ponce with floppy hair, whose dad is a Russian mob leader. The front for this operation is a restaurant where the grizzly faced dad serves up Eastern slop.Naomi Watts is a London nurse with her cute girl-second-next-door looks. She gets lumbered with a baby, who leads her to aforementioned Russians, and in a right pickle. Viggo seems to warm to her and warns her off.Things happen etc. Eventually Viggo is going to get clipped in the Sauna. Cue a naked fight with knives and rectum close-ups. Good lad Viggo, never one to swerve revealing his biffin. One of the hit men was in both The Football Factory and The Business. Two vile films by that lowlife South East London scum Nick Love.A great review",Eastern Promises
267,Orlando_Gardner,Promises lots but not quite delivers.,7,3 July 2008,"I liked a lot of things about Eastern Promises but also was severely let down by others.First the good, the performances of Armin Mueller-Stahl and particularly Viggo Mortensen are top notch. Stahl is his usual powerful understated self while Viggo will have the ladies slipping off their seats and the guys wishing they were even a 10th as cool as this guy. He oozes controlled menace, one look, one movement says a thousand things here in a world where one wrong look or movement could mean the end of you.The direction is unfussy without being anything really exceptional, don't know why but Cronenberg can be so hit and miss even from one scene to another in his movies. The script is quite good, very believable situations and dialogue.Now for the bad. I really like Naomi Watts, her performance in 28 Grams is enough to convince me she is one of the finest actresses around, its a pity here that she puts in one of her very worst performances. Her character is our link to every event that happens in this world but she never for one minute convinces us that she is who she is supposed to be, she's actually bordering on awful. Same as Vincent Cassel.The good things I said about the script are balanced out by the bad, it really doesn't handle the central story all the well. Maybe this is a situation where an extra 30 minutes could have made a world of difference to the movie, we are really only getting into the world presented to us when the movie seems to just pull back and give us no more. This I found disappointing.So to finish. Eastern Promises kinda tries to use a quite unbelievable premise to bring us into a world inhabited by Eastern European criminals, almost like a Russian Godfather, but misses the point as it seems not to know what story it is exactly trying to tell. I don't actually know whether it is trying to be too ambitious in giving us a complete world in the amount of time the Godfather was merely getting into its stride, or whether the story was a little too flimsy and they actually tried to flesh it out but kinda got sidetracked into telling a different story along the way.Its not a bad film, worth watching for Viggo alone, but I was still very disappointed as I'd heard great things about it.",Eastern Promises
268,why-pinto,Viggo is the man,8,19 October 2007,"This flick survives on two things: Viggo Mortensen's deep, disturbing turn as a Russian mobster and a fantastic milieu set by Cronenberg. Mortensen brings such a blazingly unfettered, arrogant exterior to the table that lightweights such as Naomi Watts burn like paper in its presence and serve not the film directly, but indirectly by playing garnish to Mortensen's meal. Even the strong Muelle-Stahl pales in comparison, which again only heightens the believability of Viggo's inevitable rise from chauffeur to... and Director Cronenberg contributes greatly by surrounding the menace with sometimes lavish, sometimes squalid, but always LUSH (if that's possible for London) surroundings which bring warm comfort to an audience watching some cold stuff go down. Excellent flick.",Eastern Promises
269,ExploringFilm,Mediocre TV movie,3,27 October 2007,"I just saw it and its not great. Its mediocre. I cant believe people praise this, like reading the first review at IMDb where some fool compares it to the works of Dostoyevsky. I mean... what kind of drugs are you on while you watch this film because I want them! Its about as subtle and layered as a sledgehammer. Characters ripped off almost entirely from the Godfather and a host of other gangster films. OK, so it also tries to show a new, rough, gritty side of London. Well, I live in London and... well, that's just a joke. Throwing bodies in the Thames, great idea. Added for effect is lots of rain and perfectly lit, characters. No, in real London Russian ex-KGB guys gets poisoned with plutonium. In this film some Arsenal fan gets his throat slit cut with a knife. Big deal. Not very shocking at all, David. Viggo-balls, fake immigrant accents and saving babies at the riverside does not make a film! And Vincent Cassel, what the hell is he doing in this? Everything about him is FRENCH. I can't possibly imagine him as a Russian. First off, I thought he was speaking french. And then I realised he was trying to do Russian. But then he did English as well. Because all Russians here in London speak half-English, half-Russian. Eh.... no, they speak Russian. ALL THE TIME. The only time they resort to English is when they need to tell the bouncer in front of the night club that their dad owns about half of russias oil and he will buy his house and burn his kids if he doesn't put them in the VIP section with 50 bottles of vodka. Cronenberg has set out with an unfinished script, and completely miscast this movie and the result is a mediocre gangster story set in a ""real"" London that truly should only belong one place - in his head.",Eastern Promises
270,Ramalama_FFF,Don't believe the hype,6,31 December 2007,"Some major problems here. The biggest one being that you simply don't care too much about the characters in this film. And that's because the film doesn't give you any reason to do so. Why would I care about the villains? Why would I care about the heroes? Is there even a hero in this? No. Some unrealistic moments, too. Some big clichés. Viggo Mortensen's hardball character for instance often comes off as being parodic. I was attracted to this because I expected some heavy drama involving Russian mobsters. All I got was some nice shots here and there, and occasionally decent acting (the problem lies with the characters, not the actors). That keeps up the grade a little bit. The rest of it, can it.",Eastern Promises
271,dougmcnair,Disappointing,3,5 October 2007,"I had very high hopes for this one, what with the tremendous acting talent the director had at his disposal here. I'm a great fan of Viggo Mortenson, Naomi Watts and Armin Mueller-Stahl (whose performance as the Israeli Prime Minister on The West Wing was brilliant). And the actors delivered 100%...but as for the story, there just wasn't any ""there"" there. The movie seems to be building up to something momentous, but it fails to deliver. And everything gets tied-up in neat little bows at the end, which wildly contradicts the tone of the movie up to that point. Another really weird contradiction is the depiction of violence here, which goes well beyond gratuitous into the realm of disgust. The Godfather films contain at least as much violence as Eastern Promises, but they depict it in powerful images that support the storyline, rather than revolting images which distract from it. That just makes no sense with the actors working so hard to portray intelligent, complex characters.So overall, Eastern Promises was an unfortunate waste of some very good performances. I hope these actors get a better venue for their talents next time.",Eastern Promises

They describe the way of Russian Mafia specificlly and beautifully, and I couldn't help thinking how much time the they spent for the research. Besides their amazing research for Russian mafia, what made this movie so special is absolutely Viggo Mortensen's acting. I've watched his acting in some movies such as ""The Road"" or ""A History of Violence"" and I didn't even care about him at all, but this time his acting definitely got my attention.Although the movie contains some violence scenes that kids definitely should not watch, those scene are not big part of movie, so you can just look away a few minutes during the scenes of violent if you are not a big fan of them.To sum up, if you are going to watch this with your kids, you probably shouldn't.

274,mjsinclair,Promises more than it delivers,8,19 November 2007,"The Russian Mafia in London, at its most ruthless  throat slitting appears to be their favourite pastime. This is a violent film which does not pull its punches. Reminiscent of ""A history of Violence"", but without the tension, without William Hurt, and without the superb climax. There is only one real fight scene, which takes place in a sauna, but it is worth waiting for, as it is of a rare pulsating, originality.Viggo Mortensen is marvellously, mysteriously menacing as Nikolai, the apparently inconsequential chauffeur, and Vincent Cassell puts in an enjoyable but inconsistent performance as Kirill, the drunken, inept Mafiosi's son. The ""grandfather"" mafia figure however, is unconvincing. I'm sorry, but one character saying ""you scare me"", does not make someone who looks and acts like everyone's favourite ""pappy"" into a ruthless Mafiosi boss.A good thriller nevertheless, which just falls short of expectations, let down by a script which doesn't do enough. Who is Mortensen's character really, and what motivates him? What was the fate of the Mafiosi grandfather? We never find out. OK, so mystery is part of the recipe, but sometimes it doesn't help to over-bake the cake.",Eastern Promises
275,marshreed,Broken Promises,2,8 October 2007,"Eastern Promises could have been the Russian Godfather. The initial plot and character development scream Oscar. The deliberate violence and ever-present tension of the underworld are masterfully presented. About halfway through the film, we learn that Viggo Mortensen's Michael Corleonesque character is actually an undercover agent. In that moment, the movie's originality all but vanishes. If the formulaic plot-twist is not disappointing enough, the tale suddenly accelerates to breakneck speed like a vehicle in need of recall. With absolutely no explanation, Viggo has unseated the head of the Russian Mob and the credits are rolling. If you have ever lost consciousness, the experience will not be unfamiliar. Gaping-plot notwithstanding, Viggo Mortenson gives a memorable performance and Naomi Watts fails to disappoint.",Eastern Promises

I can intellectualize the plot blah blah but it's just words, you have to experience this movie in a visceral sense. Once again Cronenberg owns. This story holds its candle against the Godfather even! In fact it's like apples to oranges -- however the grit on this movie almost gets stuck in your eye after you watch it. Yet in-spite of that there is so much subtlety... and precision in the theatrical aspect of the film itself.Some people complained about Naomi's acting but I think she equally nailed it down as much as Stahl, Viggo and Vincent! One can overact and dramatize every line, it takes much skill to portray just ordinary people struggling to do extraordinary things and put yourself on the line. I wonder what Russians feel about the authenticity of this but I feel the director, production designers and writers as well as the actors did their best. I know Viggo worked his butt off to get it right, if he can do Elvin lingo, he can do Russian as well!By the way -- I expected it to be dark and tragic in the end, the ending was a surprise but was a relief nonetheless",Eastern Promises
277,squicker,Why We Pay a License Fee,9,4 April 2008,"This is what we pay our license fee for...The BBC not only commissioned this film but worked on the screen play, and what a pearl this is.Stephen Knight's story counterpoints two family lives and lets us watch them unfold.Anna (Watts) is a midwife drawn into a circle of deceit and betrayal, borne of Russian gangsters. Her interface into this world is the mysterious Nikolai (Mortison).Watts and Mortison are as splendid as ever, Watts' understated performance of her character shimmies with nuances and unspoken emotion. Mortison once more proves that less is more in the power stakes.The plot is simple but unfolds naturally without any fanfares or Hollywood inspired histrionics. Cronenberg shows he is a true master of the art of classic film making, upping the tension with each scene and eschewing 'quick wins' in favour of texture and sublime character development.The dialog is honed and fitting for the characters - whose machinations are all too pertinent with current affairs.With regard to the violence. This is one of those rare films where you dread each scene; although stark reality and foreboding are the order of the day, punctuated by short stabs of extreme, but in no way gratuitous violence. The secret to this film, rather than borefests such as Hostel, is that in Eastern Promises the violence fits the film, whereas in the others the film is made to fit the violence.This is a fantastic film, it is not just one of the best films of 2007 but one of the best films I have seen.",Eastern Promises
278,Pretender-5,Not a masterpiece but STILL deserves your attention.,5,11 December 2007,"I am not a remarkable writer so please excuse me for stylistic misbehave. ;-)To me this movie was highly anticipated for several reasons:1. it features great cast 2. but mainly it was said that it's depicted Russians (living in London) and Russian's underworld (that is 'mafia') in a very remarkable and true way. It was also said that it was considered almost best David Cronenberg film by critics... Was also said (by Russian press) that it's one of a VERY VERY few movies that Russians are not showed in a grotesque way like DRINKING VODKA WITH SIBERIAN BEARS etc etcWell. What can I say. They are right.The film DID managed to depict the bit 'mafia' part of Russian sub-culture REALLY REALLY well. Starting from the prison etiquette and finishing with rules of tattoos etc etc This film surprisingly showed Russian mafia as a real part of the Eastern and Western society (since the show take place in London).About the film itself it was a drama and sad story with fine ending. The acting was good.However what can I say, this is it. The film itself (as a piece of art to say) did not managed (for me) to pull the trigger. The story was an average and the film didn't have anything to be amazed of.My opinion is that - what in THIS film considered as major achievement - the realism of showing Russian people in _appropriate_ way (played by NON Russian actors) and realism especially concerning to REAL Russian criminal culture - perhaps it is an achievement for Hollywood production but I must admit that what I have seen is not too much different from the average-good modern Russian criminal movie what has been almost ""every day"" produced in Russia. That is of course an irony. Although the cast was great and they did their roles perfectly.I didn't find this movie anything too special to feel that it's A GREAT DRAMA, like GODFATHER or something. The only good in this film is a 'Russian depiction' as I already said. Perhaps for non 'qualified' western viewer this film will be interesting as one of the rare cases with Russian realism, however for me they just showed a part of something which I have seen a LOT on our local TV and a know a lot while being a Russian myself.Forget about if you read on forums for this film that it showed Russians not correctly. God bless I am not criminal but as a Russian myself I see that the representation is quite good.The press said that they have spent several months in Russia talking to ex criminals and visiting some remote villages etc etc to FEEL the culture. Well done.Not really a masterpiece but still deserves your attention.Cheers,Leon",Eastern Promises
279,twofold420,Great Movie,10,9 February 2008,"I was surprised when I saw this movie. I just thought it was going to be OK, but I was pleasantly surprised. Cronenberg exceeded the tension he created in ""A History of Violence"" with this gripping motion picture. The story seems simple enough as a midwife gets thrown into a situation involving the Russian mob in London. Viggo Mortensen is excellent as the boss's driver, and he is my pick to win best actor, but will probably lose to Daniel Day Lewis. But it isn't just him, all of the acting is outstanding, as they give a sense of realism to the story, which make you think this could have been based on a true story. The writing is also excellent; the dialog flows really well. Besides all of that, I have to give the bulk of the credit to Cronenberg who set the mood with his use of lighting and sets amazingly well; it's such a beautiful movie to watch. Even though he focuses mostly on the acting and good story, when it's time for some violence, he goes balls out to give a powerfully shocking scene! I am now looking forward to his next film, and hopefully Viggo Mortensen will be in that one too; they seem to team up really well.",Eastern Promises

The story is really a bit weak and the ending is a let down. Was looking for something a bit more rip roaring at the end but the movie went out with a wimper.Mortenson puts on a convincing Russian performance and Cassell is really stealing the show with the psycho son impression, better than Andy Garcia's Godfather 3 version. I think this movie suffered from low budget but I don't think Cronenberg gets a lot of money to spend. Photography and staging is up to his usual standards but Crash remains his outstanding achievement. Still, entertaining enough but not one of Cronenberg's best!",Eastern Promises

The script of Eastern Promises is not as surprising and is more predictable but still works on screen. The performances are all great. Naomi Watts can do no wrong.

David Cronenberg's film has everything you could ask for in a violent, raw, dramatic & suspenseful masterpiece. Now add to that one of the best performances by an actor who proves to be extremely versatile and nothing short of brilliant, I am off course referring to Viggo Mortensen who has taken a very brave decision of playing what turned out to be a character to be remembered as ""Nikolay"" (I'll spare the unnecessary spoilers). Even one of my least favourite actresses, Amy Watts, does nothing to spoil this film, all thanks to Cronenberg's ability to keep her in the boundaries of the character she plays who serves as a background to Mortensens chilling portrayal. London as in many cases proved a perfect stage for this kind of story line, it's not Hollywood, no booms, no bangs, no special effects and no super stars. Instead we get a great script, fantastic dialogues, brilliant acting and a top notch director capable of putting together ""Eastern Promises"" - a promise well delivered.",Eastern Promises
283,hardrock666,"""Eastern Pomises"": Dominated by Viggo Mortensen",9,3 August 2008,"A young pregnant woman dies in the hospital. A young man is killed by having his throat slit in a barber chair. This isn't your typical Hollywood opening. However, this is par for the course for one David Cronenberg, a director who's gained quite a cult following over the years. It all came to a head with History of Violence, which was his most critically acclaimed film and one of my favorite films of 2005. His ability to contrast violence, sex, and fully realized characters makes other directors jealous. It does. Ask them.The story deals with Anna (Naomi Watts), a mid-wife nurse who delivers the baby of the young woman. She also discovers a diary the young woman wrote. This diary is read throughout the film by Tatiana and Anna's uncle. Tatiana was abused by the father of the baby, Soyka (Vincent Cassel). Soyka is the man who had his throat slit at the beginning of the film. Kirill is the son of Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) and a real son of a gun. All are/were members of the Vory V Zakone criminal brotherhood.Viggo Mortensen plays Nikolai not only as a driver for the family but as a voice of reason. And while he is a member of this family who kills people and does such disgusting things, Nikolai shows himself as a decent human being, particularly in a scene with a young woman he has just made love with. While Kirill seems to have a very disturbing attitude toward women and sex, Nikolai appears more sympathetic to the young prostitutes.I could probably write an entire column about Cronenberg's attitude toward sex within his films. Sex is not something erotic or enjoyable, but very dark, violent, and in most cases seen as dirty. Also, relationships between the two main characters tend to be complicated and usually contain a number of twists and turns. This film is no exception. While trailers and some of the things you've read may have you believe this is primarily a romantic drama starring Watts and Mortensen, much of the film is uncovering the mystery about what exactly happened and seemingly watch this Russian family fall apart because of what happens to young Tatiana and the father of the baby.There are a number of twists and turns throughout this film so I will not talk anymore about the plot. This is a highly regarded film for a good reason. I think this film comes to close to matching the greatness of History of Violence. Mortensen and Watts turn in excellent performances. The MVP of this film just might be Armin Mueller-Stahl as the head of the family, who may not strike you as anyone other than a gentile old man. However Semyon wields a lot of power amongst other things in this very powerful film.",Eastern Promises
284,Newairbus,Canada and Russia: on the Same Latitudes,7,21 December 2007,"When this Caligula of a película started, delightfully with no trailers for other films, I remarked casually to the punter in the next seat that the premise of the film reminded me of ""Dirty Pretty Things"" by Stephen Frears. Murmuring back, the pretty poor thing had probably not even heard of it. I was right, none the less, since these two films share the scriptwriter. Also, the milieux are overlapping in the same city. The questions the film raises are these: what atrocities take place in London while Gordon Brown, the Tories, Labour MPs, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, Kensington and Marble Arch look the other way into their sedentary lives?The film is a tour de force for Steve Knight who wrote the script rather than David Cronenberg. His probably was 11 years ago when ""Crash"" was released. At that time he got hold of probably the best script he has laid his hands on in his prime, that book by J.G. Ballard. By putting Russians, this time, into this quintessentially Sicilian role, Cronenberg has created a kind of cartoon. In broodiness it's not much different than an average episode of the Sopranos. Once an actor starts speaking broken English with a Russian accent, he can get away with such things as downing vodka before dinner, hitting people with a bottle on the head, being overly chauvinistic, making fun of ordinary cops and murdering people. These are all markedly manly things to do, and this film is a fiesta for Viggo Mortensen and Vincent Cassel. It's always easier to speak English with an accent if one's native language is Germanic, Middle Eastern or Romance. This favors almost everyone else but Naomi Watts, who seems as lost in this multicultural mess as her crisp Australian-English delivery is anguished. This movie is definitely a men's movie. But no porn, even though there is a bit of K9 style on one occasion. But the sex is mechanic, not repeated, and the violence is... erm... rubber-necky. I never realized before that the human throat is so alike what drips down the gumtree.Mortensen has been praised for his contribution as a man who sails the sea between good and evil, but after his stint in the Peter Jackson saga ""Lord of the Rings"", what with its majestic views, grim reapers, Nordic beauties and ""80-year-old heroin addicts"", does this skill come as a surprise? He looks like he's trying to do a satisfactory Vladimir Putin impersonation in his Danish way and learning how to act again in ""normal"" movies rather than mediaeval fantasy. Indeed, when he hits the floor of realism on all four in the spa, everything about him that was so Aragorn seems to have faded away. Mortensen's job suggests that in this netherworld of brandy bottles, barber murderers and basement bonding the battle of moral and evil becomes the battle of strong vs. weak. In this fight, being strong does not exclude one from being kind in return or saving little girls from the Thames.A lot of actresses could have done a decent job of Anna's role as the nursing, meddling midwife, not by far merely Naomi Watts. The thug roles would have been harder to re-cast. What links Watts to Mortensen is the very fact that both have acted in Jackson's movies; Watts in ""King Kong"", in which her role was somehow similar, a screaming woman in the grip of something terrible and definitely stronger than herself. I saw this movie for a fiver, because it was a discount day at the cineplex, so I remarked to another person after the screening that this was just the kind of movie I wanted to see for 5 bucks: not too good but not bad in value either.

285,simonrheath,Ho-Hum Movie which Viggo Carried,6,8 September 2007,"I just attended the world premier of Eastern Promises at the Toronto Film Festival. It showed at Roy Thomson Hall which is an excellent venue and all the stars were there. Kronenberg gave an excellent speech at the beginning and cracked, ""I only came to make sure all of you attended"".Now I don't want to give anything away in this movie but there are a lot of parallels to Kronenberg's last effort - a History of Violence. But then again, all of Kronenberg's movies have some extreme violence and gore that traces back to his sci-fi/horror origins. Now I had some trouble buying into the initial premise of the movie (i.e. the death of one prostitute in London England could trigger an expose on the Russian mob) but there was one saving grace throughout the movie - the killer acting of Viggo Mortensen - this guy stole the show and made the movie. The movie is highlighted by an intense fight scene between Mortensen and two thugs that is one of the best fights I've seen in any movie.Now it was novel to do a movie on the Russian Mafia and its raquets like prostitution. It was also interesting to see the social structure of the mob and the story told by the tattoos on its foot soldiers. However, it was hard to buy into all of the parts of the movie and it didn't hold that well together - and Naiomi Watts performance was forgettable.I will have to see this movie a few more times to be sure but Kronenberg got it right the first time - History of Violence was much better.

288,Mik_Cal,A more conventional Cronenberg film but very good,8,4 May 2008,"Viggo Mortensen and an engaging plot carry this movie.In the beginning I was afraid that the dialog would remain stilted in a Cronenberg like fashion with the added element of the Russian accents and portrayal of a culture that Cronenberg is an outsider in. Gradually though the plot coalesced and started to make connections between the characters seem more real.Naomi Watts' character was not distracting though also didn't add much to the movie. I think she did an OK job with the role but I have a feeling that she was miscast, I didn't believe that she was a half-Russian Brit or an immigrant.Viggo Mortensen was really phenomenal in this one. He seems to have overcome his leading-man good looks to make his character seem like someone who spent time in Russian prisons. Armin Mueller Stahl was good though slightly less convincing as the Russian gangster.I wonder though, why Cronenberg chose not to put in sub-titles during those portions of the dialog that were in Russian. I was wondering what was being said. I understand that the Russian spoken there was quite good.",Eastern Promises
289,carlostallman,An Actor's Courage,9,27 December 2007,"I was bowled over by Viggo Mortensen's performance. I saw the film about a week ago and his eyes, his look, his smirk has been with me every day since. He is rapidly becoming my favorite actor because he makes something new, long lasting, thought provoking and totally true, out of the characters he plays, the way he plays them and I feel also, why he plays them. Here he is a Russian mobster's driver, or is he? The important thing is that you won't be able to take your eyes of him. Here he has David Cronemberg at his side / or sides, once again. Cronemberg seems to know and understand Mortensen's power. And Mortensen seems to trust him completely. Eastern Promises is a really good film with and extraordinary Viggo Mortensen at its very core. Not to be missed.",Eastern Promises

There are no other film makers out there who deserve the recognition he is finally getting. After years of making brilliant contemporary Sc-Fi films under, over and between the radar, the mainstream press has finally caught on, and the big studios have finally given this artist the backing he has needed for years.Now, ""Eastern Promises"" I felt is not superior to the previous ""A History of Violence,"" but it is STILL BETTER than most of the other drivel the major studios are shoving down the collective public gullet. It shows how beautiful the horrible can be, and (unlike the films of his more notable peers) can captivate so completely that the only real disappointment when exiting the theater is that the film is over.The real success of this film is that my only criticism is that I wanted more.",Eastern Promises
291,gcats-1,From Russia with Love,8,23 February 2008,"From the cold dark allies of London emerges the ruthless reality of Russian mobsters who in their primitive minds confuse their evil reality with their family values. Amongst their family gatherings and birthday parties for their mothers we uncover the evil they conceal so well of poor underage girls who are lured from Russia under the pretext of promises of a better life only to find themselves thrown in a septic pit of rape, prostitution and heroin addiction. Cronenberg portrays this contradiction so well. He exposes the hypocrisy from the coldness in the actors' eyes right down to the sombre violin playing. Armin Mueller-Stahl who plays the part of ruthless cold blooded murdering head of the family tells his daughters to make the wood cry as they are playing the violin. So too are the poor young girls crying that are held hostage and beaten and used as sex slaves by his son played by Vincent Cassel. Amongst the cruelty there is some salvation and retribution when one of the young girls that falls pregnant, escapes from the cruelty and leaves an incriminating diary behind that falls into the hands of a hospital nurse that assists in the birth of her baby. The birth of the baby signifies the beginning of the end for the mob boss as it gives undercover police agent played by Viggo Mortensen the opportunity he needs to get closer to the top. Mortensen is superb for the part; even his violent scenes are clinically perfect, right to his surgical and carefully planned takeover as head of the family. Altogether a superb film with great acting; Cronenberg at his usual thrilling best.",Eastern Promises
292,LeonardPine,Cronenberg delivers again,8,27 July 2008,"With 'Eastern Promises' David Cronenberg once again proves he is one of the most consistently talented directors around. I dread to think what a hash some other directors would have made of this challenging script. This is a tightly paced film, with not a single shot wasted, and as usual with Cronenberg you are left wanting more. Fans of the director will be pleased that he invests the film with his usual off-kilter reality, and it works beautifully. The London locations are used well, but it isn't the usual tourist fare we get here. Its a London uninviting and bleak which suits the story. Excellent performances right across the board help this to be a riveting 90 odd minutes, there is some silliness involving tattoos and a twist that doesn't quite work, but these are minor niggles compared to the rest of the quality on show here. Beautifully shot, especially some of the restaurant scenes, it also has a memorable sequence in a Turkish Baths that is not for the faint hearted. Once again, Cronenberg has ventured into new areas and delivered admirably. Well worth seeing.",Eastern Promises
293,hapiores,From the man of the independent circuit...,10,15 January 2008,"Always a name taken into account, David Cronenberg has changed the course of his cinematic career in the last couple of years. Being a synonym of independent visceral films dedicated to the symbiosis between flesh,machine and technology - for which he was know throughout the eighties and nineties - his last two movies seem to deviate slightly from this kind of thematic.For ""Eastern Promises"" Cronenberg chose the world of the Russian mafia and at it's center the death of a 14 year old girl when giving birth to her child leaving behind a morbid story. This is the trigger that puts Anna (Naomy Watts) in contact with the criminal underground of London. Things seem do flow subtly, showing the ambivalent relation between Wrong&wright,good&evil, as the main characters seem capable of both, with a clear judgment  make no mistake  that works 100% both ways; Through Anna we see this when she realizes that the sweet old man she's asked for help can be a vicious ""godfather"" or when she begins to become involved with Nikolay (Viggo Mortensen)a man for all jobs.It's the independent feeling that Cronnenberg's pictures always seem to acquire that gives a perfect psychological mood to the movie - similarly to ""A Histoy of Violence""- and the choice of characters and focus on a less exploited criminal ""culture"" gives a distinct personality to a story that in it's essence is nothing new. Viggo stands out with a role that perfectly adjusts to his skills, not only because of the dedication but because of the courage - just think about the scene in the bathroom; not many actors would be up to it. One final observation: the final shot with Nikolay alone with his thoughts brings to memory the ending of that old Coppola's movie .",Eastern Promises
294,Sister_Spooky,"Entertaining, but not challenging",6,27 October 2008,"Mortensen is striking in his performance as an enigmatic Russian mobster and I was thoroughly entertained, but the overall tone of the film and some key moments are inconsistent with each other. I couldn't help but chuckle when Nikolai finally finishes off the second thug in the steam room, and the climactic moment involving the infant is equally melodramatic. Furthermore, the film is not nearly as subversive as A History of Violence. Writer Steven Knight clearly intends to pose a similar question about whether violence can be justified, but I really didn't find it challenging to rationalize any of Nikolai's actions.",Eastern Promises
295,panicoma-1,Chronenberg delivers turkey to your door!,1,15 May 2009,"It happens to us all I suppose, my high-point was winning in the third round of Central Secondary Modern's ping-pong championship in 1962. It was all downhill after that. I sometimes think Cronenberg peaked with Existenze, but surely there are limits to how low you can fall? I won't waste skin tissue by typing too much if I can avoid it. Cardboard characters, stereotypes abound, joke story, bad acting (Cassel is laugh-cringe-inducing) Naomi Watts invisible, I half-expected Mrs Overall to creep in and the scenery to shake. Editing - what editing? It must have been years ago they all saw The Godfather and everyone forgot you need several ingredients in the right proportion for critical acclaim; style, pace, talent, judgement etc. The party scene (attempted rip-off of the Corleone wedding) has some bloke badly dressed as a Russian peasant singer looking like an extra in Coronation Street - I kid you not. Saving grace? None. Mortensen's performance is good, but it's as if he's acting in another, much better movie without the rest of the cast and crew being aware! Make no mistake, this movie is a catastrophe and the director doesn't deserve another chance. Do yourself a favour and compare it to REAL skill: The Lives of Others, or failing that, check out The Bill on telly, that's crap too but Eastern Promises makes it look like high Art.",Eastern Promises

Really ruined for my date and me. It was a captivating movie until that point. Actors were right on the money. Script was very good. Cinematography was well done.Viggo is making his mark and getting better with each film. I am not a Naomi Watts fan but she was actually good in this movie. Didn't overact as she typically does.

The story ends on New Year's Eve, the beginning of a new life, and now the child is clean and safe. Anna is also the name of the mother of the Virgin Mary, besides being the nurse who cares for the child of the dead ex-virgin. And England is the country where God is viewed as a female, in the collective unconscious - by the way, that is why the English people give such long lives to their queens. The movie is a story of Hope - ""Eastern Promises"", and East is the place where the sun comes from. Like so many other artists, Cronenberg has buried his Christian myths in his Unconscious, from where he now draws the images for such fantastic movies.",Eastern Promises
298,alekdavis,Genuine fake,2,7 April 2008,"I got interested in this movie after watching Oscar nominations, getting recommendations from friends, and listening to an NPR interview with Viggo Mortensen. Well, the interview was much more interesting that this parody of a movie. I struggled through the first 30-40 minutes, and then could not bring myself to watching it to the end, so whatever I say here is based only on the first part.The only good thing I can say: I liked Naomi Watt's performance; it seemed genuine. Everything else was so fake: fake villains (Russian, Turkish), fake accents, fake story... I mean this was a cartoonish performance. I guess it's what Western people assume Russian gangsters should look like, and the majority of Western viewers will probably buy this crap. Being Russian, I don't. No way. I understand that actors are not Russian, so it's a challenge, but some similar movies (OK, very few movies) manage to address the authenticity part much better (e.g. ""Little Odessa"" seemed more genuine to me). Viggo Mortensen does not look like Russian. He may be a good actor, but he cannot play a Russian (OK, his Russian is not the worst, but it's far from genuine). BTW, were Mashkov already booked? What about Mironov? Could Cronenberg give Menshikov a call? Anyway, if you are familiar with Russian culture and value authenticity in movies, you will probably be disappointed; otherwise, give it a try: a lot of people seem to like it.",Eastern Promises

As a result of incomprehensible script - really bad stains on Croneberg's, Viggo's and Naomi's track records. And, being a Russian, I was breaking into hysterical laughter every time ""authentic"" Russian element was brought in. This really tests the intelligence not just of of any Russian or expert on Russia/Russians, but also of any psychologist, any person with kids, any law enforcer and especially any person in medical profession. If intended as a Tarantino/Rodrigez-like prank - it worked! Otherwise - it is complete and utter waste, of our time and of good actors.

And some how, that is far more thrilling than him charging into brig of orcs.That is what this film is about. Violence as it is.However, you want to keep watching this film till the end because its simply beautiful. Starting with Viggo, all the characters, even the biggest villain in this film is portrayed somewhat noble. This is nothing to do with justifying their character but you will realize there is beauty in evil.If you only know Cronenberg for ""The Fly"", this film will totally changes his impression.",Eastern Promises
301,death-hilarious,Unfulfilled Promises,4,11 September 2007,"I have to admit that I was very intrigued when I heard that David Cronenberg was filming another brutal mafia drama starring Viggo Mortensen and it wasn't because I thought their last collaboration, A History of Violence, was a particularly good film. It's just that I couldn't shake the feeling that there were so many interesting ideas floating around that film just out of reach (about cultures of violence and regeneration through violence), and hoped that Cronenberg might be able to explore those ideas more satisfyingly in the follow up. Cronenberg has to me always been a director about ideas. Where other directors are obsessed with tight narrative or perfect composition, Cronenberg has never been afraid of getting messy and shaking things up a bit, especially if it means taking the audience out of its comfort zone, making them squirm a little and forcing them to think about some things that they might not want to.Going into the movie with this mindset, it's hard to overstate how disappointing Eastern Promises was. The movie consists of every mafia film cliché ever conceived, though spiced with the novelty of a Russian accent, and strung together with a narrative out of a Nancy Drew murder mystery. I can't imagine anyone creating a more generic, derivative, and 'safe' mafia movie if they tried. The only significant departure is whereas many mafia films, starting with the Godfather, exist in a world of moral ambiguity, Eastern Promises doesn't even have the courage for that. In this film the bad guys are sickeningly bad and the good guys are (just as sickeningly) good. The only sequence in the film that registers a pulse is the naked fight sequence, and even that seemed too cutely choreographed lacking any of the rawness or intensity that viewers got out of the Borat fight sequence for example. Despite having a wonderfully rich cultural tapestry to work with, Eastern Promises wears its Russian heritage as clumsily as a bad Russian accent.The film can't be seen as anything other than an attempt by Cronenberg to reach as broad an audience as possible to cash in on the critical success of A History of Violence. As a long time Hollywood outsider, maybe Cronenberg felt it was time to join the ranks of the commercially successful directors with his own 'Godfather'. Unfortunately, the world already has a Coppola, what we need is a Cronenberg.",Eastern Promises
302,emeiserloh,"Eastern Promises, Hollywood fulfillment",6,8 October 2007,"Can't get over all the people extolling the virtues of this mediocrity. I'll admit that it held my interest up through its climax in the baths, but delivered nothing thereafter. Reminiscent in some ways of The Godfather, in its portrayal of a crime family, it is also the story of a young midwife, who is drawn by circumstances into their web, and Viggo's character, who lives in the moral quagmire between them. As a crime drama, however, it ultimately suffers from having this dual focus, as much as from the incredulity surrounding both stories, their wedding, and more importantly their development. Several potentially interesting themes are introduced in the course of the film, but none of them are explored to any satisfaction (the screenwriter and/or director seems to prefer jumping from one to another and using them as props for a few stylish scenes rather than treating any of them with the respect of someone with anything interesting to say), and in the end its hard to say what the film is really about. The characters suffer from the same sketchy profiling, and while most of the performances are very good (given what the actors have to work with), compared to a film like The Godfather, the people being played are drawn too superficially to resonate afterward. The Russian mob boss is a wolf in sheep's clothing, and yet goes against his character and chooses to sacrifice his only competent soldier to protect an incompetent son who is clearly dangerous to his operation. The emotionally weak, yet vile son, meanwhile, is provided no consistent, believable persona (to use the Godfather again, he is one minute Jimmy Caan, the next John Cazale) and seems to function almost completely as a catalyst for others to play off of; a counterpoint conceived to give evidence of, or reveal something about Viggo and his father. Then, there is the midwife, who is introduced as an important character only to be dropped midway through (when Viggo takes over) until she reappears in the end with all of her problems resolved, and we are then supposed to feel her emotional journey. The entire confrontation involving the four of them down by the river struck me as lame- everybody rushing from the hospital to the dumping ground in various disturbed and damaged states to arrive at a big love-in around a baby that only midwife seems to want. What a waste of Naomi Watts. Even Viggo (who is brilliant as the film's centerpiece) has no real character to work with. Think about it: Who is this guy, really, besides a quasi-moral bad ass? Part one character from other movies, part another, is what Cronenberg's people are; insubstantial at the core.... and the same is true for his stories.Cronenberg's latest efforts (this and History Of Violence) are a weaker cross between early Lynch (Blue Velvet), and a later-day Scorcese (The Departed), and if you enjoy those kind of films, you may like Eastern Promises. Perhaps like the The Departed, it is more easily appreciated as a Hollywood style hybrid of cross-genre realism, and stylish entertainment. 3 out of 5 for the most overrated director out there. A posturing,"" cool guy,"" Cronenberg plays with and mixes Hollywood stereotypes and clichés (a la Tarantino, even Jarmush), but he doesn't always do it very well, and often to the detriment of other aspects of the film, its story, and its characters.

303,Margie24,works so well on many levels...,9,14 September 2007,"It is not often that audiences today are treated to a film that has as many things going for it as Eastern Promises does. Whether it's because of interference from studios determined to make their products as marketable as possible, filmmakers who favor style over substance, or just a plain old shortage of originality, nowadays it is a treat when a film fan can leave the theater and feel affected by the artistry that he/she has just experienced.On the surface, Eastern Promises is a straightforward crime story about people who don't appear to be terribly complex. But somehow, the combination of the narrative, the mood, and the humanness of the characters create an alchemy that transcends this film from something that could have been common into something quite unique and memorable. Noirish settings, dedicated medical professionals, and mobsters and their loyal henchmen are all commonplace enough in movies as to risk being clichés. Yet everything in this film about a London midwife who stumbles into contact with the Russian mob as she seeks clues to the identity of a teen who died in childbirth mesh together wonderfully and fully engage the viewer.While it all starts with the script, credit must be given to the director, David Cronenberg for bringing it to life, and for the cast, who created living, breathing characters who the viewer cares about- whether they are likable or not, good or evil, or not quite so easy to read. They seem real.At the core of the film is ""Nikolai,"" the loyal chauffeur to the kingpin's volatile son. ""Nikolai"" is both enigmatic and mesmerizing. We know he is a man with a past and with secrets, but we really don't know what his goals and motives are. We don't know who he is, yet somehow, just as the half-Russian midwife, ""Anna"", we are drawn to him and trust that there is goodness in him, even as were are not quite sure we should. It is a skillful, yet understated performance that quietly blows you away.Although Eastern Promises has some of the director's signature moments of eye-popping violence, they do not dominate this film and it is the quiet moments- where the characters are silently contemplating aspects of their own existence that give the film its power. We can see the introspection and pain on their faces, but the script leaves so much unsaid, and so much about the two main characters (played by Viggo Mortensen and Naomi Watts) we come to care about so much remain a beautiful, haunting mystery.",Eastern Promises
304,mattdenes,"Cronnenberg, once again, at his best",10,21 September 2007,"This movie is lush, complex and astonishingly interesting on so many levels. The acting, all around, is sometimes so meagerly subtle, especially in characters like Nikolai (Mortenson), that you almost forget that they're actors and not Russian or British or whatever. Like classic Cronnenberg, the cinematography is very direct, full of long complex takes, and pays special attention to expression through the body and face and eyes. It was, surprisingly, not as violent as i thought it would be, though the blood, when it did appear, flowed and flowed. Suspense grabs, holds tight and never lets you go in this almost entirely noirish thriller that teeters on the conflict between self indulgent gain, and what is real, what is given, and what is ultimately understood by all even at man's most deepened core. The story requires attention to details and a steady ear to language, both verbal, and, as stated earlier, physical. The action, when it does occur, which at times is from nowhere, either comes and goes without the stylistic, but brutal reality of what would probably occur if what was happening on the screen was actually going on. Like his recent work of art, A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, the flow of the red ruby happens in bloody, dirty, nasty, unorganized, realistic fashion that may, for a split second, take your breath away to marvel upon what just happened before you. Mind games aplenty and overally good film-making give this film noteriety well-deserved for many years to come. 10/10",Eastern Promises
305,myrealnameisjon,Unkept promises,5,6 May 2008,"Eastern Promises fails to keeps its promises. Aside from Naomi Watts' innate inability to pass off a believable roll, the movie develops at a snail's pace. I cannot make the declaration that it is the worst mafia movie ever made, but it is certainly my least favorite of any major production crime films. I have to say that I was disappointed in the film for the sake of taking one of the most fearsome groups of people in the world and pacifying them in a slow moving and poorly performed film. Even the cinematography was straight line and gave no room for vision. It felt as though it was filmed between the Leave it to Beaver and Bates Motel exhibits of Universal studios, so it had to stay within a limited scope of buildings that somewhat resembled London. In addition to physical limits, the script allows for intricate relationships between good and evil, but left all of the characters without true development. The true eyes of Viggo Mortensen's Nikolai were revealed within the most predictable of tales, and far too late in the film. Any intensity that could have been had in the potential character development of the rugged gangster was lost between the revelation and the end of the film that seemed to come only moments later. By the time the story got moving, it ended abruptly and brought no true resolution other than an emotional hug and a big question mark as to the purpose of it all. In light of the negative, Viggo Mortensen continues to prove that he is living phenomena in the world of film. Mortensen was the only saving graces in a film that was being quickly destroyed by Watts and Cassel.",Eastern Promises
306,Islandeye,"Mediocre, Well-performed, Unexciting: Eastern Promises",6,21 July 2008,"By the first 15 minutes of David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises, there's already been a fair-share of bloodshed. A Russian mobster has his throat slit in a barber's chair, a young prostitute haemorrhages during childbirth, and the baby is covered in the blood of her mother, now dead leaving only the baby and a diary behind. With all this potential and diversity in story shown in such a short time, it is disappointing that apart from the extreme scenes of violence, Eastern Promises fails to provoke any sort of reaction.Eastern Promises features the real-life Vory V Zakone, an underground Russian gang, helmed by Semyon, a softly spoken and ruthless old mobster played by Armin Mueller Stahl. His son, Kirill, played by Vincent Kassel and their driver Nikolai, played by Viggo Mortensen (who featured in Cronenberg's structurally messy A History of Violence) all revolve around a plot to stop Anna, a midwife who finds the diary, incriminating the gang members in several sex-trafficking related crimes. The problem with all this is that the intention is to explore the way-of-life of these gangsters from the outside, but this doesn't happen because the gang is never fully mapped out. They never commit any crimes. They seem to have only one building at their disposal. There only seems to be about 5 members. I never felt the full force of their power like I did for the wise-guys in Goodfellas. The violence does show the extreme behaviour that naturally exudes from living this kind of life, but even then they only seem to go after each other. Even the mysterious higher-up leaders don't provide more detail, simply showing up from hidden sources of power and strength that we aren't privy to  I was disappointed at the end at how little we learnt about how the Russian mob operated, they seemed more like a failing business than a controlling, intimidating crime-squad. Cronenberg also fails to give London the same kind of black, pulsing heart of the L.A in Heat, or the New York of Goodfellas  Further making the film feel more artificial, like it isn't taking place in anywhere in reality.Viggo Mortensen's is a rare case of a deserved Oscar nomination for his embodiment of the role. The accent is pitch-perfect, the mannerisms and style all collecting to create his character. His personality is never really exposed, never beyond much more than downplayed intelligence and natural charm. He always seems like both an outsider and an adamant insider, his moral compass swinging around throughout the film and never landing squarely on a single spot. Even when the film itself is mediocre and plodding, he is always fascinating to watch, never knowing when his character may evolve into something we haven't yet been shown.The ending of Eastern Promises somewhat lends itself to a possible sequel  Which I doubt will ever take place, though part of me wishes would. I felt like I'd only been shown a glimpse, then torn away from the deepest, darkest corners of the Russian crime-world  The characters and their dynamics are interesting to watch, but even that and Viggo Mortensen's commanding screen presence didn't fully make up for the lack of depth or detail in the films narrative and focus point. For a film that I was never bored to watch I was surprised at how little I got out of it.",Eastern Promises
307,thornswrath,Eastern Promises Delivers,10,12 October 2007,"Wow, what a movie! Eastern Promises, in contrast to its predecessor, manages to make A History Of Violence look like the comic book story it actually was. With his latest foray into gangster styled violence and bloodshed, Cronenberg makes painstaking efforts to have the material come across as realistically as possible.Whereas AHOV was an idealized fable highlighting the symbolic aspects of how violence affects the nuclear unit in America, Eastern Promises does nearly a 180 degree turnabout to showcase as realistically as possible how an underground mob's legacy is built, supported, and inevitably, as any model of corrupt civilization must do, how it falls; or rather, how it evolves and is passed on to the next generation. Compared to AHOV, there is only a fraction of stylization in this movie - that is, symbolic subtext. To let you in on what that is exactly would amount to a rotten spoiler, so I won't get into that aspect of it. Leave it said that this is a far grittier, bloodier, and more realistic account of events than AHOV, by a long shot.Viggo Mortensen is perfectly cast in the role of Nikolai. He brings a very tight and focused performance to the big screen that is destined to heap even more accolades upon him. Here is a leading man sure to scramble to the top of the heap in a day when there is no shortage of leading men: Russell Crowe, Clive Owen, Edward Norton, Leonardo DiCaprio, Ryan Gosling, Robert Downey Jr, Benicio Del Toro, Christian Bale, Robert Deniro, Samuel Jackson, Joaquin Phoenix, Ralph Fiennes, Jeff Bridges, Morgan Freeman, Geoffrey Rush, Brad Pitt . . . Viggo could win a staring contest with any one of these powerhouse actors.Naomi Watts may sort of come across as a one trick pony to some, I mean, it seems as if she plays practically the same role in every movie she's in; but somehow she's got that down pat, and always comes across very likable and convincing, regardless of the movie she's in. Maybe I'm biased because she's incredibly attractive, but once again she turns in a solid performance as Anna, a midwife whose mundane life is injected with danger as she begins investigating a teenager who dies during childbirth in the hospital Anna works at.Despite its select moments of overt violence, what lends this movie its power is actually its understatements and subtleties. This makes for a nice contrast, lending the film a very finely honed tone.I personally thought the most amazing performance in the movie went to Armin Mueller-Stahl, who portrayed the elder father of this Russian mob family. What made this performance all the more impressive is how it never once became overstated. Just a glimmer in his eye held enough portent of impending threat to give his character as much chilling weight as any classic Godfather figure from movies in the past; i.e, Mueller-Stahl did not need a bloodied baseball bat, a Mac-10 nor even a single moment of violence to carry across the message that he was not someone to mess with. It was this sort of realism which lent Eastern Promises more weight than your typical ""Goodfella's""-type scene, wherein a stylized mobster flexes his power in a sudden burst of physical violence; all Armin Mueller-Stahl had to do was look at you with his grandfatherly mask to get you thinking twice about how to handle him. Some of the movie's most effective moments can be attributed to him, while he spoke and behaved in the most grandfatherly of ways.All in all I'd have to say Eastern Promises is as solid an adult- themed movie as any thoughtful audience member could wish for. And as always, Cronenberg is masterful in his implementation of cinematography and guiding the actors to create a striking motion picture that truly resonates long after the curtains close.Be warned, however: Eastern Promises' sequences of violence get pretty gruesome and realistic. I'd even go so far as to suggest the infamous steam room scene may just be eligible for the most realistically staged and bloodiest fight in movie history; definitely not for the squeamish. However, that said, Eastern Promises ends up being surprising for its lack of typical violent-fare, i.e, no dumb car chases, no idiotic gun fights, and no predictable outbursts of typical violence: just pure and realistic mob affairs set to Howard Shore's suitable musical score, and a cast of actors in top notch form.Watch the Oscars for Eastern Promises, my prediction is that it will have earned its share.",Eastern Promises

OK, people, can somebody tell me why this movie has a 7.7 rating here + nominations and wins?Anyone who sees any good in Viggo's performance here obviously haven't seen Daniel Day Lewis in My left foot or Martin Freeman in Sherlock's 3-4 season and other great actors of our time.Anyone who feels the movie has anything close to a Story - let me ask: isn't it apparent from the get-go who is who and how the story is going to evolve? And if you, like me, saw every single turn of it coming - is it really a good screenplay?And, lets not forget that the movie has an abrupt ending, not even giving a steady composition. The only good thing about it is it's flow, which really is nice and you can watch it in one single take, very nicely cut and leading you from one scene to another. Leading to what? To a zero, because we are left with no real ending. Was there a second part in plans? I dont care to know.Part 2.
But like that's not enough - there's more. Let me tell you a secret now. Every single thing you see in a movie that is ""Russian"" - just isn't. OK, the names are.Initially I was watching it wondering why not take Russian actors, who, just like in any country, exist, some of them incredible, some not so much, some are, but in no way they would act any worse than non-Russian actors, yet they would not be speaking in broken Russian for one third of a movie and then in a broken Russian accent for the other two thirds.Soon enough I stopped wondering that, because when one sees how every single detail is garbled - every cultural aspect they show just does not exist or exist in another culture - one kind of stops asking questions.No Russians call each other by the name + fathers name, never ask for the father's name when first meeting, and never would give it with a straight face, because it's just plain weird. That structure is left solely for the legal institutions and for school teachers and big bosses, and is never used in private conversations, except ironically - so watching ""heartfelt"" Anna Stepanovna makes anyone familiar with the culture wince. It's like meeting a Spaniard and making them tell you all of their last names as a sign of respect and special cuddle, if you know what I mean.
Not a single tattoo shown except one on the back has any meaning in Russian criminal world and no rituals like what you see exist or ever existed.
Borscht is a Ukrainian dish, it is indeed eaten in Russia - just as Miso and Tom Kha are, but it is by no means a significant part of Russian cuisine and is also never cooked the way it is shown in the movie, nor eaten without the sour cream.
Playing violin is usually considered to be a Jewish ""thing"" in Russia.
I could go on and on, the movie is literally full of it. But I think I have vented my feelings more or less already, so...If you're going to watch ""Eastern promises"" - do not for a moment take what they show as Russian culture seriously.",Eastern Promises
309,bigeyesforbeauty,annoying,1,22 January 2008,"This movie would be OK, if one considers it a B rated genre piece of action, but the problem with it is that it is so pretentious and presents itself as some kind of realistic mafia/gangster movie at the same time lacking any sense of depth or any entertaining value. Cronenberg has his own recognizable style of making movies and it's visible in this one, and it saves a movie a little bit. I mean if you take it as some kinda Kill Bill with a bunch of bad guys and a bit of ethnic flavor it's OK, although still nothing much to talk about since the story line is so generic and flat one has to be a naive and impressionable teenager to be entertained by it.The problem starts if one takes the movie seriously as some kind of gangster drama or as some kind of glance into the world of real Russian mafia. Then, the whole thing falls apart right from the beginning. For someone who grew up in Russia and had any remote contacts with gangsters the mafia portrayed in this piece of fantasy is no more realistic as the orcs in the Lord of the Rings. First of all, no organized crime group would call themselves ""vory v zakone"". It's plain ridiculous. Then, the whole switching of languages thing looks really schizophrenic. You constantly see the ""Russian"" gangsters exchanging phrases in some kinda pidgin Russian and then repeating the same thing to each other in English. It's just ludicrous as well as the words they say in Russian are so out of otuch with what the real Russians might say in the relevant situation. It's hard to believe that in a movie with such a budget they couldn't hire some Russians to do the work. Cassel in fact was the only one whose accent remotely reminded meRussian. The worst came from Mortensen who despite claiming to visitRussia and practice for the role inside the country totally fails to look anything close to what a Russian man would look and sound. Then, the way they execute each other and all these ""Chechens"" with little knives is again so remote from reality. In real world they just shoot the victims early in the morning while they are going out of the house and not run after them in the public sauna armed with tiny knives. The God fathers gathering to admit the new member is again director's fantasy. In real world none of them busy people would bother to come together in order to hire a little man. In real world a mafia newcomer would never have chance to talk to all the bosses at once. Then, I had an impression that the fearsome criminal organization where Viggo infiltrated himself consists of only the father, his son Cyill and him, nobody else. I could go on and on about all the mismatches but I guess the realism wasn't the driving force behind the making of the movie, so let it be what it is- a stylized B rated piece of mafia-fantasy.",Eastern Promises
310,Easi,Wonderful depiction of human beings,9,22 January 2008,"Friends told me it was a good and violent movie. It's not just a good movie, it's a wonderful one. And apart from the sporadic and ""really"" violent sequences (assasinations, rape) the calm moments are as precious. Seen from outside we will never comprehend all the aspects of organized crime. All the values, all the rites, all the violence, all the unwritten laws, all the logic who goes beyond the criminal activity itself. Good for us there are writers, actors, directors who tell us some of these aspects. The story is not the most important thing here. It's the carrier for the depiction of the characters. I loved the acting. All of them. The mysterious Nikolai (Mortensen) with his enigmatic look of sadness. The chaotic and somehow crazy Kiril (Cassel), always searching for his fathers recognition and suffering like a child for that. The ""grandpa"" Semyon (Müller-Stahl), being the goodhearted, comprehending helper in one moment and the next the ruthless, not caring ""cancer"" of the society. The splendid Anna (Watts) so confused and innocent but still willing to enter the world of crime and violence and risking it all for wanting to do the ""right"" thing. All characters have fears. All these fears are so different but the same as well. You see them written in their faces during the whole film. Time flies bye... but you need some guts to see this unveiled world which Cronenberg is showing us here.",Eastern Promises

313,andrewpotter1-1,Eastern Promises review,7,12 June 2008,"This film is very hard to describe so I guess I will start out by saying that I DID like it A LOT! This movie begins with a man in a barbershop getting his throat slit open. (Anyone else thinking they should have burst into song and dance while making meat pies?) The next scene involves a girl (who looks no older than 14 but you know what they can do with make up these days) going into a prescription store asking for help. She then proceeds to bleed from her... um place, leading the audience to believe that she is having a baby. She is taken to a hospital (where her nurse is none other than the fabulous Naomi Watts). The baby survives, the girl does not. This all happens within the first 10 minutes of the movie. 3 words to describe this movie: Violence, Blood, and Nudity. If any of these make you uncomfortable then I do NOT suggest seeing this. The storyline involves young girls being raped and being forced to take drugs (none of it is shown thank God) There are three major plot twists that I will not spoil, but the main gist of the movie is (are you ready for this?) NO ONE CAN BE TRUSTED! If you like Russian mob movies, interesting plots, or Viggo Mortensen's ""talent"". Then I STRONGLY recommend this movie. It's not made for everyone but it does have one mainstream friendly trait: Viggo Mortensen. This guy ROCKS this movie (how on God's green earth was he beaten by Daniel- Day Lewis?) Naomi Watts also gives an incredible performance. The movie moves kind of slow, but I really like movies like that, and it speeds up and becomes real intense in the last 10 minutes. All in all I give this film a 7/10 stars.",Eastern Promises
314,vikasthegunner,Invigorating,9,9 June 2009,"With Eastern Promises, Director David Cronenberg has brought us something very unique. This Crime Drama stands out from its counterparts because of two reasons, the first one being that it does not involve any drug deals gone wrong or a police-mobsters saga and the second reason being Viggo Mortensen. Viggo Mortensen's role in this movie is inspiring. One might say that Mortensen carries the movie on his back but in all fairness the movie has got a thought provoking storyline. Naomi Watts put up a wonderful performance too. In a nutshell, the story is good, the characters feel alive, the actors are well chosen for the role and the movie is gripping. Its a shame that Mortensen missed out on the Oscar but undeniably it is one of his greatest performances ever. Armin Mueller-Stahl and Vincent Cassel get a special mention.If you like watching crime movies, don't miss this one.",Eastern Promises
315,CremeFraiche,Good but not as surprising as History of violence,7,16 September 2007,"As an introduction, I am a demanding audience , especially when it comes to my TOP 5 directors. Eastern Promises is actually a very entertaining movie .The acting is excellent. Mortensen and Watts are solid and reliable leads, they dun-not disappoint. It is time they get awards. The supporting roles are even sharper. Cassel is amazing. He has been type-casted into the mean French guy he plays very well in American movies. Here he shows the range and vulnerability he has displayed in French movies. Which makes him the best French actor of his generation.So why was I disappointed? Basically because this movie is following History of Violence and it is a little bit too similar and not as well made. The Mob theme , the violence, Viggo as the ambiguous man , the tough yet fragile blond woman...Then, there is a little bit of humor/irony in Eastern Promises, here and there, yet it is missing the typical Cronenberg dark humor. In History of Violence, the scene with William Hurt was really great for that.But what really frustrated me is that the suspense was totally dead when there was a big reveal 25 minutes before the end or so. Then I was almost bored. And I did not need all the loose ends to be tied up.In the end, I miss the visionary and daring Cronenberg . Crash is not an easy movie to watch but it is weird and dark and shocking. Existenz is a visionary movie as well as several of his earlier ones. Spider is a very good movie about mental illness. History of Violence was a great novelty for him . But doing it again and so soon after? Why? Go see it though. Again it is a very entertaining movie . And ...Viggo is naked , a lot. Smeared in blood but remember, it is fake! Actually I was laughing by the end of this very violent scene because it was really over the top , thus too funny.",Eastern Promises
316,pikhal020,"""This isn't our worldwe are ordinary people""",8,12 October 2007,"David Cronenberg has always delivered horror films that packed an intellectual punch on top of their visceral thrills. With Eastern Promises, like A History of Violence, he continues to move away from the trademark style of Videodrome, The Fly and The Dead Zone to a much more subtle but no less unsettling tone and content. His thematic concern about the nature of shifting identities is still there. Ostensibly, this movie's plot concerns Naomi Watts quest to find out the circumstances behind the death of a mysterious young woman. This leads her to a Russian crime family led by a silver haired patriarch, a brilliantly disquieting performance from Mueller-Stahl. Cassel turns in a manic and impressive role as the borderline insane and impulsive son and heir to the crime family throne. But it is Mortenson's Nikolai that is the most mysterious and complex character, truly one of the most enigmatic characters put to screen in the last few years. Echoing Nikolai, the movie's atmosphere oozes mystery and a constant dread of the awful secrets lurking in the shadowy underworld of London. ""This isn't our worldwe are ordinary people"" warns Sinead Cusack's character. This is not a typical crime flick; its more of an exploration of the inner motivations of its conflicted characters than the mechanics of the mob world. But Cronenberg does not shy away from graphically depicting the violence of this shadowy world, including an incredible scene set in a bath house that definitely raises the bar. This movie is a fresh and original neo-noir from beginning to end. On top of the brilliant performances and direction, the screenplay by Knight (Dirty Pretty Things) is full of twists and revelations, and Howard Shore's understated score effectively accentuates the proceedings. With Cronenberg, it always feels like there is so much more going on than just what's on the screen, and multiple viewings are always rewarded.",Eastern Promises
317,eksellentz,Overall good movie.,7,6 January 2008,"Overall Cronenberg delivers a good package, with quite OK story-line, good acting (as you would expect from likes of Mortensen, Cassel, Watts and others). But once again - what can you expect from a western director making a movie about Russians - huge misses and misinterpretations, not to say once again they fail to cast SOME RUSSIANS to play Russians. I don't say that main characters must be Russians, but at least second line characters could be played by Russians, right? It's not like it's a problem to find credible Russian speaking people in UK or US or Canada, right? Hire some actors from Russia, for Christ sake! Besides that - right away I've noticed some terrible misinterpretations in the film: 1) ""Вор в законе"" (Vor v zakone) - is probably closest translated as ""legal thief"", meaning that one is above the law and such. It's a status that can be achieved, when the criminal elite recognizes one's ... let's say ""achievements"" in the criminal world. ""Vory v zakone"" is NOT a gang nor a criminal organization!!! It's merely s STATUS, similar to status of a ""Family member"" in the Cosa Nostra in US or other criminal organizations worldwide...2) No self respecting Russian - especially the one in the position of Semyon, the head of the criminal family - he would NEVER let his children nor his grandchildren to play violin for the amusement of his guests! That would be presenting him as a jerk, a laughable figure. Violin is played at parties by hired gypsy entertainers. Violin is also played at Jewish parties, Russians on the other hand traditionally use harmonica! Considering this fact, that makes me wonder - if the criminal family, portrayed in the movie is in fact a criminal family of Russian Jews?..These two misses were HUGE! Because of them the movie is less believable, and that's sad, this movie really had potential for being more or less accurate.",Eastern Promises

Or you have to be incredibly generous to sit through and suffer the excruciatingly simple characters.Viggo was quite good and it was his performance that got me from the 30 minute mark all the way to the 45 minute mark, before I couldn't stand it anymore and had to turn it off.The English mother and daughter were bullet in the head material, but there was slim chance the director was going to do you that favour.The Godfather character was just that, a two dimensional cliché right from the outset.The dialogue was pathetic, although the exchanges in Russian didn't bother me at all, probably because it offered relief from having to listen to idiocy in English.In the end I had to turn it off, it was ridiculous.",Eastern Promises
319,pacifist_parsi,"Eastern Promises (2007, UK/Canadian)",8,6 August 2011,"Overall, Eastern Promises felt like a practice run for A History of Violence. Many of the same themes are explored, but not with the depth seen in Violence. One thing in particular really bugged me about Eastern, and ended up impacting my feelings about the movie as a whole. At the end of Violence Cronenberg treats the audience to a view of the normal American family sitting down to dinner. Everything looks perfect, but if you've sat through the entire film, you know that this is just a veneer for the ugliness underneath. It's a great moment, and one that he can't recapture (or doesn't choose to) in Eastern.The last scenes of Eastern strive for a similar family structure. At the water's edge, right after tipping the balance of power and rescuing the baby at the center of the film's conflict, Nikkolai (Viggo Mortensen) and Anna (Naomi Watts) share a kiss, the baby held closely between them. It's another perfect picture of family unity, but here, with the reveal that Nikkolai's character is more good guy than bad, it feels like a suture, like a triumph, and not the hollow victory at the end of Violence.What's really problematic is what comes after. Anna has apparently taken the baby in as Nikkolai returns to the Russian underworld to destroy it from within. They are separate, but the illusion of the perfect family remains. Anna raises the baby with the help of the older generation – her English mother and Russian uncle – and all is sweetness and light. Too much so, I thought, as the whole thing is skewed so gender-normative that it doesn't gel with the rest of the film, and particularly with Anna's character. Throughout the movie, Anna has been the tough broad – unafraid to challenge men, riding the streets of London on her father's motorcycle, and dressed in denim and leather when she's not wearing her work scrubs. True, she is a midwife, and she has lost both a baby and a fiancé, but there is nothing about Anna's character that demonstrates this late show of femininity. In that final scene, Anna is dressed in a light-colored sun dress patterned with flowers, and she takes the baby out into a sunny courtyard to play. That single kiss with Nikkolai has changed her, rendered her softer – I missed the ass-kicking Anna of the movie, and didn't feel that this motherly, wifely figure was any sort of real replacement.I found it somewhat odd that Cronenberg made this choice – his use of the wife in Violence was nowhere near as simple, and I can't recall another female figure of his who has been reduced in this way. In general, I enjoyed the bulk of Eastern - the performances are strong (particularly the magnificent Armin Mueller-Stahl), and the whole thing rips along at a great pace. The fact that it lacks the depth of Violence doesn't render it any less enjoyable, but the easy out at the end certainly does. ALI KOHAN FOROTAGHE",Eastern Promises
320,eldapeeze,boring,1,25 December 2007,"I have to say that I'm a hugh Cronnenberg fan. Loved his early movies like the Brood, The Fly, Scanners etc, but I have to say this is one of the most boring movies I've seen. I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this. It was slow, the plot was pointless. The only action scene is when Viggo Mortensen takes on two guys at once while completely naked. The first hour was slow and it was hard for me to keep my focus. I love cronnenberg, but don't waste your time on this one. It's not for everybody. Especially not hardcore Cronneberg fans like me.

I've seen almost every Cronenberg movie from Shivers up to A History Of Violence and enjoyed them all on various levels from WOW to ""What the heck was that?"".My wife never engaged with any of the characters and after fifteen minutes was asking ""What's next?"". I stayed with it for an hour before I gave up. The characters seemed wooden and never got into their parts, like my wife I felt no connection to them, the Russian accents were really bad mixed with mumbling in Russian, and the actors felt like they were just ""doing the script"" with no life or engagement.I really want to like the movie because of the director but this time I just can't do it - I was so bored I can;t even relate the plot, if there was one.",Eastern Promises
322,The_Double-Thinker,Eastern Letdowns,4,1 October 2007,"In hopes that Eastern Promises would be the first great movie of the fall season I walked into the theater with a smile on face. I left the theater shaking my head. I should have known better than to get my hopes up. The movie brings nothing new to the table plot wise or otherwise. Naomi Watts is a midwife who has a fourteen-year old girl die on her shift, leaving only a diary and a motherless baby. Watts finds a business card of a restaurant tucked in between the pages on the diary. She takes the diary to the restaurant to get it translated. The owner greets her and offers to translate the diary in exchange for it. The restaurant owner just happens to be the ruthless head of the Russian crime syndicate in London (The setting is trivial since all of two people speak in anything but a Russian accent). It is a genre film, plain and simple. So the mob was Russian, so what? Viggo Mortenson plays Nikolai, a driver for the mob looking to move up in the organization. He is the one positive aspect of the film. Mortenson plays a character with few lines but who commands your attention throughout. He is likable, even when he is stabbing men through the eye. Which bring us to the gore. When a movie this sick and depraved has nothing to say it is simply a waste of time. Director David Cronenberg brings his signature violence back to the screen. It is less violent than his previous effort, A History of Violence, and much less gory than his horror movies of old. That doesn't mean no blood is spilled. It is, in excess. There is nothing new here in terms of brutality, but the way Cronenberg handles the violence suggests some sort of sick pleasure. The camera lingers on slit throats and severed limbs for longer than tolerable, as is evident from the near constant moans of the audience.With the amount of violence in the film, one would hope that there is some message, or at least some originality. Even a purpose would be nice. No on all counts. The movie feels contrived (especially a romance between Mortenson and Watts). It is just another gangster film, with a story that lacks originality and a director that takes pleasure in mutilation.Avoid Eastern Promises if you have any choice.",Eastern Promises
323,sohrabi70,Eastern promises- what a promise!,7,8 October 2007,"When I went in to see this film it was with mixed feelings. I love good movies surrounding organized crime, like classics: The Godfather, Scarface. But the last really good one I've seen was 12 years ago with Casino, that time with Robert De Niro. So because of this I did not want to get my hopes up for this one. I mean Viggo Mortensen as an Russian mob? I couldn't see that for me, but now- I soooo definitely can! The story is about a crime family in London. When most movies of this kind concentrates about the drug side of the mafia, this one does not. It's rather about trafficking and the animal side of some people out there. I don't want to say more as I don't want to ruin the experience.The most pleasant surprise for me was Viggo Mortensen, man did he convince me with his character! He was outstanding in this movie, and deserves all the praise he can get! Namoi Watts is good, but that is also how far I will go there. It's also some scenes in the movie that just blows you away, specially one fighting scene that is so unusual and looks real.It has it's flaws, and I'm not gonna stand here and say it's as good as Godfather or Scarface (for me taste), but it's definitely the best mafia film (Departed set aside) since Casino.This movie will make you think.

324,IrisGoeth,"old Cronenberg, revisited",9,3 October 2009,"I kind of miss the old Cronenberg, who I think was more himself, everywhere. BUT for those who complain of gratuitous violence in this movie: THAT'S Cronenberg. His movies are violent, chilling and gory. They're immensely bleak and have no mercy. In Eastern Promises you're actually watching a ""civilized"" version of David Cronenberg's work. Besides, the violence is so masterfully depicted that it's beautiful (and horrifying, at it should be) to watch.The acting here is superb. I think the movie could have done without the Naomi/Anna & Viggo/Nikolai ""love"" storyline, which I thought was banal and added nothing, but it looks like I'm alone in this. In any case, for me the ""love story"" here is between Nikolai and the capo's son Kirill (Vincent Cassel). The latter is loud, hystrionic even, and eager to prove he's not what his father thinks he is. But his repressed homosexuality is blatant and his silent disapproval of the father's way is quite apparent at times, and of course Nikolai is fully aware of both things. Kirill is a tormented individual and very lonely, looking for genuine affection in his father and finding none. He is also a man hopelessly in love with someone (Nikolai) who would probably only fully reciprocate to serve his own interests and who benefits from his sexual and emotional isolation. Cassel's performance is simply perfect. I would even rate him slightly above Viggo Mortensen, who excels all the time (IMO he's a vastly underrated actor). Kirill's underlying tenderness and excruciating longing come to the surface for some very brief moments when Nikolai has a caring, intimate gesture or word and then, ashamed or panicked, he retreats to a wannabe-machista-thug attitude again. It's fascinating to watch.On second thoughts, the character Naomi Watts plays may be helping in providing a contrast. She's someone who cares for people, who works to save lives and who would never cross a line between good and evil. On the other hand, also by way of contrast, Nikolai won't let his feelings for her or his sexual attraction to her ruin his career to the top (and I think his telling her to stay away from him is as much out of concern for her as mere self-interest), while Kirill can't help but feel and want and suffer. Nikolai will also stay loyal to Cassel's character, but is it because he loves him (as a friend or otherwise) or only because it suits his interests and he's easy to manipulate? He's a clever, calculating guy and a survivor. He won't cross certain lines, but he'll have no problem crossing most.Did I say I miss the old Cronenberg? As a matter of fact, one of his most recurring themes is here. Deviant/subversive sexuality (a loving gay man in the Russian mafia: it can't get more subversive than that). And there's also the disfiguration, the violence and the shocking moments. This is old weird Cronenberg, upgraded and updated.",Eastern Promises

Naomi Watts was wonderful as well portraying a concerned nurse unknowingly digging into a waking nightmare until it was too late and Vince Cassel as the distraught criminal trying to hide his humanity. The tone is overbearingly ominous, the violence is visceral and the tale told is truly tragic, but it draws you in further with every moment. There are some strong similarities to the likes of other dower mafia movies, such as Road to Perdition, but this film delves into one of the most interesting and terrifying criminal organizations still active today with the Russian mob, also known as the Bratva, or Brotherhood. Cronenberg brings a dangerous criminal syndicate's daily dirty deeds to life in such a way that you can feel the muck flying from the screen. This is by no means a movie for the faint of heart, or stomach strength, but it is a cinematic classic nonetheless.

Naomi Watts is also good in this film, her English accent is perfectly fine, and she plays the role well, but it wasn't anything special. The rest of the cast including Vincent Cassell are fine, no poor performances in this one. It's very realistic, no Hollywood nonsense, it portrays Russians very well in that they enjoy vodka and girls. Also gives an insight into the lives of people most of us either don't think exist or just don't don't want to know about.

Even the poster with little and index finger straighter then the rest, it all breathers authenticity.I didn't go in expecting non-Russian actors to suddenly have no accent, but I did have hesitations about the pronunciation, that usually tends to be horrible. Not so here, despite the accent (that was slight), the intonation, the way the characters cary themselves especially Mortinssen's are very Russian. (Even his less then perfect English sounds Russia when he misses articles: ""Not good place for girl to grow up."") Overall the director shows a bit of what a real SinCity looks like. Violence is like a snap of a whip, sudden and loud. The movie is very stylish, but without trying to be so. It's just how these people like to live their lifes. A lot has been said about acting and it is true Mortinssen really delivers. All the auther actors are great too though, there is no weak link in this movie.Anyway the bottom line: The most authentic movie about Russian mobsters that the west has produced so far. Furthermore I find the only aspect in which it looses to the Godfather is scope. Although the movie is complete I can not help, but to want for more. The best film I've seen this year.",Eastern Promises
331,chesneytim,Surprisingly good,8,2 March 2011,"Caught this last night, missed it first time around: Viggo Mortensen holds this together well as the rising Ukrainian in London with a dodgy and impenetrable past and a penchant for blonde nurses and Russian motorbikes (cue Naomi Watts in a straightforward role). Nasty Russians in Lonsdon would have been too easy to overdo but Cronenburg has got it just right: Vincent Cassell's velocity of thought and action is scary, and his father, played brilliantly, as the lead Russian, is masterful. The melodrama of the crimes themselves is kept wisely to the background and the focus is on how one small incident - a 14 year old girl collapsing and then dying, pregnant with multiple needle-marks in her arms, can have a myriad of unforeseen and potentially catastrophic consequences, especially for the innocents caught up in the underworld. Mortensen is the star of this for sure: assured, even when naked and fighting, he is very likable despite his chosen path...and his excuse, that he is just the driver, is as dark as you can get. Well worth a spin: this is a good movie and well deserves an 8.",Eastern Promises

The plot is very predictable (at least for me), and not very realistic. I know, this is not a documentary, but I like a little realism at least, in this type of movies. When Ana goes to the Russian mobs...it just looks very naive and annoys me. Then, her faith in the Driver (Vigo), is just annoying. He's a killer, for God's sake! Of course, they managed to put a ""forced"" and unnatural love story in a movie with some ugly killing scenes. Come on! As I sad, it is watchable, but instantly forgettable, there is nothing to talk about after it finished, and you're glad that it's not 2 hours long.",Eastern Promises
333,LordVader-10,Best Movie of 2007,10,12 March 2008,"""Eastern Promises"" is quite simply, a crime masterpiece. This, in my humble opinion, is the best gangster film since ""Goodfellas"". What? It wasn't? Than what is? ""Casino""? Good, but not great. ""The Departed""? Average. ""Eastern Promises"" is way better than both films Why do you ask? One word: Character. The acting in this film is SUPERB. Viggo Mortensen gives the best performance of his career as brutal mafia enforcer Nikolai Luhzin. Other great performances include those of Vincent Cassel (Second only to Mortensen) and Armin Muelher-Stahl. The characters are actually very interesting and all the dialogue is very believable. Most lines are great and somewhat haunting in their own Russian style (""Stay away from people like me""). Some are just plain funny (""He used to be my enemy, now he's f--king ice cream!"").The only problem with this movie was a kind of dumb twist at the end, which i won't reveal. Other than that, the whole film is virtually perfect. Great acting, great directing, terrific screenplay, and such a brutal and realistic view of organized crime and Russian culture that it is uncanny.The best film of 2007, it was a shame it wasn't nominated for best picture. Rent it now",Eastern Promises

Solided structured, with higher performances that give life to these beings tormented by the lives they must lead by obligation, justly deserves all the awards and nominations received. With the typical graphic violence inherited from the past but states that it is not suitable for everyone, and it is thanks to this realism that we have one of the best fight sequences I have seen in a long time.In these days when there is little to do and nothing in cinemas, the penalty is worth much to stay at home reclining a Sunday afternoon watching a movie like this.",Eastern Promises

Watts delivers a unforgettable role, along with Casell and Stahl. With a Godfather feel to the film. Eastern Promises overthrows gangster epic The Departed and was a lot better than American Gangster. A movie that should of been Oscar Worthy. And personally speaking the best Gangster Film since Scorsese's Goodfellas.Who ever is a fan of the genre should give Eastern Promises a try. A gangster film with this quality come's once a few years. Croenberg did a very good job showing the audience the realistic look on Russian Mob life. Also Vincent Cassel performance resembles Joe Pesci in Goodfellas, he plays a crazy gangster who's father is the boss of the family. Eastern Promise's promises a great story and a great movie.",Eastern Promises
338,whitey-98,Great movie! Great director,8,30 October 2007,"Like he did in a History of Violence, Cronenberg transcends the genre of crime/gangster movies in Eatern Promises. This movie has great performances all around. When I first saw a preview of this movie I didn't know if I could see Viggo Mortensen in this role, but he was outstanding, as was Naomi Watts's performance. I must say it was refreshing to see and hear Naomi act in her real accent. This movie is a disturbing and brutal look into the Russian mob life straight from the mind of Cronenberg. It has one of the best fight scenes I have seen in a movie in some time. What makes this movie great is that its not your typical shoot em up mob/gangster movie. Cronenberg presents these characters in a way that makes them more personable, which is Cronenberg at his best. Cronenberg deserves an Oscar nomination for this and so does Viggo, and Naomi. All I have to say is Great movie! Great director!",Eastern Promises
339,carl_wernicke,Promising but...,6,2 April 2008,"Though the film was quite good, I expected a lot more..It is a film with little character development and poor background for each of them. We do not have the right guidance from the director to go for a character. In fact,Naomi could give a lot more depth to her role but stayed at a flat level..It is not a bad film,but that is exactly the problem. I would suggest it to someone to get an idea of what Russian Mafia is because the information provided by the movie is quite accurate and detailed,but nothing more. An average and not very original and innovative plot which in fact raising many questions left unanswered.The end of the movie besides that it left me with a kind of bad taste, it seemed to me that it could be somewhat not so quick and hasty. It could easily be a 130-140 minutes movie with much better results.OK, a nice movie but not of these that I am gonna remember for a long time.",Eastern Promises

It's needlessly graphic ranging from brutal throat slashing to finger severing to the naked bath house hack-fest. Despite the last sentence, there wasn't any real action or intensity in this movie whatsoever. This movie suffered greatly from poor pacing and a lack of any real conclusion to the under cover story. It's like they filmed three quarters of the film and simply got tired of telling the story. Adding to the malaise, the plot twist was easy to spot. As mentioned, the pace was awful. During that singing scene in the restaurant, I looked at the person I saw this movie with as if to say, ""Did they even employ an editor?""

At the end of this film I did internet searches on both the ""vor v zakone"" and the Gulag, for example, and learned a great deal more about organized crime in Russia and the terrible atrocities committed in the Gulag.Finally, the acting is superb and the end of the film had some unexpected twists.So, to recap, not the most realistic film, but definitely one that both entertained and compelled me to learn more about various topics.",Eastern Promises

I'd really like to see how some of you would react if you saw a movie like Ichi the Killer,Audition,Salo or Oldboy or god forbid a Iraqi beheading video!Or better yet come stay in my neighborhood for a week. Get a grip on yourselves for the love of MANkind, it's called real life.Also could we leave the pretense at home and stop reading too much into these things.Like waxing poetically about how Cronenberg is channeling Nietzsche,Dostoyevsky and Anne Frank?It was a good watered down Cronen- berg film that collapsed near the end,nuff said.",Eastern Promises

With excessive, non-required violence (a characteristic of Cronenberg), homo-busted language In the hands of a decent director, could still be a worthwhile film, as the story (with the motherless baby and the nurse's good intentions) is interesting indeed.

While one can't really say they enjoyed viewing this movie because of the violence, one can say they identified with the characters and the character interaction of this film. I feel this movie was actually the only one worthy of an award for 2007. Obviously, politics prevail in the film industry as well as every other industry in our America.

His script is terrific, and it is NEVER boring, Never. The whole cast does a great job (I've particularly appreciated Armin Mueller Stahl...his character was so true). Atmospheres are wonderfully mysterious, and violent scenes were absolutely entertaining (to those who can easily watch them, obviously). I felt surprised too: I expected something different from Cronenberg. It was the same kind of surprise that I felt after having seen ""A History of Violence"". This is not the usual Cronenberg, who became famous with monstrous transformations, exploding heads and absurd situations (similar to Beckett's theater).Cronenberg is never the same. He is changing his themes. He's more interested in men's INTERNAL transformations, in the vision of Violence as an human necessity, in the values of ""respect"" and ""honour"", in the division between ""evil"" and ""good"" people (if there's one), in the thousands of illusions that we have about a better world and a better future.

346,Spaceant,Excellent movie! Keeps you thinking...,9,7 December 2007,"I did not know anything about this movie when I went to saw it, so at first I was puzzled to where it was heading. When I left the theater, I did not know what to make of it in the first place, however, it kept me thinking. The more I think about it, the more I grow to like it! As said already in other comments, it works so well on many levels! The story seemed to develop rather slow and predictable on the one hand and a bit constructed on the other (mainly Anna's actions). However, the reason to watch this movie is not it's story! Directing and acting is superb! The movie feels at times a bit slow, because it lives from it subtleties. Many events and issues are pointed at, but few are shown explicitly. If you watch it as ""just another mobster-flick"" and do not pay attention to the details, you are sure to miss essential aspects of the movie, because it is precisely not just another mobster-flick, it's a thrilling drama!The way the characters develop during the movie is excellent and compelling. If you have not seen it, got to the cinema and watch it, don't wait for the DVD, it's made for the big screen! Be warned, if you expect fast-pace or excessive action you will be disappointed. In my impression, those who think this film is mediocre seem to have missed some crucial elements. -------------------------HERE BE SPOILERS!------------------------I agree, Anna and her family are rather plain and naive. However, that's what they are supposed to be, ordinary people! With Semyon it becomes very quickly obvious that there is something rotten, but every action reveals a bit more of his evil soul. Armin Müller-Stahl successfully transforms from ""nice"" uncle to personified horror! Nikolai comes first of as the archetype ruthless mobster hit-man or cleaner and his character is truly frightening. Through the course of the film, it is very carefully shown that he is actually the good guy. However, his motivations and sincerity remain unclear until the conversation with the police officer, which is great! It makes the plot-twist even more radical, suddenly everything falls into place! If the character would have shown his inner doubts and conflicts more openly during the first part of the movie, the movie would not have built up such a terrifying atmosphere. He is the perfect tragic hero, who does the best as he can but still is torn apart from his love to serve the grater good. Thereby, the film achieves to create a certain warm feeling that the good has won, but avoids the cheesiness of a Hollywood-like happy ending. The question how far different means and sacrifices can be justified in order to reach a certain end remains of course crucial in this context. The biggest problem I had with Kirill, because he was pretty obnoxious and seemed to be depicted over the top. However, as his personal problems are revealed during the course of the film (early death of his mother, lack of recognition from his father, denial of his own homosexuality, alcoholism), it to falls into place and makes much more sense. I am not a big film geek, but Easter Promises is one of the few films which raise my desire to watch them again.",Eastern Promises

There are some interesting twists in the story, but none of them seem unbelievable or even strange. The ending of the story is maybe the most extraordinary achievement and leaves the viewers wondering whether it is actually a happy end - or not.The cast is brilliant, Viggo Mortenson is ripe for the Oscar, and Armin Müller-Stahl presents a brilliant dark version of Marlon Brando in the Godfather.And the Oscar goes to...Cronenberg",Eastern Promises

Action as always with David Cronenberg is raw and believable unlike other high budget films. This has major similarities to the great Godfather film and could become a cult classic in time as word spreads. This really does stand out from all the other films being churned out by Hollywood and the likes. This is pure film making at it best, powerful performances, true character building, raw action and great story telling.

I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed. It lacked any real suspense and the dialog was very hard to understand with the thick accents. I would definitely not put this movie anywhere near on the same par as any of the Godfather movies. If I was watching this movie at home it would not have kept my attention at all. I do think Viggo did an excellent job of acting though as did the others, it just wasn't a very engaging script.

His performance is not flashy and dramatic but he buries himself so much into the character that you really believe him. I heard an interview when this film first came out and David Cronenberg talked about the in-depth research Viggo did for his part. It really shows. It's a great lesson in acting in doing your homework. You really believe he's from Russia. The supporting cast is great too. David Cronenberg is a fantastic director. I'm glad I finally got around to seeing this film. The Fly was amazing. History of Violence was great and this is another wonderful movie. I strongly recommend this film.,Eastern Promises

It shows how the Russian mafia is both out of place, and at the same time in control of the city. Viggo Mortensen's performance is simply fantastic. I am not sure if this is a rumor or true, but supposedly he went around London while on break from filming, with his tattoos still painted on, and was believed to be a Russian mobster. That is how authentic he is in this film. And Naomi Watts holds her own on screen with him. Their chemistry is amazing, and you can't help but want to see them together despite how different their characters are. The film itself is very violent and unabashed, so be prepared. It is not for the faint of heart, but it certainly delivers an authenticity to that world. I am shocked this film didn't make a bigger splash, and that so many people out there have yet to see it.

The ethnic nostalgia of immigrants, which in some way is well achieved (food, music, family, etc), is so strongly associated to mafia, corruption and outlaws that it reinforces racist, intolerant and denigrating stereotypes (i.e. the Greek Weeding revived this nostalgia in a completely different and positive way). The gory parts of the movie are sadistic, tasteless, and overall unnecessary. Performances are good, but the fact that Viggo (despite the fact that he is such a good looking man) is trying so hard to get away from Lord Aragorn roll, is not helping him, in this roll he keeps many qualities of the King of Middle earth: a man of few words, expressive gestures that make up for the few words, calm, never rash.... where is the change? Who is this actor that has been unable to find a decent roll after the trilogy? The movie does not bring anything good or some refreshing point of view to a topic treated endless times in many excellent movies (start with the Godfather) and in exchange for that you have to put up with the most disgusting machismo, bully, and bloody scenes (with no point).

This movie portrays the Russian mafia, and whether I like it or not I couldn't help compare it with a movie like The Godfather because so many sequences remind you of it.Also, a movie has to be believable. This movie has a few parts that are simply not believable. For example:1) There's a baby born in the hospital where the mother dies, and I find it hard to believe that NO authority is looking into it.2) There's a part where the police is getting blood from the bad guy for a DNA test to see if the baby at the hospital is related, but another bad guy walks away with the baby at the hospital, and again no authority is protecting the baby. But not only that, when the blood sample is being sought out from the potential father it is daylight hours, and yet when the baby is taken it is already night time. It sounds like I'm over analyzing, but you can't help thinking about it.3) This movie has some o.k. fight sequence with a ""knife"" at the bath house, but hard to believe guys walk in without any guns to kill Viggo Mortensen's character, or with a BIGGER knife.Lastly, the movie leaves you hanging. Maybe they're thinking of a sequence. Too much sequences nowadays.",Eastern Promises
354,raoganesh,Disconnected,6,27 January 2008,"Having watched A History of Violence , I had expected gruesome scenes , blood and gore,the Cronenberg trademark. Instead, the film as released in India, had just one scene that appears at the beginning.The rest I suppose were edited by our conscientious Censor Board. Perhaps thats a commentary on our movie rating agency which believes that adults in India are too squeamish to stand such gory scenes or worse, that exposing Indian audiences to such scenes might just accelerate the urban crime rate. The same logic is applied by our 'upholder of moral values"" to any sexual/ intimate scenes in Western movies. If they had to cut out these scenes, I wonder what prompted them to rate it as Adults Only ( meaning over 18)? Believe me, Indian mainstream cinema is infinitely more vulgar & downright cheap even without too much of skin show. That being the case, the movie appeared to me to be disconnected. Important scenes that build character and lend continuity to the story were gleefully edited for reasons described above.The history of the stoicism and lethal quality that Nikolai possesses , the anguish of Anna and her internal motivation and similarly those of Seymon and Kirill are either not explored in sufficient detail or perhaps were but for Indian censors. A couple of scenes had no connection to the main story eg Ekrem among some protesters. I didn't get much insight into the working and the internal politics of the Russian Mafia Family, the way it was portrayed in the Godfather.Sadly the end was quite abrupt ;almost anticlimactic after a long buildup.

Beautifully shot in grays and muted reds, the cinematography is stunning, and the violence is gorgeous. The fight scene is not to be missed. I don't think the people in the theater I was in really understood the power of the film until the end. When the end shot went black there was stunned silence and then someone started howling.

There were times during the course of the film that felt reminiscent of the road traveled through the world of Puzo's or Scorsese's Epics. This was especially apparent when the film started to voyage through a path of ethnic diversion whilst all the time being lead by a torch of universal familiarity.

Cronenburg relies way too much on the voyeuristic ""appeal"" of lingering shots of extreme and gratuitous violence to cover the absence of substance in the film, and the implausibility of much of the writing. So the viewer is subjected to multiple scenes of brutal and bloody murderous rage, of prostitution/rape, of the destruction of human flesh which are shocking and generally disgusting, but to what end? By the end of the film, the substitution of violence for story line has reached a point where it almost veers into comedy in a scene in which a nude Viggo Mortenson wrestles with assailants in a steam bath for what seemed like hours and somehow manages by his sheer strength and naked grace to overcome two assailants armed with miniature scythes.This doesn't seem like so much more to swallow, given that we've already been asked to accept a plot involving a 14-year old Russian prostitute who was raped, beaten, drugged with heroin and kept captive but who somehow manages to find both the time and the lucidity to write and conceal a diary providing a detailed litany of evidence against her captors. As a further stretch requiring suspension of one's disbelief, the diary is recovered by a midwife at a local hospital and then ironically brought directly to the man who was responsible for raping and impregnating the prostitute. Must not be many Russians in London I guess. I could go on, but I hope that you get the point.This is a movie that shocks for not much apparent purpose other than to shock.",Eastern Promises
363,delyte,intensely entertaining,8,25 April 2008,"I usually avoid violent pictures, but there's something triumphantly gruesome and elegantly grisly in the way Cronenberg does it, especially now that he's found the right kind of leading man in Mortensen. As the 2 leads, he and Watts are real heroes, and not just stooges like they'd be in a David Lynch movie. Cronenberg always finds the offbeat story and the creepy side, while still placing everything in a classic Hollywood style. Like A History of Violence, this movie poses some interesting questions about the consequences of masculine brutality while still delivering the excitement of a beautifully choreographed fight scene.",Eastern Promises
364,ourson66,Eastern Promises ... and delivers,9,15 September 2007,"In a wet and dreary pre-Christmas London, an anonymous, distressed, 14-year old Russian girl staggers into Trafalgar hospital, on the verge of giving birth, hemorrhaging badly and with obvious heroine tracks on her arms. Pediatric nurse Anna (Naomi Watts) tries in vain to save both mother and baby, but in the end, all that remains is the newborn, and a diary written in Russian in the girl's purse, that contains a business card for a Russian restaurant. Haunted by her own previous miscarriage, and determined that the baby girl not be sent to an orphanage, Anna attempts to have the diary translated in order to identify the anonymous girl's family. In so doing, she becomes embroiled in the dark, seething world of crime, drugs, and prostitution of the Russian Mob. It is an enclosed, hot house society, where family loyalty and responsibility and adherence to the ""vory v zakone"" code of thieves are paramount, and shady characters like the ""restauranteur"" Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), his son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) and his ""driver"" Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen) exist on the periphery of the law.As a long-time fan of Cronenberg's work, it is interesting for me to see his recent films grab the public attention in such a mainstream way. While it is true that both ""A History of Violence"" and ""Eastern Promises"" feature less obviously fantastic elements than, say, ""The Fly"" or ""Scanners"", Cronenberg's uniquely clinical and undramatic visual and storytelling style remain intact throughout all of his films. Nothing in a David Cronenberg film appears on- screen without a reason. He's sort of the film-making equivalent of Ernest Hemingway: a deceptively simple, unflinching eye; a calm surface that somehow manages to get under your skin and hints at labyrinthine depths beneath. Cronenberg's work always makes you uncomfortable, but here in ""Eastern Promises"", it is done very subtly, almost subliminally, so you find yourself thinking about it afterward without realizing it.The acting in Eastern Promises is uniformly excellent. Viggo Mortensen's Nikolai, in particular, displays a still, coiled menace that is chilling and intense, which plays well against Vincent Cassel's portrayal of the feral Kirill, whose confused and tortured attempts to live up to his father's criminal expectations set the plot in motion, and Armin Mueller-Stahl's stunningly nuanced performance as the crime boss Semyon: Satan dressed up as your favorite uncle at Christmastime. As Anna, unwittingly tossed into this den of serpents, Naomi Watts manages to be simultaneously vulnerable and tenacious in a role for which she will doubtless receive too little credit.Cronenberg's no-nonsense approach to violence is still in evidence here, from the shockingly bloody opening scene, to one remarkably brutal fight sequence that deserves to be written down in the annals of film history, and is so astonishing that it isn't until afterward that you register the fact that Viggo Mortensen did the whole thing completely nude. But, in the end, it is the sinuous undercurrent of hope, the trickle of humanity that manages to somehow exist amongst these desperate characters, that sticks with me in this film. The writing hints at things rather than stating them, the muted ""film noir"" visual style enhances this, and even the ""big plot twist"" near the end of the story (that I wouldn't dream of spoiling for you) is handled with the most minimalist of gestures. I swear, sometime soon David Cronenberg is going to discover the meaning of life in a black screen.",Eastern Promises
365,farmerstina,Beautiful and Haunting,9,22 September 2007,"This movie is so beautifully lit and shot, each frame is a feast for the eyes. From the dreary, dark wet streets to the warm, rich interior of the restaurant, just looking at the movie is an experience. All of the performances are extraordinary. Cassel and Mortensen are fascinating in their scenes together. There are so many levels to their relationship; brothers, rivals, lovers? Mueller-Stahl a contrast in grandfatherly warmth and dangerous crime. Mortensen delivers an Oscar worthy performance here and I just won't believe it if he is not nominated. He is quiet, layered, and has incredible physical presence. He says more with his face and body than with any dialog. There are so many themes interwoven in this movie. It would be easy to dismiss this as a run of the mill gangster film but the contrasts and similarities between ""the good guys"" and the ""bad people"" show that we all share the same fears and hopes.",Eastern Promises

This film, if I may state to the writers, producers, directors, cast, and all elements of bringing this surprisingly fantastic film together, as a viewer, PLEASE MAKE A SEQUEL. I want more. It's May 2018, & I have just now viewed this film. This film will be timeless. It will hold together seamlessly as time passes as it is very relevant to what society views the underworld to be. I have read on various film buff websites the sequel, Eastern Promises 2, to be called Body Cross was to begin filming in March of 2017. I was crushed when I read a report the director stopped the production and announced there will be no sequel. This sequel must be made. There is so much about this story to be revealed. It is my opinion as an avid movie viewer, this film is worthy of many sequels and future prequels. I am currently inviting all of my friends through my social media accounts to view this film. Please trust me when I say, produce the sequel to this film. I didn't even know the film existed & I do not know how this one slipped past me. This is the only reason I say it is a surprisingly fantastic dark horse. I didn't see it coming. But I will western promise you this, if you choose to franchise this film, I will pay full price to view your films in the theater and I will be purchasing the digital stream editions for my continued enjoyment at home. This is truly a film I can view over & again. I need more. The story needs to be told. I desperately want to own the set of films you can make from this blockbuster. For what it's worth, I am after all your audience, am I not? Coffee cups, T-shirts, Magnets, decorating my vehicle, my fridge, and flaunting my coffe mug with my film buff best friends.

370,olo_01,Not another American movie,9,22 September 2007,"""Eastern Promisses"" is one of the better movies I have seen lately, the movie itself is made very realistically the reason for that is probably that it was made not in Hollywood and not by another Hollywood super star director, the action paces through the movie very good, it should be underline here that the director shows very good knowledge of a subject of a Russian mob - the tattoo and the usage of Russian language made this movie realistic, another plus is that the movie was shoot in London not in Hollywood. I am very pleased to see Jerzy Skolimowski a polish actor who maybe did not play the main role but he actually appeared in this movie although nothing was mention about him in the trailer or the movie short-take, I am also very pleased to see a few good actors not the ""usual suspects"" who did very good job creating the movie main characters. Overall I must say that it is a good movie and definitely is worth to go and see it. Summarizing this short outtake I want to add that I am pleased to see this yet another good movie after seeing 3 :10 To Yuma with Russel Crowe.",Eastern Promises
371,magicshow-1,EASTERN PROMISES: David Cronenberg's Bastard Child,10,27 September 2007,"EASTERN PROMISES: David Cronenberg's Bastard Childby M.G. WoodSeptember 14th, 2007 (wide release: September 21) Studio: Focus Features Rated: R for strong brutal and bloody violence, some graphic sexuality, language and nudity Running Time: 100 minutesDavid Cronenberg makes violent films. Deadly mutant babies on the prowl in THE BROOD (1979), mind-blowing psychic powers in SCANNERS (1981), the art of surgery and the duality of man in DEAD RINGERS (1988). Delving into the primal nature of violence does not distinguish Cronenberg as a filmmaker, Peckinpah and Scorsese are the modern masters. But, what does separate Cronenberg from the pack, is sex. Sex as violence, violence as sex.Consider Jeff Goldblum's limitless sexual threshold in THE FLY (1986), not for passion or love, but to feast on human flesh like so much spilled sugar. Or Ralph Fiennes complex oedipal web of death and despair, his desperate attempt to unravel the mystery spawned from his mother's womb in SPIDER (2003).But, Cronenberg would have seemed to reach cinematic climax with his adaptation of J.G. Ballard's novel CRASH in 1995, a twisted tale about a libidinous band of damaged souls in search of a good car crash to fuel their sexual desire. But, what seemed like the perfect culmination of a life's work, turned out to be only the beginning for Cronenberg.In 2005 Cronenberg made his most financially successful film to date with the poetically titled A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, wherein Mr. Cronenberg took his subversive message to middle America. American film goers have historically demonstrated little fear of violent images on film, yet turn a puritanical eye toward graphic depictions of sex on screen. Which brings us back to Cronenberg's unique symbolic prowess as a filmmaker. Setting two intricate sex scenes in which to frame the story of a man's present peace and violent past. Early in A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, the small town diner owner played by Viggo Mortenson and his wife (Maria Bello) engage in a little sweet-natured role playing as Ms. Bello dresses up as a high school cheerleader to Mr. Mortenson's All-American rugged charm. Mortenson then proceeds to passionately perform fellatio on his beautiful wife. Cut this side by side with a later scene: after having discovered Mortenson's dark and violent past, Bello initially rejects Mortenson's sexual advances, only to succumb to an ugly, disjointed, and literally bruising sexual encounter on a staircase.In EASTERN PROMISES, Naomi Watts plays a mid-wife on duty at a North London hospital when a brutalized young pregnant woman arrives. The young girl dies, leaving behind a baby and a diary. When Watts discovers the diary is written in Russian, she becomes determined to have the diary translated. In her desperate desire to learn the dead girl's secrets and how she came to die such a tragic death, Ms. Watts ends up at the doorstep of a family restaurant run by a Russian patriarch played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. Mueller-Stahl agrees to translate the diary, but Watts soon learns Mueller-Stahl is not the kindly old grandfather he appears to be, but rather the head of an East European crime family.Enter Viggo Mortenson, a lowly chauffeur for the family. Mortenson immediately takes an interest in Watts, but Watts is understandably resistant. Mortenson has designs on moving up in the ""business"", aspirations he longs to prove to Mueller-Stahl. Meanwhile, he must cater to the every sophomoric whim of Mueller-Stahl's spoiled son (Vincent Cassel). Cassel decides that Mortenson must prove his manhood, prove he has the balls to be a player in the ""family"". How? By whacking someone? By committing a random act of violence? No, Mortenson must prove he's a man by having sex with a young prostitute. Mortenson complies after Cassel literally holds a gun to his head. Mortenson f**ks (and there is no better way to describe it) this young girl with a passionless expression upon his face, all the while retaining constant eye contact with Cassel, as if to say, ""I'm an animal, just like you.""A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE ended with a simple, yet potent shot of Viggo Mortenson sitting down to dinner with his family. In EASTERN PROMISES, David Cronenberg leaves us with a glowing final frame of film depicting the bastard child of the raped and murdered prostitute being cradled by it's surrogate mother.From American-Vulture.Com",Eastern Promises

373,vermont23,Another masterpiece,10,11 September 2007,"Eastern Promises is a further proof David Cronenberg is one of the last classic film-makers left. At the same time, he is a modernist. The combination, in the dark London he created, is a moral tale which makes you think of Dostoievsky. It's a story of crime and redemption with an unusual (hidden) tenderness. At the same time, it is a very serious trip into the rites of a secret society as we can see more and more in our big cities. A criminal secret society.Cronenberg (and his friend Peter Suschistky) have created another universe that seems another version of ours. As usual it is a mental one, but so close to what we call ""reality"" that it makes you uncomfortable and eventually horrified. The cast is fantastic and the script is brilliant.",Eastern Promises

I really liked the idea of joining both Russian and English societies and bringing them to the big screen. However, sometimes it was difficult to listen to the accent and especially for me, as a foreigner. I cannot say how would it sound to native speakers.The cast has been selected very well. However, Viggo Mortensen did not fit into his part in my opinion. He is a bit too far away of a real Russian. I really like him in general, but this part was not for him.

Cronenberg NEVER sacrifices artistic merit and quality for artifice and philistinism (read on Quentin Tarantino, you fraud..). Cronenberg, along with the other three Davids (David Lynch and David Mamet) IS one of the finest living American (ex-Canadian) Directors around... and one of the top ten Directors in the world.....if you do not like intelligent, cosmopolitan, artistic, eclectic, iconoclastic and script-driven films, please stay home...you will not like this film.",Eastern Promises
379,shoot-hobos,"Don't watch this if you want your hand held, this is a real film",9,3 December 2007,"It's like this film was custom built for me, absolutely loved it. The basic premise is that of a 14 year old prostitute who dies in childbirth in the care of midwife Anna (Naomi Watts) and leaves nothing but a diary as a clue to her identity. With the child surviving Anna sets out to locate her family and deliver the new baby home in a bid to avoid the fostering system. As the film progresses we see her gradually digging deeper into the grim world of London's Russian gangsters. Combining the alien with the familiar, and throwing a normal, average person into the mix, Eastern Promises manages to make for a gritty yet exotic thriller that is also chillingly close to home. I loved the graphic nature of the film as well. It washes away so many gripes I have with far too many films, such as cutting away from the shot milliseconds before something brutal happens. Not here. Just unflinching shots of the macabre! It's much like A History Of Violence in that respect, and with the same director and star, mixed in with similar themes, that hardly comes as a surprise. It also shares AHOV's pacing in that it's really a very short film - just 100 minutes - and is predominantly an understated affair, with just a couple of extremely visceral scenes standing out from the brooding and gritty tone of the bulk. As such I won't go into any detail about any of the nastier moments as they're such individual pieces you really want to experience them first hand, but suffice to say I spent the best parts of the film either flinching or laughing in bloody, Tarantino-esquire delight.Of course this kind of film relies hugely - entirely, even - on top class performances of top class characters. Thankfully Eastern Promises really, really delivers. Naomi Watts takes a character that could so easily have been little more than a dull, nosey do-gooder and turns her into someone with real compassion. In a similar respect Vincent Cassel's role as hot-headed, son-of-the-boss Kirill is turned from what would have been little more than the bare skeleton of an archetype into someone with real depth and emotion through another fantastic performance. Kirill is a character who the viewer will find themselves hating with a passion, but also sympathising with. The other supporting roles, such as Anna's eccentric Russian uncle Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski) are executed to a similar standard. Indeed one of the more sinister roles goes to Armin Mueller-Stahl as the outwardly benign restaurant owner, who's real identity is that of a cruel and cunning gangster boss. However with one big character left unsaid I'm sure none of you who know anything about this film will be surprised when I say that far and away the best show is put on by Viggo Mortensen as the taciturn Nickolai. Wielding an extremely understated and quiet performance with stunning dexterity, Mortensen manages to conjure incredible depth with the barest expression. Nickolai is both humble, menacing, caring, but above all ice cool and incredibly likable. I find myself saying this a lot about great performances but this really is brilliant. While on par with the likes of Paddy Considine in Dead Man's Shoes, it'd be a more accessible comparison to maybe put Nickolai beside Travis Bickle or Randle McMurphy. Don't believe me? Watch Eastern Promses and tell me I'm wrong.The only major fault I can see with it isn't really a fault in my eyes - it's really one of those moments in film which is likely to divide opinion down the middle. It's the ending. Considering some of the highlights it's easy to expect some extremely harsh, typically gangster ending in the same vein as Casino. Instead it closes on a surprisingly sombre note, it's reflective more than anything. Personally I loved it, it really helped capture the tone of the film, but popcorn movie goers might find it a little uneventful. Nonetheless, with a craftsmanship that really makes you feel it was the director, not producer, calling the shots Eastern Promises is both an original and amazingly refreshing film. While some scenes will have you gasping and flinching, you're guaranteed to come away from the film with deeper thoughts rushing through your head and in honesty, they're unlikely to leave. With many sub-plots which are implicated - not spelled out - it's not a film that's going to hold your hand, but it really will make you think. One thing I can say is it's also brilliantly named. It's not often a title will really stand out to me, but having seen the film I feel confident in saying that 'Eastern Promises' is nothing less than poetry.",Eastern Promises

We discussed after the screening that the Italians, unlike us, must be used to this as they are often shown in popular films. The most believable characters are extras, probably they were really Russians.So we had to spend most of the time trying to separate the feeling of watching a terrible performance, which came simply from the fact that it doesn't look or sound or feel real at all: from the rest of the feelings. The bath scene is incredible, especially having read now that it was filmed without stunts. The good news is that it's the only scene that stands separately, the rest of the movie is watched as one piece of art.But being all that busy analyzing what did we just see, we're still confused, we all missed the idea behind showing Semyon (the father, The Bad Guy) as someone who is blind.I mean it's a weird make up effect obviously, but none of us really didn't understood if it has any meaning besides metaphoric one.If anyone can suggest anything - thank you in advance.",Eastern Promises

I don't want to give any story lines away, but there was a major piece of the story missing. The drama built as the worlds began to collide, but there was never that final moment that brings everyone together. Ana gets what she wants too easily, and the Nicholi's choices are too easily made.

Viggo Mortensen is a great actor, and i think his performance was the only thing OK about this film, but even he cant save this awful script.

The nurse then looks to find out the past of the mother, and gets involved with ""bad people"" Although, nothing really exciting happens and there are no action or fight scenes, which was really disappointing. I enjoyed History of Violence, for its clever story and thinking, as it left me on the edge of my chair with my jaw to the floor. It was creative and inventive and had a good story while Eastern Promises left you hanging, and wanting more. If you see it block buster, I would leave it there and pick up History of Violence again.

In fact the part that got me the most was when Viggo cuts off the dudes finger.But enough about what everyone else is talking about. I want to speak about the movie as a whole and what Cronnenberg achieves. In his last two films Cronnenberg has gotten raved performances by his top billed actors. And how he does it is wonderfully new. Many people are going for the whole isolated lead lately with the shot of them surrounded by people moving and they are just standing and looking sad. What Cronnenberg does is gets his actors maximum performance by having them subdue the charatcer so much and play opposites so often that it is refreshing and keeps the audience intrigued.The one prefromance that mirrors this to perfection is the role of the Crime Boss-Stahl. He hardly raises his voice above much more than a whisper, and he sincerely is 20 times more frightening that way than if he were to act like Pacino in Scarface. I was utterly terrified of his character and the possible past he may of had. Also the fact that Cronnenberg continually shows a soft side of him makes that character even more intimidating.Viggos performance is stellar. His Russian accent and dialect is very believable. His quiet intensity that he brings to the character is very powerful, yet you can see through his tough exterior that he has a heart. The very out-of-nowhere kiss he shares with Naomi Watts is perfect. It is more of a comfort and less than a sexual kiss. All of his relationships are very defined and structured. His most interesting is the one he shares with Vincet Cassel, as I had read on an online report it has a lot of sexual tension, which it had. I can't really relate it to anything I have seen before. But it is very fun to watch the both of them play it out. It is great to see how cold he can be and steely, and like I said see the sensitive caring side.I could go on and on about this movie. I was throughly entertained, and on the edge of my seat throughout. Beware, you need to be attentive through the movie, some of the dialog is difficult to catch. The only complaint for me is the ending, which I won't share. 9/10 Oscar Caliber!!!Sorry for any spelling mistakes!",Eastern Promises
390,ypablo,Totally unconvincing!,6,19 January 2008,"I cannot believe that no one has noticed this story is not convincing at all! Every ordinary person with a bit of common sense would go to the police straight away or at least at some point. Instead she waits in front of Russian Mafia's door to shout out at the godfather that he raped someone like some kind of mental person, for what?! to ashamed him? GIVE ME A BREAK! And we can find plenty of this kind of moments which tear the story apart: kissing scene at the end of the movie is just ridiculously stupid and does not fit to the whole story. It is totally out of blue and Hollywood-style at it worst. It's very, very poor scenario and even Viggo's great performance could not save the movie. 6 out of 10 for the actor's prep.",Eastern Promises

392,dreamfeed-1,"The more I reflect on it, the less I like it",6,25 September 2007,"If you are a fan of classic Cronenberg (like Crash or Videodrome) this film will disappoint you. It is a far more conventional narrative with more conventional (some might say ""better"") acting then his older films. What is unfortunate is that, for me at least, the story was completely unsatisfying.This movie started off really well. Each character had complexity and all seemed to be exploring of the relationships between personal morality, society, and violence in different ways. By the end, every character was a cookie cutter good guy / bad guy (with the notable exception of Kirill - Vincent Cassel steals this show in a lot of ways). All of Viggo Mortensen's badassness can't save him from the script's cop-outs.Revisiting the comparison to Cronenberg's earlier stuff, this movie definitely did not make me think. Not that every movie should be weird and philosophically driven, but you're making a thriller, it needs a way tighter plot than this.Definitely worth watching for the brutal fight scene alone, but on the whole, just goes to show that ""History of Violence"" was a damn near impossible act to follow.",Eastern Promises
393,toisin,The plots make no sense,1,29 September 2007,"This is one of the worst movie I have ever seen. Being a thriller, the plot must make sense. This movie just glides over tons of obvious problems. There are many things that is no way would happen. It feels like the director just used a bunch of gross dramatic killing scenes and some tough gangster feel to make the movie seems so different. But the story line is extremely sloppy. There is no plot, in two seconds, you know exactly who is the bad guy and who is the good guy. And then before the movie progress, you almost know exactly what is going to happen next. The most important thing about a thriller is the story. The movie ended and I was like, huh, this is it?",Eastern Promises
394,nit007,Eastern Promises More Than It Delivers,2,4 October 2007,"Up until this point, I had usually found IMDb to be fairly accurate as to whether a film would be good or bad. However, I'm amazed at all the accolades this movie has received on this website. It's painfully obvious that this is a terrible cliché of a mafia movie that tries way too hard and ultimately winds up being a complete disappointment.The script was so poorly written I actually found myself laughing at how bad some of the lines were. The characters were totally one-dimensional, and I found myself not really caring about what happened to any of them. Also, this movie was SLOW. Even the excessive violence and gratuitous sex and nudity couldn't make this film interesting. It's like the director knew how lame this film was, and he went back and added in those elements just so people would go see it.The best acting I saw in the whole film was from Vincent Cassel who played Kirill. Due to a bad script, the talents of the rest of the cast were wasted or marginalized, at best. The acting seemed forced in almost every scene, and rarely did you find yourself drawn into the film.Bottom Line: The only reason to see this movie is Viggo Mortensen's nude scene in the steam room. Him being naked in the fight scene was completely gratuitous, and served absolutely no purpose in the film. I actually felt sorry for Viggo because the director took advantage of his willingness to do this pointless nude scene and completely overexposed him. The audience does not need to repeatedly see his dick, balls, and ass to understand that he was in a vulnerable position. Besides, you couldn't even enjoy this scene if you wanted to, because of the brutality and gore.My advice: Go rent ""The Departed"" if you want to see a good gangster film with an excellent plot and great acting.",Eastern Promises
395,acidbazz,the outcome would have been much better if only English was spoken,6,13 October 2007,"The concept itself was actually pretty good, but the way it was presented, was somehow boring and torpid. Lots of criticism for the usage of Russian language. Also some issues were handled confusingly. (i.e. the newborn child and Anna) But still my main criticism goes to the usage of foreign language. As I live next to Russia and almost half of the people in my motherland are Russians, I have to say: the pronunciation of the words was almost all the time below quality standards. Also, some of the words used in scenes, were inappropriate for some situations. And Russian language is much faster and emotional than presented in the movie, also using both languages in one sentence is confusing. So my main concern is that I don't understand if there are really no Russians in Hollywood, so he/she could teach some elementary basics about the language. They should be able to afford any teacher. Much to think about for filmmakers using foreign languages.But my conclusion is still in positive tone. The movie itself was deep and touching and also with some good characters. Would have been even better if the story was told completely in English. Certainly I recommend seeing this motion picture.",Eastern Promises
396,mgoorevich,Not so Kronenberg movie.,1,30 October 2007,"I am a big fan of Mr. Kronenberg's art of motion picture. These words can best describe how this director usually treat the picture, the sound, the acting, directing and editing. However I feel that in Eastern Promises there are so many disappointments and incorrectness. I even don't know where it all starts. I guess the script is awful first of all. Those kind of scripts should be given to exercise to some smaller ranked directors. But Kronenberg how could he work with this script? Money??? One of the greatest problem of the movie is the cast and the language. My native language is Russian and there was no one-I mean no one phrase, which I could trust. Wrong understanding of Russian mentality, wrong use of Russian language in corresponding situations. This movie looks like some of the 80' Brooklyn mafia Hollywood mid budged features. Even good actors didn't help. I think that this is very complicated issue. And it's extremely difficult now days to built a story about mafia. And about Russian mafia particularly without going in some stereotypes and clichés. It's not enough if you have Russian dialogs coach on the set and have read some books about the ""zona"". It all comes together. Mr Kronenberg should have lived at least 5 years in Russia in order to get closer to what's going on. I don't live in Russia for 15 years and I feel that I am lost with their present mentality. You cannot make a movie about something if you don't feel that you completely understand it Other wise it becomes - Eastern Promises.",Eastern Promises

Non of the men in this movie can be considered as (vor v zakone) which means (Thief in law) . This is embarrassment to the Russian criminal world. If you don't understand how the Russian criminal world works, then this would be a great movie for you, because it is action packed, violent, has sex, and drug use, which makes a good movie, however it does not have a good plot. All I am saying is that there wasn't much research done to make it as close to the real life as possible. However this is just my opinion.

399,calle_110,One of the worst films I've ever seen!,1,23 November 2007,"I went to the Stockholm Filmfestival screening and had big hopes for this movie since it had been announced as one of their top films.I have to be honest; it was the most horrible movie I've ever seen... The movie had no qualities what so ever:Firstly, trying to capture another culture is difficult, and even more so trying to make it believable on screen. Cronenberg has done a terrible job in trying to portray the Russian culture and even so the British as in the meaningless Chelsea football scene. The scene never felt real and didn't produce an authentic picture of what England is like.Secondly, the dialog and the acting was bad. Any Russian citizen could have done a better job in portraying a more truthful character than either Viggo Mortensen or Vincent Cassel. It's actually embarrassing watching them speak Russian or trying to act the real deal.Thirdly. Where is the story? really?!Also, I can't stress it enough how disturbing the little remarks or jokes or what ever they are supposed to be on people being queer/gay or having another ethnic background and so forth. Sure this might well be opinions that people involved in organized crime have, but to splutter these things out like is being done in this film will only lead to a mockery of these issues. This leads me to my conclusion that this film doesn't contribute to any understanding or positioning against this type of violence or violent people.

You cannt find too many violenceIn this movie (at up-to-date standards, i think), the mobsters are antagonists without alternative. And the sense... you can find it in this movie.

403,sunnyata,An utterly dull and pathetic attempt to portray Russian mafia,2,22 December 2007,"I am astonished that so many viewers have given this film high ratings. I tend to think that if you are going to do something, you should do it right -- a principle which the director of this film was obviously oblivious to or chose to avoid.Despite the fact that the actors actually tried to learn some of their Russian lines and worked on their Russian accents, it still felt very fake and contrived. When trying to please Western audiences and appealing to their sense of what being Russian is all about, it is sufficient to throw in prostitutes, vodka and plenty of 'R's. And that's precisely what was done in this movie. But why go through all the trouble of forcing the poor actors to memorize lines in Russian? If you wanted the film to be authentic, you should have used Russian-speaking actors in the first place, not a bunch of old farts that can't speak the language and don't look even remotely Russian. Same goes for Vincent Cassel and Viggo Mortensen, who look about as Russian as Mr. Bean.If the director was trying to be original, why didn't he use some Punjabi actors to play the Russian mafia? I am sure they could roll their 'R's much better too. As long as you make sure there is a bottle of (unidentifiable) vodka or a naked whore in every scene, it will surely spell R-U-S-S-I-A to our sophisticated Western viewers. And to spice things up, throw in the most artificial and boring plot ever. Overall, the film is some of the most nonsensical garbage I've seen in a long time. I suggest the director actually see some Russian mafia before attempting to make a film about it.",Eastern Promises

Virgin Mary with Child on abdomen: I am true tomy friends / My conscience is clear (could also mean ""prison is my home""). Raven on shoulder: Death, I am not yours. Starburst on finger: I became a criminal because of poverty and a broken home. Cross on finger: I was in the Crosses (a prison in St. Petersburg).

There is an clear deficiency in the script, as others have pointed out. A weak script gives actors nothing to work with. They simply *say* lines, rather than feel them and then emote them by voice and physical expression. This creates cardboard performances. EASTERN PROMISES is about as dry and crispy as it gets.

I've seen it 3 times on cable, and every time found additional nuances to the plot and his performance.Certain movie scenes have the potential to become ""iconic"" (the psycho shower scene, the ring, etc). the tattooing scene in ""eastern promises"" has such potential.Be forewarned.

Not too many films have the power to take me completely into their world. Credit has to be given specifically to Vigo, for his willingness to let go of any pretensions and do whatever it takes to portray the role of Nikolai. Not knowing the true nature of Nikolai will allow you to honestly follow Vigo, as his portrayal sends you through a gamut of emotion. Wanting to trust him, fearing him, loving him and hating him, having hope and giving up.

412,Dismas444,"This is no ""Lock, Stock""...",8,26 October 2007,"I'm surprised by the amount of people slamming this film for being mediocre... a film not living up to the absolute peak of the auteur film-maker's usual standard doesn't make it a poor film, simply one of missed potential.This is a film where you can tell real effort was put in to capture the atmosphere and mechanics of the seam of illegality that runs through London, much like Dirty Pretty Things (which shares the same writer). Viggo Mortensen and others spent time in Russia, including the unsavoury belly of Siberian prisons, to get to grips with the people and ideas they'd be portraying.Most London-based films will always include a montage of Big Ben and Trafalgar Square, dodgy-accented cockney geezers and, if it can be helped, a red bus and/or telephone box. Eastern Promises eschews all of this for a very gritty (a word overused, but in this case very applicable) and revealing look at what is fairly true-to-life of both the London crime scene, and that of the new Russian mafia abroad.As someone who works not 100 yards from the very ""restaurant"" where a good chunk of this is filmed, I have a very good understanding of the area and it's inhabitants... I encounter people like all of the characters more or less every day. The scary thing is, I've dealt with over-loud wannabe-kingpins like Vincent Cassel's brash ""prince"" of the family, as well as the good-hearted second generation immigrants who are like Watts' Anna. All the locations used for filming are on my ""turf"" and, for once, a director captures a slice of London that isn't often seen. This is real London, not the Hollywood-like glamour you usually see. And yet, you also see beauty and intrigue as well as the ugliness; the juxtaposition of sun and green gardens of the ""normal people"" in the film against the dark, wet, unwelcoming depths of Farringdon (which bridges the gap between grimy and trendy). But like with real London, the characters are somewhat alone, detached from the rest of the city walking around them... only a brutal fight scene near the end of the film brings to light the occasional clash of the gang world and the ""normal"" world, a divide that is pointed out in the film repeatedly.But alas, I'm rambling. This is a very sound film from a very, very good director. It may fall a little step short of the fantastic A History Of Violence, but it keeps one interest throughout with stellar performances, a subtle but well-executed soundtrack, and some interesting cinematography.

I think that the social and cultural element of the Russians is portrayed really good and the very clear contradiction between the two worlds of Anna and Nicolai. However, the movie is going into detail on some elements in the beginning while it lacks the real emotions of the main characters. Why did Nicolai join the cops? Why is Kirill so aggressive about his dad (something happened in the past) What did he find in Nicolai that attractive.. is there an emotional connection? (there is a hint about him being gay).

French? how is that at all related to Russia? just because you say you can speak the language, doesn't mean you should be cast! even worse, i (who am fluent in the Russian language) couldn't understand some of the things these actors said!! they completely butchered the language!!! the idea was good, girl pregnant.. raped.. mob. but come on, at least do it with class! what happened, did all the Russian actors go on strike or something? if you truly want to make a movie that should be considered great, you should at least get the basics down. i laughed and gagged through the whole movie, it really had potential but due to ridiculous decisions it flops in every European's eyes! the Italian mob days are over, so now we're going for the Russian mob? at least there was more known about the Italian mob when making classics like godfather. if anyone actually thinks that the Russian mob is like this, you've got another thing coming. they're probably laughing at you because you ""think you know... but seriously you have no idea""! just as the polish Skolimowski spat in Mortensen's face, i spit at this movie. it deserves no awards for the crap that was delivered.",Eastern Promises
416,bwittwer,5 more reasons the movie was bad,1,22 September 2007,"For those fans of my first post...I don't comment often but this movie was genuinely awful and I feel like I should warn people who (like me) will be swayed by the UNBELIEVABLY good reviews it is getting, comparing it to the Godfather and Goodfellas etc. Before you read, please note the following:-I saw previews for this movies before hearing reviews and thought it looked stupid. -I have seen a lot of crime movies and eastern European movies so I like the genre a lot -I genuinely wanted to like this movie and expected to like it going in. -This review will have a lot of spoilers. It's more of a rebuttal to anyone who liked the movie (I'm looking at you, Peter Travers!)Now then, some assorted points about why the film was terrible: 1.) There's a reason it seems bad in previews. The title is stupid and the scenes they show are just a bunch of disjointed clichés. The only reason to see the movie is the promise that it is more than it seems, a promise I bought into. Truthfully, the entire film is exactly like a preview, a directionless mess of pointless dialogue and bad clichés about Russia/Britan. 2.) The twists aren't twists. Director Cronenberg doesn't seem to understand subtlety. Instead of allowing the viewer to find things out, which is the entire fun of these films, he simply tells you the next twist at the appropriate time. Watching this movie is more like watching a summary of events than of actual events. The two best examples of this (SPOILERS but honestly who cares because you shouldn't see it) are when Nicolai's boss outright states that he is with Scotland Yard, and when Nicolai is set up by the mob boss. I saw both of these coming a mile away, but the problem is that I didn't deduce them or figure them out, the direction outright tells you what is coming next and then executes the scene. 3.) The filmmaker does not know when to include non-essential scenes, nor how to do so. Examples of these scenes are the wedding scene in The Godfather and the dinner scene in prison in Goodfellas. Both of those scenes are non-essential to the plot but do a good job of establishing the setting and putting human faces on the characters. These scenes are so effective precisely because they flow with the movie and the viewer remains interested in them despite knowing that they probably won't drive the plot. It's just like the film saying, here's some more looks at the characters, if you want And you do want, because it adds to the overall film. Well, in Eastern Promises, these scenes are thrown in pointlessly and add nothing. One example is the scene with the Russian singing at dinner, which is long, boring, stereotypical, and adds nothing to the film. Another example is the scene where it is revealed (!!!) that Anna had a miscarriage with a black man, and here uncle makes some racist comments. This is a great example of why the film fails because the miscarriage info IS important but it is dwarfed by the unnecessary addition of the ""racist, old-country values"" of her uncle which add nothing to his character and never come up again. In fact, we have a pretty positive view of him throughout the film as he helps Anna. 4.) The plot goes nowhere. I can't stress this point enough. You are introduced to the initial point of conflict (the baby and the diary) and they take almost 2 hours to resolve that when you ALREADY KNOW what is going to happen. A successful film would have used this as a jumping off point to immerse the viewer in the world of crime, building on the initial premise and producing a more dynamic look at the subject matter. Instead, we only understand any of the characters through the lens of the ONLY plot device in the film. The equivalent would be if The Godfather movie was entirely about the attempt on Don Vito's life and left out the rest of the film or the other story lines set up during the beginning (sorry for the comparisons to the Godfather, I just know a lot of people have seen it and it's a comparison made by reviews). 5.) The attempts at humor aren't funny; they are stupid and diminish the film. There are a number of ""jokes"" which are essentially, hey, Russians talk funny and are barbaric, ha ha ha! I was actually shocked that this type of humor was in the film if only because it so obviously detracts from the film in such a direct way. You are trying to set up the Russian mob as being powerful and intimidating, so poking fun at their customs and speech only serves to make the villains seem trivial (all the more reason Anna is so easily able to stand up to them).",Eastern Promises
417,sol85,Mixed accolades for Cronenberg,5,16 October 2007,"This movie does not deserve high praise nor polemical deterrence. The plot suffers due to a variety of unnecessary kliché's, and not a single character in this movie is interesting, and none of them appear to be fully constructed.1. Anna (Naomi Watts). She is the classical good samaritan; beautiful, sincere, kind-hearted, with a loving family and a troubled past. The past, which is briefly mentioned (the abortion) could have been used to give her some dept, but isn't. In stead, she appears random, doing what anyone would suppose that someone did.2. Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen). This character is terribly flawed. He is brutal towards the body he degrades, roguish toward Anna at times, loving towards the baby, and seemingly towards Kirill in the end. And why-oh-why is he an undercover agent? Again the character seems random, without depth.3. Kirill (Vincent Cassel). Again a stereotype. So obvious that he does not need to be explained, but still to much of a kliché to be interesting. And what on earth is the purpose of the gay-hints, and his passionate looks at Nikolai? 4. Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl). Another stereotype. He was manipulative, a supposed intelligent godfather, but much to soft at times and without the punch that made Vito Corleone a very credible killer and Leviathan. And the birthday seance, borrowing heavily from ""Godfather"" and ""GoodFellas"" became a ridiculous attempt of showing the Russian spirit.5. Anna's mother and uncle. They had no clout and importance, and just took up screen-time. And why on earth was Azim's son Ekrem a retard? The movie especially lost its credibility at three points; the mother dying without any authorities interfering; Kirill's abduction of the baby, especially when its shown that he would have had to pass hospital staff; and obviously Nikolai's sudden revelation of undercover police agent status.Advocating for this movie are its graphics. The visual setting is very good indeed, the finger-removal and throat-slitting being very well made (however, I did find it odd, that the attempted murder of Nikolai was conducted with two small knifes, but perhaps Cronenberg realized that blasting Nikolai into pieces with shotguns would not be as aesthetically interesting as a long knife-fight, and would ruin his attempt of creating a plot).To sum it up: A bad script with uninteresting characters, several useless scenes, and over-the-top plot twists. But, just as in ""A history of violence"", which could by summed up the exact same way, the movie is saved to a light-medium mark, by good graphics. Satisfying work for a film-school student, focusing on aesthetics, not satisfying at all for an established Hollywood-director with a big budget.",Eastern Promises
418,axelrose-06394,Time wasting movie,1,20 October 2020,I watched this film because of 4 big names in it. Very stupid script very nonsense scenario and weak plays except Mortensen. I will never recommend this to my friends.,Eastern Promises
419,JoeyCartoonz,"Awful, boring movie",1,1 September 2009,"Eastern Promises was a poorly executed film. For a Crime/ Drama/ Thriller, it had crime, a bit of drama, and absolutely no thrill. The movie just kinda floated along and then it ended. I have always liked Viggo and I thought the acting in the movie was good, but the movie was boring. Cronenberg once against shows that all he really loves to do in his films is fill them with non-necessary nudity and excessive gore. By doing that he took a very good script and plot in A History of Violence and turned it into an average movie. With Eastern Promises all he did was make a boring, lifeless movie even worse. Like I said before, I like Viggo, but his performance was not Oscar-nominated worthy. So I guess if you want to sit for 100 minutes and see some good acting in an awful and monotonous movie go rent it and see what I am yammering about.",Eastern Promises
