0,Leofwine_draca,A weak lead; but the rest's pretty good,6,1 July 2018,"THE SHALLOWS is yet another survival flick in which a young, bikini-clad woman is menaced by an impossibly menacing killer shark. This one was shot on the glorious Queensland coast in Australia, and features Blake Lively (doing what her husband Ryan Reynolds did in BURIED) as a woman attacked and stranded by an improbably hungry shark. The film takes a minimalist approach but fails to entertain on the same level as similar mini-classics such as THE REEF and ROGUE, although it's still an enjoyable watch. The cinematography is very nice indeed, and the shark itself, although barely seen, utilises some effective CGI to create the menace. I was less impressed with the lead character, although her survivalist skills and instincts are fun, and I suppose that's what stopped me from being totally immersed in the experience as I was hoping to be. Still, this is a cut above all of the shark movies put out by The Asylum and SyFy Channel.",The Shallows
1,SnoopyStyle,Blake Lively better than expected,7,25 July 2016,"Texan Nancy Adams (Blake Lively) is a medical student vacationing in Mexico. Her friend abandons her for a guy. She wants to surf the same isolated beach as her late mother did many years ago. She gets a lift from local Carlos who doesn't tell her the name of the beach or doesn't understand her question. She is joined by two local surfers. She video-chats with her sister Chloe and then her father. She goes out alone, plays with dolphins, encounters a dead whale, and gets attacked by a shark.Blake Lively has not been my favorite actress. She always seem like the SoCal girl no matter what the role requires. She's a beautiful woman but she has never struck me as a complex actress. Recently, she has gotten better. This one continues her recent uptick. Director Jaume Collet-Serra has cut his teeth on tight thrillers and horrors. He's able to squeeze out a small compelling little thriller out of Lively. The setting looks beautifully tropical. This is not anything ground breaking but it does work.",The Shallows
2,Prismark10,Open Jaws,5,17 April 2017,"Blake Lively plays Nancy, a medical student taking time off from her studies and plans to go to a secluded beach in Mexico with a pal for some surfing. Let down by her friend she heads alone hoping for a period of self reflection as this was the beach her now deceased mother once visited when she was young.While she is surfing alone she is attacked by a large shark. Injured, bleeding she is stranded on a rock. She looks for help but no one is about, her medical skills are used to patch herself up the best she can and she realises that she is only safe on the rock as it is low tide. As the tide rises, she needs to get to safety, but the shark is circling round. Nancy needs to somehow outwit the shark.This is really a low budget B movie. The CGI is ordinary and the story is preposterous. Nancy is in a remote location but she gets excellent wifi and a mobile phone signal.The shark is of course demented, hell bent in gobbling up Nancy when their are other food sources about (maybe he saw her performance in Savages!)",The Shallows
3,claudio_carvalho,"Technically Difficult to Make, Cartoonish Conclusion",6,27 December 2018,"After losing her mother, the medical student Nancy (Blake Lively) dumps the medical school in Galveston and travels to Mexico, hitchhiking to a hidden beach that her mother loved when was young. She brings a backpack and a surf board to surf and she meets two surfers that warn about the low and high tides schedule. They leave the sea, but Nancy decides to stay a little more. When she sees a dead whale floating on the water, she swims close to the animal and is surprised by a white shark. She is bitten on the leg and uses her medical knowledge to survive on a rock. But the high tide is coming and she is under siege of the ferocious shark.""The Shallows"" is a reasonable dramatic thriller with ups and downs. It is certainly a film difficult to be made in an environment where everything is under movement and it might be difficult to synchronize the vessel, crane, cast and animals in such environment. Blake Lively might convince as a surfer provided she let only the stunts swim since her arms and legs movements are not from a swimmer with the practice to face those tides. The unrealistic cartoonish conclusion is disappointing with the shark crashing on the buoy mooring debris subsea, remembering the Looney Tunes characters The Road Runner playing tricks to Wile E. Coyote. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Águas Rasas"" (""Shallow Waters"")",The Shallows

She has opted to go surfing at ""The Secret Beach"" in Mexico, an isolated cove with excellent cell phone reception. While doing so she becomes the victim of a shark nuisance, injured and ""island hopping"" becoming a fighter and using her first aide training.Yup. That is it.

5,kosmasp,Lonely and Deadly,6,12 January 2017,"The movie is very particular in setting up perimeters and rules. And making it as believable as possible, that in a modern time like this, someone would not be able to call for help (apart from the usual ""no service"" kind of cheat other movies do when it comes to Cell Phones). And if you buy into it, it works.There's also the question why Livelys character goes there in the first place. Well even that is explained, so there is no doubt about motive too. What never is explained though, is not where the Shark came from or why it got there, but how it's possible that it's so bloodthirsty! We're talking Jason Vorhees or any other Slasher movie kind of mad. Maybe even more mad than that.And while you could easily go, well it's a movie, it kind of breaks it's own rules there. Because everything seems logical (explaining mentioned), even the character and her ability to deal with (graphic) wounds ... but not the shark, who is really a monster if you come to think of it. But if you don't care about internal logic, like the view (no pun intended) and the thrill of it, you will have a good (scary) time watching this!",The Shallows
6,Sleepin_Dragon,I'm not going in the water again!!,8,10 May 2017,"As someone who has a huge fear of open water I always watch this kind of film with a sunken feeling, the rest for me is always how realistic the film is, the more silly and ridiculous the more I unwind and watch more easily. This had me on edge for the full duration, a true sense of terror as soon as the action got going. At no point did the film feel predictable, nor could you possibly know what was coming next.Not much in terms of a cast, indeed Nancy has pretty much the entire screen time, apart from a very tame seagull. Blake Lively is excellent throughout.The scenery of this film is breathtaking, such an exquisite place, you cannot help but be blown away by the visuals, fabulous camera work, and really good special effects, it is a visual treat.I hated the music, way too heavy for the film, and I didn't like the way the way the conversations popped up on screen either, minor faults though.If you're like me and your heart sinks at the thought of being abandoned in open water then I can assure you this film will leave you with one hell of an uncomfortable feeling. This is very, very good 8/10",The Shallows
7,jboothmillard,The Shallows,5,30 August 2016,"Jaws started it all, followed of course by its three terrible sequels, and many movies about sharks have followed: Deep Blue Sea, Open Water, The Reef and Shark Night to name a few, oh, and crap like Sharknado, this was the latest in the trend, directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax, Orphan, Unknown, Non-Stop). Basically medical student Nancy Adams (Gossip Girl's Blake Lively) has travelled to Mexico to find a secluded beach to surf, she wants to find the beach that her mother, who recently passed away, found out she was pregnant with Nancy on. Friendly local resident Carlos (Óscar Jaenada) drives her to this beach, soon after arriving she is joined by two other local residents (Angelo José Lozano Corzo and José Manuel Trujillo Salas), and the three of them surf for several hours. Nancy takes a break from surfing to video chat with her sister Chloe (Sedona Legge) and father (Brett Cullen), the conversation about her mother gets her emotional, Nancy hangs up and decides to catch one more late afternoon wave before heading back to her hotel. While waiting for a wave, Nancy the carcass of a large humpback whale floating, then while riding her last wave her surf board is bumped by a large Great White Shark, she falls into the water and hits her head on a submerged rock. As Nancy surfaces, the shark bites her leg, pulling her under, but she gets away and swims onto the whale carcass, she stays there for a few, before swimming to a nearby isolated rock, and improvises a bandage using her surfboard strap and the sleeve of her wet suit to stop the bleeding. The two locals leave, unaware of Nancy's situation, forcing her to spend the night on the rock, with an injured seagull she names ""Steven"" (after Steven Seagal). The next morning, a drunk local man (Diego Espejel) is on the beach, Nancy gets his attention, but instead of helping her he steals her money, phone and backpack, and when he tries to retrieve her surfboard he ends up torn apart by the shark. Several hours later, the two surfers have returned, they get into the water before Nancy can warn them, the shark kills them, but Nancy is able to retrieve the GoPro camera helmet from one of the men, she records a message for her father and sister, and throws the helmet towards the shore. High tide is approaching and the rock Nancy is on will be submerged, she is able to time the shark's circling from the whale carcass to the rock, she manages to swim to the nearby buoy, through a group of jellyfish, which sting both her and the shark. On the buoy Nancy finds a flare gun, but she fails to get the attention of a passing cargo ship, she fires at the shark, which catches fire from the floating whale blubber, the shark dives to stop being badly burned. The shark then starts furiously attacking the buoy, ripping the chains securing it to the ocean bed, Nancy grabs the last remaining chain as it is ripped and she is violently pulled down, the shark chases her down at high speed, but she pulls out at the last minute, the shark impales itself on metal wreckage sprouting from the buoy's concrete anchor. The GoPro camera is found near the shore by Carlos' son (Pablo Calva), who brings his father to the beach, Carlos finds Nancy floating in the shallows, she is relieved to be rescued, and see Steven Seagull has made it to shore. One year later, Nancy has recovered, with a large scar on her leg, she is surfing in Galveston, Texas with Chloe and her father. Also starring Janelle Bailey as Mom, Ava Dean as Young Nancy and Chelsea Moody as Young Mom. Lively who has to carry almost the whole film alone does pretty well as the innocent girl trying to survive, it does use the elements we've come to expect from Jaws, but there is the right amount of uncomfortable bloody bits and tension, good editing and cinematography, and you do root for the heroine to survive against the monster, a cleverly constructed and enjoyable survival horror thriller. Worth watching!",The Shallows
8,Woodyanders,Surfer gal versus shark,8,15 January 2020,"Surfer and medical school dropout Nancy (a strong and sympathetic portrayal by Blake Lively) finds herself stranded in the ocean with a hungry and relentless great white shark. She's 200 yards from the shore of a secluded beach and has no one but herself to rely on.Director Jaume Collet-Serra relates the tight and gripping story at a constant pace, stages the harrowing shark attack scenes with ferocious flair, and generates a tremendous amount of nerve-ratting tension. More importantly, Collet-Serra, screenwriter Anthony Jaswinski, and Lively all do an ace job of making Nancy a character who the viewer truly cares about as she uses a mixture of wits, strength, and courage to figure out a way to surmount her seemingly impossible situation. Flavio Martinez Labiano's sumptuous widescreen cinematography not only astutely captures the awesome beauty and danger of nature (the aerial shots of the beach are especially breathtaking), but also vividly depicts the sheer raw and brutal desperation of Nancy's terrifying predicament. Extras kudos are in order for the adorable seagull that becomes Nancy's fellow companion in peril. Granted, things get more than a tad absurd towards the end and the CGI shark looks a bit hokey at times, but overall it's an extremely intense and effective little nail-biter.",The Shallows
9,ma-cortes,Taut and bone-chilling thriller in which the constant shark attacks deliver the goods.,7,25 July 2021,"In this The Shallows 2016 director Jordi Collet Serra provides a moving creation of tension, thrills, terror , emotions and brief gore. In this thrilling and intriguing movie , shark attacks images deliver excitement enough , accompanying a stirring musical score by Marco Beltrani who heightens the suspense. When Nancy (Blake Lively) is surfing on a secluded beach, she finds herself on the feeding ground of a great white shark. Though she is stranded only 200 yards from shore , survival proves to be the ultimate test of wills , requiring all of Nancy's ingenuity , resourcefulness , and fortitude . Was once in the deep is now in the shallows . Plan your getaway . Not just another day at the beach.A suspenseful film about a beautiful girl , a brave surfer , as mere 200 yards from shore, Nancy/Blake Lively is attacked by a great white shark, with her short journey to safety becoming the ultimate contest of wills . The film does finally get moving in the last 35 or so minutes, and it's in those moments that make the picture overall effective to be. Jordi Collet knows how to milk tension into these scenes and doesn't disappoint . The finale is particularly an exercise in creating seat-gripping suspense . It's almost a match for the conclusion to classic Jaws film . The showdown between Nancy and the shark is just as memorable and on the edge-of-the-seat , as her confrontation bears remarkable resemblance with the other great white in the Spielberg's summer blockbuster . Marco Beltrani's score is as effective as ever and serves to heighten the tension factor by a notch. Here the man-eater finds another victim , a gorgeous woman , facing another toothy terror with an equally voracious appetite . Although there's very little in the way of originality in the issues already treated in previous films , this competent story being some more than a mechanical rehash of former elements , as it still has enough bite to make it a fun flick . Admittedly, filmmaker Jordi Collet is no Spielberg, and his handling of the film's scenes of family drama is less than scintillating, but he rises to the challenge when required to deliver suspense and action, with plenty of well crafted and shocking shark attacks guaranteed to have the audience jumping out of their seats in fear movie with scary scenes . Displaying competent direction and containing similar plot to other films , taking parts of Jaws or Castaway . Stars Blake Lively giving a top-notch acting , accompanied by brief interpretations from Oscar Jaenada as a tourist guide and Brett Cullen as her beloved daddy.It packs colorful and shimmering cinematography by cameraman Flavio Martinez Labiano , shot on location in Lord Howe Island, New South Wales, and Mount Tamborine, Queensland, Australia , as well as using green screens , at times . The musician Marco Beltrani composes a moving and rousing musical score fitting perfectly to the frenetic action . The motion picture was well produced and directed by Jaume Collet-Serra , though it has similarities with others films formerly realized and pacing could have been more tight , but it's often suspenseful and exciting. This Spanish filmmaker is an expert director of terror movies as ""Orphan"" , ""House of Wax"" and ""The River"" series , as well as specialist in thrillers , most of them starred by Liam Neeson as ""Unknown"" , ""Run all night"" and ""Non-stop"" and ""The Commuter"" . Rating : 7/10 . Better than average . Essential and indispensable watching for Blake Lively fans and sea thriller enthusiasts.",The Shallows
10,BA_Harrison,Surf babe vs big fish.,6,11 May 2017,"Nancy (Blake Lively) hitches a lift to a remote beach paradise in Mexico to surf the gnarly waves, unaware that the waters are the feeding ground for a bloody big and very hungry shark. As she is waiting to catch one last ride, the shark knocks her into the water and has a little nibble on her leg (given the size of the shark, I'd say that she is lucky she wasn't swallowed whole). Bleeding, Nancy is able to climb to safety, first on the carcass of a dead whale, and then onto some rocks, but trapped 200 metres from the shore, can she make it back to dry land without becoming fish food?The best shark film since Jaws? No, not by a long chalk. There's too much pointless surfing at beginning, too much cell phone messaging (great connection considering the remoteness of Nancy's location), too much of very little happening on the rock, too many plot contrivances (necklace, jellyfish, shark tooth, flare gun) and an ending that really stretches plausibility. The film does, however, benefit from a strong central performance from Lively, some lovely cinematography (of both the beach and the star's body), and one or two well-handled moments of tension by director Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax and Orphan). As for the shark, it looks convincing when it's in the water, but the CGI isn't quite up to par once the fish decides to leap out of the water to chew on a metal buoy (don't ask).Jaws is still the best shark film ever made, and there are plenty better than The Shallows, but, hey, I didn't hate it. Which is something, I suppose.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",The Shallows
11,paul_haakonsen,"Good enough entertainment, but awfully predictable...",4,10 September 2016,"The first thing that came to mind after having seen ""The Shallows"" was that it has nothing on ""Jaws"", not by a long shot. But then again, I can't really claim to have had much expectations to a movie which is centered on a woman trapped on a small rock with a shark circling around.As for the story, well I have essentially just summarized the entire movie above. But for clarification, ""The Shallows"" is about Nancy (played by Blake Lively) who is out surfing at a secluded beach. She stumbles upon a dead whale and finds herself in waters where a great white shark hunts. Trapped on a small rock, Nancy is in deep trouble as the high tide and the ferocious shark both are against her.Right, well the idea was good on paper, but transcribed to a movie, well it just wasn't as entertaining as it could have been. Why? Well, because it was just awfully predictable. You knew what was happening way before it happened on the screen, and the audience were always two steps ahead of the movie. And while the shark was amazingly well brought to life on the screen, then it's behavior was just ridiculous.As I just said, then the shark was really nicely made, it was quite realistic and the CGI were really believable. The CGI team managed to make a very deadly predator here and they brought it to the screen in an amazing way.The beach must be having its own very unique system of how waves work, because at one moment there were massive waves rolling in, and then the second the water was almost still like a pond. That didn't make much sense that the waves were rather big and rolling one moment, and then completely gone the next.As for the bird co-star of the movie. While it didn't really do much, it was a nice and fun touch to the movie. Especially how it managed to sneak into most shots on the rock. And who doesn't love a sea gull that photobombs while a video is being recorded?The acting in ""The Shallows"" was adequate, especially with the little ensemble of actors and actresses in the movie. Blake Lively performed well, despite having a limited script to work with. Personally I didn't understand why the Nancy character had to talk to herself throughout the movie, but I guess otherwise it would be a very quiet movie.While ""The Shallows"" was entertaining enough, it just suffered terribly under its predictability, and that was a killer - no pun intended - for me, and I ended up on rating ""The Shallows"" four out of ten stars.",The Shallows
12,Quinoa1984,"a shark attack thriller cooked better than most, with a few flaws",7,24 June 2016,"Here's the thing: shark movies are like chicken nuggets. Ever since Steven Chefberg directed Jaws and delivered to the world the ultimate delicacy - like getting chicken nuggets cooked by the top folks at Tavern on the Green or something - there's been a steady diet of crap nuggets, and I don't just mean McDonald's, I'm talking about the tiny McDonald's nestled in the most crime-and-poverty filled portion of a major city with workers who haven't been paid a decent wage in 30 years. In other words, so many shark movies suck or, at best, try to make themselves parodies of sucky movies (which may end up sucking anyway) like the Sharknado movies. So when one finally is cooked up like this (ie Chik-fil-A) and filmmakers get something made with some competency and attention to suspense and gives an actress the total show it impresses. But if it's a chicken nugget from Chik-fil-A, isn't it still fast-food?OK, enough cheesy critic-metaphor. Simply put, this isn't the best shark movie since Jaws, not close. But since Open Water? Sure, I'll bite, no pun intended. What director Jaume Collet-Sera does, from a script by Anthony Jaswinski, is take a semi-Cast Away approach to the shark movie. We get a surfer in Nancy (Blake Lively) who as ""movie-luck"" has it (when the time comes) has medical school experience (though, as we're told through conversation-exposition early on, didn't finish), but as luck wouldn't have it she is basically the only one left at a so-called ""secret"" beach - she never even finds out the name, darn it - and there's a shark prowling in the shallow part of the waters. She finds a modicum of shelter on a tiny rock, has to do her best to heal a bitten-into knee, and figure out just what the hell to do from here. Swim to shore? Fat chance.In the sense of isolation I'm reminded of Open Water, but that was differentiated by being a bunch of sharks. The Shallows brings us to having just one, and it's one of those Megaton Will Kill Anything That Moves sharks that Jaws etched into people's minds and has been ripped off ever since. One of the things I appreciate about this approach is that the threat is real for Nancy but it's not something that is too unbelievable; she gets bitten, but it's not fatal (at least, not for someone who, yes, conveniently, knows what she's doing to heal herself). Other movies make it seem like a shark eats everything right away, but often when people get bit in real life it's more traumatic and dangerous by having just one limb or something like it as the injury. When the filmmakers make it all about the step-by-step telling of what this woman will do, or try to do, or won't be able to do, it fires on all cylinders and Caulet-Serra and Lively make a strong collaboration in showing this woman's fight for survival.The issues for me come with certain parts being silly, and the tone is a bit like whiplash; one moment may show the CGI shark jumping in the air and getting an unsuspecting surfer in its grasp (or, more specifically, when s*** finally gets real in the last ten minutes and it takes a final turn that had me laughing, uncontrollably), and then another moment will show a difficult decision Nancy has to make, like having to swim through a pocket of jellyfish to get a head-star, and it becomes far more nerve-wracking due to this being more relatable as a real threat (at least for me, having encountered this in going in the ocean more than sharks).There's even one point a character who, believably or not, does something on the beach that straddles the line of being a serious ""oh, come on!"" dramatic moment and being funny. But a lot of this in the Shallows does come together into a cohesive whole: Collet-Sera may like his slow-motion shots (or Snyder-esque slow-to-fast-to-normal speeds) with surfing and some tense moments, and yet for little aesthetic tics that don't work he has Lively at the center and gets to create real suspense and real terror out of what could be just a situation. It's more than that, and I appreciated it being focused when it needed to be and only going for the occasional cheese, not the full block of it, to bring it back to food metaphors again.",The Shallows
13,Coventry,"O-oh, digital shark attack!",5,13 September 2019,"Without over-engineering things, let's roughly assume there exist four categories of shark movies. Steven Spielberg's 1975 hit ""Jaws"" forms a league of its own; - there's hardly any discussion there. The second category, admittedly a guilty-pleasure group of mine, contains all those delightful knock-offs of the late '70s and 80s, like ""Great White"", ""Mako: The Jaws of Death"", ""Tintorera!"", ""Cyclone"" and even the official ""Jaws"" sequels. I'll skip the third category for a moment and simply state clear - for the record - that the fourth and final category exclusively contains the numerous dim-witted and infuriatingly horrendous OTT shark-comedies (like ""Sharknado"", ""2-Headed Shark Attack"", ""Avalanche Sharks"", ""Sand Sharks"", ...)Coming back to the third category, this one contains, in my humble opinion the ""Yeah... but no"" efforts. I'm convinced these shark movies were made with the best of intentions, and most of them even are even enjoyable to watch, but none of them hold any potential to ever became great genre classics. There are plenty of titles here as well, like ""Shark Night"", ""The Reef"", ""The Meg"", ""Open Water"", ""Bait"", ""Dark Tide"", ""Red Water"", and I'm even willing to include ""Deep Blue See"" and ""Shark Attack"". Even though it received several good reviews and a relatively high score here on IMDb, ""The Shallows"" pretty much also sits in this category.""The Shallows"" is a so-called minimalist thriller, meaning it has a very small number of characters and a straightforward plot that can be summarized in one sentence. Nancy, a medicine student struggling with the choices for her future, has finally found the secluded Mexican beach where her beloved late mother went to surf. When night falls, she accidentally disturbs a great white shark during his whale carcass buffet and the massive animal promptly attacks her. With a severe leg injury, Nancy is trapped on a rock, barely 200 yards removed from a safe beach she cannot reach. Blake Lively's performance is forceful and director Jaume Collet-Serra (""Orphan"") establishes a handful of notably intense and atmospheric moments. Unfortunately, the entire production is rather, well, shallow itself. Nobody would ever doubt if Nancy survives the ordeal, whereas the Mexican surfer machos are guaranteed to become shark snacks. The predictability of the plot is still acceptable, but it's most regretful that every special effect (the shark, the whale, the jellyfish, ...) is computer engineered again.",The Shallows
14,bevo-13678,Jaws is better,10,10 August 2021,The shark should have just eaten her in the first 5 minutes. I didn't even watch the whole thing to see if she died or not.,The Shallows
15,Hey_Sweden,Gripping most of the way.,7,2 October 2020,"Minimalist storytelling gets a workout here, as we follow one character in a spooky life-or-death situation. Blake Lively is Nancy, a surfer who ventures to a secluded beach once favoured by her (deceased) mom. It isn't long before she realizes that the waters are the feeding ground of a particularly relentless great white shark. For much of the running time, Nancy is stranded on a rock outcropping roughly 200 yards from shore. She will have to save her own butt since help will prove to be a very hard thing to come by.Written by Anthony Jaswinski, and directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (the director of ""Orphan"" and the ""House of Wax"" remake), this is generally entertaining stuff. Lively is good enough an actress to have us rooting for her throughout, and wincing when she has to tend to her wounds. (Conveniently, the character has medical training, and the means to do an impromptu job of sewing.) Lively is the main reason to watch, as she fights and fights mightily to survive. Although Collet-Serra is able to deliver some tension and thrills, it's Lively that helps the movie through its sillier and more unbelievable moments (such as the ultimate means of dispatching the beast).The minimum of locations used creates a very intimate feel, there's a rather endearing (and obviously well-trained) seagull that hangs around and becomes something of a companion for Nancy, the music is appropriate, and the picture is very well shot in widescreen by Flavio Martinez Labiano. The pacing is fine, resulting in a movie a few minutes shy of an hour and a half. The mostly digital effects are tolerable.While a far cry from the masterwork that was ""Jaws"", the high water mark for the entire shark film genre, this has certainly got to rank as better than some of the ultra-cheesy finned predator cinema that is out there.Seven out of 10.",The Shallows

17,zardoz-13,Munch Ado About Something!!!,8,28 June 2016,"Spanish helmer Jaume Collet-Serra, who directed Liam Neeson in ""Unknown,"" ""Non-Stop,"" ""Run All Night,"" and has plans for another film with Neeson entitled ""The Commuter,"" must have felt that pitting his favorite Irish actor against a ferocious Great White shark would be unfair to it. Instead, Collet-Serra has ""Age of Adaline"" actress Blake Lively contend with this colossal Carcharodon carcharias in ""The Shallows,"" an entertaining, often suspenseful, but largely improbable B-movie survivalist saga. Summer movies are typically sprawling, impersonal, and larger-than-life blockbusters, about clashes between titans and extraterrestrials, such as ""Captain America: Civil War,"" ""X-Men: Apocalypse,"" ""Independence Day: Resurgence,"" ""Warcraft,"" and ""Teenage Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows."" Although Collet-Serra's film boasts a pugnacious predator roughly the size of a medium class submarine, ""The Shallows"" remains more personal in scope than traditional summer fare. The exploits depicted in this Sony/Columbia Pictures release do not pose a threat to civilization as we know it. Indeed, the events occur in relative anonymity without television networks broadcasting them as they unfold. Ultimately, nobody knows what is happening until the action concludes. Aside from Blake Lively, ""The Shallows"" features only seven actors, six relatively unknown males and one female confined to supporting roles. Not only does Lively play a sympathetic character, but also you cannot take your eyes off her while she is locked into life-and-death combat with a tenaciously toothy terrornaut that doesn't know when to quit. Comparably, ""The Shallows"" reminded me of the grim finale in Ridley Scott's classic, 1979, sci-fi shocker ""Alien."" Virtually the entire crew of the ill-fated, space merchant vessel Nostromo had died in a fight with an indestructible space monster whose blood was as corrosive as acid. The last survivor, sexy Sigourney Weaver, had slipped into something comfort to go to sleep for the long voyage home when she discovered to her horror that she was sharing her escape spacecraft with that fearsome fiend. Similarly, after about fifteen minutes of watching shapely Blake arrive at a remote stretch of scenic beach, strip down to a bikini, and plunge into the bay for a little surfing, the infamous shark shows up without fanfare and turns out to be quite the scene stealer for the remaining 87 white-knuckled minutes. Essentially, what Jaswinski and Collet-Serra have wrought amounts to a synthesis of ""Jaws,"" ""Blue Crush,"" and ""Soul Surfer."" Nancy Adams (Blake Lively of ""Savages"") has just withdrawn from nursing school. The gruesome experience of watching her long suffering mother succumb to cancer has devastated her. Nancy just wants to retreat and ponder her future. She remembers her pregnant mother told her about a secret stretch of beach in Mexico that she had gone to while she was carrying her. A friendly native gives her a lift in his battered pick-up truck through the jungle to the beach, and the beach looks like a dream with its azure skies, creamy surf, and faraway islands forming a barrier against the ocean. Initially, Nancy came with a girlfriend, but her girlfriend left her for a cute guy. Alone but content, Nancy swims out into the secluded bay and encounters two other surfer guys. Their English is as insufficient as her Spanish, and they share some waves before they leave. Later, Nancy spots a gigantic rotting whale carcass and investigates it before making her final surf for the day. As she is riding the crest of a wave, a Great White shark smashes into her and knocks her off her surfboard. The shark chomps on her left thigh, but Nancy finds sanctuary on a small outcropping of rock fewer than 200 yards from shore. The sinister shark cruises in circles around her like a war party of Apaches rampaging around a wagon train of pioneers in the Old West. Nancy uses pieces of jewelry to stitch up her chewed up thigh, but she fears the onset of gangrene if she isn't rescued soon.Talk about a tight-spot! ""The Shallows"" never wears out its welcome. ""Kristy"" scenarist Anthony Jaswinski and Collet-Serra observe all the standard conventions of vintage suspense thrillers. They corner our valiant heroine in one frightening predicament after another, and she must rely on her own savvy and stamina. Occasionally, when Nancy cannot outwit her adversary, the filmmakers create obstacles that the shark cannot overcome in its ravenous lust to make her into mincemeat. At one point, a steel hook embedded in its jaw gets snagged on a buoy, and the Great White wallows turbulently before it dislodges itself and renews its attack. At other times, the shark deals with marine life such as a school of jelly fish and the craggy underwater terrain that thwarts its momentum. The irony is that our heroine is--as the title indicates-- in shallow waters instead of far out in the briny blue deep. The Great White shark appears sufficiently menacing, and computer-generated visual effects are top-notch. The predator's initial appearance through a wave is ominously dramatic. If you've seen the trailer, the scene where the Great White lurches above the waves to gobble a surfer is sensational stuff. The whale carcass that our heroine initially takes refuge on until the shark forces her to abandon it looks pretty realistic, too. The shift into tone and atmosphere from harmony to heartache for Nancy is very palatable, too. Although this woman-in-jeopardy nail-biter is set Mexico, the filmmakers wound up lensing it on location in sunny Australia. Mind you, ""The Shallows"" doesn't surpass Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"" with its atmospheric music and ensemble male cast. In a scene reminiscent of the ""Jaws"" finale when Roy Schneider fires a rifle at the shark that kills it, our heroine appropriates a flare pistol and fires it at the marauding shark. Characterization remains on the lean side since Blake Lively's solitary surfer is the only three dimensional character on display. Nevertheless, just as ""Jaws"" exploited our anxieties about splashing about the sea without a second thought, ""The Shallows"" may make you think twice about wading into surf.",The Shallows

While surfing she is attacked by a large shark, leaving her injured and stranded on a rock not too far out to sea. What follows is a battle of wits and wills between her and the shark.Quite a basic plot line, yet filled with much intrigue and tension. Initially reminded me of Open Water, but follows a different course, from a point. While both have a survival vs sharks central plot, Open Water had much more character depth, adding another dimension to the movie. The Shallows is purely about survival, and what that entails.",The Shallows

You see, THE SHALLOWS was released by the propaganda arm of the Japanese government, Sony Pictures. It's carefully crafted to make ALL Americans as terrified of ANY sea critter and in favor of totally sterile tsunami trash dump radioactive oceans as ""Nancy,"" who's bedeviled by a completely implausible shark, harassed by a sea gull, stung by jellyfish, and barfs up a crab during her time on screen. One has to admit that THE SHALLOWS is very effective at accomplishing Japan\Sony's nefarious goal, but so was the late film director Leni Riefenstahl in promoting Adolph Hitler as an All-Around Good Guy in her 1930s flick, TRIUMPH OF THE WILL. Hopefully, Sony's TRIUMPH will be short-lived, if more films such as THE COVE come out to document Japan's on-going Holocaust being waged against this world's friendly Flippers and our other Friends of the Deeps. If you have a mind strong enough to withstand media manipulation by the strongest Disinformation Service on Earth, go ahead and wade in THE SHALLOWS at your own risk.",The Shallows

22,neil-476,"Good, with an element of dumb",7,23 May 2018,"Nancy, struggling with life choices following her mother's death, drops out of medical school and goes surfing, finding by chance the idyllic and undiscovered Mexican beach her mother so loved when she was carrying Nancy. The surfing is great. Unfortunately an enormous shark hangs out in the bay and, having killed a humpback whale, it has a go at Nancy who, despite being badly bitten on the leg, manages to heave herself onto a rock. However, the rock will disappear at high tide. Can she make it to the nearby buoy before the shark catches her?This simple, and fairly short, story of survival is lovely to look at (not least because Blake Lively, especially in swimwear, is easy on the eye). Given the claustrophobic and limited setting - a rock, a buoy, a beach, a shark - it manages to remain suspenseful for well over an hour, and you are never sure whether Nancy will make it or not: the ""giveaway"" at the start is, you come to realise, no such thing.The shark is digital and makes you wonder what Spielberg would have given for CGI when he was making Jaws - none of that messing around with Bruce breaking down!Conversely, the filmmakers here have pretty much ignored the trouble Spielberg took to make sure of consistency with sea and weather conditions - the sea varies from huge waves to pancake smooth in consecutive shots.
In fact, the biggest problem I had with the film was that sort of lack of attention to detail. The timetable of the tides is quite crucial, for instance, and given to the audience quite specifically so that they understand Nancy's jeopardy as the tide rises, yet the exposure of the rock is often completely inconsistent with the state of the tide.And - I'm terribly sorry - sharks don't behave like that. This one is worse than the one in Jaws for bearing grudges. And why it is hanging around for a bit of sweet Lively thigh when there is an enormous whale carcass floating 100 yards away, I don't know. OK, I'd go for Blake Lively's thigh in preference to a rotting whale any day of the week, but I'm not a shark. Plus why is there a buoy in the middle of a bay where no-one goes, apparently marking nothing in particular. I accept it's handy to have one there when the rock you're perched on is about to disappear under the waves, but still...",The Shallows
23,anaconda-40658,Best Shark Film Since Jaws.,8,4 July 2016,"The Shallows (2016): Dir: Jaume Collet-Serra / Cast: Blake Lively, Oscar Jaenada, Lozano Corzo, Jose Manuel, Diego Espejel: Easily the best shark thriller since Jaws. The title seems to symbolize decisions as in the ones going through that of Nancy when she isolates herself through surfing. She left the medical field when her mother died. Her father is frustrated in his attempts to convince her not to quit. Her younger sister looks up to her and desires to follow her in surfing. Her new found freedom leads to a whale carcass and that discovery leads to a shark attack that leaves a massive gash in her leg. She crawls upon a rock with a wounded seagull. Her world seems hopeless as the water gets higher. Her attempts to flags down a drunken guy on the shore ends with him being bitten in half. Two other surfers also end up as shark chow. These characters are flat with the exception of Nancy and Blake Lively plays her as risky yet intelligent. She is determined to survive and is involved in a gruelling climax where she realizes that she must kill the shark. This is director Jaume Collet-Serra's best work. The tension is real and the action is fast and swift. Its only drawback in comparison to Jaws is its lack of rounded characters. This gives Lively a grand opportunity to take centre stage as an actress since roles for women are far and few between. She proves resourceful when time is crucial. Its theme regards a tragedy that steers us back towards what we should be and where our true value lies. Then there is our passions such as surfing...but one can do without the shark.

24,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Stellar and highly enjoyable killer shark film,9,7 August 2018,"Taking a trip to a secluded beach, a woman intending to surf in the area where her and her mother surfed years earlier is attacked by a shark prowling the area and tries to survive the encounter long enough to get help as her limited supplies and slowly slipping conscious derail her chances.This one was quite the enjoyable and somewhat thrilling effort. Most of what works here with this one is the fact that it takes quite a bit of suspense from the situation that comes naturally in such a situation. This type of setup is one of the more realistic and believable type of situations for a shark attack where it occurs in a secluded area involving a lone shark in an area targeting other factors around the environment and only just turning the attention to the surfer only by proxy. The behavior of the creature, seemingly more interested in the free meal around it than spending it dealing with her and only turning its attention to her once she gets into the water because of the cuts she has, comes off as incredibly realistic and seemingly in tune with how such creatures behave in real life. This in turns gives the suspense of the few attack scenes quite a bit of power as they carry themselves out. The initial attack out on the middle of her surf into shore is quite nice due to the obvious shots of it stalking her from the beginning and it strikes at a truly unexpected time leaving this with quite a nice surprise. The series of attacks in the water as she tries to survive are incredibly thrilling, using the shrinking location and the continuous onslaught of the creatures' appearances to stellar effect as her worsening physical condition makes for a fantastic counter to the rest of the situation. The finale on the buoy is stellar as well, giving this a nice action quotient and a rousing finale that's perfect for this kind of effort, and alongside the great prop shark that's involved here really holds this one up over its minor flaws. About the only real factor involved in knocking this one down is the utterly severe amount of injuries inflicted here that don't really make any kind of sense as to why she's still able to fight back. It's quite obvious that the initial wound is quite striking and severe, but to then feature the bruising across the body from the rock sanctuary, the multitude of cuts and scrapes trying to get to safety or the series of crashes and cuts while fighting the shark off at the buoy that cause her plenty of additional bloodless alongside what she's already gone through. This just doesn't look logical at all and is the real negative force holding this one back which isn't really all that detrimental at all.Rated PG-13: Violence and Language.",The Shallows
25,FlashCallahan,Are you ready to get wet?........,8,4 July 2016,"Young surfer Nancy travels to a secluded beach in search of a secret spot that her mother had discovered years earlier. While paddling out into the waves, she is hunted by a great white shark and stranded on an embankment away from the shoreline. Alone and wounded, she attempts to survive the attack and get ashore by means possible, but such a short distance seems like a lifetime away......Many have said that this is this generations Jaws. Not its not, Jaws is this generations Jaws, and the next and the next, as Jaws is a timeless classic.Now, while this isn't of the same calibre as Spielberg's groundbreaking masterpiece, it's easily the best Shark attack film since Jaws, and will inject that same fear as Jaws does, every time you step into the ocean.It's a simple premise, Livlely gets bitten by a shark, finds refuge on a small rock, but the shark doesn't want just a small bite, he wants the whole Nancy, and to be fair, can you really blame the shark?Lively is wonderful as Nancy, almost channelling Hanks in Castaway, by making friends with a Seagull, and distracting herself by talking all things medicine.And it's a solid movie, short, scary, and featuring every trope you could think of in a film of this kind. The friendly surfers, shouting helplessly, the abhorrent passer by, and of course, the over the top final act.And this is what stops it from being one of the most exciting films of the year, because in an instant, it turns from a realistic, Open Water type film, to Deep Blue Sea, and although the it's an exciting finale, it takes away any sense of realism or danger that Nancy has.But other than that, it's an exciting time at the movies, and if you are travelling anywhere with an ocean view, I urge you to see this before.Obviously would make a great quad bill with Jaws, Open Water, and then Jaws:The Revenge, just to clear your head of all the serious sharks.",The Shallows

The camera work both above and below the water is amazingly good - clear and slows down when it needs to. There is a variety of situations so things don't get repetitive. The plot is kept believable and it's exciting scary and entertaining. Way above the cheesy movies we have had since Jaws.Blake Lively is likable, beautiful and believable as a surfer. She acts well and her pain becomes the viewer's pain. Can almost feel her ordeal as I winced every time she got her cuts and scratches.

28,zetes,"Starts off great, but unfortunately can't keep it up until the end",6,26 June 2016,"A decent little one-location thriller, but it's one I wish were just a little better than it is. Blake Lively plays a surfer who gets stranded on a tiny island that will be gone as soon as high tide comes in. Circling around her is a massive great white shark, which has already made a nice gash on her leg. This starts off excellently, with some truly awesome surfing footage and beautiful cinematography. The set-up is chilling, and the shark is nice and menacing - that is until we start seeing it a lot. As the film goes on, it can't help but give us a lot of shark. I don't mind the couple of aerial shots where we see the behemoth in its shadowy, underwater form. Sure, it's ridiculously huge there, whether from the refraction of the water or just exaggerated from Lively's perspective. No, we start to descend underwater and we get plenty of clear views of a CGI shark that doesn't really move like a real shark (it never really behaves like one - one wonders why it wants Lively so bad when it has an entire, bloated, dead whale not putting up any fight just a stone's throw away). What harms the film too much for me is the climax, which is eye-rollingly silly. I also could have done without the sequence with the cartoonish borracho, too. It felt like that was added late to extend the runtime a smidge.",The Shallows
29,trashgang,excellent,8,30 July 2016,"I was afraid to watch this not for the horror or for the shark but people out there please admit it, there hasn't been a shark movie after Jaws (1975) that looked marvelous and has that creepy feeling like Jaws. Most of them were over the top regarding the shark. What we have here is the fight of human against shark and it do has the creepiness of Jaws. The way it was shot looked great, the use of picture in picture when using the phone or the underwater shots in slo-mo when they hit the wave boarding it all looks great. And even as it took a while before the disaster comes in it all worked out fine. It's really after a while one person (Blake Lively) against the monster. And knowing that the tide comes in is the main reason what makes this flick a suspenseful flick.The effects are really great, all fish looks like the real stuff, the shark attacks do look like the shark from Jaws and the wounds on Blake also looked real, yes, this one I did like.

That story was also a bit deeper then The Shallows. There you got the suspense because it was all not done before plus the story was just better. I don't say The Shallows isn't an okay movie or so, but if you saw Jaws before then you realize this one doesn't come near to it. Then again there is not much you can do with a story of a shark attacking surfers. It is what it is and besides a couple good nature scenes, a bit of good CGI's,a bikini babe here or there is all you can do to keep the masses interested. So the story is just what I expected it to be, surfers being attacked and someone trying to survive and trying to get help. Blake Lively does her best but there is not much to do to make a movie like this great. And I sincerely doubt there will ever be a shark movie in the future that will have high ratings. The Shallows is okay to watch once and then forget about it.",The Shallows
31,JamesHitchcock,Suspense in its Purest Form,7,9 September 2019,"While surfing from a remote Mexican beach a young woman named Nancy Adams is attacked by a shark. She manages to swim to an isolated rock about 200 yards offshore, but cannot make it back to the beach. To make matters worse, the rock is regularly submerged at high tide.And that, in a nutshell, is the plot of ""The Shallows"". This is essentially suspense film making in its purest, most simplified form. No subplots. No detailed character analysis or development. Little dialogue. One sole location (apart from the final scene). An adversary who has no complicated psychological motives, only blind killer instincts. This being a suspense thriller there have to be a few false hopes of rescue first raised and then dashed, otherwise the film would have been over in about half an hour.The nearest the plot comes to complexity is when it explains something of Nancy's back-story. We learn that she was a medical student but dropped out of medical school after being traumatised by the recent death of her mother. (Her medical training has some relevance to the plot as it explains how she is able to treat her own injuries). The reason why Nancy chose this particular beach is because her mother visited it while pregnant with her. We also learn that Nancy has a father and a younger sister, Chloe, back in Galveston, Texas.This is, of course, a one-woman film. Blake Lively who plays Nancy is on screen virtually the whole time; no other character plays anything like a major role. Well, no other human character. The second most important character is the shark itself and the third most important a seagull whom Nancy names ""Steven"". Steven Seagull (geddit?) is also injured by the shark and is the nearest thing Nancy has to a companion during her ordeal. I would agree with the critic who described Lively's performance as being ""as much an athletic feat as an aesthetic one"", as this is a film which depends upon its action sequences for its effect. Some people have described the efforts to provide Nancy with a back-story as unnecessary, on the grounds that in a battle between girl and shark the audience are always going to root for the girl even if she is an escaped convict rather than an aspiring doctor. I think, however, that the film-makers were right to provide their heroine with an identity and a life and thus establish her as an individual with whom we can identify rather than a mere plot device.In a sense the title of ""The Shallows"" is an apt one; there is little that is deep or significant about it, but then the film-makers never set out to make a deeply significant meaning-of-life movie. They set out to make a gripping thriller which would hold our attention for an hour-and-a-half, and in this we can say that they succeeded. 7/10A goof. The film is supposedly set in Mexico, but Steven Seagull is a silver gull, a species native to Australia and not found in Mexico. The reason is that, despite its ostensible setting, the film was shot on location in Australia.",The Shallows

And the sea sure is full of jellyfish, dolphins, and other sea creatures yet most of all the murky waters inhabit the big great white! Soon others swimmers leave and Nancy finds herself all alone and matters become more complex when she's stuck on an island beach type rock that's 200 yards away from the shore.""The Shallows"" then takes a journey of the will to live it's clearly a game about endurance and mental smarts and the wit and the need for escape as it's a game of cat of mouse between Nancy and the great white.

On the surface it's like a generic shark attack movie that takes on a serious approach. And when it comes down to it, it's a simple survival movie where the protagonist has to use all her wits, resources and ingenuity in order to survive. But the parts about the lead's will to survive and her transition as a character is what makes this one stand out for a B movie. At the start she is a very pessimistic character that doesn't believe in the point of trying if the odds are against her. Mainly because of her mother's death.

You could feel Nancy's pain as she deals with her injury and her determination as she makes all kind of enduring attempts to survive. The lingering shark circling in the waters around her gives the dramatic mood added suspense, and the injured seagull marooned with Nancy on the island gives the film some added lightheartedness.The visual effects were great as it paints a picture of a beach out in the middle of nowhere and isolation, and the CGI-shark was actually realistic-looking.Though the shark is only on screen for a few minutes, its presence is felt throughout the film, while Nancy's riveting quest for survival is the highlight of the film.

36,sddavis63,A Decent Shark Movie,7,30 June 2018,"The opening few minutes of this film give us a bit of a back story about Nancy (Blake Lively) - who's come on a trip to a beach she used to come to with her late mother in an attempt apparently to pull herself together after her mother's death. That wasn't too long (too much examination of a character's backstory can be tedious) and so it served its purpose. After that, once Nancy gets to the beach we have some really good surfing footage as Nancy and a couple of locals are out on the waves enjoying themselves. Then comes the problem - her two surfing buddies leave while Nancy goes back out to catch one last wave as she says. Instead of a wave, she encounters a shark. Bitten and bleeding, she finds ""safety"" safety on an island that's not much more than a rock and that will likely disappear when the tide comes in - and there's no one around to rescue her.I will say that Lively was pretty good. I haven't really seen much of her and nothing she's done stands out for me. But she managed to carry this pretty well. Nancy was, for the most part, the only character in the movie, and Lively was able to make her plight interesting and realistic. I was impressed with her. Having said that, with so much of the movie set on Nancy's plight on the rock, this does get a bit tiresome after a while, because there's only so much that can be done in that setting. But still, you do sympathize with Nancy. Obviously, the movie leads up to the ultimate confrontation between Nancy and the shark, which turns out to be somewhat implausible.As shark movies go - and there seem to have been a lot of them lately, including the approximately 84 Sharknado movies that seem to have appeared in recent years - this one was pretty good. It's short, so even the somewhat draggy middle goes by fairly quickly, it's graphic in places and every now and then frightening. The CGI shark was pretty good - although pretty much all of these shark movies leave me wondering about the sharks. From everything I've read, sharks basically don't like the taste of we humans. Apparently we don't have enough fat on us for their taste buds - and Blake Lively certainly doesn't. So this shark's obsession with her is kind of a mystery. I can understand its initial curiosity, but once it got a bite it really should have lost interest. But then we wouldn't have had a movie, I suppose. And this does turn out to be a pretty decent movie. (7/10)",The Shallows
37,Hellmant,A hell of a lot of fun!,8,13 July 2016,"'THE SHALLOWS': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new 'killer shark' horror flick, starring Blake Lively (Mrs. Ryan Reynolds!). The film tells the story of a surfer, that's stalked by a great white shark; just 200 yards from shore. It was written by Anthony Jaswinski, and directed by Jaume Collet-Serra; who's also helmed such other horror flicks as 2005's 'HOUSE OF WAX' remake, and 2009's 'ORPHAN' (as well as three Liam Neeson action movies). The film has done surprisingly well at the Box Office, and it's also gotten mostly positive reviews from critics (and audiences) as well. I loved it.Lively plays Nancy; a medical student, that decides to go surfing at the same remote Mexican beach that her mother did, many years earlier, when she was pregnant with Nancy. Her mother recently passed away, and Nancy is thinking about dropping out of school (because of it). While surfing, Nancy is attacked by a great white shark (just 200 yards from shore). She then becomes stranded on a reef, with a wounded leg, where the shark continues to relentlessly stalk her. The movie is one of those classic survival horror flicks. It's cheesy (at times) and a little unbelievable, but it's still suspenseful; and a hell of a lot of fun! Lively delivers a great performance in it, and I enjoyed Collet-Serra's stylistic direction (the movie always looks beautiful). Even though it seems like it could be a rather slow- paced film, it never is (it pretty much flies by). I'd definitely recommend it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/lcZBQp0HBZg",The Shallows
38,thesar-2,Open Water: The Revenge,2,4 October 2016,"Wait. Are we supposed to laugh out loud and say ""Oh, come on!!"" during a climax of a straight up, serious survival story? My guess: no. You should also say 'no' to this too-much CGI, all-but rated PG ""thriller"" just because of the conclusion (and one, off-screen shark- attack that nearly put me to laughter-tears.) No spoilers, but damn, that ending just ruined everything. Up to that point, I was almost onboard. It was definitely a Hollywood treatment of a realistic and scary scenario, but then it had to climax us into Jaws: The Revenge territory. How this shark didn't roar was the second biggest surprise.The biggest? How fast and hard they dropped the ball made of stone into the ocean.Blake (Not-So) Lively stars as rebel medical student, Nancy, who wants to run away to the place where her mother learned of her pending birth. Weird setup, but fine. The location is a Mexico cove a/k/a ""The Beach Which Shall Not Be Named"" and after meeting two fellow surfers, Nancy decides to take one last dip as her two male friends head on home for the evening. Big mistake. Huge!A whale of a tale happens: she gets stranded on some rocks with Wilson: The Bird because a shark wants more than the huge whale nearby for dinner. But, first, she's bitten pretty hard and her expert, midterm medical knowledge and speech helps her wounds. She's about 200 yards from shore – much like the real Gilligan's Island and she's wounded and the tide's coming in and she's bleeding and the shark's circling and I might have left the oven on and there are rays of hope and she must not like seafood.How will she survive? How would anyone survive? How on Earth did the writer solve her dilemma? Well, what he (writer Antony Jaswinski) has in store for you should make you both burst out in unintentional laughter and mouth agape with WTF?! yelping out over and over. For this very reason – the final act – you shouldn't even bother.And that's too bad. Some of the film, mostly the first act is well shot. Not perfect, not original – it's just a freaking beach we've seen in countless films and YouTube vids, but it's passable. And Lively isn't the worstshe just as passable as the filming. While the film felt generic and something you can watch on a Saturday night in to pass the time, it was still recommended. Untilwell, I've said it a few times.Today, I advised my friend I was going to watch this tonight. We got on the subject of the Open Water movies I actually really liked. If they stretched that series to a third movie just to be a cash-cow, this would certainly be that. Just don't bother. Skip it. UNLESS, you're like me and love those unintentionally hilarious ""serious"" movies. If that's the case, just know the premise (girl stranded on rocks, hunted by a shark while the tide comes in) and skip to the ending. Not only will that not change anything, but you're sure to get some good, hearty laughs in the finale.***Final thoughts: Day 4 Movie in the Can! I'm watching a NEW-2-ME horror movie every day of October 2016 and this one I really wanted to see awhile back. I really like realistic horror, unlike all the ghost stories of late. Sadly, as described above, I'll take a good old- fashioned haunted house story that was told countless times before than ever seeing this again.",The Shallows

40,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A competent film with a good lead performance and some engaging scenes but too much CGI and a weak final act.,6,10 August 2016,"'The Shallows (2016)' is the latest film directed by Jaume Collet-Serra - who brought you several fun Liam Neeson action flicks, including 'Non-Stop (2014)' and 'Unknown (2011)'. It focuses upon a young woman, portrayed by Blake Lively, who becomes stranded just a few hundred feet from shore when a shark begins to stalk her. The picture is a short 86 minutes, meaning that its limited premise isn't stretched out at all; the brisk pace allows for the story to be pushed as far as it can without breaking, leading to a lean flick that manages to constantly sustain the thin narrative. Overall, I like it but it has several flaws, most of which are narrative based.I'll start with the positives. The shark itself is fairly well realised, especially during the first two thirds of the film. It isn't actually on screen in full for a while, and the majority of the time it lurks beneath the surface. This is a technique borrowed from 'Jaws (1975)', except this time it isn't due to technical constraints. It works really well and the flick is at its best when the shark is a threat but not directly present. The fin carving through the water and the looming shadow from beneath the waves both inspire a certain amount of dread, and the beast feels the most realistic during these moments. The other positive is that the direction is not only competent but also mostly satisfying. Aside from a few odd jump-cuts and an occasionally 'music-video' vibe, the direction shows the action cleanly and effectively sets up each individual confrontation. The use of wide- angles and sometimes sweeping camera moves emphasise the isolation felt by the character, making the situation both understandable and tangible. There's some great injury make-up that looks realistic enough to inspire a wince, especially during some gruelling scenes where you can really feel the pain. The script is decent but not outstanding, working best when there isn't any dialogue; it's never dull, either. There are also a couple of jump-scares that are effective and the film maintains a taut pace, too.Now for the negatives. The main flaw I have is that the main character isn't really that engaging or interesting. Her backstory is actually rather weak, coming across as generic and obligatory. It is also told through a series of text messages, photos and video-calls which pop up on the screen in strange ways. This is trying to create a specific style, but it's dropped entirely once the shark comes into play. This means that it feels out of place and ineffective, and you have to wonder why it's done in the way it is. I don't really care all that much about the lead character, even though Blake Lively does a good job portraying her. The performance works best when there is no dialogue, as Lively manages to convey pain and emotion through nothing but body language. I feel her anguish in some scenes and want her to survive throughout, but her characterisation is pretty fragile. As I mentioned earlier, the direction is mostly good. However, there are a few early scenes focusing on surfing that feel more like an 'MTV' music-video than a feature film; there's strange, misplaced techno music and excessive speed ramping. The director also includes some out-of-place false jump-scares which inspire groans rather than shrieks, some odd 'found footage' sequences that break the flow of the narrative and an unnecessary tacked-on epilogue that feels redundant. The shark as a whole doesn't feel like a huge threat, either, even though its dangerous nature is made clear early on. It doesn't seem fully palpable, especially since it's all CGI. It looks good when only partially visible, specifically when it is nothing more than a silhouette against the cool blue sea (a nice juxtaposition of calm and aggression), but is on-screen in its entirety a little too often towards the end. This means that, for me, the danger doesn't feel as real. The final act is contrived and unbelievable, inspiring sighs rather than cheers, and it also feels a little coincidental. On top of that, the film has trouble maintaining a consistent tone and I honestly don't find it scary or, even, all that tense.Ultimately, 'The Shallows (2016)' is an enjoyable but flawed thriller that will keep you engaged throughout its short runtime. The physical acting is good, the predicament is prominent and the pain is tangible. However, the shark isn't that realistic when on screen, there isn't all that much tension and the final act is extremely contrived. Still, I like the overall experience despite its flaws: 6/10.",The Shallows
41,richardchatten,The Cruel Sea,7,11 April 2021,"If you ever find yourself thinking longingly of Australia's sunshine and beaches this film will go some way towards changing your mind; although shark attacks on humans are actually much, much rarer than this piece of high concept cinema in which strapping blonde Texan Blake Lively learns the hard way that time and tide wait for no man (or woman); and what is at first a nightmare comes increasingly to resemble a bad trip as she finds herself surrounded by fluorescent jellyfish and having hallucinations of her Mom.The film is interesting rather than as genuinely scary as 'Jaws' or 'Deep Water' (or the absolutely terrifying sequence in 'Sometimes a Great Notion' which the few people who have ever seen it will now be recalling with a shudder). And it has the usual 21st Century vicissitudes of an obviously CGI shark and wobbly steadicam photography.Hitchcock used to say he wanted to depict blood dripping on to a daisy, and here we get Blake Lively's blood on the feathers of a seagull, in addition to the ambush under an open sky in 'North by Northwest' and the use of the light changing to denote the passage of time in 'Rope'.Part of the punishment of being interned on Alcatraz was seeing the lights and hearing the sounds of San Francisco just as Ms Lively's ordeal is heightened by the proximity of the beach a short strip of water away as she's laid siege to by a shark clinging to rocks or a buoy the way the characters cowered in a cellar from zombies in 'Night of the Living Dead'.",The Shallows
42,bowmanblue,"Yeah, not that deep (but not that bad, either)",6,2 August 2018,"Woman versus flippin' massive shark? Who's going to win? Well, 'The Shallows' goes some way to answer that question (and Blake Lively as the women in question is really going to need a 'bigger boat'). She plays a young woman who goes on a personal pilgrimage to an isolated beach where her (now deceased) mother went to just before she fell pregnant. Blake indulges in a spot of surfing before finding herself trapped on a rock a few hundred yards away from the shore with a 'fin' swimming round and round her position.And that's basically that. What follows is an entire hour and a half of her trying to find a way off a rock. Yeah, it's a pretty simple premise and, although it does drag in some places, it's actually a perfectly watchable way of killing time. Being the only human on screen for much of the run-time Blake has to carry the film and she does that well enough. There are a few other characters who pop up here and there, but I don't think you'll be too surprised to find what happens to them!The location is great and the film could almost be used as a tourist video for the area (assuming you weren't bothered about being eating by a huge, angry fish), plus there's plenty of epic surfing shots. I'm sure I could find out on the internet whether Blake actually did all of them herself, or whether there was CGI trickery involved somewhere. Either way, they're really cool and totally convincing. And, while we're on the subject of special effects, I should mention the shark. We don't see much of it (besides the obligatory fin) for much of the movie, leaving its 'reveal' to the final act. And, I was a little disappointed. We're many decades away from 'Jaws' and yet creating a convincing shark hasn't really moved on that much.I can see a lot of the other reviews have marked 'The Shallows' a lot higher than I have. I can see how it might be enjoyed more than I did. I didn't hate it. I just felt that a story about a woman on a rock could have been trimmed down to a more 'TV episode' length rather than an entire movie. But, I don't regret watching it, however I doubt I'll bother watching it again, simply because it's simple story means you can quite clearly remember all you need to for quite some time without feeling the need for a re-watch.",The Shallows
43,ThomasDrufke,Gorgeously Messy,6,24 June 2016,"If I had to pick a favorite genre, thriller would be right up there with the rest of them. And although I'm not a horror guy, when the genre spins more into the thriller realm it usually means good news for me. The Shallows is the big horror-thriller of 2016 and even though it has a weak third act, I ended up enjoying the film a lot more than I expected to.Surprisingly, what I loved most about this movie had nothing to do with the shark, but everything to do with Blake Lively. Although the dialogue given to her via Anthony Jaswinski's script is pretty weak, Lively's physical performance does way more than any of the words coming out of her mouth do. This isn't meant as a detriment to the film, but it's probably more of a film you'd like watching more without volume.Which brings me to the next great thing about The Shallows, the cinematography. The beautiful Australian beach-side they filmed at gave Flavio Martínez Labiano a lot to work with, but I also gushed over the way he shot the night scenes along the beach. His visual flare also bled into the many shark attack scenes including one very impressive longer take that brought me right into the ocean alongside Blake Lively.Where The Shallows fails is in the final act. Even with the so-so script and the knowledge that sharks just don't attack people, I completely bought into the story. But as much as I like the action in the last segment, the logic is kind of thrown out the window. There are also a few attempts to pull at your heartstrings that fall flat. It's hard for a film that is only 80 minutes long to encapsulate the right amount of character depth, but I would have liked that aspect of the film to be handled better.So overall, The Shallows is better than I thought, but it could have been pretty great. I can't say any shark film will ever be the next 'Jaws', but with better attention to detail and less focus on getting the right camera angles of Blake Lively's assets, it would have had a stronger impact on me.+Beautiful landscape to shoot+Lively's physical performance+Decent amount of thrills-Average script at best-Third act falls apart6.7/10",The Shallows
44,cricketbat,"Ridiculous, but still scary and enjoyable",8,27 December 2018,"I know that real sharks don't actually behave like the one in The Shallows, but the shark in this movie acts exactly like my mind imagines a shark would act - it's hungry, it's vindictive and it's persistent. And despite her obviously animated menace, Blake Lively's performance is surprisingly realistic. The ending is somewhat ridiculous, but overall this anxiety-inducing horror movie is fairly enjoyable.",The Shallows
45,CuriosityKilledShawn,Jawsbreaker,7,10 August 2019,"There are more bad shark movies than I can possibly count, and I can count all the way to about 7 or 8. Jaws is obviously the gold standard of shark movies, but even that series, after the first (very underrated sequel) became a laughing stock. Since then we've had the ""just about passable"" fare of Deep Blue Sea and 47 Meters Down to the simply awful Meg and Sharknado. The Shallows quietly usurps all of these and manages to cut out a respectable corner in a horribly crowded sub-genre.Blake Lively is an adventure-seeking surfer taking a break from her med school studies to discover the secret Mexican (actually Australian) beach her late mother surfed at when pregnant with her. She's given a lift to this secret beach by a guy I was dead certain was Justin Long but it turns out that it's just a Spanish actor who looks exactly like him. Once in the water she immediately feels uncomfortable and is attacked by a Great White Haddock. The shore is only 200 yards away, and the water is only a few feet deep, but it's an impossible distance with an angry Great White circling in ever-diminishing diameters. Stranded on a tiny rock island, there is nowt to do but wait, scream for help, or take a million-to-one chance.Jaume Collet-Serra, who has carved a name for himself by directing half of Liam Neeson's recent filmography, wisely understands that less is more and that underplaying the suspense makes for a far more effective film that anything that indulges in overblown nonsense. He fills The Shallows with his usual visual trickery but it never feels out of place or overly stylish. There are some truly gorgeous shots here and some moments of tangible atmosphere, which is more than I can say about the majority of latter day studio features. Though the ""deep fake"" of the stunt double catching a tube, which Blake Lively was clearly unable to do, is a jarringly obvious effects-failure.For sure the winner of shark movies this decade. The Shallows is suspenseful and exciting, and, for someone who enjoys prolonged spells in tropical waters, quite nerve-wracking. Though, with a title like this, you'd think it was about modern-day females. It's 86 minutes of thrills and it's better than most movies twice that length.",The Shallows

48,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,18 September 2016,"The ShallowsFor some unknown reason sharks always get the munchies after eating a surfer.However, it's hard to tell if the great white shark in this thriller has bloodshot eyes.Determined to surf the same isolated inlet that her recently deceased mother surfed when she was younger, Nancy (Blake Lively) drops out of medical school and heads to Mexico.But her memorial quickly turns into a struggle for survival as she finds herself stalked by the same shark that laid waste to the humpback whale she now sits atop.Injured, Nancy eventually makes it over to a cluster of rocks, and later a buoy where she makes her last stand. A novel cat-and-mouse concept that falls apart on execution, this idiotic one-woman show is not only implausible, but its special effects are as laughable as Lively's deadpan performance.

Basically this is a Blake Lively vs. Great white shark - and it works for what it is and nothing more. Acting by Blake Lively and Great white shark was very good, but Sully 'Steven' Seagall stole every scene he was into. Directing by Jaume Collet-Serra was solid as well - pacing of this movie which runs at around 1 h 20 min is very solid, there isn't a dragging minute. Everything is solidly made, tight and ready to be sold for what it is.

50,Reno-Rangan,"Very close to the shore, yet too far and dangerous to attempt.",6,14 October 2016,"I'm sure you have seen shark attack films like 'Jaws', 'Deep Blue Sea' et cetera, and yep this another one to add to that collection. But this was something very neatly done, I mean for the most of the parts. Looked so real, so I thought it might end up top among its similar theme. In the end, I was little disappointed, because of the shark. The portrayal of shark was very natural, until the last half an hour. Then it becomes the common film gimmick when the animal was obsessed to kill its target at any cost.I am a huge animal fan, but I have never seen a live shark in my life and that does not mean I don't know anything about them. Thanks to the nature television networks and what I saw in this film was very disappointing if you love wild animals. I am not supporting the shark here, I'm just talking about its behaviour. It was not right, other than that, I definitely enjoyed the film. In fact, except the final few minutes, since the shark got pumped up, I had no issue and the best shark attack film. But the final battle ruined overall favour I'm going to give to it, what I thought this film deserved.Great location, and Blake Lively was unbelievably awesome. In the initial part, she was very sexy, but once the narration shifted its focus on surfing and later shark attack, everything changed. The entire film was edgy, I think very nicely written screenplay. It was a limited cast film and nearly the whole film takes place very close to the shore. A good start, neatly maintained mid part, but a below par conclusion, that's what I think about the film. Slightly missed to be a great film in the line of '127 Hours'. In fact, this looks like a sea version of that film. But I still recommend it, because it's worth.6.5/10",The Shallows

52,sol-,Open Water,6,18 December 2016,"Mauled by a shark while surfing at an isolated beach, a medical student has to tend to her wounds while working out a safe way back to shore in this horror thriller in the vein of 'Open Water'. Made on a bigger budget, 'The Shallows' is more effects-driven than 'Open Water' with sadly more overt than implied terror, however, 'The Shallows' is also infinitely better acted and it is an incredibly good-looking film overall. The underwater shots are very effective and all the above-water shots capture the serene nature beauty of the location very well; it is almost an ironic setting for such a horrifying tale to unravel. The screenplay is, however, far from airtight. We gradually learn that she has come to the beach as it was one of her deceased mother's favourite surfing spots, however, the film misses the mark to turn her survivalist tale into a parable for coping with grief. It also feels like more could have been made from her decision to drop out of medical school and how that factors into her survival quest. Most perplexing of all though is the sheer unlikelihood of everything that transpires; it more often feels like she persists out of lucky coincidences (though jellyfishes!) than ingenuity or a will to survive. Whatever the case, Blake Lively is solid throughout in a challenging role that requires her to command every scene. A well-trained seagull also provides one of the most memorable avian performances of recent time. The location-scouting team deserves some kudos too, and who would have guessed that the entire movie was filmed in Australia?",The Shallows
53,Thanos_Alfie,Will of living...,4,18 June 2020,"""The Shallows"" is a Drama - Horror movie in which we watch a surfer who is attacked by a white shark trying her best to survive with everything she has.I believe that every shark movie is very difficult to overcome the barrier of the movie ""Jaws"" and what it started. Nevertheless ""The Shallows"" is an average Horror movie that presents very well what a person has to go through in order to survive not only physically but mentally as well. The interpretation of Blake Lively who played as Nancy was good but not the best in order to save this movie. Finally, I have to say that ""The Shallows"" is another average but entertaining horror movie to spend your time.",The Shallows
54,zkonedog,"No Surprises, But Decent Enough",6,27 February 2017,"There is nothing about ""The Shallows"" that makes it a poor film. It has wonderful visuals, a decent plot, and a lot of excitement all-around. However, it also just happens to be one of those films where there are no surprises, and it helps to have a certain life-experience background to really ""get into it"".For a basic plot summary, ""The Shallows"" sees Nancy (Blake Lively) visiting an exotic, super- secret beach that her now-deceased mother once frequented. Stood up by a hungover gal pal, Nancy decides to go it alone for a day of surfing and self-reflection. On the last tide of the day, however, Nancy is visited by a surprise visitor from the deep, trapping her out at sea.As I said, this film has enough things going for it that it never is really boring. Lively is perfect for this leading role, and the visuals are inventive/exciting. There is even a plot that makes sense and is semi-realistic (i.e. not so far-fetched to have you rolling your eyes).The problem with ""The Shallows"" (keeping it from being a really good movie) is two-fold:1. There are absolutely no surprises in the film. If you've seen the trailer, you know pretty much exactly what will happen. It falls into a pretty defined genre, and plays out just like one would expected it too.2. Because of point #1, you really need to take your own experiences into this film to ""get into it"" (as the film itself won't create them for you). More to the point, if you can really relate to surfing and other oceanic pursuits you'll be sucked in much more than others, as the film doesn't quite do a good enough job of putting in other character drama (a side plot of Nancy having dropped out of medical school falls almost completely flat).Someday, Blake Lively will be fortunate enough to star in a great film under great direction. Neither of those things happen here. Blake is stunningly beautiful with great acting skills/personality, but her performance isn't enough to make ""The Shallows"" a great movie. A similar thing happened in her previous role in ""The Age of Adaline"".So, if you are a surfer who can viscerally, emotionally connect to the events in ""The Shallows"", you will likely enjoy the whole experience more than I. If you are looking for some surprises and less predictable storytelling, however, this one will probably be ""just okay"" for you.",The Shallows
55,Floated2,Straight to the point shark thriller,7,25 June 2018,"The Shallows is a relatively simply shark stranded thriller with the trailers showing exactly the type of film it is. This is a film which showcases Blake Lively as a strong leading actress and the film made a profit within its box office. Most criticism comes from the fact that it may seem unrealistic at times but overall the film does a decent job at keeping those on the edge of the seat, while maintaining and engaging and entertaining plot. The cgi is well done and keeps it simply throughout the film. The Shallows has a relatively slow start but within minutes has a quick build up to the point where we see Blake stranded by the rock. What was difficult in reasoning is how long she was on the rock with no food but yet seemed to have enough energy in swimming back and forth. Also as of note she meets a small seagull which steals the show in the end.Overall, the Shallows is a small simple film with a simple intention at entertaining and in does the job.

56,eddie_baggins,See it for the seagull,2,11 September 2016,"Ever since Jaws swam onto our screens all the way back in 1977, the simple shark movie has been a guilty pleasure for movie goers everywhere.In that time between bites we've laid witness to such treats as Deep Blue Sea, Open Water, the under-seen Aussie thriller The Reef and various other cinematic masterpieces like Jaws: The Revenge, The Last Shark and the daddy of them all, Sharknado. While clearly most films featuring a shark or sharks hunting down their prey are highly silly and nothing but an excuse to enact some grizzly shark led deaths, the shark sub-genre is a deserving favourite of many of us.That is until you watch The Shallows.A film that should rather be titled Blake Lively on a Rock or My Seagull Steven, Non-Stop director Jaume Collet-Serra's (going backwards after his fun Run All Night) newest horror/thriller is a bizarrely well reviewed steaming pile of whale carcass that for perhaps the very first time in film history features an actor out-acted by a wounded seagull.Filmed on the Australian Gold Coast and with a premise that seems ripe for guilty pleasure good times, Collet-Serra's film which seems more focused on leering shots of Lively (perhaps in realisation that her performance here is one humongous step back from the potential she showcased in The Town and to a lesser extent The Age of Adaline) and a shark that seems to have been trained by Dr. Evil himself, and but a step away from attaching a laser beam to his head in hopes on munching on Lively's incredibly smooth looking legs instead of just feasting on an entire whale carcass at his easy disposal, is anything but a good time.There's barely a thrill in sight to be found here as Lively's determined Texas surfer Nancy battles for survival on a convenient rock formation after being attacked by Jaws' long distant and far less memorable CGI cousin, and as half chewed bodies disappear from shorelines and flare guns are shot into the water, The Shallows makes for one highly annoying and utterly stupid excuse for a film.While the film looks good (in more ways than one) and there are limited moments of genuine intrigue, The Shallows will just make you want to watch Deep Blue Sea and will go down as one of the year's most unjustly liked experiences, even if it did introduce the world to Steven Seagull.1 half zipped-up rash vest out of 5",The Shallows
57,leonblackwood,Enjoyable disaster movie! 5/10,5,15 January 2017,"Review: Although this movie isn't in the same league as Jaws, it's still full of intensity and it does make you think, ""What would I do in the situation"". It's based around Nancy (Blake Lively), who goes to Mexico, after losing her mum, to surf in a secluded beach after her friend ditches her at the last minute. After bumping into 2 other surfers, who are filming there experience, she prepares to take her last waves for the day, while the other surfers leave the beach. She then sees a dead whale, which has obviously been there for some time, and while she investigates the carcass, she is bitten on the leg by a white shark, so she climbs on the whale for safety. With the shark circling her location, and her leg causing her a lot of pain, Nancy stays on the whale for a while and then she is forced to swim to a rock, because the whale starts to float away. Whilst on the Rock, her only company is a small seagull, who has damaged it's wing so it can't fly away. After spending the night on the rock, and using her imagination to attend to her wounds, the surfers return to do some more filming, and when they see Nancy on the Rock, they attempt to save her life, which ends up to be a complete disaster. With high tide coming up, Nancy has to think of a way to survive, so she records a message to her family, using the surfers video camera and throwing it towards the shore. She then works out a way to swim to a nearby buoy, which is much higher than the rock she is currently on. Once on the buoy, she finds a flare gun, which doesn't really help her situation, and she soon comes face to face with the white shark, which has made her Mexican experience a complete nightmare. Although this movie is mostly based on one character, there is enough material to keep the movie interesting throughout, and Blake Lively put in a convincing performance, even though the cameraman seemed to like close-ups of her body a bit too much. The shark looked pretty scary, especially when it was attacking the buoy but it's not the type of film that you can watch time and time again. Once you know the outcome of the film, it takes away the intensity of the plot but it's still a decent watch the first time round. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Blake Lively isn't actually a household name yet but she did play the lead in the Age of Adaline and the love interest in Savages. She also starred in Hick, Green Lantern, the Town, the Private Live of Pippa Lee and New York, I Love You, and after the popularity of this movie, the only way is up for the 29 year old star. This film was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, 42, who also brought you House of Wax, Goal II, Orphan, Unknown, Non- Stop and Run All Night. After working with Liam Neeson in his last 3 projects, he is due to release another movie starring Neeson, called the Commuter, which will also stars Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga and Sam Neill, so he's obviously built a trusting relationship with the star, who has said goodbye to the Taken franchise. As for this movie, I have to commend the director for his camera work in the sea, because it's definitely not the easiest task for any director, and I was quite impressed with the cinematography. I personally think that this is a well put together movie which was a surprising hit at the box office, and it proves that we are still entertained by disaster movies, involving unpredictable forces of nature.Budget: $17million Worldwide Gross: $119millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their horror/thriller/dramas, starring Blake Lively, Oscar Jaenada, Brett Cullen, Angelo Josue Lozano Corzo and Sedona Legge. 5/10",The Shallows
58,TheMovieDiorama,"A great comeback for shark films, but with limited depth.",7,25 September 2016,"The comeback for shark films and Blake Lively, The Shallows follows Nancy who travels to an unknown beach to surf...however she is shortly confronted by cinema's most dangerous sea creature, a Great White Shark. Throughout the years we've had masterpieces such as Jaws, and then we've had some so-so films like Deep Blue Sea...and then we come to the utter tripe like Sharknado. The Shallows was a chance to get moviegoers back into their seats and scared deathless by the sea creature, and for the most part it succeeds. Blake Lively has the job of essentially being the only written character in the film and she carries it extremely well. Her performance was very subtle and understated and I thought she did very well. Visually this film was outstanding, it actually took me by surprise. The colour palette used to enhance the tropical environment was aesthetically sublime (definitely a blu-ray purchase for me!). With the assistance of the excellent direction and camera work from director Jaume Collet-Serra (famous for Liam Neeson films: Unknown, Non-Stop and Run All Night) this was definitely a treat for the eyes. The transition from the wobbly camera underwater shark's point of view and the tracking landscape shots of the beach was refreshing. There are a few gory scenes that some might find excessive but the gore adds to the fear of the shark and it did the trick. The sound editing was also adequate, whenever Nancy got into the waters the sound turned up a notch and the tension kicked in. Whilst the film was a good comeback, I did find that there were a few flaws. The shark itself was rather bad CGI and it did take me out of the film on multiple occasions. The first 20 minutes seemed like a sport advertisement for surfing and I personally thought it went on for too long, and with an 86 minute runtime it cannot afford to waste any time. A major problem with many one character films is that they are severely under written, and this is no different. Her backstory was forced and because of this it was difficult to become attached and invested in her. Overall, The Shallows was a successful comeback for the shark genre with great direction and an excellent performance from Blake Lively, even with an under developed script.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",The Shallows
59,Tweetienator,Sharks Are Back,7,22 October 2018,"The Shallows is one little surprisingly good horror flick with a great performance by Blake Lively and - a shark. Lots of suspense and thrill, everything on the point without fillers. Great cinematography too. And this movie just proofs - you don't need a super budget and great setting and stuff to make a great piece of horror. This Shallows just needs a beach, a good actress, a good camera and some FX.If you like movies like Spielberg's Jaws, Open Water (2003), The Reef (2010), Bait (2012), this one will be right up your alley.",The Shallows
60,paul-allaer,"""Jaws"" for the 21st century... both terrific and terrifying",8,27 June 2016,"""The Shallows"" (2016 release; 87 min.) brings the story of Nancy (played by Blake Lively). As the movie opens (following a pre-credit scare), Nancy is in a pick-up truck being driven by a local towards a 'secret' beach in Mexico (the local refuses to give the beach's name), where Nancy's mom went all those years ago when pregnant with Nancy. Once at the beach, Nancy is ready to go surfing, the only other people being there are 2 local guys also surfing. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Jaume Collet-Serra, best known for the recent Liam Neeson action movies Non-Stop and Run All Might. Here he takes a tougher challenge, namely how to bring a great white shark attack survivor-thriller in a way that makes it original, believable and entertaining. It is hard to believe that the original movie in this genre. ""Jaws"" is now over 40 years old. Let's get the obvious question addressed right away: is this movie terrifying? The unequivocal answer is a resounding YES. There were quite a few scenes that I could barely look at the screen, hiding my eyes. One of the biggest lessons we learned from ""Jaws"" is ""less is more"", and Collet-Serra basically follows that formula, as we don't really get all that many open looks at the shark up close until very late in the movie. Also helpful is the outstanding photography, which is pure eye-candy from start to finish (the movie was filmed entirely in Australia). Last but certainly not least is the strong performance by Blake Lively, who is by herself for much of the movie. This role might very well catapult her to the top tier of actresses, at least financially. Bottom line: I head seen the trailer of ""The Shallows"", and the actual movie lived up to my high expectations, and even surpassed them. The perfect summer movie: both terrific and terrifying at the same time.""The Shallows"" opened wide this past weekend. The Sunday matinée screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely. Box Office Mojo has reported that the movie grossed much better this past weekend than had been projected, but that doesn't surprise me. This movie is bound to get fabulous word-of-mouth and this will play very nicely in theaters in the weeks to come. If you loved ""Jaws"". you will liked this one too. ""The Shallows"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",The Shallows
61,subxerogravity,It was suspenseful and exciting,8,27 June 2016,"Blake Lively gets her butt kicked on a surfing trip when she encounters a shark with the nastiest attitude.So I hope you like Black Lively, because you'll be spending ninety minutes or so with her as she attempts to survive in the water with a shark circling her, waiting to kill. If you don't like Lively, I think this movie will change your mind. She's really good in it, and really good at sucking you into the turmoil she's going through.The shark itself was a great visual effect. It movies (for the most part) like a real animal and it's nothing but scary when it attacks.The Shallows keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next and how is Lively going to escape from being Shark meat. Towards the end, it felt like the filmmakers ran out of ideas to do that, but overall it's worth sitting thought most definitely.",The Shallows
62,jtindahouse,Can't live up to its promise of an incredible ending,6,24 August 2016,"I always remember the tagline for 'Saw V' being ""You won't believe how it ends"", despite it having the most tame and believable ending of possibly the entire series. A bizarre piece of marketing. 'The Shallows' promised a similar thing with the tag ""If you think you know how it ends, you have no idea"", or something along those lines. When you make a promise like that you really have an obligation to deliver on it. It didn't. I assume they were referring to the way in which the main character 'Nancy' eventually killed the shark. It was clever enough (despite being highly illogical and effectively impossible) and worked for entertainment purposes, but it certainly didn't leave me stunned, wondering how on earth they come up with this stuff.The movies run time was a short 96 minutes, and it really wouldn't have wanted to push more than that as things were getting a little tedious and monotonous by the end. It's a fun ride though. There are some decent shark scares and Blake Lively is a strong enough actress to pull off the emotional scenes and keep us caring about her survival. There was a real feel of 'Castaway' about it, with the sidekick 'Steven Seagull' even rivaling that of 'Wilson' (though I suspect not as iconic). It's a way to kill 90 minutes, but not a lot more than that. There are better films you'll see this year, and there are worse ones too.",The Shallows
63,billcr12,Jaws Lite,4,25 September 2016,"Nancy(Blake Lively) is a medical student whose mother has died, and finds the need to escape the rigors of education for the shores of a Mexican beach to find a meaning of life. It begins with Nancy riding in a beat up old pickup truck bantering between her bad Spanish and the strangers marginal English, exchanging ideas about the seashore. Nancy peels down to a bikini, puts on a wet suit, grabs a surf board, and heads out to sea. After riding the waves like Spiccoli from Fast Times at Ridgemont High(without Sean Penn's wit), Nancy discovers a dead whale floating nearby. It has, of course, drawn sharks, including a very big and mean one who turns his attention towards Nancy. She moves like an Olympic swimmer and finds refuge on a rock, with a friendly white bird to keep her company. It is all down hill, or upstream from here, with Nancy doing battle with the Great White, by any means necessary. Eighty four minutes of absolute stupidity; a bad script and high school drama club acting by Miss Lively, or, Mrs. Ryan Reynolds; he should have been in the water with her in his Deadpool costume; it might have been more believable. Avoid this like shark infested water.",The Shallows

Blake Lively does give as pretty good descent performance, although in some scenes I felt they where trying to display some of her sexiness. It is pretty suspenseful moments with the shark, I also felt they was one scene that was paying homage to Jaws. It's not a classic, but a fun scary film that will keep you interested.",The Shallows

The great white shark is the most feared creature on Earth. (Well, perhaps apart from human beings). Why, then, is there only one movie about them that is scary? Why are filmmakers incapable of using them effectively?This movie has tension at the beginning, but wastes it in the second and third act.

This makes a great change from the glut of ridiculous shark movies ""inspired"" by the likes of 'Sharknado"". No roaring shark (I didn't hear any anyway) and no CGI that looks like they were done by a 5 year old. Sure, there are goofs and gaffs, and I felt that the final showdown was pretty silly.

67,PWNYCNY,Intense drama.,8,22 July 2016,"This is an intense movie, one that is well worth the time to watch. There are two main characters, the surfer and the shark. They are in a struggle for survival. One of the reasons why the story works so well is because of the way the shark is depicted. Here the shark is shown to be a territorial creature whose area has been encroached by humans. That intensifies the conflict between the surfers and the shark. Blake Lively gives a strong performance as the surfer who unwittingly invades the shark's domain. She is in virtually every scene and carries the movie. The only problem with the movie is the way it ends. At that point the movie opts for a more conventional ending of the story, which, given the nature of the interaction between the two protagonists, is contrived. The ending will not be revealed here. However, it does bring the story to a close, albeit in a way that does not keep open the option of a sequel, at least one involving that particular shark.",The Shallows
68,stevendbeard,A Great Summer Popcorn Movie,7,25 June 2016,"I saw ""The Shallows"", starring Blake Lively-Gossip Girl_tv, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants movies; Oscar Jaenada-Cantinflas, The Cold Light of Day and Brett Cullen-The Dark Knight Rises, Lost_tv.This is a shark vs girl movie. And lets be honest. Sometimes, it's not all that realistic. But, it is a great summer popcorn movie! Blake plays a Baylor medical school dropout from Galveston, Texas that is trying to deal with her mother's death. She decides to go surfing on a beach in Mexico that had special meaning to her mother. One of the reasons she dropped out of school was her mother's death and Brett, her father, tries to convince her to go back to school. Blake loves to surf- she lives in Galveston, remember?-and after catching a ride with Oscar to the beach, she is soon out in the beautiful waves and discovering that she is not alone. A great white shark is in the shallow waters of the little cove she is in and after narrowly escaping the initial attack, she makes it to a little group of rocks and corral that is sticking up out of the water, about 200 yards from shore. Only problem? The rise and fall of the tides! So she has to devise a plan pretty darn quick and that is where the suspense comes in, in spades. And it was also pretty fortuitous that her mother taught her to never give up because in a fight against a great white, what chance does a person have, either strength wise or in out swimming one? The only advantage would be in being resourceful and maybe out smarting them-using the old brain and never giving up. It's rated ""PG-13"" for bloody images, intense sequences of peril and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 27 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",The Shallows

It makes the most of a very limited cast and setting. It's a bit of a combination of Cujo and Jaws. Blake Lively goes for a surfing trip and gets trapped by a circling great white shark. First on a whale carcass, then on a rock, and then on a buoy. She also has to deal with a gash on her leg, high tide, and jellyfish. The movie manages to keep your suspense up as the shark circles. I like the final showdown, and her bird companion is very cute. *** out of ****",The Shallows
70,jimbo-53-186511,"At times the film asks for too much to be taken at face value, but it's still a pretty tense and entertaining ride",6,6 June 2018,"Keen surfer and aspiring doctor Nancy Adams (Blake Lively) heads to a secluded beach in Mexico for a spot of surfing. However, she ends up in difficulties when she is attacked by a shark. Nancy soon finds herself pitting her wits against the fearsome creature in order to get the better of it before the tide comes in...When watching any film involving a battle of wits with a shark then it's inevitable that comparisons are going to be made to Jaws which is clearly the yardstick that all of these films are going to be measured against. In this respect, The Shallows doesn't actually do a bad job and is better than I expected it to be, but it is still lacking in one or two areas...For a start I did find that the film asked me to ignore or accept too many things at face value that are either illogical or just simply contrived; a half eaten man is lay somewhere on the beach, but 2 surfers return back the next day and fail to notice said corpse on the beach before entering the water - you could argue that the half eaten man could have got swept back out to sea before the break of dawn, but at this point I believe that it was long before the tide was coming in so if this did happen it would totally go against the narrative. They also fail to notice Nancy stranded on the rock until they're halfway into the sea and don't seem to be able to hear her warnings about the shark (even though earlier a practically comatosed drunkard could hear what she was saying from twice the distance.)The film also asks you to accept some rather ridiculous contrivances; an army of jellyfish happen to congregate in the very path of the place that Nancy needs to get to (for seemingly no real reason) and she ascertains that she'll be safe passing through the jellyfish as the shark won't chase her as it won't want to get stung?? Seriously? Are we expected to buy this? Quite how she would know this is in anyone's guess? Is she a marine biologist or does she drink with David Attenborough? She also apparently manages to navigate through several jellyfish whilst badly injured and only gets stung once (and yet she just yells 'Ow' and carries on). Really? I would have thought that any human that was stung by a jellyfish that size would be in pain for hours, but seemingly not here.OK.OK. Enough is enough. I think I've made my point that this film has more holes in it than Swiss cheese, but in fairness it does work fairly well as a survival film; Nancy's medical skills do serve some purpose in the film and are what keeps her going and keeps her alive (this side of the story is probably the only believable aspect). She spends a great chunk of her time with a wounded bird which was actually quite a sweet angle to the story. Despite occasional moments of stupidity and some ridiculous contrivances I have to admit that this film did entertain me and had just about enough tension to make it worthwhile (sure it isn't Jaws, but despite the multitude of flaws it isn't actually a bad film when all is said and done.)",The Shallows
71,Foreverisacastironmess123,"Very enjoyable horror thriller with a shark, not quite great but definitely a worthwhile watch!",7,23 June 2018,"This joined the extremely limited number of what I'd consider to be good shark movies that I've ever seen, I thought it had a great solid setup and a pretty immersive atmosphere that let you imagine a little of how scary such a situation would be. I found it overall to be a good movie because to me, for the most part it used the shark in an effective way that played up to its natural strengths as a terrifying predator of the sea, you constantly feel the threat of it lurking somewhere beneath the waves, and while we all know what a Great White looks like, when they really started showing it in all its vicious toothy glory it looked awesome, and was to me some fantastic cgi. I thought the beautiful Blake Lively gave a strong performance that very well conveyed her fear and as well as her will to survive against a very determined beast as the few options available to her gradually disappeared along with her ever-shrinking point of safety. I can see why they gave her the precious seagull to play off though, I don't think any actor could spend practically a whole movie's length standing on a rock completely alone and make it work.(James Franco? Hm..) Even Tom Hanks had Wilson! I think that in the closing scene when she's surfing again it should have revealed that she'd lost her leg instead of just having a little scar, it would have been more fitting and given a little more weight to her ordeal. There are certainly times when the shark action does start to feel noticeably Farfetched, like the jellyfish thing and when she sets it on fire with the whale oil, and especially how she gets it to impale itself on the buoy rebars...but I don't know it was a somewhat glossy thriller, it felt like it earned those moments and I think the final confrontation did call for something with a touch more oomph anyway.. Probably the biggest hole in the movie is why exactly a fairly mindless shark would bother tirelessly stalking one stranded human that it couldn't even really get to when it had a whole dead whale right there, or after it devoured those two and a half people! Sharks aren't really capable of becoming enraged or even territorial, last I checked, but it did work well for the plot, and I had fun with the flick, we already got a one hundred percent realistic shark movie that was called Open Water and it was a boring pile of crap. The most appealing thing about the move for me would have to be the visuals, all the beautiful bright open shots of the beach and the crashing blue sparkling waters were uplifting to look at and it had to be one of the most prettiest movies I've ever seen. It was cool too to have a semi-horror movie that was set in broad vivid daylight instead of the usual drabness. So while some might find it slow I was consistently engaged by this movie and I found it to be a tense and entertaining flick that I thought made great use of the shark as a classic menace and that to me made up for its flaws, and I'm glad that there are still the odd bright spots to be found in an often brutally abused horror sub-genre yet!",The Shallows
72,cjonesas,"[8.9] Rocky shallows at the sea, so wet and shining beautifully!",9,28 June 2021,"The shallows is a superbly well-done and thrilling movie with great acting by Blake Lively, intense nail-biting moments, fitting haunting score and more than good CGI and VFX.The horror and despair she's going through, the ultra precarious situation that she finds herself in, the moments that she passes on that small rock, bleeding and shivering frightfully like seeing the end of her life arriving, watching the sun setting, dusk arriving and with that the danger that she's in being magnified to horrendous extent are all gut-wrenching psychologically, making you shiver from the inside out, feeling as if your heart doesn't beat at all or it's going to jump out of your chest.The movie tells its story simply yet awesomely with smooth flow and intelligent development. Kudos to Blake Lively who plays very believably and embodies the character to marvelous extents.The ending is a little cheesy and unrealistic, but is forgiven from my side, as nothing's perfect. If we wanted to see a different, maybe more realistic ending, then all the love and sympathy that we feel for the character throughout her horrendous journey, may have gone with the wind and turned to dust.A thrilling movie that I liked very much, made me remember why you better swim and surf in your swimming-pool! And why Loco sharks are better left Alone in the ocean, their natural habitat, where they can happily prey upon and torpedo towards their preys from 15 meters beneath, well disguised by the luring black-blue shades of the deep sea.P.

73,kirbylee70-599-526179,It's Still Not Safe To Go Back In The Water,8,4 October 2016,"Believe it or not it's been 41 years since JAWS was released to theaters. That movie has become a classic, as thrilling a ride today as it was all those years ago. Since then a few movies about sharks have come and gone, most of them low budget films or the occasional sharks in a tornado. Now along comes a movie that tries to take the fear of sharks to a new intensity. Does THE SHALLOWS work?Blake Lively plays Nancy, a young woman trying to find herself after the recent death of her mother. She's left behind her father and younger sister as well as her medical schooling. Vacationing in Mexico and trying to locate a beach her mother told her of, a beautiful shore that offers tremendous surfing. Her friend having ditched her for partying in their hotel, Nancy is taken by a guide to the beach and left to discover its beauty.She suits up, grabs her surfboard and heads out into the water. Once on the waves she meets two guys also there for the surfing, one with a GoPro camera mounted on a helmet. They strike up a cordial camaraderie on the waves and enjoy the great surfing there. Nancy goes in for a while and then heads back out while the other two head to shore.Once back on the waves Nancy sees something in the distance. She paddles her board over to it to discover it's a whales that's been partially eaten by a predator with a large bite. Realizing she might be in danger she tries to head for shore only to be sideswiped and bitten by the huge shark responsible for the dead whale. Gathering her wits and climbing up on the whale, she watches as her broken board drifts away. She calls to the two fellow surfers about the leave the shallows to no avail. With a lacerated leg she waits until the timing is right and swims to a nearby rock formation only to cut her foot on the jagged coral at its base. The coral and the tide moving out were things she was warned of. Now, with leg and foot bleeding, she must use every resource she has to survive. Her first effort is to stop the bleeding from her leg, a rather gruesome sight for some.On the small outcropping barely 8 feet wide, she makes a friend of sorts in a seagull with a broken wing. As the pair struggle to survive, 200 yards from shore, Nancy will find out if she has the determination that made her mother a survivor in life and a woman who faced death with courage. Various events happen during her time on the outcropping including the attempted rescue by her two new friends, an attempted rescue by a drunk and her eventual decision to swim to a life buoy nearby in hopes of finding something she can use to survive.So let's talk about the shake first. Most of us recall the mechanical shark we grew up watching in the movie JAWS. It was terrifying at the time but subsequent viewings have made it seem not quite what it seemed that first time around. With the effects capabilities we now have today a CGI shark not only looks real but is far more capable of feats and actions that the mechanical one couldn't accomplish. Does it work? I would say yes. When viewed from above looking straight down it is an enormous beast of a great white shark. The attack moments will put you on seats edge. So yes, it works.Lively does a great job without someone to toss lines back and forth to. Her acting skills are used to display what this character does in order to survive as opposed to just looking pretty. The combination of pain from wounds and determination not to die alone on a small rock make her performance one that stands out and yet will no doubt never be nominated for anything. Perhaps it's not Oscar material but it's better than some I've seen win.What really makes this movie work is that it is an old movie. By that I mean that it is made like movies used to be made. The story slowly unfolds. The desperation seen by Nancy isn't something that lingers only on the immediate situation but plays out over the 80 some minutes of the film. It's never rushed, the movie never presses forward at breakneck speed in order to placate MTV generation film goers with fast and furious images. Instead it takes the time to tell a story. THE SHALLOWS is a movie I could see watching again. It entertained from start to finish. It kept you guessing what would happen next. In today's world there is no guarantee that the star will survive. Another shark film, OPEN WATER showed that. And perhaps this one does too. I won't spoil that for you. You'll have to watch to find out if all of Nancy's attempts to make it through this have a happy ending or not. Don't worry, it will be worth the watch.",The Shallows

She was so intense and very realistic here. The sequences that involve Lively and the shark are filled with pure intensity and are of a thrilling nature, as they should be. I also like how the beginning of the film is very calm and just normal, it's building up to the scariness and the suspense. Brett Cullen was good as the dad and the rest of the small cast is good I guess, I mean to be quite honest it's Blake lively that carries the film completely. But it's alright because she does it very very well. I most definitely recommend this suspenseful shark attack thriller! It's well acted, smartly written and filmed very well! I love that line too!

76,aharmas,Beautiful and Scary Suspense,9,26 June 2016,"I have liked Blake Lively. She can inhabit a character and give weight to the movies she has made, even when some of them are a bit hard to believe. She made the premise of being centered the reason to keep watching ""Gossip Girl"", and her elegance and poise were the reason ""The Age of Adelyne"" was something more than a trivial romance through the years, and she now takes on one of the biggest and scariest beasts in the ocean. She tops Dreyfuss and company in ""Jaws"" because she has to fight a Great White with pretty much whatever is available while she hangs from a rock and later on a buoy, pretty much fighting a losing battle until it becomes clear that she won't quit easily.It's hard to believe someone could fight and survive a situation like the one in ""The Shallows"". From its beginning, it becomes clear that the shark is quite a monster, and it is angry because apparently. Lively and company have invaded its eating grounds, and someone has done something previously which might be irritating this wondrous animal's temper more than it is necessary.Throughout the film, we are treated to Lively's independent and resourceful free spirit as she is currently dealing with a personal crisis. She has gone south to Mexico to visit a special place in her family's history, and at first, we are treated to some gorgeous vistas and camera work. There's some very good stunt work here, and at times, I was wondering how much of the work was done by the actress herself. She is in almost every scene, and she must spend all the time either floating or swimming underwater. There are some scenes that will make you cringe because of the way they are done. If you ever dealt with Jelly Fish and know the pain that can inflict, you will definitely be a bit on the jumpy side.Some of the work done with the ""shark"" itself is indeed very exciting. I love the way he attacks his prey, and though part of the suspense is how we never know when or where he might show up, we only need to know that it is angry and hungry. There were moments when I was uncertain about the resolution of the film because of the way the screenplay cleverly tells the story. Gasp! This one might have an epic battle between Lively and the shark, but the ending might surprise the audience.Be prepared for a good time in what it certainly is one of the best shark films since ""Jaws"".",The Shallows
77,peterp-450-298716,The seagull definitely deserves a nomination.,6,29 September 2016,"""I'm not totally alone. I've got this little dude, Steven Seagull, here keeping me company.""When you succeed in attracting more attention as a puny little seagull than a large over-sized shark, you deserve an honorable mention at any reputable film festival. Never before was I charmed by poultry. A confident, wounded animal and certainly pleasant company. Not even one silly word came out of his beak. A fellow victim in the same life-threatening situation. Steven Seagull was an ingenious contribution to the movie. That way Nancy (Blake Lively) wasn't compelled to talk to herself a large portion of the movie. Because, believe me, a cozy chat with the bloodthirsty shark that swam circles around her, wasn't part of her schedule.And so we arrive at the following participant out of the world of fauna. The six-meter long psychotic shark who wasn't satisfied with just the rotting carcass of a whale. Apparently this carnivore doesn't like to be disturbed while eating. The comparison with the famous shark ""Jaws"" is inevitable. Anatomically it's probably all very accurate. Only in ""The shallows"" this predator is completely computer generated, while the Jaws model was a mechanical and electronic model. Not that sharky in this film seemed fake or anatomical wrong. But in ""Jaws"" you got the impression that it was a lifelike trained shark. When I was a youngster, I won a plastic shark at the fair. He had gaping jaws and looked quite menacing to me. Until you shoved him to the ground and his gaping mouth was double folded. This plastic monster looked much less threatening when doing that. Rather laughable. Wait for the denouement in ""The Shallows"" and you'll understand what I mean.Between all this fauna there's a female human being in a tiny bikini. Nancy is a ravishing appearance who needs a moment of reflection in her life after the death of her mother. Nothing is more fun than to travel to a Mexican bay where her mother used to go once. Blake Lively was unknown to me, but after seeing her trained body and perfect-looking female parts, I'm planning to watch the other movies she participated in. I'll be honest. Lively lying on her surfboard with a camera strategically focusing on her tightly shaped buttocks, was a breathtaking sight. Kudos to Collet-Sera to make this film in such a way that my attention was diverted from these bodily temptations, even though she was wearing a bikini the whole movie. All praise for Lively as well, because she plays almost the entire movie cavalier seul. Not a simple task and she does it with gusto. And this thanks to the excellent cooperation of Steven Seagull.In terms of story, it actually wasn't that big of a deal. Exotic blonde visits a beautiful beach and surfs in azure blue water. According to a shark, she looks like a snack. And she ends up on a piece of rock situated too far from the beach and a buoy. Her task is to get to safety, while the highly intelligent shark is patrolling nearby. Not very original. What remains are the beautiful images. Both the slow motion footage of the waves, as the underwater clips, look sublime. Perfect images that would fit in a ""Bounty"" commercial. And then there's the steadily increasing tension. It's waiting for the shark to show up, the fatal attack and whether Blake Lively will manage to stay alive (again an appropriate name) and escape. All in all a lot of positive things in this film (except the totally whacked ending) with a simple story. Yet Steven Seagull remains the brilliant highlight of ""The Shallows"".More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",The Shallows
78,aidanratesmovies,Meh,4,14 March 2021,"It has its moments, and it's certainly watchable, however The Shallows is mostly a forgettable and bland little Shark thriller with nothing very newor out of the box to deliver along the way. Perhaps one of the films greatest flaws was the first 20 minutes. Obviously it was needed for the sole purpose of making the film a needed length for theaters, but it's just shlock full of filler, unnecessary backstory, and a weird amount of commercial like shots. There are legit moments that I wondered how much these companies paid to get their advertising in this film, and so many slow-mo shots towards the beginning it began to be nauseating. As for the standard shark action portion of the plot, it has its intense moments, but I felt the most intense moments oddly didn't really involve the shark at all. Moments where she is doing stitches, and jellyfish and, other side events feel a lot more frightening than the CGI shark- and I'm sure that's not the point it was trying to make- but the film certainly would feel better as a lost at sea movie rather than a shark movie. Lively is fine in her role, her dialogue is written horribly, but she gives her emotional scenes with such strength you will forgive her by the end. Sully Seagull is also an animal actor as the seagull in the film, and honestly, my favorite part, ause that bird is adorable. In conclusion, I will not remember The Shallows in the long run. In terms of shark films, it's not as bad as 47 Meters Down but nowhere near as good as Jaws . Is it bad per say, no, but it's not anything remarkable either.
My Rating: 5/10",The Shallows
79,valleyjohn,Blake Lively carries this film,6,19 September 2016,"Steven Spielberg has a lot to answer for. Ever since he made Jaws in 1975 there have been countless attempts on the big screen to emulate that film and all have failed. Some have been excruciatingly bad but thankfully The Shallows isn't one of those. This is the story of Nancy who travels to a secluded beach to surf . While in the water , she is hunted by a great white shark and finds herself stranded on a rock with the tide going out . Wounded and with time running out she battles to get away from the shark. Probably the best thing about this film is performance of Blake Lively. She definitely carries this film. The action is pretty good although totally predictable and it looks great up until the use of CGI underwater when it starts to look like a scene from a Sharks Tale. At a pleasant running time of 84 minutes , The Shallows is good bit of escapism but like every other shark film , it's no Jaws.",The Shallows
80,AudioFileZ,One Woman Show Vs. Super Jaws,6,9 September 2016,"Shark movies are impossible after JAWS as the sequels more than prove. The writers here took a different approach with one person being attacked and terrorized over a 48-hour period. The story goes something like a young woman's trek to her mother's secret surfing beach in Mexico. It's a sort of mental housecleaning trip to remember her late mother. It;s a quick setup sans much development with a little nice surfing footage. The beach is secluded and secretive as the gal's driver and only two other surfers on the beach won't reveal the name. Soon she's left alone for that one last ride. Of course she should have never went alone to a secluded beach in Mexico so one last rip and ride is heavy on the rip part. When the attack occurs it's no surprise that she's injured severely but if she can keep her wits she might survive. At this point, minus the spotty setup, it's really a good shark attack movie. She sorts out how to get to the one coral rock that is above the tide which is receding. Her actions and emotions here feel real even with the major drama of a killer shark. The movie slowly gets less and less believable which hampers the previously good part. As if to underscore Bruce (the JAWS shark) has met it's on-screen match there must be death. Three more unwitting victims soon follow, two of which are the previous day's surfers who return. Still, this just might be possible. I guess though Hollywood needs the titillation of violence and since there aren't explosions (well, maybe a whale oil fueled one for good measure) the shark has got to ramp it up offensively. This is where they go too far. The shark's attack on her last hope, a buoy, gets the full Tinseltown treatment. It's a bit much for a film that signaled realism earlier.There are certainly things that I liked about the movie however. It's pretty much a one woman show with Blake Lively turning in a good performance as the surfer gal. She seems like a real feisty determined surfer type. The use of one of the other surfer's GoPro cam was decently woven in if a bit too convenient. It's just when the shark goes over-the-top rogue when the movie breaks and, as slang goes: ""jumps the shark"". I guess for a stab at a shark attack flick it's decent enough to get a 6.",The Shallows

82,a_chinn,Fake looking CGI shark ruins potentially good shark thriller,5,20 August 2017,"Okay shark thriller would have been better without the fake looking CGI shark. Blake Lively plays a lone vacationer in Mexico on a surfing trip and finds herself stalked by a shark after surfing alone one day. After the first bite chomps her board, she has to scramble onto whatever she can to keep away from the shark, which ranges from a dead whale carcass, to buoys, to rock outcroppings. The film is beautifully photographed, with some especially nice surf footage, and Lively manages to carry the film in what is essentially a one-woman show. However, it's the Sharknado-like overuse of CGI that ruins what might have been a more suspenseful of film. SPOILER ALERT! Seeing a flaming shark fly through the air really takes you out of any sort of realism and places this squarely in SyFy Channel movie levels of ridiculousness. I may have been harder on this film after having recently re-watched Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws,"" which famously showed very little of the shark, and as fake as the Jaws shark was, it was absolutely terrifying. Not as bad as I'd expected and is a respectable enough of little survival film, but it's nothing brilliant.",The Shallows
83,Samiam3,The Shallows runs aground,5,19 January 2017,"Considering how entertaining Serra's last three movies were, The Shallows came off as disappointing. I had a hunch that it would be a little cheesy, but what unfolds on the screen could almost be mistaken for a comedy.A nicely shot (although noticeable colour-toned) film, The Shallows renders Blake Lively helpless on a reef, just a hundred feet from shore, after a bite to the leg from a territorial great white. It is a remote and obscure beach, where the only soul who wanders in after the first act is a potbellied drunk who is too full of tequila to hear our heroine scream for help. While stuck on the reef, she also has the company of an injured seagull, who I kept wishing was Wilson the Volleyball. Blake Lively is not a bad actress but she is not a good one either. She goes through all the motions of a damsel in distress who ends up having to save herself, but the role could have been played by a porn star. There are too many moments prompting unintentional laughter for The Shallows to work as a thriller. It gives us a great white shark that is credibly animated, yet unscary. Perhaps part of the problem is that the animal is just too real. In Jaws, we saw the great white not as a shark but as a monster. Jaws also worked because it made us not merely afraid of the shark, but of the water. In a movie like the Shallows however, the ocean is a beautiful place,and beneath the waves, you have a hundred foot visibility.Blake beats the shark through a brainy, dare devilish manoeuvre but by the time we get there, we are too far detached to care. This is not an unwatchable movie, but it is best enjoyed merely as Blake Lively beach porn. If you want to see a better movie of this type, try The Reef.",The Shallows
84,pachara87,The Shallows is a thrilling survival ride.,6,18 April 2019,The Shallows is a solid B-movie that doesn't pretend to be anything other than a B-movie. That goes a long way in a summer movie season in which several big budget blockbusters have overreached and failed.,The Shallows
85,TheOneThatYouWanted,"Yeah, it is alright.",7,4 July 2016,"Not sure why people are making a big deal about this movie. Shark movies are a dime a dozen. The plot of this movie is basically 127 Hours meets Jaws. The movie isn't bad but it just isn't worth watching on the big screen if you can help it. There are so many hot actresses in Hollywood but not enough of them can actually act. I feel Blake Lively agreed to star in this film just to prove she can actually act. And good for her for doing so. Personally, I already knew she was an above average eye-candy actress but just in case some of you didn't, she made this movie just for you. The film is emotional but doesn't hit you over the head with it a million times just to make a point of it. The special effects and shark are well done. And the plot is simple but entertaining. You'll enjoy it.",The Shallows
86,Seraphion,Missing something at the least,6,3 July 2016,"Nancy Adams go to a solo surf vacation to a beach where her mom used to surf in Mexico. But as the movie's trailer and promotion materials simply put, now there's something different on the beach. Bitten and having her body giving in to gangrene, she fought alone in avoiding the shark which is determined to eat her. But at the end she gains the courage to fight the predator back and win her life.As you ca see, I've decided to shorten my plot summary part for my movie reviews here as it would help me finish these posts quicker, LOL. Back to topic, The Shallows (2016) feels like a mix of a few different movies altogether. You'll definitely feel the Jaws (1965) mix, some degree of All is Lost (2013), and a hint of Soul Surfer (2011). But the thing is, having signatures of all those movies together didn't really help this movie's creators on how to incorporate them well and creating something new to see.We still get the usual dose of sex appeal, like if the audience are those who will only see this movie for Blake Lively's body. Also story- wise, the movie didn't really build it's background well. The buildup that's supposed to ground Nancy's will to fight, that she lost her mother and she's currently distancing herself from her family, didn't really connect to the story as a whole, as they're not well reinforced. The whole deal with the ride and the surf just takes the movie into a very slow pace that it got very hard for the movie to suddenly jump into the thriller parts.Speaking of the thriller parts, you don't get a fair amount of suspense from this movie. The thriller is mostly anticipation mood buildup where the saddening things mostly happen outside of the camera angle and we'll only see Nancy's reaction to it. There's just small amount of real shark fight moments that arouses our adrenaline. But in my opinion, the movie did well enough in setting up the flow after the buoy sequence kicks in. And the ending is something that is out of the classic shark movies.The acting overall is just a standard level performance, as it's all Blake Lively's scenes and she performed just at a standard level. The CGI feels quite nice as the movie adds in the nice placement, duration and camera angle considerations to keep the CGI just out of the keen eye's ability to discern it.My say for The Shallows (2016) is a 6 out of 10. Is it recommended? I think so, but only if you watch it for free, LOL, as the suspense level isn't as satisfactory as expected.",The Shallows
87,rgkarim,"Not Jaws, but Also Not Bad...minus the ending",7,24 June 2016,"The terror of the deep! An maw of endless fangs! There are endless descriptions for a way to describe a shark, the aquatic predator that we devote a whole week of cable programming to. Tonight we get the latest addition to the shark attack suspense genre entitled the Shallows. In today's modern world, shark attack movies have been trailing down the ridiculous path. It makes one wonder if we will ever get a serious shark flick able to compete with Jaws? So what is the verdict of this film? As always read on to find out. THE GOOD  Beautiful scenery  A good portrayal of living to your limits  Decent suspenseThe most majestic thing about the shallows is the beautiful scenery of the film location. Beaches with brilliant white sands lace a crystal clear lagoon, where reefs of varying hues make for a stunning view under the calm sky. Those who appreciate exotic lands and kicking visual effects will be happy with the high definition wonders on the big screen. Most guy audience members though will enjoy a different type of scenery in the form of Blake Lively navigating the waters in a fancy bikini. I think the camera men had a fixation on her behind, because the camera had a fixation with posterior end of our blonde heroine. With the visuals behind, the Shallows has painted a vivid picture of someone on the brink of death. Lively's character is pushed to her limits, forced to use ingenuity (and her convenient medical training) to survive on the desolate rock she is trapped on. It's intriguing to see all the things she dos to get back to shore, as well as see how her body changes as its exposed to the elements. Are some of the things over dramatic or convenient at times? Yes, but hey you sometimes have to stretch the truth when facing a gigantic, man-eating shark. Nevertheless, much of this movie's appealing factor is the suspense, as Lively's character tests luck and skills while traversing the reef. While seeing the same thing gets a bit dull (not to mention predictable) at times, the editing and music will build up enough tension to have many on the edge of their seats. I admit once or twice they led me into uncertain waters, unable to deduce what the fate of leading lady was.THE BAD  Repetitive and drawn out at times  Overdramatic moments  The endingWith survival movies, comes the expectation of slowness and the Shallows is no exception to the rule. Her battle against the shark is somewhat exciting, but that suspense starts to wane as she does the same thing over and over again. The movie has plenty of ""close call"" moments, often involve our bikini clad warrior falling into the water and flailing about before the CGI monster attempts to devour her. Between those moments, it's a lot of her just sitting on a rock, staring into the waters as she dehydrates in the sun. If that sounds exciting, then your heart will be pumping with glee. In addition to the repetitive scenes, The Shallows also dove into the overdramatic depths. Blake Lively does her role well, but the director had a thing for overdramatic flare. From slow motion diving under the waves to the super molasses like movements through the water, it's all drawn out to fill more screen time. It was the drawn out editing that probably gave the movie a majority of its length and it added very little to the story (which you've gotten like 70% of the movie from the trailers. Oh well, you get your 90 minutes worth. Perhaps the cheesiest part of this movie thoughis the ending. Okay, shark movies only have a few alleys to traverse in terms of the finale and many of them are melodramatic and ridiculous. This one though, well it was a little too much stretch of the imagination to stomach. After all the realistic survival instincts, our director/screenplay writers decided to defy physics with the dramatic climax that felt more of a quick wrap up. My fellow audience members all agreed on this, and wondered why such a hasty ending was their solution. It lacked emotion. It lacked satisfaction! Andit defied physics to my understanding. Oh well can't get them all right, but we can certainly do a little better than this. The VerdictWhen you go to see The Shallows, you are going to get exactly what you expect. It's a simplistic shark survival film with a pretty woman to fill the silver screen. Lively does a great a job with the center role, and she sold to me that she was suffering. Yet it was not enough to save me from a little boredom brought on by the repetitive fluff editing put in. Chances are you've seen about 60-70% of the movie from the trailers and unfortunately the ending doesn't pack the punch. Oh well at least it is only 90 minutes right? Is it worth a trip to the movie theater? Nope, but definitely catch it on shark week when it is sure to premier. My scores are: Drama/Horror/Thriller: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0",The Shallows
88,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Shallows,6,29 June 2016,"Jaume Collet-Serra is a capable director when it comes to keeping an audience involved and beguiled. I enjoyed two of his movies starring badass muse, Liam Neeson (Run All Night and 2014's Non-Stop). Now using lots of close-ups and plenty of slow motion shots, he wistfully reboots Jaws for the umpteenth time. Jaume sprinkles upon us, a little bit of Spielberg's monster hit, a little bit of Cast Away, a little bit of Open Water (2003), and a little bit of ""The Raft"" segment from 1987's Creepshow 2. The result is The Shallows, a conventional yet predictable flick that's stronger than most Peter Benchley sequels and a hundred times better than the critically panned Shark Night (I would hope so).With a spike in real-life great white attacks being posted all over social media these days, ""Shallows"" comes off as sort of relevant if not psychic. All I gotta say is dun dun, dun dun, dun dun dun dun dun dun (ha-ha).Filmed in Australia (which stands in as Mexico), distributed by Columbia Pictures, and clocking in at a paltry running time of 87 minutes, The Shallows is very small scale. With only 4 actors/actresses plus Sully the Seagull, it relegates as a one-woman show. The cinematography by Flavio Marinez Lebiano (he shot 2011's Unknown) is bright and gleaming despite the film's first act which feels like fodder for the tired, MTV generation. And of course there's nods to 1975's Jaws (as mentioned earlier). You have lead Blake Lively pointing a gun at a big ass shark saying, ""f*ck you"" (Roy Scheider says, ""smile you son of a bitch"") plus an obligatory cage match reminiscent of what Richard Dreyfuss went through 40+ years ago.In jest, ""Shallows"" isn't epic, won't blow your mind, and won't reinvent the ""don't go into the water"" wheel. It will however, somewhat channel your faith in the survival of the human spirit. The simple concept is there for the taking: One surfer girl, one monstrous ""sea dog"", mano a mano, and only 200 yards from shore. Heck, I'd pony up 5-10 dollars to see this thing at the local cineplex. Wait, I already did.Anyway, the story is as follows: Texas-born Nancy (played by Lively) is a medical student who loves to get on her board and carve up some bodacious waves. In the wake of her mother's death, she decides to go to a secluded beach where her mom once surfed after finding out she was pregnant with Nancy. Nance gets a ride to said beach from a local named Carlos (Oscar Jaenada). When she asks him what the name of the place is, he simply says it's ""paradise"". Nancy then runs into two other locals, surfs a few ripples with them, and after taking a breather, decides to go out for one more ride. Big Mistake. A great white shark is lurking in the water and it intends on attacking and killing Nancy if she doesn't get to land first. Serra films some excellent, initial surfing sequences whether it be the stunt people doing some tube riding or just barreling down the point break. And as for the ocean water featured in The Shallows, well it's beautiful in its midnight blue state and boy is it darn clear.Now performance-wise, I think Blake Lively does a decent job in ""Shallows"". Her Nancy gets put through the wringer whether it be her tearing some flesh on corral, getting stung by a jellyfish, or initially getting wounded by the shark thus spurring the notion of gangrene setting in. Nancy is obviously a goodhearted person and Lively channels the character well. Her virtuous voice and wholesome looks are a plus not to mention her ability to naturally convey fear, hope, and pain. Now do I think Lively can carry a movie all by herself? Yes, but only if it doesn't surpass an hour and a half.As for Jaume Collet-Serra's streamlined direction, well he keeps things moving despite a slight level of implausibility. For instance, Nancy stands on a small rock to try and avoid getting eaten by the shark. Huh? You'd think said shark would be able to just easily rise up and snatch her. On the other end of the spectrum, Serra effectively implores tactics to help Lively's persona fend for her life. You have the use of her necklaces and earrings to repair a wound, the timing of her stop watch to see how fast the menacing shark swims from point a to point b, and documentation on a helmet camera so that someone can call for help and save the stranded Nancy.In truth, the only thing I wish Jaume would stop doing in his films, is to use visible texts, visible skypes, and visible emojis as plot devices in order to tell his story. It all seems tired by now and rather clichéd. Oh and did I mention his ending to ""Shallows"" (spoiler)? Well it's pretty unjust in scope. You're telling me that a giant shark is gonna bite the dust after running into a couple of steel rods. Ten minutes earlier, that same shark was lit on fire and still galloped ferociously towards Lively's Nancy. Like I said unjust.Overall, The Shallows is passable entertainment that you'll probably forget about the minute the end credits roll. No matter. After seeing the disaster (ha-ha) that was Independence Day: Resurgence, I sort of needed this change of scenery. Rating: A ""waving"" 2 and a half stars.",The Shallows
89,Matt_Layden,"""What was once in the deep is now in the shallows""",7,23 June 2016,"Clocking in at a quick 87 minutes, The Shallows never strays from what it knows it is, a heart thumping survival flick. The plus side to the film is that it deals with a shark and Blake Lively in a bikini for the majority of the film. Still having difficulties with the loss of her mother to cancer, Nancy decides to put her medical schooling on hold to go globe trotting to a beautiful island her mother once went to. The perfect place to be at peace, surf and try not to get eaten by a shark. Nancy soon finds herself stranded on a rock, 200 yards away from the shore. With the shark circling her and the tide coming in, she only has so much time before hers runs out. Ryan Reynolds, not too long ago, did a one man show in the film Buried. Now it's his wife's turn as she has to hold this film on her shoulders. Can she carry a film? When most of the shots of her lean more towards eye-candy, I'll say she serves her purpose. But, I don't want to undermine her like that. She was surprisingly good in The Town and I really like the film The Age of Adeline. Her she is relegated to screaming, talking to herself and at the end of the day....look good. She does this and while she doesn't blow anyone away with her acting abilities here, she manages to do the material justice. Is the film scary? Not really, but it does have at least one good jump moment. I didn't feel the dread as much as the filmmakers would have wanted me to. The tension on the other hand, is indeed there. How is she going to make it out alive? Will she? What will be left of her is she makes it to the shore? A lot of questions will run through your mind when she is stuck on that rock. The Shallows is essentially a B-Movie with a Hollywood make-over. The main draw of the flick is the shark, not much else. The film tries to give a bit of depth to our lead character, but it's extremely cookie-cutter at best. Her family drama stalls the film a bit, which is a bad thing when the film is so short. Chalk that up to mediocre writing. Unfortunately the film has some pretty awful CGI that takes you out of the experience. Specifically, I caught myself laughing at moments when Lively was ""surfing"", yet it's clearly someone else and her face CGI'd on top. Then the shark itself is hit or miss. When it jumps out of the water to attack people, it's laughable. Yet when it is underwater and we see it from above, it's really menacing. The film excels with the make-up though, creating some great work on Lively for her injuries. Horror desperately needs to go back to basics, cause it works well. With a goofy ending, The Shallows falls a hair short of being a classic shark flick. It's a decent summer film that will keep you thrilled no doubt, but it will have to sit at the back of the bus with Jaws driving and Deep Blue Sea sitting near the front.",The Shallows

The films premise is simple but has more skill than meets the eye!The kills were pretty decent as with the shark (which was CGI) & the suspense in the film as a whole really drew you in I felt this as I kept watching & waiting for something to happen as it did & got better & better throughout! The Shark was vicious & really aggressive which made this film really good as I was a bit worried about how much of the shark would be shown in the film! I also liked the blood effects too & was pretty decent for a shark film! The ending was truly epic & something I didn't see coming! but judging by the scoring I knew something great was about to happen!I overall would give this film a 9/10 it truly was a really suspenseful film which loads of things going on! It kept you locked in til the end when it got going that is! I'd say this was best shark film I'd seen since Shark Night 3D & Bait, both of which were epic shark films, even that of Sharktopus which was also a great shark film!I recommend seeing this film from the director of House of Wax! It was really that good! 9/10",The Shallows
92,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"For the most part, riveting",8,23 June 2016,"I have a couple of issues with this film (occasionally too much CGI, and a weird ending) but for the majority of its brief, 86-minutes-long run, this is a riveting film, exquisitely filmed in the Gold Coast of Australia, about a survivor of a shark attack clinging to life, figuratively and literally, on the side of a rock 200 feet from shore, with the shark still circling the waters. Normally watered down PG13-rating gives way to some surprisingly grisly bursts of gore, as she tries to suture her wounds with makeshift surgical tools, and a couple of brutal attack scenes. The film makes the most of a small cast, and Blake Lively carries the film almost entirely herself, spending at least two thirds of the film completely isolated. Well, she's not completely alone, she also has Steven ""Sully"" Seagull, as himself.",The Shallows
93,Chase_Witherspoon,Soul surfer meets 127 hours,6,26 December 2016,"A true shark movie that threatens to be better than the rest, and whilst to some degree it out performs most of its peers, it just can't overcome the CGI scourge that ultimately spoils its authenticity. Blake is lively though not expansive enough in her acting range to carry a thriller on her own. The behemoth that pursues her looks good in close ups and stock footage, but yet again just when you've suspended disbelief and in the grip of fear, the juxtaposition in the animation effects lets you off the hook and back to the safety of your seat. A superior shark movie imo (e.g. 12 Days of Terror, The Reef, Dark Tide) doesn't lose your trust the way The Shallows relaxes its grip when it's antagonist fails to seamlessly synchronise with the environment. Unfortunately as a result, the attack scenes mostly miss the mark and don't appear natural (when does one shark attack and devour multiple people in quick succession?), though the suspense is certainly present in the pacing and timing. The idea of the rogue shark stalking prey in the isolated cove is explained (or perhaps contrived) and so the survival match at least has a plot basis on which to unfold. From this survivalist perspective, the film works and keeps you engaged as Lively employs her limited resources to countenance the great white terror whose scale is by the way, not unrealistic (though still of school bus proportions) . Overall, pleasant scenery, decent sound & visual effects (notwithstanding the CGI) but it doesn't rise beyond B-grade to beckon a second viewing.",The Shallows
94,moviewizguy,A solid B-movie,7,15 September 2016,"People often underestimate or under-appreciate the ability to produce a genuinely good B-movie. There's Renny Harlin on one end of the spectrum, making crap like The Legend of Hercules, 12 Rounds, and The Covenant. But then you have someone like Jaume Collet-Serra, who knows a thing or two about framing a scene, getting good performances from his actors, and above all, making an entertaining movie.The Shallows could have been an otherwise conventional and forgettable thriller without Collet-Serra's strong and stylish direction. For example, the scene when Blake Lively's character first gets attacked by the shark is beautifully composed - in one unbroken take, no less - and legitimately nightmarish, with the red blood slowly overtaking the blue screen. It also doesn't hurt that Lively successfully carries the entire film on her shoulders, giving what is arguably the best performance in her career to date. There's a quiet fierceness and admirability to her character that makes it easy to root for her survival.Overall, there's a lot to like about The Shallows. It's gorgeously shot, suspenseful, emotionally gratifying, and entirely successful on what it sets out to be - a solid B-movie, and it takes skill to pull that off. Sure, it doesn't match the heights of either Gravity or The Martian, but then again, its budget is a mere fraction of what those films cost.",The Shallows
95,tomsview,Just when you thought it was safe,8,5 December 2016,"For once, a trailer that didn't over-sell the finished product. The story is simple. Nancy Adams (Blake Lively) travels to a remote beach in Mexico to surf alone - not a good idea if you remember the old rules about never swimming straight after a big lunch or by yourself. Anyway, with no more than 10-minutes of back-story, she ends up on a rock, bleeding, and hunted by a great white shark.Even a bad director could probably make this work, but Juame Collet-Serra is a good one, and he makes this duel between girl and shark as riveting a horror movie as we've seen in a long time.Nancy is no pushover, she's a medical student and although she's dropped out for a while, she knows her stuff. Without spoiling things too much, like Matt Damon in ""The Martian"", Nancy sciences the sh*t out of her situation.Collet-Serra wisely holds the shark back until our imaginations are working overtime, and when he does present him it is about the best one we have seen in a movie. I must admit every time I see ""Jaws"" I can't help noticing that weird hinged mouth on the shark. Spielberg made his movie before CGI could have solved that problem.However, half of any good shark movie is what you don't see.If the movie reminds me of any other it is ""The Reef"", an Aussie movie based on a real event. If you haven't seen it, and if ""The Shallows"" whets your appetite for bikinis vs sharks, then ""The Reef"" should be your next movie.Living in Australia, I know the shudder that goes through you when you are out a bit from the beach and the shark alarm sounds. I've experienced it a couple of times, and on each occasion I'm sure Michael Phelps would have had a hard time keeping up with me as I headed in. Just the thought of sharks can have that effect and ""The Shallows"" plays on that fear big time.I haven't read too many reviews about this movie, and I wouldn't bother with a negative one. It's for those who want the vicarious thrill of escaping the gaping mouth of a great white shark without the discomfort of sand in your swimming costume or the need to apply SPF50+ sunscreen.",The Shallows
96,michaeltrivedi,Not Bad,7,10 September 2020,"I liked this movie a lot actually. It was basically only in one location. I love survival movies like this.

97,Screen_Blitz,This creature feature is not Jaws but it's definitely packs the thrills,8,27 June 2016,"Many have wondered if the shark-thriller genre would ever get revived again. After the remarkable success of Steven Spielberg's Jaws back in the mid-70s, there led a long string of shark flicks, both in the theatrical and Made-For-TV category, tried to emulate the arresting value of the summer masterpiece. 'Deep Blue Sea', 'Shark Night', 'Piranha', 'Shark Attack', 'Sharknado', the list goes on. None of which managed to pull to the genre to the surface, or even reach remotely close to the heights of 'Jaws'. Jaume-Collet Serra, however, surprises us with a spine-chilling shark thriller that shows though the genre may have sunk below the surface, it's not completely out of fuel yet. Supplemented with an engrossing script by Anthony Jaswinski and an ambitious performance by Blake Lively, this survival thriller is an unexpected thrill ride. Blake Lively plays Nancy, a Texas medical school dropout vacations to a Mexican beach to surf, contributing to the memory of her late mother. Below the clear sunny skies and the warm temperatures, what can possibly go wrong? That is until a great white shark arrives and sinks it's teeth in her, leaving a bloody gash on her leg. Stranded on an isolated rock 200 yards away from shore, Nancy must put her intelligence to the test to survive while figuring out a way to make off the rock surrounded by the shark who desperately waits to have the poor girl for lunch. Jaume-Collet Serra, director of films such as horror-thriller 'Orphan', the cheesy but entertaining thriller 'Non-Stop' and the tense actioner 'Run All Night', acquires a true sense of suspense and tension in this survival flick, and though the film doesn't go down without it's blemishes; the result is surprisingly effective. The film stars Blake Lively who takes on a daunting task of carrying the movie on her shoulders with not much support other than a few minor characters who each only get a finger scoop of screen time. And much with great effort, she succeeds. This actress shines in her role and quickly grows into a character you come to care for. From the effectively constructed suspense and the tension that pervades in the woman's desperate battle against the terrifying sea creature in the means of life or death, you genuinely fear for her survival. Every time you see a underwater shot hinting a close proximity between the main character and the shark, it leaves you squirming in your seat, and scenes don't need a suspenseful music score to complete the scariness. Though the film moves at a steadily slow pace and borrows a few elements from Danny Boyle's '127 Hours' such as the main character recording a message for her family via video camera, it delivers just about everything it needs to make a purely effective fare. The Shallows is no Jaws, but it is a thoroughly entertaining and heart-pump thriller that packs plenty of thrills. While I can't say it completely revives the shark genre, it shows the category is safe from it's grave. Those looking for a scary, suspenseful good time, this one if not The Conjuring 2, makes a good summer pick.",The Shallows

99,antoniotierno,Visual masterpiece but extremely unlikely as well,6,26 August 2016,"The Shallows is another entry in that genre—a ""survival thriller"" about an epic battle of survival taking place between an American woman, Nancy Adams (Blake Lively), and a vicious shark. The Shallows is categorized as a ""suspense thriller,"" and suspenseful it certainly is. It has certainly taken the lessons of Jaws and made them his own, understanding and employing to great effect, the power of the shark's-eye-view of a human frolicking on the surface of the water. On top of that it adds a lot of lush and masterful cinematography. This is a movie, of course, about a lady-surfer and you would expect a certain amount of lady-surfer-in-her-bathing-suit images but the main fact here is that the images The Shallows serves up aren't just remarkably sexualized, they're also remarkably violent.",The Shallows

The movie was completely based on a situation where your skills places an advantage to survive. ""The Shallows"" is one such film which has been brilliantly shot with commendable performances.""The Shallows"" tells the story of Nancy, who gets attack by a shark while surfing in a lonely beach of Mexico. She survives the first attack but is unfortunately stuck on a rock place 200 meters away from sea shore. She must use all her skills and will-power to swim back to shore before the high tide takes over the rocky place giving an edge to shark to attack her once again.From the director of ""Unknown"",""Non-Stop"" and ""Orphan"", Jaume Collet-Serra creates a different film on a shark attack. ""The Shallows"" is not just a mere shark attack film like ""Jaws"" or ""Deep Blue Sea"" but more about Nancy's struggle and using all her survival strategy to come out alive from the deadliest attack. Hats off to Jaume Collet-Serra for building a unique concept and keeping the audience glued to the screen with admiring direction. Full marks to cinematographer Flavio Martínez Labiano for capturing the beautiful stunts of surfing and exotic location. It is definitely eye- catching. Screenplay is and will not bore you for a second. The first half is decent but it is second half which is highlight of the film with nail-biting moments. CGI is brilliant along with soothing background score building tension around. Blake Lively shines as Nancy. The gorgeous actress emotes expressively and has all the traits to become the next big thing.So, overall, ""The Shallows"" is a definite watch which has enough nail biting moments to keep you at bay.",The Shallows

About survival, being scared, skills, faith, hope, courage, fear, compassion. There are not too much people or things, but enough. The shark looks real, the probability looks bit unreal or too lucky, the shark's long presence in one spot in water and attack on large objects for so long time looks unreal to me. I expected I will see presence of more people in the end. Bit too lucky, too little things, and bit unrealistic. But looks real, detailed, nicely recorded. Just not enough content to be regarded as best movie. Looks like this is more about empathy and compassion and faith rather than survival. It motivates us to not be ignorant of others needing our help, and to have faith and not give up. Good motivation for medical students. Similar to many survival water movies like ones about sharks and pool accidents, none of which I currently remember unfortunately.",The Shallows
103,blott2319-1,Dumb slasher film that kind of works in a strange way,6,3 August 2020,"I think one of the struggles that modern shark movies have is that we know so much more about this breed of fish at this point. There is an entire week on one cable network every year that is entirely devoted to the exploration of sharks. Jaws was the progenitor of this genre so it gets a pass. It seems that Jaws lit a fire under the entire world to know more about sharks, but now that we do, it's hard to buy into a movie where a shark is behaving like an insane serial killer. The Shallows attempts to throw an explanation at the audience in the laziest way possible, and I think it's actually worse for even trying. But if you abandon all reason, and just accept that in a movie it can make sense for an angry shark to hover around one spot in order to hopefully murder a young surfer who has been stranded in the water, then perhaps you can enjoy this film. I'd say, even though The Shallows has the tone of a more serious film, you need to approach it like a slasher horror movie, and see Blake Lively as your prototypical ""final girl.""I was surprised how much tension I actually felt for Blake Lively in this film. They do a nice job of putting her in a no-win scenario, and placing her at the mercy of the serial-killer shark. I thought the effects were surprisingly good, and she was excellent at portraying the pain from her wounds. However, I did feel that later they glossed over a lot of the pain and suffering for the sake of convenience. I recognize that adrenaline can empower people to do unbelievable things, but it seems utterly ridiculous that this character is able to swim with her normal efficiency despite starving, heat exhaustion, traumatic injuries, and severe loss of blood. Thankfully, I found a way to connect with the character, which allowed my brain to ignore some of the red lights that were coming up when the movie defied logic. There's something compelling about one woman's battle against an evil force that is trying to kill her, and it makes The Shallows more entertaining than it would be otherwise. There were actually moments that I held my breath in fear while watching it, which I think is a great sign.",The Shallows
104,PartialMovieViewer,Shark Movie and Seagull Friend,2,8 November 2016,"Next to the worst movies I've wasted money on, this one is really not too bad. Oh who am I kidding...this is flick is a 'must-miss.' I don't know what is going on with writers, directors and actors, now-a-days, but the story-line is really bad. What were they thinking. It's almost like, ""The Shallows"" tries to mix scary elements from the classic 'Jaws', with peppy, jovial Disney-like interactions between humans and dancing animated singing animals. If only the seagull was hand drawn; sang cute, snappy songs, and told sick jokes...then the saga would be complete. Did I waste money? Well yes I did. This movie is so bad on many levels. This production was not a complete loss. Thanks to this snore-fest, I have come to the determination that Blake Lively should never do another one-person show. One person shows are way above her. This movie was a waste for me...too bad to",The Shallows
105,RforFilm,"With a simple goal in mind (DON'T GET EATEN), The Shallows is the best shark movie since Jaws",9,1 July 2016,"It's kind of a coincidence (or perfect timing) that The Shallows should come out during the same time as Shark Week on the Discovery Channel. Though I'm not usually one for nature documentaries, I might occasionally sit down for a bit to see what's going on with a great white or a tiger shark during that summer week. Like a lot of people, I find the idea of sharks in the water terrifying. The creatures are basically living dinosaurs with their only key instinct is to survive by hunting. The idea of encountering one while snorkeling still gives me nightmares.What's interesting is that out of the hundreds of shark movies that have been made for television and the occasional Hollywood produced features, the only genuinely good one happens to be the Steven Spielberg classic Jaws. When you really look at that movie again, it's nothing more then a B-movie that was simply done extremely well. Most shark movies will either just do Jaws again (with a lower budget and bad actors) or try to add scientific or science-fiction elements that give sharks a reason to attack people. The Shallows is a nice change of pace by going back to a simple goal in shark movies; don't get eaten.Off of the coast of Mexico, a medical student Nancy (played by Blake Lively) is being taken to a secluded beach by a resident who refuses to say the name of the beach, only calling it paradise. With her family back in Texas and her friend still at a hotel, she's making her surfing afternoon on her own. The majority of her day consisted of hitting the waves, calling her sister, and even meeting two other surfers. When she's about take one last surf before the sun sets, she encounters a dead whaleand a great white.The shark takes a bite of her leg and tries to pull her down, but she makes it to a rock formation where she makes a tourniquet to stop the bleeding. The distance to the beach is too far to swim without risking another attack and the other surfers have gone home, so she's stuck there with a hurt seagull as her only companion. Attempts to get the attention of a drunk and the returning surfers only result in them getting attacked by the monster. As time runs out on the increasing tide, she has to use her wits to save herself.I cannot believe that after forty years after Jaws, we finally have another good shark movie! The Shallows may be a simple film, but it takes it's simplicity to terrifying advantages and creates an open yet claustrophobic thriller. It understands that what we don't see is what scares us the most. Whenever we don't see the shark, we get to know a lot about Nancy and how she tries to use her studies of medicine and surfing to see if she can strategize around this animal. When we do catch a glimpse, they make sure that the shark is big, menacing, and ready for the hunt on it's human.The Shallows plays like a one-man showor in this case, a one-woman show. The good news is that Blake Lively is an actress that can carry an entire movie. She may be pretty, but you can capture her thoughts straight through her eyes, even as the sun glares. Making her smart was one thing, but they found the right balance to make her feel vulnerable. The writing thankfully stays simple as they might give us more insight into Nancy, but the goal is still not being eaten by the shark.I'll give this nine surfboards with a shark bite out of ten. I highly recommend The Shallows as a small, but effective thriller. The summer may have gotten people to go to the beaches, but after seeing this, they may finding themselves staying out of the water.",The Shallows

107,juliankennedy23,Staying in the Shallow End.,7,17 February 2017,"If you ever wondered what would happen if Asylum gave someone talented the $8.60 to make a SyFy movie. And that person actually hired other people who were talented, and sticking with the stringent parameters of the Syfy channel (must have a girl in a bikini and a shark preferably a giant flying one) made a movie. Well, wonder no more. The Shallows is an Asylum movie with good CGI, effective direction, gorgeous cinematography, talented acting and a serviceable script.The lack of campiness in the movie is actually a smidge of a drawback as one takes very seriously what is essentially a shark attack movie. And since we take the movie seriously its third act flaws are only more apparent. If the movie was staying true to its tone it certainly should have opted for a darker more realistic ending. Instead, it goes off the rails with a shark that turns into Jason Voorhees and a heroine that might as well be holding a chainsaw.I liked the seagull and I have never found Blake Lively more appealing and I find her ability to wear a bikini bottom the entire movie somewhat brave. The wife was convinced it was Chris Cooper as the father but it turns out it is Brett Cullen who is a by appearances a discount Chris Cooper. He needs to ask for more money.I am pretty sure abandoned surf beaches in Mexico lack both Uber service let alone such good cell phone service. I am also positive that most sharks would ignore you with such a big easy meal floating 50 yards away. All that said the film is very well done and acted and while the story doesn't include a flying giant octopus or comic relief I think it would make a good Syfy movie. A very good one indeed.",The Shallows
108,Anurag-Shetty,"A shark movie, on par with Jaws(1975).",10,18 September 2016,"The Shallows tells the story of Nancy(Blake Lively). Nancy is a girl, who loves surfing. She is holidaying on a mostly uninhabited, beautiful island in Mexico. While surfing close to the shore, Nancy is attacked by a great white shark. Now, it is up to Nancy to use all her courage, skills & will to find her way back to shore, without being devoured by the massive great white shark. The Shallows is like being on an extremely thrilling roller-coaster ride. You have no idea what's going to happen next. The twists & turns of the film, will keep your eyes glued to the screen. In fact, this film is so fast paced that if you blink, you might miss something important. Director Jaume Collet-Serra has made another unforgettable film just like his previous directorial efforts, Orphan(2009) & Non-Stop(2014) to name a few. The cinematography by Flavio Martinez Labiano perfectly captures the island in all its glory. I love all the various close-ups of Nancy's watch, which definitely increases the growing feeling of dread, the movie is going for. The visual effects department has done a fantastic job, creating a realistic looking shark. The highlight of the film is Blake Lively. Lively carries the movie on her shoulders. She has portrayed the various emotions Nancy goes through, with ease & aplomb. This is Blake Lively's best performance of her career, so far. Sully Seagull is adorable as the Seagull. Oscar Jaenada is amazing as Carlos. Brett Cullen & Sedone Legge are great as Dad & Chloe, respectively. The supporting cast is awesome.

Some scenes are brilliantly done and I was very impressed with the CGI and makeup. Blake Lively is a decent choice in the lead role and, although she can be a bit corny at times, I felt she gave a very believable performance.The setting is beautiful and the film is wonderfully shot. I wasn't much of a fan of the inserted modern tech graphics however; it just seems like they cheapen the production value and will cause the film to become dated quicker. I also didn't care for the backstory; it was unnecessary and highly unoriginal. There is enough substance here to do away with backstory altogether. The final downside was the over-the-top ending, which was also unnecessary and corny. It would have been fine to just have her rescued after a few days of battling to stay alive.I felt like this was close to being a masterpiece but was let down by some errors in the writing. It would have worked perfectly as minimalist realism but was injected with superfluous distractions that heavily detracted from the authenticity of the movie.

The Shallows exist near the bottom of the list with Blake Lively fighting for survival after a shark. Lively stars as Nancy, a medical school student who has decided to take off from class to travel after the death of her mother. She seeks out the Mexican beach her mother visited when she found out she was pregnant. It is an isolated location and when Nancy's friend excuses herself due to a hangover, Nancy proceeds to go alone. Nancy shows off her surfing skill to a pair of surfers, one of whom wears a head cam to record his stunts. There is a prologue that introduces the threat with this head cam and the shark that doesn't show up nearly early enough. These shots give a bit away that didn't necessary add much to the story. Nancy stays out later than the other surfers and paddles her surfboard towards the carcass of a whale.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",The Shallows
113,jrarichards,"Solid piece of work, and pretty atmospheric",8,23 February 2017,"Those of us who love the sea and admire it also fear it. The two emotions are entirely inseparable, because only human beings with too much temerity really claim to feel completely at home in the water, and none of us really and fully does.Here Blake Lively's character Nancy is certainly at the competent end of the scale, as clearly an experienced and resourceful, meticulous and careful surfer come down to Mexico to recall and somehow relive time spent on a secluded and exquisite beach with her late mother. Her awareness and good sense is further boosted by her status as a medical student (albeit apparently a lapsed/disillusioned one).Nancy therefore knows better than most what somehow we all know - even from a few minutes spent paddling, that water is wet and often cold (even in Mexico, at least at night), while most inanimate things that we make contact with as we flail about in our moments of aquatic clumsiness tend to be sharp, pointy, abrasive, hard, sticking out where we would prefer them not to, and so on. And that's just the rocks, bits of glass, flotsam and jetsom and metal items. Let's not even start with the array of prickly, spiny, bitey, stingy, well-toothed and just downright venomous forms of life that are likely to be present! So we've been warned. This is not our place, and - as the great ""Open Water"" and the separate ""Open Water 2"" made clear, it's easy to get stuck in it, ""out of our depth"" in every sense, too clumsy and inept even to do anything to right an overturned boat.Naturally, there's more than a hint of both of these films in ""The Shallows"", which certainly does not surpass those predecessors, but does start as it means to go on with a clever name, given that there is far less fear in this title than in its opposite - Peter Benchley's ""The Deep"" (successor to the immortal ""Jaws""). Everybody fears the abyss, but what could possibly go wrong in a few feet of clear, calmish, sunlit water just yards off a comforting-looking sunkissed shore? In fact, plenty can and does go wrong, but to further set up the contrast, the makers of ""The Shallows"" toy with the audience in the first part of the film, teasing us ever-so-slightly erotically (though not exploitatively) with the first moments of entry into the warm, sunlit, blue waters and sparkling white surf by our beautiful and seductively bikini- and wetsuit-clad star. For seconds, we might actually be persuaded that Nancy is some kind of ""mermaid"" who can truly be at home here...Given also the techniques used to display Nancy's text messages on the big screen, as well as her first contacts with two lads whose boards are already out there among the waves, we at times look perilously close to a teens-on-the-beach kind of movie, and doubtless that is just the effect Director Jaume Collet-Serra intends. But, while there is the odd later moment of cliché, the rest of the film stands in total contrast to this start, and that's clever enough.Since Lively is on her own for virtually the whole film, certain (reasonable-enough) devices like her talking to herself and to an injured gull are deployed - on the whole to good effect. One can fully empathise with a stranded person's desire to chat (occasionally even joke) with an equally immobilised seabird! It's essentially human.The rest of the local wildlife is obviously far less friendly, hence the need for an injured Nancy to ponder endlessly how she might get back across the short distance separating her from the beach. While ""Jaws"" has its (often strained) camaraderie between the shark-trackers, here it's Nancy and her gull, and that's quite a bit of responsibility for Blake Lively to take on. But mostly she does it well. Rightly, one believes (given the storyline) her character is old and wise beyond its years, but also gutsy, innovative and determined. The fact that this is still not enough to make the water safe or friendly is a worthwhile message made well, with Nancy's discomfiture portrayed adequately enough for most of us out here in audience-land to go ""ouch"" on many occasions. Bravely and maturely, the star also allows some shots of her tired, strained, careworn, parched-yet-wet face that are the total antithesis of publicity shots. I admired this, I must say, and if Lively seeks to be an actress of stature, well in my view she's on her way.As was intended, ""The Shallows"" comes over as a pared-down-to-the-basics but mostly well (occasionally beautifully) portrayed tale of human fear and terror in ostensibly rich and welcoming surroundings. It reminds us at the same time of human resourcefulness and courage, if firmly and rightly based on the aforementioned acknowledgment that - barring those few precious seconds of riding the waves - we can never be more than inefficient interlopers in the marine environment.",The Shallows

No sense in pointing out some of the non-believable scenes here - quite a few critics have already done that on IMDb. What I'd like to talk about is scenery.It wasn't until reading the credits at the end of the movie when I found out that it wasn't filmed in Mexico but Australia. That sure was one mighty fine beach. I liked the added colours they swept in to make the blues, yellows and reds of the pristine water shimmer. I think that was worth some of the price of admission. The story? Not so much.

115,bob-the-movie-man,The Deathly Shallows (Part 1),8,29 August 2016,"Every shark movie is inevitably compared (unfavourably) against Spielberg's classic 1975 tourist-muncher. And ""The Shallows"" is no exception. But while not a 10-star classic, this flick comes pretty close by being hugely enjoyable and having a lot going for it.Blake Lively (""The Age of Adeline"") plays surfer and trainee doctor Nancy, still grieving the recent death from cancer of her mother and travelling to a remote Mexican surf beach where she has photos of her mother surfing while pregnant with her. While surfing alone, Nancy is attacked a couple of hundred yards from the shore by a Great White and severely injured. She has the choice of refuge of either a low rock or another less palatable floating object. Choosing the rock (at low tide) she is faced with the dilemma of both surviving her injuries and then being rescued before the high tide takes the rock and leaves her to the mercy of the ever circling big-fish.A big summer blockbuster this is not, with a total cast of eleven (not including a guest appearance of Steven Seagull (as himself)). But the small cast doesn't make it less gripping, and gripping it most certainly is, with tension building progressively (emphasised periodically by an on-screen clock) with the countdown to high tide.Blake Lively is an underrated actress and really delivers the goods here. And bearing in mind the problems that Spielberg had with his mechanical shark Bruce (named after Spielberg's lawyer) the appearance of the shark is limited to where actually needed, with Lively having to fill in the blanks with reaction shots. As your imagination is still far better than any special effects, this is hugely effective for certain sequences.The film draws similarities to another interesting entry in the ""Jaws"" genre – ""Open Water 2: Adrift"" from 2006. In that film there was the same incessant threat of shark attack combined with the audience frustration that safety (in that case, the deck of their yacht, if only they had let a ladder down) being so near. Here the 200 yards to the shore is shoutable to but still 190 yards too far.The cinematography (by Flavio Martínez Labiano) is also just beautifully done with some stunning surf and underwater shots that not only highlight Ms Lively's lithely (sic) figure and her Californian surfing skills, but also the beauty of the 'Mexican coast' (actually Lord Howe Island in New South Wales, Australia).""The Shallows"" was written by Anthony Jaswinski and directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (the director of ""Non-Stop"", aka Taken 3.5). It comes with a truly impressive BvS quotient of just 5.9%! (see the bob-the-movie-man.com glossary!)So with all of this going for it, you would think that my rating is heading towards at least a 9. But all films like this require a satisfying denouement, and unfortunately this is where this one comes off the rails. It is just plain silly and, together with an unnecessary and irritating epilogue scene, diminishes what was on track to be one of the best films of the summer. So here's the ""One Mann's Movies"" solution:Using Final Cut X, Adobe Premier or your favourite video editing suite, cut out the scene from 115:00 to 116:00 from ""Jaws""; Photoshop Blake Lively's face onto Roy Scheider's body. Insert the finished clip into ""The Shallows"" at about 82 minutes in. Enjoy a 10-star classic!This limitation aside, it's still worth your while hunting it out at a cinema near you, since the fantastic cinematography is best suited to a big screen.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

116,AngelHonesty,"Unrealistic, but Entertaining. Blake Lively Rocks her Role",8,6 January 2021,"The only reason this movie is great, Blake Lively. There are very little lines in the film, not a ton of action or things for Blake to do, but somehow with her facial expressions of fear and terror along with her strength and will to live brings the movie to life. I loved the filming of the beach and water and that most of the movie was not CGI making it feel more real. Some of the shark scenes were bad CGI, but only a few. Most of the movie does not make logical sense. Such as the sharks bite being more deadly for some people and not for others. Or how the shark seems to keep getting bigger. Or how the shark can jump and do crazy things, but other times cant. There aren't very many good shark movies out there, its hard to be picky when watching one, even though The Shallows is flawed I enjoyed the film a lot.",The Shallows
117,bryank-04844,'The Shallows' is shallow.,3,23 January 2017,"Note to filmmakers: When you make a movie, DON'T use slow motion for over 80% of your film, especially in the horror/thriller genre. It takes the audience out of the moment, as is the horrid case with the new killer shark movie 'The Shallows'. After sleeping on it for a night, this film might be one of the worst and silliest films to come out this year. It's terrible filmmaking on just about every level. It's poorly written, poorly shot, and doesn't make a lick of sense. Blake Lively, who plays a young woman named Nancy, does a decent enough job with the material she's given, but after reading the screenplay, I would have walked far away from this film and never looked back, even if I got to go to Australia for a few weeks and film.There's just so much wrong with this movie, it's hard to decipher where to begin, but as a charming nun/babysitter said, ""Let's start at the very beginning."" We first meet Nancy (Lively) as she is being driven to a remote beach to surf while she is on vacation. It is implied that she dropped out of med school after her mother died of cancer (a horrible side story full of cheese). She's being driven through a beautiful part of the forest to get to this amazing paradise view, but you wouldn't know it, because the director has Nancy texting her friend the whole time, while the screen captions are displayed largely on the screen at all times in real time.The stupid thing about this is that the camera even shows the actual phone screen in frame as well through all of this. We just miss out on all the supposed beautiful shots and cinematography. After a few minutes of this, Nancy is in the water by herself, surfing the big waves, which is when everything become slow motion for the duration of the film. Her hair flings back with water, the waves crash down, and some average surfing maneuvers are all shown in slow motion. I'm convinced that the writer and director here only had enough material for about twenty minutes of film, but made it in slow-motion to drag it out to just over 80-minutes. I'm not kidding.Soon enough, a big killer shark chomps Nancy on the leg, the blood starts flowing, and she swims over to a nearby small rock for safety, which is about 200 yards from the beach. This is where Nancy stays basically for the duration of the film by herself. Well not really by herself, there is a seagull she names Stephen on the rock with her, who was also injured in the shark attack. No, I'm not making this up. A few people walk by on the beach, but are attacked and killed by the shark, leaving poor Nancy stranded on the rock. Nothing seems to go her way either as she talks to herself or really us, the audience in everything that she does. It's quite annoying and everything just gets sillier and dumber all the way up to the final credits of the movie.Do I have anything good to say about this movie? Minor things, I guess, including some good use of practical blood effects and a few minor suspenseful scenes with the shark, but that's about it. From Nancy's phone getting internet access on the remote beach in the middle of nowhere, to the seagull that always seems to have the answer, to the 'JAWS' wink where Nancy tells the shark to go screw itself as she shoots a gun - it all just falls insanely flat and makes you roll your eyes and wish you hadn't spend 80 minutes watching this movie.",The Shallows
118,witster18,normally a 90-minute expose' featuring blake lively's back-side would get a higher score from me..,6,29 September 2016,"Perhaps the problem that it's made so blatantly obvious that this is the films best asset.It's glistening and wet from the 10-minute mark until the credits roll. Ryan is one lucky man no doubt.Now for everything else:""The Shallows"" contains some passable acting, decent shark effects, and some really nice cinematography(all assets aside). Past that, it IS pretty shallow indeed.Moments for dialog and character development are cast away, and there seems to be some problems with the timeline and struggles of our protagonist here. It's a pretty hungry shark. Gorging him/herself on a dying whale, 3 full- grown humans, and still wants Blake for dessert apparently. The film just misses some opportunities. She could have had some good dialog with the other surfers, and that certainly could have added some impact when they were eaten, but maybe that was just asking too much. I'll be honest with you - I don't think Blake is the best actress in the world. She's not terrible, but when asked to give an ""All is Lost"" type of solo performance, it's just asking a bit much here, imo. Also, I didn't care for the ending. From the way she was found, where she was found, and the short Hollywood scene that followed, it just seemed like the rest of the film,... safe.. and a little void.So the best thing about ""The Shallows"" is the vibrant look of the film, the scenery within(including Blake), and there's really little else going-on here. Much of the film's timeline leaves a little to be desired;the realism, impact, and all circumstances involved with it just doesn't work very well. Again, Blake isn't a terrible actress, but it's pretty obvious here that the film-makers knew what they wanted to focus-on, and spent little time on everything else. A little more lead-up, with more dialog, and more dialog with the surfers, better timeline explanation, more realistic circumstances, ixnay the Hollywood last 3 minutes, perhaps a little more background on her mother.. I could go on and on, but let's just round this up and say it's decent, looks great, but is ultimately quite forgettable.I'm teetering on 6 here because I can think of worse ways to spend 90 minutes, than staring at Blake Lively's derriere. Alright fine... I'm switching to a 6, because I can't get the picture out of my head, but it's probably a 5. I'd watch it again. Did I mention it was forgettable? Well, somewhat. She's smokin' hot. The film is Luke-warm.Needed more background for her and her mother, and some dialog with the other surfers could have gone a long, long way.",The Shallows

There is only so much you can do with a shark movie but this still manages to entertain despite the relative predictability of it. It's well filmed and makes the most of a beautiful setting. There is some decent tension built up and some predictably bloody deaths. There are some nice touches done with the local wildlife of jellyfish,dolphins and gulls which all helps you keep your interest and makes you forget you've seen this all before. This is an entertaining and decent entry into the shark movie genre and worth watching with a couple of beers on a Saturday night.",The Shallows

121,msbreviews,Rating: B-,6,6 August 2017,"Is it the best shark movie since Jaws? Yes ... and no. The Shallows is, in my opinion, the best ""shark-movie"" that I've seen since the one directed by the great Steven Spielberg! However, that's not saying much since there aren't any decent movies involving sharks since then. It has some great exciting details, but some other big issues that I'm going to discuss below.I need to begin with Blake Lively. She has one of her best (if not the best) performances in this film and she needed to be at the top of her game since she was basically the only human character that mattered. She was able to transmit all of the emotions that one would feel in a situation like that (fear, pain, vulnerability) and, most importantly, she made me care for her. In a contained movie like this, with only one character to worry about, if the audience member doesn't feel like the protagonist is human enough, then the whole thing crumbles. Not in this case, she's the main reason why I actually enjoyed this movie.The CGI shark is amazing, really well defined, as well as the rest of the environment. Jaume Collet-Serra could have done a better job. He tries to elevate the excitement of this film to a certain level that he's never able to reach due to a series of issues, but it's still exciting enough for me to be entertained. Just not as much as I was expecting.There are some minor issues that bothered me a little, like the constant advertising to go-pros or even the slow first act (in a movie like this, we just want it to get to the shark attack instantly), but never at an annoying level. The thing that really messed up the movie and brought its excitement way down was the conflicting tones throughout it. The background music that was chosen to support certain scenes were incredibly off. There are some really serious, tense and emotional scenes with more intense music, but the director was never able to maintain that level of thrill and intensity. That's, by far, my major problem with this film.There's one other issue that, if I have to describe it in one word, it has to be ""stupid"". Without spoiling anything, there's this question that keeps being asked throughout the whole film, again and again, in order to create something that can draw us more close to the story and be more captivated ... And then, it just forgets it. It literally drops it and the movie ends without answering that question, leaving me frustrated instead of relieved or ... ""complete"". I think you know what I'm talking about.Still, The Shallows is an entertaining movie ... to watch at home. It's one of those movies to watch on holidays with some friends and family when there's nothing decent on TV. Blake Lively is amazing and there are some great exciting scenes, even if they're brought down by some not-that-good directing.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",The Shallows
122,catpantry,"Ouch, it was not good",2,17 July 2016,"Is it a science fiction film? If only they would screen some of my favorite movies from the sci-fi channel; they're so much better because at least they're versatile, and they probably don't cost a dime to make. The overuse of predictable, boring, nerve bothering suspense; it was only that. A real life shark is bent on killing people like a serial killer! The shark patrols the area like a human antagonist in a horror movie looking to kill anything that enters the water when we would naturally expect it to, which creates one predictable bloody scene, and then more and more. I felt like I was definitely obligated to give the main character special attention for her staggering effort to stay alive rather than being entertained by it. In this movie a shark stays in one area (Next to stranded Nancy) for a long time and is motivated to take her down and kills others in a very repetitive chain of events way. The film fallows a mind-numbing survival pattern with rest periods between the gory stuff. In a sci-fi movie called 'Attack of the sabretooth' some genetically engineered cats are bulimic and throw up after they eat so they want to keep hunting the humans to eat more which is amusing. In 'The Shallows' a creature is motivated to keep hunting the lead character in a supernatural way, but it's boring supernatural.",The Shallows

The acting was pretty good, the CGI as good as any and it had tension.

The set up with the GoPro footage is very effective, tantalising, a great intro. But then the next scene has some overlayed graphics of the main character flipping through photos on her phone. It's a nice device for a corporate video (in fact I might pinch it), but it's really not cinematic and breaks the tension already built. This is a problem in general, overthought style, slomo surf shots with trance music blasting over the top. It feels like a promo for the beach. The phone overlay stuff is used time and again trying to fill in some back story, but it's incredibly jarring. There's lots of underwater Jaws type shots that thankfully by the 20 minute mark helps build some tension and from here on it does get better. Essentially though it's a B movie with a budget and for all it's plus points, it ruins the good things it has going. A much grittier treatment would've worked wonders. It's a simple story, not particularly original, but a good creative director could've done so much more.",The Shallows

126,dilipbts,The shallows,8,25 July 2020,"The movie is very particular in setting up perimeters and rules. And making it as believable as possible, that in a modern time like this, someone would not be able to call for help (apart from the usual ""no service"" kind of cheat other movies do when it comes to Cell Phones). And if you buy into it, it works.There's also the question why Livelys character goes there in the first place. Well even that is explained, so there is no doubt about motive too. What never is explained though, is not where the Shark came from or why it got there, but how it's possible that it's so bloodthirsty! We're talking Jason Vorhees or any other Slasher movie kind of mad. Maybe even more mad than that.And while you could easily go, well it's a movie, it kind of breaks it's own rules there. Because everything seems logical (explaining mentioned), even the character and her ability to deal with (graphic) wounds ... but not the shark, who is really a monster if you come to think of it.

But overall it's not too bad.The suspense was there pretty quickly and it really does keep you on the edge of your seat, so for that I have to give huge credit. Acting from Blake Lively as well you can't knock in my opinion either.My issues: SPOILERS includedSo my biggest issue was the ending. She attaches herself to a chain and shoots down towards some spikes, shark goes after, she dodged and shark dies. So throughout the film it's shot really well and realistic. But the ending felt so unserious, bit like a b movie rather than a serious film. And it really put me off.I didn't understand why the shark was circling her for days, especially when there was a huge dead whale about 100ft away. It even hits the whale to get her off. I dunno, it was just something that bothered me, because surely this would never happen.If the ending changed though I don't think the above would have really bothered me. At the end of the day, there's only so much you can do about a woman being stuck on a rock in the sea. So I give props for what they made, but the above annoyed me and took it from a 7/10 to a 6/10.

129,harryplinkett14,Insufferable,1,21 May 2017,"I admit, I have not seen the entire film. I stopped when that fat guy swam out of the water, revealing he only had half his body, while the rest apparently fell off while he was crawling on the beach. Of course, we can only guess what happened to him, because the editor or director thought the focal point of that scene was the woman's reaction. How misguided. And how silly to expect a guy who is missing everything below his lungs to be crawling around? This scene was too much for me to swallow, even with all the expectations seriously lowered. It was just painful to watch, like someone constantly hitting you in the face. Don't watch this crap, because the screenplay, the direction, and the editing are abysmally bad. The result is that suspense is minimal, the audience ends up being bored, and ultimately the viewer becomes alienated due to the sheer amount of nonsense one is expected to go along with.",The Shallows
130,PyroSikTh,An Unexpected Hit,8,24 August 2016,"The Shallows doesn't have a whole lot of story to it, unsurprisingly. It's the latest in a line of ""stick a reasonably famous actor in a single situation by themselves and see what they do"" in the likes of Buried and Phone Booth. Nancy's mother has recently passed away after a losing battle with a terminal illness, so Nancy has gone to Mexico in search of a secret beach that her mother went to decades before. Her friend's bailed on her so she's left to go there by herself, where she enjoys the sun, sea, and surf, meets a couple of guys, and then gets bitten by a shark trying to catch one final wave, leaving her stranded on a rock not far from the shore. The next hour is Nancy trying to survive and get to safety with this shark patrolling the waters around her.What the movie lacks in story it makes up for with unpredictability and tension. Of course Nancy eventually survives, but it doesn't look good at times as she's left with a massive gash in her thigh, and this gigantic Great White can obviously swim quicker than she can. Not to mention the distinct lack of food and water around her.It's not exactly a scientifically accurate movie though. Let's be honest, shark attack movies don't work if they're scientifically accurate. I found myself a number of times wondering to myself whether a shark would really act like this. There's a recently deceased whale a few yards away from Nancy, so why is the shark bothered about her and not just gorging it's face on the meal lain before it? The movie also takes place over a couple of days, would a shark really be that bothered for so long? And let's not mention the climax, where suspension of disbelief is absolutely necessary. The Shallows uses this scientific inaccuracy to it's benefit though in giving us a companion for Nancy in the form of Steven Seagull, a wounded seagull also taking refuge on the rock. Steven acts far too much like a dog at times, but I honestly didn't mind because it added some levity to the situation and gave Nancy something to bounce off. I mean it's not like Steven ever talks or anything, it never goes that far, but his presence was definitely welcome and added a nice little dimension to the survival aspect.Blake Lively actually does a satisfactory job as Nancy. I won't sing her absolute praises because it wasn't a great performance by any means, but it was certainly good enough, and probably the best I've seen from her. It's easy to see why she was cast though. She's not exactly the greatest actress in the world, but she's certainly very attractive, and the movie capitalises on that maybe a little too much, giving us close-up shots of her undressing to her bikini and getting ready, and lingering on her boobs maybe a little too long. It just undermined her whole femme fatale angle of self-empowerment and 'hey look, women can fend for themselves'. I wouldn't go so far as to say it ruined it, but it was definitely noticeable.For me though, the biggest surprise of The Shallows was it's visual quality. Going in, I figured this would just look like any other generic Hollywood production, but I was pleasantly surprised by it's simply fantastic cinematography befitting of the industry's top talents. To find it shares the director and cinematographer of Liam Neeson Taken knock-offs Unknown and Non-Stop just surprised me even more. The choice of slow-mo is a bit hit and miss, but I dig it so I didn't mind so much. Case in point there's one of Blake Lively just looking around, her wet hair spinning round her face. Why they felt that needed slow-mo I have no idea. In contrast there was a fantastic slow-mo close-up of Steven that hasn't left me since I saw it.The CGI deserves a mention as well. Of course they couldn't get a real shark in, so it had to be entirely rendered on a computer. If I didn't know better though, I would've thought it was a real shark. Everything from it's skin texture to it's movements is absolutely bang on. I wouldn't say The Shallows is a terrifying movie, but the realism of the shark almost makes it one. The use of the shark is actually quite sparing as well, as it gradually gets revealed to us, and we pretty much only see it as and when Nancy does, so mostly a fin with a large dark shadow beneath. Of course there's a few moments of disbelief, like when it grabs a surfer by jumping out of the water to bite his torso, and the climax doesn't hold back in it's shark presence either, but generally it remains a mysterious monster just lurking out of sight in the water below.I definitely made the right choice last night with which movie I should see as The Shallows was a surprise hit. It kept me on the edge of my seat and looks absolutely great. It also has a great message of female empowerment bubbling beneath the surface, even if it was kind of undone by pandering shots of Blake Lively's body for the male audience members. It's not an accurate representation of shark behaviour, but it's not completely off the mark either, it'll just require you to have a dose of suspension of disbelief to get full enjoyment out of it, which is fine because it's a movie, not a documentary. This isn't an episode of Shark Week. I give The Shallows a thoroughly engaging 8/10, with the visual element being what edges it up.",The Shallows
131,nitzanhavoc,"Excellent acting, unrealistically ineffective shark, good story, fun film.",6,19 October 2018,"When I decided to watch this, I hadn't expected a Horror film (not that The Shallows really fits the genre, but it's close enough). In this regard, I was in for a pleasant surprise, kind of. The protagonist's desperation is very efficiently portrayed, as well as her genuine (and completely justified) fear for her life. The fact that the antagonist is not an evil murderer or a supernatural being of sorts but a terrifying predator did not, in my opinion, make the ordeal less authentic Horror-wise. I believe this film could be enjoyable for anyone who's a fan of similar titles like Anaconda or the classic Jaws.I chose to start off with these statements because most reviews I've seen so far really let The Shallows have it, trashing it like it was a complete waste of time. While I can't help but fully understand their attitude, I don't support it... I personally has a good (if far from great) time watching it and honestly believe anyone not specifically looking for reasons to be completely disappointed - in fact won't be. Why? Here are a few of my personal reasons:1) When I first laid eyes on Blake Lively (protagonist Nancy) I thought ""great, another good for nothing Hollywood eye candy"". I am not too proud to admit it's been long since I've been so wrong. I found her acting is authentic, compelling and absolutely exquisite, taking the entire film to higher levels. You could criticize almost every aspect of The Shallows and I would find it perfectly legitimate (if not always relatable), but not Lively's acting.2) The ocean shots are beautiful. Feels a bit like a cheap cheat meant to distract us from plot holes and other such mistakes, but wow.3) I personally liked the story. All parts seem to connect and it does keep you on edge, even during the less action-packed scenes.Okay, now that I've paid my proper respects, let's talk about the less flattering bits, starting with the shark. Now, I am not a marine biologist or even a devout fan of nature documentaries, but I know enough to know when a predator is ""nerfed"". Quite early in the film Nancy suffers a crippling injury due to a shark bite to her leg, but the wound looks a little more troubling than a paper cut. That's it. This is not a baby piranha, this is a white shark. It doesn't ""miss"" and it doesn't deal flesh wounds. On the off chance that its bite doesn't immediately kill - it dismembers limbs as easily as a knife cuts through jelly. Maintaining suspense of disbelief after such a mockery of trivial knowledge is possible, but extremely challenging, and who would want to make an effort in order to enjoy a movie??? The shark continues to be ridiculously ineffective throughout the rest of the story, to a point of stupidity. While the story is compelling and suspenseful enough to distract you of this fact, there was never, not once, a time when Nancy was out of its range or in any way safe, and yet it doesn't attack. Why? Because we have a movie to shoot, so let's ignore everything we know about sharks...Second, of course, is the almost grotesque bit with a wounded seagull keeping Nancy company (again, let's forget what we know, this time about birds). Without giving away any spolers, I'm not sure if the writers were attempting a wink at Castaway's ""Wilson"", but that's all it felt like... ""She's wounded and stranded, let's add a strange bedfellow"". Nothing short of comic, really not what you want in a movie meant to cause suspense and discomfort.All in all, like I've said, there is a fair amount of good bits making The Shallows a fun and rewarding viewing experience, but only if you're able to ignore the annoyingly unrealistic parts. While I was pleasantly surprised and happy to see the relatively high rating, I can't in good conscience give it more than a 6, most of which is due to Lively's acting and the fact that I did enjoy myself. Lower your expectations - and I believe you'll enjoy yourselves too.",The Shallows
132,romanorum1,The Blonde Surfer Girl and the Shark,5,25 October 2017,"Nancy Adams (Blake Lively), an athletic, likable, and lively blonde girl from Galveston, Texas, travels on a solo surfing vacation to Mexico to escape her studies, even though she only has one year left in medical school. Nancy wants some quiet time to think about whether or not she should quit her studies altogether. Her destination is a remote secret beach that was special to her late mother, who surfed there in her early pregnancy. She later died a cancer victim. While on the water, Nancy makes several acquaintances with two local Mexican surfers, of which one wears a GoPro camera on his helmet. Otherwise the beautiful beach is deserted. While Nancy paddles into shallow water waves, a great white shark (à la ""Jaws"") emerges without warning. It kills a whale, turns on her, and severely gashes her left thigh. Nancy finds a jagged rock, some 200 yards off shore, to escape the shark, and stops the bleeding by using parts of her bikini and surfing shirt. But that rock gets covered at high tide. While awaiting help, Nancy gives medical treatment to a white seagull with a dislocated wing; he keeps her company on the rock. She is hoping someone will come to the beach and calls for help. Instead one drunken dolt robs her backpack and cell phone on the beach and begins to walk off. Then he decides to paddle out to sea, but he is finished off by the shark. Later the two surfers return and try to rescue her, but being unaware of the man-eater, they too are victimized. In the denouement the movie takes a ridiculous turn as our heroine faces the shark in water with dangerous Portuguese Men-of-War and a buoy as her main defense. Hopefully the shark will not try to eat the metal parts of the flotation rigging. Did the embedded object in the shark make it so mean-spirited? Anyway, Nancy will need human help in the end.Jaume Collet-Serra directs a well-photographed and nicely crafted inspirational film about human survival. Nancy has courage and the mental smarts to persevere; she is plucky all right! While Ms. Lively's beauty is impressive, her acting skills are well-developed: she can certainly believably project her pain and anguish. Australian Isabella Nichols acts as Ms. Lively's surf double. But for some, the film may not be enough of a story to get folks excited.",The Shallows
133,CineMuseFilms,take away the thin plot line and mediocre digital effects there is little left other than an attractive woman in a bikini fighting for her life.,5,27 July 2016,"One of the scariest movies ever made, Jaws (1975) made sharks one of the most feared creatures on earth. Its director Stephen Spielberg was inspired by Alfred Hitchcock, the master of terror himself, who understood that what is not seen can be far more terrifying than what is obvious. Like many shark thrillers, The Shallows (2016) continues the tradition of demonising sharks and goes one step further by adding a favourite sub-genre for the male gaze: the bikinied woman in danger. Lest anyone suggest there is misogyny or voyeurism in keeping a woman exposed to a marauding shark for almost an entire film, the story is marketed as a feminist triumph of survival.It is a one-woman show with a simple plot line that spans two days. Medical student Nancy Adams (Blake Lively) travels alone to a tranquil but isolated beach looking for solace while she considers giving up medicine. The photography beautifully captures the tranquillity, the rolling waves, the glistening skin, and the menacing shadow of something big just beneath the surface. She catches a few waves, meets a couple of regular board riders who eventually go home, and she is then stalked aggressively by a massive great white shark. Thanks to med school, she is able to use a fish hook and earring wire to surgically stitch up a gaping thigh wound that was the shark's entre, all while bonding with a lonely seagull in her existential struggle for survival. With no help possible, she must out-manoeuvre the beast or be served up for dinner only a hundred metres from the beach.Digital effects have revolutionised movies and when done well they make the impossible seem real. But when not done well, it is hard to take a movie seriously. This great white shark resembles a blow-up toy and its repeated munching on the steel buoy defies even animal logic. The predictability of the story is forgivable; after all, you do not see a movie like this without sensing how it will end, but the repetitiveness of the attacks is wearying. Back to misogyny and voyeurism: when you take away the thin plot line and mediocre digital effects there is little left other than an attractive woman in a bikini fighting for her life. The real hero of the film, however, is the triumphant designer of Nancy's bikini: whatever mauling she endures the bikini stays in place. The title of the film describes its content perfectly.",The Shallows

Nancy surf's second time, she went back to surf she was attacked buy shark got dragged down she swims to rock stay's there she try's to ask for help. but another 2 characters who were surfer's went in next day to help they got attacked then she has to survive find the way to kill shark and swimming next to rock. you have another survivor bird called Sully 'Steven' Seagull' what ever they named. but thank god shark didn't ate bird, the performance in shallows of Blake Lively is so strong and powerful in movie she is brave as character i really liked her not because pretty but more Blake Lively delivers a strong performance in the role of Nancy and sells the agony & desperation of her character with precision. of character how brave she is thinking of doing something that is gonna risk her life doing something that she could die from but she had no choice counting time before shark when it comes she has to swims to next rock in movie there is a lot of that delivers a tense, gripping, stress.i think it's best creature feature in ages! last shark film was bait i was never fan of that movie i thought eh. the film just filmed in only one location and It's barely 90 minutes long Its only purpose is to give you a thrill-ride during that time; an adrenaline rush based on an ubiquitous fear among humans: being stranded in the ocean with a shark. However as the title suggests, this doesn't take place in the middle of the ocean. Blake Lively character is stranded only a couple hundred yards from the shore, close enough to potentially shout for help. but it didn't come at all For the majority of the film Lively is terrified and fighting for survival against a deadly shark. This thing is huge, like the Jaws' shark's father huge. with great CGI because these days B-Class crap films like sharknado are just 3 year old kids made that CGI with no brain to know how to make a better shark movie. gorgeous sweeping shots of the open ocean, the slow build up before the initial attack, showing the shark only when it's most effective. great location of beach as well it's was shot in isolated beach in Mexico but film began in New South Wales, Australia then it was in Isolated beach in Mexico and amazing thing is BlakeLively ended up performing several of her own stunts, including a scene where her character breaks her nose. In reality, Lively really did hurt herself in that scene and the blood on her nose is real. wow not even actors in B-Class movies could not do that at all. amazing in movie they did that expect for stunts they all that with $17 million dollar budget movie. did great in box office I Would Highly Recommend Really for people who Loves Jaws or Shark Movies or Survival movie besides slow pacing movie Open Water or Reef this is highly recommended movie 10.10 outstanding performance and intense keeps on watching it",The Shallows

136,stevenrotherforth,Blake Lively in a Bikini! Apparently there's a shark in it too.,8,1 July 2016,"The Shallows (4K HDR)The best shark movie since Jaws?
A bold claim but then again think about it, there hasn't been that many great ones since Jaws to be honest.
The Shallows is a good movie in its own right with Blake Lively proving to be as talented as she is beautiful. She really is this movies main asset. The sight of her in a bikini is worth the admission price alone. Was there a shark in this movie? I never noticed.
Creepy jokes aside. This is a well made film.The premise is a simple one, Blake all alone against a Great White Shark.
Whilst there is a small supporting cast it is Lively that has all the screen time and she captivates the audience with a believable performance.
No bikini babes in distress here. Lively's character is smart, inventive and incredibly brave.
The simple plot is as follows. Blake's character is visiting a secret beach told to her by her now deceased mother. She decides to do a spot of finding ones self and a bit of surfing only to find ones self on the menu of a large Great white shark .
After being attacked, Nancy (Blake Lively) takes shelter on a solitary rock with the beach just 200 yards from reach. There is no way she can get there without been gobbled up, and so the tension mounts.
Director Jaume Collet-Serra does a good job at keeping the audience on the edge of their seat and the lead actress is very convincing at conveying her peril. It Just so happens that Nancy is a medical student and is able to deal with her injuries, which is good news otherwise the movie would've been half as long.
Woman goes surfing! Woman gets bitten by a shark! Woman bleeds to death...The end!The movie is beautifully shot and looks absolutely stunning in 4K HDR.
The scenery is gorgeous and I'm not just talking about Miss Lively. (Sorry I'm being a creepy perv again). Crystal clear waters and panoramic views of beach paradise is what I meant.
There's some wonderful shots too in this movie. A particular scene where Nancy is surfing and the shadow of the shark can be seen in the waves behind her. This is rather terrifying just like in Jaws where we only catch glimpses of the nasty fish before the full reveal at the end. Cinematography is good too a specific scene with jellyfish merits this and utilises the use of High Dynamic Range.
I haven't personally checked the Tech specs but I imagine that this movie was digitally shot.
There isn't an ounce of film grain in any frame.
This is a movie to show off that new UHD HDR TV that you have just splashed out on.
This movie is 4K crisp. Detail is marvellous with skin and clothing texture very prominent.
The lush surroundings pop with colour and sharpness.
Visual effects are impressive too. The CGI shark is one of the best in modern films.
With a $17 million budget you can see where the money has gone. The upcoming ""Meg"" movie has an estimated $150 million budget so the giant shark in that better be damn good.As with most films of this genre they get more ridiculous as the film progresses resulting in an absolute stupid finale that nearly spoils all the good work both Director and lead actress have accomplished up until the climax.
I'll not give the ending away but it is so ludicrous it could have been lifted straight out of
'Jaws 4: The Revenge'.
That movie for me being the worst thing ever put on film.
The climatic ending is the only negative I can really find with 'The Shallows'.
Sure the whole story and probability that the shark would stick around just to eat her when there is a juicy whale carcass yards away may be unrealistic. As is the notion that the beast would still be hungry after chowing down on two surfers, a drunk and copious amounts of whale blubber. Forget all that, sit back and enjoy.
I think this could have been a worthy sequel to Jaws unlike the shower of sh*te we actually got.
Just one more thing, Ryan Reynolds you are a lucky man!",The Shallows
137,socrates99,Enjoyed this more than my wife can appreciate,8,22 October 2016,"I can't help feeling we guys should thank Ryan Reynolds for being generous enough to let us guys spend 90 minutes with his beautiful wife, Blake Lively. I've always felt a strong attraction to her though she's not really a perfect 10. I've never really fully understood why she moves me, if it matters, but this film helps explain this weakness of mine a great deal. Something about this California born girl convinces you she's worked out the life problems most people are still struggling with. She exudes independence and courage in a way I haven't seen many accomplish elsewhere.This movie is basically a survival story done on a tropical beach with a brave young woman doing battle with a huge, relentless shark. Many of the shots are baffling and uncomfortably convincing. I've no idea how they were done, but Blake Lively herself is the most important part of this film and she's wonderful in it.Kudos to the director and his talented crew who apparently must all be perfectionists. The result is impressive and memorable.",The Shallows
138,LloydBayer,"Decent at best, The Shallows might just stand out in a summer crowded with unremarkable films.",5,11 August 2016,"'So close yet so far' might be an apt irony to describe The Shallows, a B-movie horror-thriller that just manages to stay afloat. Just about, because the setup is quite ridiculous to begin with, yet visually arresting when required. It doesn't help either that the story is a no-brainer where almost every situation is force-fed via exposition. It gets to a point where the main character Nancy (bikini clad Blake Lively) says exactly what she is about to do, to let us know exactly what is about to happen. And we do.The situation has Nancy - a surfer babe on holiday at a Mexican beach – stalked by a great white shark. The shark is both psychotic and very, very hungry. Amongst the many ironies in this film, the most obvious is the fact that she is just two hundred yards from shore. That's a short distance for her athletic abilities but also the death zone and probably where the film gets its title. Between the shark and the shore, Nancy finds herself stranded on a rock with time running out before the tide comes in. We know this because every ticking minute is flashed on screen thanks to her Casio Baby-G. Her watch, her knowledge as a medical student and memories of her mother fighting cancer sets the stage for what turns out to be survival against all odds.If this was a Spielberg film someone would have suggested a bigger boat, instead director Jaume Collet-Serra is content with staging all the action and terror in limited space and without lavish visual effects. Having previously directed that little 2009 thriller Orphan, Collect-Serra isn't new to the horror genre and it shows. There are some gorgeous underwater scenes, a lot of blood, tense moments of suspense leading to jump scares, and even a joke about a wounded seagull, but is that enough? Call it a fluke, and however middling The Shallows might seem at times, it could still prove a tad bit better than the horde of unremarkable films this summer. And like the title says, there isn't much depth but watching lively Lively is worth the time it takes to sink your teeth into this one; or the shark - whichever bites first.",The Shallows
139,dcarsonhagy,Pretty Shallow,3,30 September 2016,"The movie ""The Shallows"" really didn't have a whole lot going for it. After all, how can you top ""Jaws""? A young woman decides to surf a secluded part of a Mexican beach in memory of her (yawn) deceased mother. She has turned her back on her family (bigger yawn) because she's, what? Bored? This is just one of many problems I had with the movie. It simply did not know what it wanted to be. If you want to put someone in peril, that's fine. If you want to make people believe she is being pursued by a killer white shark, that's also fine. But why oh why do you have to weigh the movie down with this hackneyed, worn out, overused story line? The total absurdity of this movie also did not help. The viewers are told at the start about the affects of the tide. Trouble is, the tide doesn't seem to follow the moon's patterns, as the level of water never changes the entire movie. That is as far as I'll go on the ""plot""--don't want to give too much away.Rated PG-13 for bloody images and some language. I say pass on this one.",The Shallows
140,ericrnolan,"A very short review of ""The Shallows"" (2016)",8,8 July 2016,"""The Shallows"" (2016) is a pretty good beach-themed horror thriller — it's just overrated. I'd give it an 8 out of 10, and I'd easily recommend it to somebody looking for a decent, conventional scary movie. But I don't think it lives up to the hype.The movie works. The scares are there and, for the most part, they are stylishly and artistically rendered. I jumped a couple of times. My friends keep comparing it with ""Jaws"" (1975) or ""Deep Blue Sea"" (1999), but it really has more in common with the ""Open Water"" films of the early 2000's. It's a competently made, slow- burn horror movie with a man-vs.-nature plot setup that could happen in real life.But I doubt that ""The Shallows"" truly belongs on anyone's must-see list, and I don't plan on watching it twice. The story is a little thin. The movie feels padded with lengthy establishing shots and surfing sequences, and a belabored emotional backstory that feels tacked on. (I think this easily could have been an hour-long film.) The final action sequence is a little cartoonish, too. (C'mon.)I'm also perplexed by critics' praise for lead actress Blake Lively's performance. To me, it seemed really poor. (The exception is her reaction shots — she shined when she was reacting to offscreen threats.)Anyway, do check it out.",The Shallows
141,James_De_Bello,6.5/10,6,6 September 2016,"Nancy (Blake Lively) is about to arrive at the beach where her mother was when she first discovered she was pregnant with her. It is a completely deserted beach, deep into nature where only a couple of surfers can be found. Nancy suits up to surf and goes in to surf only to find the carcass of a whale in the middle of the sea and to realize that a shark is lurking nearby.""The Shallows"" is a fine modern update on the shark film, it has many remarkable feats in how it manages to build tension and not be immediately compared to ""Jaws"". Unfortunately a lack of technical smoothness and an underdeveloped story-line keep it from being the otherwise masterful thriller it could have been.The film opens with a prologue sequence which in fact is a flash forward. I was confused if this was the right choice or not when I first saw it, I guess the fact that it proved to be distracting during the film further down the line proves that it wasn't really worth having it, especially because it sets-up what we already know and gives us an anticipation of the end which isn't exactly smart or tricky, it just kind of spoils the film in a subtle way.We are then introduced to Nancy as she is being brought by a local to the beach. This is where a lot, and I mean it, a lot of character set up is delivered and it is indicative both of many of the film's problems and positives. Collet-Serra manages to really direct a great scene and take away the best he can from a screenplay that on the other hand has some great intentions and ideas, but had a very hard time in delivering them and with its resolution ends up making the whole story fall flat and feel like it was shoehorned in.There are two other scenes after that, early in the film, where we get to be presented with our main character's life and conflict. Once again we get touched by some incredible visual flare injected by the director who not only makes the best out of this location, shooting both from angles where we really feel in the character's space, both with incredible wide shots that have a real style to them and manage to really touch your sensibility. Unfortunately, the screenplay simply isn't keeping up with its ideas and, whilst being admittedly very difficult both for director and writer to set up a situation here where to establish a conflict deeper into the character, we aren't given a dynamic that feels convincing enough, which is further proved weak in its ending. Still, what we get from this is a true and sincere attachment to Nancy, who is, despite the heavy handed writing, a very good character whom the audience easily grows to care for.""The Shallows"" also has another element that is deeply ambiguous: the editing. On the bright side we have a film that is flawless in its geography and imaginative in the building of tension. There are some incredibly simple editing techniques used here, but they are used to immense effect and had me sweating my hands repeatedly. On the other side this film cheats way too many times. At the start I was forgiving of this, because I can't even imagine what a nightmare it has to be to shoot this kind of film. Yet, as we went on the film kept cheating, sometimes even deliberately to make dynamics of the story work, and it started to make for a very disjointed experience, which despite having me sweat in suspense almost constantly, it proved to be very annoying.On a positive note I have to emphasize how great the cinematography is, both in beauty of the image, no matter if the widest of shots or the closets of inserts, and in visual storytelling. There are a couple of techniques used to build anxiety which really felt original and managed to terrify me at the same time. Moreover, Blake Lively is by all means a great lead in the film, her performance is genuine and always believable and, with the help of amazing work from the make-up department, she proves to be fantastic, bad-ass protagonist.Jaume Collet-Serra continues to prove he is a gifted and inventive director with an eye for suspense and character focused storytelling. He had me thrilled and I wish I could have thoroughly enjoyed the experience this film could have been with just some more budget for a rewrite and better continuity.",The Shallows
142,coreyjdenford,Shark Tale,8,11 August 2016,"This is my review of The Shallows (spoiler free)**** (4/5)Cast: Blake Lively, Oscar Jaenada, Brett Cullen, Sully 'Steven' SeagullPlot: A mere 200 yards from shore, surfer Nancy (Blake Lively) is attacked by a great white shark, with her short journey to safety becoming the ultimate contest of wills and survival.In 1975 Steven Spielberg introduced us to the first ever shark movie by the name of Jaws and over the past 41 years sharks have been taking over cinema, whether they're really disappointing or very good. This however is not disappointing and it has the same premise as Jaws because it is a woman vs. the Great White, king of all sharks. Blake Lively plays Nancy, a charismatic medical student from Galveston, Texas which is her best performance since The Town (2010), unfortunately she doesn't have a southern accent just the same as Boyhood (2014) when the family were from Texas but didn't have the accent.Nancy is on holiday in Tijuana, Mexico and she is just surrounded by a gorgeous beach and handsome men surfing, like Point Break (1991). However she is then met by an angry shark and has to swim to shore but unfortunately the shark is too fast so she goes to the next best thing, rotting whale flesh. The slow-motion during the surfing is very off-putting but unlike movies like the Transformers series and 300, it only has little bits of it which can be forgiven. The tension is a lot like Jaws and also has almost music but I could be wrong there. Nancy has the same survival instinct as James Franco in 127 Hours (2010) but instead it isn't man vs. really big rock its woman vs. really angry shark as said before. During her survival she has the most unlikely companion in the shape of a seagull with dislocated wing she conveniently names him 'Steven Seagull', at which you feel sorry for both the protagonist and the seagull because Nancy can't swim away otherwise she'll get chased, and the seagull can't fly away because of the wing. A good thing is that when she is isolated she not only thinks about ways to kill the shark but she also uses soliloquies to encourage her will to survive and that really adds a lot of tension to the film. Even though this movie is PG-13 (in America) it has a hell of a lot of blood and many jumpy moments. In its incredibly short run time it has plenty of tension, drama and well, shark related violence.This is a very rare treat because it is an enjoyable ride and isn't really disappointing like many other shark movies, and unlike those movies this has a plot, granted it's very short but it is very gripping. Before we get to Nancy against the shark we see a load of drama between characters like between Nancy and her family through face time, granted, but the drama is there. Unfortunately she also repeats the line ""come back"" from Titanic (1997). Her survival instincts are very strong because even though she gets battle scarred along the way her survival instincts are still very strong, also when the story gets to it's seat gripping part near the end, you feel like you are really there with her which shows just how long humans would last against a really annoyed shark. It is beautifully made and definitely Jaume Collet-Serra's best feature since well...ever! He really doesn't make many good films apart from Non-Stop (2014), but this will be remembered as his best movie. What more can you want? Well apart from a bloody great shark coming at your face.Apart from the really gorgeous landscape it also features a very beautiful woman in tight surfing gear so what more could a guy want? However there are loads of responses saying that this is just a popcorn flick, well no it isn't because unlike popcorn flicks this actually is very good, massively enjoyable and just immensely gripping. Definitely better than many other shark movies out there especially the Sharknado series! Well apart from Jaws that is! This could even be enjoyable with persistent watches which is a very good way to watch this film because at every moment you are at the edge of your seat. Especially when you hear the music 'oh god a shark is coming' you will be especially gripped you won't be able to let go for the whole run time. This is definitely one of the best movies to watch this year. Filled with suspense and memorable a film that is an absolute delight.Verdict: An enjoyable tale of woman vs. shark with a Jaws-like feel. A story of surfing and survival a very rare treat and definitely a lot more fun than the Sharknado series. Gripping and memorable. 9/10 fun and enjoyable just don't get eaten.",The Shallows

Another problem I noticed: the Tide doesn't come in the first night our heroine is stranded on the rock. And what DID happen to the body on the beach...?

There. I'm back. Now, on with the review...So in term's of Lively's actual performance in the film, she is really pretty damn good, particularly in light of the fact that her stages here are primarily a surf board, a rock and a buoy. As regards the story, have you ever seen ""Jaws""? Remember the young chick who gets shredded and taken under by The Great White at the start of the movie? Okay, cool, because that is ostensibly the plight of Ms. Lively in ""The Shallows"". Except that she's not nude, she's not drunk and she proves herself to be one helluva resourceful and resilient bad ass babe. Lively's character, Mia, tirelessly and ferociously fights for her life against a relentless giant shark who has made his pursuit of the fetching lass personal.The action is suitably captivating, the photography both above and below the surface of the sea is first-rate (though you get the feeling that the remarkable underwater sequences may have been shot on a soundstage) and you will undoubtedly squirm and shudder at several points along the way from the direly disconcerting activity being depicted on screen.Overall, that's not a bad recipe for respectable cinematic entertainment now is it? But if not, and speaking directly to the (hopelessly one-track mind) guys out there now, what is so bad, after all, about beholding a perfectly fit and tan Blake Lively in a bikini?

She chooses unreliable friends and turns down the kindness of strangers. Thus, she lies in a text to her travel companion that she'll be staying out late with a ""cute guy"" she'd just met, and she impulsively rejects an offer for a ride back to town after her water fun. Suspense builds as we realize that no one will miss Nancy if she runs into trouble -- and that she does, in the form of a relentlessly prowling shark.Ms. Lively does OK in a role that involves being alone most of the time.
Some of her only speaking is to an injured sea gull -- scenes that come off as trite -- and hoarse but futile shouts toward shore when fellow hapless humans venture into the water.I think this movie does a decent job of conjuring the indifference of nature.
However, its channeling of ""Jaws"" is derivative and cartoonish. In the end, ""The Shallows"" is a weak entry in the genre of nature-horror flicks including the far-stronger ""Blair Witch Project,"" ""Backcountry,"" and ""Open Water"" series.",The Shallows

Like a blend between 127 Hours (based on a true story) and Jaws (based on a book and real events). While preparing for her role, Blake Lively read and learned a lot about sharks and their/our environment. The director of the International Shark Attack File at the Florida Museum of Natural History, George H. Burgess, linked increased shark attacks to the fact that rising temperatures force sharks to move closer to shores in an attempt to find comfortable water and food. Resulting in more attacks in shallow waters than in the deep ocean. Simple, realistic, terrifying and based on true events 'The Shallows' is the Best 'Shark Movie' since 'Jaws' (1975).",The Shallows

150,themadmovieman,"Far-fetched, but still a tense and enjoyable thriller",7,10 August 2016,"As far as shark movies go, The Shallows is definitely one of the better ones (although its competition isn't the strongest). As a pure thriller, the film works well in creating tension and suspense on multiple occasions, even with a few good jumpscares, whilst Blake Lively impresses in a very tough and physical role. However, its story is often extremely far-fetched, and means that the overall film comes across in a sillier fashion than it should do.However, let's start with what I liked most about this film. On the whole, director Jaume Collet-Serra does a very good job here. Throughout, there's a lot of good suspense that keeps the film moving fast, and on one or two occasions instils a little bit of fear too. Playing off of classic Jaws-like sequences, The Shallows makes the shark an undoubtedly menacing presence, and although it's not as terrifying as possible, I always felt that it was a genuine and strong enough threat to Blake Lively's character throughout.Also, Collet-Serra manages to direct the environment pretty well. The rock on which Blake Lively finds herself stranded for so long does feel claustrophobic, and the shark is always a looming presence, keeping the tension high throughout.It's a well-directed movie, apart from one detail that kept popping up and frustrating me as I watched. The location of the rocks within the bay isn't always consistent. At times, it does indeed feel just a short 200 yards away from the shore, and tantalisingly close for Blake Lively to escape, but at others, the rocks are visually more isolated and distant from the objects around them.I'd like to believe that this was done deliberately, to create a greater sense of isolation and peril, but the fact that I could clearly see that the rocks weren't always in the same place really bugged me throughout, and contributed to the film's rather far- fetched nature (which I'll get onto in a moment).Blake Lively also impresses here. Her character may not be given the most thrilling arc, nor did I ever feel much emotion as to whether she ultimately lives or dies, but when it comes to some extremely physical sequences, whether she's battling with the shark or escaping away, she does a great job, and makes the fight with the CGI sea creature fully convincing.I was surprised that there was so much to like about this movie, because I expected something far dumber. The only part of the film that lived up to that expectation was the story. It's by no means bad, and the tension of the premise kept me engaged throughout, but there are definitely moments where the film wants you to empathise a lot more with the main character, even though the screenplay just isn't effective enough to bring that across.What's more is that the final act of the film is, for lack of a better word, stupid. Again, I was engrossed enough by the tension that I still enjoyed watching, but the way in which the film draws to a close, and the way that the shark and Blake Lively finish their duel is frankly insane, and had me laughing my head off (along with several other people in the screening).Overall, however, The Shallows was a big surprise. Shark movies are generally terrible, and I had low expectations for this, so I was delighted to end up with a tense, entertaining, well-directed and well-acted thriller. It may sometimes stray beyond the bounds of logic, but it's an engaging watch throughout.",The Shallows
151,teddyryan,Lifetime Network makes a shark movie.,3,12 July 2016,"THE SHALLOWS is not hindered by its script. Or by its star, Blake Lively. It is hindered by the poor execution of its director - Jaume Collet-Serra. The story of a young woman struggling against a vicious shark is ripe with possibility. Not to mention, Collet-Serra need only look to the great predecessor of the genre, JAWS, for direction. Unfortunately, Collet-Serra falters with the rules of basic filmmaking, editing, and shot composition. These directorial botches render the presentation of The Shallows as stale, motionless, dull, and downright irritating. As far as main character's backstory and motivations, Collet-Serra takes moments of poignant potential and clumsily portrays them like a Lifetime Network movie. **SPOILERS**The generic presentation of Blake Lively as a sex symbol is God awful. As she preps to hit the water on her surfboard, there's a B-grade montage of her sexy surf bod. This includes close- ups of her cleavage, behind, and spicy hot bikini - accompanied by a 2002 WB inspired soundtrack. It's too bad Collet-Serra (and his producers, who I assume are to blame for this lethally banal onslaught) couldn't abide by the less is more principle. Even the reveal of that James Bond heroine (wearing a bikini and holding a coconut) in Dr. No seemed graceful compared to The Shallows.As I mentioned before, The Shallows is an editorial mess. At one point, there's a standard shot of the hero bobbing on top of the water, the audience frightened what lies below us. But, then there's a random cut to an overhead helicopter shot, which suddenly pulls us out of the moment - which I think is trying to show us the shark's massive domain - although the character is stuck on a tiny reef - a couple hundred feet from shore.As for the shark itself - it's an embarrassing 3D composite that looks more like a cross between Cloverfield and a 747 jet. As I was watching Lively fighting for survival against this War of the Worlds beast that happens to have a fin - one that gobbles a fellow surfer like Godzilla - I thanked the Gods of filmmaking that decimated Spielberg's mechanical shark and forced him to rely on the basic elements of suspense to create a masterpiece in JAWS. Please note, I'm not some snobby, pretentious film purist, or the type of person that would actually utter the words, ""I could make a better movie for that."" Not sure I could. However, I think there's a time and place for visual FX. I think visual FX can be extremely useful. However, in the case of The Shallows, we're displaying a shark - a creature that is scary enough as it is! If the VFX house that worked on The Shallows lost all the composite footage, the film would have been blessed. If you're looking for a good shark flick (else than JAWS), I highly recommend OPEN WATER. It's 3000 times more captivating, frightening, and bone tingling than The Shallows - probably because the filmmaker employed actual sharks and gracefully handled a taut, thrilling script. If you want to see how you handle one character versus nature, go back and view CAST AWAY.Ted's Grade: D plus.",The Shallows
152,shobanchittuprolu,"The Shallows is a masterpiece in the genre after a long time and a must watch with nail biting screenplay,stunning visuals and powerful Lively.",9,12 April 2017,"The Shallows (2016): In the time where even 2 headed and 3 headed sharks are introduced in films,who would expect a masterpiece in killer shark genre.But The Shallows proved us wrong and remains as a cult classic in the genre after Jaws.While every B budget maker is making sharks attack using tornadoes,Jaume Collet-Serra cleverly made a laughable genre into a thrilling ride with medium budget and best output.Plot:A medical student, Nancy (Blake Lively), takes some time off from her studies and heads to a secluded beach in Mexico to surf. While surfing she is attacked by a large shark, leaving her injured and stranded on a rock not too far out to sea. What follows is a battle of wits and wills between her and the shark.Plus Points:1)Screenplay and Direction: The Shallows starts as an ordinary shark film beginning where a girl goes to a beach and starts surfing.Nothing happens at that time except stunning VFX and cinematography but once Nancy finds carcass of whale,things take a surprise turn and then begins a thrilling ride which last for another 70 mins.Jaume Collet Serra wrote a taut screenplay with nail biting scenes.After a long time ,we are finally afraid of sharks instead of laughing at them.The film takes Olympic-level pleasure in watching her swimming, leaping, fighting, scrambling, enduring – ensure every attack and counterattack convulses and grips.Climax is awesome and really deserves applause for the scene with jellyfish.2)Cinematography: Flavio Labiano-I don't know this guy but now I am a huge fan of him.Entire shots of ocean and surfing are beautifully shot and I have ever seen an ocean so lovely and deadly at the same time.Even the little coral reef where Nancy gets stranded is amazingly shot by clearly showing the suffocating area.Underwater shots are plausible.3)VFX: At first the VFX of tides looked average but once the action began,entire VFX rose up to high level.There is a shot where Nancy surfs over a big wave and a sharks lurks behind the wave.That shot is one of the best scariest idea of all time.Shark looked real and the cuttings,blood look is shocking.Climax scene with jellyfishes is awesome and visually stunning.4)Sound design: Sound design is spine-bucklingly vivid,especially when Lively suddenly gets ragged into water her breathing sound is captured splendidly well.5)Blake Lively: Last but not least,Blake Lively carries and keeps the horror survival thriller afloat and captivating by vigorously selling just how dire and terrifying her situation is, while still remaining strong, composed and compassionate.Her perfect body in bikini may be a eye feast at beginning but once the shark attacks,we can only see her struggle.So,The Shallows is a masterpiece in the genre after a long time and a must watch with nail biting screenplay,stunning visuals and powerful Lively.My rating 8.5/10",The Shallows
153,leesimon-26357,"In the realm of shark movies, this is closer to the top",8,7 February 2021,"This film is shot extremely well, and gorgeous to watch. Lively acts very well, and the other ""bit"" players do a fairly average job. Overall, the idea is nothing new, but the ways that the main character navigates her situation are original and suspenseful. The thrills are good, it looks good. But for 2 major deviations in animal behavior, this film was very good. So with those 2 blips in the plot that we must accept to keep the movie going, this film scores an 8.

The movie is simple, intense, scary, emotional and it goes straight forward into the main thing. The shark looked extremely original and alive, especially when it was moving and opening her mouth with all those teeth. The only thing I am not very fond of is the pace, the scenery is pretty blank because you are seeing the same thing, same scene for an hour, but in the end it gets more interesting.",The Shallows
155,TheRedDeath30,Perfectly Mediocre,5,1 October 2016,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I follow a lot of horror site and writers on social media and had seen a lot of really positive reviews about this movie. Further drawing my interest was that I, like a lot of people, am fascinated by sharks and always waiting for the next great shark movie.What this movie most definitely is not is the next great shark movie. It doesn't come close to matching any of the glowing reviews that presented it as a tight, tense thriller. I will absolutely, though, say that it is also not nearly as bad a movie as some of these one-star ratings would have you believe. Truth is, in my opinion, this is completely mediocre. It's the sort of movie that fills 90 minutes, has a few entertaining moments and goes away, completely forgotten in a decade.I think that we all need to avoid the trap of saying that this is (or is not) the next JAWS. That is such an unfair comparison to make of any movie. JAWS is one of the best horror films ever created and to expect any movie to come close to it is not a fair comparison. With that said, I will say that what works so well about JAWS is not really the shark itself anyways. Those lessons are what movies like this fail to realize. The director here does, wisely, pick up some lessons from Spielberg's masterpiece. The movie works better if less is seen of the shark than more. Very few shark effects hold up under tight scrutiny so too many shark movies make the horrid mistake of overplaying their shark, creating laughable moments. I thought that this movie does a good job of keeping its' shark unseen for a majority of the run time, a creature we know is there but can't get a good glimpse of, just like the character. When it does, finally, start to dominate a little more screen time, I think it holds up pretty well. I have seen reviews bashing the effects and I'm not sure what they really expect. Name me one shark movie that looks better, truthfully and honestly. It's not easy to do and I think this movie does a fair job.My wife said this movie is like CASTAWAY meets JAWS and that's very true. So much of this movie is focused on the tension, rather than the terror. We spend a lot of time on a rock with a surfer girl and a seagull. While it keeps the movie from becoming SyFy Channel garbage with too much bad effects shark, it also puts all of the weight of the movie on Blake Lively (who is no Tom Hanks). It's not that she's ever bad or has one of those amateur acting moments that make the viewer wince at a bad line or facial expression. She just doesn't have the presence to carry the movie the way that the screenplay needed. Just about the time that I was getting frustrated with nothing happening, though, the director wisely starts amping up the action and the last act is pretty good. Yes, there are some moments that make you roll your eyes a little, but there are faaaaar worse shark movies out there.Kudos to the director, also, for not going for the cheap death that too many other horror directors would have gone for to ""shock the viewer"". I'm not getting more specific than that, but there was ""someone"" I was clearly cheering for who makes it.",The Shallows
156,FallenEye,"Sea, Gull and Gal.",6,28 April 2018,"A large part of me really and truly does resent that this movie got me to care about a seagull, a freakin' seagull! Then, to add insult to injury, that damn seagull was actually in the credits, and its nickname actually is Steven. It was part of the cast! It got a paycheck and everything!!! I mean, when it was trying to wake her up when those two surfers returned, and when it bit Nancy's finger... I swear, Steven won me over.And then that shark, what the hell was its problem? No, it was not the hook in its mouth. That shark had a grudge. Had it not died, I would've preferred this film issue a warrant of a arrest, for 3 counts of premeditated homicide, grievous bodily harm, attempted murder and hell, conspiracy to commit, between it and its maker.The Shallows was thoroughly enjoyable, and Blake's gracefulesque kind of sexiness made it that much easier to experience. The D.O.P was pretty stunning, the tension buildup was on beat and Blake's performance was good, but not her best. The whole shark constantly attacking plot line needed more meat to sink its teeth into however. This film turned a seagull into a dog and a shark into an irrational, deranged human with a loaded gun trying to rob a bank without an exit plan. Also, the manner in which that shark met its end felt a little too, kind of, a tad bit leaning towards, iffy. 6/10.P.S. Anna is a terrible friend though, apparently and evidently, who hopefully got crabs since poor Nancy had to chew on one.",The Shallows

Very little story, and the little there is is just cheesy rubbish thrown in to try and make us care about the main character.But essentially this movie is just a girl in a bikini trying to escape a shark for an hour and a half. it's keeps your interest a bit because she's not completely stupid, unfortunately the storyline , as it unfolds, is. The shark is done badly, it looks awful and the way it looks and acts and what it's capable of it just laughable, which is a shame and unexpected as the rest of the movie is done pretty well and the acting is OK. In my Opinion the movies saved by the main girl not being too much of an idiot, and (last act excluded) doesn't make many decisions you think are stupid like in many other movies.",The Shallows

Both characters are doing what they need to do to survive.There are those who will say that the shark would have feasted on the whale corpse and ignored the people. There are those who will observe that a shark really doesn't go on a killing spree. In the movie's defense, you have to have something to keep the film interesting and build tension for the film to work well.Blake Lively is wonderful and brings a lot of life and character to the film. She makes you root for her - which brings more tension into the project. The film did a nice job showing her ""logically"" figure out ways to help herself survive. That was a huge bonus. It was a very well written script that gave you a believable situation.The shark looked great. The movie kept the shark at a minimum (ala Jaws) which was a smart thing to do. Keeping the film focused on Lively's character was the best way to tell this particular story.I had low expectations going into this film because of the history of bad shark movies that have polluted the industry, but I was rewarded with a great survival film that I would highly recommend.",The Shallows

Alita meets a young man Hugo (Keean Johnson), but soon learns her new world is a dangerous one. She discovers clues to her past fighting the corruption of those who run the City, Iron City. Above iron City is Zalem a city in the sky. Hugo tells Alita that is where he wants to go. You might say it's like a Heaven where life for everyone is good. That's what we are told. Nova (Edward Norton) who says he sees everything runs Zalem. Hmmm................

You have to give this a chance as it is a very good, heartwarming story as well as many Cyborg battles, which show excellent CGI and spot on editing. Remember this is more than 300 years in the future and things have changed from what we knew back in 2019. See? Yes, I did say ""heartwarming. "" You'll see. Dr Ido is very protective of Alita and tries to convince Alita that she has been given a second chance at life and to just enjoy it for now. Of course, Alita cannot buy into this and wants to fight when necessary; and Alita finds a kind of love with Hugo. See?Alita discovers that she is a warrior and doesn't shy away from hand to hand combat. Guns are not allowed In Iron City. And Alita has a fondness for the game of RollerBall where many Cyborgs compete. Am glad this did not turn into a Rollerball movie. Alita joins the Hunter Warrior Society. Hunter Warriors are basically Bounty Hunters and only go after their Marks for money.Notables: Jennifer Connelly as Dr. Chiren, Dr. Ido's ex wife and who is a partner in the Rollerball games run by Vector (Mahershala Ali), and who also promises people to send them to Zalem for money or to do a job and both Dr. Chiren and Vector work for Nova, who for the purposes of this story, may be considered a god and we only see him at the end and has given Dr. Chiren and Vector orders to kill Alita; Jackie Earle Haley as Grewiska, a tremendously large Cyborg who meets Alita early on and has orders from Vector to kill Alita; Ed Skrein as Zapan, a Hunter Warrior, who is constantly a nemesis to Alita, and Hugo later on.Note: James Cameron was a producer on this and had screenplay writing input.This is very enjoyable and fast paced too. Rosa Salazar is perfect in the role of Alita and we really enjoyed Christoph Waltz as the very protective Dr. Ido.

161,lorcan-61881,The best shark film since Jaws(1975)!!,8,10 December 2016,"The Shallows is a shark thriller drama film starring Blake Lively. The film tells the story of a young girl who goes surfing on a island after her mother died of cancer. Soon after,she discovers the true terror floating under them very waves;a man eating shark hungry for her. I was very interested in this film when it came out but i was more interested in lights out as it came out the same date and i never saw it until now. I rented the film on Sky Store hoping for a good film well let me tell ya I was very pleased with this film. The film was very colorful especially at the end which i really liked,it was so cool and..cool!!Blake Lively did a very well job as this girl stuck on a rock with a huge shark surrounding it.

162,PetarNeo,Very strong Lively performance.,7,29 August 2016,"Blake made probably her best performance with this role as she plays victim of shark attack. You can feel her pain and agony as she fights for her life while at the same time trying to stay as sane as possible. Movie on the other hand is a little slow at the beginning but then after some time it shows us real deal and why we came for the movie. Shark is frightening at some moments but at other you don't feel such thing as it seems more and more predictable. Some scenes can feel unreal as shark seems so violent and determined to get to her at any cost even when he need to go through steel. Surfing scenes were nicely done and slow motion at certain points is very well used but there is probably too much of slow motion scenes. Worst part of whole movie was drunk guy. First of all what was he doing on a beach that only some people are able to find, second when he listen Blake as she pointed him to bag but didn't listen to her when she said to get out of water he must be some greedy guy that has nothing else to do then rob people. Shallows is maybe Blake's way to more serious roles and it offers strong performance but lacks connection with main character and more scenes that are going to keep audience tense and in expectation of terrifying moments. 2.5/4",The Shallows

The Shallows got Blake Lively who I don't see much of aside from that horrendous Green Lantern movie that was in like 2011. She plays a woman who goes on a retreat to the beach where her mother was when she was just in her belly. After her mother died she decided to go. She gets bitten by a shark and has to fight to survive. This is one good looking movie, and I don't mean like Blake is good looking but just to put out their I think I see the appeal. But the cinematography from the opening to the sunny beach and the shots of her on the rock from overview is really mesmerizing. The story is told in a good narrative structure and the pacing is really good, the movie went by quick and got to the good stuff quick. I don't see much of her but Blake Lively is really great in her performance and a lot of times I was on the edge of my seat and you want her to make it out but you just don't know what is going happen.

The unreal part of this is the only part that gives it the horror aspect (the psycho shark, lol). Otherwise, it's more like a 'thriller/suspense' movie, IMHO. This movie, in a way, reminded me a small bit of the 'Soul Surfer' movie without the relentless shark coming back for more like in the movie 'Jaws'. 'Soul Surfer' was a one-time shark bite, but it was based on a real story and a fight to return to surfing. It had way more of a plot and it wasn't horror. Still, this movie had a decent premise for a horror genre. It's a B- rated flick, done somewhat well. Geez, don't be so hard on it. If you want to watch something to put you on the edge of your seat a bit or some nail-biting anticipations, then give this a shot. Otherwise, don't waste your time. Formulate your own opinions.

But the hook in the sharks mouth eludes to its hatred of humans. Hence it stalks her!",The Shallows
168,MF210,"As shark films go, this one is pretty good",8,26 June 2016,"When I saw a preview of the Shallows, I got excited because there really has not been a quality horror/thriller film involving a shark in quite some time. I really enjoyed Open Water, despite its poor dialogue and mixed quality acting, but its been over a decade since that film came out. For most of its 90 minute running time, I can say that the Shallows is an intense man(or woman in this case) versus nature film and proves that Hollywood can still make a quality shark film.When watching a shark film it's impossible not to think of Jaws, but I was surprised that Cast Away was the next film to come to mind when watching the Shallows. Blake Lively's character, Nancy, like Tom Hank's in Cast Away, is stranded on an ""island"" (really a rock) with no human contact. Like Cast Away, Nancy is given a companion of sorts, an injured sea gull. The relationship is shorter in this film than Tom Hank's relationship with the volleyball but it is nice touch and provides a little bit of humor in an otherwise humorless film. The character also learns to be self-reliant and overcome great obstacles to survive. This makes the Shallows fundamentally different from Jaws and makes the film unique in its own right.One of the best things about the Shallows and what makes it so intense is the use of a timer. It reminds us that Nancy is battling so many obstacles to survive and she only has a limited of time before the tide comes in and her little ""island"" will be underwater, and she'll have nowhere to hide from the shark. Her dilemma is being injured and going against an animal that can swim faster than a healthy person. Personally, I found it clever how she was able to get from the ""island"" to the bell buoy.Unfortunately, my praise for the film ends when Nancy gets to the bell buoy. The last 10 minutes of the Shallows are the perfect example of a screenwriter who has written a good script but can't figure out how to end it. The screenwriter obviously wanted to end the film with Nancy surviving and killing the shark, but had no idea how to do it. So we get a ridiculous ending that is reminiscent of the Jaws sequels, particularly Jaws: The Revenge. The Shallows bordered on being a very good film with me, but because of this insane ending it's merely a good film.Nevertheless, the ending doesn't damper the fact that this is still a well-made little thriller. The cinematography is gorgeous, especially the overhead shots of the beautifully clear water. Blake Lively's performance is the rock that holds the film together, she makes Nancy into a credible, resilient character who uses all her knowledge and resources to survive. I've always found Lively to be a beautiful woman but I have never seen anything where I found her to be a good actress. The Shallows changes that, if Lively's performance wasn't as convincing I don't think the Shallows works as well as it did.Overall, I would recommend the Shallows as well-made summer thriller that will at least make you a little cautious when entering the ocean this summer. It's not on the level of Jaws as far as shark films go and I was disappointed with how it ended, but it's still well worth watching for the thrills it provides and for Lively's performance.",The Shallows

Jaws on the other hand, even though it is 40 years older has physicality.. you feel there is something in the water not just some cgi fish. The music in Jaws also helps a great deal to sell the illusion whereas the music in this movie is completely unmemorable The one thing that did look really good was the bite wound and although the way she was dealing with it was a bit ridiculous, the blood spurts did make me feel queasy. But in terms of shark attacks the audience sees nothing basically Overall there are too many unintentionally funny moments.. the seagull, the psychedelic jellyfish sequence, and the way the shark attacks the bouy and dies at the endThe acting is also not the best, especially the bit where she records a short video for her family in case she dies.. so bad I can't recommend this movie except as mindless entertainment",The Shallows

This 86 minutes long film makes you witness the survival thriller of a female getting trapped in the sea. Attacked by a shark and injured severely, and many challenges in front of her, be it high tide, and stranded there with no one for her rescue, how she survives and fights back and saves herself in spite of not even knowing the name of the beach forms the story. It is indeed a treat to watch Blake Lively essaying the role of the protagonist. Although, we have witnessed such types of survival thrillers in the past, some inspired from real life incidents and some fictional. The themes and situations might have been different and intensity also might have varied, be it The Edge, The Grey, 127 hours, Alive, Frozen, Gravity, The snow walker, Rescue Dawn, The Revenant, Sanctum etc. We have seen our very own Suraj Sharma giving excellent performance in Life of Pi. The Shallows is not very intense like previously mentioned films, but it would keep you hooked on to the screen. The Shallows captures the life-or-death experience of the protagonist, pitted against seemingly insurmountable odds, her efforts to find the feasible resources to survive against an implacable enemy – shark.The film begins with a young boy playing with a soccer ball in a beach. He finds an action camera attached to a helmet, he gets astonished to see the video of a man struggling to come out of water but ultimately getting killed by a shark.Frames move further to tell us the story behind the video captured in the action camera. A medical student Nancy Adams (Blake Lively) travels to an isolated beach in Mexico to surf. She wanted to go there, since her mother (who is no more) had surfed there many years ago and this is where she had discovered that she was pregnant with Nancy. Carlos (Oscar Jaenada), a local guy, drives her down to the beach. Carlos refuses to divulge the name of the beach to Nancy in spite of her frequently asking him. He just says that it is a paradise. Once Nancy reaches there, she just loves the beach and gets ready to surf. She finds two men also surfing. After a quick break and video chat with her sister Chloe (Sedona Legge) and father (Brett Cullen), she dives back to surf. While heading back to the shore, a shark hits her surf board, making her fall. As she tries to get back on the surfing board, the shark bites her leg very badly. Then begins her fight for survival. How does she handle her injuries? What resources she use to stop the bleeding from her leg? Who comes for her rescue ? How does she handle the high tide ? What all challenges come in front of Nancy ? Surfing scenes are breathtaking. Also, certain fights which Nancy puts up for her survival will keep you glued to the screen. Blake Lively as the protagonist has indeed given a great performance.'The Shallows' captures the life-or-death experience of the protagonist Nancy Adams portrayed by Blake Lively, pitted against seemingly insurmountable odds, her efforts to find the feasible resources to survive against an implacable enemy – shark.

174,lnvicta,"Nifty, well-crafted shark thriller boasting a strong lead performance by Blake Lively.",6,4 July 2016,"The Shallows knows exactly what it is, and that's the best praise I can give it. It's barely 90 minutes long, has a small cast, and only one location. Its only purpose is to give you a thrill-ride during that time; an adrenaline rush based on an ubiquitous fear among humans: being stranded in the ocean with a shark. However as the title suggests, this doesn't take place in the middle of the ocean. This woman is stranded only a couple hundred yards from the shore, close enough to potentially shout for help. What The Shallows does so well is establish this sense of isolation and hopelessness for our main character, and her situation of being so close yet so far from safety.Blake Lively is great in this role. It's mostly a reactionary role - not much dialogue aside from some early establishing conversations to develop her character. For the majority of the film Lively is terrified and fighting for survival against a deadly shark. This thing is huge, like the Jaws' shark's father huge. And it's interesting to see how she follows its patterns and observes its behavior, allowing her to act accordingly without being trapped. There are some far-fetched scenes, sure, but Jaws had them as well and it's hailed as a classic. Now I'm not saying The Shallows is as good a movie as Jaws, because it certainly isn't. But again, the movie knows what it is, and as a short shark thriller appealing solely to our primal fear, it gets the job done and then some.Now, it has its faults. The electronic music during the surfing scenes was immediately off-putting, and there are some slo-mo shots that definitely did not deserve to be in slo-mo. But the directing as a whole is well done - gorgeous sweeping shots of the open ocean, the slow build up before the initial attack, showing the shark only when it's most effective. The writing is clever and practical, relatable to the point that you feel for this character's predicament, and the acting as I said is top notch. The Shallows doesn't break any new ground, but it does exactly what it sets out to do - give the audience yet another reason to avoid the beach.",The Shallows
175,howboutthisone_huh,maybe there are two versions of this movie,8,24 November 2016,"Because the movie I saw in the theater and on DVD recently is very good. The scenery and photography is stunning and blake lively is very nice eye candy too. There's not much to the plot and granted the beginning and the backstory seem like unnecessary filler but how is the movie predictable? I wasn't expecting game of thrones. I wasn't expecting the shark to tear her to pieces half thru the movie. I kind of expected and hoped she would get out of the situation but predictable? C'mon. Not realistic? Well, no, I don't think a hot girl alone on a secluded beach is very realistic but I hear stories of such things all the time. I've seen my share of survivor movies and it doesn't really have that gritty realistic experience you'd expect for someone going thru what she does but for me the photography, story, and pacing made up for that. I don't understand what people were expecting. The cgi is quite good. If this movie had been made say 15 years ago it probably would have gotten much better reviews and box office. She shares a rock with a bird? Well, so what? For that moment the two are in pretty bad straits and just going thru the same experience. It's not all that unrealistic and constant mayhem for an hour and a half only makes for a 'b' movie. The shark looks fake? I wasn't impressed but then I'm not a sharkologist. The only sharks I've seen were in an aquarium. I wasn't impressed but it look real enough to me and they don't just throw the shark into the pool; there's some lead up to the story. I particularly liked how the shark silloette appears in the wave but I wouldn't call this predictable. All in all it's a fun movie to watch. Not too many really good shark movies have been made since 'jaws'. This one is well directed, interesting story, great photography and a hot woman.",The Shallows

First of all, the Cinematography combined with great Camera Work makes for one beautiful and visually stunning movie. The drone and underwater shots are simply gorgeous.Second, the story is actually pretty good, with nice background on the motivation of Blake Lively's character to go that place and the dynamics between her and her family members. Next is that the thrills and twists are really pretty good, and there's quite a number of them.Blake Lively herself gave a fantastic performance of a Medical Student trying to survive a Shark Attack. All these factors result in a great, highly entertaining movie. I know it did quite well in the Box Office, but I felt that it should've done much better owing to the quality the movie.

She keeps asking those she meets what is the name of this beach. No one tells her. She encounters a great white shark and finds herself marooned on a little rock island protruding from the water and has to deal with the tides coming in and going out.and, oh yes, the great white shark circling about.You wonder if this was a true story. It's not. But you come to believe this is totally believable. In a disparate move after a lengthy stay on the rock, she manages to get to a buoy about 30- yards away. Okay, I didn't know there is a flare gun on some buoys. Who knew? I don't want to mislead you: the flare gun doesn't save her. It just ticks the great white shark off even more. Oh, oh. Now more tension. I got to thinking why no one would tell Nancy the name of the beach. I think that was because the rock in the water she stayed on doesn't exist and that was pure CGI for the story. See? But that doesn't take anything away from this well made story. The photography is simply stunning and quite unbelievable throughout. The choreography stunts are amazing too. Kudos to both. You will be riveted. You will think of the movie JAWS and wonder if this will be as good. It is very good. The tension never stops. Never. There are a few scenes where I had to turn away after the shark attacks from time to time. (Me too) Again you think of JAWS and hope she makes it out of there.

As a private citizen he gets involved in another case where a woman is blown up in a car, but is also wants to kill Driscoll (John Finn) who betrayed him and his partner during that failed bust. The word Bent is meant to mean a dirty cop and it is used a lot during the movie. Danny Gallagher was never Bent. See? This was the first time I ever heard ""Bent"" from any movie. Most of the movie is taken up with solving Jennifer's (Cherish Gaines) murder who was blown up in the car in the beginning of the movie. Danny is helping her brother find out what exactly happened. We learn that all this has to do with a money laundering scheme and a government conspiracy that the FBI is keeping tabs on via Agent Rebecca (Sofia Vergara).Now do we care about any of this? Of course not. We have seen this story a million times. Was it good? No, mostly because we didn't care about anything in the movie. Sofia Vergara needs to stick to comedy because she was quite wooden in here. What we could have cared about was that Danny would find a way to clear himself of accidently killing that undercover police officer and getting back into the good graces of the police department. This never happened. Danny claims he was framed for that killing. So Danny is focused on killing Driscoll who killed Danny's partner, and who gets out of prison soon. Notables: Andy Garcia as Jimmy, Danny's mentor; Grace Byers as Kate, Danny's love interest; Tonya Cornelisse as Helen, Danny's one night stand; Bill Pacheco as Pierce, husband of Jennifer and he watched her being blown up in that car.

180,freshclean-66-318608,Don't Expect Much.,5,31 December 2016,"""The Shallows"" was pretty much what I expected it to be, a film that has great visual effects but at the same time poorly written, subpar, and that can be in no way, shape or form be compared to ""Jaws"". I wasn't expecting much with this film. I knew it was going to be a film that was, for the most part, eye candy for most of its viewers with Blake Lively playing the lead role as Nancy. With that being said, Blake Lively did put up a fairly decent performance in this somewhat below average film and the action was O.K. With the right writers and directors I think this could have been a stellar piece of work. I've seen films that took place in one localized spot that had me at the edge of my seat and all it took was the right story to be written for it and a great direction. This film could have easily been that. Also, there were some parts of this film that had me with some questions, but I guess that's to be expected for this kind of film. So if you want to see a pretty girl who fights off a shark with some decent action and not be too concerned about how the story is written and not be concerned about how deep the plot goes then this will be right up your alley.",The Shallows

The story follows Blake Lively (who gives her best performance) coming to an island to deal with the death of her mother. She decides to go surfing and then she realizes she's not alone and that there's a shark who will stop at nothing to eat her up, She has just become the victim and the food of this shark. Now stranded on a rock and deciding how to escape it makes you wander how she will make it out of this alive.Blake Lively is just downright awesome in this role. Forget Gossip Girl, think is ""acting girl!"" The CGI effects of the shark are also really well done. You never knew when the shark was going to make his attack. The cinematography was also well done. The way the surfing and shark scenes were shot were brilliant. The direction was excellent also.We....The Autistic Reviewers (Jay and Nick) give this movie 4.5/5 stars. 9/10. It's so close to beating Jaws. It maybe another 40 years before we see another shark movie this good again. Go to the cinema and enjoy it! -Autistic Reviewers.",The Shallows

183,iamtherobotman,Creature Featureless,3,30 June 2016,"OK, so i'd imagine this will be Billed as 'Jaws for the 21st Century' and to an extent i can understand why. However back in the Early/Mid 70's not a hell of a lot was widely known about Shark behaviour and as a result many had an irrational fear of these big Fish, so along came Jaws which played on and to a great extent intensified those fears and a Horror classic was born. Sadly for this Film, the public now have access to as much information as they can digest, much more is now known about Wildlife and their behaviour and so the irrational fear which was present in the 70's is now replaced with a certain respect for Sharks and someone failed to inform the makers. Shortly after the Shark attack - within 5 minutes - i'd given up caring what happened to this Woman. I was hoping the Shark was going to finish her off quickly and end this poor attempt at a suspense/thriller/horror.",The Shallows
184,Genti23,Really good summer flick,9,18 September 2016,"The Shallows is a survival thriller film directed by Jaume Collet-Serra and stars Blake Lively in the lead as Nancy Adams. The film follows Nancy, a surfer who gets stranded away from the shore and attacked by a great white shark. This is a really well made thriller that brings the whole shark attack back on the big screen roaring. I liked it a lot, and Blake Lively does a fantastic job on the role, especially considering that she is pretty much the only actress on the entire film. I also really liked the CGI shark, that looked really threatening and real, the cinematography by Flavio Labiano is really good to look at too. It does get a bit too get going until the shark attack, but overall this movie is really well made and the director Jaume Collet-Serra keeps on making really entertaining thrillers over and over again. This one is no exception either because it has all the thrills and nail-biting scenes that make this a good summer fun flick.",The Shallows
185,SivakumarBalachandran,Solid Shark attack survival tale,7,14 August 2016,"My take on The Shallows (English) 2016: Survival flicks have always been my favorite. So thought recap some of my favorite survival flicks before actually reviewing the current one ""Black Water"" ""Frozen (2010)"" ""127 Hours"" ""Burning Bright"" ( I am taking ""Cast away"" "" Life of Pi"" "" Gravity"" in this list because of it higher production values). The Shallows is a solid survival flick which falls in line with the above mentioned movies. With that genre introduction let's see what the movie has to offer. Lone survival – animal attack – Thriller- Secluded place- touring/expedition gone wrong and off-course shark attack are some of the key words that can best describe this movie. Blake lively as Nancy goes on a relaxing holiday to a secluded beach and enjoys her freedom surfing where she encounters a shark attack and whether she was able to win the shark and get to the shore safely is the next 1 hour 25 mins movie in front of you. With the whole weight of the movie on her shoulder Blake Lively has given a solid performance in terms of her expressions, screams and courageous attempts acts. On the technical side the cinematography was so vivid showcasing the beauty of the beach in terms of its depth and color which actually sets the ambiance for the movie. VFX works were commendable. The best part of the movie the thrill element was kept intact ie the shark itself by not showcasing it every now and then ,we see it surface few times with a terror unexpected entry. Screen play and direction has went hand in hand. The climax was a bit soggy. Otherwise it was a worth watch. Highly recommended for those crazy Survival thriller lovers out there. I would rate it 7 on 10.Sivakumar Balachandran",The Shallows
186,Sci-FiHorrorFan,Wow This Film was brilliant!.,10,22 November 2016,"This film blew me away it was Brutal Exciting and intense!.The main actress Blake Lively did a fantastic job acting wise and her character was very likable and cute.I found her to be a funny and interesting character and she was also a fighter which is another thing I liked about her. This film was so good I could talk about it all day.The Film was shot in a beautiful location and the scenery was fantastic!. I am a big fan of nature and to see such a beautiful location filled with ocean and greenery was a real pleasure. The film was very well directed and written.I also thought the film was shot very well. The main actress Blake goes surfing one day and a shark knocks her off her board, she gets wounded and ends up having to swim to a Rock in the ocean to take cover there since the shore is too far away.The shark starts circling her so she has to stay on the rock and think of a way to escape and get back to the shore.I am Very surprised some people don't like this film.What is there not to like?, Its very thrilling, its very engaging! its very entertaining! The scenery is brilliant, the music is brilliant,the film is Brutal and intense!. This film has so many good points! And I can't think of a single bad point!. In my opinion this film does everything right.And having a strong and likable Girl as our lead character helps a lot. The story may not be original but no film is original now a days so what does that matter?. The Film is Very entertaining! And to me that's what's important not nitpicks about originality. I thought This Film was Just as Good as Jaws.I personally like the music in this film more than the music in jaws to be honest. The music in jaws was okay but it was more suspenseful music where as the music in the shallows was more intense and gripping.you could really feel the urgency in the music which made the film feel more intense.This film has an okay score on IMDb But it deserves much higher in my opinion.This is one of the best survival Thrillers I've Ever seen! And it deserves a 7.0 Rating at the very least if not higher. What makes this film work so well is The suspense and thrills.This film just has a way of sucking you in and you feel as if your in the film because the danger that is portrayed is very realistic.I also thought Blake Lively was very believable as a fighter and someone who was determined to survive no matter what.Her character was NO Pushover that's for sure!. She put up a Very good fight against the Shark! She even Shoots a flare Gun at the shark at one point and wounds it really badly.When I saw that scene I was like Hell Yeah! Do it again!.All the Action scenes with the Shark were very Thrilling and I enjoyed every one of those scenes. There is also a good amount of emotion in the film between the girl and her dad when they talk on the phone.The talk they had at the start of the film gave you a good idea of what her character was like and what she enjoys doing. There was even a scene where the girl is stranded out on the rocks in the ocean and she finds a bird there that has had its wing Twisted and I thought it was nice when she tried to help the bird.she could see that it couldn't fly away because its wing was Hurt so she did a nice thing and she helped it get away by putting it on the surf board and the current slowly carried the bird to shore. Most people would probably laugh at that, but I Liked that scene because it made you see what a good person the girl was. She was a very good character and I liked her a lot,I also though she had great survival skills.she was stranded out there all by herself on a Rock and she still found a way to survive.She was also very brave by fighting the shark, and how she took it down at the end was Very BadAss and it made me cheer for her.Blake's Performance was Great and she played a good part.Overall This is a Great film And I Highly Recommend it!.",The Shallows

188,WatchedAllMovies,A dumb shark movie,4,10 October 2016,"As if asking for trouble, a woman goes surfing all by herself. Then she encounters a shark that is hell bend on eating her no matter what.The majority of the movie shows how she move from one island or floating object to another. If they add another ten islands, they could extend the movie by two hours. Truth is there is not enough plot to cover even one hour. I have to keep skipping forward while watching this.In the final scene of the shark, it stopped moving and get all wrinkled up. It's as if the animatronics is damaged but they decided to continue shooting with it.Considering it has so many past shark movies for reference, it is surprising this movie did not come up with something more exciting.Some people actually paid to see this in a theater?

You already know you're in trouble when the filler drags out this long.And then the plot holes and implausibilities start kicking in like the recent Alien films. Her watch tells her the tide will be low in 'x' amount of hours, but the tide never goes out; and she stitches her wounds with pieces of jewellery; and getting a couple of well-timed kicks onto the shark's nose; and befriending a seabird that's also a survivor of shark attacks (no doubt); and scrambling up onto the back of a floating whale as if that's even possible.... and more and more parts of an implausible film that was 75% boring tripe. The only person of note in this film is Blake Lively, and she survived her rendezvous with the shark thingy on the rocks, and managed to get back to her normal life in Texas, that's it..So many rigged reviews on this site, it's quite unacceptable really, with comments like 'best shark film EVA' like that's a compliment or something, considering that shark films are pretty dreadful anyway, and 'a really good summer blockbuster', like that makes it OK then because it's the holidays and no-one really cares in a dizzy sort of way.Lame film with a seriously zero plot, and suspect positive reviews.

(Ryan Reynolds you are one lucky guy) For the get go you get a brief camera footage which come apparent later on in the film, thing seem so calm & beautiful on Mexico beach until the this film main story kicks in it because a serious film. Woman vs nature for survival & omg god does Blake lively pull this off with a convincing role as Texan medical student Nancy who trip turn's in to a nightmare when she heavy stalked by a 25 foot great white out blood.This is where this film turn into intense moment with brutal & shocking scene of death that make jaws ashamed ,iam not kidding this film manages to keep that concept of peril like there is no hope of survival through out the film which bring you to tears because you don't know if she gonna survive or die at any moment which is good for the film because it keep you grip to the screen just wait for the next scene to happen. Blake lively performance is perfect she show perfect survival instincts being alone trap on a small rock the tides coming in she has over 200 meter to the shoreline with a shark that can swim faster, she pull this off perfect with charisma, vulnerability, and resourcefulness that is ideal character concept for a heroine of this genre of film. With a bold and plucky attitude that seems to say, ""gimme your best shot."" as riveting to the points watching her scramble to stay alive, determined not to lose to what appears to be the very hand of Fate itself.This is how you make a shark film, kept the casting to a minim, cast a brilliant act or actress that can keep the concept going through the whole film just like this film you have the making of an outstanding shark movie that seriously made jaws less frighting & step up the food chain intensiveness & frighting moments that will truly make you fear the water again.This film seriously does this, its not only intense, bloody, foreboding & thought provoking it seriously put the fear of the water back in the audience like jaws once did, i highly recommend watching this film as you wont be disappointed as there is a references to jaws.",The Shallows

Budget $17-25M; box office $119M.Sharks in real life never behave the way they do in the movies - this is the lesson I just suddenly realized.I have always been fascinated by great white sharks and have always liked Hollywood movies about them. However, after watching this movie and doing research about real shark behavior, I came to the sudden realization that maybe I should not watch shark movies any longer since sharks in real life NEVER behave the way they behave ALL the shark movies.""6 Shark Attack Myths from 'The Shallows'"". I just read that article about this movie on National Geographic; it is a good read. Everything I thought I knew about sharks has been dispelled by that article.Incessant stalking and ""terminator""-like haunting behavior - this is pretty much seen in ALL shark movies including this one, Jaws 1-3, Deep Blue Sea 1 & 2, 47 Meters Down 2017 & 2019, The Reef, Una Noche (2012), which are all movies I have seen and can attest to this. This is in ALL shark movies and yet turns out this is a myth. Even the smelling of blood from a long distance is also a myth.This film did not take into account REAL shark behavior just like all the other science-fiction shark films and even threw out the window the diving decompression science.The outcome of the shark in this film was also very science-fiction.
The plot's introduction was very poorly written. Later we find out why she is at the beach, but that should have been mentioned at the introduction.And yes, the ""big dead fish"" was also not smart for the plot.On a positive note, I did like the camera angles. I also really liked the slow-motion approach to some of the scenes.""Bird set free"" by Sia - this was a nice ending song.However, despite the film's total abandonment for REALITY and SCIENCE, overall it was a cool movie. it had nice beach clips, nice cinematography, and the CGI was fine.

Has its heart-stopping moments, not least the one right into the third or fourth minute of it. Phew!Isn't without its flaws of course (such as, where did that drunk man's dead body disappear suddenly that the two guys who came back the next day could see it for themselves the danger attached with jumping into the water?), but the ending, the death of the villainous shark, is such a masterpiece that you easily forget the rest of the stuff.Despite all the praise and admiration, it doesn't go down as a 10 out of 10 film, not the kind of film where I would be saying that it was a never forgettable experience, or a once-in-a-lifetime one. It definitely was good, but somehow not up to some of the other experiences I've had in the cinema in the past. Maybe it was too short in length (87 minutes) and the thrill was too short-lived? Maybe. Although it's a well documented fact in my past reviews that I really dislike films too long in length, but since this was a film full of thrills and those heart-stopping moments and doesn't fall into the same category as many other films. But this is not a criticism of the film. There's not too much you can do with a shark in water.So, again, a good film overall and the performance by Blake Lively was pretty impressive.

The scene was pretty exciting when Nancy fought the ferocious shark and the last scene so shocking ....,The Shallows
195,RMurray847,"Tense, taut and lots of fun. A real summer surprise!",7,11 January 2021,"Let's not kid ourselves, Blake Lively is not a great actress. She will NEVER be a great actress. But if you need a young, blonde, all-American, physically fit actress, Blake Lively will fit the bill. She exudes health and vitality. It's easy to believe that she would be up to tough physical tasks. She's friendly and expressive.So she has found perhaps the perfect role for her talents with the gripping THE SHALLOWS. She's called upon to play an American surfer who has come to an obscure beach in Mexico do enjoy the very waters her mother remembered so fondly. She chats amiably with her driver, then arrives at beach. She is filmed somewhat lingeringly getting changed into her surfing gear, and then she has some fun with a couple of local surfers. The scenery is gorgeous. The people are gorgeous. It's all wonderfully tranquil. Until, suddenly, it isn't. Lively, late in the day and now all alone, is attacked by a huge shark. The movie is now one of survival, man-against-nature.The film clocks in at a crisp 87 minutes. It tells just enough story, for the most part, and nothing more. Lively's adventures, while certainly quite unlikely, have just enough credibility to draw the viewer in. There are brief moments of humor (the film features a wonderful seagull!), and plenty of moments of terror. If the ending is a bit of stretch (and the coda that follows it a bit ham-fisted), my feeling upon leaving the theater was of having been well and professionally entertained. It's not quite a horror film, nor is it an existential crisis film (like ALL IS LOST, Robert Redford's excellent film). It follows a competent, determined but fearful character that we like as she tries to figure out a way past her deadly dilemma.There are a few flaws, of course. These vary from unavoidable (a few of the CGI effects are not great, no doubt due to the film's tiny budget) to unneeded (sorry, but I just don't buy Lively as doctor-in-training...and the script didn't have to make her one). A few times the shark perhaps acts with more intelligence than it should (despite what JAWS: THE REVENGE suggested 30 years ago...sharks don't carry grudges). And the ending feels a bit tacked-on and unneeded. We've spent nearly the entire film alone with Lively. We should have been able to end it that way too.But these are minor annoyances. If you want some heart-pounding fun, set in a gorgeous location (with some beautiful views from above) and prefer to get your frights without supernatural elements, THE SHALLOWS is highly recommended. This film came somewhat out of nowhere...but it is well worth discovering.",The Shallows
196,jeromesgabilo,DECENT SHARK-SURVIVAL THRILLER,6,20 September 2021,Blake Lively's performance was albeit a good and safe one. The suspense was there as well but I just think the running time was a bit hasty.,The Shallows
197,chas437,Beyond Horrible,1,30 March 2019,"Where to begin? Having to stare at an anorexic/bulimic looking Blake Lively for 90 minutes, is draining considering she's one of Hollywood's worst actresses. Amazingly, that's not even the worst part of this movie.
The plot holes and logical fallacies are overwhelming. For starters, we are told the film takes place in Mexico, but its obvious takes place somewhere in the South Pacific. The opening scene is a jeep driving through a Eucalyptus grove. Then we see a beach with a large coral reef and a Silver Gull. None of these things occur in Mexico. Why? Why not just say it all happened in Australia, the actual filming location? It does nothing to serve the storyline.
How does Blake Lively survive for over 24 hours without water, in the middle of the ocean under a tropical sun? After losing a ton of blood? Not only does she survive, she's able to out swim/dive a Great White Shark.This is yet another mindless Hollywood action flick. Its more ""you go girl"" propaganda. Ultimately, Its really an insult to anyone with any intelligence. I was rooting hard for the shark, or the gull to eat up her scraps.",The Shallows
198,drawlife,One of the very few decent shark films.,8,9 July 2016,"Up until now, of all the shark movies that have graced the silver screen, there are only three that I happen to enjoy(Jaws, Jaws 2, & Deep Blue Sea), one of which happens to be my favorite film of all time, that just so happens to be directed by one of the greatest directors who ever lived(the answer is obvious). After viewing The Shallows, I can safely say I have four shark movies that I enjoy. The film attempts to debunk and transcend the clichéd and tired tropes of previous shark films. Blake Lively portrays a woman named Nancy, and she does a good job with a very difficult role here. There's some context and substance you wouldn't expect in a movie like this. Although I will admit it was kinda slow, but as an audience member, knowing a little about her character held my interest and allowed me to feel enough sympathy to even care just a little bit. Not to mention she has no one to talk to for the most of the film.With a run time of less than 90 minutes, it's fast and brisk once it gets started. It's straight to the point and knows what it wants to be after learning some backstory of Lively's character, and meeting a couple of people who are most definitely shark food. Lively commands the screen and her survival instinct comes in play when she is being stalked by the great white shark. She eloquently conveys panic, fear, but also perseverance throughout, and by the end, there's something to admire about that no quitting attitude. She attempts to be one step ahead of the shark throughout, as she devises numerous of ingenious and risky strategies to prolong her survival time, but no matter what she does, she can't seem to throw the shark off-course. There's also a seagull you come to care for with a dislocated wing, injured by the shark that keeps her company while she is stranded on mini isolated reef island. Incorporating the seagull was a nice touch by the filmmakers. Speaking of filmmakers, I haven't enjoyed any of Jaume Collet-Serra's previous entries as a director. This is the first film within his resume that I happen to enjoy. Filmed in New South Wales, Australia, the film is gorgeous to look at and there are some excellent underwater camera work. He certainly knew to take advantage of the setting. Collet-Serra displays his ability to produce some tension and showcases his effective thriller timing. There are moments where one could expect and anticipate when that shark is about to jump into the frame, but even then it's still an excellent surprise moment. He also takes cues from Spielberg's Jaws, as the shark isn't showcased often, rather just in glimpses, which only makes the shark more frightening. When it is showcased, the cgi is handled with care. The shark looked great. Even after chomping on a few victims, that shark really had a thing for Nancy. In doing so, I got a sense that the shark had a personality of sorts, so another kudos for the filmmakers for incorporating that element. The Shallows isn't a game changer by any means, nor does it do anything entirely new, but it does exactly what it needs to do, and in the end its a shark movie we never knew that we needed. Perfect for summer viewing. 8/10",The Shallows
199,a-twetman,Simple shark movie but a good way to kill some time,7,31 May 2017,"The concept of this movie is incredibly simple: a surfer on a secluded beach gets attacked by a shark and has to survive stranded on a small rock poking out of the water. With a simple concept like that you can't really expect much in terms of dialog, characters or deeper meanings, it's meant to be a way to kill some time and for what it is I think it's well made. By limiting the setting to that one small rock island, just a few hundred meters from the safety of the beach; coupled with plenty of areal shots to show off exactly how small that rock is, hammers home the isolation and exposed position of the main character. Add a shark set on taking revenge on humans and the fact that the main character has been seriously wounded serves to build up tension towards the action sequences. Pacing is good too with some calmer moments to let the audience breathe between action scenes. Sure, some elements of the movie are rather unrealistic but that's fine because they get a reasonable explanation within the movie universe. After seeing various shark related B-movies like Sand Shark or Sharktopus, it's nice to see one where the movie makers have actually put a bit of thought and effort into it. If you have a bit of time on your hands, definitely check this out, it's a good thrill ride.",The Shallows

The shark's killed a humpback whale that's unrealistically still floating and it's not even interested in eating it. It's apparently more interested in surfers. It even gets impatient with Blake Lively sitting on it for awhile and takes the effort to ram into it to knock her off. I mean, if I were a shark: the whale I've just made a rotting carcass out of (the humongous mass of sea flesh) that I can apparently have to myself since there aren't any other sharks around or more work and stalking for humans I shouldn't be interested in the taste of, one of whom is obviously really hard to catch anyway?

201,Bofsensai,"Beautiful location, fun implausibilities 'let's all drink' (water!) shark genre",5,30 July 2017,"Just had to add in this review because of 'tenuous' associations with surfing: So: first, this should get high (tide?!) marks just for the location and stupendous scenery scouted and scooped - (secluded, world heritage national park Lord Howe island = kudos to location manager Duncan Jones as it's ""the heart and soul of the film'"") - and truly, it's gorgeous: especially so in the aerial end credits; plus with some nice, cool surfing shots (sorta like much earlier 'Crystal Voyager'). Pity then that the stunt-woman(women?) - Isabella Nicols as 'Nancy' (Blake Lively's character) as credited, but also a Kelly Richardson as her 'stunt double' - so whomever did all the surfing shots is not more highlighted e.g. in DVD issue, no extra considered worthy on her/them from the makers, in this rather germane aspect to the movie.And so indeed, it is nicely filmed: but otherwise, oh, those scriptwriters (just A. Jaswinski?)! Either testing our credulity (the suspension of disbelief!) to the max or just never taken any study course on plot holes, implausibilities or whatever? They infest this film more than critters would do the huge hulk of the supposedly stranded deceased whale that sets the conceit of this 'tale' all off ..So, IN PLOT SPOILERS WARNING HERE of the suspensions of disbelief you shall need to enjoy this offering, here we go: to that whale then; so such huge creature would be just beyond the surf and not noticed at all? Neither smell, nor blood, nor seagulls gathered around, let lone enormous (female!) shark about it? OK: With such a huge feast available to it, this (female!) killer instinct shark would still prefer to suddenly hunt humans (it's already ominously hinted at in the swell of one wave crest BL surfs - but somehow still never breaches that wave ) OK: That said (female - against female, note= geddit? e.g. á la Aliens?) shark would still be driven to instead prefer feed (prey) upon so surfing fit, lithe (=damn skinny!) prey: OK: Shark so huge (it's female, right = so even huger) that it can not only chomp in half a wading guy, entirely consume two (male) surfers, it's teeth ('jaws') chew away at a metal buoy, BUT, leaves merely a flesh wound, no more than almost scratch on the heroine: OK: A cove that has surfing high waves, but that to the (handy convenient) rock, on which on the whole, the water merely laps at and over: OK: that the tide, a constantly referred to plot device to the film, seems to not rise consistently (believably) - indeed, actually, if almost at all: OK: self first aid stitching with an ostensibly pretty UNsharp 'earring' (or was it necklace) would not put you in some form of bleed out shock: OK: That your wet-suit material is so flimsy, can be ripped (accurately, too) by your very own pearly white teeth - BUT then still have enough tension to make a form of tourniquet, as having previously been your arm piece, but can now 'stretch' over your thigh: OK: Said type of injury would still not impede your determined swim capabilities over several yards (just incidentally constantly trailing blood, whilst the shark blithely circles ...): OK: That in the time stranded on rock - at least two days? - first under cloudless day scorching sun, then associated drop in temperature cold night, still no hint of hypothermia nor dehydration, to that having been in the (salty?) sea, could so survive so feistily with not a drop of fresh water ... OK: That jellyfish not only suddenly turn up in a surfing cove, but in any case localised to (just?) between a rock and a (hard!) buoy place, but that in swimming through, only ONE would sting, and that in any case, is bearable enough to forget about afterwards (I've read that jellyfish stings are so excruciating that even after painkillers those affected can still plead to have the stung area cut off!), and - yes, in any case - when stung, causing you to scream underwater, still does not cause inrush of water to drowning proportions ... OK: that a buoy is in a cove for some reason (yes, I know: it warns of the rocks: right!), so that it has a distress flare gun on it (it's in a cove - within sight of the shore !): OK: that said flares, once wetted, will still function: OK: that in your cleverly arranged despatch of predator shark depends on that you could not only out-swim but out-dive such a streamlined sea creature .. (yes, I know: it involves a momentum weight chain - so darned easy to hang onto !)OK: and .. well, I could go on, but please, go enjoy to spot ya own, as note, no mention of seagull veterinarian skills that would not either kill or cause flight of  (ya just gotta 'see' that one.) All to which make this a super 'drinking' film: have a sip of unsalinated water for every implausibility you spot :-) coz, on the whole, I still found this quite enjoyable - nowhere near trash - although totally unfair on the true nature of sharks, but come on, it's a movie 'tale' ain't it? e.g. initial surfing scenes with great sound design and effects, too.

202,cmovies-99674,THE SHALLOWS was a very interesting film to watch,8,18 August 2017,"PROS: The best part of the movie was the tension. It was electric! You were set up in very basic, very improbable location (with very little recourses) and you were tasked with thinking creatively. That was the fun part. And even though there was so little that could actually take place because of the location, it didn't stop from building up the tension that was inevitably there. Another thing that critics disliked, but I really enjoyed, was the acting. BLAKE LIVELY took a difficult role and made it her own. There was so little room for creative character development, emotionally wise, but she did the best she could which I saw.CONS: The biggest problem I had with this movie was the faults with the conclusion of the film.

After half an hour of some maneuvers of surf in slow motion she is attacked by a shark. Somehow she manages to climb a rock where she's joined by a seagull that has also suffered a blow from the shark. The rest of the film is Nancy on the rocks making improvised band aids and several attempts to call out for help that, very predictably, all turn out fruitless. Towards the end of the film she can swim to a signaling float with the increasingly furious shark acquiring super powers that it can even eat the steel from which the float is made. Nancy is able to escape in such a miraculous and unrealistic way that it can only be seen to be believed - or not!

I thought the phone overlays on screen looked really amateurish and the scenes with her family were beyond cheesy. Most disappointingly of all, the shark which had looked so good to me at 720p, really did not hold up well at 4K (the last 20 mins is still pretty epic though).Basically it's a mediocre film elevated by Blake Lively and some good shark action right at the end (skip the 4K though).",The Shallows

206,MovieWarfare,A pretty enjoyable shark movie with some tone and plot issues,7,13 June 2020,"Jaws was one of the most popular shark movies ever made and no movies after that have quite captured the feel of that movie. A lot of directors try to add their spin to it but it never quite worked like Jaws, not even the sequels to Jaws. The Shallows was a movie that I feel ""almost"" captures it.The movie has a simple premise in that a medical student, Nancy Adams (Blake Lively), who is suffering from the loss of her mother is attacked by a great white shark while surfing and left stranded on a small land of rock. Left injured and stranded 200 yards from shore, Nancy must fight for her life as the deadly predator circles her in its feeding ground.The thing to note is that this movie is a one-woman show. Blake Lively shines as the main lead Nancy and she has to considering the movie is mostly 80 minutes of her fighting a CGI shark. She gives such a powerful and believable performance that shows the struggle her character is going through. Every scream, cries and gasp for the air of Nancy feels very real and this was only successful due to the amazing performance of Blake Lively. There is some supporting cast but they are either shark bait or really just there to give exposition or some backstory to Nancy. One standout supporting cast has got to be the seagull that Nancy befriends named Steven Seagull. A lot of disaster movies has a dog that the audience doesn't want to die and in this case, it's Steven Seagull.I also really enjoy the movie when Nancy was stuck on that rock. It was incredibly tense and very suspenseful. Every time the character has to step off the rock it is honestly some of the most nail gripping and high tension-building moments ever. These moments are slow burners and not high octane intense moments where she is getting attack every couple of minutes but it feels way more entertaining that way. However, during the third act, the movie does become a high octane shark attack movie that becomes borderline ridiculous and kind of silly albeit slightly entertaining.I also really appreciate the one location this movie is set in which is visually stunning and beautiful but made for the film as hell for our character and the audience.While I do like the movie when she is finally on the rock, the build-up from before is such a drag especially considering this movie is only 87 minutes long. The beginning also tries to set up some sort of plot point with Nancy not being sure if she wants to be a doctor anymore due to her mother's death. She asks a lot other supporting characters concerning this but then it is dropped when the shark attack happens and is never referred to again. It just feels like pointless padding and it didn't make me more invested in her character in any way.There are also some weird choices such as the music/score and editing. The beginning and last part of the movie has some really strange music choice with pop songs that honestly made me question if I was watching a 90's music video or something. It ruins the serious nature and creates a conflict of tone within the movie. The score during the shark attacks becomes more of what I expected but not exactly memorable either. There is also a lot of slow-mo in the movie that just feels really out of place and unnecessary. It feels like parts of this movie is a modern take and some feel like it is in the 90s.The CGI shark is generally all right and feels real for the most part. However, during the third act, it becomes notably worse and some non-CGI Sharks are also quite bad to look at and kind of took me out of the film sometimes. There is literally a slow-mo scene where a CGI object is flying towards the screen and it was laughably bad.Overall, despite this movie never really reaching the level of Jaws, it does feel like a relatively competent and entertaining movie. It has a lot of good in it that on first viewing you will definitely come out having a thoroughly enjoyable time with it.",The Shallows
207,shannen-l-c,Arguably one of the best shark movies I've seen,6,17 February 2018,"Despite not being a fan of shark movies (with the exception being 'Jaws', because come on, that's just a classic), I decided to give 'The Shallows' a try. Due to the disaster that most shark movies are, I didn't have very high expectations, but this movie took me by surprise. First of all, kudos to Blake Lively for her fantastic performance as Nancy. It's not easy to give a strong performance when you're stranded on a rock for 3/4 of the movie and it's also not easy when you're holding down an entire movie practically on your own, but Blake pulled it off. Although I've enjoyed her in 'The Age of Adaline' and 'Gossip Girl' in the past, I was pleasantly surprised at how well she did and think she deserves a lot of credit for what she achieved with this movie. The main issue with shark movies is that from the very beginning they're utterly predictable. You see the trailer, the title or the summary and you immediately know that it's going to involve a shark attack, what more is there to it? However, Nancy's resourceful and resilient personality is really what takes this movie to another level. Despite the hopelessness of the situation she was in she fought tooth and nail (excuse the pun) to survive. Every decision she made was practical and logical which made it very easy to root for her and want her to survive. Suspense was built up and the first half of the movie managed to keep my attention, but towards the end it drags unnecessarily and becomes frustrating. As a viewer it's obvious that she's going to survive so I don't see the point in dragging out the impending death of the shark. Despite the slow pace towards the end, the general pace throughout is good. My main issue with the movie is how unrealistic it is. Nancy is stranded on a rock in the middle of the ocean for what appears to be days, with multiple injuries, no food and no water. Being in the burning hot conditions during the day and freezing cold conditions at night, particularly with the blood loss she'd suffered, means it's doubtful she would've made it to the second day. Furthermore, the fact that she had enough energy and strength to repeatedly get into the water and swim and even take on the shark is ridiculous. With no food or water in her system she'd barely be able to stand let alone swim. Despite this, for a shark movie, 'The Shallows' is good. With any shark movie there's very little creative freedom or opportunity to create an intriguing and gripping story, so in that aspect, 'The Shallows' did the best it could with what it had. Blake's performance is definitely what takes this from a 4 star rating up to a 6 as I strongly believe she made this movie what it is.",The Shallows
208,nmholland,The Best Shark Thriller Since Jaws (1975),9,25 June 2016,"The Shallows is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra and is the story of a young girl (college, to be exact) named Nancy, played by Blake Lively, who visits Mexico in order to go to a hidden beach that her mother used to go to. She's a surfer, so she goes for a surf, along with two Spanish men that were in the area. However, when the men leave earlier than expected, a gigantic great white shark attacks her, wounding her leg, and leaving her stranded on a small rock just 200 yards away from shore with no help in sight.After the disappointment that was Independence Day: Resurgence (2016), I wasn't too excited to go back to the theater, but I'm sure glad that I did. I was expected a decent, B rate shark flick with The Shallows, but I got so much more. Almost everything about The Shallows works on tremendous levels, and I was very impressed by the film as a whole. All of the acting was good (even though one of the two characters with the most screen time being a seagull), the direction was amazing, and the special effects were fantastic.Blake Lively does excellent in her role, playing a strong female character (which isn't a common phrase in most films nowadays) with a will to survive. Her conflict with both the shark, and to get the mindset of survival down, was near perfectly displayed through both the script and Lively's acting talent. The viewer really wants this character to win, and roots for her continuously, breathing a sigh of relief each and every time she gets to a temporary safe zone. Her acting was terrific, and I look forward to seeing her in future films.The special effects done on the shark are astounding, Each and every shot that the shark is in looks amazing, showcasing the film's great effects. Since the shot was in one of the trailers, this isn't a spoiler, but the shot in which the shark jumps into the air, grabbing a man in his jaws (no pun intended), and curving back down into the ocean looked absolutely incredible. Many other moments like the one mentioned are in The Shallows, which, alone, make this movie worth seeing.The direction, by Jaume Collet-Serra, is amazing, especially in the underwater shots. This man brought such a high level of suspense to this film with his directing capabilities. Almost every shot is present simply to prepare you for the next, and the next, and so on, until the suspense drops the floor from under you, and lets off the steam that it needed to. The jump scares can get a bit predictable at times, but aren't overused to the point of exhaustion like most ""scary"" movies tend to do with them.My only issue with the film was the exposition. We learn a lot about Nancy through some video chats and messages between her and her family/friends. This gets old after the first five minutes or so, and the restless audience really just wants to see a shark eat somebody. Although that sounds a bit unprofessional, it's completely true. Once the tension starts, and the shark comes into play, learning more about our protagonist no longer seems like a way to lazily establish the character anymore, it just feels like a break from the suspense, which is the exact way scenes like such should be filmed.Before my overall conclusion, I must give props to Steven ""Sully"" Seagull, the seagull who played the seagull. All joking aside, he did very good for a bird.Overall, The Shallows was a very pleasant surprise, and I'm glad that I watched it. I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't have small children with them, because it can get pretty intense at some points in the film.",The Shallows
209,MK_Ultra_,Pump the brakes here folks...,3,22 July 2016,"I'm not sure what is driving these scores, but maybe it truly is the dreaded ""sign of the times"" when it comes to what people want in cinema. With that said, this scored a solid 3/10 for me.How did I come about 3? The director relies too heavily on cliché and tired shark tropes and amatuer hour camera work relying on heavyhanded CGI. The story? Doesn't get much simpler, it's melodramatic back story is loathsome.Welp, the first 30 minutes were actually tolerable. I blame that on the fact that the director hasn't been allowed to use his ""toys"" yet, that, and the fact the shark hasn't even been shown yet. The underlying ""sense of dread"" and tense is done remarkably well, as you know it's there and the surfers casual approach to the water kept you guessing when it would all turn to sh*t. (mainly, for me personally, because I am terrified of deep dark water and/or sharks).You can set a stopwatch to where the wheels fall off. As soon as the slow motion and the poorly done CGI waves start to fade out, the shark comes into play. Not only is the last half of this film an insult to the viewers intelligence, the director (whom I haven't even bothered to address by name...don't know, don't care) shows every level of an amateur who relies to heavily on tricks and gimmicks.When it finally gets down to a ""one on one"" with the shark, it's just plain bad film making.The shark CGI is awful. It is Sharknado 3: Electric Boogaloo worthy. This film also has a running time (if you remove the credits) at about 70-75 minutes. If you feel you got your moneys worth out of this steamer, then we probably have zero commonality in films. Sharknado did not take itself seriously, this film does.Coming in for an edit: go see 'In the Deep' (renamed 47 Meters Down) This film succeeds where this film fails miserably.

210,Schuriken,What !!??,4,1 July 2016,"I only have one thing to say for the opening of this review. Oh my God !!Hollywood just doesn't get it. No matter how many millions of bucks they keep spending, they just can't get a shark movie the correct way. They can't even get the shark right.There's almost no shark in this movie. We see more of a seagull on a rock than a shark. It's supposed to follow the Jaws recipe but it just doesn't get it right. Not showing the shark kinda worked in Jaws because they couldn't get the shark working and had to film it in a different way.I was very worried in the beginning. I saw a lot of smart phone moron type of characters but it went away after a while. I was really worried, I thought the smart phone moron will kill the shark using the smart phone. Maybe the production company paid a guy 20 million dollars to tell them you can't kill a shark with a phone.I was disappointed with the main character screaming abilities. Very weak screams and not really a true drive for survival. She looked like she kinda enjoyed being stranded on that rock with the bird. Her screams sounded like she had a fish bone stuck in her throat. No volume, no despair. No like.Ahh, the ending. The killing of a shark. The worst idea in the history of shark killing. I'm not really a fishing type of guy. But I bet those who go shark fishing, half of them were laughing and the rest of them just wanted to ask for their money back going out of the theater.Stiff and unsatisfying ending. A human being more specific a woman, dodges a shark coming straight for her, on the bottom of the sea. Yeah right.Last and least, I wasn't aware that there's any living thing that can chew and eat steel. That just doesn't happen. Ever. Yet we have a shark here who chews the crap out of all thing made of solid steel. At one point I thought the shark eats solid steel and will continue on chewing the rocks too.I give it a 4 star and not 1 since it did have it's moments here and there.

When I saw the trailer, I had high expectations - and for the most part, 'The Shallows' delivered. A solid, but overrated performance by Blake Lively, and a nice slow pace. However, the entire film blows up during the final showdown. I kept reading about the whole buoy scene, and thought to myself - well, how bad can it be? Turns out, it's some of the worst collection of scenes in the last five years. It ranks up/down there with the 'Fast & Furious' tunnel scene.Horror fans are so desperate for a decent film, it's no wonder they label this as the 'Jaws for this generation.' Yeah. It's not even close to 'Jaws' in ANY generation. 'Jaws' had superior acting to the extent of third man Robert Shaw's performance blowing any performance you'll see in 'The Shallows' out of the water - pun intended. And 'Bruce The Shark' is still one of the most frightening monsters in the genres history - where the CGI loaded nonsense we get in 'The Shallows' is borderline amateur, and reaches the point of hilarity.Random Ramblings of a Madman: I'm not going to compare the great 'Jaws' to a film that's not even as good as 'The Reef' or 'Open Water.'

Now That's Something I Can Sink My Teeth Into!",9,1 December 2016,"So many films nowadays are all trying to have almost the same tone. The tone of we are all serious, serious characters, a dark story and plot, and somewhere along the way, we forgot what it was like to have fun. (Cough Batman V. Superman Cough). Some moviegoers have forgotten what it is like to have fun, be on the edge of your seat, and invest in a simple yet very effective story. There is nothing wrong with a fun film, with adventure, scares, and that lightens the mood, and that is exactly what we get with The Shallows! Now I will admit, when I first saw the trailer for The Shallows I did not care to see it. I said it looks generic, basic, and the movie is trying to sell us on Blake Lively (Green Lantern, The Town) in a bikini. On the other hand, I decided to give it a go and I will admit I was wrong. The movie has action, a character we can get behind, pulse thundering scenes, beautiful shots/cinematography, and it is all wrapped up in a big ol' bag of fun. Blake Lively plays a surfer named Nancy. Who is about to have the most violent, grueling experience of her life.Making a vacation to escape from medical school after losing her mother to cancer. Nancy's travelled south to Mexico to find a secret surf spot where treasured photographs of mom, pregnant and flourishing, were taken shortly before her birth. She is there to pay tribute instead, she finds herself staring death in the teeth. She is stranded on a reef top rock, stranded, injured, fighting, a shark the size of a school bus!Honestly, that is all the movie is. But damn it really has everything a film could ask for. It has tension, struggle, hopeless circumstances for our main character, and overall more entertaining than I was expecting. Collet-Serra is the director responsible for three Liam Neeson action movies. Such as, Unknown, Non-Stop and Run All Night. He is a very underrated director. He even directed one of my favorite yet underrated horror film, Orphan. But his technique here is a significant step up from those. Between the big action beats, he leaves just the right amount of space for us to imagine, anticipate, and dread what is coming next. In my opinion, the scariest shots in the movie are the shots we don't see. Meaning, when someone is pulled underwater, and you wonder when are they coming up? Just to see dark – burgundy blood rise to the surface of the water. Or when Nancy has that look on her face of ""What's going on?"" Also, the movie has a very good color tone and camera shots throughout the movie. The tone starts out so bright, with crystal clear blue water. Then it becomes eerie, sinister, and haunting. The scenery, the waves, and Blake Lively all look so good and mesmerizing.So these are my final B*tchin' Buddha thoughts on the film The Shallows. It is exciting to watch, has a decent tension, and it holds your attention the entire time. It is a classic like Jaws? I don't think so. However, it is better than all those recent shark movies we've been getting like Sharknado, Sand Sharks, 3 Headed Shark Attack, Jersey Shore vs. Shark Attack, and pretty much any shark movie that goes straight to the Syfy channel. At first, I put this movie in the same category as Bait, and Shark Night, but I enjoyed way more than those films. I believe The Shallows earns a9 out of 10! Thank you all for reading, and or viewing. I hope you all have an amazing day as always, and remember, don't just get down but get Boogie. :)",The Shallows

215,samgiannn,The Shallows (2016),7,26 June 2016,"It's been a pretty dismal summer movie season with more unwanted sequels than one could imagine (who really wanted Now You See Me 2?), so it's a bit of a breath of fresh air when a fun and simple shark thriller rolls into theaters, and a surprisingly decent one at that. The Shallows is about Nancy, played by Blake Lively, a med school student and recreational surfer who travels to a secluded beach in Mexico where her late mother once surfed when she was a baby. Her alone time is ruined when she gets too far from the shore and a shark attacks her, forcing her to take refuge on a rock. Stranded two hundred yards from the shore, Nancy has to outwit the shark and try to get back to her dad and sister before becoming shark bait. In a year filled with pretentious sequels coming 15 years too late, watching a good old-fashioned non-pretentious thriller will come to a relief to many. It never takes itself too seriously, although never venturing into camp territory, and it stays suspenseful for its brief 87 minute running time. There's even a little bit of good gore thrown in there too. The Shallows is more of a survival thriller than Blake Lively vs. The Shark, so it's more suspenseful than brutal and intense. Luckily, Blake Lively gives a great performance as Nancy, a resourceful and insanely likable heroine. She's the only face on screen for about 80 minutes of the film, so it's good that she made her presence likable. The Shallows is a pure popcorn thriller: suspenseful, taut and fun.",The Shallows
216,joker-scar,Simple but compelling story...,8,19 August 2018,"I liked this film very much. The cinematography is amazing. The pace is perfect. This is the first time that I have seen Blake in any film and she is a very talented actress in this. And having her spend most of the time in a bikini, is very easy on the eyes. This type of film is very hard to pull off, well ""any"" film is hard to pull off in actuality and have it ""work"", because most of the film you are alone with one character. 
The only two flaws that I have were; 1. the overuse of slow-motion 2. The gimic of using real time Cut To slow mo Cut To real time which is as cliche' as using a pop-up window and... 3. the last 2 minutes of her ""confrontation"" which was Hollywood B-S compared the entire rest of the film which was totally believable. As far as a ""film"" plot is concerned. Overall well worth watching.",The Shallows
217,nathanjamesemerson,Very good film in the killer shark genre,8,24 September 2018,"I am a shark 'finatic' and collect all shark related movies. I was excited for this as it was one of the first shark movies to come out at the theatres for a while.I am not a big fan of Blake Lively but I thought she played the role of stranded victim brilliantly. I wanted her to survive through out the movie and was cheering her on.You do have to suspend belief in a couple of scenes but other then that, the movie was great. You really feel the tension, suspense and the isolation she feels being stuck in the middle of nowhere.The special effects for the shark were top pnotch. I can only think of two scenes where the CGI wasn't great, but 99% of the time the shark did indeed look real.So don't let some of the negative reviews away you, check it out for yourself",The Shallows
218,influxtwo,Be careful swimming. -.-,6,1 April 2021,Great small survival story that takes place in one location. Has its cliches and contrived aspects that make for an obvious plot in a sense. But the overall story was suspenseful and nerve-wracking especially the realistic and disturbing gore. Not a film to blow your mind with concepts by any means. But a entertaining and arresting thriller nonetheless. Swims right there next to 47 Meters Down and other isolation Shark flicks. Nothing to write home about but if you can catch it for free it's decent TV fodder one time watch. Nothing more or less.,The Shallows
219,fxdx4,An entertaining but imperfect shark movie.,7,16 September 2016,"Blake Lively is not the type of actress I figured could carry a shark movie, but I stand corrected. With basically a cast of 1, her ability to portray emotions and empathy with limited dialogue was stellar. This movie turned me into a fan of hers. That said, this is a movie that has a good premise, a great cast, but some major failings. So Nancy (Lively) visits a secluded beach in Mexico for some surfing when a shark attacks her and she gets wounded and trapped on a rock with the tide rising. A good, simple premise with very little else to get in the way, and the director did a good job of quacking establishing the character and then letting the movie flow naturally from there. As mentioned before, Lively is fantastic, and I found myself being pulled into her world and caring for the character. The movie for the most part is realistic, and characters rarely make inane choices for no particular reason as they often do in films like this. As the film progresses, it evolves into a chess match, where the antagonist matches every move of Nancy's piece for piece. She moves at a chance of safety, but her opponent is inches ahead of her. Now this sounds like a good characteristic for a thriller to have, until you remember she is not Sherlock being chased by Moriarty; she is being chased by a shark. Unfortunately, the movie's major failing might be the director's use of the 2nd star – the shark. The shark starts out cool and foreboding, then quickly become ubiquitous, a crazed killer that for no real reason wants to eat the skinniest women it can find. The ending causes a major eye roll, and is unnecessary, ruining both the realism and the tone of the film, but I still enjoyed it overall. Jaws it is not, a fun Friday night it is, even though I might forget about it by Saturday morning. I give the film a 6, Lively an 8 - so lets call it a 7 overall!",The Shallows
220,Ioreka,"Irresponsible, unbelievable, and pointless",3,3 August 2019,"This ridiculous film ended up with me rooting for the shark, given that its habitat appeared to have been invaded by beings that don't belong there. An absolutely stupid denouement summed up the fact that after all the nonsense there was really nowhere for it (the film/the shark) to go. I'm not saying we shouldn't have thriller shark movies. But if we are going to misrepresent this wonderful species, then at least make good ones.",The Shallows

222,deeannratcliff,"Final-fantasyxctjo, I think, WTF?",1,4 July 2016,"First off, especially real movie critics how dare you compare this to ""Jaws""? I'm completely baffled! I saw Jaws as a child being born in 1970 and remember the hysteria, why? Because it was a damn good movie!Outside of a picturesque beach, a Lively body in a bikini and the best part of the movie Steve Seagull this movie didn't even reach Sharknado level, at least that was entertaining. Still in shock people compared this to Jaws, ahhhhhhh! I'm sure Jaws is turning over in his grave!Much of the stupidest things a 2 year old would have noticed and fixed in editing. Like the 6"" bite wound from a 20' shark or larger depending on the clip. A surfer and medical student deciding to swim out to a giant whale carcass, gross, maybe she was going to do a ""half ass autopsy""on a whale as part of her studies, alone in the OCEAN!! Where no one knows where she is. Damn, how did this busty blonde get into medical school? Turns out being a blonde came in handy as she had plenty of jewelry to use for sewing up her pretty leg. The best part was her hanging out with the seagull, Steven who sadly hurt his wing. She's such a medical prodigy she was able to crack those delicate bird bones back in place and send him back to the beach on her remaining surf board!Now for the best climactic ending she is is saved by a school of jellyfish that bother the shark more than her and she makes it to a bouy that she somehow turns into a shark cage and figures out how to use the chain attaching it to the ocean floor, attach that chain to the shark before the bouy is sent with her and shark attached and at the bottom she manages to swim out of the way while Mr Shark is impaled by the bouy wreckage. Yes, this really happened. What I don't get is how the people, all involved, thought this was going to be a great movie but even more perplexing is a 6.3 rating and comparisons to Jaws!!!!Yup, the end is near, gotta be🙄",The Shallows
223,bodhi-13262,This shark will swallow you whole.,6,12 July 2016,"'The Shallows' presents a new and different take on animal horror/shark movies all together. Even though it's a refreshing take it still forces you to suspend your disbelief a little too much.1. The premise is simple enough as young medical student Nancy (Blake Lively) travels to an exotic and highly remote beach to surf in honor of her late mother. Things go array when a Great White Shark marks the beach as his territory. The story-line alone sets the film up as more of a survival flick which is to it's benefit. Not only is it about surviving the shark, but the elements, hunger and dehydration. With the setting being along the Mexican coast and a beach in Pacific waters, means the days are hot and the nights are cold.2. Although there are other actors in the cast, the focus it mainly on Blake Lively, so it's up to her performance to carry the film. Safe to say, she delivers one of the better performances of her career thus far. The only other name actor in here is Brett Cullen, who plays Blake's father, but he is only briefly heard during phone conversations. There are moments where Nancy suffers brutal injuries and it's to Blake's credit that she performs to where the audience can feel her physical pain. Early on it's established that she's a strong-willed woman, so she never actually breaks down to a high degree throughout the film.3. For the first half, there is a clear reason why the shark is present, as well as to it being so territorial, making it that much more dangerous. The attacks are truly terrifying and brings back that sense of ""fear of the unknown"" and ""what lurks beneath"", just as 'JAWS' did. However, when the second half of the film approaches, you honestly do have to suspend your disbelief just by how non- realistic things become. The shark holds a grudge against Nancy and goes at her with a vengeance, something no shark in the real world would do, especially after feeding.4. I do give a lot of credit to the cinematographer just by how many gorgeous shots and proper use of the camera, especially filming out at sea. Everything has a nice set-up, but for some reason, things take a turn into pure action. I was hoping the film wouldn't wander into a territory such as 'Deep Blue Sea', but it eventually did. It gets a little too ridiculous when the climax arrives, so the film loses the good momentum it had prior to that.Not saying this is a bad movie by any stretch, and I know audiences are gonna love it. All I'm saying is to prepare yourself and expect things to test the limits of reality.",The Shallows
224,archiecm,There were flaws and inconsistencies that got in the way,5,4 July 2016,"(Nothing but spoilers here)1. Why would a shark be so interested in eating the humans swimming around when it already had enough to eat for weeks in the dead whale? 2. Why did the camera-helmet wash ashore when the surf board stayed off shore for a full day? And while we're at it why didn't the dead whale wash ashore?3. If you stipulate that the shark actually prefers human meat to whale why wouldn't the two surfers satiate his appetite for at least a couple of days or even more? After eating two surfers it still wanted Nancy. There would be no room in his stomach, literally for at least a week.4. And with the dead whale sitting around and two surfers in his stomach would the shark still be willing to bite into steel three or four separate times losing teeth in the process? 5. And what happened with the retracting buoy chain? It pulled her to the bottom, with her intentionally letting that happen. What made that happen and how did she know it would? And if the shark didn't stab itself what was going to be her next move down there at the bottom? Totally in the shark's element?So I couldn't accept what was happening. The shark was a very human invention.",The Shallows

I can't say I'm familiar with a lot of her movies but what I've seen here is great enough for me to say this film was really good, I enjoyed it. I like films that feature a small cast and not to mention a female heroine & Lively really carries the movie from start to finish. If your a lover of those typical shark movies (Jaws, Deep Blue Sea) then you'll really like this, especially for the tropical location.
As for tense moments, definitely a third way through of the film you see many long shots of how far she is from shore and it leave you with that tense feeling of thinking, ""Could she make it if she swam to shore.?"", she really looked so close to the beach.
All in all a good film, especially if you're a Blake Lively fan.",The Shallows
226,ivan_dmitriev,I think in 2016 and onwards we should stop making movies like these,1,2 August 2019,"A lone shark is the villain of this movie. As usual, the director apparently knows enough about sharks to see that they don't eat people but not enough to know that they also don't stalk humans, because they can smell/taste that the blood is different. Moreover - great whites don't beach themselves or swim in the waters as shallow as shown in this movie - they don't have the muscle power to extricate themselves if anything goes wrong nor the brainpower to predict the safest moment of venturing into DANGEROUS shallow waters - only mammals - like dolphins or orcas ( and of course human with its tendency to go everywhere it doesn't belong) do that.With 400000 - that is four hundred thousands sharks killed annually, to make pet food or whatever's the latest craze in environment-destroying cosmetics , the equivalent mass murder of human would look like 30 000 000 that is thirty million people killed annually by strange aliens who would follow them everywhere, dynamite cities willy-nilly to make structures of their own and be a general real-life horror.Not to mention that some European supermarkets offer shark as ""novelty meat"".The monsters are human.

As a nursing school dropout haunted and derailed by memories of her moms inevitable demise, she's very good and so is the scripting. She was greatly convincing. Any shortcoming would be due the script. The surfing scenes were pretty good too, not overtly Hollywood, would have liked to have seen more. The faded split-screen for us on the phone was well done too. I love that drunk Mexican on the beach, he was great! 10/10! It doesn't seem likely that the shark would have been so focused on her given their behavioral facts. A shark chewing through any entire steel ocean buoy, for example, reaches hella far, even for the most aggressive species... especially when there's an uncontested whale buffet 100 foot away. Sure, she and others ventured into a feeding ground but why such focused aggression on her - venturing so far as to haunt her for days and take such pain to get her-?!

First of all After Jaws this is the best creature horror thriller I have Watched. Its rightfully said in the title. Danger is in Shallows and to see How Nancy Figures out her survival from a distance where she can literally shout for help is incredible. Its a Heart Pounding thriller which hits all the right chords. The Cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful and the film is carried by Clever Directing , a tight script and Of course Blake Lively who even with minimum dialogues show off her acting skills like a Oscar Winner.The Premise sound familiar , Ocean Shark Tourist Alone Survival. Still A Whole new and fresh experience. One thing I liked most about is the originality of this film which is now a days lost in Hollywood under shadows of Sequel and Franchise and Universes Fever.Only handful titles this year were original and good and some of them too will be seen as franchise in next years. In that time this small budget movie with just 2-3 characters took CROWN OF BEST SUMMER MOVIE FOR ME THIS YEAR.I know all will not agree with me but I like it and will praise it.So this s my review and this Movie is already in addition for my this year's Top 10 Wide Releases.Don't forget Steven the Seagull",The Shallows

The premise is strong too. The plight of our heroine as she's stranded on a rock several hundred feet from the beach and injured is very believable.The ending kind of goes nuts. The shark is very serious about keeping the woman on the rock as long as possible. It chomps down people and performs stunts like its on Hungry Shark Evolution.Not really boring despite the one-actor focus, so it sort of gets the job done.

But problem 1: where are the waves? There aren't any! It's clear that the actual surfing shots were filmed elsewhere. Come on... you don't surf on a beach with no waves. Sigh.Other problems:
2. A shark that size bites you, and all you have is a tiny nick in your leg?
3. There's a juicy fat whale carcass right there, but the shark is only interested in bony human beings?
4. That whale carcass appeared out of nowhere? She's been surfing there all day, and suddenly turns her head and it's magically 60 feet away? 
5. Why would you try to eat a crab after just a few hours? Just nonsensical.
6. The CGI dolphins were quite bad. But not as bad as the fake wound on her leg. I've seen 1980 horror movies with better blood... and they had a $500 budget.
7. The water is clearly shallow, as you can see in the aerial shots. Yet at the end when she sinks to the bottom, it's suddenly 60+ feet deep?!
8. Holding on to that chain would've ruptured her eardrums in seconds because she wasn't equalizing.
9. That shark is dumb enough to swim full force into the bottom of the ocean? 
10. Why is there a buoy there, of all places? 
11. Am I supposed to believe a beach this nice is right next to Tijuana, within walking distance of drunks, yet there's nobody there, no garbage, nothing?

233,anthonymichaelbangert,Good Ideas Shallowly Written,6,8 July 2016,"The Shallows stars Blake Lively and is directed by the same man who brought the world Orphan and Non-Stop, 2 of my favorite suspense thrillers of modern cinema. So, naturally, I really wanted to like this film. And I was disappointed. A young girl who just recently dropped out of med school decides to travel to a small beach in Mexico that her mother loved. It's the perfect spot for a surfer like herself to catch some great waves. But, after everyone else leaves, this woman receives a nasty shark bite and barely escapes. She is now stuck out in the ocean, bleeding, about 200 yards from shore with a nasty shark swimming in her way. The girl must try to stay alive using her medical knowledge and her will to survive as she travels from small surface to small surface with a seagull with a dislocated wing keeping her company hoping someone will come save her. Now, this movie has a good premise. Isolated, tense, all the things that make a great thriller. And Blake Lively acts well in this movie. Throughout it you feel her fear and her pain. Everything she does has an element of excruciating pain. The way she plays the character, you want her to survive. And the shark looks really good. It's CGI rendering was well done. The sound design in this movie is excellent. You are transported to the beach with each wave crashing or bit of water lapping up against something. Really this movie fails due to its script. The lines feel forced. Like they shouldn't be included most of the time. All of the actors do what they can with them. But really, they are just unnecessary. As a matter of fact, this movie would be better told, in my opinion, if they had stuck to a 90% visual only movie, with only one scene getting lines. Another problem was the pacing. A thriller should keep you enthralled beginning to end. At only an hour and eighteen minutes, this film didn't. There were moments that were seriously intense and scary. But there were also moments where things seemed to come to a feeling of dullness. In conclusion, The Shallows had potential, and some of it payed off. But the parts that didn't really ruined the experience for me. Still, I'll give this movie a 6/10.",The Shallows
234,iamianiman,Constant mind-thinking ability is what you need when you're watching this movie.,6,30 July 2016,"I watched The Shallows two times in a day. It's the greatest shark movie in my opinion. The VFX put into the movie is purely great, especially the shark. I can't name any movie that has the same astounding image of the shark which is apparently a colossal giant stalking a girl to an extremely eerie extent. It needs you to have a constant mind-thinking ability when you're watching, that's mainly the objective of the movie. This is not the typical shark movies out there (Please don't count Sharknado or any animal affiliation vs., those suck so bad you need a million punches hit in your face), the plot is highly interesting. To put it short, a daughter who is a med student visits her mother's favorite beach after her recent death. The beach is hidden in a secret location, which people seldom come about. Then, from nowhere, a mundane activity on a beach comes into a dangerous event when a man-eating shark (greedy too) coordinates a place for his own good coincidence luck.The final 20 minutes would consume you into the dark almost-stormy night. The dour tone in the background adds a more suspenseful imagery if you have the time to meticulously watch the movie, the double 10 mins would surely suck you into the world, thinking if you're that girl, what would you do?Highly recommend this to people who are loving the idea to generate powerful survival skills, if you love to surf or wander into the deep of the sea.

It's a beautiful actress versus a really hungry great white shark. Unfair right? Or the first thought I had when starting this movie was, this is going to be boring isn't it? But boy I was wrong...Nancy Adams ( Blake Lively ), is a surfer and a medical student who gets in a sticky situation; she's 400 yards away from the shore in a ""secret beach"" that only a few locals in Mexico know about. To make matters worse, a shark circles her as the tide rises.This was a great freaking watch. We all enjoyed it! There's is this small thing that made this movie extra special, 2 small things actually. Those 2 things might be small but it helped in making this movie worthwhile. Steven Seagull. That little bird made the movie better! Not just for us watchers but also for Blake Lively. Steven Seagull was a companion. I'm sure you agree with me, that bird was perfect! I also loved how he was saved because Nancy Adams is one shrewd medical student.You know what the cherry on top for this movie is? The story, I loved how connected the mother was with the main character. How Nancy recorded herself that she will be fighting as hard as how her mother fought cancer and heck she did. She killed a freaking shark man. She earned the achievement ""Shark Killer"" and conquered that anonymous beach. I loved how smart and determined she was; stitching her wounds, observing the shark's speed, fixing Steven's wing and yeah, I'll say it again. Killed a freaking shark. I also love the Dubstep music.

This features a normal shark that does seem to get a bit Aggro on poor Blake. The story goes that while surfing she ends up getting to close to the big dead/alive whale and therefore invaded the sharks feeding grounds and causes it to chomp up a mexican drunkard as well as two fellow Mexican surfers. She survives it all thou and the movie does a good job of making us feel for Blake. All in all I gave it a 8 for being a more normal yet still entertaining shark movie with none of the usual craziness. I do wish thou that the shark fight at the end was a little longer maybe?

Sharks are in it and can come to the surface any second. What if you have a small cut and start bleeding. Sharks will come and bite you, tear you apart and eat you alive. The horror of being in that situation. This problem I have probably made Jaws the most scary movie of all time (not to mention the very young age I had when I saw it for the first time, I didn't dare swim in the French sea on holiday and as soon as I couldn't feel the ground anymore, I was out of the water.)Since Jaws, many movies with sharks came along. Some ridiculously stupid (Deep Blue Sea, anyone?) or cleverly scary like this one.This movie made me scream and shiver and tensed from beginning to end. It has a strong lead character that can totally carry the movie by herself. We love to see others suffering so we don't have to do it ourselves, and man, did she suffer! I bought everything that happened to her, she has to survive and you can last a few days without water and food. (Longer if you're healthy, but in her case this was I think pretty much the maximum, how long after the first attack: 36 hours or something?)The CGI of the horrific shark was scarily good, the pace of the story was slowly building up to a big climax and who would have thought the comic relieve would come from a seagull?A few criticisms: the man bitten in half crawling up the beach, no, that's just silly, and how the hell did the water catch fire all of a sudden. Did we miss the shot where she puts er... kerosene in it? For the rest, yes, this is a very scary movie, not only if you have a problem with sharks. It's well written, has a great actress carrying it all the way through and is shot beautifully. A winner for me. 8/10",The Shallows
240,targe1314,A Sports Illustrated surfing screen saver with a JAWS,1,27 January 2017,"I went in to this movie with lowwww, lowwwwwwww expectations, badgered into it by gf and pvr'd it thank god. I was shocked at how high my expectations were...For the first half hour of his movie we are treated to slow mo scenes of hot blonde surfer girl walking to water, riding board, flicking hair around, watching cut scenes of monster waves from monster wave surf beaches that cannot possibly exist where she is approaching her, watch her surf these monster waves that appear out of nowhere in this tranquil Mexican bay, slow mo, hair flik, cute guys watch approvingly, etc.Then a whale carcass pops in from out of nowhere. it appears a gigantic megalodon sized shark has bitten the top of this whale's head off...girl get's thrown off board (while riding impossibly gigantic wave, by impossibly gigantic great white) and ends up surfing the whale. The shark is apparently NOT FULL. Girl must make it to a rock, where she spends most of the movie, with a comic relief seagull that should have been animated and have a jaunty name.This great white is ridiculously large (JAWS II and worse size) and ridiculously HUNGRY. She's (no male could ever reach this size) already eaten HALF A WHALE... but no, she must now chow down on a succession of DUMB MEN who try to rescue our blonde in distress. At one point this hate filled sea monster tries to climb up on the rock. It also dismantles a bouy when she swims to that.She manages to nurse having her leg almost bitten off, somehow she just keeps making more blood to gush out of her....The final kill scene against the shark is truly cringe inspiring, with the clearly big rubber shark doll diving head first into the bottom of the ocean like a crashing jet fighter. And my respect for this garbage movie.",The Shallows
241,fivecentscribe,Unnecessary yet Entertaining,6,22 June 2020,The Shallows is not at all a necessary film nor is it a piece of work that adds anything to the shark attack genre.

242,DanielRobertRoss,Best shark attack movie since Jaws,3,5 September 2016,"It's no secret that I have an obsession with sharks and shark movies. Jaws is my favorite film of all time, not just because there's a shark in it, but also because it's a damn good movie.Throughout the intervening decades since Spielberg's seminal 1975 thriller, we've been greeted with an endless stream of shark attack movies of varying quality. From entertainingly silly (Deep Blue Sea) to genuinely good (Open Water, The Reef), to schlock (Shark Night 3D, Shark Attack 3: Megaladon and the infamous Sharknado).I'll just get to the point. The Shallows is the best shark attack movie since Jaws. It's suspensfully directed by Jaume Collet- Serra, who clearly knows how to ratchet up the tension. Blake Lively is great as a surfer stranded on a rock endlessly hounded by a Great White. If the ending stretches credulity and goes full Hollywood, it still does it with more class than the Jaws sequels. And damn this movie is intense. Put it this way: I consider myself a hardened movie veteran. But I jumped back in my seat twice, spilling popcorn on my girlfriend. Kudos movie. This shark has bite.",The Shallows

However, the film steadily degraded when copious amounts of factual-errors and unimaginative scenarios were thrown at you from all different angles. In a nutshell, the movie is about this deranged Shark that doesn't sleep nor go away and is hell-bent on eating a surfie blonde because she happened to stumble upon his feeding time. By totally ignoring the 2 tonne whale meat which is the preferred food for Great Whites, he encircles this surfie for over 48hours without a sight to ending this peculiar hate for her. Meanwhile, Nancy happens to sit tight on a small rock for 48hours whilst bleeding profusely, suffering sun stroke and hypothermia without water nor food. The final straw for me was when she started timing the shark's movement and trying to out-manoeuvre it with timing skills, it would have been more believable if she sent that whacky seagull to call for help.",The Shallows
244,tyingling7766,Strong movie until the end,6,27 September 2017,"Extremely strong build up to a depressing and disappointing ending is probably the best way to describe The Shallows. Most of you know, I don't give away the ending, so you won't be seeing me say what exactly happens, but just know that it fell extremely flat. Allow me to explain.The movie starts out with the happy setting of a young woman who recently lost her mother decides to go to her mother's favorite spot she had ever visited; that being a secluded beach in Mexico. Everything seems to be going well. She surfs with a couple of locals she meets there, has a heartwarming talk with her sister, not so heartwarming with her father, and does some more surfing.The problem comes when she paddles out to far to find a dead whale with bite in it that could fit a smart car. Once she realizes something is wrong it's already too late. The shark awaiting more prey comes in to attack.Now, don't get too far ahead of the story. It's not a shark movie. It is a movie about isolation and survival. Blake Lively gets stranded from shore a mere two hundred meters away from shore. That may not sound like much, but when you have a creature circling you that can swim thirty-five miles-per-hour it's a great distance.The movie really does give off the feeling of isolation in the sense that she talks to an injured seagull stranded on the rock with her. Then seeing what she has to go through by what she has to eat and the lack of water gives off the survival aspect.The ending, as I have said, is the worse part. Just that they completely changed the type of movie it was with the movie was enough, but there is more. Physical, she wouldn't have been able to do what she did in the end. She didn't have hardly anything to eat or drink and she lost quite a bit of blood. It would have been almost impossible for her to do what she did.The movie up to the last fifteen minutes (not including the credits of course) was good. Not great, but good enough to enjoy on a higher level. Giving us a survival movie with a shark as the reason to survive was the right move. It was just the end. Nothing more than that.Rating: 6 out of 10That's it for me folks.",The Shallows
245,AdultAudienceMember,Is it a survival movie or a science fiction movie.,7,24 June 2016,"Spoiler Alert! In The Shallows, this chick goes out to the middle of Secret Beach, Mexico, or some other country to surf off the same beach her now-dead mom surfed when she found out she was pregnant with our protagonist. Her useless-as-a-bowling-ball-bat girl friend decides to romantically pass the morning with some absolute stranger after getting puking drunk the night before. So she heads to the beach with a nice guy named Carlos who gives her ride with no strings attached. She is counting on her friend showing up later and then having a ride back to whatever-the-country beach town/resort/3rd world latrine hole they are staying at. She arrives by herself without a flotation device and heads out. The only two people there are a couple of Spanish-speaking surfer dudes who would like to have sexual congress with her but, hey, the surf is good. They leave and she goes out into the surf entirely by herself. What a complete invitation to some sort of intimate relationship with the shallow, blue sea. If you have seen the preview you know some of what is involved. Pros: Man, does she have a nice backside. She is in a bikini the entire movies. She's got nice but obviously re-upholstered frontal assets that look just like every other set of fake invitations, so yawn. But dat caboozzz. CGI is pretty good. Movie is pretty good.

247,pendenquejohn,Presemptuous on certain aspects...,4,29 January 2017,"I really had a hard time rating this movie. Intrinsically I would not call it bad because the landscape pretty wonderful, as a would expect for surfing places that are uncommon to mass tourism; the directing, shooting, camera angles [...] are all pretty cool and coherent although I did find the action a little bit long to start.With such a simple plot, I was really curious to see how exactly they were going to drive this out and make some sense out of it. I guess, it was a mix between a C-version of ""In the heart of the sea"" and an underpowered ""Jaws"". No doubts that they really went a little bit too far attributing superhuman power to the poor baby shark who really was not asking to be that good.Ain't it? That's the problem of the movie to me. Under the angle I felt under which is was shot, under a realistic perspective, they tried to extend the shark beyond its capabilities and it just could not corroborate anymore with reality. This movie was clearly navigating between three or four different genres due to the extreme simplicity of the plot and the desire to make a ""serious"" story out of the whole thing.Sharks tend to not like the taste of the human flesh/skin and attack surfers by the purest virtue of accident. They attack them because they tend to mistake them for squeals or anyways some sort of animal swimming at the surface but have no interest in having human beings for their regular meal. On that basis alone, unfortunately, the moment the shark started parking around the poor Blake Lively looking for a meal, the whole premise of the movie came to fail.The whole Lively acting was not Oscar worthy, obviously, I'm not sure how I felt about her driving the emotions of a movie like this except probably the parts where she was feeling nostalgia remembering the good things she had left behind for her singular personal quest of riding a surfboard in the middle of nowhere. Even interpretation of physical pain weren't entirely convincing and felt more like somebody having sexual fun than one that would be really struggling from a shark attack.Additionally, Some scenes are obviously a little bit pushed, for instance, her inability to quickly process the fact that she is in risky area and escape herself instead of waiting like an elderly for someone to grab her out from there, or, the fact that a bunch of dudes leave without even watching one last time to the horizon...Finally, I have to admit, the unexpected relationship between Lively and a bird was actually kind of cute to say the least.",The Shallows
248,Bryan_Roderick,Writing and Directing problems but overall decent.,6,7 October 2016,"The Shallows (2016)I'm guessing somewhere at some time someone said: ""Hey you think Blake Lively can hold a movie on her own?"" To which I imagine the response was ""What sort of casting director would try that?""Blake Lively is more than just a pretty face. The director makes sure you see her face, with the entire film being about her experience. So if she couldn't act then any audience would notice. I enjoyed her acting. She was believable and convincing that she was the character. If she can make me forget that she was Serena from Gossip Girl then that's great.The film has problems. The shark isn't up to modern day graphics. Neither were the dolphins. Also the ending was bad. It's not how you expect it to end, which is good. I think the bad ending it due to the writer, Anthony Jaswinski. This is his first major film and it shows. I noticed some directorial flaws, or maybe they were intentional. Jaume Collet-Serra is good at keeping the flow of a movie going, I just wished there was better shots.Verdict: If you're easily frightened, this film could scare you. If you're a horror movie junkie then it'll be too vanilla. Worth watching.",The Shallows
249,the_bluesman,Blake Lively Saves The Shallows!,7,1 August 2016,"Blake Lively's performance in 'The Shallows' is very engaging. The movie is basically a one-woman show. Blake gives everything she has to make her fight for survival look realistic and she really does it great. Her performance elevates the movie above the usual mediocrity one is used to seeing in these kinds of survival movies these days. She's not only easy on the eyes in her surfer outfit, but she also acts realistically and makes you feel the character's pain.I thought it was a pretty decent and relatively realistic shark attack movie – up until the finale that is. Just before the final fight against the shark, there is an under-water scene involving glowing jellyfish, which just seems completely unrealistic and out of place to me. That scene is something for a sci-fi movie. Then there is the final fight in which the shark is killed in the most ridiculous and unrealistic way imaginable. The payoff in this otherwise decent movie is just laughable and something I would have expected seeing in a Sharknado installment or something.It's too bad that the movie doesn't hold up until the very end, but it is still a rather decent survival movie. Watch it for Blake Lively's great performance, if nothing else.",The Shallows

Blake Lively was decent not terrible not great I'd never really seen her in anything else before but in this I thought she was just average her yelling for help did get kind of annoying after awhile though. (spoilers) When she's stuck in the water after first being attacked by the shark she was just sitting on this rock the whole time injured because she had gotten bitten and another thing is they made this shark out to be stupid I mean sharks are predators they are smart plus this was a great white those are one of the smartest types for sure.

251,HorrorFreak1997,"it is what it is. and what it is, is a great shark thriller.",7,11 September 2016,"The shallows (2016) directed by Jaume Collet-Serra is exactly what it promises to be. a shark thriller with some good suspenseful scenes as well as some good effects. that's not to say those are the only things of merit here, but they seemed to be what was promised in the trailers and the producers and director deliver on that promise. the film uses a primal fear of many, many people in our society to induce suspense and thrills to the fullest extent. the fear of being stranded at sea with a blood thirsty shark. it does so with style and suspense and with a limited cast and just one singular location. one may think the film would be dull, taking place in just one location but it pulls it off with ease.Blake Lively does a wonderful job in the lead role as a young girl named Nancy. her character doesn't have a whole lot of depth but the plot doesn't call for that in the first place. her character does however have an inner struggle as well as an obvious physical struggle. her mother passed away supposedly from cancer and was described as someone who fought until the very end with everything she had. it's revealed that Nancy has pretty well chosen to abandon her studies in medical school as she sorts out her feelings and emotions. symbolizing that she has essentially given up on an important part of her life and thinks she will no longer be able to carry on after the death of her mother. then this horrific event takes place and she must chose to fight for her life and not give up even if it kills her. this ultimately turns into a little arc for her character to undergo. will she give up or will she power through and honour the memory of her mother, therefore enabling her to carry on through the hardest times and learn to never give up. while not the most complex character arc, it does add to the film in the sense that it makes her character a sympathetic one and someone that we can root for. this is the reason why the suspenseful parts of the film work. without a sympathetic character that we can root for there would be no suspense and the film would be a failure on all fronts.in terms of direction and cinematography this film is a delight. certainly not the artsiest direction ever but once again the film doesn't call for that sort of thing. what we do get are some beautiful sweeping aerial shots of the ocean and the scenery, and some excellent underwater camera-work that really induces suspense and tension. each cat and mouse scene with Lively being pursued by the shark is filmed with restraint (in terms of how much is shown to us) and excellent editing. I constantly found myself scanning the shot to try and find the shark in pure suspense. also something that should be mentioned is the beautiful special effects. Lively's injuries look realistic and painful, the shark looks better than almost every other CGI shark I have ever seen and just enough of the shark is shown. it doesn't feel like a B movie it feels like a glossy and well produced film with some genuine time and effort put into it's effects.the only real negatives I can think of here are the lack of truly BRUTAL shark attack sequences, better choices of music and a more memorable score. while I do applaud the shark attacks here I felt like we could have gotten at least one in there that was truly horrific and brutal. I think the film would have benefited from an R rating but then again it may have interfered with its box office success so everybody can't be pleased in that area. it could have also benefited from a better ending and some more time and suspense being added to some of the other characters deaths. everybody who died, died fairly quickly.the verdict: 7.5/10",The Shallows

It is definitely inspired by other shark- starring films (Jaws, of course, springs to mind) but avoids too many of the clichés and tropes. While contested by a certain feathered friend, Lively puts in a brilliantly powerful performance which is all strengthened by a solid direction and post-production efforts. Yes, I complain about the actual shark, but The Shallows is the type of small-budgeted, star and character driven box office affair that is slowly starting to disappear from cinemas, and this $17 million production is becoming more and more of a rarity and risk for studios who are now continually chasing franchises and tentpoles, meaning I can forgive the fact that not every crease is ironed out. It is a shame that these type of films are becoming less common in the cinema schedule because, as with the recently released Nerve, The Shallows is a wonderful summer popcorn flick.Summary: The Shallows is thrilling, taut and tense summer popcorn flick with a powerful performance from Blake Lively at the very front and centreFULL REVIEW: http://perksofbeingnath.blogspot.co.uk/2016/08/the-shallows-2016- review.html",The Shallows

Lots of great suspenseful moments along with a bit of humour. Doesn't get overly sappy with the backstory and is presented in a unique manner. Which actually convinced me mobile devices can be incorporated well in to a movie plot. Another plus? No gratuitous flesh scenes or vulgarity. Which again shows that a film (outside family ratings) can be made well without relying on cheap gratuitous fillers.A few scenes made me jump, a few gave me a chuckle and a few made me groan. Why? The lack of probability of certain ""survival"" elements. This surfer chick was clearly having a very, very bad day. From shark bites to bonking her head on some underwater metal. So yeah, surviving all her unfortunate events is questionable. But who cares really? It's still an interesting film to watch.

The shark, like the movie's realism, is over the top. It is not a small shark. And it wants what it came for even though you would think it would be full. But whatever, I could at least understand the shark having elements to it that were over the top. The plot line is a different story.At first Nancy devises completely realistic and intelligent ways to stay away from the shark long enough to try and survive. But then the movie thinks it needs that spectacular action finish where the split second ideas are so fantastic as to be completely unbelievable. Nancy can see things really well too.This movie had a great opportunity to be more realistic and yet still suspenseful.

I've never liked sharks and I imagine I'm not alone but this movie takes certain liberties with what I would consider to be normal shark behavior... it's not a bad movie and it has some production value but some of the plot-points are ridiculous to the point of being funny. I still enjoyed the movie but maybe I was alone in being the only one in the theater laughing at some of the more horrible scenes, I generally care about the outcome of the protagonist in a given story however when the shark is just dead set on murdering you (just for the hell of it) then I'm left wondering how it is we arrived at this point... global warming perhaps??!See the movie, it was good... particularly her co-star Steven Seagull xD",The Shallows
273,CraigsCritique,Deep Blue Success,7,4 September 2016,"Shark films....yeah in recent years we have been subjected to shark films with all the subtlety of...well a Sharknado! Lets face it it's been nigh on impossible to make a shark film without it fairly or unfairly being compared to Jaws in some shape or form and let's face it not many people have tried for that same reason, it's almost an unwinnable film pursuit.However what must be said for this entry into what can be called the survival/thriller genre, the man or should it be in this case the woman against nature battle comes across rather well and with quite a few positives to boot.So our general set up is a young woman played by Blake Lively has traveled to a secluded beach in Mexico that was of significant importance to her and her mother, who we find out has recently died, so it would appear that in part this could be read as a tribute to visit a place of such importance to their relationship but also can be read (after seeing interactions with her father via a video call) as her possibly running away or avoiding her problems at home, she then obviously begins surfing at this rather isolated beach where she not only comes into interaction with two fellow surfers but also unfortunately the attentions of a rather territorial great white shark and so begins a battle for survival.Positives begin with the performance of Blake Lively who gives an extremely committed performance, but really what is best achieved in this film is finally creating that feeling once again of the fear of the water where even the slightest toe in the sea makes you almost wince at what is to come, therefore the tension building is skillfully done between major events and there is an ultimate sense of dread, also when those events hit they hit hard in full force with one particular surfer attack really making you feel the force of nature, also the effects when you see the shark are so well created that you hardly bat an eyelid and could be forgiven in thinking that some of what is on screen is real footage.There are a couple of negatives I must bring to the fore though, I really thought at the beginning of the film the video call I mentioned earlier in the films synopsis was not very well presented and was pretty clunky, it seemed very much an attempt to say 'hey look at us being all modern with our representation of how the younger generation connects' so a pretty underwhelming use of that medium, there were also a couple of moments where I did find myself going 'oh come on' to particular events in the film but not so much that it became a major concern. I also have to point out that yes I know this is a film where Blake Lively is not going to be wearing a lot of clothes but I still think there were shots or slow motion shots where we were pretty much just ogling her at times, those instances tended to be in the first act of the film it must be said where we are seeing her surf etc and it's the case that a camera would stay on her from a particular angle for longer than what I would deem to be necessary, I'm very sure that's just me on that point so don't worry about that.The finale sequence could also be accused of being something more out of Deep Blue Sea rather that the Jaws mould, look I just did it I brought in a Jaws comparison it was inevitable, but on that finale sequence hey is was certainly inventive I'll give the creators that.So to sum up I feel it's a pretty damn enjoyable yet purposely uncomfortable/wince educing cinematic experience if with a couple of minor flaws to boot, oh also on a sidenote I immensely enjoyed the performance of Steven Seagull, he stole pretty much every scene he was in.",The Shallows
274,mrturk182,Blake Lively Conquers Shark-Infested Waters,8,6 December 2016,"Brilliant shark movies are rare to come across nowadays. The first Jaws set the bar for this sub- genre (and perhaps the summer blockbuster, for that matter), but you can say that its legacy was somewhat tarnished by the sequels, especially the last two. Infamous schlock films like Shark Attack 3: Megalodon and Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus proved to be insultingly terrible. And even though contemporary movies like Sharknado and Deep Blue Sea are too unintentionally hilarious for us to hate, you have to admit that the shark movie sub-genre is ripe for a good representation during these times. Enter The Shallows, which was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. In this film, Nancy (Blake Lively) goes on a surfing vacation to an island that is secluded, but has a significant memory tied to her late mother. As she catches a late wave, she gets attacked by a shark and left stranded on a rock in the middle of the ocean. Nancy has to use only her smarts and skills to find a way back to shore. The Shallows isn't just an excuse to show off lead actress Blake Lively in a bikini. It's a female-centered version of All Is Lost, the 2013 solo sea-survival movie featuring Robert Redford. While Blake Lively isn't the lone acting talent in the movie, she uses the solo time she has to command the screen with a passionate, intelligent performance, along with a small amount of help from a seagull called Steven Seagull (think of it as her own version of Cast Away's Wilson). In a role where she finally gets to shine, Blake gets to kick the ocean's butt and look pretty good doing it. It also helps that the film itself looks pretty good as well. The cinematography's vividly and colorfully alive, the digital effects puts the electronic devices to good use, displaying the surface screens of the cell phone apps and the stopwatch as pop-up projections, the action scenes come packed with intensity, and the script keeps a short, yet simple story going without any drifting. At a running time of 86 minutes, The Shallows is slim, trim, and to the point, resulting in possibly the best shark movie in over 40 years.Score: 84/100",The Shallows
275,AussieMovieReviews,Jump Scares a Plenty.,8,10 September 2016,"8/10. The thrilling story of a young girl who gets trapped by a shark, and her struggle to survive. I found this film quite entertaining, and a real thrill ride of jump scares to keep you on the edge of your seat. Definitely one of the best shark movies since Jaws, except this whole film is a bottle type movie, all taking place in one spot. Blake Lively who plays the main character does a good job of keeping it lively (pardon the pun) as the lead actor. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra who also directed some other thrilling films like Non-Stop and Run all night, manages to pull of another decent thriller. The great white shark who was really the supporting actor, is convincing, although at times looks a bit too cg and fake, but on the whole it is scary and holds up. I would really recommend you check this little cracker out, and just enjoy the ride. The Shallows #theshallows",The Shallows
276,Fiurilli,A disposable summer horror movie,3,9 August 2016,"Sharks are back in Jaume Collet-Serra's latest movie. Starring as Nancy is Blake Lively in a horror movie that goes by the name of 'The Shallows'. The movie starts out with the girl Nancy traveling towards the sea to go surfing at a, for her, important location. Her surfing trip takes a turn for the worst however when an enormous white shark appears that traps her on a tiny island.The story of 'The Shallows' is not all that original, movies where a shark is tormenting a group of surfers have come and gone in the past. In this day and age though where horror movies are trying to up the stakes at almost every release it was quite refreshing to see one that is as contained as this one. For the most part the movie features only one actress and the shark only really makes a visual appearance during some of the different jump-scares the movie has to offer. A lot of these scares felt very artificially set up however and only a few manage to create the necessary tension a horror movie needs. This tension fades quickly however due to the incredibly slow pacing of a lot of scenes. The performance by the movies main actress does not aid the horror aspect as she never manages to convince the viewer that her character is really frightened and in pain. I've never seen a character scream for help in such a unconvincing manner and when the movie has her break down and cry the actress has to hold her hands in front of her face to make this seem at least a little bit convincing.Riddled throughout the movie are some terrible attempts at gore, comedic relief and some very obvious attempts at foreshadowing which made quite a few moments very predictable. Though the underwater scenes were quite wonderful the movie overall is not all that well directed. 'The Shallows' is filled with a lot of terrible close ups of Blake Lively often times overly sexualizing her character. This even happens during some scenes where the viewer is supposed to built an emotional connection with the main character. The CGI is not all that great due to the movies low budget. During the different action moments and surf scenes it is very obvious that Blake Lively's face is plastered onto a stunt women causing a disconnect between the viewer and the character.In the end 'The Shallows' is a very disposable horror movie as deep as the title suggest. There was not one aspect that really stood out, though watching it wasn't a total waste of time as it was still an enjoyable (and sometimes laughable) movie to watch with friends.My Rating: 3/10",The Shallows

278,Sickpuppy365,"Blake, bikini, shark... Enough said",7,14 October 2020,"It seems that everyone who has watched six minutes of shark week is a qualified arm-chair expert on shark behavior when it comes to crying down this gem of a movie... The main complaint seems to be that sharks don't ""stalk"" people, followed by a suggestion that Jaws is a far more realistic and an immeasurably better movie (in which the shark indeed stalked people... who were even in a boat... albeit much too SMALL a boat...) Perhaps these folks also think Sharknado is a more realistic movie too...
Now I'm no expert (even living on a Caribbean island and spending half my life in their back-yard), but I have learned a few things about wild animals, not the least of which is that now matter how much we learn about their behavioral patterns... They always have a surprise or two in their repertoire.
Oh Ryan old chum, you certainly landed yourself a beautiful and talented wife and mother to your three kids (though the bikini strongly suggests you guys adopted all of 'em...)
Blake Lively had a Herculean task here, and carried it through with the prowess and credibility of a far more seasoned actor. It can't be easy to flex one's thespian chops whilst sitting on a rock in the blazing sun in nothing but essentially underpants, facing seemingly insurmountable odds, and with no-one to talk to who can actually talk back... Just ask Tom Hanks.
I would have enjoyed this movie if Blake had just sat on the rock in her bikini reading the phonebook the whole time...
The Scenery is breathtaking, and the way they trained that shark to do all those tricks and stunts is awe inspiring... Mad props also to Steven Seagull and the whale for their quietly supportive roles... The animal wranglers had their work cut out...
All-in-all, anyone who says this movie is a waste of time obviously works as an international person-of-mystery or a Starfleet captain and has much more interesting things to do than I...
Oh, and for all the experts out there, if you pause some of the drone shots and use your slide rule to compare Blake ( at 5' 10"" of feminine perfection) and the shark, you will find, as I did, that at scale the shark is somewhere between 22-25 feet nose-to-tail, making a solid argument that it is female also... Proving that it is possible to make a very engaging and exciting action movie with not one but TWO female lead characters, without shoving a feminist agenda down everyone's throats... It's called acting.",The Shallows
279,lita-ann88,Not a good movie.,2,7 March 2019,"These kinds of movies are the reason a beautiful species of animal is being hunted and killed. It's bringing about fear for an animal that we have no reason to fear. Look at the scientific data on the number of people killed by sharks as opposed to other threats in our everyday lives. It's next to zero. These movies do nothing by inflict uneducated fear into humans for a beautiful animal we are fortunate enough to share this planet with!Now. I love a good shark film, the more unrealistic, the better. As sharks don't ever behave as what is depicted in this movie. ""Deep Blue Sea"" is an exceptional shark movie! They have an outlandish story of how they scientifically made the sharks smarter. So the sharks actions & behavior in that movie are justified by the story line.This movie tries to feel real & fails spectacularly! From the behavior of the shark to the injuries she sustained. She had a couple of little cuts...from a shark that was literally chomping people in half, she had a pretty severe onset of gangrene, but didn't lose her foot or leg?

280,Vikingbyheart,The prey and the predator...,7,14 September 2016,"Since the Steven Spielberg's classic Jaws (1975) the movie industry did not have a thriller film involving shark able to make the viewer feel scared and also cheer to the protagonist so intensely. Directed by the Spanish Jaume Collet-Serra (known for Orphan - 2009 and Unknown - 2011) the feature-film The Shallows tells the story of Nancy (played by Blake Lively, known for The Age of Adaline - 2015), who goes surfing alone on a paradisiac and deserted beach in Mexico, where her mother visited decades ago. After spending much of the day surfing she is attacked by a great white shark, getting trapped 180 meters from the beach. Needing to race against time and fight for her life, the battle for survival requires from Nancy all her skill, cleverness and fortitude.There are several reports of shark attack around the world, which adds even more drama to the story told. A recent case that had worldwide impact occurred on September 19, 2015, during the final heat of the World Surfing Circuit in Jeffreys Bays in South Africa. The three- time world champion Mick Fanning was surprised by a shark attack and escaped with a severed leash on his surfboard. Fortunately the episode had a happy ending and Fanning was unhurt, as it can be seen in the images recorded on the day.Esthetically The Shallows is impeccable. The site chosen for filming is paradisiac and the direction of photography of Flavio Martínez Labiano (also worked in Unknown - 2011) is very beautiful. The scenes both inside and outside of the water and the aerial and water camera shots have created an amazing setting, bringing the viewer into the plot. The use of non-professional cameras and surf scenes manage to convey truthfulness to the narrative. The direction of Jaume is attractive, engaging and agile, exploiting well the open shots to contrast the man's relationship with nature. Here we point out a visual device that was very well used in the movie: the option to put text messages, Instagram photos and video conversations on the screen.The performance of Blake Lively in the lead role is efficient, managing to hold a difficult role in a film centered on the protagonist. The soundtrack has no exaggerations, conveying the necessary tension that the story needs. A negative point that weighted down the final result of the movie was the overuse of clichés. The script and direction have sinned by conventional solutions and could have innovated more. Still, The Shallows holds the attention and interest of the viewer, who will be tense and attentive to every detail of the story, waiting for the outcome of the dynamic between the prey and the predator.",The Shallows

It's basically a popcorn film with no real plot, little dialogue and no true reward for the viewer. It is generally entertaining but offers nothing more than passing time for about 70 minutes until we have something better to do. Blake Lively is the star along side a CGI shark and sea gull. She performs admirably with material that does not provide much with which to work. The viewer truly has to suspend disbelief in this film, as the antics of the shark far surpass what we've seen in other shark movies other than those on SyFy. This shark has a vendetta against Ms. Lively like we've never seen. Maybe he's trying to get back at her for that ""Gossip Girl"" deal. The shark's behavior becomes so ridiculous that the movie takes on the feeling of a glorified cartoon after a while. In the end, the film is not boring, especially if one enjoys a scantily clad Blake Lively, but it's also not very good at all.

It certainly doesn't come close to that particular film - it's watchable; but that's about it in my opinion.The Shallows is unfortunately one of those movies which, once you have seen the trailers, you've pretty much seen the entire film. There's not a huge story-line involved... yes, there's the main character (Blake Lively - who is also very beautiful) coming to terms with her own past and decisions she's made.I felt that once the story got going, everything slowed down to a standstill; and I'm afraid to say that I started feeling bored - far from what I expected after seeing the trailers and hype.I'm not saying The Shallows is a bad movie - Blake does a decent job, the CGI/shark scenes/SFX are more believable than most films in this 'genre', and the acting isn't anything to complain about. Where The Shallows loses stars (for me) is just the fact that the story-line is very limited - it's more of a psychological survival battle than a hunter/prey type movie.To sum up - The Shallows is worth a watch. I wouldn't put it up there with the 'classic', but nor would I put it down with some of the worst shark movies I've tried to watch (you know the ones). Location and atmosphere all work (would probably be difficult to do a shark movie that didn't involve the sea tho' - although it's being done in one of those crazy ones!). I was very much looking forward to this film; am just a little disappointed there wasn't more to it - jump scenes, shark scenes and perhaps a slightly better story line.Finally...I wouldn't be surprised if Steven Seagull gets his own movie next year!Overall: 5/10...

This movie shows what can be done with a good special effects team and the attention to detail that sets this movie apart from others released over the past few years.

She uses her sensibilities and her smarts to overcome a sea dwelling danger... the great white shark! Woe to those who find themselves in its presence, and woe to this young lady who must use every ounce of her wits to out smart the ocean beast to survive. The young aspiring doctor finds herself stranded and alone on this secret beach and her friends have abandoned her to her fate, but somehow some way she must search for a way to survive.What follows is some of the most tense and exacerbating film footage you'll ever bear witness too! A smethorga of wild scenes piled on wild scenes interspersed with touching emotional sentiment. I could peel my eyes away from what I saw. And you wont either.All in all a fine piece of work for new and aspiring filmmaker, Jaume Collet Sera.Tres Buenos Liones!",The Shallows
300,JustALittleBitRandom,The Revenant with a modern setting and female lead.,8,18 August 2016,"While surfing alone on a secluded beach medical student Nancy (Blake Lively) suffers an attack from a shark circling the area. Stranded on a rock 200 yards from shore she must find help before it's too late.A film about a shark terrorising a beach. For some reason this sounds strangely familiar? There is a lot in this film that is different to other films like it. In fact this is more of a survival style film that at times feels like The Revenant with a modern setting a female lead. While on the topic of the female lead. Blake Lively delivers what could be one of the best performances of the year by anyone and could very well be in for an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of a young woman who is stranded and alone in serious pain and scared to get back in the water for knowing that the shark is still around and the shore is too far away. With this comes a very clever and scary plot where you actually feel for the lead character and want them to succeed because of successful build up at the start of the film which for once isn't boring and doesn't feel unneeded. The film is very fast paced and tense which adds to the scare and fear factor and the intensity of the threat and its prescience. It goes by very quickly and is also very enjoyable in so many different ways. At just under 90 minutes the films does a really good job of not going on for too long, leaving you satisfied with all sorts of things like length, plot, narrative, etc,etc. It's also interesting and the plot adds to this with its fast pace and the lead characters quick thinking and initiative which just goes towards creating an even more intelligent and interesting yet entertaining film.Smart, very tense, scary and highly entertaining, The Shallows is similar to The Revenant but with a modern setting and female lead. Oh it might just be one of the best films of this year. **** <-- Four Stars",The Shallows
301,rheashah-49937,I enjoyed it........,8,2 May 2017,"Reading IMDb reviews a lot, it seems a lot of people complain about the movie being ""unrealistic."" To me, because it's a movie, I don't see how it matters. Movies require unrealistic things that would probably not happen in real life in order to be entertaining. The shark attack in the beginning where it bit her leg and we saw a plethora of blood was not realistic because no one could survive such a attack like that. However, if the shark had eaten here there and then, there would be no movie. I enjoyed this movie, Black Lively's performance was great. Best shark movie I have seen, yes, I think Jaws was highly overrated. 8.5/10",The Shallows
302,edinadental,Blake Lively does a good job,8,4 January 2017,"I think that the authors of the most negative reviews may have missed the movie's point. The movie's director states this is a movie that is about a survivor. Director Jaume Collet-Serra notes ""This isn't a creature movie"". Don't look for the ""monster"" buildup you saw in ""Jaws"" (a shark) or ""The Edge"" (a grizzly bear). This movie's focus is the main character's (Blake Lively) struggle to survive the worst possible odds and circumstances. Miss Lively acts the part wonderfully even though there is minimal dialogue in this movie. Her interaction with the seagull is the best I've seen in recent movies.The sets (a real beach mixed with a tank with blue-screens) are very effective and the tank (instead of a compromised effort always using an actual beach location) makes the movie more watchable. The lighting in the tank is superb and reminds me of the great aquarium effects in the movie ""Life of Pi."" If you are willing to suspend some disbelief and accept the movie for what it is (a survival tale with some embellishments to make the story interesting), you will enjoy this movie. The acting is excellent with a good screenplay; and the cinematography, lighting, and sound effects are well above average.",The Shallows

304,ryzah,Not shallow at all!,7,10 December 2016,"I want to start by stating I usually despise this kind of movie, but will give anything a watch and the Mrs fancied it, so on it went without expectation.With a slow start, it shoe-horns in a narrative (back story) of loss and a reason to be there and there's some great shots of beautiful scenery and a beautiful woman, she's finding herself, a shark attack and it's a battle for survival...Basic, but well constructed premise. It's no 'Blakely chick flick' though, and no 'Sharknado' type trashy but for some reason people enjoy... It's intense, it's beautifully shot, it's gory (at times) and for a one woman film is very well acted.Many gripes involve the unrealistic parts to the movie 'The Shark size comparison to types of damage caused', 'The sharks motives', 'The pain and hunger factor' and 'Rising tide' being many of the previously read bad reviews.It's not a true story and would be a pretty boring film had they gone down the super realistic route like 'Open Water' which nobody can take the time lost after seeing! Spoiler: Motive - humans are in its feeding ground, and had past experience with humans.....Makes sense although a little far-fetched for sure.Damage caused - The shark just might not of caught Blake as well as it had liked, just maybe....let it slide, it's a film! Rising tide - If something so small ruins a film for you stick to documentaries please! It's a little annoying, but you don't know the wave and tide pattern of that particular 'fictitious' island based on land mass under the sea and the cove itself. Hunger issue - There wasn't one! She tried a sea crab...didn't't like it, I'm hungry after breakfast.This movie if taken for what it is, is suspenseful, somewhat heartfelt, and short enough to work. The ending wasn't how I'd of ended it, however a solid 7 none the less. Well worth a watch!",The Shallows

So my expectation is damn low very low. At that time like rate 1/10. Watching finish it, i say wow really wow. Really thrill and totally focus how this hot woman going survive the shark attack. Really a lot of question in my mind if this worse case scenario might happen to you how you tackle it? Straight away everybody will instantly panic. So the movie tell about a woman finding a secret beach where her mom once surf board when she was young. So her mission surf board at that the secret beach. So careless she caught big tidal wave and hurt herself badly and bloody. So you can guess next what happen the shark come attack her. Ending, sorry go and watch it.

308,hugomf85,A mediocre thriller that can still entertain in some moments,4,25 August 2016,"Yet another summer blockbuster from a contemporary Hollywood devoid of imagination and ruled over by businessman only interested on box office numbers. That being said, you know what you can expect from a movie like this. An average script at best, tedious and unimaginative directing, poor editing, an OK performance by Blake Lively which actually is what holds the movie together, a huge CGI shark that doesn't convince (they should have used, at least, a mechanical shark on the closeups). The score doesn't even pop up and sometimes it's distracting and even annoying. Those are the ingredients that make up this thriller we've all seen before and forgot a week later, at best. With some moments of entertainment that will keep the average viewer interested but fail to build up enough tension to leave us on the edge.In sum, not worth your money nor your time. But if you want to insist on a new shark movie, you should instead check ""In the Deep"", that came out about the same time and was totally overshadowed by this one, but actually delivers far better thrilling moments.",The Shallows

CGI shark that you only actually see in total for around 2 minutes of the film is quite lame, I just don't understand how people are so impressed with it. The seagull is actually the star of the show here and I was routing for him more than Nancy ! Some of the sharks behaviour was completely ridiculous........when has a great white ever jumped out of the water onto a pile of rocks for its prey ?! Just a completely unbelievable story that could have been so much better overall. On a positive note the cinematography was good as were 6 mins of the film........the other 80 were very disappointing.........don't rush to the cinema for this one, borrow someone's DVD if they buy it !!!!!!",The Shallows

I will not give out any serious spoilers here but the only thing that really let me down to any degree was the ending.

311,zsmithson88,Enter the Shallows If You Dare...,8,6 January 2020,"The Shallows arrives just in time to erase the disappointing and underwhelming memory of Open Water, The Reef, and other shark pretender films. What those attempts lacked, The Shallows wields and flaunts... The missing link, or so to speak. There is a deep sense of isolation Blake Lively's Nancy experiences, which effortlessly transfers to the audience.The film places Lively, two surfers, and a tequila-affixed slob pitted against a massive, monstrous, bloodthirsty Carcharodon carcharias on a hidden gem island in Mexico. Surfing isn't as safe as some may actually believe. You see, the miscalculation is on the plate (ahem) of the Homo sapiens, for the white pointer is merely being a territorial predator protecting the immediate realm of her kill. ""Beneath this glassy surface, a world of gliding monsters"" as Dr. Higgins states in Deep Blue Sea.The ever-expanding and impending dread of the great white's prowling (torment even) of Lively, and the slight sprinkle of exaggeration while maintaining some realistic paradigm shifts, is where the successful breadth of this script and direction lies. The result is a rematch of human tenacity, will, and innovation versus the White's power, speed, and ferociousness.It's a bloody, grande 'ole 87 minutes, so strap in and enjoy the red waves.",The Shallows
312,jamie-carrick,Blake Lively shines in what isn't as bad as you might think,7,9 September 2016,"First of all, this is a shark movie. No doubts about that. No, it's not 'Jaws' so people not to stop expecting it to be better, because it wasn't. But that doesn't mean it was bad. There are only so many things you can do with a movie about a shark attack. ""The Shallows"" was an interesting look at one of the few takes on the genre. It follows a medical student Nancy (Blake Lively) who travels to Mexico to find a hidden beach where her late mother once surfed in order to feel closer to her and get some alone time. The irony is...the alone time she so desperately craved what was she got, just not in the way she expected. After being attacked by a shark, Nancy has to deal with her injuries and find a way to survive, with every plan she concocts being thwarted by either nature or the shark itself. Sat upon a rock (where my mind went to the Little Mermaid) with only an injured bird for company, Nancy has to strategise an escape plan while also keeping herself alive, all while trying to best a shark which is following its natural urge to eat. In what reminded me of a water based version of ""The Revenant"", it's quite simple to dismiss it as yet another shark movie, but it is more than that. The landscaping shots are quite exquisite and the way the music changes depending on whether the camera is above or below water really sets the tone. The pacing is good, although questionable. A lot of disbelief has to be suspended with some areas of the film such as the shark not eating the injured whale that was there for the taking and instead focusing all of its attention on Nancy. Then again, it wouldn't be much of a film if the shark wasn't trying to attack her again. The standout part of this film is undoubtedly Blake Lively's performance. With someone who is steadily growing as an actress and making a name for herself as more than just the star of a teen drama or ""the wife of Ryan Reynolds"", she definitely proves herself as being able to keep up with her contemporaries. In what echoes Jennifer Lawrence's survival performance in the latter half of ""The Hunger Games"" from four years ago, Blake uses a range of talents to make a believable performance. It's harder than you might think to shout ""SHARK!"" and have it not sound like it has been ripped from a pantomime. However Blake manages to steer clear of melodrama and pulls off an impressive, gritty performance. Her emotions are readily available to access on her face, but she is also somewhat reserved when dealing with her injuries. All in all, I enjoyed the experience of watching this movie. Obviously, as with most shark movies, it isn't to be taken completely seriously and harsh criticisms of this won't do any good. It's supposed to be an enjoyable movie experience, not the next Best Picture winner. Review the piece for what it is, not what it isn't. It slides right into the genre and proves itself as one of the best since ""Jaws"".",The Shallows

318,CyclopsKnowsBest24,"A Modern Love Letter to ""Jaws""",8,26 June 2016,"""The Shallows"" (2016) is a shark based thriller that manages to be unique from past shark films, but also pays homage to where this genre has been. From the beautiful scenery to the high tension, I have not felt a film come so close to what Jaws (1975) did in a long time.First off, the camera/editing work in this film is so beautiful I would often times find myself caring less about where the shark is, and instead being distracted by how stunning everything looks. The colors are so vivid, the camera moves with the ocean and wind, and the scenery is often breathtaking.Of course once the shark attacks, that is when the suspense spikes. Nancy (Blake Lively) is our main protagonist as well as our eyes and ears. We feel her fear, pain, and courage throughout the film. Blake Lively gives her best performance to date showing a strong, determined woman who has many layers of emotion. This film proves that she is a lot more than a pretty ""Gossip Girl"" (2007-2012) TV star.While the film has a few flaws with the CGI, it mostly goes by unnoticed. Learning from ""Jaws"" this film took the approach to show less of the shark until the end of the film. This is a smart approach because it creates more tension and mystery about where this shark is, and causes greater frights when he appears.I also really appreciate that this film used modern scientific knowledge when it comes to sharks, showing that it isn't just some psycho killer after humans but instead a complex hunter. It showed that sometimes we are at fault for making ourselves prey, which is a very different standpoint from what ""Jaws"" took.Don't let this modern outlook fool you, though. It is very much a scary Great White shark and the characters are in a lot of danger throughout the film.One complaint I do have is that towards the end of the film, the action and writing feels very different compared to the first 2/3rds of the movie. It seemed a little too fast paced compared to the rest of the film, and the build up didn't quite pay off in the way I expected it to.If you are looking for a suspenseful summer movie or are a fan of the shark thriller genre, I highly recommend seeing ""The Shallows."" It might just be my favorite shark movie behind the original ""Jaws.""",The Shallows

Obviously sex sells which is why the heroine is wearing a tiny bikini. In a secluded, unnamed beach. In Mexico. All alone. And no one in her family knew where she was. Makes sense to me if you realize this is a voyeur movie showcasing the surfer's attribute with a shark thrown in for excitement.
When the driver delivering her to the beach asked how she was going to leave at the end of the day, she said ""Uber""! Yeah, right! Uber in a secluded beach which name you do not know.

The bit on the woman's leg does not match it's teeth. A shark of that size can chew steel cables. It's bite can tear flesh and muscles from the bone and can sever limbs. Yet the woman has only suffered a mere flesh wound.After only a few hours, the woman is hungry enough to eat crabs and gross stuff, which make her puke. This is stupid. Hunger makes you so desperate after a few days, not hours. Birds have frail articulations and many tiny bones in their wings. The bones are spongy and frail.

I just saw Blake Lively in Cafe Society, and there she really could show what she is capable of. In The Shallows the director only showed us what a fine figure she has for her age. I was never afraid of the shark and sometimes laughed because it all was so ridiculous. With sky-ping and speaking to a camera the director wanted to give a modern touch to the movie but that was simply to fill the gaps of the story and nearly make me walk out of the theatre. I had to think a lot of Jaws, the movie of Steven Spielberg of 1975. Why are the old movies so much better than the new movies? Please stop with these nonsense and show us the old movies. I felt very sorry for Blake Lively that she had to appear in such a bad movie, where nothing happens. What a disappointment.

327,KingTambo,Not your average stranded at sea movie,7,11 August 2016,"I went into this movie skeptical because how many movies can be made were the viewer watches people trapped in the ocean with sharks after them. There have been a few. Most notably is the movie 'The Reef'. But i was surprised at how much this movie kept my attention. Now the reason behind the woman going to this specific secluded beach was meant to be heartfelt but it came off as a little cheesy to me. It was an attempt to give a logical reason why she picked that secluded spot. But you could tell right from the start nothing good was going to come from this trip. The shark was very elusive to the camera. This is not one of those shark movies where they let you see a lot of the shark. Mostly jump scares. What made this movie good was the tension. Needless to say the woman/victim gets trapped out in the ocean and realizes a shark is hunting her. She sees other people get eaten and killed and she knows she cant last long without some help or a miracle. So basically the movie is spent showing her survive the relentless shark that seems to be obsessed with her. At some point without ruining the story she is bleeding. So that adds a frightening dynamic to her already bleak situation. The real action doesn't come till you basically sat through the whole movie, but it is some what satisfying.

334,wulfthar,"This is the story about a surfer, a shark and a G shock...",7,4 September 2016,"...the other characters are either food for the Big Bad Shark or pale appearances to flesh out a bit the character of the protagonist.But in order, the plot is fairly basic: overattractive blonde college dropout who happens to be a skilled surfer wants to follow the footsteps of her recently deceased mother (who also happened to be an overrattractive blonde surfer) and instead of studying medicine like her boring father would like decided to individuate a remote beach in Mexicoland her mother told it was the best place to surf in the world.Thanks to a convenient tall, dark and handsome Mexican guy she is able to arrive to the secret place (which can be identified by some rocks like in the Goonies) where other two locals are performing crazy evolution with their board...everything goes great (especially the striptease and the convenient choice of a wetsuit that covers her waist up) until she decide to surf for too long almost at dawn.At that time the carcass of a whale magically appears off the beach, she has the bad idea of investigating the finding and unbelievably she finds out that a nasty Big Bad Female White Shark feeding on the whale. For some unknown reasons the shark decides that the skinny surfer would be a better meal than ton of fatty muscle and she decides to attack Blondie.Survived to a deep bite she has no choice but withdraw on some rocks during the low tide alone besides a useless seagull called Steven Seagull with a broken wing and her trusted ""Babe"" G-Shock (BG169R- 8,that is clearly shown at full frame more than once, perhaps some Casio product placement), that proved to be more useful during the long siege.That's the plot in short, as you can see it's a straightforward monster movie with a hot babe, few supporting actors destined to be eaten and a big monster whose vengeful behaviour bears little resemblance to the one of a real shark. It has been done several times, it can work or be absolute junk according to the director and actors. In the case of the shallows it works because the directors prove to be very skilled with the camera, photography and underwater sequences (in particular the shots of the surfers from below are brilliant and usual even for more rated proper surf movies), regarding the acting Blake Lively does a good work with the little material she is given...and of course she's a first class eye candy for the male audience. The rest of the cast are cardboards, in particular sister and father are present just to try to give some depth to the protagonist that would result nothing more than a playboy centerfold.Plotwise, both the surfer and the shark are way too smart and resourceful for being credible, most of the movie becomes a sort of chess game between the two, both create very sophisticated strategies to win and to be honest the way the shark is killed definitely breaks the voluntary suspension of belief more than a fistful of dynamite.In conclusion The shallows is a solid aqua thriller but the comparison with the original jaws from 1975 is absurd, it doesn't have a Milius writing the dialogues, a Spielberg directing but especially not a Scheider, a Shaw or a Dreyfuss...just a male teenager blinded by Lively's ehm ""qualities"" might believe that.",The Shallows

336,Ufo476,"An amazing thriller and so, so much more!",9,28 August 2016,"I really have no words for this movie! Most of the action takes place in a very narrow scene (the sea, a woman, a metal buoy and a shark),and yet few movies have impressed me that much! With an immensely tense plot (allowing properly at times some reliefs to lighten the tension),a wonderful character you root for from the very beginning, spectacular special effects that emit the sense of peril without becoming gory, and an overall chillingly realistic approach to a (in fact) rather unrealistic situation, this movie grabs you from the start and never lets you go!!Nancy is a young surfer and a medical student who visits an unnamed beach, previously visited by her mother, now passed away by a terminal illness. Due to circumstances she has been left alone. She goes surfing and (minor spoilers...) eventually gets attacked by a shark who seriously wounds her leg, finding shelter to a small rocky terrain which almost completely submerges during high tide. Unable to contact anyone she must now fight for survival in what soon becomes a relentless battle of wills between her and the shark. She has to stay focused, mend her wounds, overcome the pain, hunger, environmental conditions and exhaustion, and use whatever insignificant means she happens to have to stay alive until she can figure a way out, as no one seems to be coming to the rescue.There are secondary characters in the movie too, but for the most part they don't matter to the plot that much. The film centers on her battle against the shark. Blake Lively shines as the leading protagonist who, despite impossible odds, never looses hope, never bends and never gives up. She gives up a tremendously reliable, realistic and vigorous performance, and rightfully gets credited for much of the film's success, the other parts being the tight plot, the excellent effects, an all- fitting music score, the cinematography, the seagull (!) and the overall direction, although the supportive cast doesn't fell short either.And above all, this movie accomplices a really great triumph: to stay away from ALL types of clichés. (Minor spoilers: Some elements, like her trying to send message to her family, are so gracefully done that can't count as clichés, just underline what a loving and caring person she is, making us root for her even more!). The ending (the final conflict) indeed criticized by some, does require some suspension of disbelief, but not really that much- personally I found it a lot smarter than from most movies of the type. The only thing I missed was some background for the shark, who seemed too intelligent and personally involved against young Nancy, almost depicting a grudge against her, since his actions were far from typical for an animal of his kind.All in all, this is a movie about the will to survive and the strength to overcome, wrapped around an action- packed thriller package, a truly wonderful combination. It redefines and uplifts the standards for shark movies, among which it sits right at the top, surpassing maybe even ''Jaws'' (which I just re-saw and couldn't believe how fake Its shark seemed), with its high production values. In conclusion, its one of the most suspenseful and interesting films I' have seen, surpassing any typical classification to a genre. Therefore, it should be seen by anyone who likes thrillers, adventures, suspense, shark movies etch, or who simply wants to watch a really good movie!",The Shallows

338,moorejared,Wasn't as good as I expected it to be,6,5 July 2016,"The Shallows was less than I expected. There was no one thing that really stuck out to me that made me like the movie. The performance by Blake Lively was just OK and that is not acceptable for it to be a movie that centers around her. Most of the screen time is taken by her but at the same time you don't feel much of a connection to her. She wasn't necessarily bad, she did a good job playing a surfer terrified for her life but besides that there was nothing else to her. It was essentially family drama and surviving in the shallows, there was nothing else to her. I would have liked to see better character development because you really don't know much about her. Other than that there isn't anything else really wrong with the movie because she is the movie. Like I said she takes up most of the screen time and during that you don't feel any connection to her. There were some good things though. In my opinion, the shark looked pretty real along with the other animals she sees. Along with that is that most, if not all, the scenes are shot beautifully. All the shots are pure and you can tell they took the time to think about lighting and things of that nature in this movie. I expected a little more out of The Shallows and if you want to see it I suggest waiting for it to come to DVD. It wasn't horrible but I would not suggest paying more than $10 to see it.",The Shallows

340,MovieCraz,Better than Jaws,9,18 August 2016,"Yes, I know most of you are shocked that I titled this review ""Better than Jaws"". To understand this, keep reading.I went last month to see The Shallows. I'd seen a lot of advertisement online and thought that it looked like a decent movie. I went with my family and after a bunch of X rated, horrible advertisements (that we needed to walk out of the room for) we finally saw the movie.There have been a lot of leading ladies in Hollywood lately. Blake Lively doesn't disappoint. She is one tough chick in this movie. I liked the backstory and the graphics were GREAT! There wasn't a lot of dialog in this movie but honestly, it really doesn't need it. The shark was scary and the action scenes great. I liked that it wasn't overly gory but it wasn't fake-looking. The shark's habits were just like those of a real shark - they did their homework! All in all I left the theaters highly satisfied. Here are the things I think needed some work.1: Why would Blake swim TOWARDS a dead whale and hang around it? Has she never watched Animal Planet? Shark week? JAWS? Even I know not to go near a half-dead, bloody whale in the ocean. It OBVIOUSLY would attract sharks. And, wouldn't there be MORE sharks?2. The ending. As soon as she speeds down to the ocean floor (which was NOT shallow), I just knew she had the bends. It was kind of fantastic to have the shark spike itself. 3. WHY WOULD SHE GO BACK INTO THE OCEAN. AND WITH HER SISTER!? I know I would be scarred for life. But even if she does face her fears and go back into the ocean, wouldn't she leave her sister on land so she would be safe? You know, someone to call for help in case another shark chased her on a rock again? I just knew a shark was going to pop out at the ending and attack the sisters. Was that a hint to a ""The Shallows 2""?I liked this movie a LOT. I would say absolutely watch it. I wouldn't let a kid under 10 watch it. And if they scare easy or if they've watched a Jaws movie and had nightmares don't let them watch it.ENJOY!",The Shallows
341,lewiemay-12344,I friggin love this film!,9,28 April 2019,"The shallows is a great shark-survival- Horror movie. Blake lively is absolutely amazing in this role as she plays a woman who has been attacked by a shark and is now stuck on a rock far from shore as it circles around her. The shark look is amazing, it looks like a real shark and you can tell that they really cared it looked real. They have a perfect setting, which is a remote island on the edge of Australia that looks so beautiful I plan to go myself. The music in this film is good as it really carries the scenes where you get to see the beautiful scenery. It seems that I am a rare audience member that really enjoys all the slo-mo shots in this film, like yeah there is a lot of them but to me that just creates an atmosphere that is tense and anything can happen as we look a the sea looking for the shark, just like the main character.

343,lcanderson-13864,There are better and worse shark movies,5,29 September 2018,"Solid angry shark movie, about a woman stuck on a rock 100 yards out to sea with a shark circling her. A woman on a rock for 90 minutes might get boring, and they cover this with some OK plot devices and some silly ones (she makes friends with the seagull from Little Mermaid. Oh dear. Also the sub plot about her dropping out of medical school was a time filler that didn't land very well for me. There are better ones: eg the much cheaper 47 Metres Down, and (obviously) Jaws. The ending was a bit silly too.Acting: not bad. She was a good actor, but not particularly likeable, which is an issue with a one person cast.Cinematography/effects: absolutely awesome. Everything looked great.",The Shallows
344,puttmgj,Redeeming factor: Blake Lively is hot.,5,4 September 2019,"What did I think of this movie? Hmmmm. The fact that some shark seems to have incredible intelligence and waits around for hours to consume one human, cleverly thinking up new ways to try and eat her was a bit to far fetched for me. Also, Blake Lively has a very MacGyver way of using her necklace to literally do everything. Also, how did the shark catch fire? I was also very confused by the method that Blake Lively used to kill said shark. How did she know that there was sharp rebar at the ocean surface, and that somehow being dragged to the bottom of the ocean by a heavy chain would result in her not drowning/getting eaten, but instead result in the shark impaling itself? I have SO MANY questions, and the movie was way too far fetched to be good..... yet I still somewhat enjoyed it. I think that can be totally attributed to the fact that I Blake Lively was in a skimpy bikini the entire movie and it was suspenseful. Good job Hollywood. You know what sells. Now take my money.",The Shallows
345,arnaudrivest,A waste of time,1,11 August 2019,Honestly I can't add much more than the other reviewers. The sharks behaviour makes absolutely zero sense.

I was not expecting it to be as good as it was. Blake Lively does amazing as the main protagonist, and she carries the film on her own. Now, I've seen some reviews saying the shark was being unrealistic by hunting everyone down the way it did, and for me, that was just fine. I grew up with Jaws, and Jaws was very much the same. In my opinion, this is the best shark movie since Jaws, and if you count the timeline of best shark movies, then this is the best since Deep Blue Sea. The shark was just amazing. I was not expecting many of the scenes from this film, especially the extra deaths (the drunk and the two surfers) and the scene on the buoy. Oh boy, that scene had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I was unsure of what to expect during much of that whole part, such as when she shoots the flare at the oil and the ending.

349,reclined,Great summer movie,9,2 July 2016,"We really enjoyed this one-- it has suspense without gore, incredible cinematography, and a memorable buddy-character that almost outdoes Wilson from Castaway. The ending might be a little more sudden and random than what you wold expect, but it works within the just-under-90 minute running time.I wouldn't recommend it for kids younger than 10, as the climactic scenes might be a little too intense for them and as the main character lets out one f-word as she tries to scare the shark away. However, it doesn't have the gore you might expect in a film of this genre, and the rest of the language is fine, so it's definitely family-friendly for tweens and up.",The Shallows
350,J_Brian,Uummmm... Okay.,5,5 July 2016,"I love sharks and will watch a shark movie, even one as silly as Sharknado, a movie by a group of filmmakers who know it's a silly movie and that we won't take it seriously. But come on...This movie had promise. When I heard about The Shallows, I thought maybe someone, after all these years since the granddaddy of all shark movies hit theaters in the 70's, would finally put out a shark flick just as good. Then, I watched it. Meh.I'm an author, myself, so I can accept that a lot of times, in order to tell a story, the storyteller has to toss in a bit of fiction with fact to make the story as interesting as it can be believable. Such as the method in which Chief Brody kills the shark in the movie version Jaws. A sensational, though unbelievable, ending. (in the novel, the shark just rolls over and dies due to the massive amount of injuries it sustained during its fight with Brody and Quint)However, in The Shallows, which is set up pretty well in the beginning, begins to take a bit of a nosedive near the end of the 2nd act. This shark has stranded our heroine on a rock and now, anyone who comes out try to rescue her is killed, as if it's trying to keep her isolated. I'm pretty sure sharks don't work like that, but again, it's fiction.But what really got me laughing in the theater were the scenes when the heroine is trying to stay safe on a metal buoy. First of all, she has to get through a large curtain of jellyfish, which she uses as cover from the shark, because even sharks don't like to get stung. But that's what happens when it tries to come after her. But she gets stung, as well. Plus, the shark bit her pretty good earlier, slicing her leg open so by now you'd think her leg would be practically useless, especially for swimming in the ocean against swells and current. She hasn't had a bite to eat or drop to drink in over 24 hours, she's been abused by the sun, etc. yet she manages to swim like a champ for about 40 yards from a rock to this buoy right before the shark catches her.And then, she shoots the shark with a flare gun she finds on the buoy and this seems to just make the shark hate her even more. Now, it seems it's out for revenge. Again, I'm pretty sure sharks don't work like that. But... fiction.BUT THEN... this shark begins to EAT THE METAL TOWER on the buoy in order to get to her. It chomps away at the stuff like he's Pacman and the metal is just a bunch of power pellets. CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP. Okay, as far as I'm concerned, fiction or not, I had to call BS on this one. I mean, I've eaten corn chips and had a stray sliver stab the roof of my mouth, which made me slow it down on the nachos a bit, but wow, you'd think this buoy was made of gummy bears the way the shark tears through it. It's made of metal! He's like Roboshark!He backed off immediately when a couple of jellyfish hit him, this shark's mouth doesn't seem to get stabbed with a sliver of steel anywhere.And then the way she kills this monster is truly more unbelievable, and far less sensational, than Chief Brody's method. How on God's green earth (or blue ocean) do you successfully dodge a shark, that is right on your heels and behind you (you can't see it), under water the way she does with a nearly useless leg and no fins? A shark's reflexes are incredible, ESPECIALLY UNDER WATER where it lives 100% of the time!This movie had promise and potential, but I had to give it a 5. And you can thank Blake's nice little butt for that. It was nice to see how close they could get the camera to her butt to try to distract you from all the WTF moments to come.",The Shallows

Her range of expression, calm and measured delivery even in explosive scenes -- even in scenes where she is exploding -- reach out to you and literally pull you in. Here, as in Adeline and even in her short-scenes in other films, I never felt the fatal distance and detachment developing which are so deadly for a beauty like this -- sure she is nice to look at, at first anyway, but quickly she becomes far more than that, and I think it is her voice and steady expression which are the keys to her success. She has short and powerful lines: obviously writers and directors have seen where this acting-power of hers lies -- Blake is a female Brando, drawing you in with both her looks and her delivery but then holding you there and speaking directly to you. And as to the fish: to some silly comments about shark behaviors I'll just reply that the ""animal"" here is not a shark but a force-of-nature -- the fears and powers of the victim herself, battling with her and which she must overcome -- no more a fish than Ahab's whale was a whale.

Does Steven Spielberg know this?I liked the cellphone scenes but I've never gotten reception in a secluded spot, let alone a jungle/beach in rural Mexico. Gosh, and those international data charges. What was she thinking?I'd rate it a 7 but what person goes off to a secluded beach by herself in another country in real life? An idiot. Sorry, but I've traveled a lot: One does not go off on their own, to an unknown location, without a check in time, or a confirmed ride unless they're an idiot. Uber, please...didn't you see the jungle you just drove through? Of course not, you were looking at your phone.There is one scene that is just so fake it's hysterically funny.

Shallows has many continuity and factual errors and a lack of story to make up for them. Read the goofs section on this site to see most of the screw- ups.

It would eat, and leave.A flare gun on the buoy? Really? How long has it been sitting there? And it works still? Amazing!

Unfortunately, the trip to the secret place ends with a nightmare in which the main character has to face the deadly threat from the sea.
Not to reveal the plot I just want to say that the storyline is really terrifying, however not only because of the script but mostly thanks to the main character perfectly played by Blake Lively.
She is gorgeous in this movie, real and touching in her fight for surviving. Blake is a value-added, without her the movie would not be that good.
I strongly recommend the movie as worth seeing. If you like Blake Lively it is a must-see option.

When I was watching this movie I had to convince myself that I was there and the shark was not CG, and that was by no means difficult to do. Several horror films have successfully managed to capture sexy underwater images but none have done it quite as well as this movie. Oh and I forgot about all the thrills and the suspense and the blood, and the music and the involving script and the differing supporting characters within the plot. In terms of longevity it is gore and sexualisation that makes a film memorable and film makers who do not realise that are naïve; as I write the ONLY 7 films to have been released in that category in the last 18 months are Ex Machina, It Follows, Fifty Shades Of Grey, Crimson Peak, Conjuring 2, Neon Demon and The Shallows.

All movies have plot holes, but the biggest one in this movie is probably the shark who wants to kill Lively at any cost. It will do simply anything to kill her and won't rest until he's done that, despite there being a huge dead whale floating nearby.It's thrilling sometimes, it's gory some others and human beings aren't perfect anywhere in the world.I'd watch this one for pure fun, and that is something this movie delivers, fun.6/10",The Shallows

All joking aside, this is a very entertaining movie, yes you can pick fault with it if you have nothing better to do, but it is still a thrilling view, and Blake Lively is not too bad on the eyes, the CGI is a bit all over the place, how big is this shark?

368,dejected_jedi,This time is. . . incidental,7,6 July 2016,"If you're going to be reviewing a movie involving a shark trying to eat people, comparisons with a certain early Steven Spielberg film are inevitable so let's get them out of way. Despite featuring a beach setting and that, almost mandatory, dorsal fin, this is a different animal than Spielberg's suspense masterpiece. It does feature a shark but Jaws this ain't. What we have is a shark attack flick updated for the millennials. The setting is cleverly simple. In an unspecified Latin country, a young medical student and surfer goes in search of a secluded, ""secret"" beach where her mother had found some sweet swells years before. She finds the spot before the opening credits finish and then it's time for some skillful aquatic camera work coupled with some gorgeous beach shots that make you wonder why the hell you never took up surfing anyway.The film gets big props from me for not spoiling everything on the trailer as is Hollywood custom by now. Our heroine meets some locals with dubious accents, barrels and rolls to her heart's content and, despite a running time of only 86 minutes, you're left wondering when Mr. Bitey is gonna show up. But show up he does and the film does a very good job of further distinguishing itself from that other shark movie by keeping the action mostly in and around the water. The movie becomes a cat and mouse game and the fact that land and salvation is always, agonizingly within sight serves to ratchet up the tension.Director Jaume Collet-Serra manages to keep things interesting despite the sparse setting and Blake Lively makes for a likable heroine. Watch her get up close and personal with said shark and suffer thru some Rambo-esque self-stitching. The film does suffers from some movie tropes like getting cell phone signal even in remote locations and electronic batteries that never die that are to its detriment but it is entertaining for the most part with perhaps its biggest flaw being an ending that borders on sci-fi channel territory. It is a perfectly serviceable summer flick even if it won't make you quite afraid to go back in the water.Parent's Brief (Spoiler Alert) Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 86 minutes On Sex and Violence: No sex or nudity. A character is shown in a bikini. There are scenes with blood, a character receives a gashing wound on a thigh and a character is bitten in half off screen but the 2 halves are shown briefly while character is still alive.",The Shallows

Second of all, the seagull was the best character and he was the real hero of this movie.If you're down to watch 10/10 seagull acting, dramatic zooms on a seagull while squawking, a legitimate argument between a grown-ass woman and a seagull, and the grown woman attempting to eat a raw crab and then vomiting and the seagull walking away like ""bitch i'm done with you"" then this is the movie for you. (i've given you the highlights)This movie is not for sharks at all. The promos for this movie paraded around the idea that this movie was for the sharks and how sharks are so misunderstood. This movie did not a damn for the cause against shark finning or the mass murder of sharks. The movie really didn't do anything to try an negate the usual demonetization of sharks. Honestly saying once in the film ""i swam right up on his hunting ground"" does not change that the rest of the film was spent treating the animal as a monster.The only thing the movie attempted to do in favor of sharks was that it portrayed sharks with the intelligence that they do possess instead of just brainless.",The Shallows
370,maurovicmarin,"Not worth the time, but you tried at least...",3,11 October 2016,"The Shallows"" is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra starring Blake Lively as the center (and the only main) actor. It's a drama,horror,thriller that takes place on a beach in Tijuana (Mexico). So the movie is about Nancy (Blake Lively) who went on a trip in Tijuana after her mother's death, on a beach that was meaningful to both of them. As she is a surfer, and the sea is great their she starts surfing with 2 local men. They later go home but Nancy chooses to stay for a couple more waves when she gets attacked by a shark. The story starts to get more intense but it fades pretty quickly and goes from over-exciting to boring very quickly for the next 45 minutes. The ending scene really disappointed me too. I'm not sure if it was because of the acting or the scenery or something else but i just couldn't feel any compassion or sympathy for the main character, which made it pretty pathetic since she is really the only character that we get to know in the movie. Since it's a movie that takes place in only one place with such a low number of characters (only one this time) i was expecting to really get to know all of her characteristics and the way she lived, with more flashbacks. I want to compare it to the first part of the movie Saw, which is a perfect example of a really good movie which takes place in only one room with two characters. Another thing that bothered me a lot is the way she thinks and tries to help herself survive. In my opinion, her way of doing things is just too fake, even for a movie, it makes it so hard to watch and feel compassion towards her as I said earlier. I must say I thought at first this might be a good time to make a mediocre shark movie, but it disappointed me once more, making it another low-grade class thriller. I wouldn't recommend the film to anyone except for those that love shark movies more than anything, but I'm not even sure they would like this one. Good try, but not worth the time.",The Shallows

It's the same the world over and is invariable. A hot girl in a bikini can persuade me of almost anything, but not that she can change the speed the moon revolves around the earth.To add to this marine quibble, the story tells us there's 25 minutes to high tide, but the rock she's sitting on is still two feet above the water. Now if she'd been marooned on a rock in the Bristol Channel, where there's a huge tidal range, it's just possible the rock could have been covered 25 minutes later.

The film won't surprise you with a plot twist ending or tug at your heart-strings until and cant hold back the tears. Nor will it make you leave the theater saying ""that was better than I thought"". This film is exactly what you think it is, Which is why you should absolutely go see it. The film doesn't attempt to be something that it's not, and I love that about it. The script and writing is good, not great, the acting is solid, not phenomenal, and the editing and sound are slightly above average. Overall, Blake Lively did a fantastic job; she didn't ""over do-it"" and you can tell she is really coming into her own as an actress, the CGI shark looked extremely realistic, and the cinematography was beautiful (especially the scenes of the beach and the waves). You know that feeling of satisfaction you get when you buy something or go somewhere and it's everything you expected and nothing more? It's sort of comforting knowing that your expectations have been met. As uncertain as life can be, having a little bit of assurance in knowing what's about to happen is actually kind of refreshing.

I feel this is where The Shallows falls behind, some bits with the shark just don't seem believable, never the less it was a good film, being a fan of Blake Lively helped. She carries the role well, the acting can't be faulted.I can't say much bad about the movie, I enjoyed it, it was interesting from start to finish and the visuals were amazing, the setting and Blake Lively. They really make you feel for the character, her personality is really sweet, you want her to survive. A favourite character of mine would have to be Steven Seagal (the seagull), At the end when she's dragged onto the shore and she stops and looks around, and the seagull's jumping about, made me laugh.

The behavior of the fictional shark is ridiculous in the face of current knowledge. When Jaws came out, we didn't know any better. But now we do.And anyhow, it's not real smart to go swimming/snorkeling/diving/surfing by yourself, so i didn't have much sympathy for the main character.

There is nothing making you feel like you're there or connection to the characters.

378,rharrisstoertz,Nature wants to eat you,8,10 January 2021,"I didn't expect to like this movie - just occupying time during Covid-19. But I really did. This goes beyond Jaws, with real art. It surprises me to see all the very bad reviews. Yes, you have to suspend some disbelief, like the pathological behaviour of the shark. A few improbable fortuitous things like the flare gun. I'm okay with that. Movies do that. But what hooked me, aside from Blake Lively's undeniable attractiveness - no spoiler there! - was the basic premise. Stuck on a rock tantalizingly close to shore, surrounded by death. Man against nature, and nature simply wants to eat you. Literally everything around her is dangerous: the shark, of course. The sun and cold. The jellyfish and coral. The rocks and the sea. To say nothing of her very serious injury. I guess the steady source of fresh blood explains the unrelenting attraction of the shark. In this hopeless setting, with hardly more than her bikini, Blake Lively fights back. And what a fight! Far-fetched at times, to be sure, but they made it believable.There were some really notable moments. Great beach and great surfing. The GoPro. The weird luminescence of the jellyfish. Most shocking, of course, was the ""sutures"", a truly memorable scene! Not far behind that is the whale carcass. Picture the dismay of suddenly realizing you are in the water with that. You want nothing more than to be far from it, yet moments later you are clinging to it for dear life.So it was a fun watch and a memorable movie. Raw, beautiful, shocking, and intense.

380,exup,strong starter with a disappointing finale,6,2 February 2017,"The Shallows Since the dawn of 'Jaws', any shark fanatic has swum through years of terrible attempts to recreate the unique horror and suspense a young Spielberg gifted us with. The trailers of this film looked so promising, offering what seemed to be all the right elements needed to at least confidently nod towards the great 'Jaws' in a worthy manner. Does it earn this yet unearned title?. Simply put, no. But it's not all gloom and doom. This film still floats way above all the others of its genre by an nautical mile. It has the most beautiful scenery I've seen shot on film for years, and Blake Livey does a pretty convincing job of holding 90% of the screen time herself whilst playing a stranded swimmer fighting for her life against this Great White killer. The cinematography is so impressive and really keeps this film afloat, whilst lending it a much needed expensive feel. Something lacking from every other overly CGI predecessor. With some of the most beautifully shot surfing scenes seen since the 'Endless Summer' that's where the positive stuff comes to a disappointing end. The problem with this film is the content. It just doesn't generate the type of aquatic horror you want when watching. It has some individual scenes that are good but the overall tone is not enough to compete. It's almost like the writers got so far and thought 'lets just get this out ASAP' and end with some predictable scenes and some dodgy CGI, as they attempt to over expose the shark to a sad end. Instead simply giving us a few cringey shots that undo everything the film almost delivered. This film starts really strong and makes you almost believe that you're finally watching that shark film you always dreamed of. As it gives with one hand during the first half. It takes it back with the other during the last half. Still worth the watch as long as you don't expect to be treated with the new wave of fishy horror. Slick starter with stunning scenery, beautifully captured. A good performance by the leading lady. Just empty content with not enough suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. Followed by a disappointing second half.",The Shallows

382,andy-blunt,Another middle finger to the audience from the CGI industry,6,28 June 2017,"I'll start with the good points on this ""not bad but not great"" shark flick. The choice of the gorgeous Lord Howe Island as the idyllic film location was inspired. And Blake Lively puts in a decent performance as medical student / surfer dude Nancy Adams, leaving her studies behind for some ill-fated thrill-seeking.The movie also features several decent early scenes, and camera-work which can at times be very creative, with lots of clever shots of breaking waves, and mobile phone conversations etc etc.It's only fair to say however that that same camera-work frequently lingers voyeuristically over Lively's bikini-clad ass and boobs, making me realise that at 45 years of age, I am probably 2 or 3 times older than this film's main target audience.And after several too many arty slow-mo music scenes at the beach, I found myself googling the director to see if his background was in making popular music videos (it was).But a shark film will ultimately live and die on it's beastie, and although this one SOMETIMES looks good, sadly it's creators just can't resist going over the top in key moments. For you see, our critter is able to barge entire whales out the way and send them flying! Furthermore it has 1000 scars on it's body, (cos, you know, normal great whites just aren't scary enough are they?) And without giving too much away, the climax of the film features insultingly poor underwater physics and CGI, and it undoes a lot of the goodwill that the film built up earlier.The main frustration then, is that horror movie makers have been told ad infinitum that something evil, glimpsed fleetingly in murky darkness, is always more terrifyingly believable than an entire CGI beast pasted slap-bang in the middle of the screen on a clear Summer's day. Yet they seem completely unwilling to listen or care. For this reason I can only take this film as yet another extended middle finger to the audience from the special effects industry.So then, in conclusion; rank this movie below ""Jaws"" (obviously), and also some way below the pleasing and underrated 2010 shark flick ""The Reef"" (note: real shark footage was nearly always used!). But definitely rank it ABOVE the ludicrously dumb CGI-fest that was ""Deep Blue Sea"".",The Shallows

Shallow means ""of little death"" wouldn't that mean that she could just stand up and walk to shore? If you wanted this movie to make a little sense, you'd call it The Buoy! The beginning of the movie had me worried that the entire writing team all bent over, squatted down and took multiple deuces all over a piece of paper. Her name? Nancy? its 2016, show me anyone born after 1990 that is named Nancy. The med school/deceased mother backstory allowed viewers to become more attached to her, and in turn, made her much more prepared for the situation she was in. The acting was lame and i don't think that the writing influenced her role as much. i know she is a bad actress and was only on screen to look phenomenal. Anyway on to the few good parts. I loved the final shark scene that was interesting. The only thing i can say about the other shark attacks, well actually, all of the shark attacks, is to show the people getting ripped up. I know its gory and sounds disgusting but maybe if i saw those 3 Mexican's get ripped to shreds i would give this movie a 5 or higher. Due to the lack of detailed attacks though, ill leave it at a 4.

Too much unnecessary (& CONTRIVED) back-story here screamed desperation, and made us think we were watching something that was much deeper than it was. This is an isolation movie about survival, that's it. Spend another four days on the script and think of some smart motivational twists that work within the given space.

392,joshuaprentice,"Best Shark Movie Since Jaws, which really doesn't say much",8,16 August 2016,"Don't let the headline fool you, I loved this film.Its been over 40 years since Steven Spielberg brought us the original summer blockbuster Jaws, and made millions of people terrified of sharks. Since then, film hasn't been kind on the shark genre, which even Jaws had its disasters. My top three Shark movies going into this were as follows: Jaws, Jaws 2, and Deep Blue Sea. When the thirds a dumb guilty pleasure, it really shows how sub par shark films have become since the first Jaws burst onto the scene. As such 'The Shallows' has instantly jumped into a solid second place on my personal preference. This film was great. Two things that have let this genre down is the fact the plots are to over the top and about the sharks, and characters have been to vanilla for us to care about. This film rectify's both these missteps in glorious fashion. Firstly, the main character, played brilliantly Blake Lively, is someone you can get behind, and believe in her capabilities, actually caring for in the process through just a couple of simple scenes. Minor character development spoilers here. Film making 101 is you have to make a character fit the story. This film needs a surfer who can survive by herself when injured and can think on her feet. They establish in two quick scenes (in the truck and during a phone call) that she is thinking of dropping out of medical school cause her mum died of cancer and she has lost belief in it, and the father establishes her mum was a fighter. Thats it, immediately you believe she's capable of guerrilla treating herself once attacked, you see her family and get the relationship straight away, making her a believable protagonist we can root for. She just felt like a real person.The second point makes this plot simple, like a shark movie should be, a surfer accidentally stumbles into a sharks hunting ground, (thats right the shark is actually attacking for a reason other than just because), and is stranded adrift a reef within that hunting ground. Thats it. It's a simple suspense film, and my god does this film do that well. There are no real cheep jump scares, as they let the visuals do the talking, and you watch this person struggle internally to survive on this rock with her little companion Steven the Seagull, who at times made the film amusing, but that was more than welcome in the tension that drives the film, as you can't have your audience tense the entire time. The suspense is done very well in this film and while I am taken out of the film occasionally, it keeps pulling me back in. The Shallows does something every shark film seems to fail in. Less shark. You hardly see the shark at all, there is a beautifully shot scene where you see its silhouette in the wave before the first attack, and when we do see the shark for the most part it looks good, apart from one of its kills. You only ever see the shark kill once person on screen and that works to the films credit. It know's when to show the shark and when not to, brilliantly replicating the atmosphere of the original Jaws movie. The cinematography, lighting and soundtrack build the tension, and when the shark does show it is earned. The cinematography is beautiful in this film, it is so good to look at, and the shot mentioned earlier to the surfing montages are a highlight. That being said the film had short comings. There is an obvious shark bate character clearly their to enforce the threat, i can be repetitive at times, and like I said the seagull did take me out of it occasionally, but I loved that seagull all the same. Also, a couple of characters do approach the situation a little to stupidly. If you like simple films, in only a couple locations and also are a suspense junkie then this film will definitely satisfy. Think 127 Hours but instead of a boulder its a shark. The finally alone is worth giving the film a watch. Definitely check it out cause in this mediocre summer blockbuster season, this film is a breath of fresh air, and deserves more recognition. 4/5",The Shallows
393,pconley22,A Good Movie That Could Have Been Something Better,6,13 July 2016,"As a shark fanatic (thanks, Jaws), I was excited to see The Shallows. When I first saw the trailer, I thought the concept--more 127 Hours than Jaws--was interesting: A single person, alone on a rock, trapped a mere 100 or so yards offshore, in shark-infested waters.Most shark movies follow the Jaws formula to a T: Shark attacks a bather, someone in position of authority decides something must be done and the beaches should be closed, someone of higher authority thwarts that attempt, more people die, our hero finally has to confront the monster. But The Shallows produced a new and fresh take on the same old fish tale. The first half of the movie is similar to Open Water, relying on tension and little fanfare. Then, the shark explodes onto the screen for a few moments, and the movie suddenly becomes a high octane thriller. Basically, though the shark is the main antagonist of this story, all the scenes with the shark in them are much less interesting. I was more engaged with Blake Lively and that damn seagull. She was likable, and I bought into the survival story and was really rooting for her.There were moments, when The Shallows relied on suspense, that the film become Hitchcockian in tone. We know the shark is out there, but we can't see him. The second we do, the suspense dies instantly. Parts of the movie were small and intimate, much like an independent film. And those were the strengths.But it almost feels as if the director wanted to do a mash up of a simple suspenseful stalking movie, combined with elements of a survival movie. And again, all that worked for me.But the sensationalism of the shark stuff was over the top in my opinion. It gave the movie an uneven feel. It was, at times, both a suspenseful stalker type movie with survivalism thrown in, and, then, seemingly out of nowhere, it became an over-the-top summer blockbuster type movie. It gives it the look of a movie where director and producer didn't see eye to eye. It really seems like the shark action sequences were forced into the movie. They just didn't fit the overall tone. That's this movie's biggest downfall. Yes, the shark has to be there, yes he has to be dangerous. But the way it is presented through the film needs to fit the overall tone of the movie. At one point, the shark eats three people in the course of-- what?--an hour or so? So what was set up, was a small movie. An intimate movie. Something closer to The Blair Witch Project or Open Water, but what we got in the end, was something closer to Friday the 13th.This movie could have been so much more, by being so much less. Excess is not always best. In all fairness, The Shallows could have been much worse too. The things that did work, worked well--well enough that with some inventive direction, could have carried the film by themselves. But alas, the over the top violence and sensationalism trumped suspense and creative storytelling, which downgrades The Shallows from something special and unique, to just a ""good"" movie.The locations were beautiful, and seeing them in 4K HD on a huge screen was quite impressive.",The Shallows

Most of the blood is Ms Lively's but hey, it's her show. Not a horror in any real sense, too much of the horrific stuff was hinted at and not shown. This was a movie that engaged me right up until the end when the shark was killed. Looked like something out of SharkTales or Looney Toons, completely blew the whole suspension of disbelief and reminded me that this was just another movie. Lost its whole score at that point and only gained a 6 because the rest just about made up for it. The sharks death was where this movie ""jumped the shark"".",The Shallows

The Shallows is more than not worth your money, but it's not worth the time of the movie. This should have been made for TV, how it got the big studio budget it did is a mystery to me. The movie starts out seeming like it may have a prospect of being decent. Even the first third of the movie has you thinking it might have been worth the price of the ticket. The movie continues repetitively and underwhelming until the last quarter of the movie where the eye-roll worthy action starts. The movie is marketed as ""you'll never expect how it ends"" which I can't decide as being completely false advertising or a spot on description (I truly didn't expect the film to end as lazy and terrible as it did.)

The first victim of the great white shark was a old whale and then Nancy became the moving target by gone into the hunting territory of it. The shark attacked, Nancy got hurt and stranded on a small rock.

Desperately, she record all her final words to her younger sister and father by a GoPro camera and then thrown it awayThe cat & mouse game finally end with the well- done script which reminds me how the Rogue (2007) end and I assumed that it definitely pleased the audience .

But still, I was expecting a great thriller that would live up to the ages and I got instead a good summer blockbuster. Like I said, Blake lively is really good in that role as you can feel her hurry and her distress for the entirety of the 86 minutes of the film. The movie is a little slow on the start but when the pace speed up, you can expect some good jump scares. The story is little short and that is really what hurts the film, some major plot holes being really obvious, although the CGI shark is really impressive and gives cold sweats at times. Overall, a great cinematography (good job Flavio Labanio) and a 127 hours-type of feature (really good at being a small scale movie) help ""The Shallows"" being a fun ride, but no more. *******/10",The Shallows
401,follin-greg,Blake vs Shark,5,7 August 2016,"2016 has certainly given us some pleasurable slugfests thus far. Trump vs Hillary. LeBron vs the Golden St Warriors. Stark vs Bolton. Weekly Sunday Night Chinese Food vs My Aging Metabolism. And now we have Blake Lively vs Shark. A matchup that might seem more lopsided than the demographics of the Scripps National Spelling Bee at first glance, but will end up going a satisfying yet brisk 12 rounds. I won't say who is LeBron and who is the Warriors in this situation, but I will say that I've tended to root for Shark throughout his entire filmography.. except of course when he's pitted against the lovable Ian Ziering. (btw – I highly recommend Sam Donsky's brilliant celebrity profile of Shark on The Ringer.)This isn't to say, by any means, that this is a great movie, not even close. You will not see up close cutaways to Lively and Shark (with a grinning Ryan Reynolds in the background trying to hide his jealousy) during the Oscars telecast next February. Rather, it's a savory 87 minute, comfy excursion from DC swamp season. Yes it's cheesy, yes Lively has a few too many conversations with herself, but the suspense hits for the most part and I was actually quite impressed with a lot of the under water cinematography (although this may not translate as well on a smaller screen).",The Shallows

408,starinterstellar,Why is Hollywood obsessed with good looking models and even worse scripts?,3,19 August 2016,"If your an actor or not you may still understand where I'm coming from: So much film these days is noneducational and non entertaining and this shallow Shallows is no exception. usually down to script and cast.For whatever reason Hollywood is obsessed with making absolute nonsense that unlike the movies of the 60's 70's and 80's are becoming more and more sex orientated. I BLOODLY LOVE SEX.. However I don't bloody love the Keira Knightly thousand mile open jaw state repeated over and over to the point of boredom that nearly every good looking model Hollywood lead. It's so lame and so tiresome. People call this ""Good acting ability"" or ""Believable performance ability"" when it simply is neither good nor believable and the only entertainment if you like soft or hard porn is a female body adapting an entirely catwalk style facial and bodily performance. Who wants to look unsexy on screen?? Let me try to explain in a slightly more annoying clinical fashion so you can see where the tired audience is coming from.The Hollywood 1000 mile female stare: The jaw drops very slightly and shows the bottom third of the very white very, very healthy looking teeth or a very slight pout. The eyes are open wide, not too wide but wide enough for us to see that they're simply not effected by the salt water in the ocean. Normally the eyes are clear and the camera department take full advantage of the sunlight and iris colour enhancement before going through grading. Facial expressions or movements? They're really isn't one. It's supposed to be a sultry looking fear but it's essentially a pose IE the face doesn't express real fear but feigns it for an aesthetic sexual approval. How do we know? If your not into actor analysis take a look at Lorraine Gray as Ellen Brody in Jaws or Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood in Indiana Jones or Mellinda Dillon as Gillian Guiler in Close Encounters of The Third Kind. Without going into further pedantics with regard to facial and audible performance these actresses are all incredibly ""BELIEVABLE"" and ""TALENTED"" because we can realistically break those performances down and can easily scientifically ( without having to be a science wizard) break down the differences between honest human behaviour and bullshit Hollywood sexed up nonsense.If you want yet another boring Hollywood remake trying to take advantage of disproportionate pretty sexed up model performances instead of sincere performances projected from well written colloquial scripts and interesting stories then I suggest you wait for a TV release. MEMORABLE FILM IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO FIND BECAUSE Hollywood CASTS MORE AND MORE SEXED UP AND 'COOL MODEL LOOKING PEOPLE' WHOSE PERFORMANCES ARE BY ENLARGE VERY UNBELIEVABLE WHEN COMPARED WITH ACTORS AND WRITERS WHO CAN PERFORM AND WRITE REALISTICALLY AND HAVE THOSE PERFORMANCES ANALYSED WITH A FINE TOOTHCOMB FOR THEIR REAL SKILLS TO GIVE PROPER SUBSTANCIATION FOR PEOPLE THAT KNOW AND ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT FILM BEING MEMORABLE.

409,wytsharkmedia,Tedious and terrible - SPOILERS,3,27 June 2016,"Pluses:Location photography is wonderful. Blake Lively is easy on the eyes and has some good moments acting wise. The Seagull steals the movie -- best character and best character arc by far.Minuses: 1. The Seagull is the best character and has the best character arc in the movie 2. Overdirected in all the wrong places 3. Doesn't establish the water as the threat rather than the shark (a la Jaws), so all the tension lets out the moment the shark drops under the waves 4. CGI overkill. Clever mix of CGI and practical effects is the key, why does this simple equation still elude so many directors?? 5. Blake Lively also has some very bad moments acting wise. Mostly when it comes to moments of peril. Part of this may have to do with the fact that a portion of this movie was shot in a giant pool. If you want to do this right, go Revenant with it and stick her out in the ocean. It would have informed her performance more. 6. Not shot entirely in a real environment. So many scenes were clearly shot in a tank with the backdrop put in digitally. The scenes that are actually shot on location feel much more visceral. Had the whole movie been that, this likely would have been a different review. 7. Terrible terrible script!!! This was a Blacklist script? Seriously. Unless someone went through after the fact and tagged on a bunch of unnecessary plot arcs and hack dialogue onto a brilliant script, we may all have to reassess Blacklist's veracity. This is absolute garbage. Had this just been about a surfer chick nursing her grief with a world tour trip to all her late mother's favorite surf spots who then runs afoul of a rogue shark things would be fine. But no, there is this added on backstory of her dropping out of medical school, and a stock father and sister who spout inane expository dialogue. For what? I don't care whether she goes back to medical school or not. Completely unnecessary and offers no stakes. And the last scene of the flick is teeth clenchingly bad. The absolute worst kind of wrap-it-all- up-with-a-bow happy ending nonsense that is the hallmark of terrible movies. 8. NO STAKES. Nothing builds from one moment to the next. There are just sporadic moments of watered down shark attack mayhem interspersed with indulgent and unnecessary slo-mo shots of Blake Lively looking off into the horizon.9. Inconsistent physical state. One scene Lively is close to death with sores on her lips and eyes burning red from dehydration. The next scene she's swimming with Olympian vigor and her complexion is vibrant and crystal clear. Never once did I fear that the elements might kill her before the shark did. 10. Stalker level overkill of T&A. Can't believe I'm complaining about this but by the 10th time the camera was crammed up Lively's butt or down her cleavage I was over it. Give us one or two shots to show off her body and move on. She's beautiful and deserves the attention, but when bikini shots outnumber shark shots in a shark movie you've gone too far.",The Shallows

430,cherocha,Unbelievable Horsecrap,2,22 July 2017,"I'm willing to suspend belief while watching a B-Movie with an absurd and implausible screenplay, but this one went so far beyond what a movie can get away with while still taking itself seriously, that I'm stunned it wasn't universally panned.Blake lively cops a shark bite and spends the movie stranded on a rock. The main problem? That same shark, which for some reason was portrayed as being maybe 12 feet long when it gave her the equivalent of a nip, suddenly turns into a giant megalodon capable of flipping a large whale carcass, tearing 3 other people in half like they were bite-sized nibbles, literally sawing through and shredding the metal framework of a buoy as if it were butter before the laugh-out-loud moment at the climax where it swims with the momentum of a steam train into the ocean floor.There are a myriad of other problems, such as when they try to posit that the shark has an aversion to jellyfish, which sharks don't. Unless they got stinging tendrils directly in their eye, which would be easily avoided thanks to the membranes that cover and protect their eyes, the shark wouldn't even feel a jellyfish nor be phased by some stinging coral. And that's the least of the scientifically inaccurate liberties the movie took.It's taken decades for the general public to overcome the misconceptions about sharks created by films like Jaws, then this absolute turd of a movie comes along and tries to portray one as a vengeful monster that's been wronged by humans (a hook hanging out of it's mouth) and is now on a single-minded vendetta to stalk and kill people for the sport of it.The script is a dud, with some cringey 'mom died so daughter goes in search of the spirit of adventure at some beach the mom loved to pay homage while making a life decision about whether or not to be a doctor' unnecessarily crammed in there to try to lend emotional gravity where there is none. The only redeeming feature is Steven Seagull. He's the only character the audience could be reasonably expected to invest and care in. From the constant idiocy of the protagonist, to the idiocy of the shark's victims, to the CPR-ignorant savior; the movie is easily one of the worst films I've seen in years. At least Sharknado had the decency to not take itself seriously. This movie tries it's best to be a suspenseful thriller but ends up falling into the category of ""so bad it's not good or bad, just a waste of a budget and the audience's time"".Avoid this steamer like you would a rotting whale carcass.",The Shallows

I just have one objection :(

It's just stereotypical villain that has no real motivation",The Shallows
432,WalterKovacks,Brilliant idea ruined by over the top Hollywood ending.,5,21 September 2016,"I won't lie, I had high hopes for this film. Blake Lively openly stated that hubby Ryan Reynolds largely ignored thriller Buried was her motivation for doing The Shallows. That coupled with the promise of an Open Water / Jaws ""less is more"" atmosphere was enough to sucker me in. And for the first half, it delivers. Everything in the first 30 minutes of this film seems plausible to a non surfer like myself. Granted it's the worst case scenario, but none the less it all seems very possible. Shark attacks are rarely fatal (sharks do not EAT people), high and low tides can change the geography of the sea on an hourly basis, and people DO get stranded at sea. Fine. So far so good. Then it all goes a bit........... Matrix-esque, as Blake Lively suddenly seems to be able to bend nature against its will. She also manages to go from being at deaths door from dehydration, shock, and insetting gangrene, to being able to out swim, outsmart, and generally outdo a great white shark, all while being immune to jellyfish stings, blood loss, sunstroke and um.....drowning. She also seems to have perfect vision underwater. But this is not a one sided battle, Mrs Van Wilder is equally matched by natures perfect killing machine, Agent Shark. Who it seems can also bend the rules of nature, as well as shark-kind (thankfully though we're spared any jaws sequel style ""roaring"", or Deep Blue Sea backwards swimming, which even I know is impossible). It really is a shame, because this could have been a great psychological thriller, amping up the tension from a slow circling predator that's simply biding it's time waiting for its prey to run out of options and just take a leap of faith. Sort of a Blair Sea Witch. That's not to say it doesn't have its moments. The shot of the sharks silhouette behind the surfed wave is genuinely unnerving and exciting. As are the overhead shots of it circling Mrs Deadpool. Even the jump scare Go Pro opening is well done. But it's all for nothing due to the infuriating second half, where we simply see way to much of the shark way too early. For a film that's well under 90 minutes, the shark gets a surprising amount of broad daylight screen time. And that's what really robs this film of its integrity. That and the ridiculous ""disposal"" of Agent Shark, who suffers a death so preposterous you'll be shocked for a few seconds (due to some pretty well placed timing by the editor), and then find yourself laughing at the sheer absurdity of it. All in all this had the chance to be a major contender, it really does start well, and even tags a moment of truth in its last scene by inferring that surfers who are attacked by sharks do go back in the water. Sadly though coming back to reality for the last two minutes can't excuse the over the top second half, poor CGI backgrounds (that stand out a mile on Blu Ray, let alone 4K), and a general waste of a very good idea.",The Shallows

Being nearly naked adds an extra element to her vulnerability and lack of resource to keep her from being part of the food chain.Blake Lively does a great job of keeping things interesting with little dialogue other than talking to herself and a seagull.There are a couple ""we need a bigger boat"" moments that come mainly at the end it it starts eating through metal.

For that reason alone, I didn't give this movie a 0. Why did she agree to do this movie? This cannot be good for her career. Anyone's career. Her acting was horrific but I doubt any actor could have looked good in this horrible script. I can only imagine how Blake Lively must have cringed while watch this movie. The only bright spot for her must be that once she's older, she can look back to this movie and remember how gorgeous she was. This movie was so bad it was laughable.

442,jessicapiers-13959,Gripping and visually stunning,8,24 April 2017,"I almost didn't watch this movie due to the negative comments on here. So glad I did. I now realise the majority of negative reviews are completely dull, nit picking and also so snobby. Are you really watching a shark movie imagining a groundbreaking, life affirming film that also manages to show shark attacks as accurate reality? Most negatives are about the unrealistic nature of the shark, and poor use of CGI. Perhaps in the final part of the film, this is true. However the tension was so well developed by then it doesn't matter, you see the actual shark fleetingly and in very fast paced scenes so whoever really has time to pause the movie, get your magnifying glass out for a close inspection and dwell on this has to much time on their hands. The shots of the ocean, beach and surfing are utterly stunning, combined with a great soundtrack. Blake Is surprisingly good and more than able to command your attention, being on screen for 95% of the movie, for the duration. The tension is well portrayed as you will be going through various scenarios/outcomes/plans yourself in your own head, and her actions are all cleverly thought out- seeing as she has more then enough time on your hands, being stranded on a rock, is more than plausible. The review under this slated the movie for showing her resorting to eating a crab! Oh my, shock horror! Well actually- she spat the crab out to feed the seagull. And YES, you would be more than hungry, lying in full beam of the sun, injured, already having surfed all day and swam for your life, so to criticise this is ridiculous.

The reason I signed up to give a review of this movie? It could have been a slam dunk 10 out of 10... If not for the last 15 minutes.The ending lacked the same fervor and caliber as the first 90% of the movie. They did a lot of things right- they kept the shark to a minimum, they built suspense. Blake was amazing- she carried the movie, and I never felt bored. She was the only main character on screen for the whole time- and she never disappointed me. ***BIG SPOILER ALERT WITH THE ENDING***The end? Ruined it for me. From out of nowhere came really bad CGI, and an incredibly unrealistic ending. The first part of the movie made this worthy of an impending Oscar. The last 10-15 minutes, the ending- sucked. The ending would have been better if they left things unresolved, had her eaten, or just left her on the rock.I could see Lively winning a best actress award, and the movie winning best picture- If they followed through on the first 90% of the movie.The ending ruined this movie- but I still recommend it because of the fact that 90% of this movie was pretty good.I'm a nobody, I have zero experience in the film industry- I could have written a better ending on my lunch hour than they gave to the public. All in all, it's a 7 out of 10. Could have been a 10 out of 10 though- and that's frustrating. They should have panned out with her on the rock and left the viewers to their imagination.

I don't go often because I find a lot of what's out there is total crap. But I digress.The shallows delivers a survival story of a determined young woman who goes to an unnamed beach on the coast of Mexico, and fights for her life. Blake Lively's performance as Nancy Adams is convincing and keeps the movie ""afloat"". Films like this require a strong lead character, and actor, or else it just won't work. Much of the film rests on Blake's performance, as most of the movie is the character Nancy stuck on a small rock. Blake doesn't disappoint. The rock plays just as big a role. Though lifeless and inanimate it serves it's purpose, Blake knew what to do, like when she worked on ""Gossip girl"" with Leighton Meester (hint hint hint hint hint hint). I found it harsh some critics who said Blake's performance was a surprise. She's a great actress, and this film shows she can hold our attention. She has that ""it"" factor that makes people like me-who seldom go see films in the theater-get up and open our wallets. I had a great time.",The Shallows

447,caoimhemglally,strong performance from Blake Lively,7,14 August 2016,"I hadn't heard much hype about this film as all I had seen were a couple of trailers before other movies in the cinema so I wasn't sure what to expect. The main attraction to this film was that Blake Lively was starring in it and also the fact that everybody loves a good shark thriller and there hadn't been any successful ones made in years. I would never have put Blake Lively as 'serious' actress but after seeing The Shallows I feel that she really proves herself as a well capable actress. Taking into consideration that Blake is the only actor with any screen-time bar a couple of minutes at the very beginning, she did an unbelievable job and I feel it was an outstanding performance reminiscent of Tom Hanks in Castaway and Leonardo DiCaprio in The Revenant. Movies where there is one actor on screen for the majority of the running time with very little dialogue, are very tricky, as the single actor has to keep the audience interested on their own for the duration of the movie. Blake did this precisely and as an audience member, I feel like she really captured the authenticity of what we as humans endure, to survive and how adrenaline gives us our superhuman abilities in abnormal circumstances. I think Lively's performance is fair to compare to Oscar-winning actor's DiCaprio and Hanks as she did just as good a job but will not get the recognition she deserves. If it is the fact that she is a woman I do not know, but I feel her performance was flawless and proved that female actors are just as capable as men to carry an entire movie on their own.A flaw I found with the movie was the CGI of the shark itself. It looks fake and computerised which ruined the effects for me and I was taken out of the realness I had previously felt while. The special FX look like they would have been remarkable back in 2002 however, not up to 2016 standard which I found extremely disappointing. Regardless of that, something that did impress was the breathtaking cinematography of the waves and movements of Blake and her fellow actors being attacked by the shark as well as being pulled by the undercurrents of the water. This was true cine- magic and I found myself constantly asking '""how the hell did they film that?"" throughout the movie.Overall, Blake Lively was really what did it for me and in my opinion it was a real breakthrough performance which put her up on a pedestal with the likes of Reese Witherspoon, Sandra Bullock and Jennifer Connolly, to name a few. Acting was consistent throughout and although the shark was not as 'real' as I had hoped there were still many jumpy bits that had me on the edge of my seat.",The Shallows
448,master-79014,The best shark movie I've seen,8,3 September 2016,"A big con of this movie, is the trailer. Once you've seen it, you'll have plenty of moments in the movie that you'll recognize and probably know what's going to happen next. Nevertheless if you compare this movie with number of other shark movies, I'm sure you'll like this one most. The way Blake Lively is able to play as main character is insane! The movie contains just a small amount of actors, and is slowly starting. The movie plays in a small setting, but there are plenty factors to make it interesting. Since she is trapped on a small stone near the cost, she is not able to speak to anyone, that could make the film boring, but it is the opposite. Mimicry is one of the most important things in the movie and Blake really nails it! It is a cat and mouse game between her and the shark, and the end is a bit weird, but surprising.",The Shallows

Especially when there is a giant whale lying dead a few yards away from the rock. It gets to a point where the shark is ready to do anything to eat this lady, I get a Jaws 3 feeling where the shark traveled to the Bahamas just to try to kill these people. The end really threw me off, It was such an unrealistic ending, she knew that the sharpy thing was there and that the shark was going to follow her all the way down to the bottom and die. Not taking into consideration that if the shark didn't follow her or if it attacked in another angle she would have been shark food.All and all I would not recommend this movie if you want to see a human vs animal thriller.

454,alexander-184,"SCARILY SEXY, Suspenseful, & SHARKINGLY GOOD.",8,5 July 2016,"Movie: The Shallows Feeling as the credits roll: Loved It, Scared to Surf, Good Movie. Movie Rating: 8.0/10 Soundtrack Rating: 7.0/10Watch in IMAX?: Not essential. Not filmed with IMAX camera's. Watch in 3D? Not essential. Not filmed with 3D camera's.Movie Review:I was immediately brought into the story as the main actress, played by Blake Lively, is on her way to a remote beach she had never been, but always dreamed of going to. Within the first couple minutes of the film, you're on the beach. There are very few actors in this movie, and so the story and what is going on is easy to follow. As far as a perfect ""arc"" goes, The Shallows takes you for a hell of a ride, from the first shot, to the last. I was scared. I knew the whole time what was initially going to happen, but not how it was going to happen (I'm sorry, if you didn't know already, this film is based on a shark attack(s)). It was riveting, suspenseful, and man, I've got to admit, Blake Lively was hot. If the storyline, music, and scenery wasn't already enough, you've got 90 minutes to watch this actress shine. And I mean shine.Though I love any film shot on a beach, and had a feeling I was going to like this movie, I am still slightly shocked as to how good The Shallows is. A simple storyline, with minimal to no graphics (Other than the shark scenes), this movie feels real. Nothing to distract you, other than Blake Lively, but she brings you right into the story. And the closer to the story you get, the scarier it is when the shark is lurking. Don't kid yourself, this beautifully shot shark attack movie has got it all. And though the sun is shimmering most of the time, it is a horror flick. So be prepared to jump. I am seriously not sure how much I want to surf again. I've already had a couple fears while in the water hanging onto my board, but this is to a whole new level. That being said, I was inspired at the end of the film, and will get back in that water again. Not to mention, Rob Stewarts documentary, Sharkwater. If you've been scared of sharks because of the media and movies like The Shallows, watch Sharkwater. It will change your view of sharks and you won't be scared of these beautiful creatures in everyday real ocean life.Go see The Shallows. See it in theatres. The Big Screen really allows the shark scenes to jump out at you, the music rumbles in the theatre, and Blake Lively gives a great performance. Awesome movie, great horror flick, and yet still makes you want to go to a remote beach. But maybe not jump into the water. . .Soundtrack Review: Original Music by: Marco BeltramiThere was nothing spectacular about the soundtrack, but it certainly played to the scenes very well. The composer created fear, love and every other emotion you were meant to hear and feel, perfectly. I would not buy this soundtrack to listen to for fun, but it melded with the story and movie fantastically. Overall great soundtrack for The Shallows.",The Shallows

We're told she made it quite a ways through med school before taking break for a while. Med school is incredibly difficult and if someone gets in and makes it most of the way through and takes a break voluntarily, they are most certainly are not stupid.First stupid thing...the movie opens with her driving in a remote area of Mexico on a desolate road in an old truck alone with middle aged Mexican man she just met. How many intelligent mid 20's attractive American women are going to hop in a truck, by themselves, to reach a remote hidden beach that a strange man in a beat up truck who claims to know where it is? Any women with a half a brain isn't going to do that, let alone one smart enough to be in med school.It just goes on from there with bad decision after bad decision. How about this one, you see a huge dead floating whale, what do you do? We'll our character, a very experienced surfer, decides to swim up to it. No one with a reasonable amount of experience in the ocean is going to swim up to a dead whale carcass. Bad, bad, idea.It just goes on from there.The CGI action sequences were reasonably well done, yes you could tell it was CGI, but it was okay at least.

So my review is for those who share this strange obsession!I really enjoyed this film - and by enjoyed I mean it really did what a good shark movie should. Have you sitting there covering your eyes moaning ""no no no, I can't look"". And yet at the same time make it less drawn out than many do which was refreshing and all the more engaging. Some other positives: -Beautiful setting -Not nearly as cheesy as most shark movies -Decent lead acting and focusing on her as a human being rather than as a sex object which is unusual and refreshing. (By this I mean Blake is a beautiful young woman, but there was a minimal amount of sexual emphasis on this beyond the obligatory bikini boob shot at the start.) I REALLY found this great and such a big step forward! It sets the tone of the movie at a far higher bar than the usual flesh feast shark movies do (HAR HAR) and helps make the whole thing much more believable and serious. -It's scary, did I mention this?! -It felt pretty original as far as shark movies go, with a smart female protagonist and a simple storyOkay so the only bad thing and the reason it wasn't a 10/10 for me: -Just to unrealistic - I don't want to spoil things so I won't go into detail but I feel the story went just a bit too far in the shark's actions. If it had kept to erring on the side of realism it would have been all the more thrilling and in the end make the difference between a shark movie vs. a psychological thriller that isn't in any form unbelievable or silly.Ultimately though I'd 100% recommend this film to any shark movie nut. And to those who aren't, it's worth giving it a go as it's a cut above the rest.",The Shallows
463,bmyers22,I was with you until the shark turned into a stalker,3,16 January 2017,"This movie started out well. A very attractive woman surfing on a beautiful, secluded beach. There was some great cinematography and shots of the area. Blake Lively even seems to be a decent actress.Then the shark stuff starts, and from the very beginning, we have to forget about everything we know about sharks and play pretend. First of all, she really ticks off the shark somehow by disturbing its ""feeding grounds."" She approaches a dead whale that the shark was feeding on and seems to have offended the shark somehow. So the shark ignores the thousands of pounds of floating, dead meat in the water for the rest of the movie, and pursues the 100 pound surfer girl exclusively.The surfer seeks refuge on the carcass of the whale, then the shark drags a dead whale many times its size further out into the ocean, and seems hell bent on knocking her off. In her escape from the floating whale to a small rock outcropping, she's bitten by the shark, and has some serious wounds from both the bite and coral. The shark is circling her, she's bleeding heavily, and there's no one around who can help.At this point, I'm still willing to forgive the whole shark ignoring the dead whale to pursue a person who isn't even in the water any more. It still felt suspenseful. I wanted her to find a way out and survive. The movie still had my interest and I still cared what happened to her.Then things got real, real stupid. The shark continued to circle, and killed a drunk on the beach who was trying to reach her. Then it killed two other surfers that she'd met the day before. It tried jumping up on the coral to reach her, and pretty much completely stopped acting like a shark. She managed to escape to a buoy as the tide came in, and the shark proceeded to rip the giant, steel buoy to pieces. She shoots the shark with a flare gun then lights whale oil in the water on fire with it, also lighting the shark on fire. I had already written off the movie at this point, but kept watching as I was already close to the end.She then ties herself to the anchor that was holding the buoy in place, and as the shark breaks the chains away she is pulled hundreds of feet under water in the matter of a couple of seconds, and the shark chases her at full speed with reckless abandon to kill her. It ends up impaling itself on the jagged spikes which were apparently part of the anchor.And yea, that was it. A stranded, wounded surfer with nothing kills an over 20 foot long shark by making it chase her into spikes. Dumb.You know what would have been good? A wounded surfer on a small rock outcropping tries to keep her sanity and get help to survive a shark attack. Leave out the dead whale because that kind of made the rest of the movie not make sense. Don't make a wounded, half dead surfer kill a 20+ foot shark, that's not the victory that the movie needed. It would have been sufficient to have her survive. You don't have to schlock it up with the typical Hollywood type ending.Sharks are scary enough, you don't have to make it cartoonish shark with a vendetta against a surfer. Every time the shark did something stupid that a shark would never do, it became less suspenseful. I don't know why they went down that road, but they turned a movie that started out pretty suspenseful into a SciFi Channel made for TV special with a dumb ending.",The Shallows
464,fujijord,Best since Jaws but won't carry it's weight through time like Jaws.,7,28 June 2016,"Suspenseful? yes, Does Blake look good? yes. *Spoiler* Does Steven ""SEAGAL"" makes it out alive? HECK YES!!! My favorite part. Him Surviving made it all worthwhile. :POn other notes, I was a little nit picky on a small thing. (Makes me sound like a tight ass, I know. But it crosses my mind and I wonder.) I don't really understand the water levels. (I'm not talking high and low tides . I get that) During the film I get a little thrown off on the depth of the water. One time I feel its super shallow, and the another deep in a similar spot. I understand that there could be sand banks an rocks, but sometimes feel Blake's in shallow-sh water and we get a below shot in the water that perceives to be a lot deeper. I'm not a surfer. So I can't complain. Fun movie though. Are you likely to forget it when a new highly anticipated blockbuster comes out? Probably. Will you still remember Jaws? Yes. Do you hate me answering for you? Probably So... If So.... Shark bite me.",The Shallows

And I will recommend it to those idiots if I want to mock someone ;) But, 99.9%, I am a well intentioned guy, so I place here my warning: it's a waste of time and don't make my mistake by watching it to the end of it.

I can set aside reality for an hour and a half for movies but give me a break. Typical Hollywood garbage for less intellectual folks. The shark death scene has to be one of the dumbest movie moments ever. Also, the cgi was created with a rotten potato. Blake Lively, Oscar Jaenada and Brett Cullen in a B... nah, C-movie. Avoid at all costs.Edit: Blake Lively in a bikini + the seagull are the reason I didn't give it a 1-sar.",The Shallows
467,kim-o-connor,Beyond stupid,1,28 July 2018,"The ""meat"" of this drama, if you will, starts with a 30(?) foot shark choosing the kicking, bony non-natural food item Blake Lively over a lifeless whale carcass that'd be much safer and nutritional to eat. It only goes downhill from there.The shark inexplicably circles an outcropping of rock inexhaustibly, trapping Lively and eschewing its natural inclination to roam the sea in search of prey. Maybe it's the vengeful, near-human obsession with eating this surfer. But for an ocean-going creature, it's oddly clumsy, bumping into nearly everything it comes near. It does manage to nip her on the leg but all's well - not only does the gash nearly instantaneously coagulate and close on its own, she manages to stitch it with a necklace she's been wearing.Meanwhile, Lively manages to stave off her life-threatening hunger after ONE DAY by munching on live crabs and makes a friend of a seagull who - after she fixes its dislocated wing - stays by her side in a show of seeming solidarity. Think Little Mermaid. Several people come to her aid, all to be eaten in gruesome ways because she belongs to the shark, damn it.Inexplicably, Lively decides her salvation lies in reaching the buoy 30 yards further out to sea and makes it by swimming through a neon forest of jellyfish, which she instinctively knows the shark will dislike. Once on the buoy, she unlocks the flare gun box (c'mon, we all know ancient buoys have flare gun boxes) but fails to flag down a passing ship.But all is not lost. Because there's apparently no current in the Pacific ocean, the oil slick leading from the buoy to the dead whale (which the shark has ignored for two days running) is intact and immediately catches fire when a flare is fired into it. This burns the shark but succeeds only in making it angrier. It follows Lively as she sinks impossibly fast to a trench in the ocean ell ahead of the shark, who nonetheless is on her heels. But alas, our clumsy aggressor impales itself on the remnants of the metal buoy it only moments before ripped apart. Lively is washed ashore and rescued by a boy and his father only live to surf another day.Seriously.",The Shallows
468,kishankalariya01,The Shallows- Black Lively,9,25 September 2016,"This new American classic film on survival from attack of shark will keep your adrenaline flowing till the end of movie. This movie pits a young woman's desire to live against a shark's desire to eat. A mere 200 yards from shore, her short journey to safety becoming the ultimate contest of wills.On one of sunny day she went to beach of Brazil for surfing, little she know that just 200 yards from shore a shark is waiting to kill her. While she been undone on aquatic hover board by shark she quickly reaches in no time on a dead whale to protect herself from deadly shark. Again when been attacked on whale she reaches just in time on big rock for shelter. She is just 200 yards from shore seems very near yet very far. It keep promising hope yet impossible to reach when a shark is wandering around in some particular pattern. Finally she decides to fight against death and makes a master plan to kill shark. The way she executes it on a middle of water where her enemy is one who is in control is magnificent to watch. Despite being injured, she knows her limitation and carefully fight between life and death. Between all these drama audience gets beautiful moments, black lively really takes us to a new level of feeling from where we can take a lesson or two for a life.",The Shallows
469,ddmagic38,The Shallows lacks real depth,5,29 June 2016,"The Shallows is a mixed bag of entertainment. At times it feels like your on the cusp of entering the Syfy movie of the week with cheesy CGI and questionable acting and at other times you feel like your watching a genuine suspense thriller.The biggest reason for this back and forth is chiefly due to Directors Jaume Collet-Serra execution of the story. Overall the film is visually beautiful, but scenes tonally shift from one shot to the next. In the first half of the film the shark is seen only in shadows or in a quick cut, and that builds up a lot tension and dread. Yet as we move into the 2nd and 3rd acts; too much of the shark is seen and you begin to lose the suspense because the shark is now literally front and center. Your attention now turns to how the CGI shark looks instead. There are some interesting visual choices on how the characters communicate with each by phone, but it does feel a bit gimmicky.The story is the familiar man (or this case woman) vs nature scenario which is a solid foundation to build a film, but on occasion the plot tends to veer into some questionable Syfy movie of the week territory like finding safety on top of a dead whale :) Blake Lively does a fair job of playing a woman at a crossroads in her life. A subplot involving her relationship with her family is only so-so, where she really shines is are the scenes where she is trapped on this tiny exposed reef. On her own and wounded, isolated by a great white circling around the reef just waiting. You feel Blake's pain, stress, fear, and eventual will to survive all taking place on this one spot. Before and after this though Blake's performance doesn't really stand out.Last but not least is arguably the star of the film, the CGI shark. In short it's not great (no pun intended)and as we move into the final confrontation, between human and shark, the CGI really is at it's worse. CGI shot of Blake's face on an actual surfer is also iffy.The film again has some genuine thrills but not a lot and it's not excessively gory. Also even though the film is just under 90 minutes, it does still feel a little long.I give it 5 stars out of 10",The Shallows
470,jayseepillay,"Realities of ""Paradisio""",8,26 August 2021,"Storyline is masterfully acheived through a resilient performance from Lively.

471,adam_skelton,Finish her!,1,30 July 2019,Atrocious from start to finish - the character wasn't someone many could connect with nor feel any sympathy for.

472,mirovy22,Good on many levels,7,7 June 2018,"I didn't have high expectations for The Shallows. I simply hoped it would be as tense as Open Water. It didn't quite live up to the latter, but don't dismiss this film as just a run-of-the-mill thriller. It's actually quite a lot better than that.Blake Lively plays our strong, brave, and resourceful heroine, Nancy, an excellent surfer. If I were rating her rather than the film, she'd get a 9.0. Her performance was really admirable, especially when one considers that, just like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, she has to carry 95% of the movie (but more about that later...)The plot is straightforward: while at a beach whose very name is vigorously protected by the locals (to discourage hoards of tourists finding and despoiling their little sandy paradise), Nancy is attacked by a great white shark while surfing.She is more or less trapped on a small rock that will be covered in water by high tide. Now we've got our ticking clock. Not only does she have to stay alive by attending to her shark bite and the elements, but she has to figure a way off the rock before it's too late.Providing more plot details won't enhance your enjoyment of the movie, so that's all I'll mention on the subject.The last scenes of Nancy vs. the shark strain credulity, but we don't care. This is a movie where we simply root for Nancy to survive. I won't say if she does or not. However, despite the overboard girl versus shark climax, I actually came away with a high regard for the film because it did something jaded movie goers don't expect: it impressed me.How did it impress me? The action scenes are so well done that we are drawn into them, rather than passively watching and checking the time on my watch. Once the movie concluded, a few thoughts passed through my mind: how did they film such amazing shark sequences? It has to be a mechanical shark, but it sure looks real. Yeah, they go overboard with it being a super-shark (but still... it's name is the GREAT White Shark!), but that must have been visually stunning in an actual movie theatre (regrettably I saw this as a Netflix movie, on a television screen).I started wondering how they could make the movie look so flawless. They take good advantage of the scenery, the shark, and they keep us totally invested in Nancy's outcome. That's tough to do when she's stuck on a rock for long stretches, but they pull it off nicely.They say a movie is a collaborative effort, and this certainly proves it. Good acting, an amazing director: Jaume Collet-Serra, enviable cinematography, and smart editing keeps us interested.So is this a movie for the ages that you'll be raving about in 20 years. Nope, but it's also doubtful that you'll be bored watching it, which is somewhat of a rarity nowadays, unless your watching some $250 million Marvel comics movie.If you want a pleasant (gripping!) one hour and twenty-six minutes, and liked Open Water, then this is the movie for you.",The Shallows

She decides to visit a secluded beach in Mexico, somewhere her Mother apparently used to visit. After a few hours of surfing with two guys she meets at the beach, the men go back to shore and get ready to go home, leaving Blake Lively alone at sea on her surf board. Before she knows it a shark appears and drags her under water, causing a big gash in Blakes leg. Luckily enough she breaks free and swims to the safety of a nearby badly injured whale, floating out to sea. Holding on to the poor whales fleshy wounds for dear life, she cries out for help hoping the two men would hear her and get help, but sadly for Blake they didn't hear her screams... I won't say anymore about the plot, as that is basically all that's to tell. Yeah their are some deaths along the way, however nothing memorable, as you don't really get to see a second of what's happening, and their wasn't really any character build up to these unfortunate victims, so you don't really care for their demise, although that said, it's still upsetting knowing someone is being eaten by a shark. I refer to the character as Blake Lively, instead of the name of the woman she was playing, because I have no idea what her name was, it was pointed out once or twice I think, but I must not have been paying enough attention. I want to say Rachel, but I also want to say Zoe...Anyway, for the most part of 90 minutes we sit and watch Blake lively have conversations with herself. When shes not talking to herself shes making terrible decisions, or having conversations with a seagull I've named Paul. Paul's really nice, we root for Paul! When you finally get some good close ups of Mr Shark, it leaves you wanting to scream, ""WHAT THE HELL, THIS STUFF WAS BETTER IN THE 70's!"". The shoddy CGI leaves you feeling as if you are watching a really horrific scene in finding Dory, as the clearly visual affects take you right out of the realness of the made up scenario. As sudden as the film began, the film ends with a miracle fire on water and some very well placed spikes, all just to remind you that yes, another rushed, not very well thought out Hollywood movie, has just taken up another 90 minutes of your life. All criticism aside.

And I find it a bit far fetched that there was a dead whale to eat and it decided to hang around for a boney Blake lively, not to mention the other few people the shark ate. Just a lot more could have been done to make this a more interesting movie.The graphics of the shark was realistic when you saw it, so I give a thumbs up for that. It definitely was the most realistic looking shark out of any shark movies ever made. But the first Jaws movie had a really good story line and that's why I still rate jaws over this movie!I gave this movie 3 stars because 6.6 is not an accurate rating and those that have put 10 out of 10...

489,Robot_Fireman,"Functional, yet underwhelming shark thriller",4,17 August 2016,"""The Shallows"" lured me in with a trailer that does no more than tensely establishing the setup of the film (instead of spoiling every major twist). I was hoping for a clear-cut, slow-burning thriller that plays out in a minimalist yet effective way. What I got was a film that works in principle and is structured rather well, but whose aesthetics and themes are way too blatant.There are surf scenes in a staccato of slow and fast motion, spiced up with soft-techno music, just to hammer home the fact that surfing is supposed to be 'cool'. The character arc of Nancy (Balke Livley) is simple to understand, yet the movie has to remind the audience at least three times quite obviously what its about. And even though the main protagonist looks sexy enough in her bikini and her skintight suit, the camera-work has to stress the curves of her body as to make sure that even the last male and lesbian tongue is lolling. (I have nothing against that, but after a time, the emphasized sexiness felt a little distracting). It seems this movie was made by Captain Obvious, but to my surprise, it was the director of ""Non-Stop"", ""Unknown"" and ""Run all Night"". Subtlety is not a language that ""The Shallows"" speaks. For me, these elements of the film didn't work that well, but they aren't terrible either.Apart from that, the film can be enjoyed as a nice little B-Picture. Some of the underwater and panorama shots look gorgeous, as does the location on which the movie was filmed. However, the camera work in the beginning is somewhat terrible; the faces of the actors feel too close and the scenes on the beach are more shaky than the scenes in the water. The Film manages to build some nice tension in the middle part and Nancy is quite resourceful and intelligent in her ways to deal with the shark. However, the movie wastes some potential in the finale that is just full of weird coincidences and unbelievable animal behavior.I enjoyed ""The Shallows"" for what it was and would recommend it to people who like the premise. It definitely has its strengths, but from the aesthetic choices and the way the film talks to its audience, it's clear that it was made with a teenage viewership in mind. And that's fine! However, I didn't enjoy these design decisions as much.",The Shallows

I would have preferred some tear pretend less and some body torn to pieces in more (I'm not cynical, but I did not expect the tears). Removing the dramatic parts, the film has what must have and entertains well despite a few platitudes jump out occasionally.

Brings nothing new to the table except by being completely ridiculous.SPOILER ALERT First of all, no need to be a shark's expert to know that this movie is completely out of the picture. Great White Sharks never take thing personally, they are predators, not some stalker who play with their victims and chase them for hours.Second (and it was mention on the board). The shark of the movie can easily kill and even cut in half a man but didn't nothing but a ridiculous wound on the leg of a woman ? Once you reach this part of the movie, you know that it's all about the cute Nancy and the producers probably didn't want her to be to messed up.The movie wasn't bad because of the acting or anything else. It is bad because it tries to look realistic but the way the shark is described as a psycho killer who don't want to let Nancy go and our dear little surfer who become expert swimmer/survivalist and able to trick the shark at the end is way beyond anything I can believe.Could have been an OK film but fall on all the trap possible, making it a bad movie with a bad plot and nothing that will make you happy to have seen this movie. Just another stupid ammunition for the dumb people who thinks Sharks need to be eradicate.",The Shallows

Everything up until the climax was credible, and totally involving. But did she really push that buoy into the shark's mouth and it didn't swerve to avoid it? and why did her rescuer leave her lying face up on the beach when she needed to expel the water in her lungs? Nonetheless, my heart and my stomach had a roller-coaster ride along with Blake Lively's 'Nancy'.",The Shallows
493,cinematic8,Not a typical shark movie,8,30 September 2016,"I didn't have much expectations from this one, yet I was surprised. most of the shark movies I've watched were basically full of blood and ripped organs. The Shallows also have them, but it is not too disgusting. some scenes are hard to watch for those who are sensitive. but mainly, this movie is about fighting. its about fighting your fears, your own sense of desperation and find a place for hope to fill in. I'm not ashamed to say this movie motivated me. Blake lively is good and passes off the character's feelings to the viewer. another reason to watch this movie is the beautiful ocean and beaches. I recommend this movie for those who like survival films.",The Shallows
494,scotteydog,Mainly entertained for 83 minutes,7,29 November 2016,"The beginning had me thinking, oh no not another undernourished bikini clad actress. As for the shark & action scenes, I thought it was OK for a 17 million dollar budget. And I loved the cinematography & location (only finding out that it was Lord Howe Island after watching the Blu ray extra's) & what a beautiful beach it is. And hey, people bang on about realism in film but really, its an American action, horror, thriller film. Do people really have to tear apart a script that after all, it is there actually to entertain us, not give us a thesis on accurate shark behavior etc. And I didn't no Blake Lively before this film, but apparently she worked hard to get fit for the role & did some of her own stunts. For 83 Min's I was mostly satisfied & entertained. And I don't mind people bagging films like 'Prometheus' because of the over-inflated budget & previous success, so you would naturally expect more. This film has grossed 117 million dollars from a 17 million dollar budget, so obviously deserves credit.",The Shallows

Lively's character is stranded on a small island with an injured seagull,after being attacked by a killer shark, and has to make it to the shore line before the tide comes in.

This loss made her wonder about her life as medical student and she decided to take a break and went to the beach her mother once visited when she was pregnant. As far as we go to the character, seems that Nancy would give up her career in medical faculty as she says to her father ""Why try so hard if the results are the same?"". Might be because of the pain and suffering from the chemotherapy worsens her quality of life. Nancy might thought that if her mother would die anyway, why don't just take the palliative care, more fight means more suffering.Things change when the shark hit her. She know she wants to life, she wants to meet her family again. Suddenly fighting is not just for yourselt, but for the people you loved.Blaked Lively acted well and we can feel her determinated will to survive, not just in this shark attack but in her live afterhat.",The Shallows

505,kksrcurran,"Good popcorn movie, not great",5,27 June 2016,"This is the type of movie that requires that you cannot judge it in the realm of realism. I thought the movie did a great job making you feel uncomfortable with some of the physical horror, it had good surprise scenes that made the audience scream and it did a good job making you feel for Blake Lively's character (Nancy) and hope to see her find a way to shore. To be safe, I'd warn that the rest includes SPOILERS as it touches on aspects of the movie that were not completely shown in trailers. The things I didn't love about the movie included:* Effort to allow for dialog with Nancy talking to herself as a patient was a bit contrived. Not horrible but not great. *I am not a marine biologist by any means but I find it hard to believe that any shark would be drawn away from a whale carcass by a few surfers. At some point the shark would get full and no longer chase prey. The attempt to give the shark a reason to hate humans because of the embedded hook fell short in my opinion. *Again, as a non-marine-biologist, I found it extremely hard to believe that a whale carcass that had been present for less than 24 hours would create enough of a blubber-slick to allow a flare to create a surface fire. *The hardest thing for me to accept was the way that she killed the shark. Maybe it's no more difficult to accept than Brody killing a shark with a giant power cord. But there is no way that that tiny chain would pull Nancy down to the sea floor faster than the animated shark could swim. It was fun to see shark death but I would have preferred to see her release the chain and slowly get closer to shore when the buoy was pushed in by the waves.All in all, I do not regret investing a few dollars and a couple hours to watch this. They kept it simple and it was generally compelling. That said, if I see this movie playing on TV in the future, I will not be drawn in to watch it again.",The Shallows

507,saanaa,Excellent Thriller,9,11 September 2016,"The movie features great filming location and good camera work. The main star is Blake Lively which apart of being quite hot, showed exceptional acting skills and made a believable character. The plot reminded me a lot of Cujo (1983). As any other 'shark movie', it bring a lot unneeded controversy about not being realistic as ""a shark would never do that"". Well, it's not a shark documentary, it's a fantasy survival story. And it got it all horror, suspense, drama in a neat package that entertain and deliver the whole time. My great admiration to the director Jaume Collet-Serra. I recommend the title and would watch it again.",The Shallows
508,A_Kind_Of_Peace,The bird was the most interesting character,2,19 August 2018,"I watched this because my flatmate had it on and I became intrigued as to how this woman was going to get away from the shark, because it was blatantly obvious she wasn't going to die, so I sat there and watched it all. Turns out I shouldn't have bothered. What tosh!
A woman goes surfing and gets attacked by a shark, she then ends up on a rock and with high tide approaching she has to figure out a way to get off her little rock and back to safety.
The biggest thing that annoyed me was continuity, or lack of. One minute she looks severely dehydrated but then in the next shot she looks absolutely fine... oh, wait... she's dehydrated again! This happens continuously throughout. Another annoyance, which other reviewers have mentioned, is her super human strength! She has a huge gash on her leg and was losing a lot of blood, she had multiple cuts and grazes, gangrene on the gashed leg, several smacks in the arms, legs, face, no water, no food, and no sun lotion!! Yet somehow none of this seemed to affect her and she could still swim (faster than a shark I might add) climb, kick, and flail her arms about at anyone she saw on the shore. Now if that were any normal human being we'd be passed out from blood loss and exhausted from having had no food, water and too much sun!
Overall I really bad movie that wasn't scary, suspended disbelief and continuity errors throughout.
The only redeeming feature was the bird who kept her company.",The Shallows
509,MPlewes83,After all the hype....,6,8 September 2016,"I watched The Shallows last night, and I was actually quite excited to do that after all the hype it had been receiving and people I know were also mentioning similar good things. Well I can't say they were right and I can't say they were wrong. This movie is a mixed bag and I was watching it with the mindset that people tend to build up movies so much that when you actually do see it, it's underwhelming. I felt that this movie could be one of those cases, so I tried to keep my expectations slightly low.I'll start with what I liked: I thought the set up was kind of interesting, how to keep a wounded woman stuck out in the ocean with land in sight and a shark on her scent, I liked the beginning is the end kind of thing they start with and I liked the fact that there wasn't just a whole bunch of young people around to be shark food. The tension was built up pretty good and had some great moments, but I never truly felt like she (Blake Lively) was in real danger because she is the lead actor. Her performance was very well done for what she was working with, and what straight man wouldn't enjoy seeing her in a very small bikini for 90 minutes. The were a few cool scenes and a scenario with the shark in a wave but there were so many missed opportunities to build up more suspense by having things like that happen more because the shark really doesn't do much.Now to the things I didn't really like: Well I could have done without the tacked on dance tunes and party music that is geared toward the target viewing audience but it took me out of the movie a little. I felt if they left that but took out all the other lame ""this is hip now"" music they could have a good score that would have added to building the suspense. The other things I didn't like was that the bite on her leg should have been more devastating from a shark that size but I was willing to let that go for the sake of the movie to continue. Also I would have liked to see more overhead shots of the shark circling or just lingering around in the clear water, which would build even more suspense as I found it to be effective. I also feel like the shark might have given up after hours of inactivity, I know they can smell blood from a mile away but come on, so as she puts her foot in the water and basically it's right there? And the whole ending was OK the way she gets the shark was different and creative but it seemed like everything up until he got onto that buoy turned into one of the most ridiculous series of events for a movie that took itself fairly serious throughout up until that. In summary, The Shallows in an enjoyable film, being aimed at people around the ages of 13-25 I imagine. But as a 33 year old man, I was only slightly impressed by the setup and the first shark encounter but anything after than I felt it went off back into familiar ""shark movie"" territory. The final act is just brimming with events way too far out of the realm of belief for me, regarding what the shark was doing was so unbelievable that it almost ruined the movie for me. *OVERALL I GIVE THE SHALLOWS A 6/10*",The Shallows

Solid acting, beautiful area and at least a modicum of shark fact to go with the wtf moments.Some of the facts that I see people complaining about actually make me cringe. I would love to see more movies like this. It was nothing like Jaws but seemed a bit more akin to The Reef.Whales bring in sharks, which lends credence to the appearance of a great white in a supposedly ""no shark"" area. The water lighting on fire made sense to me and...frankly using that chain to get to the anchor at the bottom? I wouldn't have had the guts.What I did NOT like, however, was the behavior of the shark itself. The single- minded Rogue mentality that has been debunked by the community of marine biology. Staying in one area for a long time makes sense with the whale carcass being present...but going after the humans like that? Of course it didn't eat them but then again...willing suspension of disbelief in those type of moments.The movie was worth the time to watch and I enjoyed it.I warn everyone to please keep an open mind for some of the glaringly obvious moments of disbelief in the film.",The Shallows

A bit unrealistic, yes.. but nonetheless, full of suspense and a nice little time kill.**SPOILERS FROM HERE** As i mentioned there is suspense in this movie, i didn't know whether she was going to make it off that rock or survive after (yes, i assumed she was going to live, not many movies have dark endings...). And that is a plus for this movie... However there were quite a few things i disliked... Her unbelievable endurance and strength despite the fact she lost a ton of blood due to the shark bite, multiple scratches and hits and a whole day of swimming... Sharks determination to eat one particular target even though it had a whole whale carcass just a few meters away alongside 3 people it ate during that period. I may be wrong, but i believe only a hungry animal would stalk one pray for so long, and this one had plenty to eat..I had mixed feeling throughout this movie... It started of nice, then the shark went into berserk mode, killing everybody just because it can... at that point i started hating it a little bit. Then, struggle to live and little bit of action kicked in to save this movie.Overall, i don't regret watching this move. It has it's ups and downs, but nevertheless a nice movie.6/10",The Shallows
518,bhagen1982,I know its for suspense but c'mon,7,4 July 2016,"So I really like the previews for this movie, and was really excited to see this movie. But the director made this Great White way to aggressive. Up until we see Nancy's intentional and very scary attach was really liking the movie. After that the shark started to become fake. 1) True Whites will stick around area's wear there is food, and that whale carcass will provide food for days, but the shark will typically stick with that blubber for days, not bothering with drunks, or surfers. 2) Because of the whale carcass, the white will NOT put its self in jeopardy for food. The shark is scene doing this multiple times (almost beaching his self in the coral and eating the damn bu-wee)3) Whites in Mexico have not been known to breach this behavior has only been seen in South Africa. 4) Yes, the way this white has attacked its pry it could easily kill a human, but when a white attacks the first bit is known as an exploratory bit and 99.9% of the time when it bits a human it spits it out. So with that being said yes Nancy was 200 yards off shore, yes the first attack would of been horrible but what how that would of really gone is shark attacks Nancy, Nancy comes to the surface terrified, Nancy goes slowly gets herself safely back to shore the white shark goes back to eating his blubber rich whale carcass.

520,Rattaplan,Unrealistic piece of wtf!,3,29 July 2016,"I wanted to like this but.. This is one of the most ridiculous movies I've seen in a while. Left me baffled in disbelief. The protagonist is apparently Wonder Woman, or something, since she doesn't need any food or drink to survive for days. Neither does she seem to feel much pain or any side effects from gaping wounds, gangrene, and jellyfish stings, nor bleed to death from blood constantly gushing out of her wounds. In fact, after two nights, in this emergency state, she still has the strength and stamina of an Olympic athlete.The shark is similarly unrealistic in that it can apparently stalk people, eat an entire person within seconds before immediately moving to the next one, and rather circles a potential human prey rather than eating from a juicy whale cadaver nearby.You're better off watching something like ""Sharknado"" I'm afraid.",The Shallows

With all the knowledge we now have of shark behavior through research over the decades since jaws was released, you just can't get away with making something that completely goes against everything we know.jaws was a masterpiece and still stands the tests of time so to see people comparing it to this movie, it baffles me. The idea of suspense seems to be lost on filmmakers these days, especially when it comes to shark movies. Less is more, the most unsettling thing about jaws was the fact you didn't see the shark for the majority of the movie whilst in ""The Shallows"" you see far too much to the point nothing can shock you.All in all, if you're thinking of watching this movie,don't. It's not worth the time",The Shallows
523,undinian,Great performance from Blake Lively against a terrifying shark!,8,20 July 2016,"The Shallows was delightfully scary and riveting throughout the entire film. A few flaws I find that plague a lot of survival films have to do with that they are often quite long, and when there is a character in solitude, the lack of interaction with others can sometimes make a film boring or slow. This is not the case whatsoever in The Shallows which keeps the film a touch under an hour and a half. The entire point of survival films is well, that the protagonist survives, but despite that I was completely and utterly on edge during the vast majority of the movie. The race against time with the rising tide built up perfect tension, and I found the shark to be absolutely frightening! The concept of the story itself was original as well.I've been a fan of Blake Lively since she was on Gossip Girl and I think she has come a long way as an actress. Previously I thought she was good as the charismatic Serena van der Woodsen, but The Shallows is what really showcases her talent as Nancy. Even though she plays a similar charismatic fun-in-the-sun character, this time she is pretty much on her own as she acts almost entirely on her own throughout the entire movie opposite a CGI shark. That must have been quite challenging for her as an actress, and her performance was flawless. Dialogue was limited, but her range in expressions and emotions were certainly not lacking in the least.Nancy was an extremely clever character who repeatedly uses her wits in a setting that she otherwise would have had no experience with. She's a medical student who is able to apply her knowledge to help her survive a serious wound from a shark bite. This little bit of background knowledge helped round her character in a way that made sense.*****SPOILERS***** Although I think I would have enjoyed this film regardless of whether a man or a woman played the protagonist, that this was a female protagonist was just a little bit of a plus for me. As someone who has studied acting, I really appreciate it when films make some great roles for women. One thing I especially liked about Nancy as a character was that I really thought that someone else would save her in the movie. At any moment I was expecting a rescue helicopter to come save her, a pod of dolphins to come beat up the shark, anything. Instead she manages to outwit the shark and save herself.Although this is not the moment that kills the shark, my absolute favourite scene in the movie was when Nancy shoots a flare gun around the water of the dead whale and the shark is on fire for a brief moment. While the shark on fire was was quite a spectacular vision to behold and a truly great bit of CGI work, again I love how this showed that Nancy was truly a clever character for thinking about the oil that would have been coming from the whale.The only real issue I had was at the end when Nancy still has both legs. I really expected her to have lost the limb that was bitten. It was not a huge issue that this did not happen, but it would have made the ending just a little more powerful.I otherwise heavily recommend this movie, especially to fans of Jaws. I saw this with my boyfriend because Jaws is his favourite movie, and he really enjoyed it as well. As a summer flick it was a great thriller and I would definitely enjoy watching it again. I definitely plan to add it to my movie collection.",The Shallows

Fact: sharks don't like human flesh and blood. Shark going at the buoy... Seriously!!! The buoy fall on its side when one of the chain is cut!!! This doesn't happen.

526,sedwardsproductions,when you cant see the danger...,7,4 July 2016,"I went into this films with low expectations but I was pleasantly surprised.I felt this on screen movie was better than the script which included a back story of Nancy's late mother. The movie touched on this but it wasn't littered with references like the script was. The movie flowed much better due to this.What ""The Shallows"" also got right was the reveal of the villain.The subtle references of what lurks beneath leads to a refreshing reveal - in which I must say is the best CGI incarnation there has been of a shark. Also, the shark, as the antagonist was directly set against the protagonist (Nancy). Again, rather than the usual mindless eating machine. But what the director got right most of all was the tension... no score - just the sound of the water. You are right with Nancy through all of her struggles and victories. No cut to ""where's Nancy?"" scenes showing bumbling friends etc.... Again, a refreshing change.The only thing which a found a moot point was the mystery of the location. It's referenced several times ""what's this place called?"" but you never find out, which kinds of defeats the object of it being referenced so many times throughout.You can tell the producers wanted a couple of ""hollywood"" moments in there which don't fit the tone of the story, but apart from that The Shallows is a fun film and definitely worth a watch.",The Shallows

Without a lot of script and characters, this film has successfully and poignantly portrayed the beauty of an island, a no-name island, with a shark lurking in the shallows. Every bit of the soundtrack seamlessly illustrates the motion picture. It is definitely a must to see it on the silver screen if you're a big fan of, first, Blake Lively; second, sharks; and survival of the fittest.",The Shallows

529,icedm,This shark is missing teeth !,6,18 August 2016,"On the good side cgi and special effects are well made and some of the images of the beach and the ocean are stunning. The acting is good giving a sense of immersion and overall the viewer definitely experiences the terror inflicted by the shark on the protagonist. The movie is a good survival story and i would recommend watching it. But i don't think it's a must see in a theater. You can totally watch it home and this is why:When i took a look at the budget before seeing the movie i knew they couldn't allow themselves to integrate too much action scenes including cgi. To counter this, they needed a very good script. This is where the movie falls short of expectations in my opinion. The story is much too simple to be the sole plot of an entire movie. To counter that a lot of emphasis is placed on the emotional side of the story. At some points it gets a little boring, you have the feeling that those simplistic scenes (budget wise) were thrown in solely to enable a minimal duration of 1 hour and a half long for the movie. I was therefore a bit disappointed and still hungering for more since not much is happening unfortunately, even with a quite short movie. But still i recommend watching it at home it's worth your time.",The Shallows
530,bnladwig,Ridiculous ending,1,16 October 2016,"The idea is decent, the initial execution is adequate and suspenseful, but the ending is sheer stupidity. The kind that ruins the movie. This is a good example of someone having a good idea but then having absolutely no idea about how to end the film. Whoever approved this ending at the studio (Columbia Pictures) should be ashamed of themselves -- but they're probably too busy counting the dollars as this film was, unfortunately, a commercial success. I'm inclined to write the studio to get back my $3 for the rental, as it wasn't even worth that. In fact, perhaps I should ask to be paid for the two hours that I wasted watching the film. Tons of other shark movies are way more satisfying than this one. And that includes Jaws IV.",The Shallows

Feel sorry for Blake.",3,9 September 2018,"What a shame, I was looking forward to this movie, mainly thanks to Blake, I really like her, I think she has got a talent, havent expected anything special from the movie though, just to enjoy and relax watching nice set and great white shark. But boy, I am sorry but what a bunch of ignorants is behind this? I really thought that the days people are presenting this amazing animal as a killing, ruthless beast behaving like psychopath are far over. Attacking from down below? Chasing the girl straight down? Like seriously? Are you even grown ups?Every 5yr old kid knows these are the moves sharks never do, never behaving like idiotic drug eddict. Where is the respect to this animal?Omg.And thats what really pi..ed me off. I understand that you cant make a nerve wracking movie with real great white, as it would be boring and impossible to create a drama, so thats only one solution to this. Stop making the movies with great white at last! It wont work! World doesnt need that! Not everybody in this world must be making movies! And Blake should be really carefull who she teams up with, it is a very thin line between being respected or being forever connected with films beyond rediculousness, this is one of them. Also at the end I wondered what happened to her friend who stayed in the hotel, not missing her friend at all for almost two days :)))). Guys, you give changing your career a really strong thought.",The Shallows
532,stephengontis,A Worthy Successor to 'Jaws',8,23 June 2016,"The Shallows is a perfect example of how to make a perfectly competent and thrilling shark movie from the moment the camera opens onto the beautiful Mexican beaches to the very end once the last of the credits has rolled. The cast (which is very small, good for this kind of movie) is led by a beautiful Blake Lively; none of the others are of particular significance. Lively stars as Texan medical student Nancy, who has determined it's time to take a little R & R and takes a trip to a idyllic Mexican coast. Before long, however, she becomes the victim of a shark attack and, alone, save for the company of a seagull, the movie is a harrowing tale of man, er, woman versus nature at its finest. Lively proves to be a great choice as the lead. She has a charisma, vulnerability, and resourcefulness that I believe is ideal in the heroines of this genre of film; bold and plucky, she manages to keep a smile on her face (much of the time), with an attitude that seems to say, ""gimme your best shot."" It is riveting to watch her scramble to stay alive, determined not to lose to what appears to be the very hand of Fate itself. This movie does what any shark movie that is worth its salt does best, that is, besides possessing a great number of fake-outs and an ominous, looming score, it contrasts the beauty of its surroundings with the horrors that lurk beneath. And the location is part of what makes this movie so very, very good. If it weren't for the shark, I'd want to dive right into those cool, blue waters. The cinematographer does a wonderful job of showing how indisputably beautiful the Mexican coasts are (and how unforgiving). The shark itself is a CGI spectacle, looking just like the real thing. And while it lacks the threatening presence of Jaws, it nevertheless makes for a wonderful foe for Lively. It is intelligent and *seems* to be gunning for Lively, its determination unsettling and beyond natural, dare I say, purposeful. And though there is one moment which I believe ""jumps the shark"" just a bit, it leads to one of the best, kick-ass endings I've seen in recent cinema. My only major complaint is that during some of the early surfing sequences, the action goes from slow to fast to slow again one-too-many times, and some of the beginning scenes linger a little too long. But these are easily forgettable, as the rest of the film's 87-minute run-time is unrelenting intensity from the point where the camera emerges from the murky depths in classic, Jaws-like fashion. THIS is the Jaws sequel we should've gotten. I *do* recommend wading into The Shallows.8/10",The Shallows
533,skifloh,2 Stars for the Bird,2,7 August 2016,"Blake Lively diving better than a shark, burning water, surfers that go surf without letting anybody know about spot and timing spoiled this movie but the bird was a solid 2 stars. Gotta love a good animal performance. Oh wait, he was animated? Right...On a serious note probably the worst movie I have seen this year. Some beautiful shots with solid acting but the storyboard is just ridiculous and details such as wrong light for different times in the day are frustrating. Not worth watching...unless you like watching a bird's wing getting fixed by a med-school dropout. *chirp-chirp*",The Shallows

But this is nothing more than a stain on her otherwise great resume. The movie has no substance. We don't even really care for any of the characters and we're not afraid of the shark. There is not a single ""eye-opener"", a ""i didn't see that coming"" or even a ""aah, that's why"". Spare yourself the utter disappointment of spending 80 minutes of your life to see a thrill-free, boring, unrealistic and completely ridiculous movie with no point what so ever and the most anti-climatic ending I've ever seen.",The Shallows
535,jduffandrade,A Short Thriller That Will Keep You On the Edge of Your Seat (SPOILERS),9,9 July 2016,"For my love and interest towards sharks, I was very much looking forward to this movie. Ever since the trailer was released I have been waiting desperately for the special date of June 24. So yes, I may be biased because it is a shark movie and about something I like, but in a seriousness, the Shallows is a good movie. Some may argue: ""Oh, a shark that size would never be able to jump out of the water in areas that shallow,"" or ""A shark would never stick around to make sure it consumes the last human in the area, and would not relentlessly continue to kill everyone that enters the water"". Yes most of these complaints and arguments may be true, but that is just to drive the plot, for if the shark went away, that would be the end of the movie and hundreds of unhappy moviegoers would leave the theater asking for a refund and saying, ""That wasn't exciting at all! She just disturbed the shark, waited on a rock for 2 days until the shark was gone and swam back to shore!""So without the great white's grudge for Blake Lively, who disturbed the shark's feeding grounds (A deceased 200 ton blue whale) there would be no movie, suspense, or action.Moving on, as for the movie, it was beautifully shot. The scenery was amazing, blue (it's an ocean of course), and colorful. The acting was laudable, for Blake Lively's performance was well crafted (It's very hard to act without talking much), and the other actors did fine as well.As for the shark, the CGI was overall very good, compared to other shark horror movies where the sharks are literally all animated as if they were in Pixar cartoons. Yes I'm talking about Deep Blue Sea. God, what an abomination of a movie. Anyways, a lot of effort was put in to creating the main antagonist, and for the most part, the shark was very believable, especially when it breached out of the water and attacked the two surfers, *shivers*.I only have three magical complaints for the entire movie, which unfortunately was 87 minutes long... eh I guess we'll add that as a complaint. The movie was too short for my taste. My first complaint was that I did not like when Ms. Lively was skyping her family and the screen of the phone was displayed like a hologram facing the audience. It was quite corny and found it to be light and unrealistic.My second complaint is that there was not enough exposition and the rising action and climax came too quickly. This would've made the movie longer, yes, and possibly more interesting. For instance, give some more backstory on how Ms. Lively lost her mother or if you don't want to extend the exposition, make other conflicts happen while she is stranded on the rock. Maybe a canoe can come across or a life raft and the shark eats it, I don't know! I am not a film writer!Finally, the ending! TOO PREDICTABLE! She kills the shark in the most insane way, although cool... COMPLETELY INSANE! She grabs a weighted chain, unhooks it from the buoy, and plummets down with a shark on her tail. Suddenly she releases the chain, after plummeting a hundred or so feet and the shark is impaled by the pole connected to the chain. Poor shark. What made me really want to see the movie was in one of the trailers, the announcer said ""you have no idea how this will end"", when indeed I did have the right idea... the shark dies and Ms. Lively makes it to shore safe. Throw a twist ending! Make it tragic. In order to kill the shark she must take her own life, so they both die, now that would've been cool.In conclusion, the Shallows is a remarkable film that has loads of suspense, thrills and action. I would definitely recommend it. but it is most likely a film you would only watch once or twice. Overall, it deserves a good rating",The Shallows

The tension builds up nicely throughout and every time the shark shows up is a treat. The only reservation that I have with this film is the end is a little silly. However you really have to suspend belief when it comes to any film that's based completely around a shark attacking people. They are always going to be unrealistic. Bottom line: The shark is awesome, hopefully this movie being successful at the box office will give way to more heavily plot based shark films; where the shark looks just as real as the one seen here. 10/10 for being the only entertaining shark film since Deep Blue Sea.",The Shallows

I am not a prude by all means, but how many butt shots do we need to see to get the idea? With so few characters it gets boring with her moaning and grunting during the whole movie. It was like the movie with Robert Redford where he was the only person in the movie and all he did was moan and grunt, that also was a horrible movie in my opinion. It starts out really slow and there are several suspenseful moments, overall it was just dumb. It has not comparison to the 1st jaws movie. I honestly couldn't wait till it was over.

Basically it contained 4 characters which all die but one person of course we know who didn't die. The ending was even worse when she kills the shark by guiding it to its death when it gets stabbed by the buoy pipes. I had waited a while to see this movie and was really disappointed, at one point the two guys come back and she is screaming shark, shes on the rocks and they ignore her, morons get in the water and soon enough are eaten. So then we are subjected to blake talking to a seagull and timing the swim, evidentally she knows the sharks swimming routine.I have really nothing more to say but have to keep writing because of the limit, let's just say I wasted 1.5 hrs of my life to route for a shark",The Shallows

Blake Lively kept the movie lively with her looks and acting.

The Shallows is able to create a very tense and frightening atmosphere, worrying when the shark will appear and threaten the main character. The suspense in this movie is beyond amazing and there is a constant sense of urgency and danger as well. The main character's life is always hanging in the balance and you never know if, or when, she will die. The lead is very likable as well, making you want to root for her, even creating a very cute and funny relationship with a bird. The camera shots are also gorgeous as well. The water and surrounding land is captured beauteously. Yet, the emptiness of the water creates a very unnerving feel and the placements of the few set pieces is unbelievable. Their is also a very strong theme of self-empowerment and finding courage in yourself. The movie is also able to jerk a few tears, which I did not expect. My only critics would be the slow start and weak backstory for the lead role. But, after the beginning sequence, I never left the edge of my seat. I would definitely recommend The Shallows to anyone and everyone!! I love this movie!",The Shallows

Thanks to the director for sticking to reality, because I'm sick of so many directors who've lost touch with the real world and getting facts straight.

Finding Nemo is a better shark movie. Little Mermaid is a better shark movie.this movie is just crap. the CG is well overdone and it seems the animation crew shared the same enthusiasm and skill you'd expect from a senior citizen inserting their 3.5"" floppy disc, discovering the dial up glory of AOL online and creating their first Myspace page complete with ""can't smile without you"" MIDI soundtrack. temporary suspension of disbelief is required if you want to believe a shark is more interested in a struggling, hot blond than 2 tons of dead whale protein.complete disregard for the physics of tides if you want to believe that one minute you're catching rolling 8 foot waves with your bros in the surf and 10 seconds later, are chilling with your homies in glass calm water well past the surf break.it doesn't end. the ominous unnamed beach. the seagull. the go pro (and suddenly unattached helmet). the tide. the belief that nature ignores tides. and that buoy. just please, please don't watch this film.",The Shallows

The director has done some incredible work with the scenery and cinematography of this film.Blake Lively is great in this film considering she had to carry the majority of the screen time and the way she acts with the shark is great considering the shark was CGI. Her acting and use of body language really gives you the feeling of fear and you put yourself into her position and this film makes you think about what you would do in this situation.As far as the shark goes this is a brilliant, realistic shark that you really do feel is in the water surrounding Nancy. Not too big to be unrealistic but not to small to reduce the fear factor. Everything about the shark is great. The director gives the shark a personality of its own and it has different situations to act to.This film does a great job of balancing the gore, reality, characters personalities, attacks and for a film that is on for under 90 minutes, it keeps you on the edge of your seat for around 70 of those minutes.Only downsides would be that i would've liked to have seen more of the shark from a personal point of view because there is a good enough build up to expect a lot more shark screen time however all said and done an outstanding film that many can't fault and I would love to see another one like this very soon.",The Shallows

Yep, totally believable. I love Blake Lively as an actress but her performance was comical because parts were so ridiculously exaggerated. There's a scene where she's been on the rock for no more than two hours and she's ""starving"" and attempts to eat a live crab and then spits it out. Another social dynamic is of her and this relationship with an injured seagull, symbolizing their mutually crappy situation together. However,it was as though the director was trying to create the same kind of survival relationship that Tom Hanks had with his volleyball, 'Wilson,"" in Castaway but totally failed. Let me mention the shark attacks. There were none. Seriously, there was before the shark was going to attack and after. There were no actual scenes of the shark actually attacking someone, aside from the one scene that they showed on the trailer that made the whole movie look like it was actually going to be an intense thriller.

This is a thought provoking masterpiece of writing and directing. It is a metaphor for loss, struggle, fight, triumph, and continuing. Here's what the story is NOT about: the story is not about a girl and a shark, it is not a story about a man's (woman's) struggle against nature, well it is kinda, but the story is centrally focused on man's (woman's) struggle against self. The story begins with a woman struggling against a terrible tragedy that she is unable to get over. She is running from her pain and her life because she's lost a sense of purpose and direction. The shark... bare with me here... is about cancer. A HUGE, aggressive, pitiless killer that is relentless and merciless. The story is about the value of the FIGHT. We fight, not for ourselves, but for those that we love. We fight for a purpose, for love, regardless of the outcome. You don't know what's going to happen, but you fight anyway because it's there and it won't let you go. The ending is especially poignant when Nancy says, ""I'm okay"". She's referring to herself, her grief, the loss of her mother, not just surviving a shark attack. And, a year later, even more powerfully, she gets back in the water, because life continues, even past the grief, the pain, the loss. This movie is poetry. It's romantic. It's Old Man and the Sea as a shark attack movie. Watch this movie again with an eye for the romantic and you may see the power in the writing, directing, and acting. Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.

She attempts to seem like that was not a life altering decision by avoiding the subject. After watching 10 minutes of the film nothing was happening. The main thing displayed was her swimming most of the time and talking on the phone to her family. Very boring and uninteresting beginning.

Yes it is a survival movie, however it has more meaning behind those struggles and the ways to solve them. Although parts of the film you might find that were similar to JAWS, according to the story telling method, but you will see there are new elements and creative details as well. 2016 was not a good year of movie (just on my personal opinion), this movie is the one that you should never miss!",The Shallows
557,alexjosiahjoyce,Horrifying... how much time I wasted getting to the end,2,16 February 2017,"Probably the most amazingly boring film I've seen in years. Long, long periods with no tension, scripting, or anticipation of any new plot elements. 2 stars only for good acting from Blake- not anywhere enough to save the film though. Cannot believe they got away with comparing this to Jaws.",The Shallows
558,leeherring-13484,Do not waste your time,1,19 August 2018,This is quite possibly the worst ever film I have seen. Second only to the Blair witch project.,The Shallows
559,yudi_ganteng,It's different from others shark movie,10,21 December 2019,It's like jaws and cast away combined together. Great plot and scenery,The Shallows
560,alixjanebrunotte,Not just another shark film,10,8 May 2017,"Just watched The Shallows and I'm in love. This was a creative survival film, I highly recommend watching it. The thriller aspect was well done, the attacks and ""gore"" was tasteful, the make up team was magnificent as well as the amount of research done on the film. The CGI shark is BEAUTIFUL its hard to believe she's not real. Blake Lively deserves an award for her performance, her acting was was natural, compassionate and realistic and made me want to see her character triumph. Not only was the film well written it was cinematically gorgeous. Full of creativity, beauty and thrill this film as become one of my new favorites. It's not ""just another Shark movie.""",The Shallows
561,kelseycpalmer,Not my favorite but i've seen worse,6,21 May 2017,"It was an OK movie. There were some parts of the movie I really liked, but there were also some parts that I didn't understand and that I didn't like. Some things that I really liked about this movie is how good the acting was, also how real everything looked. The shark and the bird look like real animals. Sometimes in movies it's very obvious that there is a green screen, but the technology here was just amazing. I was pretty entertained throughout the whole movie because of the shark. It was so ridiculous you just kept wondering what insane things it was going to do next. I'm no shark expert, but i'm pretty sure sharks don't jump onto little rock islands, jump out of the water to bite the top of a buoy to get the girl into the water, or run into a dying whale a couple of times to knock the girl off into the water so it could eat her. Why would a shark spend so much time stalking a girl to eat when there was a fresh whale carcass just a couple of yards away they it could eat with no effort. Another thing I didn't like about the movie is how predictable it was for me. Every time I saw a new person on the beach, I knew they were going to get into the water and die. I also knew that the main character, Nancy, wasn't going to die. I knew this because there really weren't any other main characters in the movie so how would they finish the movie if she was dead? I think one of the biggest things I took from this movie, is don't go places alone. Bad things always happen when you go out on big adventures alone. If you ever get into trouble like Nancy did and you have someone with you, you can get help faster. So always travel with a buddy.",The Shallows
562,darthdrane,The Shallows - TENSE!,6,16 July 2018,"Tense and gripping, Jaws this is not. But despite that I found I couldn't take my eyes off it. Pretty darned good stuff.",The Shallows
563,mnemonic-91806,Just rubbish,3,15 March 2019,"The acting and filming isn't too bad, but the entire concept, story, execution and climax was preposterously stupid.",The Shallows
564,geena_s,Doesnt make sense.,2,20 January 2019,Why is the shark so focuses on killing her. I never seen a movie were a shark is so dead set on killing one person. It would make more sense if she did something to the shark. And the only people around doesnt speak her language and there are on 8 people in the whole movie.,The Shallows
565,ingzleo,Made it to the end,3,26 August 2019,"Every stupid thing you can possibly do in that situation, she does. And she's supposed to be the smart one!?
3 stars because I managed to watch it to the end",The Shallows
