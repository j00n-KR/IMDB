0,MartinHafer,Well made but a complete lie....,6,22 May 2012,"There are LOTS of spoilers in this review. Read only if you want your illusions shattered! When the 1950s film ""Anastasia"" was made (starring Ingrid Bergman), there was still a lot of doubt as to whether or not the woman who claimed she was the Russian Princess Anastasia was her or a fraud. Some people who knew her swore that this was the princess. Some saw her as a complete charlatan. This controversy alone would make for a good film. However, by the time ""Anastasia"" was remade as a cartoon in 1997, the real facts of the story were much more clear. Anna was NOT the princess but a sadly deluded Polish lady. Genetic testing showed conclusively that she was NOT the princess--this was without doubt as her DNA did not match living relatives. Yet, oddly, the studio STILL made this film and promoted a lie!! So, while the film is reasonably enjoyable and well made for a non-Disney feature cartoon, it is 100% wrong--and promotes a lie. Speaking as a retired history teacher, I find all this very disturbing....By the way, after the cartoon debuted, the actual graves of Anastasia's family was found but her remains were not there. BUT, a short time later, her remains were found and there is zero doubt that the princess was killed almost 100 years ago.",Anastasia
1,TheLittleSongbird,This blew me away!,9,13 February 2009,"This is my personal favourite of the Don Bluth movies. I also recommend American Tail, Land Before Time and All Dogs Go To Heaven. Anastasia is just beautiful, and was one of the most requested films when we had our family cinemas. A couple of years ago, I got it on video, and all those memories came back. I love this movie so much. The animation is gorgeous. The characters are well drawn, and the backgrounds and colours are stunning. There is a lot of wit between the characters. Not to mention a truly sweet romance between Anastasia and Dimitri. Whoever hated this movie, must be told, that this is so much more watchable than Richard Rich's King and I. Anastasia herself is so beautiful. The highlights were Anastasia's dream and the scene on the train. The songs are what make this movie. My favourite is ""Once Upon a December"" as it is so nostalgic, haunting and poignant. All the other songs are well done and move the story forward. Even ""Dark of the Night"". As for the story, yes it is historically inaccurate, but so is Pocahontas, and this is marginally better. It was so well told. In some Don Bluth movies, they lose the essence right from minute one, but not here. As for the voice talents, they were all impeccable. Meg Ryan was suitably feisty as Anastasia, and Liz Callaway did her singing voice beautifully. John Cusack put an immense amount of charm into his voice-over, although Dimitri was for me was the weakest character in the movie. Kelsey Grammar has great fun as Vladmir, and also check him out as Zozi in Bartok the Magnificent. Christopher Lloyd voices villain Rasputin with over the top menace, and the villain loses his body parts here. We have all had days like that. Hank Azaria is also great as Bartok.Underrated Broadway actress Bernadette Peters has a great french accent, and I had so much fun with her singing ""Paris hold the key to your heart."" For me, Angela Lansbury provides a completely human and poignant character in the Dowager Empress. Her prologue was so well paced, and there was a side to the great character actress that I never knew she had. In conclusion, a sweet and beautiful animation that is essential to all animation lovers. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",Anastasia
2,SnoopyStyle,reasonable imitation of Disney,6,13 September 2014,"The Russian Tsar and his family are cursed by the evil Rasputin. When the revolutionaries break in, Anastasia escapes with her grandmother. However she couldn't hold on as she is left behind at the train station. Ten years later, con men Dimitri and Vladimir are looking for a young girl to pretend to be Anastasia and con the old Dowager out of her reward money. Anya follows a dog to St. Petersburg in an attempt to get to Paris. She stumbles onto Dimitri and Vladimir. She has no childhood memories and was found as a lost 8 year old child.This is a good effort for Fox Animation and is comparable to contemporary Disney fare. It looks visually beautiful and won't get embarrassed by any comparisons. The voice work is fine but Meg Ryan is a little too old to play the teenager. Hank Azaria needs to be funnier. The songs are very Broadway but none of them are memorable. It's ever so slightly disappointing to not have Meg Ryan sing. It's also tough to basically skip over most of the Russian revolution by making Rasputin an evil wizard who caused everything. It's mostly fine as a reasonable animated family movie.",Anastasia
3,gavin6942,Better Than Some Disney,7,4 December 2017,"The last surviving child of the Russian Royal Family joins two con men to reunite with her grandmother, the Dowager Empress, while the undead Rasputin seeks her death.When Disney chose Pocahontas as a historical figure to turn into a happy cartoon, they opened a can of worms. I mean, the movie is alright, but has no connection to the reality that Pocahontas went through and how traumatic it must have been.""Anastasia"" is sort of along the same lines. The story takes place in a much more recent time, but is still very much about real people. Yet, it feels more like Don Bluth got it right. Some things are wildly inaccurate (like Rasputin being a zombie), but it comes across more like a fanciful what-if story than any attempt to whitewash history. I suppose one might say they conveniently ignored almost all of the Russian Revolution, but this is a story for kids after all.",Anastasia
4,lee_eisenberg,Attention all russophiles: please help me refute this movie!,2,14 February 2018,"OK, you're going to tell me that a cartoon doesn't have to be historically accurate. Even so, Don Bluth's ""Anastasia"" contains what has to be one of the most ridiculous excuses for a story ever. At the very least, the movie could've looked at the reasons why Russia had a revolution in the first place (the monarchy and aristocracy owned everything while the people owned nothing). At least it showed the people carrying out the revolution rather than giving the Bolsheviks credit; after all, the latter merely used the revolution to seize power. As Noam Chomsky noted, Lenin killed anyone who held authentically socialist views.Most importantly, I can't figure out what went wrong with Don Bluth. In the '80s he made two of the greatest animated features ever: ""The Secret of NIMH"" and ""An American Tail"". Then in the late '80s and '90s, he turned to movies that tried to be fluffy and scary at the same time. Seriously, the depiction of Rasputin - with his name not even pronounced the Russian way - seems like its purpose is to give the tykes nightmares. Basically, every character is a cardboard cutout from Disney: the beautiful woman, the handsome man, the power-hungry villain, and his bumbling sidekick. I should say that Bartok is the only interesting character in the movie. As for the song that received an Academy Award nomination, let's just say that there's a reason why it didn't win (Elliott Smith's song from ""Good Will Hunting"" should've won).As for the cast. Let's see, we've got America's alleged sweetheart (Meg Ryan), a political activist (John Cusack), Frasier (Kelsey Grammer), Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), several Simpsons voices (Hank Azaria), the woman who wrote murder (Angela Lansbury), a Broadway star (Bernadette Peters), Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin), Mr. Dawes (Arthur Malet) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). As it turns out, another Spiderman cast member (J.K. Simmons) also provides a voice.""I stuck around St. Petersburg

5,jboothmillard,Anastasia,5,10 January 2011,"At the time of release this seemed like it was bigged up quite a lot, I saw trailers all over the place, so when I got the opportunity to finally see it I wasn't going to miss it, from directors Gary Goldman (producer of All Dogs Go to Heaven) and Don Bluth (An American Tail, The Land Before Time). Basically Young Anastasia the Grand Duchess (Kirsten Dunst) barely escapes the siege in Russia, but when her grandmother The Dowager Empress Marie (Angela Lansbury) boards a train, she is left behind with a bump on the head that takes away most of her memory. Ten years later, Anastasia (Meg Ryan), or Anya, has grown up in an orphanage, and the only clue to her past is a necklace reading ""Together in Paris"", she realises she has to somehow get there and find out who she is. Con artists Dimitri (John Cusack) and Vladimir (Kelsey Grammar) are trying to get their hands on a big cash sum by bringing The Empress her found grand-daughter, and they unknowingly find the real one. Meanwhile, power-mad sorcerer Rasputin (Christopher Lloyd) sacrificed his soul to have the royal family killed, but as the princess is still alive this has not been fulfilled, so he has been living in limbo and falling apart for the past ten years, so with the help of minion Bartok the bat (Hank Azaria) they set out to kill her. Rasputin attempts to kill Anastasia, travelling with her two companions, with a train line with missing track, and on a ship during a stormy night, but without success and they reach Paris. Over the time they have spent together, Dimitri has fallen for Anastasia, and he remembered being a young servant to the royal family, so he knows she is the real Grand Duchess. When she finds out about the con he and Vladimir planned, she storms out and misses her chance to meet The Empress, but with Dimitri's persuasion they are eventually reunited. Not long after finding out her identity is true Athe princess faces Rasputin himself, but of course he is defeated by his source of power being destroyed, and in the end Anastasia and Dimitri express their feelings for each other. Also starring Bernadette Peters as Sophie and Liz Callaway as Anastasia's singing voice. This is not apparently accurate in terms of the history of the Russian Revolution, but it doesn't matter, the voice casting is reasonable, the animation is pretty good, and the story is okay, overall, not a bad animated musical fantasy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Music for Stephen Flaherty, Lynn Ahrens and David Newman and Best Song for ""Journey To The Past"" (also nominated the Golden Globe), and it was nominated the Golden Globe for ""Once Upon A December"". Worth watching!",Anastasia
6,ComedyFan2010,Magical for both kids and adults,10,16 April 2015,"This is one of my favorite animation movies. It is beautiful and appealing to both children and adults.The story is not historically accurate, but I would think any adult, even the ones not familiar with Russian history at all would sense that there is no truth in Rasputin selling his soul to put a curse on Romanovs. Yet I am sure this beautiful movie would awake interest in people regardless of age to find out more about it. And it is also obvious why. Which kids would want to sit through the details that lead to Russian revolution, the main story of the movie isn't that anyways but the legend of Anastasia.The greatest strength of this movie is the animation. It is so beautifully mastered together with amazing colors and use of shadow. They also went a big way to be accurate in details when it comes to the settings, mainly the palaces. The story takes mainly place in St Petersburg and Paris and both places get a spirit about them I was especially in love with Russian scenery. So much magic and beauty about it. Not just in the palace but the beautiful snowy are out of the city as well.The cast to give voices to the characters is amazing. Angela Lansbury was a perfect choice for the Empress Marie. All the other main characters were also very impressive considering their star status.The music is another important element for the movie. The songs have a big variety and are beautifully sung. My personal favorite is Once Upon a December. They also did so well with collaboration the voices of the singers with those of the actors. Except for Kelsey Grammar who as I read mastered to sing Vladimir's songs on his own. I would love to go see it on stage as a musical.And as I sad it is a wonderful movie for both kids and adults. It follows a well known princess movie formula which children love. But even so the main princess is an exceptionally strong female character who does a lot of brave things in the movie and for the most wants to find herself and her roots. The evil scenes of the movie are also appealing to children, Rasputin's character was sure created to entertain them including the little bat that is his buddy. And adults enjoy more the artful animation and the music.",Anastasia
7,edwagreen,Wrong But So Very Wonderful ****,9,3 April 2006,"To all fellow history buffs out there, while this film is historically inaccurate-it is far more entertaining. After all, when we go to the movies, don't we deserve that.The animated version of ""Anastasia"" is marvelous. The singing, dancing and music are beautifully done.John Cusack and Meg Ryan are wonderful doing the voices of the heroine and Dmitry, a man who as a child, had gotten Anastasia and her grandmother out of the palace.Angela Lansbury should be made the Queen of animation. Between her role in this as the grandmother, (the animation looks like a very stern Bette Davis) and as Mrs. Potts in ""Beauty of the Beast,"" this great actress should just go on and on.The staging and the song about December are great.Christopher Lloyd's voice as the horrible Rasputin is as evil as ever.So, for now, throw out the inaccuracies and sit back and enjoy. Furthermore, this comes to you from a retired history teacher!",Anastasia
8,anaconda-40658,Well Animated Formula.,3,25 January 2016,"Anastasia (1997): Dir: Don Bluth, Gary Goldman / Voices: Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Christopher Lloyd, Kelsey Grammar, Angela Lansbury: Beautifully detailed animation with a story that isn't quite as lively. Set in Russia 1916 where Rasputin causes a revolution by casting a deadly curse upon the Ramanov family. After ten years young Princess Anastasia remembers nothing of the event yet ventures to Paris because of a locket given to her by her aunt. She is accompanied by a con man named Dimitrie who wishes to earn the reward money for her safe return. Obviously they fall in love and Rasputin will threaten a return. History established before formula sets in. Directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman who previously collaborated on All Dogs Go to Heaven. Meg Ryan gives personality to Anastasia with more input than the flat screenplay offers. Christopher Lloyd provides comic anger as Rasputin but the role is cardboard and beneath his talent. John Cusack voices the soul seeking Dimitrie in what appears to be a prop. Viewers are not surprised when he hooks up with Anastasia and they may not care either. Kelsey Grammar voices Dimitrie's companion in another drab character. Finally, these films cannot be complete without involvement of Angela Lansbury who cannot save it either. The animation is dazzling and it is an attempt to animate the classic story, which in itself falls flat. Score: 3 ½ / 10",Anastasia
9,disdressed12,"mostly entertaining and fun but should have a ""PG""rating instead of ""G""",6,20 April 2007,"this animated movie is pretty good,all things considered.i thought it was funny at times,but i thought there were too many musical numbers for my taste.also,the movie is rated ""G"" and i think it should have been rated ""PG"".there are a few scenes which i think might be a bit too intense for young children.the villain may be a bit too scary.i also thought the movie dragged a bit too much at times,though i did like the look of the film.it was very colourful and nice to look at.i'm not sure how historically accurate it is,but if that's what you look for in a movie,you should probably stick to documentaries.i thought the voice actors fit their characters well,which really helps in an animated movie.to me,this was a pretty good movie overall,though i don't think it was a masterpiece.it was mostly entertaining and fun,but again,parents should use their discretion for this one.for me,""Anastasia"" is a 6/10",Anastasia
10,cherold,Disneyfied Russian History Minus the Disney,7,28 December 2014,"This movie by Don Bluth is very similar in style to Disney films of the period. It is a very fanciful take on the Russian Revolution, which happened not because of discontented people and bad rulers but because swell rulers were magically undone by a villain who without explanation hates them passionately. This magic follows the amnesiac Anastasia as she teams up with a couple of likable grifters.At times the movie is quite enjoyable, although I always felt like it was falling a little short. The comparisons with Disney are hard to avoid, and while it does some things a bit better than Disney did in this period, Disney still tends to do more things better. One strength of Anastasia is its princess, who has more personality than Snow White or Sleeping Beauty. In her spunky determination she is more akin to the princesses Disney has pumped out in more recent years, making her ahead of her time. But while she has some personality, I would say she has a lot. The love interest is also likable but fails to be memorable.Still, the likability of the leads makes the plight of the protagonists more affecting than many Disney films of that period, and there are moments when the movie is downright touching.On the other hand, Bluth is not nearly as good at villains. Rasputin is evil, and his first appearance beyond the grave is amusingly perverse, but he's not remotely scary, never come close to someone like Malificent.The animation is quite good, and there are moments when it is really quite lovely, but again, it lacks the memorable scenes that distinguish Disney's better (and sometimes even lesser) films. There is something off about the basic structure of the film. Rasputin's pet bat seems shoe-horned into the film just because they wanted him, and he's never essential nor particularly amusing.",Anastasia
11,ironhorse_iv,This musical cartoon movie is a guilty pleasure for me. I kinda like it. It's a Shining Tsar!,7,9 May 2016,"Although communists had killed the entire imperial Romanov family in July 1918, including the Grand Duchess Anastasia by shooting squad, for years, afterwards, communist disinformation fed rumors that members of the Tsar's family had survived. The conflicting rumors about the fate of the family allowed impostors to make spurious claims that they were a surviving Romanov. The most famous, being Anna Anderson who claim to be, the long-lost child of Tsar Nicholas II, Anastasia. Because of this claim, the purported survival of Anastasia has been the subject of both cinema and made-for-television films for years, now. After all, the earliest adaptation of this myth, was made in 1928, was called 'Clothes Make the Woman', follow close by 1956's 'Anastasia' and 1986's television film, 'Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna'. However, since 1997's 'Anastasia', is the most famous adaptation movie of this myth. Its gets the most criticize. Produced by Fox Animation Studios and distributed by 20th Century Fox, this animation musical directed by Don Bluth & Gary Goldman tells the legend of Grand Duchess Anastasia (Voiced by Meg Ryan) escaping the execution of her family, during the height of February Revolutions of 1917; only to find herself, an orphan living with amnesiac. With the help of a couple of con men, Dimitri (Voiced by John Cusack) & Vlad (Voiced by Kelsey Grammar), she hopes to reunited with the last reminding family member, still alive, Empress of Russia, Maria Feodorovna (Voiced by Angela Lansbury) in Paris, France. However, the banished mystical former royal adviser, turn sorcerer, Grigori Rasputin (Voiced by Christopher Lee) thinks, otherwise, wanting to destroy the last member of the House of Romanov for revenge. Without spoiling the movie, too much, since the film is more, about the urban myth of Anastasia than true actual historical events. I allowed myself to enjoy the movie, because I took it, with a grain of salt and also the fact that, at the time, this movie was made. Anastasia's body hasn't yet, been discovered. Her body wouldn't be found until 2007, if you were wondering. Because of that, I was able to get through this film. However, I can see, why some historians can't look pass that. There were some moments in the film, even I, somewhat found, pretty jarring. First off, the film's urban legend of Anastasia's survival does not related, with the real-world supposedly 'real' reports of Anastasia's escape. After all, Anastasia was indeed, presented, during the Yekaterinburg massacre, as seen in historical Cold War archive photos. If anything, if the real Anastasia would had survived the shooting, due to the diamond corsets, her body would be still, cover with bayonet scars, bullet holes, and some sulfuric acid burns. It wouldn't be a pretty sight. Since this movie couldn't show that, it felt more like white-washing, changing history than showing what could possibility happen. It's wasn't the best choice in my opinion. After all, the whole, attempted train escape with her grandmother, Maria Feodorovna from the Winter Palace, felt a little too far deep in the fictional settling, since both of the characters weren't in St. Petersburg in real-life. In truth, during the February & October Revolution, Maria wasn't really near the royal family. She heard of the murders of her son's family, while hiding out in Crimea. Maria didn't escape until 1919, after the urging of her sister, Dowager Queen Alexandra. She fled to London, then to her home country of Denmark, not Paris, France. None of this, was ever explain in the film. Not only that, does the movie, not explain, what happen to Anastasia's family. The movie also makes Anastasia, way too close to her grandmother than their own murdered family that she rarely cares to find out. In truth, Anastasia rarely saw the former Empress, as Maria was spending a lot of time abroad when Anastasia was a child. They have little to no connection. Another big inaccuracy is the age of Anastasia, during the Revolutions. She wasn't eight years old, when the events happen. She was seventeen year old, when her family was executed on July 18, 1918. However, the biggest historical accuracy is what they did to Rasputin. Rasputin wasn't a sorcerer nor was he, a Communist. If anything, WWI, fatigue, and harsh punishment for protesters, were the leading factors to the Romanov's downfall. In real-life, Rasputin kinda love the family, and the Romanov love him, back, after he help them with the problems with Nicolas II's son, Alexei's hemophilia. After all, the Romanov's children kinda died with amulets full of Rasputin photo in their pockets in Yekaterinburg. Was he, a child molester, rapist, & womanizer? Who knows? All, I know, is that he wasn't as evil, as this film make it, out to be. In the end, the Royal family never truly betrayed him. Instead, a group of nobles coaxed Rasputin out of his house, and murdered him, by poison, shooting, and tossing him, in an icy river. Despite the fact that this movie shat all over Russia's history, the animation is stunning. Another is the voice acting. It was all wonderful. Meg Ryan and the writers got Anya right. Lively, mischievous, and sharp. Full witty remarks sometimes hit sensitive spots. That's sounds like the real Anastasia. However, the real Anastasia was nasty to the point of being somewhat evil, like tripping people and throwing rocks. Despite that, the supporting cast was just as great. Another thing, all of the music from the film is beautiful to listen to. I love the songs, 'Once Upon A December', 'Journey to the Past', and 'In the Dark of the Night'. They're all in my IPOD playlist. Overall: While, this movie indeed carbon copy, of the Disney Princess formula. I still love it to death. I think the movie gave enough actual history and respect to allow this film to fly pass the levels of 1999's 'The Legend of the Titanic', awkwardness. So go check it out! It's a lot of fun.",Anastasia
12,briancham1994,Dreamworks catches up to Disney,7,25 June 2020,"In this film, Dreamworks proves that they have what it takes to match Disney's quality. The story takes an unconventional source material and turns it into a charming and stylish adventure with pretty sights, music and animal sidekicks. Definitely not for history buffs.",Anastasia
13,Rectangular_businessman,Great film,8,12 June 2010,"I loved ""Anastasia"". It is easily one of the best movies directed by the great animator Don Bluth, who also made classics as ""The Land Before Time"" and ""The Secret of NIMH"". It has all the feeling of classic animated films like ""Snowhite"" and ""Cinderella"", with gorgeous animation, beautiful music, great voice performances and many memorable sequences. Meg Ryan and John Cusack are great in their roles, while Christopher Lloyd is great as the villain. This is a great for all the family, and it is shame that there aren't very much animated films like this in the recent times (The closest thing that I saw recently was ""The princess and the Frog"" which was pretty good)",Anastasia
14,southdavid,7 Tsars out of ten.,7,17 May 2021,"I was always a little sniffy about the sub-Disney films that Fox Animation made, such as ""Prince of Egypt"", ""The Road to El Dorado"" or ""Titan AE"" but given that since the Fox buyout they are now, technically Disney films themselves and one of the ""Anastasia"" has landed on Disney Plus.Since the fall of the Russia Royal family, rumours of circulated that the Tsar's youngest daughter is still alive. A con-artist Dimitri (John Cusack) believes that he can make some money by travelling to Paris to convinces the Dowager Empress (Angela Lansbury) that his next girl is the right woman. He meets a woman straight out of an orphanage (Meg Ryan), who he believes bears a striking resemblance and who cannot remember her early childhood years. As they travel together, they come to believe that she might be the real thing, which raises the attention of the vengeful Rasputin (Christopher Lloyd).As I said, I've always been a bit scornful about the Disney knock offs, but actually I thought that ""Anastasia"" was pretty good. The animation style has a very 'classic Disney' feel about it, which probable owes a lot to having Don Bluth as a director, who began is career working for Disney as an animator in the late 1970's, before leaving and directing ""The Secret of Nimh"" and ""An American Tail"". His co-director on this film, Gary Goldman also worked as an animator at Disney in the late 70's. Together they produce a film style that's certainly everybit as visually strong as Disney was at the time.The vocal performances and score are good too. Angela Lansbury provides another link to the Disney world, but she's joined by Meg Ryan and John Cusack as the leads and supporting performances from Kelsey Grammer, Christopher Lloyd, Hank Azaria and Bernadette Peters. The musical combination of Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens haven't really produced a classic movie score since, but they have worked consistently and won awards on Broadway. I felt the songs here were particularly strong and were nominated for the academy awards in 1998.Storyline wise it was a decent adventure. Maybe a touch predictable and perhaps the ending felt a little rushed, the protagonists are unaware that Rasputin even exists until the last ten minutes. But certainly, good enough and overall, the movie is much better than I was anticipating.",Anastasia
15,Vartiainen,Don Bluth's return to form,7,11 January 2017,"Considered by many to be the only good Don Bluth film not made in the 80s. And yeah, there's some truth to that. The 90s were not kind to this master of his craft. I could be wrong, but from what I've gathered, it seemed that he struggled with financiers and producers, who all wanted the films made their way instead of trusting his vision. Which caused the movies to suffer big time.And I'm not even so sure that that doesn't apply here as well, but at least in this case the meddlers knew what they were doing. Because let's face it. Anastasia is one big colossal Disney rip-off. It's clearly trying to cash in on the Disney Renaissance and the huge bloom in animated musical popularity it caused. And who better to help in this cashing in than Don Bluth, who used to work for Disney and during the 90s was pretty much the only Western animator alive who could even theoretically compete with the Mouse.Yet the thing is, it's a damn good rip-off. I don't mind them utilizing the Disney formula at all if it's done this well. This is an excellent film, from top to bottom. The story about a Russian princess lost during the rebellions of the 1910s and then found years later, is a good one. Sure it's based on real events only in the loosest terms possible, but that's the formula. The music is also fantastic. Bluth's films have always suffered from lackluster scores, but this has some really good music numbers. In the Dark of the Night might very well be one of my all-time favourite villain songs.And it looks fantastic! This is Don Bluth competing on the level of Disney and in some brief instances even eclipsing the studio that gave him his beginning. The backgrounds especially are gorgeous beyond belief and you find yourself lost in them, staring at the amount of detail and artwork.Now, the only real nitpick I have is the ending. It falls short. There's really no other way to say it. Rasputin, the villain of the movie, has been built up big time, but when he finally meets Anastasia... It's really disappointing. I can't spoil anything here, but come on.But, aside from that, it's a great film. Definitely worth a watch for all those that grew up with the Disney Renaissance and love the art form.",Anastasia
16,lisafordeay,A nice family film all about family and who you are,8,22 September 2010,"I have liked this movie since it came out although I bought it on DVD 6 years ago for Christmas. The movie is set in the year 1916 and a young princess named Anastasia is suffering from amnesia as she tries to get on the train with her grandmother. 10 years later and Anya is now in an orphanage and she is trying to find her family. The only clue she has is a necklace which reads 'Together in Paris'.So she meets two con men one who used to work at the palace and the other is a friend of Dimitri's. As the two con men agree to help Anya find her family romance blossoms along the way for our heroine and you can probably guess the rest for yourselves. I can't believe that many people mistake this for a Disney movie because its actually a 20th Century Fox movie NOT Disney. Packed with great actors Meg Ryan,John Cusack, Hank Azaria,Christopher Lyold and great music from Liz Callaway, Anastasia is the perfect film to watch at Christmas and its worth watching.",Anastasia
17,hellraiser7,Journey to the Past,10,30 May 2014,"As a kid the unsolved mystery of Anastasia always fascinated me, it was much like with the Elvis sighting stories because of the possibility of what if. It made me wonder what if somehow Anastasia did survive and was still alive, may'be she lost her memory and doesn't know or she choose not to be found. Despite the fact this mystery has been solved recently in 2007, it didn't delude the mystery that fascinated me so much, because questions and the possibilities we draw up are most of the time what we thrive on in life than the answers themselves.This film is one of my favorite animated films that I personally think is under the radar.The animation by one of my favorite if underrated animated directors Don Bluth is top notch in my book as usual. Like the livelihood of the movement, the background animation is great capturing both 1900s Russia and Paris beautifully. But mainly I like the character designs which make them stick out.The music is just beautiful, the songs are excellent and memorable. Two of my favorites are ""At the Beginning"" which is a romantic song. However my favorite song is ""Journey to the Past"" which is just beautiful and has a range of emotion because it's simply about Anna's journey to find her past to find home.But to me it's the story and characters that power this film.I really like the story, like with the film ""Bubba Ho Tep"" it plays on the what if concept of Elvis still alive. This film is pretty much a fairy tale but in a contemporary reality which I don't see much, except may'be in the TV show ""Once Upon a Time"".The antagonists are solid, Rasputin (voiced well by Christopher Lloyd one of my favorite actors and voice actors)he's a villain you love to hate as he has some really good lines. He's pretty much just simply a power hording psycho that is just bent on getting power in the worst possible way.I even like the subordinate villain Bartok voiced by one of my favorite voice actors and underrated actor ""Hank Azaria"" (yeah for the record I'm a Simpsons fan) he's just a fun and cute antagonist you don't hate, he's just fun and funny has some of the best lines. He's sort of a villain for hire, doesn't care about his boss's cause or even his boss himself; he's just a person (or bat) that is just doing what he's paid to do but also has enough common sense to walk away.I really like the protagonist Anastasia (voiced well by Meg Ryan), she's beautiful inside and out, she's got charisma, sweet, but also really feisty, can hold her own against danger, but most of all just has this unwavering hope that she will find something in her life to make her whole, which all the more makes her someone we want to bet on to win because after what she's been though she deserves it. But she's a character you do feel a slight sense of pathos for as she's simply a person that is lost and is in need of home and love in her life. From what we already know of her past it's actually really sad, since most of her family has been deceased for some time which means she literally has no home to come back to and the fact she can't remember them very well is awful. Personally I feel what she's really looking for isn't so much the past, but it's really her own destiny, it's not so much just a home she's wants but her own life to be able to create and call someplace home.Demetri (voiced well by John Cusack an actor I like) is my favorite character in the film because he's a protagonist but an unconventional one. He's sort of like the last guy you really would bet on to save the day, he's obviously not perfect but sometimes these kinds of protagonists are the best kind let alone interesting. He's the kind of guy that looks out for number one, is wanting to get rich quick despite breaching ethical boundaries, and he's a bit of a user. He's kinda funny, he's got some sharp charisma which means he got some of the best lines. But to me what makes this character likable is thought the journey and his time with Anna he does grow in character and does the right thing.I really like the chemistry between both Anna and Demetri, this is one of those romances that actually work as both interact and warm up to one another which I think is believable. I even like that dance scene between them which was sweet. We then see as Anna is gaining some happiness in her life again, Demetri is beginning to change his mind about the scheme and he not just is beginning to discover the true identity of Anna but is having genuine feelings for her, which makes him realizes that there really are more things more important than money and it's not what he really needed after all.In a way you can say this is a story of redemption for the character as he's had a shady past that he himself isn't proud of, by completing the mission to return and protecting Anna he may also have a home of his own as well, since he himself just like Anna is without a home and love. Both were in pursuit of different things but were really in pursuit of each other.Overall this I feel is a great animated film that like any great mystery is worth uncovering.Rating: 4 stars",Anastasia
18,davispittman,One of the best!,10,9 April 2016,"Anastasia (1997) is honestly one of the greatest animated films of all time! Meg Ryan and John cusack voice their characters wonderfully, their voices really fit the animated characters well. The script and screenplay is awesome, very well constructed. This movie is of course very family friendly, and it's also very smart and clever, it really shows the writer's talent. I adore the visual effects too, the animation is very state of the art, and the effects are cool looking and a pleasure to see. Rasputin is a great character too! He is the films villain, and he is written very well! He is funny when he needs to be, menacing when he needs to be. His cute little bat assistant is hilarious! I absolutely loved his character, he brought lots of cute amusing anecdotes and lines to the movie. The chemistry between Anastasia and Dimitri is electric! I love the great romantic chemistry between them. Angela Lansbury was cast perfectly to voice Anastasia's grandmother, and her character was written beautifully as well, when they sing once upon a December together, oh my gosh, chills!! The musical numbers are fantastic too! I really love the songs, they just click and work well with the scenes they are in. 10/10 for Anastasia! Will always hold a special place in my heart!",Anastasia

The animation was at times stunning and others pretty outputting to me so that sort've cancels out.The whole thing is just kinda mediocre. It made zero impression on me and hours later I can already feel myself forgetting it. Still, it would make for good family fare if you're looking for something to throw on.",Anastasia
20,Spleen,"Pleasant, not great - Bluth's best",7,8 December 1999,"I'd given up on Don Bluth.  He struck me as a decent animator who had risen to his level of incompetence when he became a director, producing sugary, ill thought out kids' movie after sugary, ill thought out kids' movie.  I still think this is more or less true.  But `Anastasia' was an unexpected pleasure.For a start, Bluth is more than just a `decent' animator.  I wonder how he managed to find the time to produce and direct the film, AND animate Anastasia (the character) so soulfully.  In some ways Bluth's style is now very old-fashioned, but it's still his style, and he gives Anastasia at least as much charm as the story requires her to have.The film as a whole I'm willing to cautiously endorse, too.  The basic idea - of a con artist whose latest `forgery' is genuine - indeed, he even knows it's genuine, without knowing that he knows it's genuine - is strong enough and well enough handled to sustain the film.  A pity Bluth ignores it so often.  His biggest detour from the main story is the needless supernatural villainy, which leads in turn to needless (and ugly) computer animation, and a needless sidekick: Bartók, the bat.  (Why name the bat after a Hungarian composer?  Is there some joke I'm not getting?)  That sidekick is probably the single most disastrous character in the film.  Bluth is unable to decide if it's a reluctant villain, a thorough-going rotter, a sweetie, or merely something with a silly voice.  It's the kind of `character' one often encounters in his films.So is Bluth STILL, in my estimation, a director of sugary, ill thought out kids' movies?  Well, one out of three.  `Anastasia' is not (in the deadly sense of the term) a kids' movie, and it's not sugary.  But it IS ill thought out.  Bluth really needs to hire someone to write and direct for him, so that he can concentrate on drawing.",Anastasia
21,LeonardKniffel,The Legend Comes to Animated Life,8,2 May 2020,"The story of Anastasia, murdered daughter of the last monarch of Imperial Russia, makes the perfect vehicle for this tale about the impostor who tried to fool the world into thinking that Anastasia had not died with the rest of her executed family.

23,vip_ebriega,The best Disney movie not made by Disney.,10,10 September 2008,"My Take: First-rate animation, terrific voice cast and brilliant old-fashioned storytelling.It's hard not to mention Disney when it comes to talking about ""Great Animated movies"". They really started it by the way, and they perfected it. Anyone who even tries to challenge Disney (and eventually some did) will fail in comparison. Oh! Did I say anyone? Turns out, there is at least one film that manages to stand up and turn out to be a worthy successor. This is 20th Century Fox's animation studios pet project ANASTASIA, a brilliant, colorful and fast-moving romance adventure that, at some point, is a reason for the Mouse House to get a little worried. With colorful animation (rivals any of the studio's recent creations), tuneful music and no lack of energy (be it as an adventure, a romance or a comedy), ANASTASIA takes a big chance, and succeeds magnificently.It's probably best to mention that ANASTASIA is helmed by director/animator Don Bluth, who once had work at the Mouse House, and after leaving, tried to challenge Disney's work with his own efforts with other studios. His animated efforts, save THE LAND BEFORE TIME, weren't exactly worthy sit at the Disney throne. Despite some charming intentions, Bluth's fairy tales specifically THE American TALE, much-maligned ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN and the by-the-numbers PEEBLE AND THE PENGUIN didn't reach the height already visited many times by Disney. Simply just comparing Bluth's works to Disney's works says it all. Simply the mention of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and THE LION KING will have these rival films running for cover.But Bluth's found his BEAUTY IN THE BEAST with this one, and while not everyone will apply, ANASTASIA is a brilliant Disney successor, sometimes actually better and more mature than some of Disney's works (Shhhh! Don't say it out loud but I kinda like it a little more than BEAUTY AND THE BEAST). The animation is an improvement over Bluth's latter efforts, which can easily be described as a poor-man version of Disney animation. The animation here is far better, a marvelous fusion of the new computer-animation and the old traditional paper-and-pencil method. The final effect is outstanding and vibrant, if not nearly flawless. The voice cast is brilliant, living up to the tradition that the only way to drag adults to see an adaption of a fairy tale is to see a big-star name on the top billing. The cast in ANASTASIA are brilliant in lending their acting skills as voices to animated characters. The standout is Meg Ryan, as the voice of orphaned Anya (with singing voice by Liz Callaway) who may just be the long-lost-but-rumored-to-be-alive Grand Duchess of the title, who rivals any Disney princess simply for her spunk.As Anya's own leading man, a love-hate relationship (a more topical subject for a G-rated effort) with con man Dimitri (voiced by John Cusack, singing-voice by Jonathan Dokuchitz), who plans to get all the money and acclaim he wants when he delivers a convincing Anastasia stand-in to the very-worried Dowager Empress Marie (the great Angela Lansbury). On the other hand, Christopher Lloyd offer his voice to the evil monk Rasputin who wants to avenge his infamy by cursing the Romanov family. Assisting him is his Albino Bat sidekick Bartok (voiced by Hank Azaria). Apparently, the villain is where the film might get its flaws. Whereas Disney villains pack a strong punch, Rasputin is your garden-variety villain. He's a creep, an evil wizard who has command of evil goblins and critters at his own disposal. He's a distraction to be sure, but thanks both to Lloyd's eccentric energy and the animators limitless imaginations (Rasputin's little demons are quite original, not to mention bold and a little scary, for an animated film), he's a welcome distraction.Overall, the Mouse House is still on top, but ANASTASIA may be one of the few non-Disney movies that gave them a reason to worry. Rating: ***** out of 5.",Anastasia
24,DarthBill,Beautiful animated feature allegedly based on the true story,8,23 September 2006,"Plot in a nutshell - at the beginning of the 20th century, Russia is thrown into chaos when Czar Nicholas and most of his family is killed thanks to a curse by the evil ""sorcerer"" Rasputin (voice of Christopher Lloyd), but one daughter, Anastasia (voiced by Kirsten Dunst as a child), manages to survive, for better or worse, but with amnesia. Years later, the adult Anastasia (voiced by Meg Ryan, once of one of Hollywood's most sought after actresses, her career now in a state of severe disrepair thanks to her much over publicized fling with Russell Crowe), known only as Anya, is released from a Russian orphanage with no memory of her past, her only clue being a necklace with an intimate message written on it that indicates Paris as a place of importance. In trying to get to Paris, she falls in with two charmingly lovable scoundrels, Dmitri (voice of John Cusack) and Vlad (Kelsey Grammar); the two con-men intend to present an ""Anastasia"" lookalike to the Duchess (voice of Angela Lansbury), the last surviving member of the Royal Family, who is holding meetings with girls claiming to be Anastasia in hopes of finding the real one so that they can get the reward money she's offering. Initially unaware that Anya is the real Anastasia but merely assuming that she is an uncanny lookalike, Dmitri & Vlad decide to clean Anya up and present her to the Duchess. Along the way, long buried secrets are revealed and unexpected feelings arise as the nearly dead Rasputin and his bat sidekick Bartok try to destroy the trio.Beautifully animated feature courtesy of Don Bluth, you'd almost swear this was one of the great Disney features. Strong animation is complimented by competent voice acting by the big stars, notably Meg Ryan throwing out her perkiest voice possible. Historically inaccurate, but who cares?",Anastasia
25,Animany94,Don Bluth's surrender to the Disney-formula.,8,22 January 2018,"Anastasia is by far the only good Don Bluth movie from the 90's. Considering his earlier 90's movies which were terrible. This was the only one to make any money, and that is mainly because, let's face it, he surrendered to the hegemony of the Disney-formula with princesses and romance and musical song-and-dance numbers. It's by no means the worst thing he could do, because the final product turned out pretty damn well. As long as you do not mind the history aspect of the story. It is fiction with characters named after historical personalities, nothing more. Just like Disney's ""Pocahontas"", but done a million times better. The characters are well made and play off each other very well, indeed. The villain we get is well balanced between being silly and intimidating. And he, in my opinion, has the greatest song in the movie! Damn, ""In the Dark of the Night"" is awesome with great animated movement, a prominent choir which adds to the grandeur of it and a great build-up from start to finish. The other songs are good, too. ""Once Upon a December"" is melodic and catchy
with a beautifully animated scene when it is being played for the first time in the movie. I sometimes wonder why that one wasn't nominated for the Acedemy Award for best original song, but settled for a Golden Globe nomination. Personally, I don't find ""Journey to the Past"" that spectacular. I like Anastasia, but i'm still kind of torn on it, because it still buys so much into the Disney-formula that many casual movie-goers still refer to it as ""that Disney movie"". I like it, but I prefer Bluth's movies from the 80's.",Anastasia
26,bellino-angelo2014,Very on par with the Disney movies of those years,8,8 March 2020,"Before I go to the review I have to take off my chest something I had to say since a long time: I am NOT a huge fan of Don Bluth's movies since I think that they are knock-offs of the Disney movies of the 1980s-1990s. But after I saw ANASTASIA. since I had low expectations, I proved myself wrong since it was much better than I thought. Now I can go on with the review.In 1916 during a ball the Dowager Empress Marie (Angela Lansbury) gives a small necklace to his youngest granddaughter Anastasia. But after a sudden arrival by Grigory Rasputin (Christopher Lloyd) that causes the Russian Revolution, Marie and Anastasia escape but Anastasia falls and ends in an orphanage. 10 years later Anastasia (Meg Ryan) is found by Dimitry and Vladimir (John Cusack and Kelsey Grammer), two con men that help her in the journey back to Marie while Rasputin, being undead, seeks revenge towards her family.Everything in this movie seems on par with the Disney princesses movies of those years. The animation is great, with very vivid colours and backgrounds. The voice acting is also spot-on: Meg Ryan as Anastasia, Angela Lansbury as the Dowager Empress Marie and John Cusack as Dimitri are the most honorable mentions of the vocal cast. Christopher Lloyd as always steals the scene as the villain Rasputin. The soundtrack is probably the best thing of this movie, with very likeable and catchy songs from the beginning to the end.In substance, even tho you are not into Don Bluth movies, it doesn't necessarily mean that you won't like this movie, and the fact that I liked it says a lot.",Anastasia
27,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,Don Bluth's excellent comeback and it's been almost 15 years since it's release!,9,13 August 2012,"Well, Don Bluth. Looks like you've found a way to make another successful film in your career. It's been a long time since you released such great family hits like ""The Secret of NIMH"" (avoid the god-awful sequel if you know what's good for you), ""An American Tail"", ""The Land Before Time"", and ""All Dogs Go To Heaven"" and even though your career later went downhill with new films like ""Rock-A-Doodle"", ""Thumbelina"", and ""The Pebble and the Penguin"", I've found them decent and watchable while A Troll in Central Park, although not a terrible movie, was in my opinion not a good film.Then, finally, you made a great comeback by competing with Disney yet again this time with another successful film ""Anastasia"" based on not only the historical event, but the 1956 movie as well. Before I begin this review, I want to say that I never saw the 1956 movie or read the historical event (I did learn it in class though, but I'm getting ahead of myself), but that doesn't take away the fact that I apparently loved this movie much like anyone else who grew up with it (So did I). I've heard that lots of people hated this movie for it's historical inaccuracies, but let me remind you that this is a children's movie since the violence from that event might be pretty graphic for younger kids. That's why Don Bluth decided to change all of that.Historical inaccuracies aside, I was enthralled by it's average, but magnificent animation and the character animation is decent. Not great, but still good. The characters themselves are well-developed. Anastasia (short-named Anya) is a likable protagonist and I liked her attempts to find out about her past. Dimitri is pretty good too with some great chemistry between him and Anastasia. Other characters including the hilarious comedic talking bat Bartok are likable as well, but the only character that I like the most is Rasputin who was by far a great non-Disney villains and is one of the most darkest ones yet along with some of Disney's villains. Even his dark magic sorcery is great which makes him very original.The story is dark, but not as dark as The Secret of NIMH and although, despite it's historical inaccuracies, it's at least good and the pacing never fails to amuse me, but the strongest aspect goes to the songs/music from David Newman with some great haunting and melodic tunes including ""Once Upon a December"" ""Journey to the Past"", ""In The Dark of the Night"" and more and the voice acting with some great talents like Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Angela Lansbury, Hank Azaria, and Christopher Lloyd since they fitted the characters very well throughout the entire film.Anastasia is this close to becoming a masterpiece of animation. I know lots of people hated this movie for it's historical inaccuracies, but as an animation fan, I'm recommending this to others highly as one of Bluth's best works yet. It's also great to see that it made lots of money at the box office. Thumbs up from me!",Anastasia
28,meydiana-65242,Based on a true history but a fictional story.,10,6 November 2020,"While I know the movie is not historically accurate, I don't care! The movie is fiction after all- based on a true story (of Anastasia's rumored escape and women who claimed to be her), loosely, mind you- but perhaps it is not as unlikely as it seems: when the remains of the Romanovs were discovered back in 1991, Alexei (her brother,the Czarvitch) and one of the Grand Duchesses were missing. And with age analysis of the bones, scientists believe that the missing daughter is in fact Anastasia, and not one of her sisters, Olga, Tatiana, or Maria. But who really knows what happened?My opinion of the movie is that it is wonderful. It draws you into the world of the lost Russian Princess, to a time that is ""far away, long ago"", that doesn't exist anymore.The music and animation are stunning, and the photo research of St. Petersburg is amazing! Take the Catherine Palace and the magnificent gate you see, as well as the city itself. The 3-D animation is amazing; you look like you could reach out and touch it! The music is truly magical; ""Once Upon a December"" (especially Deana Carter's version)is haunting yet beautiful. I own the soundtrack- I listen to it frequentlyto help me relax.But what I love best about the movie is the romance that occurs between Anya(Anastasia) and Dimitri. It starts out as a con, a trick for money, and turns into a love story. I think it shows that people really do have good in them, and that true love really exists. It's also heartwarming to think that a young boy who saved the girl he liked (princess or not) later helps her restore her identity and find a true place (in this case, happily together with him).""Anastasia"" is really my favourite movie of all time, even though now I'm almost 23. I'd recommend it to anyone, and advise historical literialists to look beyond the fiction and let yourself be taken on a ""Journey to the Past"" with the romance, comedy, and magic of this story.",Anastasia

Even though the animation quality is a little bit clumsier than its coeval rivals such as 'Hercules' and 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame', the story, the romance, the chemistry among characters, the voice acting, and the music are of fine quality. Like many animation movies, 'Anastasia' is based on a real historical figure, but the story is created completely. The way this movie develops the story follows typical narrative structure; it's not a bad thing. This means it is working to lead and capture audience through out storytelling.

31,Mort-31,Thank God We Have Disney!,5,8 February 2001,"We can be happy to have these very noble Disney cartoons. It's the only kind of film, in my opinion, that still has the right to paint characters black and white. I think, human beings feel the desire to have some characters to love and some to hate in movies, but nowadays such primitive characterizations are frowned upon by the critics. Luckily, there are Disney's cartoons, where you don't expect anything else, where you can, without problems, paint good people beautiful and cute and evil people grey and ugly. Thus, every material can be turned into a film for children. In this special case, of course, historians won't be quite happy to hear that it was Rasputin who expelled the Romanoff family...With the characters in Anastasia`, I had to laugh. Anastasia and Dimitri are a screen couple that doesn't fit into a 1920s Russia at all. They reminded me rather of George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer in One Fine Day`. I say only one word: emancipation! So, time also left its mark on the Disney movies. We have to accept that, but we will, as long as they keep the old-fashioned touch they always had.Yeah, there's another thing left. I've mentioned this in other comments. To all the synchronizers in the world: Please, don't dub songs! It always, always sounds false and amateurish. Thank you.",Anastasia

About whether Anatasia really survived the Bolsheviks' killings.General conclusion - she never survived at all.So when back then this was shown on the television like few years back (it's already after my History classes), I had actually heard so much about the various factual errors it had surfaced in this animated movie. Okay, maybe occasionally I will jump out and say this is not right and all that, but then eventually I thought, I am watching an animated movie anyway. I just need to sit back and enjoy...I have to really admit, the presentation is kind of nice as I was watching.

I saw who was doing the vocalizations and I was thrilled.Too bad it didn't live up to the hype.I guess my biggest disappointment was Rasputin. The real Rasputin was a strange enough character without making him an immortal evil antagonist.Yes...I know it's a kids movie (although, it's too scary for little kids!)but I feel it could have been handled better.Having said that, the rest of the movie is OK.

But now that I've seen it again, it's clear that the songs are well written, along with the storyline.This is not based on a true story, only loosely on a few rumors that the real Anastasia survived the killing of her family. The heroine Anya is like a Disney princess who is desperate to find out who she is and where she belongs, after suffering from amnesia following the separation of her family. The villain is the brilliant Rasputin, back from the dead, intent on extracting revenge on the Romanovs, thus starting the Russian Revolution. Dimitri and Vladimir at first are looking to find the ideal Anastasia look alike in order to get the riches from her real mother in Paris.A lot of Bluth's films revolve around a journey and a couple involving some history on Russia. I really enjoyed the songs that played over the end credits, ""At the Beginning"" and ""Journey To The Past"" sung in her own way by Aaliyah, the beautiful angelic voiced R&B singer who left way too soon.Brilliantly animated for its time and enjoyable for adults, Anastasia remains a classic family film.",Anastasia

And now she's out searching for her and her grandmother is doing likewise. Do they make their way back to each other? That's depends on the con men and Rasputin.

38,MinistryofDoom,"Not quite a ""true story"" but still a wonderful animated classic",6,5 May 2019,"This film is a Don Bluth masterpiece of cel-animation. Truly, every frame could be a displayed work of art. The story is compelling and enjoyable, though often very dark at times. Although it is inspired by the true-story of Russian Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna, daughter of the last emperor of Russia, Nikolai the 2nd, whose family were overthrown before the fall of the Russian Empire and the subsequent rise of Communism, the film itself takes a a huge departure from the factual history on which it is based. For one thing, history tells us that the fate of Anastasia was not as depicted in the film. For another, the fall of the Russian Empire was far more brutal and violent than what is shown in the film: the family escaping from the palace and living as socialites in European exile. Though certainly I understand that in order to mold it into an animated family film, it required certain revisions in story-telling. Nevertheless, if you forget the Russian history aspect of the film, you are still left with a wonderfully animated (and musical) tale of a young girl overcoming adversity and restoring her family honor...which I think is a timeless narrative that more than certainly keeps viewers engaged.",Anastasia
39,f-88612,A Disney clone done right,7,11 May 2021,"This film is mistaken for Disney more than any other animated film out there, due largely in part to it copying many aspects of the ""1990s Disney Princess formula"" thanks to Don Bluth being at the helm. It is mistaken for a Disney film so often that, at one point, if you were to search ""Anastasia"" on Google, one of the very first search suggestions would be ""anastasia disney"".The 1997 animated film seems to have pretty well eclipsed the 1956 live-action film of which it was a loose remake. And that's not to mention the stage play which the 1956 version was based off of. Don Bluth claims that he never would have done this movie had he not just spent years of getting pummeled by disappointing box office returns and production nightmares, not to mention several films he was less-than-proud of. It paid off though, and became his highest-grossing film.Bernadette Peters was annoyed at the design for Sophie. As she was very physically fit at the time of production, she didn't like that Sophie was drawn ""so heavyset"". Don Bluth also regretted Vlad's design, feeling his cartoonish appearance was out of place against Anya and Dimitri's more realistic figures. Part of the reason this film is often mistaken for a Disney production is its stellar animation, especially as this was one of the very last hugely successfully hand-drawn animated films; the layouts fully embrace the richness of Russian culture during the scenes in St. Petersburg and later of Paris which eventually takes the form of a series of Van Gogh paintings during the ""Key to Her Past"" sequence.",Anastasia

Anastasia, by Fox Studios, sets out to capture that same blockbusting brilliance, and achieves some of it. Anastasia has a strong visual look, headstrong protagonist, entertaining sidekicks and a memorable villain.The film isn't very original, the best stuff feels like a rehash of aforementioned Disney classics. The thing I like best is its realistic feel - the story takes place in 20th century Europe, not some faraway fairy kingdom. There is some magic connected to Rasputin, the bad guy, but it fits in the setting.The songs are alright.

But if your kids like the movie, it might get them interested in the Russian Revolution or the roaring 20s in Paris, and then you can give them a more accurate impression. Anyway, this has been a favorite of my daughter since she was five, when she was still watching on laptops, especially during trips to Florida; we recently watched it all together on blu ray, and my 6-year old son was particularly drawn to the macabre elements of the film, namely Rasputin, his demons, and Bartok. The best thing about the film is its animation and its grand portrayals of St. Petersburg, the Russian wilderness, and Paris (i.e. The Opera Garnier); Anastasia's determined personality is also appealing. It's at the level of some Disney princess movies in terms of production values and plots, but in a sense, it is anti-princess, at least on the surface: Anastasia's family has been forever deposed, and when she is reunited with her aunt, she chooses to elope with her lower-class boyfriend than to participate in the glamor of expatriate royal society in Europe. Of course, Rasputin was a monk, not a sorcerer, but who can resist his green potions, constantly detaching body parts, familiar (and ultimately friendly) bat, and the catchy song: ""In the dark of the night, evil will find you,"" which we were all singing for several weeks after we watched it.",Anastasia
42,Ginger87,A Wonderful Family Movie,10,27 August 2004,"*May Contain Spoilers*I first saw ""Anastasia"" when it came out in theaters when I was ten years old.  I found it to be an amazing and charming movie.  The songs were great, my favorite was ""Paris Holds the Key (To Your Heart)"", and the animation was good.  My favorite part was the ball room scene.Many people didn't like the movie ""Anastasia"" because they felt it was too inaccurate.  But it didn't bother me because it's just a family movie and not a history report.Everyone should see this movie cause it is a great film with good songs.  I give this movie 10/10 stars.",Anastasia
43,Vampenguin,Very good cartoon,8,12 March 2006,"Though I did see this film at a relatively young age, I only watched it once and hardly remembered any of it. I quite enjoyed it this time around, with the exception of a few of the songs. Most of the song were pretty catchy though, I still have that ""Paris Holds the Key To Your Heart"" one stuck in my head! The plot was interesting and exciting, despite criminally straying from the source material. Last but not least, Rasputin made a great villain, hats off to Christopher Lloyd for yet another great performance! Hank Azaria was also great as Rasputin's comic relief bat sidekick, Bartok. He later got his own spin-off which isn't nearly as good as this film, needless to say. Overall, if you like animated films this is a must-see! 8/10",Anastasia

I love the romance in the movie as well.",Anastasia
45,xbrad68,My part Russian Fiancé hinted she was a Romanov Russian Royal Family,9,17 March 2006,Anastasia is an entertaining movie. The voice of John Cusack as one of the con men was interesting. Bartok the bat makes a good villain sidekick. It is unlikely that Rasputin would have survived the 1910s. Recently the remains of the Russian Royal Family were dug up from a mass grave and sadly everyone was there including Anastasia Romanov. I still believe that my Fiancé could be a Romanov Russian Royal Family direct Descendant and a descendant of King David and King Solomon. I asked the Canadian Government to put the Cartman family of Sudury and the Gta on a list for the long term bunkers.Since I alerted MI5 and the CIA to the plans of the United Nations Security Council Permanent members to release 4 superflus kill billions and stop global warming. as the American Shadow Vice President Brad HD Morgan I sleep a whole lot better knowing that I did not sign the plan possibly following the advice of American Shadow President Jack F Kennedy not to sign.. I may have saved many lives like the fictional Greatest American Hero. Who could it be? Believe it or not its just me. The other movies of John Cusack are also worth watching.,Anastasia
46,jaddison383,Enchanting!!!,7,7 February 2007,"This is one of the best animated films I've ever seen- and I've seen quite a few. This one stands out above the rest. It never fails to impress.This is the story of Anastasia, princess and air to the Russian throne. She is separated from her family while she is very young as the Russian monarchy is overthrown by the evil Rasputin. Then, ten years later, the Dowager Empress (Anastasia's grandmother) offers 10,000 rubles for her return, and Dimitri, the old palace kitchen boy plots to hire a girl to pretend to be Anastasia and get the reward. EHo should he find, but the real Anastasia, long-lost at an orphanage and with no memory of who she really is. And as Dimitri and his friend take Anastasia to try and meet her grandmother, Rasputin plots to destroy her.Despite all of that, it ends up being one of the better movies of it's year, and one of the greatest of all animated. Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammar, Christopher Lloyd, and Angela Lansbury contribute fine voicing to the animated characters, and their voices never seem awkward. However, it's the great music and songs that steal the show. Liz Callaway's singing for Anastasia is especially breath-taking.Of course, the animation itself is great. It never looks fake or falls into unrealisticness as so many animated films do. It only compliments the witty and touching script.Ultimately, what makes Anastasia so good is the story. It's a story that connects and moves us all This is an example of what good film-making is: it's funny, entertaining, and very sweet. And really, the songs are great. I love it! 8/10 stars!

47,jburtroald95,Extraordinary!,10,29 March 2009,"This glorious masterpiece is a fairytale extravaganza to match 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' (1937) and 'Beauty and the Beast' (1991.) With this clearly we have been spoilt as the music, drama, adventure, emotion,and acting is seemingly far too incredible to be in just a simple animated family film.The story is excellently crafted and follows a lost Russian princess (voiced splendidly by Meg Ryan)brought up in an orphanage and later picked up by two shifty con-men (John Cusack and Kelsey Grammar really bring these two to life) on her journey to finding her past as well as her throne and loving grandmother (passionately voiced by Angela Lunsbury) with the deranged and vengeful villain Rasputin (who is made extra chilling by Christopher Lloyd) and his clumsy little servant Bartok (Hank Azaria manages to get a few little laughs out of us with this character) in hot pursuit of her.Much like the likes of 'The Lion King' (1994) this film has a huge impact and a great deal to offer. It is definitely well-worth seeing.",Anastasia

50,Criticman12,An animated classic based on a true story,10,15 February 2011,"During the 80's, Don Bluth made some good classics like, ""The Secret Of Nimh"", ""The Land Before Time"", ""An American Tale"", and one of my favorite's, ""All Dogs Go To Heaven"".But in 90's, his career started to go downhill. But one day, 20th Century Fox asked him to direct an animated adaptation of the Broadway show, ""My Fair Lady"" or do a film about Anastasia Romanov. He decided to do a film about Anastasia Romanov. The result: A great comeback for Don Bluth and an animated classic.The animation is great, the songs were great, the story was great, and the voice acting was great. Meg Ryan does a good job as the independent, Anastasia. Christopher Lloyd does a great job as the evil, Rasputin. Hank Azaria does a good and funny job as Rasputin's bat sidekick, Bartok.Overall, ""Anastasia"", is a great animated film that's worth watching.",Anastasia

52,Chrissie,A break from the old Bluth drivel,8,9 September 2002,"After nearly gagging over All Dogs Go To Heaven and Land Before Time, I cringed when my daughter pulled Anastasia off the shelf in the video rental shop. But other than the unnaturally big eyes (like the velvet paintings sold at gas stations), the animation was fresh and charming. And other than Rasputin's ghastly number, the songs were catchy. ""Journey to the Past"" and ""Once Upon a December"" touch a nerve with their themes of yearning for home and belonging, without being needlessly maudlin.Okay, the history was fuzzy. I expected that. Filmmakers can be forgiven for taking a legend (that Anastasia survived the massacre of the Romanoffs) and running with it. And if it sparks a few kids' interests in the real Romanoffs, so much the better.The train wreck is exciting, Dmitri is conniving and charming, and the ghostly waltz scene rivals the ballroom scene from Beauty and the Beast. Finally Bluth produced a film parents could watch and enjoy along with the children.",Anastasia
53,brettchatz-1,Fairy tales brings dream to life,7,14 November 2008,"Starring the voice talents of Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Christopher Lloyd and Kelsey Grammar At the turn of the century Imperial Russia was undergoing the throes of revolution. It didn't take long for Tzar Nicholas Romanov and his family to be murdered and replaced by the Bolsheviks.That was the end of Tzarist Russia in 1917.But this film is something else entirely - a beautiful romance between a peasant palace worker and the impetuous and excitable Anastasia Romanov. This is a journey through life, a quest for truth on a road less traveled.Young Anastasia has no recollection of her past, but she is soon won over by a charming swindler who takes her to Paris to meet up with the Empress of Russia. Action, adventure and romance awaits!",Anastasia
54,bbbl67,Unexpectedly good film,7,26 May 2003,"Don Bluth seems to be a relic left over from the old days of Disney. His cartoons have that unmistakable old Disney feel to it. And the storylines are also pretty Disney-like. Some people might say that's a good thing, but I think that's a bad thing. Sure the old cartooning style was beautiful, and the old storylines became film classics. But the idea of good filmmaking is to come up with something original and new. Okay, so Anastasia doesn't break from the old that much. It has some spectacular special effects. There's way too much singing in this movie. But overall, it doesn't do it too badly. They could've gotten rid of the whole supernatural aspect of this movie, and spent time showing the two heroes, Vladmir and Dmitri, trying to train a very rough Anastasia on the ways of being a presentable royal lady. But they totally ignore this aspect of the story. It could've been good for some laughs.",Anastasia
55,matlefebvre20,An excellent historical animated musical,6,23 September 2006,"In a market so outrageously dominated by Disney, ""Anastasia"" appears as some kind of lifebelt for other animation studios.With a price-tag of over $50 million, ""Anastasia"" is a costly, very ambitious animated musical but it never gets pretentious about his family-pleasing issues or its historical depictions. And that's why it works so well.One of the few family-oriented animated movies depicting historical characters (something that Disney do not dare to do), ""Anastasia"" begins in 1916, where we meet young Russian princess Anastasia who gets a special gift from her grandmother, the Dowager Empress, during a prestigious royal party.Celebrations are abruptly shortened when cruel charlatan Rasputin takes profit of the party to set off his curse upon the Romanov family. Every historical buff knows what happens next: the Bolcheviks take upon the power and recall the country the USSR, but as it's a family movie, it attempts to make the viewer believe that the Russian Revolution is caused by Rasputin's curse.Anastasia is removed from her grandmother and ends up in a orphanage where she lives for ten years. She then encounters Dimitri and his companion Vlad who decide to guide her to Paris in order to find back her family.The historical and political contexts would never have been part of a Disney movie. But the production team of Fox Animation Studios do a terrific job with them. It never gets too complicated for the young or even the older viewers and it never gets too simplistic for the educated minds. We see men wearing caps with the hammer-and-sickle logo and we see Soviet passports, while we never get too deep with that. Except for that lovely quote: ""That's what I hate about this government. Everything's red."" But we hardly see red in this movie. Animation is sometimes half-satisfying but the animators never try to be minimalistic. This is particularly evident when you watch a scene such as the initial party in the St. Petersburg palace. Only a fraction of the people present in the background do appear alive while the others are simply still shadows or drawings. But in a live-action movie, that kind of scene would have requested hundreds and hundreds of extras and a very expensive set.And with the quality of the animation, we could really feel ourselves in pre-Depression Russia, German countryside and fantastic Paris. The feelings of the 1920s are very present until we arrive in Paris. Once in the City of Light, some of the places look too much modern, such as that Chanel store in a paved street. It feels too much anachronistic, even if it's well drawn.Three main action sequences are also included. Primo, there is the doomed train ride where Rasputin's evil 'spirits' attack in the snowy forest. I couldn't stop myself from watching the sparks flying, the fire invading the locomotive and the explosion at the end of the sequence.Second, the boat 'rescue' where reality is mixed with Anastasia's childish dream world until she's saved by Dimitri.And third, the climatic confrontation between the two main protagonists and the dismembering half-dead Rasputin. The dizzying moves and the animation techniques employed give an almost-real mood to the action.Those three sequences have something in common: they're all adrenaline performances that will satisfy the action-hungry viewer and they're all gentle enough to fit with young children. The case of the stone winged horse at the end is questionable but the rest isn't.What definitely makes ""Anastasia"" a children's movie is the abundance of musical numbers. And while there isn't any song that will become a part of legend, the overall score is enjoyable enough. But, instead of forcing itself to look like a typical Disney musical, the production team seems to care more about the story and the animation, which is a wise move because of the great storyline.The movie ""Anastasia"" could be compared to Lenin: it's the leader of the people against the supreme ruler (Nicholas II for Lenin, Disney for ""Anastasia). I don't say that for looking anti-Disney though. And with the amount of computer-animated movies made recently, ""Anastasia"" is one of the greatest late entries of the traditionally-animated movies. Da!",Anastasia
56,Cylex,Spectacular in every sense.,10,12 August 2001,"From start to finish, I was held spellbound. Great cast, well developed characters, stunning imagery, memorable songs, good story.

You'll never see anything like it again.  10/10",Anastasia
57,ikrani,It's not Historically Accurate to Have a Talking Bat or an Undead Rasputin,10,20 September 2014,"If you HONESTLY think that this movie's going to be historically accurate, think again. Aside from the points in the title of this review, in real life Anastasia died with the rest of the Romanov family on July 17, 1918 in Ekaterinburg, Russia when they were all shot by order of Vladimir Lenin himself. So any and all criticisms about the historical inaccuracy of the film are ultimately superfluous.Harsh reality aside, this animated adaptation of the 1956 film of the same name holds up pretty well after all these years. The story of a young girl being picked up by con men who want to pass her off as the Duchess and claim the Tsar's fortune is nothing new. But Don Bluth and crew manage to make it surprisingly refreshing with some bright colors, fun characters, mild but tense action scenes, and one of the most perfect love stories I've seen. Heck, the romantic leads don't even say ""I love you"" once; they leave it entirely up to the animation, the music, and the superb voice acting. THAT is what film is supposed to be: showing instead of telling.The characters are great, better than some in the Disney movies this film borrows from. Anastasia herself is a wide-eyed but hopeful woman whose banter with Dmitri, a con man who's afraid of admitting he's not such a bad guy after all, is the best part of the movie. Vlad is a lovable yet hopeless romantic, thus the perfect best friend for Dmitri. Angela Lansbury as The Dowager Empress Marie is, well, Angela Lansbury. Nothing that new, but NEVER anything bad.And then we have Christopher Lloyd as Rasputin. He's... 50/50. Sometimes I buy him as this hate-filled, despicably evil sorcerer, other times my mind momentarily flashes to Christoper Lloyd in a recording booth. And most of his scenes are plagued by Bartok the Bat, voiced by Hank Azaria. Bartok's not annoying or anything, but given that he does all of ONE thing in the film, his presence is no doubt due to the producers feeling that Rasputin and his awesome villain song were too scary. Gee, a villain that scares people? UNACCEPTABLE!Aside from ""In the Dark of the Night,"" the rest of the songs in the movie aren't that memorable. They're not BAD songs by any stretch, they just don't go as far with the lyrics or the tune as Rasputin's villain song. The only one I remember distinctly was Once Upon a December, and only by name. But, seriously, why isn't David Newman getting more work these days? His score in this film was spectacular, enough to give Alan Menken a run for his money.Overall, while it may not my favorite movie or the the BEST movie I've seen, there's nothing really to hate about this film. It was thoroughly entertaining from start to finish, and that's really all a movie needs to be.",Anastasia
58,amiranda-39274,Journey To the Past: Deep Analysis,8,8 December 2020,"I never saw Anastasia as a kid, which is a surprise, since i watched every other Don bluth animated film growing up, but i just watched it recently, so i feel i can review this movie without nostalgic glasses. let me just say I love this movie, its charming and is a fantastic tale, that left me wanting more.Story: For anyone who doesn't know Russian history, before the soviet union took over power, the Romanovs were the royalty in charge of Russia, until the revolution sadly ended all their lives and changed Russia forever. But a myth was spread that one daughter named Anastasia survived the massacre. This is a very likeable interpretation on what supposedly happened to Anastasia, the story is based off of the original play and movie starring Ingrid bergman and yurl bryner, but with drastic differences. A con man named dimitri wants to find a girl that resembles the long lost princess, and sell her back to Anastasia's grandmother the Duchess. He succeeds in finding a mysterious woman named Anya who has amnesia. They train her and prepare her to convince the duchess that she is the real Anastasia, but anya displays knowledge and memories that only the real Anastasia would know. Soooo. Honestly its not like they try to make it a big reveal to the audience that this is in fact the real Anastasia, but it is a glorious reveal for the characters. Despite this being a well done straightforward story. Someone decided that the movie needed a super villain, that villain is a zombie Rasputin that uses magic to try and kill anya on her journey to Paris. This is honestly the worst part of the movie and story, while i usually enjoy magic and these kind of villains in animated films, every scene that Rasputin is in, completely clashes with the overall story, and feels unneeded. In fact Anya never notices any of the supernatural forces trying to kill her on her journey until the ending. I believe the movie would have been much better without a villain, but if it needed one they could have just used KGB agents trying to get her. It doesn't ruin the movie, but it can weird you out and bring you out of the story.Characters: I love all the characters in this movie, everyone is so charming and funny. Anya is a great example of a independent gorgeous woman who is both a badass and feminine, her goal throughout the story is to discover her past, I usually don't like characters with amnesia but it was done well with anya. Dimitri is a likeable jerk, hes a funny guy, that goes through a great character arc, with the help of anya who he falls in love with. His partner Vlad is a loveable giant who is also a gentleman and ships anya and dimitri throughout the movie. Rasputin is a wacky but creepy villain, and while he is a decent villain, i still think he wasn't right for this movie. His little bat assistant Bartok, is enjoyable comic relief, enough that i enjoy his spin off movie. Ever voice actor really brings their character to life and fills them with personality, i think john cusack doing a whisper voice really makes dimitri more cool. And the dialogue is just so great and whitty, the banter is hilarious, and the serious conversations are well developed that i forge this is an animated movie sometimes.Romance: I have to say i wasn't expecting anya and dimitri romance to be so endearing in this film. It is that cliche ""they hate each other then love each other"" type, but its just so enjoyable, you can feel raw attraction between them, like in the scene where they dance for the first time, their relationship is so well developed that i personally feel this is one of the best animated romances ive ever seen, and i was very happy with their ending, which was very satisfying.Animation: The animation is great in this movie, but its also bipolar. What i mean by that is that there are many moments where the animation is inconsistent. Especially when it comes to the characters, their faces constantly change, and can look kind of off putting most of time (dimitri). While i enjoy the realistic human look of the characters, it can lead to uncanny valley at first. But i would say when the journey begins to paris, the animation stays the most consistent and looks similair to the disney style. The back grounds are wonderful, when you see the snow, you can feel the cold, every building looks glorious and full of atmosphere, especially in the palace. Speaking of which when anya sings 'once upon a December"", i experience the chills when the phantoms of the ballroom begin to dance around her, this scene is so fantastic and mesmerizing, that i have to watch it more than once. The CGi is the most inconsistent in this movie, while its not completely noticeable, the music box and moving statues can be strange to look at, but most of the time the cgi does add to the animations favor.Music: The songs are glorious, its no wonder this is now a Broadway shows, every song Liz callaway sings is almost supernaturally good. Despite not liking Rasputin in this movie his song "" In the dark of night"" is deliciously evil and flamboyant. The montage song ""you can learn to do it"" is so much fun, and does a great job of telling the story quickly and effectively. But the score is magnificent, the scene with the phantom ballroom is like listening to the angels quire, and the scene at the end with anya and dimitris kiss is also magnificent and fills me with so much love for this movie.This movie fills me with nostalgia that i should have, perhaps it was my love for Don Bluths films that gives me this melancholy feeling. I desperately desire a return to 2d animation, and watching movies like this, that i didn't see as a kid, reinforces that. This movie is so enjoyable, that by the end you want to see more of the characters, but sadly a sequel was never made. And despite the historical inaccuracy, i really don't care ,because this movie got me interested in the Romanov family and the real Anastasia, and i feel this movie did its job right. Ive already shown this movie to my family, and they all loved it, and if you haven't watched it yet, I hope you will love it too.""Its the perfect ending"". ""No. Its a perfect beginning"".",Anastasia
59,cyberknight,Stop Singing!,1,24 February 2007,"When I first watched this movie, I hated it. No, not because of what everybody seems so concerned with, the ""historical facts"". I don't care about the historical facts, there are no such things! History is truly written by the winners, and thus, it is completely partial, what means there are no ""facts"", just filtered and prejudiced points of view, not to mention that it's impossible to know everything of anything, much less to express all of it with our imperfect symbolic languages and media. Also, everything is relative, it's impossible to see clearly from the inside, and as part of this universe, no one will ever be able to see ""The Truth"" of anything (well, maybe jumping out of the universe using a transdimensional hyperdrive, but I doubt any organic creature could survive the quantum leap...) In other words, asking for a movie to be ""faithful"" to partial and, mostly, useless ""historical facts"" is just plain dumb. If you believe the TV news are closer to History than, say, the Greek Mythology, then I know who to blame for Bushit's incoming apocalypse.Anyway, what really got on my nerves was the characters' singing! Well, no, I didn't know it was a musical until it was too late, nobody warned me! I wouldn't have minded for a song or two, but there were so many of them! The beginning is wonderful, captivating. The details of the scenario, the quality of the painting, the design of the characters, I liked everything. Then, suddenly, they stopped acting and started singing! And after they had started, they wouldn't stop! There are no more than a few minutes of acting before they start another song! And the songs are awfully boring!The result is that, after an hour of movie or so, I started turning the volume down every time they were singing (the songs didn't add anything to the story, anyway). I watched all Fred Astaire's movies, I love ""Singing in The Rain"", so I usually don't have a problem with musicals, but I couldn't cope with ""Anastasia""! Please, don't judge the movie for its factoids, because it's not a National Geographic documentary. Be warned, though, that it's a (boring) musical, there is not much story in the plot (it would be an excellent 30min short-movie if the songs were cut off).",Anastasia
60,zactac,One of the best animated movies I've ever seen.,10,5 February 2010,"In Anastasia you expect there to be a few musical numbers, a battle of good and evil, and romance. Well there is that but, it comes out so beautifully to where this doesn't even feel like an animated movie. It feels more real than you'd ever expect from an animated movie like this.Anastasia is a movie about a girl named Anya who lost nearly all of her memory about her past and her family. Now with the help of a con-man named Dimitri shes going to Paris to learn the truth about her past. While on this journey an evil sorcerer (who's the reason her family died in the first place) is out bring an end to the Romanav line forever. So as Dimitri and Anya grow closer to learning the truth about her past they must also make a difficult choice about what to do as they begin to fall in love.Anastasia is a movie that just about the entire family will enjoy. It is light-hearted, filled with laughter, beautiful music that will make you want to dance and sing, and adventure to keep you excited throughout the film. This is a film I recommend to everyone who wants to find good whole-some family entertainment to watch, because Anastasia is perfect for that very reason.",Anastasia
61,NicolasCostoglou,Once upon a time in Russia...,10,30 June 2017,"I'm a big Fan of Don Bluth, and i just recently got to see Anastasia for the first time (well, completely at least) and hell yeah, like i expected from Bluth, this was an awesome ride...Don Bluth is famous for being rebellious and making movies which look like Disney at first sight, but are way more dark and not as naively fairy-tale-like, and Anastasia proofs that again.It seems at first to be like Cinderella (which is played in a theater in the movie...interesting ^^), or other Disney-Princess-movies, but oh man, it get's intensely dark and that fairly quick.But first the real important things: This movie looks beautiful, the animation of the characters is fluid, the interaction between them full of energy, the camera perspectives (and movements, something incredibly hard to do well in animation) are fantastic and the mix of 2D and 3D animation is perfect. My favourite animated film of all time is Bluths next project Titan A.E. which does all of this things as good (and some even better), but the scope and feel of this fairy tale is very different, from the (intense and awesome) space adventure.Also a trademark of Bluths films is the use of music to get the story going, and to make dramatic moments even more dramatic (sometimes kinda over-the-top even), and this film has great songs and a outstanding (Oscar nominated) score.I already talked briefly about the energetic interactions between the characters, but i have to point out how great the protagonists are, Anastasia is a strong (at first a bit naive, but then bad ass) character, Dimitri is also great, and the antagonist Rasputin is creepy and evil as fu**.The movie also has a great sense of comedy, i watched it alone and had to laugh out loud a few times actually (and ""awwed"" at the visuals a few time, also a rare reaction when i'm alone ^^ Even Rasputins little minion-bat is fairly funny and not as annoying as i, at first, anticipated)Not to mention that Bluth is very good in constructing intense action-sequences and they are few, but excellent. The scene with the train is surprisingly well ""shot"" and choreographed, and i love that Anastasia is the one defeating Rasputin in the end, his death is glorious...All in all, (and i'm surprised myself) my favourite ""Princess-fairy- tale""-movie i've seen to date...",Anastasia

63,m-ozfirat,Can be concluded with one word Superficial,4,11 October 2017,The phenomena that a Romanov princess survived the October Revolution has captured the public imagination through out the 20th Century that a member survived and lived in secrecy. Despite this being doubtful the story does have potential as a film but one not done in Disney style but in a serious manner without songs or a frivolous story line. The only advantage of this film was that it had potential the rest of the film is just plain silly for an audience. The film in my view should of used the 1956 Yul Brynner film as a guide and adapted it to animation. The characters are too stereotypical and wooden with clichés but at least they got one thing right the ethnic representations. Despite the history this should be only side show and concentrated on an adventure story without Rasputin as an antagonist going to much in to fantasy. Another flaw with this film is that it follows a judgemental pattern when discussing the Tsar who is always viewed as a Martyr in the Western media and the Anastasia myth is one that compels people to say that the Communists criminals lost and the innocent Tsar did not die in vain. In reality the Tsar was a weak ruler with an arrogant wife who lived in luxury whilst his people starved and kept his people back with medieval practices. Defenders of his will always point to the Duma however this was only a representative the Tsar still had absolute power no matter how many able rulers came before Nicholas II - absolute responsibility who paid the absolute price. Because the order that replaced him was Socialist that the Tsar is revered in cinema as the October revolution gave the Capitalist system a run for its money through out the 20th century but then I must be a hypocrite to deny American Cold war aggression and policy which is what its all about.,Anastasia
64,StartingAllOver14,A epic and decent rival film to Disney,6,2 May 2010,"""Anastasia"" isn't Don Bluth's first attempt to compete with Disney, but it's certainly one of the most epic ones. While the movie was heavily hyped back in 1997 to be a really competitor to the Disney film, it certainly had the same feel and tone as a Disney classic. However, in spite of that component being a strength, ""Anastasia"" is still watchable on it's own merits, but it's still hampered by some flaws which makes the hype unnecessary.As with Richard Rich's ""Swan Princess"" from 1994, ""Anastasia"" is more or less as watching a Disney film without the famous and promoted Disney logo appearing on its opening. Ironically, the creators of ""Anastasia"" followed the same habit as Disney by making a film based on grave, historical events, turning back to it's accuracy and rather focused on the legend. Sounds like a part of the typical Disney-formula, but even for a non-Disney film, the many components of the formula actually works on this film.Most of the time, ""Anastasia"" provides as a cute and charming flick, filled with catchy Broadway songs by Stephen Flaherty/Lynn Ahrens, which actually sounds like they could been on a Disney flick and a decent score by David Newman. Anastasia herself, wonderfully voiced by Meg Ryan and nicely sung by Liz Callaway, is a surprisingly spunky and funny heroine, with a personality who outshines the Disney heroines. While her love interest Dimitri, despite his sex appeal, is less interesting, he's given a solid voice by John Cusack, which shares a good chemistry with Ryan's voice. Kelsey Grammar is endearing as Dimitri's sidekick Vladimir, Bernadette Peters is charming as the Empress cousin Sophie, while Angela Landsbury provides a great performance as The Empress.With the exception of some badly drawn townspeople, the animation is lush and gorgeous, especially on the palaces and the architecture. The film opens with a dynamic and exciting action sequence and most of the action scenes are like that. Although some of the lines are a bit clichéd, the characters has a few amusing comments along the way.""Anastasia's"" flaws ultimately lies in it's predictability. Even for a kid movie, the story has no surprising twist and turn. The film becomes a bit sappy and boring during it's third act. While the villain Rasputin does provide some of the exciting scenes, he still comes off as a less compelling villain compared to the Disney baddies. His sidekick, Bartok the bat, has some amusing moments (and it's brilliantly voiced by the recognizable Hank Azaria), but still doesn't become the charming villain sidekick that he could have been. And the predictable love story between Anastasia and Dimitri feels as a forced and rushed, in spite of the lovebirds shares a good chemistry.Those components prevents ""Anastasia"" to live up to it's full potential. However, the film still makes a watchable and entertaining effort for both kids and adults. While this film may not be one of the best animated movies ever made, it still is a worthy competitor to Disney and demonstrates an art-form that nowadays is considered as rare.",Anastasia
65,CatfishOpinions,best disney movie and it ain't even disney,8,30 April 2020,The animation is so good. The casting is so good. This movie has maybe the best romantic chemistry I've ever seen in a traditionally-animated movie. Dimitri is a dreamboat. The songs s l a p. I love this movie. Way underrated.,Anastasia
66,thrwmbsbgkdoepmcjrmrdw,Cool movie,8,27 January 2008,I thought it was really cute. They did a pretty good ob to keeping with the stories we have all heard about the real Anastasia. The characters are well developed. The actors are well matched to each character to what goes well and flows with the movie. Though I do wish that in animated movies they wouldn't make the girls so skinny. Add a little meat to their bones.Not just little kids will enjoy this. When I first saw this movie I was 13. And now at 23 I still enjoy it. It is a movie all ages will love and enjoy. It is a worth while movie to see. So gather round your family and make it a fun filled evening by popping in this movie.,Anastasia
67,ridiculonius,Wonderfully Entertaining,10,26 September 2008,"Probably one of the best cartoon tales ever, 'Anastasia' is funny, exciting, romantic, and just plain awesome.The movie follows the story of Anya (Meg Ryan), an orphan who received amnesia from hitting her head when she was eight years old, with only a strange and beautiful necklace as a clue to her past. As the pendant has the sentence 'together in Paris' on it, Anya concludes that her family must reside in France, and so hooks up with two con men, Dimitri (John Cusack) and Vladimir (Kelsey Grammar), who decide to pass her off as the lost Romanov princess Anastasia to swindle the Dowager Empress (Angela Lansbury) out of the reward she has offered for her granddaughter's safe return. What the conniving pair and orphaned urchin don't realize is that Anya *is* Anastasia, and her family's undead confidant Rasputin (Christopher Lloyd) is bent on destroying her, and so eradicating the Romanov line forever.What a brilliant tale this is! Who cares if it isn't historically accurate? It's not meant to be, and there are quite a few little historical details anyways, like the paintings, and physical similarities between the cartoon characters and the real people (like the ghost of Anastasia's little brother Alexi walks with a limp, etc). It's meant to be a fantasy, a bit of wishful thinking. And there have been other takes on this story, so why bash this one?As well as this, the songs are extraordinary. 'Once Upon a December' still sends shivers down my spine even after all these years of being a steadfast fan of the film--even as a teenager I catch myself humming the tunes of 'Journey to the Past', 'In the Dark of the Night', 'Rumour in St Petersburg', and especially the uber-catchy 'Paris Holds the Key (To Your Heart)'. The humour and romance walk hand in hand with this one--though a lot of the laughs come out of the wicked Rasputin (only amusing because he's falling apart) and his bat side-kick Bartok (voiced by The Simpsons' Hank Azaria, so he's automatically hilarious), the funniest parts of the movie (I think) are generated by the bantering relationship between Dimitri the con-man and Anya/Anastasia. They are constantly arguing and insulting each other, even when faced with mortal peril, which makes their 'unspoken attraction' (as Dimitri's partner Vladimir calls it) even more adorable and real-seeming. All in all, 'Anastasia' may not be the perfect film, and sure it isn't historically accurate, but it is superb all the same!",Anastasia
68,Norway1,Top-Notch Romantic-Comedy-Musical,8,20 October 1998,"Hats off to Don Bluth! This one takes the cake. Never before has he scored so big as with this Major motion picture (this is his first picture to actually make a profit). I love it! From the very first song it had me hooked. The music is masterful and the art could EASILY be mistaken for Disney: It is superb! I was totally surprised in a good way. The Music is absolutely memorable and catchy. It's one of the few out there with a Soundtrack worth purchasing. I hope there comes many more with calibre equal to this. Though there remains a vivid fear: The sequel will most likely be a low-budget dirct-to-video sorry excuse for a...and NOT include Bluth's name.

I was a child whence I first saw this film, and was intrigued and learned the words to every song, falling in love with them more and more as I grew up. Thank goodness that I held on to loving this movie, never to forget it, because it seems that nowadays the things that once meant so much to an audience is diminishing to clichéd moments of over-told and repetitive story lines that make no use of character development to further interest the audience, or the use of imagination to create something memory-worthy, when you look back to think about it, you think three words... that was amazing. This is a movie that if you saw it as a child, rekindles something in you that throws you back into that moment you first saw it when you watch it again once you've grown up, if that makes sense. It's just a movie you can't outgrow because it holds something for all ages. I'd recommend this movie to anyone looking for an escape from the new ""modern"" garbage animated films that are invading the art of film and destroying the concept of what a movie truly is.",Anastasia

71,TheOneManBoxOffice,"Far from historically accurate, but still a good family flick.",8,13 August 2016,"In the late 1990s, we had two animated movies that were based on a certain event in a country's history. In 1995, Disney gave us an American ""history lesson"" (and I use that term loosely) with Pocahontas, but in 1997, 20th Century Fox did exactly what Disney did, except give us a look at a bit of Russian history (again, using the term ""history"" loosely) about the daughter of Czar Nicholas II, Anastasia Romanov, simply called...well...Anastasia. However, one thing to consider when going into this film is that this is a family picture (""kids movie"" for short), so if you're looking for a true-to-life history lesson a la a PBS or History Channel documentary, you might as well throw that out the nearest airlock.In this film, Anastasia, voiced by Meg Ryan, is a princess that went missing for several years after the attack on the Romanov family during a party, which was led by the Romanov's former confidant Rasputin, voiced by Christopher Lloyd of Back to the Future fame, who is an undead, evil sorcerer in this movie. Anastasia, now with a case of amnesia and dubbed Anya, eventually joins two con men, Dimitri (John Cusack) and Vladimir (Fraiser's Kelsey Grammar), who are convinced that she really is the missing Romanov princess, and travel to Paris, France, where her grandmother, the Dowager Empress, resides, to hopefully reunite them, all while Rasputin is seeking her unfortunate demise.I won't judge this movie on historical accuracy, as all (or most) of us can tell that the general audience for this film is younger children, though adult audiences will also be entertained, since there was a lot of effort put into the creation of this film. That, and I wouldn't dismiss it as a ""Disney knockoff"" right away, because the directors of the film, Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, were former Disney animators, so it's easy to confuse this for a Disney picture like Beauty and the Beast. As a family film alone, it is pretty damn good. The artwork and animation is great, the songs are enjoyable, and the voice acting is pretty decent.The film was such a success that it became co-director Don Bluth's comeback after a slew of mediocre to bad animated films he directed throughout most of the decade, and his highest grossing film to date. Not only that, but it warranted a direct-to-video follow up film starring the villain's sidekick, Bartok the Bat (voiced by The Simpsons' Hank Azaria in both films).Overall, the film serves as a great choice to have playing during a family movie night, unless you're extremely picky on historical accuracy, in which case, go do something else for 97 minutes.",Anastasia

I don't know why people don't give good enough rating for this movie ( maybe because it's different from it real story or because the story it's not quite deep? i don't know since, i don't read the history. Even though it is different from the real story, we should keep in mind that this movie is a fantasy movie not a biographical one. It is targeted for younger audiences, so you can't blame the writer to imbued the story with magical things ).As a kid, i watched this movie as a love story when a lost princess who tried to get what has been lost and found much more precious things along the way.The story line is quite simple ( and i do not know that this movie is based on true story, up until now ). It's a story about Anna, how was growing as an orphan, not knowing or remember who she is. Then someday, she went on a journey with 2 man, Dimitri and Vladimir ( and a dog ) to find her real identity. Fantasy, Love, Adventure, History,you can find thus mix of feelings in this movie.

The quality of the animation is fairly average but the characters are well developed. The story is about a young orphaned girl (Anya), whose dream is to have an identity and a home. On the road of twisting options and possibilities, she takes a stop into the lives of two witty conmen, Dmitri and Vladimir. They make her consider the possibility that she is the infamous long lost Princess Anastasia, daughter of Empress Marie. You can't blame them, because she strongly resembles this beautiful duchess and only remembers small bits and pieces of her past. Proud of his polite persuasion (most of the time he's ""bossy""), Dmitri thinks that he's finally on his way to earning a lot of money, until he falls in love with herWhat unwinds from here, are some desperate murder attempts on Anya by the funnily evil Rasputin (well voiced by Christopher Lloyd), and some truths soon to be exposed, as Anya bridges the gap between past and present.",Anastasia

75,erose001,A great movie for adults to watch with older kids,10,1 December 2000,"My 11-year-old daughter and I watched *Anastasia* together and enjoyed ourselves immensely.  The color was lush, much of the animation was excellent (almost Disney-quality), the music was enjoyable, and the voice talent was fantastic.The fact that it is historical fantasy was not a problem, because it prompted my daughter to ask relevant questions about the history behind the story, and then want to go get out the Encarta to learn more about what really happened during the Russian Revolution.  This is why myth and legend is so important in any culture, and the writers of this movie did a fine job of highlighting the mythological elements of this story without disrespecting the history behind it.My daughter, who is old enough to sneer at her younger sisters' infatuation with Barney and Sesame Street, sighed at the first song, thinking - as I did - that this would be another example of a sappy kids' song interrupting the story rather than moving it along.  We were both pleasantly surprised. She also commented that she thought the ""scary"" aspects of the story - including life & death action moments and a particularly evil villain - might be troubling for very small children, but she handled it fine (as would any child over eight or nine, I think, as long as a trusted adult is watching too).  And the anachronistic but snappy 1997 dialogue with its facetious humor helped to keep this adult engaged and amused.  Meg Ryan, John Cusack, and Angela Lansbury were fun, but Kelsey Grammer and Hank Azaria IMO stole the show.  Both were so ""in character"" that I didn't place their voices until halfway through the movie, and didn't even mind that niggling feeling you get when you hear a voice you recognize but can't identify.One final comment, which my daughter made me promise to include, and that is that she wonders why with such beautiful color, the animators chose that lackluster yellow for Anastasia's gown in the final, climactic scene.

78,Oriel,A classic for all ages,9,17 March 1999,"Let others carp about the disservices to history:  this Anastasia rises above its flaws to offer an engaging, emotionally resonant story of a girl's search for identity.  Within its historical, quasi-factual context, the film presents a situation almost everyone can relate to--that of trying to find one's place in the world.  Orphaned Anya's quest for her past (and, consequently, her future) strikes universal emotional chords:  singing ""Journey to the Past,"" she sets out with both trepidation and hope to find her identity and her place in the world.  The haunting, poignant ""Once Upon a December"" sequence, one of the finest scenes in any recent film, is unforgettable, as we watch Anya's yearnings take the form of a ghostly dance with memories of a vanished life.  And the final reunion where hostility melts gradually into acceptance, is one of the most moving and satisfying moments in film. Everything about the film bespeaks loving attention and quality:  the magnificent animation and design re-create lavish Russian and Parisian locations (complete with recognizable artworks and cameos by celebrities of the '20s), and the screenplay balances action, humor, and genuine emotion. Villain Rasputin is clearly aimed at children, and some of the repartee between Anya and unlikely hero Dimitri may seem jarringly anachronistic, but viewers of any age should still enjoy this timeless coming-of-age story.",Anastasia
79,ObscureAuteur,"Utter trash - well made, well acted wrapper around garbage",2,2 April 2006,"Animated children's movies should really stick to real fairy tales rather than manufacturing them out of grim novels and grimmer history. Making a fairy tale out of one of the grimmest of twentieth century events and completely destroy any resemblance to well documented history is a crime against history, its victims and the children it grossly misinforms. Rasputin was not a supernatural evil wizard/demon. He was killed before the revolution. He had no part in the murder/assassination of the Romanov's or Anastasia's fate. Where is the Leninist terror? Where is the truth about what happened to Anastasia's family, even if even now no one can be completely sure about Anastasia herself? This movie is being made in an era when the Anastasia/Anna Andersen hoax on which the Bergman movie was based has been exposed via genetic testing. There is no excuse for cluttering children's minds with such nonsense given the cruel brutal facts of history.This is not a classic fairy tale, nor a bible epic, it is just a really contemptible idea for an entertainment vehicle. There is also no reason it could not be translated to a fiction time and place without connection to actual events and then be a successful movie without the baggage.What's next?The happy holocaust survivor a la ""Life is Beautiful"" complete with singing, dancing camp inmates, and humorous bumbling guards? And perhaps big smiling ovens!How about the adventures of a sweet young thing with a big princess attitude that barely got out of the World Trade Center with her hunky young hero just before a giant flying demon Bin Laden reduces the buildings to rubble with blast of his powerful satanic breath?Rating of 2 is for the unquestionably good looking product and the work of the voice actors that was wasted on it, leaving some room at the bottom for totally unredeemable works.The movies should stick to established fairy tales, and leave making up modern ones to politicians and their spin doctors, for example: We come as liberators, that's why we are building a dozen or two permanent bases in your country!",Anastasia

She aint as badass as Mulan, She never created a whole social status as Lady Marian and of course she´s not Mary Poppins Y´all
To me the explanation of this dull and numb film is just simple fanservice to the figure of Don Bluth the broken idol, the ozymandias, the chosen one with the power to take over Disney....But with Anastasia, Bluth hasn´t done nothing more than becoming Disney, the same thing he wanted to destroy.Anastasia is not underrated, is overrated and all of this is because of the Don Bluth´s fanbase, and the ""freshness"" of showing ""new"" things on an animated princess pick.

I really like this film and probably always will. I know the true story about what happened. When I consider the two even though the movie shares the name I consider the movie and the true story two completely different things. True children that see this movie are in no way getting the truth but why would they want it. Don Bluth obviously never meant for it to be like that. My opinion, considering the subject manner and what he was trying to do I'd say he did a really good job. If children really want to know the truth behind the movie I suggest they look it up when they get older. Either get mad from it or not I think Don Bluth did a really good job on a story so tragic.

The long list of historical lies includes 1) The Romanovs celebrated the 300th anniversary of the dynasty in 1913, and they did NOT throw a ball. 2)Anastasia was 16 in the year the movie starts in. 3) The Tsar abdicated before the Revolution even happened, and went through a long imprisonement periodbefore he was secretly executed. 4) Rasputin was murdered long before therevolution. But to give such a lie as to say that Anastasia WAS found, THAT is inexcusable. Why FOX would remake the 1950's film is nothing short of baffling. They attempt to turn it into another silly children's quest movie. And they even fail at that!

83,pachin,The Greatest Animated Film ever!,10,21 December 2002,"I truly believe Anastasia is the Greatest Animated Film ever! The main characters have very enjoyable, with wonderful dialogue plus witty banter quite reminiscent of some the finest romantic movie comedies. Warning: Possible spoilers. Let me start out by writing that Anastasia is a wonderful FILM, not just a wonderful animated film.Forget about whether the movie is historically accurate. It is after all a fantasy but within this fantasy you can actually believe that it is feasible. This is a movie that I can see being played by a young Meg Ryan, a young John Cusack and of course Kelsey Grammar who does a superb job as Vladimir who is one of the two con artists in the movie along with Cusack's character Dimitri.The plot is that the young Anastasia survived the attack on the Russian Royal family but was believed to been dead all these years. Her grandmother, the Dowager Empress Marie, played by the wonderful Angela Lansbury offers a huge reward for the return of her beloved granddaughter. Two con artists, Dimitri (voiced by John Cusack) and Vladimir (voiced by Kelsey Grammar) decided to hired a ""fake"" Anastasia to cheat the Dowager of her money. By coincidence they stumble upon the real Anastasia who is suffering from amnesia. They train her to pretend to be Anastasia not knowing she is the real Anastasia.Anastasia is a very strong young woman who can fend for herself. Even though the movie is set in the past she is the epitome of the independent modern woman of today.The strength of the movie in my opinion is the wonderful dialogue and banter between the characters. There are great subtle touches in the movie. The characters expressions during many scenes indicate the emotions of the individual characters at that moment in time. I found the characters to be very real considering the situation they are in. You don't find this very often in many movies, much less animated movies.It's a beautiful looking movie but the dialogue and music is so good that I don't have to see the movie to enjoy it.The voice cast is a who's who's of Hollywood with people like Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammar, Christopher Lloyd, Angela Lansbury, Hank Azaria and even a young Kirsten Dunst. They work together almost flawlessly. You wonder how good a real life feature film would have made if the same cast was used. Obviously I do mean a younger Meg Ryan and John Cusack at the appropriate ages.The singing talents are excellent with Liz Callaway (the singing voice of Anastasia) doing a superb job as she always does, Jonathan Dokuchitz (singing voice of Dimitri) also doing an excellent job. Angela Lansbury, Bernadette Peters and Lacey Chabert do a fine job. Kelsey Grammar is also surprisingly good in doing his own singing.

However, to make a children's movie out of the monumental tragedy of the Russian revolution is something entirely new in the annals of history.  We may safely leave aside the historical factors, such as Rasputin becoming an enemy of the Romanov family, such as the Romanovs being good and well beloved rulers, such as the Dowager Empress, Maria Fedorovna being a gentle and kindly woman (known as Dagmar the Furious in her native Denmark) and such other petty nonsense. But to make of this historical event a children's story, to make of it an industry of children's books, clothes, games, music, shoes etc . . . that is unforgivable?  Won't the blood splash when they walk in those shoes?  What are we to expect next?  An interactive children's game called ""Death Camp"" with little figures in striped uniforms running away from teeny-little German shepherds? Who knows.  Now, over eighty years later it will, perhaps, be possible to forgive the makers of that revolution.  But it is impossible to forgive the foul scum who did not even pause before making a cake out of the monstrous mix of ash and blood, who did not stop in their cynicism and made a game out of the most tragic event of the twentieth century, and the one that spawned all others, including WWII and the Holocaust.

The musical numbers were better than a disney movie.  The characters were, for the most part, enjoyable.  There is a warning on this movie though.  If you are a parent don't be fooled by this ""G"" rating.  The evil character Rasputin was played and charactistics of Satin himself.  I must admit if I were a child I would have been frightened by some scenes.  One in particular Anastasia was having a nightmere that seemed all too real to me.  All in all for young adults this was a great movie.",Anastasia
91,Ebo,The next best thing to being Walt Disney,5,28 November 1998,"This is the best Disney animation imitation I've seen.  I enjoyed it more than The Lion King, though less than, say, Beauty and the Beast or Hunchback of Notre Dame.  Highlights included excellent voice casting -- Meg Ryan, Christopher Lloyd, John Cusack, and especially Kelsey Grammer and Hank Azaria -- and animation every bit as good as any Disney film.  It only falls short in music:  the songs aren't up to Disney standard.  I won't be humming any of them an hour after the movie is over.  Still, a fun film, and by no means a waste of time.",Anastasia

Just some accents would have been enough. and no real convincing idea of the Russian setting or communism rising up as it should have done. I know this isn't Doctor Zhivago but there should have been at least SOME idea that the Bolsheviks were rising up.Romanticism was obvious but then again...it's entirely fictional and thus able to do what you want with it.I also read the original script and thought that some opportunities to make it a little bit more interesting were lost such as:1. Proper references to Bolshevism 2. Cameos from Stanislavski and Yuri Zhivago.However, the look was good, it was enjoyable and the animation was impressive, especially since it was one of the last hand drawn animations to come out from Disney.",Anastasia

94,drchazan,Anesthesia Required,1,6 February 2003,"When this movie came out, my kids made me take them to see it. Knowing the story before hand, I was wary of going in the first place. I mean, really! Why take such a tragic and controversial story and turn it into a light-hearted film? For this same reason, I have refused to go see many of the more recent Disney animated films. Little did I know that I was going to see an animated film that made even the worst of Disney's animated ""classics"" look flawless.Perhaps the biggest problem with this movie is that it isn't a Disney movie at all.  No, this one was made by 20th Century Fox, by the famous ex-Disney team of Don Bluth and Gary Goldman.  Unfortunately, without the heavy-weight comfort of Disney Studios to guide them, they ended up with a fumbling bit of work that has only the voice of Meg Ryan in the title role to give it any class whatsoever.We all know the story. A girl, who may be the only living heir to the Russian royal family after the revolution, tries to find out if she really is just that. Many versions of this story have been filmed in live action. Some better than others, but all point up the tragic mystery of the roots of an orphan. This film gives a happy ending where there is none. Granted, lots of the more recent Disney films have done the same. I believe that children should know that some stories don't have happy endings - or at least ones that have semi-happy endings, with a bittersweet after taste. One good example of this is Disney's ""Jungle Book"" where, although the child returns to live with humans, the animals who cared for him lose a friend.The difference here is that at least the Disney films have at least a few tolerable songs - some even memorable ones. Pocahontas is a good example of this. A truly tragic story, that at least had one excellent song to promote it. This film hasn't even that small claim to fame. So, my next ""thumb down"" goes to the score of this film. And I use that term lightly, since the music is one junk yard of forgetful tunes with overly sweet lyrics.The animation reminded me of early Disney films. Two dimensional characters on a background that tries to be three dimensional, but fails to make the grade. At least even the early Disney animators could make beautiful backgrounds for their films. You would have thought that animators would have learned by 1997 to give a bit more even look to these films. Disney has tried and, to some extent, succeeded. Not so here. So, where some animated films have a visual beauty to assist them, this one is lacking again.Finally, when one looks for a film to take their kids to, they want something that is entertaining but with at least some sort of a message. I still haven't figured out what kind of message this film sent my kids, and I certainly wasn't entertained.In sum, I wouldn't recommend this movie for either adults or children. There is nothing to recommend it. The story is badly distorted, the music doesn't grab your ears, the animation is third rate and it neither entertains nor teaches us anything. If you have to see this film - make sure you're brain dead first, and then, only take your youngest kids. They'll never know the difference. Or will they?",Anastasia
95,BIGMuzzy,Very funny where it ought not to be.,4,21 December 1998,"PROS (well, there are NOT very much of them):1. There are some funny episodes.CONS:1. Almost doesn't correspond to real history. And this is really funny (at first).2. Too much illogical links. For example, Anastasia's grandmother escaped from Russia with no luggage, but later we find out that she keeps family pictures in Paris. Another example: Anastasia leaves orphanage in new and clean clothes and has a GOLD MEDALLION on her neck!!! (Hm, it is DEFINITELY a FUNNY fairytale).3. 'Horror' parts of the film were too fearful for little children (though funny enough for adults).4. Part of the film was animated by computer... and the more I had looked at it, the more it irritated me. Especially moving cars; they looked just like toys. First, 3D-animation of 'Anastasia' stands out of 2D. Second, it is not high quality 3D. Think it would be much better if there were NOT 3D-animation at all.5. Not impressive storyline... well, to tell the truth, very standard storyline.6. Standard Hollywood film. Hey guys, Russians are NOT Americans, they talk different, do different. And they have another music! After 'Anastasia' I'm even afraid to watch 'Mulan' - I can imagine what Hollywood had left from China culture there!VERDICT:Bad film. Not terrible but just bad.",Anastasia
96,LeBallz,A Travesty of Historical Fiction,3,8 September 2019,"If a movie intends to profit off of historical figures and then fully doctors their history, what is the point? It is not ""dramatic license"" to use a real historical characters and then totally fabricate their experience. If I made an animated movie where Abraham Lincoln became an Olympic figure skater would you claim it as a movie ""just for children"" or a ""nice introduction to the history of Lincoln,"" no you would regard it as Anastasia should be, utter garbage.",Anastasia
97,charliote13,A Good Movie!!!!!,10,27 November 2007,As an avid Disney girl the movie Anastasia is one that will go in the record books because it broke box office records for the type of movie it was. The movie was one of the first of FOX Animation and the characters are lovable. Rasputin is not like a Jafar or Gaston in this movie because he is not competing for glory but for a way of revenge and endorfence. he sets up the story at the beginning so well it makes us fear him more. Even though Dimitri is not what you would find in a hero or protagonists he really knows what happened and is willing to do any thing to get the money. As in conclusion this movie is great and is attractive to girls of any age.,Anastasia

100,MattGrif,"Bland, insipid animation-by-numbers",2,21 June 2000,"If there is one medium that is so frequently guilty of mangling a perfectly good story, it is animation. This is not the prerogative of all animation, but ""Anastasia"" is, if anything, guilty to the last.Foregoing the film's decision to eschew historical accuracy (already well covered by other comments here), we are left with a movie that is practically barren of redeeming features. Though lushly designed, the animation throughout falls flat. The character animation is, for the most part, stilted and inexpressive, and sits awkwardly alongside the 3D computer animation. The all-star voice cast and often quite adept dialogue does little to rescue the faltering script, nor do the obligatory songs, which although can be fairly enjoyable, are eminently forgettable. Dredging further from the barrel of animation staple we are presented with cute animal mascots, and the ludicrous, utterly repellent villain figure of Rasputin, who is practically superfluous to the story's requirements.It is astounding that a film with so few redeeming qualities could have come from Don Bluth, the same stable that produced the darkly fantastical ""Secret of NIMH"" and the endearing ""An American Take"" films (arguably amongst Bluth's best work), but it just goes to show what can go wrong when someone tires of making films about talking mice.",Anastasia
101,tibercromwell,Best Fox Animated Feature Ever.,10,22 April 2016,"This is absolutely the best animated feature that I have ever seen in my entire life. I saw it many times, and I really love it! I've really got to say this. This is absolutely going for global warming in my country. Let's grade this right away. And as for Bartok. @&$^ you, Bartok. Animation: A- Characters: A Story: B+ For Kids: YEAH! Music: B Voice Acting: A Overall: A-. That's why I freaking love it. Wheeee- hoodoo.Oh. And Another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie, is that gender means very little. There are female characters like Anya and Sophie but you don't really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film. Due to this, there's also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age.All in all, Anastasia is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into traditional animations before Lilo and Stitch, Atlantis: The Lost Empire and The Princess and the Frog came out.",Anastasia
102,susansmoose,Anastasia,10,14 July 2012,"Let's put it this way. I am an adult who loves animation and this film does not disappoint. I saw it in the theater when it first came out and, even though it's not historically accurate, I loved it. I STILL love it and watch it every time it comes on cable as I am doing this minute.I saw the first Anastasia with Yul Brynner and Ingrid Bergman and I loved that one as well. We now know, thanks to DNA results that Anna Anderson was not the Grand Duchess Anastasia. We also know that Anastasia's remains were discovered. But it doesn't change the fact this film was well made, the music is catchy (especially Once Upon a December, my favorite song) and it has a happy ending.The cast is star studded, Meg Ryan as Anastasia, John Cusack as Dimitri, Kelsey Grammar as Vlad and Angela Lansbury as the Dowager Empress all voice their characters well. Christopher Lloyd as Rasputin and Hank Azaria as Bartok the bat are absolutely wonderful as the bad guys.When I watch or read any historical fiction, I always want to go and discover the truth about the main characters. This film is a perfect example of that. So even though it is historical inaccurate, what could be so wrong? There are books, articles and documentaries on the real Rasputin and the Romanovs which will lead everyone to the truth if interested. That's what historical fiction is all about in my opinion.Enjoy this wonderful film and forget that it's not historically accurate. It's great for kids and adults like me who love animated films. Hats off to Don Bluth for doing a fantastic job.Watch and enjoy.",Anastasia
103,Lahyte,Not Disney's best,6,22 August 2021,"Anastasia was great, but it doesn't flow as much as I had hoped. The numebers were okay, the villian song had potential, but was shallow. While it is refreshing to see a princess be naturally strong, Anastasia's relationship with Dimitri felt off. Their natual suspicion and dislike for each other was smooth, but the progression beyond this hurdle felt forced.Every classic Disney princess ends up in love and married. Anastasia would have worked either way. What she wanted was her past and family. The fact that they glossed over the death of her parents, (siblings?) and immediate relatives was strange. The focus on romatic love in that situation doesn't feel like a fairy tale.There were parts that were slow and awkward, such as the intersection between the city and fishing village. Plus, Dimitri had the music box, and noticed the special key around Anastasia's neck. Why didn't he put two and two together in his travel to Paris? Why place emphasis on a plot device that could have accelerated the search forward and not fully utilise it?The lack of wit from the characters made this movie feel flat to me. Had they gone a more thoughtful route and made Rasputin more relevant to the heroess, Anastasia would be more enjoyable now.",Anastasia

With some truly beautiful scenes and excellent music, this animated full-length feature sparkles and bubbles... but stereotypes fall in their usual places, and Anastasia is relatively ugly.  However, she is a real ""Meg Ryan"" role and does all the ""Meg Ryan"" things and her friends, enemies, add comedy, romance and fun to this lovely film.",Anastasia

The list of historical inaccuracies can, unfortunately, be made quite long. BUT! Disregard this and look at the film as a fairy tale or adventure instead. Then you have a great film with all the ingredients of a classic: Adventure, horror, comedy, romance, evolvment of characters, etc. and I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do. I won't grade it, since I'm lousy at that, but I'd urge anyone who's looking for the above mentioned features and more, to give this film a chance and be moved by it.",Anastasia
106,florrieprocter,Still the best animated movie,10,24 June 2019,"A lot of people criticise this movie for not being historically accurate, however I believe that doesn't matter. Since I was young this has been my favourite movie and despite it not being factual, it led me to having a curiosity in the actual history, and now I have many a book on the Romanovs and Russian revolutions. I believe this impact happened to many children growing up watching it. A film does not need to be accurate, (it is not a documentary) to be able to influence people to look into the history.
Furthermore, this film does not have one bad song or score. Once Upon a December is probably the most well known but every other song is incredibly entertaining and fun to listen to whilst also being performed extremely well by the talented voice actors.
Probably my most watched film to this day and will continue watching it with great passion.",Anastasia
107,snow-mblu,"A great animated kid's movie! it's darker than most Disney movies, original, and extremely funny.",10,3 July 2008,"Anastasia is a movie for everyone, but it was made for children! while commenting it, I can never forget that fact. I read some reviews that declared this movie was fantasy and unbelievable, so it deserved a bad review. I find that ridiculous! Obviously it's full of fantasy... it's a fairytale! Although it's based on the story of anastasia the Russian grand duchess, the movie does not try to be biographical... For gods sake, the villain is ""rotting"" during the entire movie!I think Anastasia is a great fairy tale movie. it's darker than most Disney movies, original, and extremely funny. You have romance, suspense and lots of jokes (especially with bartok the bat)! All a child can wish for, but the adults will also be entertained!The songs are sweet (I like journey to the past - great song) and the singers are amazing (the actor Kelsey Grammar, who gives voice to vladimir, sings himself and he has an amazing voice). Meg Ryan and John Cusack made a good job with the main characters' voices. But the actor that deserves a standing ovation with his work in this movie is hank azaria (who gives voice to apu in simpsons, for example), he plays bartok, who is the reason for most of the laughs in this movie. The animation is not bad, but the movie is from 1997, so... Still, there are a few parts where the characters are not well draw, nothing terrible tough.If you want to have a nice time watching an animated classic, this is a must see. I like it, and I've shown it to my nephews and they loved it. They laughed a lot, and said that it was lots of fun. And that's what this movie offers you... fun, after all it's a great kid's movie.",Anastasia
108,whitly_12,A Very Under-Appreciated Classic,9,17 March 2011,"Allow me to just say that I've only ever seen 4 Don Bluth movies: The Secret of NIMH (which is an instant classic, mind you,) An American Tale (which is underrated,) The Land Before Time (although it's been years since I've seen that one) and Anastasia. Of these four movies, Anastasia is easily Bluth's most interesting and under-appreciated. But before I get to why that is, let's give a little run-down of what it's about:Anastasia, much like DreamWorks' The Prince of Egypt, is a modern retelling of an event in history. Just like The Prince of Egypt, it's a very liberal one. This means that it's not trying to be 100% accurate, but rather one meant to appeal to a larger audience while still showing respect to the source material. In this instance, Bluth is playing on the alleged rumour that Anastasia, the youngest of the Romanov daughters, may have actually survived the Russian Revolution that caused the Romanov family to be murdered. As Anastasia tries to escape with her grandmother, she's knocked out-cold, loses her memory, and is separated from her to not be seen again for a good decade.Fast-forward 10 years. Anastasia has been living all this time as Anya, an orphan brought up in a foster-home run by an irritating old woman. As Anya decides to make her way to the city and find a new job, she bumps into a con-man named Dimitri. Dimitri, along with a man named Vladimir, keep hiring women off the streets and training them in the ways of the Romanov family in an attempt to pass them off as Anastasia to her real grandmother and earn the reward for finding her. Anya, desperate to know who her real family was, goes along with it, but little do the three of them realize the irony of the situation and-ultimately-the dangers awaiting them from an old foe long-thought to be dead.Now that I've set that up, it's time for me to tackle the complaints:The first issue that people have with this movie is that it's a cheap knock-off of Disney. It's not. It's actually an expensive one, costing over 50 million dollars to make. That being said, that's not exactly a bad thing; after all, The Prince of Egypt was also a knock-off of Disney, and yet it was still a well-executed one that surpassed The House of Mouse in many ways. In the case of Anastasia, it doesn't quite surpass Disney in quality, but it still has enough substance that it can work on its own. Not to mention that, when you compare it to the other movies that Bluth has made in the 90's, it seems like he's actually trying this time.Another complaint that keeps being made is how this movie is historically-inaccurate. Once again, it's not trying to be. It's based off of a rumour that suggests that Anastasia may have actually survived the slaughtering that took the lives of her father, mother and siblings. Of course, it's never been proved that she actually DID survive, but that's why it's called a ""rumour"" and not a fact.The third, and perhaps biggest, complaint involves that of the villain. People have called him the biggest insult to the real Grigori Rasputin, whose personality doesn't match that of the Rasputin in the movie in the slightest. Once again, I'd suggest not taking that too personally. Ramses in the The Prince of Egypt wasn't anything like the real Ramses II either, yet he was still a very fleshed-out and interesting character. While the Rasputin in Anastasia is disappointing in other ways (especially in his downfall,) he's still given enough character that it doesn't matter if he's not true to history. Besides, I hear very little complaints about Hades in Disney's Hercules, even though the original story had Hera in that role.In terms of the movie itself, it's a lot of fun to watch. The animation is still stunning by today's standards, the soundtrack is excellent (even though one of two songs aren't so memorable) and the voice-acting is top-notch. I was especially pleased that Dom DeLuise wasn't in this movie, as-despite having been a Bluth regular for quite some time-he's quite irritating and has almost-always gotten the role of obnoxious comic-relief during his career (he's been replaced by Hank Azaria, but that's only a minor nitpick.) Aside from having Christopher Lloyd as Rasputin and the ever-so-excellent Jim Cummings as his singing voice, the real highlight-for me, at least-is Meg Ryan as Anastasia. I don't recall her being in any animated film before or since, but I'd gladly go watch it if she is. The story in Anastasia isn't perfect-there's the odd flaw here and there-but I have to give Don Bluth credit for actually trying this time. And you should check it out too, as it's a great movie that encompasses just about everything that made Bluth one of the greatest animators of the 20th Century to begin with.Final Score: 9/10.",Anastasia
109,a_kilpatrick,Surprisingly Disney-ish for a Non-Disney movie,10,4 July 2006,"I have heard all the comments that this movie is historically incorrect. That's a good point, but not one that should affect the viewers opinion of the movie. You can go on and on about how bad you think the storyline or animation is, but if you insist on disliking the movie because of it's factuality (or lack thereof), then you must not have grasped the spirit of the movie. The spirit is what counts. And before people go and think that I really do think the animation and storyline suck, I Don't. I have no problem with the animation, and I'm always a sucker for a good romance, which is what this movie offers. Somehow it seems more.... mature than a Disney movie. More 'grown-up' so to speak. I don't know why, but I think it deals with the relationship on a deeper level, or maybe I'm crazy and it's exactly like any Disney relationship... either way, it was still very good and I'd recommend it to anyone. Unless you don't like animation, catchy songs, cute little puppies and ridiculously handsome con-men that you can't help but fall in love with.",Anastasia
110,jkcsarah,A Terrifying Story Turned Into A Terrifying Children's Movie,6,2 February 2002,"This movie should have never been made into a cartoon for children to see. First of all, the real life story of Anastasia is terrifying and unsolved. The movie does not include the fact the the real Anastasia was never found and was not reunited with her grandmother, as was shown in this movie. But on a worse note, instead of changing the whole story to fit with the happy not real ending, they made many scenes too much like real life for a children's movie. When I saw this movie, I personally found it too scary to watch as a young child. This was the wrong story to make into a movie, and worst of all, it was done poorly.",Anastasia
111,incurableflame,Beautiful Film,8,14 February 2021,"I'm at a loss for words at the beauty and the heart of this film. While at times overly-dramatic in music numbers (I'm not a fan of musicals) and a little simplistic, it's nevertheless really heartwarming and the artwork is obviously breathtaking and merges beautifully with the soundtrack. I actually teared up a couple of times, and I loved Rasputin (voiced by Christopher Lloyd) and his albino bat sidekick Bartok, who was only ever genuinely concerned about his master's well-being and stress management and essentially wasn't even evil. The whole idea of Rasputin basically being a zombie who would occasionally drop a limb or two (or all of them) was both grotesque and hilarious and definitely an original concept I haven't seen elsewhere. Rasputin himself was like a mix of Hades (Disney's ""Hercules"") and Scar (from 90s ""The Lion King""), though exactly why he wanted to destroy the Romanov's wasn't made clear, apart from there being some kind of betrayal he took really hard , obviously. I'm not exactly satisfied with the fluffy ending, since I'd think Anastasia's greater priority should be to help Russians back home who were clearly shown to be miserable and poor under Communism and actually hoped that Anastasia was still alive. Then again, this is a fairytale so I guess marrying your sweetheart (who was actually prepared to step away from her life even if it hurt) is more important than your responsibility as a monarch.In any case, I feel like this could definitely be a perfect movie to watch during Christmas-time, as it evokes a really nostalgic and authentic fairytale feeling. I would also recommend it to anyone who enjoys the steampunk aesthetic, because this film has a lot of that kind of vibe. I loved it. 8/10.",Anastasia

I will say they kept the story fresh and alive throughout the entire film. But I loved the songs most of all in this movie especially ""A Rumor in St. Petersburg,"" for that particular scene looks and feels like a live Broadway show.

115,cipher123,Substandard Bluth film is not a threat to Disney.,2,1 September 2000,"Despite its beautiful animation, ""Anastasia"" falls flat on its face due to an extremely bad script.  To date, the only good movies Don Bluth has ever put out are ""The Secret Of Nimh"" and ""An American Tail"" (only the original, not the godawful sequel).  There is practically no character development and the final conflict between Rasputin and Anastasia makes absolutely no sense.I especially found the music to be horrendous, especially the tune that plays during the scene in Rasputin's lair with all the bugs and worms singing (I cringed in terror every second during this scene).  The only good song was probably the one Anastasia sings herself.If Don Bluth is going to continue churning out such inferior material, then Disney really has nothing to fear.  If you really want to watch an enjoyable non-Disney animated flick with good music and story, try ""The Prince Of Egypt"" from Dreamworks!",Anastasia

This can be watched by both young, and old audiences. I have looked up the royal family, etc., and they have all been cartoonized, and look very much like the real people.

I was actually impressed with the attention to details: Nicholas looks very much like he did in life, Anastasia's little brother's sickness is not overlooked (he is walking with a limp), 'Once upon a December's words 'Someone holds me safe and warm... ' sound so much like a Russian Gypsy song! That said, I do have to say that there are a few things that could have been prevented by hiring one Russian speaking person. Examples: When Dimitry and Anya first meet, he has a problem pronouncing her name. That would never happen. Anya is a very common name in Russia and would not be mistaken for anything else. Also, when Sophie opened the door she says something that IS NOT a Russian name, very silly. Another example would be Anastasia looking through her family album, when they make her memorize thing, remember the picture of uncle Vanya? (""Loved his vodka, got it Anya?"") Well, he just looks like a common peasant, not a member of royal family.Bartok. I wonder who thought of the name. It is not a Russian name My guess is that it was meant to be 'BRATOK' which means 'little brother', used to address a companion, a friend. So.. those are my thoughts. All in all, I highly recommend the movie. Not as an educational historical reference, but as a wonderful entertaining musical animated movie! The fact that is NOT Disney is actually a big plus for me!Enjoy!",Anastasia
120,pm4000,Watchable but not that good,6,31 May 2014,"This movie was OK I guess, the songs were good and not as annoying as they are in most movies. The main story is about a ""former"" princess who has to leave Russia to reunite with her grandma after the Russian revolution. For my personal taste the characters are too one dimensional. This made it hard to really connect with the characters. There is one thing that really bugs me about this movie. The villain is kind of a sorcerer what really doesn't fit into the early 20th century setting. The sorcerer has little to nothing to do with the whole plot. Literally all scenes he is in are childish, annoying and are not really essential to the movie. I think in the middle of the picture there are 45 minutes without him appearing. The story of the princess going to Paris overcoming obstacles and finally finding love would've worked better without his distractions. The story is standard from beginning to the end I've seen it done better but I've seen it done a lot worse too. I think if you are really into romantic animated movies with singing and all that stuff you are going to have a great day. If you are not into that (like me) you probably won't have that much fun but you might find yourself actually enjoying some scenes if you don't mind that the movie doesn't give a f... about history.(Even though I am German I watched the original English version)",Anastasia
121,ladykannie,Simply The Best,10,22 June 2006,"I have seen many, many animated movies featuring princesses and romance and music, most of them Disney. And after comparing ANASTASIA to all of these 'classics', I must say that I like ANASTASIA the most.First, lets address the whole historical aspect. NO, this movie is not historically correct. One would be in a world of hurt if they were to try to use this to teach a child a history lesson. I am a person who is usually bothered by major historical inaccuracies. Of course, I admit that I know very little about this time period and about these events. To someone who is very interested in these events and is very knowledgeable on them, this movie might bother them. But keep in mind that this IS a children's movie-not meant to be historically accurate. It is meant to be fun, and this it accomplishes.It is in the music that distinguishes this movie in my mind and puts it in a category of its own. The songs are simply amazing. There is not one song that I do not enjoy. Liz Callaway is just wonderful as the singing voice of Anastasia. When she sings ""Once Upon A December"", I get chills every time. It is such an eerie and beautiful, haunting song. And paired with the scene in which it is shown in, with the ghosts all dancing, well, it's hard not to be moved. And then there is Jim Cummings, singing as Rasputin. ""In The Dark Of The Night"" is also an amazing song. Very fun, yet still a bit scary. Of course, these are just two songs out of many wonderful songs. If anything, get the soundtrack, as it is just wonderful. The music blows all of the Disney songs out of the water, in my opinion.Now, the romance. Yes, of course there is romance, this is a cartoon princess movie, after all. But it is not the love at first site plot that is so familiar to Disney movies. The romance is slow and just full of tension. Never before have I been able to feel such sexual tension between two cartoon characters. But the bickering Anya and Dimitri is just wonderful. Such chemistry! It is nice to see two characters get to know each other before falling in love.Overall, this is just a wonderful movie. I remember loving it when I was younger and it had just come out, and I love it just as much today. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.",Anastasia
122,Dossbehr,See it! Buy it!,9,7 August 1998,"OK... I know what everyone says... this is NOT Disney... Well guess what I love Disney and I LOVE this movie. I hope that Fox can improve themselves so they can give Disney a run for their money...The more quality animation out there the better..Yes it is historically COMPLETELY INACCURATE, so what ! It is a fairy tail... It is a wonderful story... if you want to watch where they got the idea for this movie rent Anastasia (1956) with Ingrid Bergman and Yul Brynner. This movie is as good!  The animation is beautiful ! The scene when Ana is dancing in the ballroom is even more breath taking than the ballroom scene in Beauty and the Beast. The train wreak is as good as any live action I have seen. Now there are some flaws with this movie... Pooka is just too cute for words... I REALLY hated this little dog! And Bartok while quite funny was also not necessary... BUT I still LOVE this movie and recommend it highly!",Anastasia
123,BPAL,Best Disney Movie!,10,14 March 1999,"This is the best Disny movie ever! It has wonderful animation, voices, and 'magicalness'! But, the best part of all is the extremely juicy plot. It is one of the best stories in time!",Anastasia
124,WED-2,What were they thinking?,1,23 July 1999,"I have absolutely no problem when studios animate history.  I first became defensive when Disney produced ""Pocahontas"" but under further inspection, I found the tale to be quite endearing and heart-warming.  It may have not followed the historical path, but since when have animated tales EVER followed the original details?  Besides, the studios received the last laugh when hundreds of children flooded the public libraries when they were planted with a passion to learn far more about their American culture.But what atrocity has 20th Century Fox produced?  There is a fine line between what is just and what is down-right evil.  Ever look straight at the motives of Rasputin, the villain?  The man is simply out for blood.  No motive.  No explanation.  He wants a complete and undeniable obliteration of the Czar and his family.  He doesn't want power, riches, or other worldly possessions...just the humans' souls.  In one vividly depicted scene, Rasputin trades his soul to the devil (as his flesh is sucked away revealing his grotesque skeleton) for the ability to destroy the Czar.Furthermore, the film leaves much to be desired within the animation department.  How convincing is the characters movements (and voices)? ""Little Anya"", as Anastasia the orphan is called, leaves an orphanage kicking up snow and tripping over her own feet as she chases Pooka, certainly Fox's attempt at the cute factor dog.  Most distracting, however, is the studio's computer generated images.  They fill most every scene...and really don't fit.  Within the most intense or pivotal scenes, up pops some type of computer image which dashes all hopes of the scene's full impact. They are absolutely distracting and, since most of these objects practically fill the screen, one can tell that the objects don't belong.  I admit, computers have done wonders for the animated feature, but when the sight makes the audience think, ""say, that's made by computer, isn't it?"" their thought about the plot is lost and the scene discredited.  When a train wreck appears in one scene, it's shaky movement lessen the attention to the main characters, Anastasia and Dimitri.  ""Anastasia"" is definitely not the eye-candy of the 1997 cinemas.Of the songs, none are really memorable, except ""At the Beginning"" which is played during the final credits.  The animation that accompanies the film's songs are quite unnatural and, upon inspection, actually seems as if the characters are walking in circles while talking to themselves.  I'm quite the admirer of both Bernadette Peters and Angela Lansbury.  Their voices are unique and emotional, providing the animator with an enormously colorful palette to draw from.  I don't know how both ended up with such flagrant songs, not to mention the bland, unmoving personas/lines.  One scene which will forever remain in my mind is when Dowager Empress Marie (Lansbury) has her cab hijacked by Dimitri.  As her voice regally demands that the cab be stopped, her motions barely reflect the insistence within Lansbury's voice. What a waste of two exceptionally talented actresses.Had Fox devoted more attention to quality, this film would have reached the status of the incredibly brilliant ""Pocahontas"".",Anastasia
125,zigmund,It won't fail to move you,10,18 August 2000,"Firstly, I must admit that I only decided to see this movie because I'm a huge Meg Ryan fan, but after seeing Anastasia I can't remember a film that moved me more. Fox have out-Disneyed Disney with this masterpiece, a superb blend of romance, comedy and adventure set to some of the best visuals ever seen in an animated film.The stellar cast of voices is certainly worth the big bucks which it must have cost Fox to land them. Meg Ryan and John Cusack are both excellent, but Kelsey Grammer steals the show as Vladimir, with some fine singing and a decent Russian accent to boot.Where Anastasia beats most Disney films is in the music. The songs are simply exceptional and stay in your head long after the movie is over (that's not a bad thing, trust me). Liz Callaway's 'Journey To The Past' and 'Once Upon A December' are my personal favourites, but the entire soundtrack is worth buying, something you can't say for most movie soundtracks.A lot of these comments here criticise Anastasia for it's historical inaccuracy, which I find totally ridiculous. It's an ANIMATED CHILDREN'S FILM, not a history textbook. Don't try to analyse the accuracy of the portrayal of the Romanov family or anything like that. Just enjoy the film for it's magical story, enchanting music and dazzling visuals.10/10...an absolute must-see.",Anastasia
126,liz1248820,MY FAVORITE MOVIE!!!!!!!!,10,9 March 2000,"This may be the absolute best animated movie of all time! The mixture of normal animation and computer animation was great. The voices were perfect for the roles. The dialogue was punctual and meaningful. Even if it's not historically accurate, oh well. The songs were great, wonderful even. It remains my favourite movie to this day.",Anastasia

128,adamesq,Absolutely terrific from a non-historical perspective!,10,5 July 2005,"The story and character acting is at least as good as the best of Disney's princess movies. The animation is a little behind Disney's for 1997. No matter, Meg Ryan, Christopher Lloyd, Kelsey Grammar, Angela Lansburry and the screenplay much more than make up for it. The scene when Anastasia sings ""Once Upon a December"" is amazing. Lacey Chabert is in this too. She's the singing voice of Anastasia at the beginning of the movie. She also does the talking voice of Anastasia in the extras segment. The true history of Anastasia is horrible and unforgettable. It always is disturbing to see the true history of a fairytale...entertainment built on a tragedy. I would prefer that the story's characters have different names and take place somewhere else. Although then, we wouldn't have the desire to go back and learn the truth in many cases. As a fictional story, the movie is great.",Anastasia
129,stanislv,"That was a great combination of animation, music, history and comedy",10,12 January 1999,"I really loved that movie, even though the story is not so real. Actually, that was the best movie I have seen. It was a wonderful story about a dead dynasty, about a girl which has to find her family and about a wonderful love story. That combination of animation, music, history and humor was great. The only problem for me with that movie is that I can't find nontranslated videokassete with it.",Anastasia
130,stanislv,That movie was a great combination of animation and music,10,13 January 1999,"Actually, the story in that movie wasn't a really really real, but it was GREAT. I'm terribly sorry that the grade of that movie till now is only 7,6. Nevermind, different people have different opinions. What I liked best in ""Anastasia"" was the wonderful combination of the BEAUTIFUL music and the wonderful animation. It seems that people who made ""Princess Anastasia"" understand of russian royalism. The music was GREAT. I just fell in love with ""Far Away, Long Ago, Once Upon a December"". The melody, the lyrics, everything is GREAT in the music of ""Anastasia"" What I can do at last is to thank the makers for the beautiful animation, and to wonder from where to take untranslated cassette of that wonderful movie.",Anastasia
131,sarahjones1982,One of the best musicals of the 90s,10,27 July 2002,"Anastasia is a fantastic movie, you just have to realize that the film is not trying to be historically accurate. Once you move past this partial problem the film is incredibly enjoyable, beautiful animation by Don Bluth that has fantastic character design, realistic movement, and color. Combine that with a fun and entertaining story, cute characters and fantastic music on par with Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin and you have a can't miss movie not just for kids but the entire family. I can't recommend this film enough.",Anastasia
132,ruthgaved,Great film,9,9 October 2010,"I owned this film for several years as a child and loved it! Unfortunately it has since got lost or sold, but I have the best memories of it, and still remember some of the songs. Other reviews have said there's nothing in it to interest a child, but that was definitely not the case for me or my sister. The historical accuracy doesn't really matter, it's just a film and I didn't even know it was based on a true story until I was 12. Once Upon a December is a really beautiful song that still gets stuck in my head sometimes even though I haven't seen the film for 7 or 8 years. The only problem is it can be a bit scary. I can't remember details but Rasputin and the spirits did scare me quite a bit when I first watched it.",Anastasia
133,mudihini,Still as fantastic as I remember!,10,15 February 2019,"I remember watching this movie as a VHS over and over again. And finally one time I tried to research it and found out that the Dowager Empress Marie (Dagmar) grew up in Denmark, and this movie meant SO much in my life! Ever since I have been obsessed with documentaries about the real Romanovs and especially the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, and starting reading everything I could get my hands on about them.I adore this movie so much regardless of that a lot of it is made up, cause it was originally a kids movie! It had to be cheery! The real story would have been way too dark for kids :P and I remember thinking once that Rasputin was pretty scary actually, and fugly xD but this movie is a MASTERPIECE!!!",Anastasia
134,hannaliz,"Catchy, funny and adorable!",10,16 May 2015,"Whilst growing up, I watched this every single night, I knew all the words to the songs, I could of probably acted out the whole film. A few years ago I re-discovered it, whilst helping to sort out the old cupboard. I decided to watch it, as I remembered how much I used to love it. And afterwords I could totally see why. This film, (even though, it is an animated film, and I'm fully aware of that), is actually the most romantic and adorable film I have watched. Every time I watch it I just can't stop thinking about it afterwords. I did think it may be because of my love for it when I was little, but this film just causes you to feel so happy afterwords. I watched it with my younger cousin who is 4 years old, (sort of as an acceptable form of watching it) and as expected she loved it too. This film, honestly doesn't get enough credit at all. No one knows about it, yet, when anyone watches it, they automatically love it! What also makes this film so much better, it that it is loosely (only in a tiny way) based on a real story, and it you research what it is based on, actually links with the film well. The songs are catchy and imaginative, the script is witty and funny, and the outcome is so romantic and adorable. Amazing film, defiantly worth a watch!",Anastasia
135,inerrsh,Anastasia,8,6 January 2018,"A really nice wholesome movie. The music is beautiful, story-line is pretty predictable though. Nevertheless, really enjoyed it. This is the sort of movie that and group of people can enjoy together; whether it's a bunch of friends, a family or a couple. Be warned, the songs will be stuck in your head for a long time and you'll end up playing them on repeat for a long time after the movie.",Anastasia
136,movienightenvelope,The greatest musical there ever was,10,14 December 2015,"I've seen this movie, very literally, dozens of times. It is one of my favourite and most watched (and most listened to) musicals! Anastasia must journey from St. Petersburg to Paris to discover whether or not she is the missing princess but more importantly, she must sing songs along the way. Aided by con-men she takes a journey to the past to help her find her future. This movie has beautiful animation and a brilliant soundtrack! One time my brothers girlfriend borrowed this DVD without telling me and I spent weeks trying to find it. I made a post about it on Facebook, she saw it and felt bad that she had taken it. Luckily I own more than one copy of this DVD and I was still able to watch it.",Anastasia
137,dhthepoet-67136,My favorite movie,10,16 May 2016,"This movie is very special to me because it's a movie that my grandma and I used to watch together before she died. I feel like I am Anastasia sometimes because I lost my grand mother however I can't find mine as easily as she did. I love how Dimitri started to remember her and then fell for her all over again. The music is amazing and the music box will always be iconic. I actually have my own music box that is special to me because it keeps me close to my grandma. My favorite song will always be ""Once Upon a December"" and every time I hear it or sing it I start to think about her and all these memories start flooding back. This is my absolute favorite movie ever and I will never get sick of it. I always use the kids as an excuse to watch it.",Anastasia
138,performing_x_dream,"Truly Enjoyable, and Not to Mention, Absolutely Divine Music",8,30 August 2006,"I believe I was about 7 when I saw this movie in theaters for the first time. At let me tell you, I am now 16, and still after 11 years, the movie just doesn't get old. This is film is just absolutely lovely, and is great for all ages! Even though the facts and history shown through out the movie isn't always correct, that still shouldn't stop you from loving the characters, story, and above all, the music! The music is probably some of the best I've heard in a long time. Liz Callaway, who plays Anastasia's singing voice through out the film, is simply phenomenal. The other songs sung by Lacey Chabert, Jonathan Dokuchitz, and Jim Cummings are wonderful too! Two songs that really moved me (and which I still sing in the shower almost everyday) are ""Journey to the Past"" and ""Once Upon A December."" I promise you, you will be constantly singing those two songs everywhere you go after watching this film. That's probably why ""Journey to the Past"" was nominated for an Oscar in 1997!Besides the music, the characters are lively, unique, and can easily get attached too. Both my younger sister and I who both adore this film, admit that one day we hope to be just like Anastasia. :-) Of course there are other characters that are just as interesting and imperative to the plot line as well. Dimitri is polite and dreamy, while Bartok the bat is silly and hilarious! The acting voices being provided really help portray the characters as well! Christopher Lloyd does a great job playing the voice for evil character Rasputin. While Angela Lansbury does a lovely job playing the elegant and sincere Dowager Empress. The animation is not amazing, for yes there have been better, but it's still satisfying and nice to look at. Not to mention, the story is one you will want to know over and over again!So please watch this film when you have the chance! Especially you families with young children. This is definitely a film that all of you whether age 6 or 35 will enjoy. =)",Anastasia

140,Bethos42,"Fun, but silly",9,12 November 1999,"I have to admit I like this movie a lot. It's one of my favorite animated movies. This being said, here's what's wrong with it:1.) Completely historically wrong. My history teacher had fun assigning us to do a comparative: Choose a historical fiction movie and contrast it to the actual events in question. I used this one. I had fun.2.) There didn't need to be a villain, and yet there was one. Nothing against the actor, because in fact he rocks, but the character he plays just has no reason to exist /at all/. I own this on video and I fast forward through every scene with Rasputin in it whenever I watch it every time. It's just so dumb to have a villain with the incredibly cute storyline they had already.3.) The animation--been there, done that, got the T-shirt. The characters themselves, with their fantastic facial expressions, were wonderful. Dmitri and Anya and Vlaad and their facial antics are fabulous fun to watch. But...what the heck were they doing with the intermeshing of the weird bizarre computer 3-d along with all the pretty stuff they already had? It threw me. (Not to mention Anastasia's magic lengthening shortening hair...it's always a different length whenever she puts it down. Always long, but never exactly the same length. Struck me as a little, well, off.)
Other than that, well, the movie was great. It was just fun, you know.",Anastasia

I love every song, even the soundtrack was awesome! The characters were well picked, even if they did have American voices in 20th century Russia, they rocked! my favorite is the little bat Bartok, he was hilarious. I keep watching this movie, over and over again- its that good! I highly recommended it!",Anastasia
142,metaha30,Anastasia,6,4 May 2011,"Anastasia is a decent non-Disney animated film, inspired by almost every other Disney animated film. But it's not quite there. In fact, in its weaknesses, Anastasia bolsters everything that is good in Disney. (Forgive me if you're annoyed by the comparison to the aforementioned studio but the crew behind Anya obviously alluded the ""Magic Kingdom"" while making this film so it's inevitable for me to compare):Songs - when I'm watching most of Disney's films, the musical numbers are usually the highlight of the film. Here, it's quite simply, a bore. The songs drag too long, they lack any sense of wit, and they're bland. Every time I sensed a song was coming up, I yawned.Animation - things get better here. While the characters never move as believably or smoothly as their Disney counterparts, the backgrounds are often breathtaking. However, that aspect is not even either. The CGI effects were handled pretty badly and do not mesh well with the rest of the picture. A great example would be the train-wreck in the first half of the movie. The train, the backdrop and the billowing smoke don't look like the same image. The same goes for the crashing waves, magic dust, etc. I wish they didn't experiment with CGI so heavily because the result looks crude. I wouldn't be so picky about it but by 1997 the guys at D were pros at this. It should have been used to the minimum. Characters - Anya is fairly likable and Meg Ryan does a good job. But that's about it. The villain, who's supposed to be the most fun characters is dull and his demise is pathetic. The whole climax is bad actually. The sidekicks are silly, too. Thank god they're mute!I will applaud the filmmakers for undertaking a fairly complex story and managing to turn it into an animated film, even if there are historical inaccuracies along the way. You can't have it all. Something else that stuck out to me throughout the movie was many gratuitous moments that kept dragging the story. Most of the film was spent on preparing Anya and the rest (her reunion with her grandma and the battle) was squeezed into the last 15 minutes. I'm giving Anastasia 6/10 because despite its drawbacks, I still appreciate the amount of effort that was put into it. It's a decent film that I can surely understand why people would love, but to me it's just not good enough.",Anastasia
143,adrien823,My favorite cartoon movie,10,19 April 2004,"Ever since i was a small child i have lived in a world of fairy tales and imagination. After i watched Anastasia for the first time i remember thinking to myself, ""disney really out-did themseleves this time."" I was totally shocked to discover this was not a disney film. (Maybe this explains why i was a little confused. You see, although many people have commented that this film does not match up to those of disney's, i think it is much better.) Many have also said that this film gets on their nerves because it is not historically accurate. But let me tell you a little secret: i had no clue about anything that had to do with the real Anastasia before this film. After watching it, i then began to get interested in the real story. I believe this film does a great job introducing children to the story in a more mild way. Then later on, when their ready to know the truth they can do the research on their own. At least this film will get them interested in the story itself.The music in this film is genius. If you want to check to see if the music fits the film, see if it helps to carry the story along in a unique way. In a book for instance, an author can use exposition to explain the details. In a movie, what could normally be boring chatter turns into an intricate song which helps to tell the story. Anastasia does this with excellence. Throw in a stellar cast of voices and a beautiful scenic backdrop, and you've got an A+ film.I do have to agree with others about the villian of the film. This could have been handled in a more classy way. But this is the only flaw i find with the entire movie. Go and rent this one people! You wont regret it.",Anastasia

Disney still prevailed with the idea of women being weak, while Fox changed and chose the right and the best view for women. She is a pure heroine!

153,saint-eagle-buckeye,Has Potential,5,17 June 2007,"The fact that this movie is not historically accurate does not bother me - it is an entertaining animated movie, not a documentary.My biggest complaint about this movie is Rasputin. He detracts far more from the story than he adds; if you remove all of his scenes, you are left with a mature, beautifully animated movie. Rasputin and Bartok really do nothing for the story but interrupt it with annoyingly long scenes that look more like a Saturday morning gargoyles cartoon than the rest of the movie. Without these distractions, maybe the more important parts of the movie (Anastasia's and Dmitri's relationship, Anastasia's meeting with her grandmother, etc.) could have been developed more strongly. Rasputin, Bartok, their environment, and the supernatural occurrences attached to them simply do not belong in this movie, which otherwise looks and sounds very sophisticated. Nevertheless, there must be an antagonist - this role could have been filled by another group of con men with a fake Anastasia or by a realistic assassin - or *something* other than Rasputin.Aside from Rasputin, there is little to complain about - the movie is beautifully and realistically animated and has a great soundtrack, especially the haunting song ""Once Upon a December"". There are some truly memorable scenes between Anastasia and Dmitri, and every character (besides Rasputin and Bartok, of course) is believable and fully brought to life both as individuals and in their interactions. Definitely worth watching if you can put up with aforementioned shortcomings.",Anastasia
154,ayush-kishore,reincarnation,8,12 November 2007,"There seemed to be a reincarnation undertone to the movie. In my opinion it is incredible that Anya can forget her life before the orphanage. But when she returns to the old palace, she begins remember fragments of her past. This is akin to someone experiencing deja vu because of a past life. Also when in the old palace and speaking with Dimitri she says ""Were you a vulture in a past life?""--an overt reference to reincarnation. A lot of the movie seems to deal with the issue of remembering who one is. I gave the movie an 8 out of 10 because, although I enjoyed the storyline, I thought the characters were too shallow, i.e. their personalities weren't explored deep enough. I wish there was more dialog between the grandmother and Anya to know more about their relationship. But like I said before, overall its a good movie",Anastasia
155,dolphingirl2420,An Awesome Movie!,10,1 October 2008,"I watched Anastasia when i was 4 years old, and I remember falling in love with it. Now I'm 14 years old, and ten years later, I still love it! I recently re-discovered it again while it was mentioned in English class and I had to watch it. So when a friend suggested we watched an ""old movie"" i instantly said ANASTASIA! and she agreed. So we watched and EVERYTHING in the movie came back to me! The movie was fantastic! I admit, it is not historically accurate, but it is fine for this movie because it makes it more, ""magical"". This move is an all-time classic; with mystery, romance, and comedy. It is an absolutely Wonderful movie. I highly recommend that you watch it! The songs are amazing. The characters are pretty much awesome, although Rasputin may be a bit frightening. But what I really like about this movie, is the relationship between Dimitri and Anya, it's too cute. It's not like those movies where the characters are pushed into love from the beginning. But in Anastasia, love freaking BLOOMS, like it should. :) WATCH IT, ITS AMAZING! 10/10",Anastasia
156,mm3159,Overrated and Poor Quality doesn't make a Disney contender,1,16 December 2008,"This movie was a complete disaster from beginning to end. Sure, they got big name actors to be the voices, but they seem uninspired and lazy with how they interpret their characters. Beyond that the animation, even for its time, was outdated. The plot didn't follow the real story of the famous Russian royal girl. So if the plot doesn't flow with the real story, the actors don't...well talk well, plus the animations were outdated for that time...it equals to one bad movie.And as for anyone that thinks this is comparable to Disney movies is joking themselves, and needs to actually watch Disney movies along with Anastasia. The differences are key. Disney = quality family entertainment Anastasia = horrible waste of time",Anastasia
157,warriorcats-rachel,Amazing movie,9,7 June 2009,"The first reason I loved this movie was because the voices for the characters were actually singing. They didn't have two people for the same part, as in; Dimitri Singing Voice, or something. Linked to that reason are the songs themselves. They are over-the-top without being cheesy, a feat rarely achieved in most animated movies. The second reason I like this movie is because it has a great romantic plot line. There's none of the corny ""true love's first kiss"" crap that you see in a lot of Disney fairy tales. (Note to evil witches: if you're trying to poison a princess and there's even a possible cure... find another poison.) The one thing I didn't like was the villain, Rasputin. He was over-the-top, but not in a good way. I know it's an animated movie, but it was sort of based on a real story, and and undead corpse that can basically pull itself apart at will isn't exactly 'realistic.'",Anastasia
158,peterson1987,Probably my favorite animated film!,10,16 January 2013,"I love this movie! The score is amazing! I have to laugh at all of the people giving bad reviews over historical accuracy. Let me explain something that may help you get beyond this. This is what is called a piece of historical fiction. In other words, they took the fact that there was once a grand duchess of Russia named Anastasia, and basically made up everything else around it. Nowhere does this movie indicate that it is supposed to be about Ana Anderson, the woman who claimed to be Anastasia (and was not). Yes, we all know Rasputin was not a rotting corpse, nor was he even still living at the time of the imperial family's abdication and murder. For goodness' sake, it's an animated fairy tale, not a historical documentary! Get over it. We all know Anastasia was murdered along with her family. And as for nit picking about linguistic accuracy, having a degree in foreign language, myself, I find it absolutely hilarious that someone mentioned several inaccuracies in pronunciation but never once mentioned that the name ""Anastasia"" is actually pronounced ""ah-nah-STAH-see-ah."" But once again, get over it for goodness' sake! This movie is fantastic if you can sit back and enjoy it for the fairy tale that it is and not get caught up in trying to criticize the fact that it is not real.",Anastasia
159,paxiswolf,"Recently seeing Anastasia for the first time, and now it's easily in several of my top lists.",10,28 February 2011,"I had only recently seen Anastasia through Netflix when I was on vacation, and it's easily won my heart ever since. I had first mistakened the movie to be from Disney, because everything was fantastic in story and quality. The animation, characters, effects, music, and feeling of the movie was perfect. Usually animation can be a bit skippy, but this film's animation was very smooth and fit in with the realistic image of a live film. The personalities of the character's expressions and voices were spot on and enjoyable. I loved how Anastasia and Dimitri constantly acted towards each other from beginning to end, and how their feelings changed for each other throughout the film. I'm also usually not one for romances, especially in animation, but I fell in love with this one. I'm a fan of Anastasia x Dimitri, they're an excellent couple. The sarcasm throughout the movie was a winner for me, too.Now, usually I don't like the soundtrack animated movies give out. I tend to like skipping over scenes where a character decides to break out into a musical out of nowhere. However, Anastasia came across differently for me. I love both the music sung directly and/or indirectly from the characters, which is not often. Lately I have been going through an obsession with Anastasia and the music was a key point for me. I loved to listen to all of the songs multiple times.Each character created an outstanding part in the film. I feel each other, even the cameos, had a very good story and plot to be in there. Even Puka, who played the creative part as a sign for Anastasia to go back to her old town. The characters were fun to watch and carried out a great emotion, which can be hard to do sometimes.Overall, Anastasia is an outstanding film that warms the hearts of many. It's typically an unnapreciated film, but it deserves all of the respect and praise it can get. I can personally say, even though Anastasia is not a Disney princess, I still count her as my favorite princess if I'm ever asked. Anastasia is also one of my favorite romances, animations, and overall films of all-time.",Anastasia
160,nike8004,An Absolutely Wonderful Movie That I Believe The Whole Family Will Enjoy,10,9 April 2011,"This is my 2nd favorite animated movie of all time, right after Disney's ""the Hunchback of Notre Dame"". Heres a quick summary of why (without any spoilers!)1). The characters are livelyMost animated movie characters don't convey much of a personality. This movie is a wonderful exception. Anastasia has a slightly cynical and adventurous attitude voiced with wonderful spunk by Meg Ryan, and her lines don't have to explain her emotions for her. All of the characters converse in a realistic and amusing way, and this movie has the best dialogue by far than any other animated flicks.2). It understands its audience (& its audience understands it!)My young cousins (age 3 & 6) understood everything that went on in the movie, and they could not stop discussing it in vivid detail. I don't exactly know how the creators managed it, but they made it understandable to their target audience without having the characters or a narrator explain every little detail.3). The ""Animated Kid Film Requirements""-Cute but not sappy romance {CHECK}-A vile and awful villain that makes the children shudder {CHECK}-Animal sidekicks {Two checks}-Great visuals and outstanding animation {CHECK 10x}-Action scenes {CHECK}-A lovable hero/heroine {CHECK FOR BOTH}There are many other things that I adore about this movie, but sadly I have a word limit and I'm not sure if I'm going over or not. My only regret about this movie is that I just saw it for the first time on Wednesday, and it came out in 1997.",Anastasia
161,laura_pavetti,It's a great movie!!!!,10,11 April 2004,"I think that ANASTASIA is a great movie 'cause it is pretty well done and it's a movie that you can see as many times as you want and won't stop enjoying it and that's why it is a movie easy to understand... I like it also 'cause it is focus on the little daughter of the last Czar of Russia called Anastasia and how she ""supposedly"" gets her own to go to Paris and find her family with the help of her two friends and her puppy... It is a pretty interesting story 'cause at the start of the movie you can see that she doesn't have a very good relationship with one of this friends and, at the end, you can see them both pretty much in love to eachother...",Anastasia
162,animerice,favorite movie ever,10,11 August 2012,you know that movie from your childhood you can recite word for word?this is my movie like that. the live action version is very similar from the 50's. i love history and this movie has made that stronger. i even have the music box. i would love a replica of her necklace. this movie has so many of my favorite actors in it and my driving force to visit the palace one day. i love this movie so much it always gives me a dreamy feel. the songs are amazing. i just wish it had been more popular. gorgeous animation in it. a mix of cg and story board with such detail. even the prince for the princess is amazing. a con artist willing to give up money for his love. i used to dream of a guy like him now didn't happen.,Anastasia
163,liv_graham,This movie is amazing,10,18 November 2012,"I've watched this movie forever, and it's always been one of my favorites.Over the past year, I became interested in the true story of the Romanov family, and if you're looking for a historically accurate movie, I don't recommend it, but if you want a heartwarming, cuddle-up-in-a-pile-of-blankets movie, this is 100% it.My favorite part is when Anastasia and her grandmother are talking in her room. I always cry, and this is the only movie that will make me cry every time I watch it.This is a magical movie, that I will cherish forever.",Anastasia
164,gleekbellanever,What a Masterpiece,10,11 December 2012,"I can't remember exactly the first time I saw the movie. I mean, I've had it on VHS since I could remember. I guess I've just been watching it since then. The movie is quite a masterpiece. The script, the plot, the music. Gosh, I love the music. I swear that I never get tired of watching it. In my opinion, it's my most favorite cartoon musical yet.I also enjoyed the romance. It was perfect. Love at first sight, and a good, happy ending that nobody expects.Even the actors and actresses who voiced the characters were perfect and unique, it's what really made the movie beside the plot and music. I love how classic the graphics are.",Anastasia
165,Froot_Loops,Too much singing...,1,18 August 2004,"This movie is just boring and long. It has nothing to keep any kid interested in it. The progression of the movie is slow. There are too many songs and they are all way to long and drawn out. The only thing it has going for it is the animation style and artistic design. The voice acting is sub-par with the exceptions of Hank Azaria, Christopher Lloyd, Kelsey Grammer and John Cusack. Meg Ryan's voice acting is rather poor and is hard to tell that she is trying to show some emotion.A rather poor movie with some famous names in it. Go rent The Emperor's New Groove instead.",Anastasia
166,rboller-3,commenting on the music and charm of the movie,10,20 October 2004,"I thought this movie (maybe a bit graphic for young children) was still charming. It was able to make me laugh and feel with the characters during the more heartfelt scenes. I thought the animation was beautiful, and the storyline was well-developed.There weren't gaps in the plot, leaving the audience to suspend their disbelief and make up excuses as to what or why something occurred.The music was not only memorable, but it had a range of style, including haunting melodies and catchy beats. And the singers weren't concerned with sounding like pop singers, taking the audience out of the movie, which I appreciated.",Anastasia
167,so_long_insecurity,This Movie is Classic!!!,9,12 March 2005,"This movie is pure joy! It's adventurous, romantic and warms your heart every time. For all of those who love Disney princess movies you have to see this movie--it tops Disney's hands down. It's more real, the characters are more real (their expressions, their ideas, etc.) the whole story line is amazing!! The music OMG it's wonderful! well written, sung beautifully...the music alone should make anyone absolutely adore this movie! I advise anyone and everyone to give this movie a try!! You'll thank me later :) The first time I watched Anastasia it became one of my absolute favorites! You won't be disappointed. It's great, it's exciting, it's different, the music will make you wanna go out and buy the sound track!--it's that good.don't just take my word for it! go out and watch it yourself! you'll find, you'll agree with me.",Anastasia
168,becasaurus,I can't stop watching it!!!,10,17 July 2013,"Warning: Spoilers!!!I remember watching this movie as a child on a VHS, but because they are now outdated, I hadn't watched it for years. But it was not long ago I found it on Blu-Ray and bought it unsure whether or not I would find it as good a story as a did almost a decade ago. And I was not disappointed! I say ignore those people who only hate this movie because of its historical inaccuracy, I mean, is it really that important for a movie to be historically correct to be great movie? I hardly think so. I think this story line is in every way amazing! And because this was based on a true story, it encouraged me to research and read up on the real story of Anastasia. This movie is a masterpiece and clearly one of my favorites. The characters are all great in their respected roles and the one thing I particularly loved was that Anastasia, even though she found her family and remembered her past, she gave back the crown so she could be with the one she loved. How many other 'princesses' have done that?? It's a refreshing end! The songs are hauntingly beautiful - so beautiful I went out and bought the album. It's visually great to watch and even though some parts may be a bit scary for the younger audience, I would certainly recommend this as a must-watch! Such an excellent movie! I'd be watching this for many years to come!",Anastasia

170,cicci-4,"Wonderful movie, amazing music :D",9,27 November 2005,"Anastatsia is without doubt one of the best animated movies ever made, for several reasons. It's an amazing story, filled with adventure, romance, smart dialog and wonderful music. The story is set in Russia and other parts of Europe, both in the wonderful palaces of the Czar family and the french countryside. It tells the story of the lost princess Anastasia, and uses the rumors that she as the only one of the Romanov family survived the massacre during the Russian revolution. Anya, a girl with no memory of her past, meets with two men of questionable professions that promise to take her to Paris, if she's willing to try to convince the Dowager Emperess that she might be Anastasia... Unfortunately, the evil sorcerer Rasputin (the man who killed the Romanov family) also knows that Anya is alive, and swears to kill her, whatever the cost... So Anya is taken on a magical adventurous ride through Europe, to find her family. One of the best things about the movie is the characters. They seem so real, like real persons, not platonic, ""a beautiful damsel in distress"", ""a handsome hero"" end of story... The music is wonderful, better than in many Disney movies, and the story very good.The only things I don't like about the film, is the things that's dangerous about making movies about real historical events. The Romanov Family weren't the innocents victims they're painted out to be, and the fact that the story is based on that... But I've only started to think about this now when I'm older, so... Anyone who likes a good movie, rent or buy Anastasia. It's worth it. I should recommend the Swedish version, if someone here was to see it. Helen Sjöholm is the singer of Anya's role, and she is one of the best singers in Sweden...",Anastasia
171,chloep97,A very good film,9,13 August 2015,"I remember watching a spin off to this called 'The Secret of Anastasia' and it was similar to this in the aspect that it included the story of the Romonovs. I was born in 1997 so I couldn't watch it when it first came out. I was searching for the spin off earlier this year so I could watch it and I found this film and I can say it was one of the greatest discoveries I've made. I love musical films and this one didn't disappoint. I love how they portrayed the love story of Anya and Dimitri and I love the music that goes with the film. I've always loved the story of the Romonovs and especially the disappearance of Alexei and his sister's bodies. History, especially German and Russian history, has always been a love of mine and this film contributed to it. However, if you don't like history, it doesn't matter as the story is still amazing in itself and you don't need to know about the history of it anyway. I would recommend this film to anyone.",Anastasia
172,annedominguez17,Re-making the movie (with actors),10,30 December 2007,"I just watched the movie a few minutes ago. It's one of my favorite animated romance movies. How they met each other, go through adventures together, and Dimitri realizes Anya IS Anastasia and he doesn't accept the money plus risks himself to rescue her is so beautiful and they fall for each other. My favorite song from the film in the end credits the song "" At the Beginning"" from Donna Lewis and Richard Marxx. Thinking about it now, I think it'd be a great idea if they re-made the movie, but with actors instead of animation. I'd totally love to see that. Who else agrees??",Anastasia

So for all of you who continually compare this to other Disney films you are doing so in error, because the standards here are different. You can compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges, but not apples to oranges.With that in mind, this was actually a wonderful production. The costume ideas on this are historically believable. The choices for voice acting is great, I'm a big fan of Meg Ryan so I enjoyed that. I hope to see Fox do more pictures like this in the future as I think it would be beneficial for them to reach beyond non-animated films.",Anastasia

Don't get me wrong, the bat was so chill and made the movie awesome. Also, where did the girl bat at the end come from? Why is she such a slut? No one I know in real life would just go up to a stranger and start making out with him. What the heck is that? Those are just a few questions I had about the bats.

If you didn't like it just because of that, then go shove your review up your bum. Anastasia was one of the better movies I had seen the year it came out. And if one more person says it was to ""graphic for young children"" I am going to slap them. It's not graphic at all, it's funny, refreshing, and most of all, it was A CHILDREN'S MOVIE! Who CARES what the adults think... it was made for kids so leave it ALONE! And no one better be bashing All Dogs go to Heaven OR Land Before Time!",Anastasia
