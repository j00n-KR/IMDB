0,claudio_carvalho,Beautiful Romance,8,10 December 2006,"In Japan of the 20's, the nine years old Chyio (Suzuka Ohgo) and her sister Satsu (Samantha Futerman) are sold by her fisherman father to a Geisha house in Miyako. Satsu is not accepted in the house and is sent to a brothel, and along the years, Satsu escapes from he brothel where she lived and the rebel Chyio is left alone, becoming a slave of a geisha. However, six years later, she learns how to become the geisha Sayuri (Ziyi Zhang) with the support of the successful Mameha (Michelle Yeoh), while fighting against the evil and jealousy of the wicked Hatsumomo (Gong Li). While still a child, Chyio falls in love with The Chairman (Ken Watanabe), and in the post-WWII, they meet each other, in a period o changes in Japan with the occupying American forces and the country completely destroyed.The first half of ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is a beautiful drama, telling the story of the country girl Chyio alone and adapting to a new life style in a house of geisha. Then, in the end of World War II, the screenplay becomes a soap-opera and the story becomes lesser and lesser attractive. However, the cinematography, the art direction and the costume design are amazing along the whole movie. But the cast speaking in English and keeping some Japanese words seems quite ridiculous for me. For such a careful production, this seems to be an unforgivable mistake. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Memórias de uma Gueixa"" (""Memoirs of a Geisha"")",Memoirs of a Geisha
1,lee_eisenberg,perfect,10,8 May 2006,"It seems that when ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" came out, it split the critics and the public. Some said that it had a perfect plot, others said that it had perfect visuals, others said that it outright sucked. Well, I want to tell you that they do a good job in every way. Telling the story of how Nitta Sayuri (Zhang Ziyi) got kidnapped and turned into a geisha for the rich people, the movie shows us things that we never imagined that we would see. Personally, I hadn't really known much about geisha culture before seeing this movie, but now I feel like I know everything.The movie also brings up some interesting points. By getting turned into a geisha, is Sayuri getting sold into slavery, or is it a path to a better life? Always something to wonder about. And they don't forget to put everything in historical context. It starts in the 1920s, and the people of Japan seem really optimistic about everything...until after WWII.All in all, this is a very well done movie. Zhang Ziyi has truly shown herself to be a great actress during the past few years, and this affirms that. Ken Watanabe also has a good role as The Chairman, for whom Sayuri starts working. I know that some people may object to casting a Chinese person as a Japanese person, but it's not like they cast a white person in the role. A great movie.",Memoirs of a Geisha
2,Tweekums,Entertaining and beautiful to look at,8,19 April 2015,"In pre-war Japan two young sisters are sold to separate geisha houses; the older of the two manages to escape leaving young Chiyo behind. Here she works as a servant dreaming of the day that she can become a geisha; although that dream seems to be ruined before it can get started when Mameha, the most successful geisha in the house, takes against her. One day while out the local Chairman shows her an act of kindness; offering words of comfort and buying her flavoured ice. After this she resolves that she will become a geisha despite her lack of training. Time passes and another geisha takes her under her wing and sets about training her. She learns quickly and the soon becomes a rival to Hatsumomo who is determined not to be usurped. Meanwhile she meets the Chairman again, assuming he has long forgotten her, but it looks as if any relationship will be impossible.I was initially a little put off by the films run time but I needn't have worried it didn't feel long as I was quickly drawn into the story of young Chiyo and her life in the geisha house. Suzuka Ohgo does a fine job playing Chiyo as a child with the excellent Ziyi Zhang taking over when she goes up. The story progresses at a good pace with plenty of emotional ups and downs as Chiyo's prospects change each time it looks as if things are going in the right direction something happens to dash her hopes usually due to Hatsumomo; a delightfully self-centred character played by Gong Li. The romance is nicely understated in a way that meant we could believe neither party knew the others feelings.Much has been made of the use of well-known Chinese, rather than Japanese, actresses to play most of the leading characters; this didn't bother me it seemed little different from having actors from one European country playing characters from another and nobody seems to worry about that. They did a good job and at no point did I have any difficulty understanding what any of the cast were saying so they either spoke English fairly well or did a great job speaking it phonetically.The film looks great; it's not surprising that it won an Oscar for the costume designs. The great look doesn't stop there though; the sets give a feeling of the era and some of the scenery is stunning; especially in the scenes set in the formal gardens. The film also provides an interesting insight into the very traditional world of the geisha. Overall I enjoyed this film more than I expected and definitely recommend checking it out.",Memoirs of a Geisha

One time grown up(Zhang Ziyi)she is saved by his rival Mameha(Michelle Yeoh).She'll work in laborious activities until achieve being the Japan's most celebrated Geisha confronting against the jealousy contender(Gong Li). From the starting point are described the emotions,records and infancy images; continuing with the adult epoch and her success as Geisha until the second world war and after time in that protagonist tries going the ancient way of life,thus problems are always cropping up among conflict of tradition and modernism. The picture is plenty of inventive and stimulating images and develops a complex human drama,love story and is pretty moving. The film is a nice rendition of a famed bestseller by Arthur Golden and lavishly produced by Spielberg and Douglas Wick. It's colorfully and stunningly photographed by Dion Beebe.Brilliant and luxurious costume design was realized by Collem Atwoodand,besides wonderful Japanese houses and gardens with lush production design. Evocative and atmospheric music with oriental sounds by the master John Williams who in that year(2004) made four excellent musical scores:War of the words,Star Wars,Munich and this movie. The motion picture is rightly directed by Rob Marshall. Well worth watching for the cinematography and gowns. Rating :Above average",Memoirs of a Geisha
4,edwagreen,No Memorable Memoirs Here **1/2,6,7 April 2006,"The tale begins in pre-war Japan with two children sent out by their parents. One is accepted into a place where Geishas are. The other is never heard from again.The film has been described as the best backstabbing film since ""All About Eve."" How ridiculous that statement is. The latter film had memorable dialogue, the dialogue here is ordinary.Our young heroine is mistreated by a well-known Geisha and the old lady who heads the place.Our story gets going as the girl grows up to become an apprentice-like geisha. She does well and challenges the geisha who had mistreated her years ago.After a major blowup with the latter geisha, World War 11 intervenes and our heroine hides out but is a victim of war deprivation as well.As a young girl, she meets a man who shows her great kindness. This man may very well be her love interest as the film ends. Our heroine is not Gigi and the man is not Louis Jourdan.The end of the war means that Japan, in defeat, will change as they learn to practice capitalism. Our heroine will be needed to get on the good side of the American occupants so as to spur American investment in Japanese industry. As the closing credits appear, I was more than happy to say sayonara to this film.",Memoirs of a Geisha
5,jotix100,Rivalries,7,10 December 2005,"Arthur Golden's novel ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" deserved a better fate. This immensely satisfying book got a tepid adaptation by Robin Swicord and Doug Wright, and it begs for a better screen play than what was chosen to be shown on the screen. Director Bob Marshall's next venture after his successful and popular ""Chicago"" seemed, at least on paper, like the right candidate to be in command of the film version of the book, but what he has created seems to have become an oriental soap opera, at best.The story is narrated in the first person by Sayuri who has been sold by their impoverished father. The novel is a chronicle of how Sayuri learns to become a geisha and her rivalry with the queen of them all, Hatsumomo. Also it is about the relationship between Suyuri and the Chairman. Hatsumomo's competition is the beautiful Mameha, who takes Suyuri under her wing and shows her the ropes. The Chairman and Nobu are the men in and out of this story who change Suyuri's life for the best.The casting of Ziyi Zhang as Suyuri doesn't pay off. Ms. Zhang is a beautiful creature to look at, but in this film, her acting appears to be empty, in sharp contrast with her appearance in ""2046"". Gong Li, another beautiful woman, appears in all her fury to challenge her position as the queen that she has always been when Sayuri comes on her own. She is a caricature of the character that she is trying to portray, no doubt guided by the director, in a performance that seems campy in its flavor. Michelle Yeoh, Ken Watanabe and Koji Yakusho do what they can in a film where the center of attraction are Ms. Zhang and Ms. Li.The basic flaw of the film is the dialogue that feels so foreign it might have been written in another language. The different accents of the cast doesn't help matters because they speak in a sort of British English that is a distraction. The wonderful costumes are by Colleen Atwood who dresses the women in silks and makes them look fantastic. The cinematography of Dion Beebe is an asset too. The haunting musical score is by John Williams, a man who knows how to enhance a film with the right sounds.""Memoirs of a Geisha"" under the direction of Rob Marshall is a spectacle directed to fans of the book, who will surely flock to see the film, but alas, they will not find the essence of Mr. Golden's novel in the finished product.",Memoirs of a Geisha
6,dbborroughs,Okay story of a geisha is better in pieces than as a whole.,6,17 December 2005,"This is the story of a young girl who is sold into a life of servitude by her parents. Over time, through pluck and through luck, she rises up to become a geisha, all the while keeping her eye on The Chairman, a powerful man who once showed her kindness.The easiest way to describe my reaction to this movie was I liked it, but I didn't love it. Its a far from a perfect film that takes a while to get going, but is a pleasant enough diversion once it does.The film is beautiful to look at. Its the sort of thing that will end up in electronic stores wishing to sell high end TVs since imagery is so spectacular people will think every thing they watch will look this good. The imagery is so good in fact it looks unreal, no reality can look that good. Still its pretty to look at.The acting is a cross board excellent. I don't think anyone turns in a bad performance, which helps getting over the rough spots (though more about the performances in a moment).Unfortunately the film contains numerous problems. The first is that the script isn't all it should be. I have not read the source material, however I get the feeling that things were left out or sped up. I know it happens all the time but there were times when I felt that something was missing, often regarding character back story and development. I know that the fact this movie covers several decades means that details have to get left out, but the choices here don't always see to have been made for the better.The second problem is that this film should not have been made by an American film maker. For whatever reason this film felt like a Hollywood film and not a real story. Rob Marshall is a good director but I wonder how much better this might have been if this had been done by a Japanese or Asian director who was closer to the material. There were numerous times when I wondered how someone not from Hollywood would have chosen to shoot a scene. I wonder if the score the film would have been so stereotypically Japanese. Marshall's choices aren't bad they just don't always seem the best. For example, as good as the performances are, I never lost the feeling that these are actors in a movie. A large part of the problem is the heavy and varying accents that everyone speaks with. Many in the cast do not speak English as a first language and their polyglot ways of speaking made it sound silly to me (like the very movies from the 30's and 40's). During a good portion of the film I wished it was all in Japanese or Chinese, or even Swahili, anything other than English so I wouldn't notice the accents.Still despite my misgivings about much of the film, I did like it. Actually I liked it enough to wish it were better. As its stands now its a good film with moments of greatness. Perhaps had I seen this on DVD or cable I would have been more forgiving. Is it worth seeing? Yes, its one of the most beautiful films of the year. Its also a look into a world few in the West are familiar with. I leave the choice of how you see the film to you.6.5 out of 10, subject to revision upon a second viewing.",Memoirs of a Geisha
7,lastliberal,"Please, Sayuri, do not be afraid to look at me.",9,25 July 2007,"Mameha: Remember, Chiyo, geisha are not courtesans. And we are not wives. We sell our skills, not our bodies. We create another secret world, a place only of beauty. The very word ""geisha"" means artist and to be a geisha is to be judged as a moving work of art.I will immediately dismiss any criticism that involves closeness to the book or the use of Chinese actresses in a Japanese film. This is a work of art that deserves to be judged on its own merits.Obviously, the lush sets (John Myhre (art director) and Gretchen Rau (set decorator); costumes (Colleen Atwood); cinematography (Dion Beebe); and the incredibly beautiful music (John Williams), made this a visual treat that is to be experienced over and over as one would enjoy any fine art.Beyond that, we have three very gifted and talented actresses that brought forth sterling performances that are worthy of remembering. Ziyi Zhang (House of Flying daggers, 2046), Li Gong (Curse of the Golden Flower, 2046) and Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Jet Li's Fearless) are favorites that I watch over and over in every film they do. They never disappoint. They were superb here and deserve to be recognized for their accomplishment. Neither did Ken Watanabe (The Last Samauri).Absolutely breathtaking!",Memoirs of a Geisha
8,grantss,Dull and seemingly interminable,4,23 June 2014,"Dull and seemingly interminable. Starts slowly, continues going slowly, thinks of speeding up, but then goes slowly, and eventually ends. All this, and the movie didn't really make a point. It is simply one long drifting story.Plus, the whole movie just seems culturally stereotypical and insensitive. Americans, even senior officers in their army, are brash, boorish louts. Japanese women are submissive to the extreme. And don't get me started on Chinese actors/actresses being cast as Japanese...Performances are OK. The standout is probably Susuka Ohgo as the young Chiyo. American characters are not played well at all.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Great acting and some beautiful cinematography. Sayuri's dance scene was mesmerizing.",Memoirs of a Geisha
10,view_and_review,Probably My Favorite Fiction Novel,7,16 March 2021,"""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is probably my favorite fiction novel--and this is from someone with decades of reading under his belt--so watching the movie was a must. Of course, the book was better than the movie, but that doesn't mean that the movie wasn't good.The Geisha whose memoirs we are made privy to was Chiyo aka Sayuri. She and her sister Satsu (Samantha Futerman) were sold as kids by their father who hoped for a better life for them. He was old and poor while his wife, their mother, was dying. The two sisters were split up with the older sister, Satsu, being sold to a brothel and the younger, prettier Chiyo (Suzuka Ohgo), was sold to an Okiya (geisha house). For those who know as little about geishas as I did, then the difference between the two is vast while at the same time minimal. They are both paid to entertain. You already know what's expected of the prostitute. The geisha is more sophisticated, talented, and beautiful and is not supposed to have sex with a client. She is expected to entertain in a much broader manner.Chiyo was miserable. She was the object of abuse by a geisha named Hatsumomo (Li Gong), and she was relegated to servitude and stricken from becoming a geisha herself. She may have remained nothing more than a maid had not a successful geisha named Mameha (Michelle Yeoh) noticed her and took her as an apprentice.""Memoirs of a Geisha"" does a fair job capturing the culture and the life of a geisha. I think I was able to enjoy the movie more than most because I read the book and knew what was going on. It wasn't a must to have read the book to enjoy the movie though it would help. And there were certain parts I think it was necessary to have read the book to fully understand what was happening. The movie could never be as deep, rich, and poetic as the book, but I think it was well done.",Memoirs of a Geisha
11,evanston_dad,At Least Their Hearts Were in the Right Place,5,4 October 2006,"I've not read the bestselling book on which this film is based, but I suspect that Rob Marshall jettisoned everything that made the book compelling and left us with a pretty but hollow husk.Regardless, this is one lifeless movie. It's pretty as a picture, to be sure. In fact, stunning production design seems to be the only thing that interests Marshall about this story, for all of the energy he puts into his movie. Now we know what ""Chicago"" would have been like without the musical numbers. However, prettiness alone isn't enough to save this film, and anyway, it's pretty in that digitally enhanced way that never looks like real life, and that ""important"" films use when they want to give their films an Oscar-ish sheen. It worked -- the Academy dutifully handed ""Memoirs"" Oscars for art direction, cinematography and costume design.Too bad the acting and screenplay aren't of the same caliber. The film plays out like an Asian version of ""America's Next Top Model""; it's all bitchy cat fights over who can be the better geisha. In the meantime, children become orphans and prostitutes, WWII comes and goes, lives are forever altered through true love, and not one scene carries any dramatic or emotional impact or even seems to matter much at all as long as there are pretty sets to look at.The hotness factor is high -- Ziyi Zhang, Michelle Yeoh and Gong Li all in the same movie! But only Gong Li manages to bring any energy to the film as a hateful spitfire. Poor Zhang isn't able to make anything of her character, whether through her own fault or the fault of the script I'm not sure. Certainly the script doesn't help any, with its leaden voice over passages that sound like they're being read verbatim from the book but aren't at all right for a movie. The voice over just flat out tells us things about Zhang's character that should be conveyed through her performance, but aren't. Yeoh is a welcome if somewhat bland presence, and the movie comes alive for a brief period when she instructs Zhang in the ways of the geisha. But the life slowly goes out of the film like the air out of a gradually deflating balloon, and the last half hour or so is deadly.A well intentioned misfire.Grade: C",Memoirs of a Geisha
12,ferguson-6,"On your feet, not Off them",7,29 December 2005,"Greetings again from the darkness. The first film since the award-winning ""Chicago"" for director Rob Marshall takes us to Japan ... or is it China? ... or is it California? Well that all depends if you are discussing the story of Geisha, the lead actors or where most of the film was shot. This culture has always fascinated me so I give little thought to the disputed practice of casting Chinese actors for Japanese roles. Having seen all types cast in movies regarding American history, I have little difficulty remembering it's only a movie.Gong Li, Zhang Zyi and Michelle Yeoh are not only three of the most beautiful actresses in the world, they are also amazingly talented and their on screen chemistry is fun to watch. Gong Li is the real stand out playing the ""bad girl"" role and she seems to relish the opportunity with her cutting comments and wicked facial expressions. Zyi and Yeoh (both from ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") add class and heart and are perfectly cast as rising star and legendary mentor. Ken Watanabe (""The Last Samurai"" and ""Batman Begins"") says little but emotes much with his limited time on the screen. His quiet and reserved mannerisms say so much.What prevents this from being truly great is that Marshall does not possess the visual sense of Ang Lee and most of the picture is filmed too dark for its own good ... even the outdoor scenes which should have been breathtaking are missing the full color punch. The story never really decides if it is about the delicious rivalry between Gong Li and Zhang Zyi or if it is the forbidden, long-hidden love between Zyi and Watanabe.On the plus side, John Williams' score is beautiful and the magic of Yo-Yo Ma and Itzak Perlman are on display - make sure to stay for the stunning sound over the closing credits. Overall, an enjoyable and interesting movie that could have been great with a bit more light and punch.",Memoirs of a Geisha
13,gradyharp,A Visually and Musically Stunning Film,8,21 February 2006,"Why there is so much polarity with the audiences of Rob Marshall's cinematic adaptation of Arthur Golden's exquisite novel MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA is puzzling. Even in the theater there were those who left halfway through - reason unknown. Despite disagreements on the casting techniques and on the emphasis changes between the book and the film, MEMOIRS remains one of the most visually arresting, genteel films of the year. That it comes across as somewhat of an epic soap opera is no one's fault but the writers. And what is so wrong with an old-fashioned soap opera of a story afterall? The opening scene of the turbulent sea and heavy rain that accompany the silent selling of two poor sisters to a merchant planning to place the girls in houses in Osaka gives an indication of the importance of water in this story. The sisters are delivered to a house of geishas and only one is selected by the hard madam. Through years of suffering and anguish the chosen one becomes a geisha, finds comfort from her childhood of poverty, gains loving mentoring by a top geisha, becomes the most sought after geisha in Osaka, finds her love, endures WW II and eventually returns to her dreams. The interplay between the girl and the various members of the geisha training and bartering complex add flavor and conflict that keep the story flowing.The three principal actresses - Ziyi Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, and Gong Li carry the film well. The large cast includes favorite actors Ken Watanabe and Mako. The settings are splendid, the special effects such as the cherry blossoms, the autumnal reunion of Zhang and Watanabe, Zhang's spellbinding dance - all are brilliant. John Williams' musical score blends the best of Japanese folk music with contemporary writing and is greatly abetted by the talent of Yo-Yo Ma and Itzak Perlman.Part of the brilliance of Golden's novel was the meticulous explanation of the myriad details of geisha training and demeanor and makeup and tradition, and while the film version touches on these, the bulk of them are passed over. For this viewer there is a problem with understanding the dialogue due to the enunciation by the actors and the covering of much of the dialogue with ambient music. But that is a minor complaint. In all, MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA is an enormously beautiful and affecting film, one that multiple viewings will no doubt enhance the viewers' appreciation. Recommended.

14,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Memoirs of a Geisha,10,14 January 2006,"It's been a long wait for the movie to come to our shores, and I'd tell you it's all well worth it. Having touted many directors' involvement with this project (like Steven Spielberg, who's now producer), Rob Marshall finally got chosen to helm Arthur Golden's bestseller. And having an all recognizable Asian cast to shoulder this Hollywood production, is an achievement in itself in my opinion.To the detractors who were up in arms over the casting of non-Japanese actresses as the leads, what's up with you? Sure they're not natives from the land of the rising sun, but bear in mind this is a Hollywood production, and it's all about the business too. Having actresses that the West are not familiar with, is like taking too huge a gamble. So we have Zhang Ziyi as the protagonist, whom a number would be familiar after her turn out in the caper Rush Hour 2, as with Michelle Yeoh with her stint as a Bond girl in Tomorrow Never Dies. Gong Li would be familiar to those in the art house circuit with Wong Kar Wai's 2046 making its rounds. We do have Japanese in the movie, though mainly the male leads like Ken Watanabe (after a dismal appearance in summer blockbuster Batman Begins) and Cary-Hiroyuki ""Mortal Kombat"" Tagawa.And it's indeed commendable effort from the actresses fronting the movie, having to learn and be convincing in the age old culture of the Geishas. There's another camp who're lobbying that the film is not accurate. Hello, this is a movie, based on a fictional novel. You want accuracy, go watch a documentary or something. Perhaps the only thing I found peculiar was the addition of the English subtitles, as if the Asians cannot speak properly and audiences need help to decipher their accented English? Zhang Ziyi plays Chiyo/Sayuri, the daughter of a fisherman who got sold away as a young girl to a Geisha house. It's the usual rags-to-fame storyline, where rookie gets bullied, endures hardship, and one day, with a bit of luck, gets the opportunity to become one of the most famous in their profession of choice. And indeed the strength lay in Ziyi Zhang's competence in pulling off this coup, acting opposite 2 other accomplished actresses.Gong Li plays Hatsumomo, a famous Geisha in her time, by with a wild, arrogant streak in her. She feels threatened by the arrival of the young girl Chiyo, and goes all out to frame and make life difficult for her. From the start, you know that these two characters have hatred running through their veins. It's interesting to see Ziyi and Li pair up - 2046 doesn't count as they didn't share scenes together. Both were once director's Zhang Yimou's muses, with Ziyi touted as the new Gong Li when she emerged from the scene. They do share some similar facial features, and it's somewhat strangely satisfying watching their cat-fights on screen, as if it's a wicked tale of Celebrity Deathmatch.Michelle Yeoh plays Mameha, another famous Geisha in her time, and here, she takes on a more mature role, developing a mentor-protégé relationship with Chiyo/Sayuri. Mameha teaches and refines Chiyo, and orchestrates her, if I may use the word, career of Sayuri. From the onset, Mameha has big plans for Sayuri, and we see the politicking side of the world of the Geisha, of becoming famous, of crafting a reputation, and the deft plotting that one must adept to in order to survive in the dog-eat-dog business world. Michelle and Ziyi paired off in Lee Ang's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon as adversaries, and probably had memorable scenes together when fighting off each other in the rooftop and teahouse battles. Here, they go to the other side of the spectrum in becoming ""sisters"" as they coordinate to outwit, outplay and outlast Hatsumomo.The most interesting would probably be the second act where we witness the meteoric rise of Sayuri. We are introduced proper into the complex Geisha life of rules and protocols, accompanied by the brilliant score of John Williams' and with Yo-Yo Ma on the cellos. The beautiful costumes and rich sets also become testament that the filmmakers spare no effort in bringing Kyoto, and the world of the Geisha, to life.Perhaps the third act of the film, set after World War II, was the weakest of the three, as it seemed rushed to achieve closure for the romance between Sayuri and the Chairman (Ken Watanabe). It's a love that cannot be expressed freely, although one which had started from an infatuation, from respect, and became an obsessive fuel to become the best. With face and reputation at stake, it's truthfully sad that this is no period Pretty Woman. Perhaps the only uplifting moment in the third act, is the unexpected twist of betrayal, that you'll never see that patient stab in the back until it is too late.It's a beautifully complex movie, and I'm amazed by how much can be weaved into what is seemingly a straightforward plot. This movie might give non-readers an excuse to pick up the book to learn more and dwell deeper into the psyche of the characters. But first, be enthralled by the movie, a must-watch this January.",Memoirs of a Geisha
15,siderite,"Very well conveyed emotions, lack of authenticity",7,31 December 2005,"Well, the most surprising thing about this film I cannot reveal, because it would spoil the entire experience. I wonder myself what would have happened if I knew this little secret before I saw the movie. But be assured, there is surprise and mystery in this movie.What is nicest about the movie is the way it transports you in the atmosphere of the ages and how it makes you a partner in emotion with the lead role.What is not so nice is the fact that they used mostly Chinese actors to recreate a Japanese theme. I mean, you realize that there must be something fake when you understand most Japanese conversations in the film. And you are not Asian.OK, for the girls. They played beautifully. I just love Michelle Yeoh, but Li Gong plays a hard role and does it very well. Ziyi Zhang has the lead role and i am glad she is not playing a neurotic Chinese woman again. Playing Japanese suits her well.The men are not so well known for their lead roles in famous movies, but you can easily recognize Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa or Ken Watanabe, even if they play secondary less challenging roles. Mako is there, playing a very small role in a film which is nearly his number eighty. At least they are Japanese :)Conclusion: it did feel a bit too long for me. At one time or the other I was certain that it will be terribly boring. However, it delivered a good ending, even if an improbable one, and the atmosphere and acting were very good. Choose a time when you are more relaxed and have time on your hands and watch it. It is worthy.",Memoirs of a Geisha
16,JamesHitchcock,An Attempt to Visualise a Foreign Culture on its Own Terms,7,20 February 2006,"""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is set in the Japan of the 1930s and 1940s, and tells the story of Chiyo, the young daughter of an impoverished fisherman, who is sold by her parents to a geisha house. At first Chiyo is treated little better than a slave, particularly by the famous geisha Hatsumomo who has taken a jealous dislike to the young girl, but matters improve when she becomes the protégé of Hatsumomo's great rival Mameha. Mameha teaches Chiyo all the skills of her profession, and the girl, under the assumed name of Sayuri, becomes one of the most admired geishas in Kyoto. Westerners sometimes see Japanese culture in terms of picturesque stereotypes; if the archetypal Western image of the Japanese male is the samurai, the geisha is the female equivalent. Both these archetypes have had recent big-budget Hollywood films dedicated to them, ""Memoirs"" following closely behind Edward Zwick's ""The Last Samurai"". In my view, however, ""Memoirs"" succeeds better than the earlier film, which had two big drawbacks in its presentation of Japanese culture. Firstly, it tried to glorify one of the less attractive aspects of that culture, the aggressive militarism of Japan's warrior class, and secondly that culture was seen through the eyes of an outsider, Tom Cruise's American army officer. ""Memoirs"", although it was based upon a novel by an American author, presents us with a view of Japan as seen by the Japanese characters; the American soldiers occupying the country in the second half of the film are never more than secondary characters. Unlike ""The Last Samurai"", which took a ""traditionalists good, modernisers bad"" view of Japanese history, ""Memoirs"" tries to depict both the positive and negative aspects of tradition. The geisha system is a peculiarly Japanese institution, with no precise equivalent in the West or, indeed, in other Eastern countries. Although geishas were not prostitutes in the way that we would understand the term, they were dependent for their success on the patronage of powerful men, and obtaining that patronage normally involved the provision of sexual services. In the film, the right to take Sayuri's virginity is auctioned off to the highest bidder. A successful geisha could aspire to a standard of living much higher than the poverty that was the lot of most Japanese women during this period, but this did not alter the fact that Japan was a highly male-dominated society and that even geishas were dependent upon men. Much of the criticism of the film has centred upon the fact that all three leading female roles are played by ethnic Chinese actresses, something that has given rise to adverse comment in both China and (for different reasons) in Japan. I have no wish to use this review to set out my reactions to that comment, but I must say that this casting did not spoil the film either for myself (I am an Englishman) or for my wife (who is, like Michelle Yeoh, a Malaysian Chinese). Yeoh, Gong Li and Zhang Ziyi are currently three of the most accomplished, as well as most beautiful, actresses currently working in the Far East, and if the principle were ever to become established that characters could only be portrayed by actors of the same nationality, the cast list of many Hollywood films would start to look very different. Of the three, I thought that Zhang was the best in this film, making Sayuri an appealingly sexy heroine. A geisha was said to have the ability to stop a man in his tracks with a single glance, and Zhang was well able to convey this sense of seductive glamour. Yeoh was good as Mameha, but I was disappointed in Gong Li as Hatsumomo, as she seemed wooden and unable to make us believe in her character's villainy. Li has always been excellent whenever I have seen her in her previous films, but those were all Chinese-language movies such as ""Raise the Red Lantern"" or ""Farewell My Concubine"". Like many actors, she doubtless finds it easier to act in her own language than in a foreign one. There were to other excellent performances in this film, from Suzuka Ohgo as the innocent young Chiyo and from Ken Watanabe (who was also very good in ""The Last Samurai"") as the Chairman, the wealthy businessman with whom Sayuri falls in love after he shows her kindness as a child, although I would agree with the reviewer who pointed out that he did not seem to age enough between this scene and the later ones where Sayuri is an adult. Visually, this is a lush and strikingly attractive film, conveying a sense of the Far East even though most of it was actually filmed in California. One thing I did not like was the rather contrived happy ending, something of a cop-out as a more downbeat one would have been more in line with the film's generally tragic atmosphere and the idea that a geisha can inspire love in men but is fated never to find true love herself. Nevertheless, I found this a generally enjoyable film, a genuine attempt to visualise a foreign culture on its own terms and not just as a picturesque backdrop for some big-name Hollywood star. 7/10",Memoirs of a Geisha
17,OllieSuave-007,One of the most beautiful films I've seen!,9,3 March 2014,"This is one of the most beautiful movies I have seen - a rags-to-riches story about Nitta Sayuri (Ziyi Zhang), where her childhood life in her fishing-village was depicted and how she was sold to a geisha house in Kyoto's Gion District, eventually becoming one of Japan's most celebrated geisha.Set before and after World War II, Dion Beebe's cinematography captures the brilliance of Japan with its pagoda-style homes and buildings, people-filled courtyards with bridges and streams, and dozens of cherry blossom trees. The people are seen in their culture-rich clothing including the flowing kimono.This movie features, I think, some of most gorgeous actresses from Asia, including Ziyi Zhang and Li Gong. The rivalry between the two were staged breathtakingly; Zhang's Sayuri becomes the new geisha in town whose innocence and beauty surpasses that of Hatsumomo (Li Gong). This sets off Hatsumomo's jealously, and her rage and hatred towards Sayuri was astonishingly depicted. Her coldness combined with her overwhelming beauty made Hatsumomo a stunning villainess.Michelle Yeoh gave a great performance as Mameha, who is a motherly figure to Sayuri and takes her under her wing to make her become a great geisha. All the geisha dances were wonderfully staged; I just wished that Sayuri was given more scenes to show her dance styles and geisha performances.To top if off, the unfolding drama throughout the plot, terrific direction by Rob Marshall and John William's spellbinding music score made this movie an intriguing masterpiece.Grade A-",Memoirs of a Geisha
18,sddavis63,An Interesting Look At Geisha Life,7,13 September 2008,"The movie would, of course, be more convincing if it really were based on the memoirs of a geisha! As it is, this is a movie version of a novel by Arthur Golden (unread by me, I admit) which leads immediately to the question of how accurate the depiction of geisha life is. My initial reaction to this film (I, with absolutely no knowledge of geisha life) was that it provided an interesting look at the subject, with that one niggling qualification in the back of my mind.Set in 1930's and 1940's Japan, the story follows the life of Chiyo (later, Saiyuzi) who is sold to a geisha house with her sister by their impoverished father, who has to take care of his sick wife. The sisters end up separated, and Chiyo has to find a way to survive. As a young girl, she's shown kindness by a stranger (known as the Chairman, played by Ken Watanabe, who sees her and buys her flavoured ice) and then lives her life in the hope of being reunited with him. Her story is in one sense a very sad story, given the breakup of her family (and we're told in the opening narration that it's a story that should never have to be told) but it's also a story of triumph in a sense, as Chiyo/Saiyuri survives. Within the geisha world there is friendship, rivalry and deceit as all battle to be the best at this mysterious calling, and then challenge as those involved try to rebuild the life after the American occupation.There are good performances from especially Suzuka Ohgo as the young Chiyo, Ziyi Zhang as the mature Saiyuri and Gong Li as her chief rival Hatsumomo. I've become familiar with Ziyi Zhang and Gong Li in some Chinese language movies, and enjoyed watching them in an English language production. The end result was both a bit too romanticized, and also still quite sad in a sense, as Saiyuri reunites with the Chairman, but notes that as a geisha, the best she can hope for is to be a ""half-wife,"" although the narration suggests that, for a geisha, this is happiness.All in all, this is an enjoyable movie, perhaps a bit long at times but never slow paced. 7/10",Memoirs of a Geisha
19,Buddy-51,too pretty for its own good,6,30 June 2006,"If you like your historical fiction visually opulent, dramatically inert and just a wee bit on the stuffy side, then ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is the movie for you.Based on the best-selling novel by Arthur Golden, ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" tells of a small girl who is sold into virtual slavery, trained to pleasure men as a mincing, tea-pouring geisha. The movie shows us the inner workings of this strange and exotic world - the rules, the rituals, the internecine conflicts and the ultimate dehumanization of the women therein. Yet, it does so in such a clichéd, prettified way that the sharpness of the message winds up getting blunted, smoothed over, and ultimately contradicted in the process.Dion Beebe's Oscar-winning cinematography (though actually not as impressive as the work in either ""Brokeback Mountain"" or ""The New World,"" which were also nominated), along with the ravishing costumes and sets, does indeed create a lovely tableau of 1940's Japan, but often at the expense of the theme, which is to show us the UGLINESS not the beauty of that world.The tale is largely slow-paced and languid, with the first section, in particular, playing a bit like an Oriental version of a Charles Dickens melodrama. The acting is decent for the most part, but eventually everything - the storyline, the message and the performances - wind up getting buried under the trappings.",Memoirs of a Geisha
20,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Uneven, uninvolving life story depiction",4,11 February 2006,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits While Oriental cinema in itself contributes a great amount of revenue to the film industry, occasionally Hollywood takes note of this and a film like Memoirs of a Geisha gets made, an ambitious, well intentioned but deadly dull affair that hasn't translated well from the novel.The story begins with two young sisters being separated after their parents sell them to be used by those who wish to use them, and the first half of the movie follows the one sister's desperate quest to be re-united with her sibling. But then the film moves on to the girl, now a lady, breaking free from the grip of her controlling boss, and falling under the wing of a nicer, more understanding lady who guides her in a more positive direction. But as she struggles to become the best geisha she can be, personal crises and those from her past bearing a grudge threaten to stand in the way, whilst she yearns to get re-acquainted with a man she loves who brought her some ice cream one day.I think you may find my plot summary a bit wavey and you'll notice I can't remember the names of the characters or the actors who played them and that should be some indication of how little interest I was able to display in Memoirs of a Geisha. No matter how hard it tries, it just doesn't work as a film, with a story that has no real flow in terms of a beginning, middle and end with some naff editing that will have you fidgeting in your seat some time before the end arrives. The story, if you think about it, is also pretty vulgar and misguided, if you think of a much younger girl falling for a man who took pity on her as a child.Some of the cinematography, soundtrack and acting are undeniably good but as a film it certainly hasn't found it's place on the big screen. **",Memoirs of a Geisha

But there's precious little insight on offer in this rather plodding, yet coy, account of a geisha's life, which shies away from the dirtiest business and wraps its details up instead in a rather trying love story and a straightforward good-versus-evil tale. While the scriptwriting is simply laughable, containing lines such as ""he has a weakness for beautiful women"" delivered with a straight face.

It also has a remarkable soundtrack,with cello solos from Yo Yo Ma and violin parts sung by Yitzhak Perlman. Yet, while the eyes and ears may immensely enjoy the 150 minutes of screening, the heart and the brain may have some problems.Or maybe not the heart. If you look at this film as to a love story, it is a beautiful and moving one. It's the story of a young girl who comes to accept her destiny of being forced into geisha life just to get closer to the world of her lover. A love story that spreads over many years and has as background the transformation of the Japanese society during and after World War II. This is where the more disputable theme of the film lies - by reflecting over the traditional Japanese society it almost seems nostalgic to the Japanese society before and during the World War, contrasting with the behavior of the American occupiers after the war. All this is too simplistic, even more than in other films with similar themes like 'The Last Shogun'. Another opportunity to understand better the Japanese culture and its relation with the outer world is lost in clichés, and maybe we should resign ourselves that we should not seek for it in Hollywood movies.Much was said about the casting of non-Japanese actors in some of the principal roles. I would say that if you accept the Hollywood convention they act rather well, especially the two actresses that played the principal heroine as a child and as a mature woman. Overall it's a good film and a beautiful love story at Hollywood scale, but not a true story about Japan and its traditions.",Memoirs of a Geisha
23,MLDinTN,still not quite sure what a geisha is,6,21 October 2006,"I didn't think this movie did a good job at describing a geisha. I still don't get was a geisha supposed to be an escort or a sometimes prostitute or an entertainer. The story revolves around a girl sold who becomes one of the top geishas in Japan. She's coached how to walk, dance, use a fan, be a companion for men. I guess the men paid her and her ""mother""(the lady who owned the geisha house) although that is never shown. She has a rival who spreads lies about her and tries to steel clients, but the ""mother"" still picks her to inherit all. The rival gets jealous, causes a fire, and is kicked out. This whole time Sayuri has loved the Chairman but they have been kept apart by circumstances. But things work out at the end.One thing I had a hard time getting over was they all spoke English. I mean, if you wanted to make a realistic film, it should have been subtitled. And I didn't think the story was all that entertaining. There was probably a lot more in the book that was left out.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but I was expecting more from such a long drama.",Memoirs of a Geisha
24,secondtake,"Goreous and inauthentic, melodramatic but almost glib in its emotional manipulations",7,26 December 2012,"Memoirs of a Geisha (2005)This is almost an epic in the way ""Gone with the Wind"" is. Both are about a woman trapped by circumstances who find way to mature and survive. In both the world absolutely swirls around them, leading the plot into wartime, and into the aftermath. Both are filmed with constant, vivid, fluid beauty in period perfect color. Both are gripping and complex stories that reveal and time and a place with sympathy.Not to push it too far. In every way, ""Memoirs"" is no ""Gone with the Wind."" But it's a terrific story set in 1930s and 40s Japan. A young girl, Chiyu, is sold into that peculiar female servitude unique (I think) to Japan, the world of the geisha. And we feel the horror and loneliness of this girl's journey. She adapts, she sees mean and backstabbing role models but she also finds good women who help her and protect her. Up to a point. In the end, especially when men come into the equation, she is on her own.One of those men appears in her life early on, when she is a small girl, and she forms an obsessive crush on him. This is the driving inner force of her life throughout the movie. The drama of the movie is quite compact for such a sprawling scene, centering on a world that is weirdly sheltered and even cloistered. In fact, the journey of Chiyu is almost like a nun's without the god part, completely changing mannerisms, clothes, and even name. Chiyu becomes what is a decorative performer above all--a true geisha. A geisha is not a prostitute, but gets confused for one because she performs in the company of men, or even serves as a companion for one in public, but she isn't supposed to have sex with them.The leading actress, playing the older Chiyu, is actually Chinese, though most of the rest of the cast is Japanese (or Japanese American). And Chiyu is given blue eyes, and distinguishing trait that helps make her different, but which also makes her a little too Anglo for believability. (The case is easily made that traditional Japan would shun a woman as a geisha who doesn't fit a purely Japanese type.) There is also no question about her background, why she had blue eyes.Which brings us to an odd quality of the movie--everyone speaks English. This used to be a common norm in old Hollywood for American movies set in foreign language lands. But suddenly everything is inauthentic. You get used to it, but it's in the background. What's even more obvious is how everyone is made to speak in an accent, like they've learned English but just barely. So the dialog is always stilted--an Asian cast performing for an American director.And American producer--Steven Spielberg. This might seem good to people who know his movies, but Spielberg has a tendency (when he's directing) to add a slight Disney filter to events, that sanitizing and idealizing that makes for a sparkling movie. And a safe one. A storytelling fable. He was originally scheduled to direct ""Memoirs"" and when he was taken off it seems he left his stamp behind.This is a contrived bit of filmmaking, almost entirely shot on sets in the old Hollywood manner (geisha districts don't exist anymore). Even the dialog was sometimes pieced together from little phonetic pieces taken from outtakes in order to create a certain kind of sound (and correct pronunciation for certain actresses). The director, Rob Marshall, was probably in over his head on this one--he directed the glitzy ""Chicago"" before this--so some larger decisions about how to weight the plot and give the movie heft as well as poignance are awkward. But the crew around him is first rate (a Spielberg perk) and so the camera-work is gorgeous to the point of stealing the show and it's editing with gorgeous elegance. The music (John Williams) is predictable and sadly inauthentic, but fits the general falseness of the movie.So really we have a compromised movie that might not have been easily made any other way. The production company is partly Japanese and so there was an opportunity to push for more cultural honesty, historically and in the casting. But in the end it might not matter. It's not a documentary. It's about a poor girl swept away against her will into the soap opera known as life. That the movie could have been more than this may or may not matter if you get sucked in and just enjoy it face value.",Memoirs of a Geisha

This sumptuous, gorgeous dramatic love story is one of the most potent ethnic love stories for Americans in many, many years. The entire movie is focused on forbidden love and the bearing the burden of such love in typical Japanese style. The performances are strong, the bitter emotional conflicts, the traditions, the elegance of the Geisha are well portrayed. In the best ethnic, soap operatic style of Japanese drama possible, this movie exposes the layers of stereotypical deprecation of a demanding and richly traditioned human art form - a girl as a living work of art and the suffering and sacrifice that attends to such a life. Unlike Dr. Zhivago, the epic Russian Revolutionary love story, Geisha spends all of its time on the people, and Suyuri in particular with the politics of men, of war only as historical canvas or backdrop. Instead the audience is witness to the intimate living experience and burden born by the mysterious Geisha and brings honor and human distinction to this noble but perhaps sexist and maybe dehumanizing traditional role in Japanese society.

27,filipemanuelneto,Excellent.,9,6 August 2017,"This movie is a dive into the world of Japanese Geishas. Its a misunderstood profession, full of mysteries even today. However, the film makes everything wonderfully enjoyable, emotional, so intense and engaging that I almost didn't feel the two and a half hours the movie takes. The story begins when young Chyio is sold by her parents to a geisha house. At once, it shows the drama of the separation, and we almost feel the child's excruciating pain in the incessant search for her sister, who quickly becomes the last family she feels she has. Then it will end, as Chyio takes his only remaining path of life: the life in the geisha house, ​​learning their profession by initiative of a mature geisha, who takes her as an apprentice. Other strong themes of the plot are the envy, rivalry between geishas and the difficulty they have to keep a romantic life since they're expected to be single and not behave like prostitutes. In any case, the plot captivates our attention and Chyio, later Sayuri, becomes a character the audience is able to empathize with.Despite having a good Eastern cast, mostly female, the highlight goes to Ken Watanabe, Ziyi Zhang, Suzuka Ohgo and Li Gong. Watanabe is virtually the only sounding name for western audiences, as he has a solid career in Hollywood, but the three female actresses I mentioned have brightened more than he did, as their characters have more presence and prominence than his Administrator. Li Gong is truly hateful as a villain, while the two actresses are the children's/adult version of Chyio/Sayuri. Cinematography, costumes, make-up and art direction are also brilliant and deserves to be congratulated. The film is visually magnificent, and the audience truly understands the effort made to make it realistic and believable. Mistakes or problems? In my opinion, perhaps just the difficult of reconciling English dialogue with specific Japanese terms. If they're terms without strict translation to English this is perfectly understandable. Anyway, since I watched the film with subtitles for European Portuguese, this linguistic issue didn't represent a problem for me, although I admit that English-speaking audiences may feel some difficulty with Japanese terms they don't know.",Memoirs of a Geisha

I remember thinking that this was an okay piece of film-making the first I saw this, but then I saw it a second and a third time and I was honestly completely blown away. Nowadays this is one of my favourite movies. And I still haven't quite pinpointed just what it was that I missed the first time and realized during the following viewings. The obvious signs of a good movie were there from the beginning. The superb actors, the rich scenery and the attention to detail, the intriguing story that never quite goes the way you expect, the atmosphere that convinces you that you really are there or at least that you should be there - they were all there. And yes, I've seen some people complaining that this doesn't give an accurate image of the 20th century Japan and the geisha culture. Well, to you I say that I'm pretty sure that The Sound of Music quite gleefully dismisses some facts about the 20th century Austria during the war and I'm pretty sure that the Inglourious Basterds is nowhere near the truth when it comes to the war in France. The fact is that all of these films are entertainment. They will tweak the facts, they will ignore some details and make up their own if it makes the story flow better. And I, for one, am totally cool with that. Embellish all you want if it produces a film of this quality.For me this is one of those movies that suck you in. That allow you to live a few hours of your life in a foreign strange place that is perhaps a bit dark and threatening, yet it feels like you've lived there your whole live. There's just enough familiarity in the way that these people struggle through their lives, their common and not-so-common squabbles, their morals, that it feels familiar, yet there's enough exotic, strange and awe-inspiring that it becomes interesting. And perhaps I just wasn't in the mood to be sucked in the first time I saw this one. Because that's what this movie requires. It needs you to sit back, enjoy the scenery and invest a moment of your life to these wonderful, cruel, heart-warming and enduring people that populate the streets of the geisha district.

We have here a story about Japanese women written and directed by Western men, with the lead actresses being Chinese! Did anybody involved in the project ever use that atrophied organ, the brain, to think what they were doing? Of course Gong Li and Zhang Ziyi ('with eyes like rain') and Michelle Yeoh are marvellous. We love them! But they are Chinese, as is Eugenia Yuan, and even the strangely-named Zoe Weizenbaum of America, who is presumably either half-Chinese or an adopted Chinese. One of the male actors was Chinese, and another was Korean. All of these three peoples, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, hate being mistaken for one another by Westerners, and they are all extremely different. You cannot just throw everyone together in a porridge and expect anything coherent to emerge, pretending that it is an authentic depiction of one of the most subtle aspects of Japanese culture. Apparently, the lack of authenticity is evident everywhere you look with sets and costumes and hair and gestures, and even the music is Chinese. It was wonderful to hear Yo-yo Ma playing the cello (but he is of course Chinese) and Yitzhak Perlmann playing the violin. John Williams wrote a good film score, but it was not Japanese of course. There were also some idiotic moments in the film, such as a raging fire which suddenly stops because the script says it should. If only fires responded to command like that in real life! There are wonderful, magic moments in the film, and deeply moving performances, - Chinese performances. Gong Li, in particular, was magnificent as a woman possessed by insane envy and capable of anything. (I wouldn't want to meet her in the dark in either a Japanese or a Chinese alley.) Japanese culture is deeply mysterious to all of us who have not lived there, and there are many unpleasant aspects to it (the latest statistics say that one Japanese commits suicide every 15 minutes!). No one outside Japan really understands geishas, and I can only presume and hope that the Japanese themselves do (perhaps they do not). What is a geisha? I have seen this film and still do not know. As for people selling their children, that we can understand, and it is a really disgusting way to start a movie. There are many disgusting aspects to this story, and I wonder how many of those aspects are authentic, and how many are fantasy. This was a lost opportunity to try to tell the world who and what the Japanese are, if they themselves know (maybe their suicide rate indicates that they are not certain, or perhaps they know too well). The Japanese have a xenophobia problem, and as long as they go on refusing to apologise for their massacres and war crimes, they will remain one of the world's most hated peoples.

In addition, she is torn from her sister and further learns of the petty cruelties and jealousies between one generation of Japanese women and another. The film explains that unlike the West, who believed Geishas were courtesans, these beautiful and highly cultured Japanese women were talented in many respects. The movie may seem a bit tedious and slow in several parts, but that is because of the black and gloomy atmosphere the young girl grows up in. Later in her life, Chiyo finds love, kindness and understanding in the presence of a man called Chairman (Ken Watanabe). A superior performance by Watanabe, who usually plays heavies.

It's got pure star power, a competent director (Rob Marshall), a fantastic and mystical score by John Williams, and it's adapted from the acclaimed novel by Arthur Golden. In the months since it was released, I was not bothered by the casting of Chinese actresses in roles meant for Japanese women, and I've been reading up on geisha and while it may take several viewings, it would be wise to not look at this picture as a factual account of the geisha world. The movie looks great (so does Ziyi Zhang as the heroine Sayuri - not hot - but beautiful, and not in a sexual way either), is enchantingly beautiful, but as some would put, is pretty empty. What we've got here in ""Memoirs of a Geisha,"" is Cinderella retold in the passionate, difficult world of the geisha (translated means ""artist"" or ""person of the arts) and features Ms. Zhang, in her first English-speaking American performance, who transcends her fishing-village roots and becomes Japan's top person of the arts. She's initiated into the geisha world by Michelle Yeoh but faces stiff competition from a nasty rival (Gong Li), and wishes for the affections of The Chairman (Ken Watanabe). The movie is pretty empty plot-wise, but the world we know little about becomes the forefront of this picture. The obscure sexuality of the geishas is explored to some troubling depths, but the performers are able to lift it out of mediocrity.

Obviously, that did not happen even though it did get its Geisha kicks by receiving a few technical Golden Boys for Art Direction, Costume Design, and Cinematography: the film was worthy of those recognitions. The epico piece centers around Chiyo/Sayuri. Chiyo is an abandoned Japanese child who gets sold to a Geisha clan who treat her like Jap, I mean crap. Chiyo's eventual Geisha mentor Mameha rescues her from the ""Dark Side Geisha Abuse"" and shows Chiyo as a young woman the true ways of a Geisha. Chiyo then becomes a well-sought Geisha renamed Sayuri. She longs for the love of the Chairman, a well-respected Japanese businessman who was nice to Chiyo as a sad little girl. However, I did ponder what she saw in him; because even though he was gentlemanlike, he had a uninspiring demeanor which made him more like the ""Chairman of the Bored"". Sayuri's primary Geisha nemesis is the odious Hatsumomo. Her conniving ways made her more of a ""Hatesomomore"" then a Hatsumomo. Ziyi Zhang sang the right ""Turning Japanese"" acting tunes as Chiyo/Sayuri and Li Gong did not gong as devilishly wicked Hatsumomo. However, I was not too austerely impressed with the monotonic performances as Ken Watanabe as the Chairman and Michelle Yeoh as Mameha.

35,Chris_Docker,A tantalising taste of something it's not,6,6 January 2006,"It would be lovely to find a beautiful verse for the spirit of a Geisha's Memoirs.The butterfly is perfuming - It's wings in the scent - Of the orchid.This haiku (a 17 syllable epigrammatic verse) by one of Japan's greatest poets (Basho Matsuo) seems at first glance to have little to it. So runs much of Japanese art, perfected to painstaking rules, yet requiring a degree of learning simply to appreciate, soul-piercing when understood. In Memoirs of a Geisha, we must be forgiven for expecting a glimpse, some aid to understanding, some hint of passion, for the difficult-to-fathom and obscure world of Japan, of geisha, representatives of artistic excellence and recipients of passionate devotion, and maybe some reference to what was a less glamorous side to their institution (and one personified in the Western stereotype).The filmmakers went to considerable lengths - top Asian actors, a decorated director and cinematographer, music by the multi-accoladed John Williams; and the film follows on from the hugely successful novel. So does it stand up?Firstly, it is visually stunning, not only with rural and urban scenery rarely seen in the West but with impressive use of colour and lighting. In one scene, as Sayuri makes her debut in a leading part at the theatre, we are treated to a fabulous dramatic entrance suggesting classical posture and make-up. It is the bright lights and fast cameras that director Rob Marshall used to such effect in Chicago. We follow a young girl from the time she is sold by her parents, through her apprenticeship and graduation as a geisha, and then through the onset of war and its aftermath. It has the exotic appeal of, say, the King and I or other successful movies that use an unknown culture to bring spice to a simple love story. It will delight many audiences. But as anything more serious it plummets as fast as a wingless bird.Although there are moments of tension, such as the theatre performance, the sumo wrestling match or the jealous rage of a competitor geisha, much of the pacing (especially in the first third) is lacklustre, like someone telling a story at a continuous speed (much of the background is told in voice-over). Opportunities for dramatic excitement are easily missed with such a format. Telling the story takes much time: there is little left for character development, so it is hard to identify with the pain and triumphs of even our heroine. A very modest brush with Japanese culture shows this movie lacks authenticity in its most crucial aspects. You cannot cast a film star in a part that requires a lifetime study or the equivalent of a university degree without considerable technical finesse. It would be like asking Richard Gere to dance a couple of scenes from Nureyev. But it gets worse. Everyday details are sloppy and unreflective of Japanese culture. Most obvious perhaps, the make-up employed by the film's 'geisha' is instantly recognisable as quite ordinary, not the sort that takes hours to apply.In A Beautiful Mind, director Ron Howard took a mysterious subject (mathematics) and made it exciting to non-mathematicians. Other directors have dealt similarly with obscure arts or strange worlds and let us glimpse hitherto unknown regions, often adding a love story for good measure. Producer Steven Spielberg however, (in the film's production notes) confesses to a different objective: ""I was very moved by the love story, by the rivalry . . . and by the test of friendship."" Japanese culture is mentioned only in passing. The aim was not to introduce us to something new but something that's ""relevant to people in every county.""They gave up before they started. Instead of highly developed Japanese traditions, we get lowest common denominators, and even the 'love story' fails to pass muster as the context (a society in those days of arranged marriages) is imperfectly explained. It could be in America  just change the country, add a mix of oriental costumes and languages, plus homage to a well-known book (and lots of highly paid talent that sadly lacks artistic integrity) and you have a winning Hollywood formula.It is one thing to 'include' lurid details such auctioning a maidenhead  it is another thing altogether to miss the main point.But has the movie really missed such an opportunity? It might be worth examining, even to see if this film is actually an insult to Japanese culture.Ancient Japanese entertainers would perform for the nobility and some females even became concubines to the emperor. The first female geisha were simply dancers or musicians. They soon became popular enough to be able to steal clients from courtesans. They flourished as artists and entertainers and soon became fashion leaders  a bit like western 'supermodels.' In today's Japan, geishas are accorded considerable respect for their accomplishments and what they represent. Being in the presence of a geisha is a remarkable experience  as if royalty had suddenly walked into the room, one feels thrown against the wall with a sense of awe. A man simply seeking a beautiful courtesan or a mere hostess could find one at a fraction of the price.Memoirs of a Geisha is a tantalising taste of something it's not. It neither informs nor satisfies, but entertains sumptuously if simplistically. It will please many less discerning audiences as well as critics or award voters who review a movie by means of DVD  it has a lush play of colour that will transfer to the small screen together with a low attention-span requirement that allows you to make the coffee. But it is about as far from the memoirs of any geisha as the instant coffee will be from the beautiful ritual of the Japanese tea ceremony. The film, like a Japanese haiku, doesn't seem to have much to it: unlike a Japanese haiku though, it really doesn't.",Memoirs of a Geisha
36,Nazi_Fighter_David,"""She dances, she sings. She entertains you, whatever you want. The rest is shadow. The rest is secret.""",8,19 February 2006,"""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is a love story that remains tedious and distant from being an epic love story on scale with Casabalanca, Dr. Zhivago, or even Titanic The story follows one particular Japanese peasant girl whose father sends her and her sister to a famous geisha house Her less attractive sister is sent away to a house of prostitution, and Chiyo is given domestic tasks until the time when she can be trained to be a geisha.Naturally, the main appeal of the film is the glimpse into the true nature of the geisha How a geisha becomes a pinnacle of elegance and class, a master of entertainment and a royal agent of many gentle graces, how she sells her skills and not her body, how she can be the keeper of traditional arts, and how she can stop a man in his tracks with only one look Yet the film postulates that a geisha's ultimate goal is her debut as a flamboyant dancer, sell her virginity, and pride herself on being well paid for itThe film's photography is outstanding, the music score is inventive, the editing is concise and timed perfectly, and Ziyi Zhang overflows with sensitivity, delicacy, and sensuality Zhang has ""the sea in her eyes.""

37,noralee,"Stiff, Beautiful Looking But Boring Melodrama",3,8 January 2006,"""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is a visually stunning melodrama that seems more like a camp, drag queen satire than anything to do with real people.The first half of the film defensively keeps insisting that geishas are neither prostitutes nor concubines, that they are the embodiment of traditional Japanese beauty. But other than one breathtaking dance, the rest of the movie degenerates into ""Pretty Baby"" in Storyville territory, or at least Vashti and Esther in the Purim story, as all the women's efforts at art and artifice are about entertaining much, much older, drunken boorish men. Maybe it is Japanese culture that is being prostituted, and not just to the American louts after World War II.Perhaps it's the strain of speaking in English, but Ziyi Zhang shows barely little of the great flare she demonstrated in ""House of Flying Daggers (Shi mian mai fu)"" and ""Hero (Ying xiong)."" Michelle Yeoh occasionally gets to project a glimmer of her assured performance in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Wo hu cang long)."" Only Li Gong shows any real life. Otherwise, I kept picturing Charles Ludlam in various roles, or even Cillian Murphy, as in kabuki theater, particularly as the plot dragged down in cat fight after cat fight.The supposed love story has zero chemistry, mostly due to the age differences, and I mostly felt sorry for Ken Watanabe and hoped his Hollywood pay check compensated for his loss of dignity as the mysterious ""Chairman."" I remember more emotion in ""Portrait of Jennie"" as the young girl is anxious to grow up into Jennifer Jones to please Joseph Cotton.We see brief glimpses of reality when the geishas pose with regular women as photographic attractions, and as an ageless Ziyi Zhang lives out the war years in a very colorful kimono dying operation. The finale has little sense of normality.The score includes many chopped up traditional melodies, with cello by Yo Yo Ma and violin by Yitzhack Pearlman instead of traditional instrumentation, that are beautiful to listen to in accompaniment to the lovely cinematography, as long as one completely ignores the plot and stiff acting.As my mind wandered, I wondered how the great Japanese directors of samurai movies would have dealt with this story, which probably would have been more formal, but a lot more emotional.",Memoirs of a Geisha

39,EUyeshima,Entertaining and Evocative But Also Episodic and Sometimes Cursory Look at One Geisha's Life,7,17 December 2005,"Taken on its own terms, this sumptuously appointed 2005 film has an epic sense of melodrama that is quite fulsome and entertaining. The most impressive aspects of Arthur Golden's 1997 source novel, however, are the subtlety of the time-spanning narrative and the meticulous sense of detail and timing around the apprenticeship of a geisha. Director Rob Marshall takes inevitable shortcuts in his film adaptation to accommodate the 144-minute running time, and for me at least, the pacing feels somewhat off with a bit too much time spent on the shadowy, Dickensian childhood scenes and not enough time on the fascinating minutiae of the actual geisha training.Otherwise fairly faithful to the book, the plot follows the life of Chiyo, at first a nine-year old Japanese girl who is sold by her desperate father into slavery along with her older sister Satsu. Because of the unusual gray color of her eyes, Chiyo is sold to an okiya in Kyoto, i.e., a boardinghouse for geishas, while her sister is sold into prostitution elsewhere. Chiyo uses any means she can to reunite with her sister, but she is constantly defeated and punished by the okiya mother until Mameha, a legendary geisha of the hanamachi (geisha district) takes an interest in developing Chiyo into a geisha. Chiyo undergoes a grueling but relatively speedy apprenticeship, and men become bewitched by her poise and subservient manner.Taking a new name, Sayuri, to symbolize her metamorphosis into a professional geisha, she also gains a vindictive adversary in beautiful but spiteful Hatsumomo, the okiya's star geisha. In fact, Sayuri surpasses Hatsumomo in stature, but her victory is short-lived as Japan is in the midst of war and the entire hanamachi is evacuated. Fortunes are lost, but the post-WWII American occupation brings new and not entirely welcome opportunities. This is where both the book and movie drag somewhat since the plot machinations evolve into more of a generic soap opera of compromise and comeuppance. Fortunately, Marshall - along with co-screenwriters Robin Swicord and Doug Wright  excise the book's long denouement of Sayuri moving to New York to run a salon for visiting Japanese businessmen.Unsurprisingly, the film's period detail is impressive, even though it was mostly shot here in California with Kyoto's Gion district recreated in Thousand Oaks (I would agree that the current Gion district looks too modern and commercial to be used effectively now). A bevy of first-rate talent has been recruited to develop the evocative atmosphere of mid-century Japan - John Myhre's production design, Colleen Atwood's costumes (the kimonos are indeed exquisite), Dion Beebe's cinematography and John Williams' evocative music score are all stunning contributions.The movie is dominated by the three female leads, none Japanese, but their individual talents and combined star wattage allay any major miscasting error. Ziyi Zhang certainly looks the part of Sayuri, virginal yet seductive, and she plays the central role with requisite quietude. With her shopworn beauty and throaty voice, Michelle Yeoh fully captures the meditative wisdom of Mameha, as she seems completely credible as the hanamachi's leading geisha. A stunning beauty that threatens to cause an imbalance to the story, Gong Li is a knockout as Hatsumomo with a gift for conveying venal behavior that makes you want to know more about her character.Because of the decision to have the dialogue almost completely in English (instead of subtitled), Yeoh comes off the smoothest, while both Zhang and Li seem at times to be speaking a little too phonetically to be fully immersed in their roles. Ken Watanabe makes a charismatic Chairman, the object of Sayuri's lifelong desires, though his scenes feel a bit truncated. Other roles are presented in rather broad strokes - Kôji Yakusho is suitably gruff and insensitive as Nobu; Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa brings a nicely sinister edge to the Baron; Youki Kudoh undergoes the most dramatic transformation as the secondary apprentice geisha, Pumpkin; and Kaori Momoi is coldly effective as the mercenary okiya mother with the forever-propped cigarette.Although I enjoyed the film and don't mind the Oscar-baiting nature of the approach here, a part of me does wish that a Yasujiro Ozu or a Mikio Naruse were still alive to do an own adaptation of the book, as I feel their subtle, native Japanese film-making techniques could have brought a more authentic feeling to the film. I can only imagine what a Setsuko Hara or a Machiko Kyô could have done with the role of Sayuri in their prime, but I'm just happy Marshall and company have brought Golden's book to the screen with such dedicated if a bit overly commercial spirit.",Memoirs of a Geisha
40,MarieGabrielle,Beautiful imagery...,10,28 December 2011,"It is not often American audiences see the cinematography and art direction we see here. It is effective, ephemeral and intriguing. There are not many recent Hollywood films I can say that about, not since film-noir, in fact.Gong Li as Hatsuyama is stunning and effective as an older geisha, jealous of the young Sayuri (Ziyi Zhang) who is adopted at a geisha house at the age of 9 after the untimely death of her mother.The young actress playing Sayuri is wide-eyed and innocent, sadly lost. there is a beautiful scene where she meets The Chairman (well portrayed by Ken Watanabe). He takes to her and buys her a cherry plum ice...the colors of the bridges and Japanese foliage are evocative and affecting. Other-worldly, and the audience is transported into the world of 1930's Japan.Michelle Yeoh is lovely as the gentler geisha, Mameha, who bids for Sayuri to mentor her and train her in dance and customs of the true geisha. Filming of her, very soft and aesthetic, as she teaches Sayuri to utilize her body as an art form. There is also a noteworthy cinematic performance stage directed very artistically and originally.Then we see the World War and how it affects and changes the beautiful cities of Japan. It becomes dusty and down-trodden. The visuals and costumes are amazing...very highly recommended for an original view into this time period in Japan and its culture. 10/10",Memoirs of a Geisha

42,triple8,Moments of magnificence,7,19 May 2006,"SPOILERS THROUGH: I finally saw this and thought it was well above average, if not perfect. I think there was such an enormous buzz generated by this film that people were maybe expecting absolute perfection. I know I originally was although after hearing a lot of lackluster reviews I actually went into this expecting something not so great so I was pleasantly surprised to discover it was actually very good. In my opinion memoirs was neither a bad movie or a masterpiece, it was something in between, although it did have some moments of utter and complete magnificence.The things I liked include the visuals which as many have mentioned were lovely. This film was beautiful to look at and I also was intrigued by the story itself and found it both complex and very moving. The performers were all very good and the sweetness of the main character gets you involved. It's an emotional and very poignant story and I wish I'd seen it in the theater.That being said, there were some things that really prevented me from finding this to be outstanding and took the movie down a little. One was the length. It's not necessarily that the film was to long, it's just that so much was covered and crammed into that time, that it's both distracting and very difficult to follow. Sometimes a storyline would be developed and then suddenly dropped in the next scene and something entirely new would develop. I think there was plenty of CHARACTER development but not necessarily enough STORY development. I'd have liked to see less jumping around and more focus on a few choice events because it did seem like the movie was cramming to much into the story and it didn't flow well. Maybe it could have been a little shorter as well. It was also REALLY difficult to follow and that made it difficult to enjoy the film to it's fullest potential.I also found it difficult to hear a lot of what was being said. It seemed like people were speaking to softly or something and that to interfered with the enjoyment aspect. But I was so intrigued by the movie I , eventually, was able to enjoy it anyway.But the biggest disappointment was where the story's focus was-or wasn't. We do not get to see much of the world of Geisha, it seems half the film is the Geisha training and a lot of the movie revolves around the arguing between the Geishas. Shouldn't we have gotten more of a Sense of the individuals themselves and got a sense of the lifestyle they all wanted so badly? That was a genuine surprise to me.I also did not really think the love story was developed enough and the war is merely touched upon as well, though one plus is the movie's ability to show the difference between the Geisha before the war and after. That was actually done well.So....there were pluses and minuses. Basically I really thought the movie focused to much on things it didn't need to and not enough on things it should have. In spite of that, there were moments of magnificence and I'd definitely recommend it for viewing as long as one doesn't go into it thinking their going to see the a perfect flawless picture. I'd call this an above average, though not excellent film with moments of complete magnificence. I'd also rate it a 7.5 out of 10.",Memoirs of a Geisha
43,nycritic,Cinderella of the Far East,7,22 January 2006,"Asian dramas -- even the ones involving fantasy fighting -- have a certain lushness and a complex texture that I believe only Asian directors can truly capture. So having Rob Marshall, a very American director, step in, is a risk, and for two-thirds of the picture he mutes the frenetic editing and lurid visuals used in CHICAGO, slows the pace of the narration, and achieves the goal in making his vision look as authentic as possible.MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA has a lot of Charles Dickens in its storyline. The tale of Chiyo, the little girl who is sold by her mother to a geisha house, her trials and tribulations, her knowledge and yearning of true love and success as a geisha is almost identical to the Dickensian universe. It even evolves in a similar manner, and its more effective moments are the ones involving Chiyo as a girl (Suzuka Ohgo) becoming friends (and later enemies) with Pumpkin, not understanding why she is in this strange house, why she has been separated from her sister whom she frantically tries to seek out, or why the geisha Hatsumomo (Gong Li) is so mean to her. One touching scene, which becomes the focus of Chiyo's drive, is when she encounters this ""prince"" of a man, the Chairman (Ken Watanabe). The smile he coaxes out her sad face is the most luminous moment in the entire film, and this event makes Chiyo want to become a better person and reunite with the Chairman. They do meet later on, but the movie mutes their romance after she becomes the geisha Sayori (Zhang Ziyi), and in trying to keep him distant in a casual way -- they don't share as much as a stilted conversation -- somewhat works against the believability of their mutual but restrained love.What does work is the subtext within the relationships between the two other women and Sayori, intended or not. Hatsumomo explodes in rage against Sayori after being successfully put down the night of her debut that has hints a little of repressed lesbianism. Notice the way Hatsumomo lashes out like a snake: it also seems as if she would be ready to kiss her at any second. Also noteworthy is the relationship that Sayori develops with her mentor Mameha (Michelle Yeoh). I loved it because I've seen Ziyi and Yeoh play rivals in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON and it was great to see them interact in a completely different way, one that indicates Mameha was the replacement for the sister Sayori lost, one who also lost a chance at love and happiness, and who only knows the life of a geisha.Where the film falters, somewhat, is in trying to tie in all of the story lines once the last half hour arrives. The invasion of World War II, while intending to show how times change and traditions morph, somehow didn't work on film as it must have on paper. I also felt that Pumpkin's late introduction as a very American-friendly whore with double intentions could have been handled better and seemed to belong in another movie with comic overtones. Granted that her character had becomes, as the mistress of the geisha house had predicted, Hatsumomo's puppet via her actions, but I felt it slowed the story down a little. Another character who did an about-face was Nobu's (Koji Yakusho). There was little-to-no indication he had any interest in Sayori and more than once he rebuffed her or looked bored by her. His sudden declaration of love comes too abrupt and I didn't quite buy it. But it's the problem with staying too close to the source material: sometimes you have to tweak it a little while maintaining its essence.As usual, there is some fantastic subtle acting from the three leading ladies, all film veterans in their native China and Malaysia, as well as in Ken Watanabe and Koji Yakusho. Yes, it's thirty minutes too long. Yes, the love story is marginal at best. And yes, it would have benefited better had it been done in its native tongue with subtitles, but that would have been at the expense of it having limited availability. However, it is a sumptuous, gorgeous film about the triumph of the spirit of this one girl against the odds around her. And it even has a happy ending.",Memoirs of a Geisha
44,eric262003,Nicely Done Film With Stimulating Performances,9,26 March 2012,"After reading the novel that this movie was adapted from, it really was a treat that I enjoyed the book immensely. Therefore, I had high expectations when I first saw the movie. And surely enough, it lived up to my expectations as it followed the book very precisely and never once did it cut corners. ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is authentic in its beauty and its colors and the in depth look at the Geisha's as they followed their routines and the beautiful faces that these divas possess is something that cannot be ignored. The cinematography was so beautiful it is like a travel brochure coming to life as we come to marvel and appreciate the beautiful countryside of Japan, the ancient customs, the art, the food and the way of life that Japanese people have been practising for centuries.The film centers around young lady named Chiyo (Sayuri) a young lady from the Land of the Rising Sun who's has reached a momentous milestone in her life by being the leading geisha girl in Japan before World War II. There was some clash in culture differences in which the setting and characters in the story were from Japan, but the the leading cast performers were Chinese. Sure I understand the friction in that perspective, but I'm not going to lose any any sleep over that. In fact no one should truly be offended by anything you see. It's like a straight performer play throwing themselves into their roles to play gay characters and vice-versa (Rock Hudson). I've seen 30 year old adults play teenagers and 40 year old performers play 25 years. It's all about the art of acting and it's the director's responsibility to choose the right performer to play the role that's chosen for them and to be the best in living the roles they're starring in regardless of what culture or nationality they are.The characters succeeded in doing that and did not in any shape or form disappoint. Ziyi Zhang, Li Gong and Michelle Yeoh really threw their acting chops at us and turned in some of the best performances in 2005. They all produced great details and subtext into their respected roles and were truly fun to watch. There were some naysayers who ranted that this film had a bit of a Western agenda brought into the fold as all the characters were talking English over Japanese. But the reality of this movie was that the author was written, not by a Japanese novelist, but by an American from Tennessee.

46,winner55,All things Chinese,5,15 April 2007,"A solid script, great acting, beautiful photography - and one of the most ill-advised, misguided fabrications of history I've ever seen.This is the second American film about Japan (the first being The Last Samurai) that just goes to show that American filmmakers know exactly zip about Japan.I have been a fan of Japanese and Chinese cinema since I first saw ""The Seven Samurai"" at the tender age of fourteen. The next year ""The Chinese Connection"" played like ten weeks at the old Coronet Theater on Main Street, where you could smoke and drink beer - I must have seen it a four or five times with an older friend of mine - it ruined my health but opened my mind.Because most Americans are at best culturally myopic when they're not directly xenophobic, this film will accomplish exactly what its producers hoped - raking in bucks from recently acquired fans of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""House of the Flying Daggers"" - both extremely beautiful films from China. The trouble here is, ""Geisha"" is set in Japan. So one would imagine that this could be the film that commented on life in Japan, utilizing Japanese motifs in the way the Chinese films utilized Chinese motifs. No such luck.Here's the real news - Every gesture, every mannerism, every expression of passion, every bow of the head is completely, undeniably Chinese. Not surprising since most of the major actors are from China. The whole attitude of the film towards things Japanese is Chinese to the core - even the hair-styles are Chinese variants of Japanese, when they're not just flat out completely Chinese (as some are).Someone forgot to mention to the Americans involved in this film that the Chinese are not particularly fond of the Japanese or their culture - so when you take advice on Japan from a Chinese, your point of view tends to get a little skewered.But here's the final insult, as far as I'm concerned - the MUSIC is Chinese! (Chinese and Japanese music conventions are very different.)Who would dare make a film about Japan with Chinese motifs lilting away in the background? Obviously someone who doesn't know and doesn't care.The filmmakers decided in advance that they knew Asia, or if they didn't, they would decide what Asia should be like for American audiences.A real insult. To the Japanese, but also to American audiences. To the great Chinese actresses who made this film what it is: Look, I love you - but let's play fair, even with the Japanese, hey?",Memoirs of a Geisha

I will not enter in discussion about this,but I do think people should worry less with this kind of stuff.''Memoirs of a Geisha'' remembers me in some way ''Heaven & Earth'', because they both are about an Asian female woman, already older, telling the story of their lives, and all the problems and the hard time they had to pass through life,until they find a success or/ and real happiness. The fact that both facts are during the second war also helps to the similarities, and people who liked this movie maybe will also enjoy ''Heaven & Earth''.The young Chiyo and her sister Satsu, are separated from their home and are sold to different places. Satsu is sold to a ''pleasure house'' where she will become a prostitute,and Chiyo, with a better luck because of her looks, is sold to a Geisha house. Their mother was already sick, and died just after they were sold. The same happened to their father,making both girls orphans. One day, Chiyo finds Satsu in one of the ''pleasure houses'' and they both combine to see each other near a bridge, to run away. The problem is that Chiyo stayed locked in the Geisha house, and her sister run away alone. Without any family and needing to pay her debts,young Chiyo works as a servant in the Geisha house, until the day she mets the chairman, a kind man who will be forever in her dreams, and will give her the straight to become the most famous geisha of her city.But many things will happen before Chiyo's dream starts to realize, not to mention the war, who will change Japan forever...aka ""Memórias de uma Gueixa"" - Brazil",Memoirs of a Geisha

50,DeeNine-2,Beautiful but somehow incomplete,8,27 January 2007,"In Arthur Golden's beautiful novel from which this movie was adapted there is the sense that the geisha exists in a fairytale world removed from harsh reality. Even though the kimonos have their seamy side that is not for us to see. The fact that Chiyo was sold into slavery and then charged for room and board and for her education in the pleasing arts, is made clear to the audience, and yet the treatment of the story is very much that of a fairytale. Chiyo is a Cinderella kind of character, beautiful, graceful, tactful and intelligent, courageous, morally correct and even heroic.This is a good thing and perhaps why the producers worked so hard to get a PG-13 rating. And maybe it is a good thing that such a movie may be seen by teenaged girls and can afterwards discuss the movie with their mothers. The geisha as a role model...And then again perhaps I am too harsh. My problem is that what made the novel so interesting, so much a work of art beyond its commercial success was the fine line that Golden walked between the fairytale and the reality, between the preserving and the selling of Chiyo/Sayuri's virginity, between her rising above the life of a fishmonger's daughter and that of becoming someone who sells herself to the highest bidder. In the movie this play between the fantasy and the reality is not sufficiently realized. Certainly director Rob Marshall tried. But I think the movie falls short of its potential mainly because the contrast was not made sharp enough. Or perhaps I have become jaded and don't realize that the harsh realities only need to be alluded to.At any rate, the geisha's story (told in the first person by the geisha as an older woman looking back--Shizuko Hoshi does the voice over) is a strange and touching story of love spanning decades and ending in happiness and fulfillment. But primarily it is a fairy tale, and like all fairy tales there is beneath the surface an underlying current of the dark nature of humanity that can only be glimpsed through the use of symbolism. Just as the wolf in grandmother's bed represents something more than a wolf, so it is with the men attended by the geisha. And so it is with her as well. She projects the image of fairytale beauty and an attentive loveliness, but is in fact a woman of business whose attentions are bought and sold, just as with any commodity. This is the illusion and the pretense, and the soft, embroidered veil between us and the truth that is paid for.At one point in the film Mameha (Michelle Yeoh) who is mentoring Chiyo tells her that ""we are geishas not courtesans. We sell our skills not our bodies."" No doubt this is true to some very real extent. It is also true that courtesans sell more than their bodies and even common street walkers might be looked upon as workers in a sex industry or even as physical therapists.When I wrote the review for the book some years ago I speculated that this might be made into a epic quality movie, and indeed it was rumored that Steven Spielberg was to direct. I even thought that in might be made into a Broadway musical or even an opera (and it still might). Such is the familiar yet universal appear of the central psychology of the story, that of a young and beautiful, but ordinary girl being thrown into an alien culture, where she experiences abuse, jealousy and unrequited love, but manages to triumph over such antagonists.The direction by Rob Marshall, who directed the award-winning musical Chicago (2002), is competent with a nice emphasis on grace and beauty, which is certainly appropriate. Especially excellent was the final scene. It is touching and Ziyi Zhang plays her part to perfection. However I didn't like the blue lenses that she had to wear (and I understand she didn't like them either!). I realize that her eyes were supposed to provoke a sense of a ""water person,"" but I think that could have been achieved without the artificiality of the lenses. They were particularly grotesque in the final scene with its lengthy close up.Li Gong (or Gong Li--this is the Chinese way in which the last name goes first, or so I am told) was outstanding as always as Hatsumomo, the mean geisha who is jealous of Chiyo; and Suzuka Ohgo who played Chiyo as a little girl was adorable and did an excellent job. Ken Watanabe as The Chairman captured the sense of a wise and compassionate statesman very well, and Koji Yakusho as Nobu was entirely believable as a man of strength and character.In the final analysis I guess the reason I was not thrilled with the movie is that I thought there was something lost in the adaptation, a subtlety of artistic intent and purpose to show an entire life both before and after World War II, from the time of the Emperor through the hardships that everybody had to endure as the rising sun set. Perhaps this works better in a 400-page novel than in a 145-minute movie. On the other hand maybe it is just that I read the book first. Some people say it is better to read the book first because you are then able to form your own idea of what the characters look like. Others say it is better to see the movie first because when you read the book the greater depth that is usually there is better appreciated.Anyway, this is an excellent movie although not the masterpiece it might have been.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",Memoirs of a Geisha
51,schappe1,A great director from out of nowhere,9,2 January 2006,"Rob Marshall has come out of nowhere, (just some non-descript TV work) to direct two of the major films of the decade and do a superb job with each of them, ""Chicago"" and ""Memoirs of a Geisha"". The interesting thing is that the films have little in common, being totally different genres and in totally different settings. However there are two things that relate them other than Marshall's involvement. One is that they both feature ""All About Eve"" stories of an ambitious young woman unseating a more established one. That's coincidental, although they reveal Marshall's capacity to direct top actresses in stories about women, a rarity in today's male-dominated market. The other similarity is that both films are based on highly regarded source material from another medium. Devotees of the original tend to look at a film version of their treasure with suspicion but it's hard to believe they have anything to object to here, (although some are trying, mightily).The performances of all the women and men in the film are uniformly excellent, especially young Suzuka Ohgo. Marshall knows the value of the human face in telling a story- especially these faces. Yet he also knows how to properly pace a movie, which, by the very name, needs to ""move"". The problem I have had with the movies from the Orient in recent years that have played in the US, (most of them have been from China), is their deadly pacing. Many of Gong Li's earlier films feature stories of young women trying to find a place for themselves in a male-dominated society, (""Raise the Red Lantern"" was the first I saw). She doubtless would have had the lead role in this a decade ago. Those films were impressive but ultimately sleep-inducing. This is one of the best edited films I have ever seen, pausing at the right moments but using montages sequences and quick cuts when needed as well.I understand some more prominent directors thought of taking a stab at this story before Marshall got the assignment. They could not have made it a better movie than he did and he will now ascend to their level with this one.",Memoirs of a Geisha
52,KUAlum26,A Tough Sell,7,5 June 2006,"Given the kind of controversy this film drew(mostly out of casting Chinese actresses to play Japanese women)and the fact that this film has very little sex,barely any violence,is set amongst the backdrop of pre and post-war Japan and has a very familiar ring of being a ""female empowerment"" film,it's kind of a wonder that Miramax still sought to green-light this for a major release,let alone during the Christmas film rush. I didn't catch how well this film fared financially,but I'm under the impression that my misgivings bore out.That's kind of a shame,too. While I wouldn't say that this movie was really my cup of tea(no pun to those who've sen the film!),I did feel rewarded by watching this,if for nothing else because I greatly enjoyed the lush visuals and the performances by the erstwhile-only-known-for-action epics actresses Ziyi Zhang and Michelle Yeoh.The Geisha in question is one Chiyo(Zhang),who as a little girl is sold,with her sister,into a Geisha house by her indebted father. What proceeds from there is a miserable existence as the charge of impatient elders and the unmerited antipathy of an older Geisha(Gong Li). Until she meets the charming Chairman(Ken Watanabe)and goes under the tutelage of a sage Geisha(Yeoh),she has little to salve her sense of being lost. Even her friendship with the fragile other lost girl she meets(Youki Kudoh)as she is dropped into the house. But after she accepts her destiny as a Geisha--and learns to understand just what being a geisha truly means--she rises in security,popularity and even influence--does she reaches some level of peace with her lot in life. Only her requited love for the Chairman stick with her,and poses the greatest threat to her control.Director Rob Marshall,just off helming Chicago,employs a great usage of color and style. The story--an adaptation of an Arthur Golden novel--is effectively retold as a personal narrative through Robin Swicord's script. It may be a tough sell or tough buy as a film(regardless of the mostly positive critical reviews),but once you rent it(and I imagine IF you have ANY curiosity about it,you probably will),I feel like you'll most likely appreciate it. I know I did.",Memoirs of a Geisha
53,xredgarnetx,Where's Jerry Lewis when we need him?,7,12 September 2007,"All kidding aside, MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA is a lush and, one would suppose, fairly expensive adaptation of a popular novel about a Japanese waif who grows up to become a legendary geisha before World War II comes along to ruin everything. The waif's impoverished parents sell her to a middleman who in turn sells her to a geisha house, where she is trained in the art of the geisha. But this overly inquisitive, mischievous and often rebellious sprite runs afoul of the house mother and almost ends up a scullery maid before being ""rescued"" by a former geisha who bets the house mother she can turn the girl into a great geisha. Much craziness ensues, and the girl grows into a beautiful young woman who becomes in great demand as a geisha. Obviously, this is NOT a movie for men. For women, it may prove spellbinding. Or not, depending on the female. MEMOIRS is a stark and unapologetic melodrama, set in a foreign land (even though it was shot in Hollywood) that comes to an improbable although predictable conclusion (someone had to be financing the young lady's education, and who better than the man she has loved since childhood?). Director Rob Marshall, whose only known film prior to this was CHICAGO, uses a cast made up of American, Chinese, Korean and Japanese actors. To an Asian, seeing non-Japanesee actors in many of the roles, including the leads, may prove jarring. To all others, it won't matter a lick. It's the melodrama that matters, brudder. And there's plenty of it here. The only name that might be familiar to American audiences is Michelle Yeoh, as the young geisha's (apparent) benefactress. But keep a close eye on the actress who plays Pumpkin. She undergoes the most dramatic transformation of all.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Only cause it is my sister's favorite film. Every time, I complain because it is such a boring movie. It would be at least watchable if it wasn't so boring. It's an uplifting drama about a girl who was separated from her sister as a child and soon becomes a geisha or some crap like that. Also, her sister becomes a prostitute or hooker at the age of, well, I think it was 6. The problem with the film is that there isn't anything that uplifting about it. Sort of like with The Soloist. Memoirs of a geisha is a romantic drama that would be a little better if it wasn't so slow and boring. How Ken Wantanabe's character looks the same after twenty years or so raises my eyebrow. There are a few good performances, but the best one is by Gong Li. Who plays a huge bitch who blames her problems on everyone. I am sorry, but the film seems too dramatic, too dull, and too boring for my tastes. It would be a 5, but there are good performances and a good plot of some sort. I suppose it's a good love story, but it doesn't really entertain.Memoirs of a geisha:**1/2 out of ****",Memoirs of a Geisha
55,Angelus2,Beautifully shot and brings the world of the Geisha to life...,7,22 October 2008,"This is the story of a young girl who is taken away far from home along with her sister and placed into the life of a slave; a slave that will one day get the right to become a Geisha.The story is beautifully written, mainly because it was a novel and captures pre-war Japan and the different characters that inhabit this rich land. The first half of the film captures the life of Sayuri and shows her sadness as she loses her parents and her sister abandoning her, and her life with the evil Hatsumomo and her journey to become the greatest Geisha of all.The story has no structure mainly because it was originally a novel and novel can be absolutely great with no such structure, this film does get a little tiresome at one point usually after Sayuri has become a Geisha; but the landscape and camera work keep the film's strength going.Zhang Ziyi provides a satisfactory performance, she brings in the depth which is needed, but the younger Sayuri, also known as Chiyo is the show stealer in my view, she should have received the Oscar nomination.Gong Li is seductive and fierce, she provides the villainous role with menace which is much needed in this film were everything is beautiful, Michele Yeoh also provides a satisfactory performance....Ken Watanbe is very endearing as the only man who cares about the young Sayuri offering her ice...A nice drama...",Memoirs of a Geisha
56,lambiepie-2,Interesting subject matter,5,29 September 2006,"This is a nice film telling the story of the competitive world of Geisha that this young girl, Sayuri was ""thrown"" into. Her life was transformed as she was plucked/sold from her family and placed into a house run by Mother and where a very nasty attitude and competitive Geisha named Hatsumomo lived. Hatsumomo longed for having a regular life - but also seemed to revel in the fact that she was a Geisha. That was until Sayuri came into the picture and she could tell that if Sayuri was to become a Geisha, she would be strong competition - in more than just being a Geisha.Sayuri's story of those who came into her life, her benefactor (and user!) Mameha, and the one chance meeting she had with The Chairman as a child gave her a goal and meaning. Watching the growth of Sayuri into a woman, and a Geisha was interesting - especially as she secretly longed for The Chairman, as well as the beautiful sets, costumes and the bitter, bitter rivalries within the Giesha structure.The one thing I think that is important to point out is that I never read the book but I knew what a Geisha was before watching this film, and I think some who have seen this film, may have thought a Geisha was more of a concubine and could be disappointed in seeing it is not. When females became Geishas, (for it was the males were Geishas first) this was one of the most mysterious but well sought after lifestyles - and it was a hard lifestyle because beyond its mysteriousness and obvious grace and beauty, there was much for each woman to give up personally in her life to become one. Sayuri's story in this film does give perspective of all sides - beast and beauty.But...why I gave this move a middle of the road vote was not because the story wasn't interesting, it was. Also, it wasn't because of the beauty of the sets, time and people. That was nice. It definitely was not all because of the 'actors' because I feel that acting is acting. Many folks get too hung up on the nationality of the actor instead of the crafts of being an actor. An actor in a role, regardless of WHO it is, must be believable in that role, that's why they call it 'acting'. But to be honest, I did have a slight problem with this. I'm just a regular American film viewer that loves foreign films to death ever since my introduction to them through the wonderful ""Z"" channel. So, even though I'm not ""up"" on which dialect is which and can argue that, I did loose 'something' while watching this film. I felt that everyone in this film, the international Asian casting, was wonderful to see; if not all wonderful to hear. Plus, I like seeing films in an original language and this is a film that qualifies as one that could have been. I think this film SHOULD have been in Japanese, with subtitles. (For example, as a side comment - I saw ""Ba wang bie ji"" or ""Fairwell My Concubine"" in its original Chineese language with subtitles and loved it. Then, I saw it with the English dub, and while also nice, there was a lot lost in translation... Sure it's a personal preference, but for an ethnic tale an important preference.)But....what bothered me the most about this film was that it was slow, slow, slow, slow in telling the tale. The telling of this tale -- dragged. After the first hour of this film, I felt I was there for a few hours -- just to get to what I saw. The pacing was not up to par for me, and that's what brought the whole film down for me.",Memoirs of a Geisha
57,Victor Field,Memoirs of a man who saw it without reading the book.,6,4 May 2006,"Steven Spielberg was due to direct ""Memoirs of a Geisha,"" but it ended up in the hands of the man who steered Catherine Zeta Jones to an Oscar, Rob Marshall. Maybe if the bearded one (still credited as one of the producers) had stayed in the director's chair, this would have been the powerful drama it aspires to be instead of a soap opera. A beautifully designed, wonderfully shot and gorgeous to look at soap opera, true, but a soap opera nonetheless.The story of Sayuri's travels from a childhood separated from her sister to her flourishing as a geisha to her post-WWII life, Robin Swicord's script is too uneven and often too surface-skimming to successfully bring over what may well have been a more affecting story in the novel; it hits more often than it misses, and it is moving in a Sunday afternoon movie way (when we see the American soldiers in China and the debasement of the geisha world, it's hard not to feel disgusted), but Ziyi Zhang - stunning though she undoubtedly is - is a bit lost as our heroine, especially when she's appearing opposite Michelle Yeoh as the Svengali to her Trilby and/or Gong Li (energising proceedings whenever she appears, and the real star of the movie) as the eventually former leader of the clubhouse, geisha-wise.Though ZZ tries hard and never really stinks, you don't really believe she could be so captivating (which is surprising considering her previous films), whereas you never doubt for a second that Gong Li really can make men trip over their own feet just by looking at them - although ironically she never demonstrates it, the way our hero and Miss Yeoh do. Even Youki Kudoh as her best friend Pumpkin fares better.In fairness, it's not all Ziyi's fault; the movie's got style to burn but not all that much underneath, and the emotional pull the ending should have really isn't there - John Williams's score often has a better grasp of the proceedings than the filmmakers do (in addition to being almost as sumptuous as the female leads), and really should have won the Oscar instead of Gustavo Santaolalla. I'm definitely buying the soundtrack, and I look forward to seeing Ziyi Zhang again... just not in this movie. Missed opportunity, basically.",Memoirs of a Geisha

I imagine this isn't particularly authentic but that is true of many films: ""Brave Heart"", ""300"", ""The Last Samurai"", etc. It doesn't mean you can't enjoy them, they are just movies after all not teaching aids.This is an epic romance with splashes of humour and sadness and a main character it is hard not to fall in love with",Memoirs of a Geisha
59,Stampsfightclub,Dazzling appearance but narrative lets spark fade,8,13 January 2009,"Chiyo (Ohgo) grows up a slave in the house of Geishas until one day she gets the chance to become a proper Geisha.Based on Arthur Golden's novel, Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautiful and sophisticated film that is smart and entertaining but there is always something missing.After a wonderful directed Chicago, Rob Marshall directs this adaptation and is able to use his experience to create the hard drama of the story but still grab audiences through a choice of picturesque and artistic camera angles. Juxtaposed with a beautiful backdrop setting and you have a visual masterpiece. The costume design likewise couldn't be more accurate to the time the story is placed.So on paper the film has everything you could hope for. Wonderful direction, design and actors but the story telling feels inconsistent and sloppy. At first told from a narrator we have an interesting opening as a young Chiyo is whisked away from home and placed in a vastly different environment. But then that is all we hear from the narrator for a long time and getting in the mind of the central protagonist would have been such a useful advantage to the narrative.There also feels as though something is missing. Whatever tale the film tells it seems to let us out of the deeper meaning of the situation. The level of interest is always scratchy to.However when the film gets going it really gets going. From an attempted roof top escape to a seductive dance we are thrust into the life of a person who has had many vast life experiences that won't fail to intrigue the critical viewer.The representation of a Geisha is interesting. From the formalities they must follow to their prized possessions and the way they are used is as controversial and interesting as a viewer could want from a drama. Despite the bright imagery the feel of the stereotype Geisha isn't' right as it is always matched with an overly dramatic turn of events.Ziyi Zhang plays her part of the story well but Suzuka Ohgo makes a strong headway as the little girl who wants to find her sister and you can really feel her sorrow at the difficult decisions she must make.More than a coming of age device, this is a representation of the difficult acceptance of reality that is beautiful to watch.With the stunning direction, costume design and artistic feel, Memoirs of a Geisha dazzles but the spark dies with an inconsistent narrative that only occasionally relights",Memoirs of a Geisha
60,fwomp,One of the Most Beautifully Filmed Features I've Ever Seen,10,23 January 2006,"Sometimes films are excellent. Sometimes they exceed our expectations. And sometimes  just sometimes  they transcend all of that and turn into something more; they become a work of art.Such is the case with MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA directed by Rob Marshall (CHICAGO, 2002). Based on Arthur Golden's best-selling novel of the same name, this movie goes beyond cinema and transports you to another time and country.The film begins on the shores of pre-WWII Japan in a tiny fishing village where a mother lay dying. Two daughters peer between wood slats at their father as he speaks to an ominous looking man in a nice suit. Chiyo (an amazing Suzuka Ohgo) and her older sister are soon ripped away from their family and forced into a world of servitude. Chiyo's older sister is lost to houses of ill-repute, while Chiyo is pulled into a strange yet beautiful home run by a demanding ""mother"" and ""auntie."" Chiyo has entered the realm of the Geisha.Being a pretty young girl with blue eyes, Chiyo is selected to go to Geisha school. But bad blood is brewing in Chiyo's new home. A beautiful Geisha already lives there and quickly becomes jealous of Chiyo. Terrible threats and beatings ensue, and one lonely day, while Chiyo is on a bridge overlooking a river, a handsome man approaches (Ken Watanabe, THE LAST SAMURAI) with kind words and gives her some sweet ice. They chat and Chiyo is immediately enamored with him. She now has a goal. She will become the best Geisha ever so that they might meet again.As Chiyo grows and becomes more and more beautiful and wanted, the house she lives in is ready to ignite. Now fully Geisha and fully grown (Ziyi Zhang, RUSH HOUR 2), she is bribed away from Mama-san and moves in with Mameha (Michelle Yoeh, THE TOUCH) who teaches her the true nature of Geisha.World War II, other men, jealous Geisha, and years of isolation block Chiyo's plans to meet up with her first love. But through perseverance, prayer, and trust, Chiyo's wishes cannot be denied.This film is, as stated earlier, a piece of art. Every frame, every image, is carefully crafted, taking into consideration light, color, imagery, facial features, the times, and a multitude of other items I can't even begin to explain nor understand.The initial dark lighting of the film was an excellent way to start, giving us a feel for those sullen times, and also letting us know that this part of the narrators memory was fuzzy and long ago. But as the film progresses, we see brighter colors and light. By the time the film wraps up, the colors are so wondrous you feel like you could eat the screen or, at the very least, reach out and pluck this flower or that.There's been a lot of commentary about the use of Chinese actors and actresses in prime roles rather than Japanese. This is undeniably so. But it didn't detract from my enjoyment of it (have we become so self-righteous that we can't have other races playing in such roles? Does anyone remember Marlon Brando in TEAHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON?) Could the production crew have tried harder to put a Japanese native in one of those positions? Probably.

Add to those problems the fact the characters all use a phoney Japanese accent which makes it that much more difficult to understand. The photography is stunning, so much so that it gets in the way. You get the feeling at times that the acting and the story line are less important than all the pretty pictures. And why so much rain and snow? It's obviously for photographic effect. Nor were the war and the events leading to it portrayed in any meaningful way. (Oh, by the way, we just lost a 4 year war which ended with two nuclear bombs. Didn't we mention that? Sorry.) And how is it possible to justify using Chinese actors to portray Japanese, especially geishas, who are such a quintessential part of Japan's culture.

62,jluis1984,"Powerful visuals, but weak story",7,1 March 2006,"Director Rob Marshall adaptation of Arthur Golden's best-seller seems to be a movie that is either loved or hated. However, most of the attacks the film has received deal with trivial issues such as the country of origin of the lead actresses or the use of English language to tell the story.Golden's book tells a love story set in the mysterious world of the Geishas, where strict discipline and ancient traditions are the rules, and where love is forbidden. Our protagonist, Chiyo (Ziyi Zhang), is a girl that after being sold to a Geisha house by her poor family, must learn to survive in the competitive world of Geishas where she'll become the rival of the top Geisha in her house, Hatsumomo (Li Gong), and sort the troubles her undying love for a client (Ken Watanabe) will create.As Marshall's previous effort, the flamboyant award-winning musical ""Chicago"", this movie has a beautiful visual composition. The Geisha's arts are presented in a captivating way and pre-World War II Japan is also shown with supernatural beauty. The Art Design team of the movie certainly deserves to be nominated for their work here.However, this attention to the aesthetic detail is not only its biggest strength, it is also it's biggest flaw. While the book tries to give some insight in the inner world of the geisha, the film focuses on the exterior facade with flamboyant style. After Chiyo's transformation into Geisha Sayuri, we follow her training and in her performances, however, the love story and the Melodrama somehow got lost in the middle of the journey.The adaptation stays for the most part faithful to the novel, but at times it feels as if the characters have been ""simplified"" a bit too much, making them almost bi-dimensional at times. However, the cast is surprisingly good, and really make up for the problems in the script.A lot had been talked about the cast, but very few about their performances as everyone seems to be worried about the nationality of the lead actresses. Marshall's choice of Chinese actress for the three main Geishas in the film seems a dangerous one, but everything works well as their performances really are worthy.Li Gong particularly gives an outstanding performance as Chiyo's rival Hatsumomo. She is truly believable in her character, and her interpretation is so powerful that after she is gone the film seems to lose steam. Her presence on screen is huge, almost as huge as scene-stealer Michelle Yeoh, who shines in her role as Chiyo's mentor Mameha.It still is a good movie, but nowhere near masterpiece status.

It looks like a work of art and justly got Oscars for art direction, cinematography and costume design. And the music is sensational. The story is of a Japanese girl kidnapped into slavery and to be a ""geisha"" in pre-war Japan and her adventures and romantic interests. And the film in my view properly portrays how jealousy and envy can destroy people who have those emotions.However: The movie is ridiculously inaccurate, just ask any Japanese, and it has no proper basis in genuine fact, uses Chinese actors purporting to be Japanese and the players are often ludicrous with their affected and forced English language skills. Hollywood of course is not concerned with truth more with making money and the history of film has shown us many such examples and here is another one. The film makers show their contempt for the viewers as clearly they believe that the market for which this film is intended namely in the States, could not care less about truth and whether these Asians are Japs or Chinese etc. Just give them an American mannered love story and to hell with anything else. And the film producers seem to believe that having cute Asians playing a period piece version of 'desperate housewife's' along with a Cinderella and wicked witch and so on will bring in the bucks.

She and her sister Satsu are sold by her fisherman father to a geisha house in Miyako. Satsu is not accepted in the house and is sent to a brothel, and along the years, Satsu escapes from the brothel where she lived and Chiyo is left alone to become a slave of a geisha.

While still a child, Chiyo falls in love with the Chairman. Then in the post-WWII they meet each other, in a period of changes in Japan with the occupying American forces and the country completely destroyed.I never liked Hatsumomo, she's an evil little cow and a b***h!

66,Pedro_H,A tale of the East made purely for the romantic Western cinema-goer.,7,17 November 2006,"In 1930's Japan a young girl is sold in to slavery and she struggles to find her identity and some vision of true happiness.Forget director Rob Marshall (Chicago) the whole of cinema has a massive problem. For a start Western audiences (and that includes me, naturally) are often ignorant of other cultures and their history. And trying to bring them up-to-speed (in the framework of a film) is a hell of a job, if not impossible. And even that presumes the authors actually now the facts. Which I doubt in this case.This story has no graphic sex, but it is about sex, sexual slavery and women who cannot even dream beyond the state of sexual slavery. Worse this film endorses the hypocrisies and double standards of the day as cute. It says ""this is the best you can hope for."" Well I think you can hope for more - even if you are in chains!(The world of cinema often sees the world as if it is a sport - with a set of rules that all players obey. All there can be is tendencies. The geisha customer generally didn't want sex because for rich people in a poor country sex is easy and everywhere. This shows the men as being cosh while they were highly sexed - they didn't lust, they got. Sex was the TV of the day. What is worrying is the audience leaves the cinema thinking they understand something about Eastern culture and history - god help them!)This is a woman's picture, set in a man's world. We only know that the sale of a virginity is wrong because we are educated it is wrong. If we were educated it was perfectly OK we would think differently. Indeed men showed respect by paying a high price for it. To show that it wasn't the sex they could get down the road for next to nothing? Ziyi Zhang, Ken Watanabe, Michelle Yeoh, Suzuka Ohgo, Li Gong are all fine actresses who will do better work elsewhere and with directors that now more about their subject. They do well enough with this piece that could have been written by any sixth grader who had read Charles Dickens or at least knew the crowd pleasing bits of Cinderella.",Memoirs of a Geisha

69,esteban1747,The life of a geisha,7,18 January 2018,"I read the book with interest in the past, and this film is not completely faithful to the original version in the book of Arthur Golden. However, it is interesting to see the geishas, their functions in Japanese society and the limit of their intimate relationships. A geisha may have been a servant in her childhood or adolescence, but she may ascend to that position depending on her beauty and the education she received, her art for dancing, singing and even to talk and entertain the demanding patriarchy. Being Geisha is a luck in a society, where the woman is a secondary entity. At least she gets out of poverty and rubs herself into the Japanese aristocratic circle. The film exposes everything clearly with due coherence. Nice to see the performances of experienced actress Michelle Yeoh as well as others as Ziyi Zhang, Suzuka Ogo, Ken Watanabe, Li Gong and Samantha Futerman, an evidence that Rob Marshall looked for experienced Asian actors/actresses, and not only Japanese.",Memoirs of a Geisha
70,AhmedSpielberg99,There's no more than meets the eyes!,4,22 April 2020,"On the surface, everything looks splendid. And I don't just mean the stunning cinematography and the lush production design and beautiful costumes; but I also mean the interesting world the story takes place in. Unfortunately, once you dig deeper, you'd find out that this glamorous surface is almost everything the movie's got. I mean, I haven't read Arthur Golden's book, but I feel like there's more to a ""geisha"" than what I saw here. Actually, I feel like there's a decent dystopian protagonist buried underneath the kimonos and the white make-up.Keeping the shallowness of the story, that left much to be desired, and the monotony caused by the overlong runtime, that gone completely wasted in telling a well-worn story instead of exploring the promising world and developing the characters, aside, the storytelling is blatantly flawed. For it seems that the movie's concern isn't to make you emotionally invested in the characters as much as just to show off the technical prowess of the production, leaving all the turning points feel totally bland, scattered every once in a while.The first act that centers around Chiyo is enjoyable, though. I don't think the sub-plot of Chiyo and her sister moved me as much as I should, and I definitely didn't buy the awkward romance that developed from this act onwards; but I found Chiyo's ""bringing-up"" in the geisha house and her enmity with Hatsumomo, only at this point, moderately interesting.(4.5/10)",Memoirs of a Geisha

Bell, Cameron Duncan... Director Rob Marshall, Screenplay Robin Swicord.""But these are not the memoirs of an Empress, these are the memoirs of a different kind""...............Based on the best-selling book by Arthur Golden, Memoirs Of A Geisha is an emotional love story set in World War II Japan, quite a surprise from director Rob Marshall. While many critics and some audiences bashed the film for its excessive ""Madame Butterfly type"" sentimentality and pure romantic escapist nature, I thoroughly enjoyed the film as a sort of well-made Asian and American creation and an extraordinary example of fine storytelling through film. The actors are Chinese performing the role of Japanese characters (which caused a bit of controversy) but Ziyi Zhang as the eponymous Geisha, Michelle Yeoh as her mentor and Ken Wantanabe as her love interest the elusive Chairman provide outstanding performances which are in themselves reason enough to dismiss the fact they are not Japanese-born. Through an innately Asian attitude, they portray very realistic and human characters that, had they been portrayed by amateurs, would have been flat, uninteresting characters. Ziyi Zhang was not a new face in cinema. She had previously appeared in several Japanese films and would continue to do such exotic dramas as ""House of Flying Daggers"". Her experience in a variety of roles made her a very mature yet innocent and vulnerable heroine, whose eyes are the window to the world the audience observes, a world of high-class prostitution, poverty, entrapment, despair and bitterness. While the book covers far more than the film, Director Rob Marshall brings this sordid behind-the-teahouse world of social climbing among women to vivid life. The rivalry between the Geishas is strong and both of the women are portrayed in a sympathetic light, despite the fact the story seems straight out of a romantic novel with only a small degree of realism. The cinematography is a feast for the eyes- kimonos, sashes, brothel houses, American soldiers and Asian women. Japanisme is all over this film- from Chiyo's first view of the Geisha/red light district to the pretty cherry trees, lakes and bridges. It's like watching a Japanese painting of ""the floating world"". At heart, this is a love story. Sold by her parents to the life of a Geisha, Chiyo struggles against many obstacles including humiliation, abuse and the schemes of jealous rivals before becoming an accomplished Geisha. But each step she takes, each social move she makes, is her way to get to the man she loves, the elusive Chairman, who was compassionate to her when she first arrived in this seedy world. This film should have received even more critical acclaim and should have won more than one Oscar for at least one actor's performance or for director or screenplay. It's a bit evident that Rob Marshall hoped this film would create Hollywood buzz. Far from being too Hollywood (although it can seem this way too) it's a gorgeous film adaptation from a wonderful book. It's a highly moving story about love, sacrifice and a bitter struggle for happiness, attained after a long time and with a price. Fans of the novel need not feel disappointed, as they should know by now that every film version of a book is an entirely different animal. This film pays tribute to Golden's novel while at the same time luring audiences with its strong cast, lush cinematography and music by the esteemed composer John Williams, whose moody music is an elaborate combination of orchestral romantic melody and exotic, Asian musical themes. For me, this was a wonderful film for 2005, and one of the few that year I found to be irresistible. Rent it or buy it today.",Memoirs of a Geisha
72,DonFishies,"Emotionless and boring, yet visually gorgeous",6,6 May 2006,"Going into Oscar season last year, I had a clear winner in my head: Memoirs of a Geisha. Seeing the trailer in early September, it seemed to have everything going for it. It had a solid cast, it had some beautiful art direction and costumes, it was based on a bestselling book and it had Chicago's Rob Marshall at the helm. I personally hated Chicago, but the critics and Academy loved it. I missed the film, but caught the tail ends of many bad reviews. Oscar came and went, and the film ended up winning three technical awards (two of which were art direction and costume design), but the film did not end up even getting nominated for any of the top prizes. So during and after, I ask myself, what went wrong? The film takes place between the 1930's and 1940's, and chronicles the story of Chiyo/Sayuri (Zhang Ziyi), a young girl who is sold by her ailing parents to a geisha house in Japan. The film's first forty minutes chronicle her trials and tribulations as a young girl getting used to being in the geisha house, only to have the rest of the film focus on her becoming a geisha and what happens as a result.I never managed to read the book, but as it was a bestseller, I can only imagine it was not nearly as boring or emotionally shallow as Marshall's film.The film seems to go around in circles forever. Huge plot points are either barely shown, or are glazed over with something else. Elements of explanation take many minutes to explain, only to not make total sense afterwards. Subplots come and go for no reason as well. And where the film should be immensely interesting, comes nothing but boredom. I found myself frequently passing out during the film, and feeling that it was not even worth my time and energy to rewind to the parts that I missed (but did anyway). The film just comes off as a total mess, and seems like the filmmakers had no idea how to even begin to bring the novel to the screen. It reeks of heavy flaws and mistakes, and runs way too long for its own good.But what's worse is the acting. The big name cast proves to be a total and utter disappointment in every facet of the word. Zhang Ziyi comes off as an emotionless puppet, Michelle Yeoh comes off a failed attempt at acting, and Ken Wantanabe just does not look like he is even trying. These are all very good actors who have proved their worth in films before, and all prove to be useless here. They look like they just are there for a paycheck, and are spending their time on the set meandering through the screenplay and just reading off lines like they are nothing. While the supporting cast is not much better, Gong Li proves to be the only shining star in the entire picture as the scheming geisha Hatsumomo. She actually tries and is quite excellent in her performance, but she is ultimately brought down by the lack of emotion or real action shown by everyone around her.But where the acting and story fail, the overall design of the entire film succeeds. The art direction and costume design are absolutely awe-striking. The vivid colours and detail portrayed in the set pieces and in the character's costumes are just fabulous. Every visual in the film looks as if it has been finely crafted to look like they are straight out of the time period. The visual style of the film looks like a total work of art. While the actors may have totally goofed on their performances, what they wear and where they are in the film was not. The cinematography, while not up to the par set by Good Night, and Good Luck. is also noteworthy. These artists deserved their Oscars tenfold.While Chicago may have been a fluke (or just a really good investment for the Weinstein's), Marshall was clearly not right for this picture at all. This film may have had a very distinct visual style like Chicago, but it is definitely not the same film or even belongs in the same category as its predecessor. While the film may look great, having an American director making a film about olden style Japan was not the best of decisions. Yes, some scenes do involve Americans, but the majority involves Japanese. Having Chinese actors stand in for Japanese ones is tolerable in my eyes, but having an American director is not. Even Steven Spielberg, who was once attached to this film but now only serves as a producer, could not have pulled this off. Using an Asian director instead, would have made this film more authentic, and could have maybe even made the actors give a damn about their performances. I imagine they would also have a much better ideal of what Japan looked like at the time, as opposed to what Marshall helped create.With a much more polished script (along with a much stronger sense of direction, and not this boring result), and an Asian director, this film may have been able to be a real contender at this year's Academy Awards. Unfortunately, it will end up being remembered as an emotionlessly boring, yet visually gorgeous film. Had Chicago not proved as well as it did, Rob Marshall probably would not have spearheaded this film. But everyone but the production design team is to blame for this film's shortcomings. Its problems could have easily been corrected, but were not. And in the end, it fails to live up to the legacy of the book.Watch the film for its visuals, not for its story. If you do that, you will not come away disappointed. You may be sleepy though.6/10.",Memoirs of a Geisha

They are physically and mentally abused. You keep wanting the big revenge scene that does not come.The second is about the strategy and tactics of warfare between competing geishas. (some poetic justice here).The third is about the subtle difference between being a geisha and a prostitute.It is a Stephen Spielberg movie, with the expected larger than life feel. It has an overdone happy ending tacked on a rather grim movie.There are a few jarring things. One of the ""heroes"" accosted a little girl in a public park and bought her two snow cones, then secretly arranged to have her trained as a geisha. Some actors are replaced as they get older and some are not. Spielberg did not want to bother with makeup to make people age as expected. One character, ""the General"" seemed to age backwards. The little girls' parents seemed far too old. Perhaps they were supposed to be the grandparents. There were no subtitles or English for that part of the movie.",Memoirs of a Geisha
75,moviesleuth2,Brilliant except for one somewhat excusable way,8,24 March 2008,"Translating a book that is written in first person into a movie is undoubtedly quite challenging, especially if the narrator is a character that is clearly defined by what she says and how she tells the story (which is one of the reasons which, in my opinion, would make it impossible to put a book like ""Catcher in the Rye"" to film, as a lot of the book's essence would be lost in translation). That said, ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" does about as good of a job as can be expected. Definitely a mainstream film (one that was obviously intended from the very beginning to come out at Oscar time), but it's still very good.The acting is solid across the board, especially by Gong Li. The scenery is beautiful, matched with John William's brilliant score. Director Rob Marshall clearly knows what he's doing, and he has created a near-masterpiece. That's a term I use lightly because there's one part of this movie that is simply atrocious: the screenplay. It's awful. Some of the lines are so bad that if the rest of the movie weren't so good it would cause nearly everyone to be rolling in the aisles. That being said, I can't hold this against the film as much as I would a film with English-speaking actors. This is because very few of the actors speak English as a first language, and two (including Gong Li) had to learn it for the film, and most of them obviously had a hard time pronouncing some of the words. Still, I think some of the dialogue could have been rewritten that was just as easy to say as what was written in the script. It sounds as if it was poorly dubbed, except that the actors are actually saying these lines. What's worse, is that this dialogue hampers some terrific performances (with how much conviction can a person be expected to say something as painfully awful as ""It appears that we are rivals""?). Credit goes to the skill of the actors to not only make the bad dialogue sound as painless as possible, but to say it without bursting out in laughter. This is especially cruel for Gong Li. She's a wicked, spoiled woman who manages to give an Oscar-worthy performance, despite having most of the awful lines, such as the one above, and the immortal ""I shall destroy you."" There has been a mild amount of controversy over the PG-13 rating. This is rightly so, but only if you really think about it, as it's all done tastefully. Movies have been slapped with an R or even an NC-17 rating for some of the things that happen here. A girl is nearly raped, and a woman sticks her hand up another woman's dress to see if she has had sex with another man. It's only because of the relatively tasteful presentation of the material (and obviously the sway of a major studio) that this received a PG-13 rating. ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is a solid movie. It wasn't good enough for for best picture, but the performances are strong, especially by Zhang Ziyi (who isn't as good as her largely ignored performance in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" but that's because the script doesn't allow for as much depth) and Gong Li, who despite having some of the worst lines, is brilliant.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Another thing that I didn't quite expect was how much I enjoyed watching this movie from the very beginning to the very last minutes. It is one of the satisfying movie experiences I had in a very long time.The movie base on the book of the same name, and is actually base on the actual life of one of the most celebrated Geisha. The movie divided into main three parts of her life – 1 when she was young, 2 how she turns into Geisha, 3 the Geisha life during WWII.The movie is beautifully written and works out much better than I expected, there never was a dull moment, I keep me guessing what will happen next since I have no idea was Geisha was – everything I see is the new thing. The culture, style, music, and everything else and it left me grasping for me as the movie keep on playing.This is one of the very few Hollywood made movie of Japanese culture with all Asian cast speaking in English (other being The Last Samurai and Letters from Iwo Jima but it do consist of western actors too). The good part was despite speaking in English it still doesn't neither weird nor distracting. Thought it true some part can be hard to understand.Another thing that needs to talk about was the casting; I thought it was brilliant despite how much negativity it got for casting Chinese as Japanese. Ziyi Zhang is truly beautiful (I definitely fall for her in this movie), but it was Suzuka Ohgo performance as young Ziyi that was truly catch my attention. Li Gong and Ken Watanabe were also brilliant as usual.The movie was very well done and captures the sense of Japan during the WWII very well despite filming in California.

""Memoirs of a Geisha"" opens with child Chiyo being sold to a Geisha House by her poor fisherman parents. In her teenage years, she is renamed Sayori to fit her prestigious geisha training and is given the honour to be taught in the art of music, dancing, flirting and selling her innocence to the highest bidder. Most of the film sees Sayori spending her days walking around in a bubble of kimonos, make-up, saké and unrequited love.While I do not particularly care for long sentimental dramas in which the characters don't talk and only exchange meaningful glances, I have always enjoyed East-Asian portrayals since they are typically so interwoven with culture and grace. Memoirs of a Geisha is one such film - it is long, brooding, occasionally dull, but very graceful and delicate in its portrayal of a girl with the aforementioned qualities. That said, it is dangerously close to being a 2 and a half hour long tiresome costume party. It just about makes it.However gorgeous the oriental style is, Ziyi Zhang is incapable of projecting heart, spirit and inner-beauty as the young geisha. She often touches upon these things, but never seem to truly get there and never does she carry the film. It is instead Gong Li who stands out and surprises in a charismatic performance as Sayori's geisha rival. Sadly, most of the clever dialogue between these two is lost through everyone's ridiculously poor English. Michelle Yeoh is the only one with polished language skills in this aspect.Ultimately, this is a completely decent film but nothing that I would call one of the best of 2005. 6.5/10",Memoirs of a Geisha

82,asc85,A very pleasant surprise,9,27 December 2005,"I had my doubts about seeing this film for two reasons: 1. I had read the book and loved it.2. Most mainstream film critics didn't think much of it.But since I forced myself to finish the book so that I could see the movie, then I HAD to see the movie. I was very glad I did, and I don't know why mainstream critics mostly didn't care for it. While the movie wasn't as good as the book (what movies are?), it was remarkably faithful to the novel, which I very much appreciated. Again, not 100% so, but very little was changed, and of what they did change, I tended to agree with most of the choices they made.For those commenting on the ""stilted"" English dialogue, then you should complain about the book as well! This is how the book was written, so it is appropriate for the film to have a similar type of screenplay.As for the performances of the ""Big 3"" Chinese actresses, I thought Michelle Yeoh did the best job. Gong Li was perfectly cast as Hatsumomo, but I wish she had been in more of the film. And while I'm a big Zhang Ziyi fan, I was a little disappointed in her performance. It was quite understated, although this may have been the director's intent.One criticism though: the scene where the Chairman meets Chyo/Sayuri for the first time. In the book, the gap in years between that meeting and her learning how to be a Geisha with Mameha is not that great. But because there were only two actresses playing the role in the movie, they decided to have the young girl and not Zhang in that scene. Which is a little creepy to me in the movie version that the Chairman was apparently physically attracted to Sayuri at such a young age. I think they tried to address that by showing the Chairman seeing Sayuri years later (this time with Zhang in the role) when Pumpkin has her ""coming out party."" After that, then Sayuri links up with Mameha. But I don't know. It's still kind of creepy to me.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Still not overly sure what the job description of a geisha is, but it generally revolves around being a source of entertainment for men based upon dance, conversation and musical skill...and occasionally a bit more. Anyway the young girl Chiyo (Zizi Zhang, in her best role since ""Rush Hour 2"") struggles at first with what her future holds, until she meets ""The Chairman"" (Ken Watanabe, in his best work since ""Batman Begins""). Through this chance encounter she discovers maybe becoming a geisha will be a good thing as they mix in powerful social circles and can wield a lot of power. With a new determination, Chiyo works hard to excel in her geisha class. Soon she becomes the star pupil and before too long is the most sought after geisha in her town. What will it cost her? Where will she end up? These questions can only be answered by watching the movie, or reading a review with spoilers.It was alright, I'm sure many would love it, but I just found it a little slow.

84,HelenMary,a brilliant adaptation of Arthur Golden's magnificent book,8,30 December 2013,"The book is one of my favourites, so I was anxious about what the film was going to turn out like. I wasn't disappointed. The film had captured all the emotion, pain, hardship, sacrifice, toil and beauty of the book and transferred it to the screen with realism and honesty.It's a spectacle of a film; beautiful to look at and encapsulating the 'Geisha' story suitably for a Western audience and as a stand alone film is brilliantly entertaining, lavish and accomplished. If you have read the book, know anything about Geisha or Japanese culture, it may gloss over a little but is fine for the two hours limited window. It is exotic for those who are coming to this cold, and will confuse as a lot of the customs are not explained to the audience, although Chiyo's/Sayuri's training does teach a little. Arthur Golden, the author, was clearly well versed, well researched and had something of a passion for this subject matter.The costumes, beautifully depicted, are modernised slightly - Hatsumomo's costume and hair are especially radical and wanton to befit her character, and no detail was left un-examined; it is the attention to detail that I love in this film. Visually and emotionally, every aspect of the characters is well performed. The acting is superb, Michelle Yeoh was perfect as Mameha, elegant and experienced, and The Chairman (Ken Watanabe) fitted my imagination of him in his lovely kind ways. Both depictions of the main character (young and old) were superb. I think that the film overall was similar to how I pictured it helped, but I was a little disappointed to find that many of the characters were not played by Japanese actresses. Suriya for one, the lead, is Chinese, as is Hatsumomo. Michelle Yeoh is Malaysian. I can't fault the performances of these beautiful women but I'm just saying, why not Japanese ladies playing Japanese ladies? The film has flaws, of course, and I think that whilst the written word can give a balanced view of a lifestyle/profession/culture the film has inevitably glamorised it a little, but it does do very well in showing the beauty and the tragedy of this tale - based on a true story - and the film is emotive and captivating, full of both joy and sadness, laughter and tears.

Hatsumomo makes Chiyo ruin a valuable Kimono, forcing mother to make Chiyo a slave to pay her debt. At the age of fifteen, Chiyo is taken by Mameha, who wants to train Chiyo to become a Geisha. Mameha turns Chiyo into Sayuri, the most veered Geisha of all. Hatsumomo starts her fight to discredit and ruin Sayuri, to stop her from becoming a full Geisha. When she was a young girl, Sayuri has been infatuated with The General, though she could never be with him, which goes against what a Geisha is.Memoirs of a Geisha is an captivating story into a woman's life, who becomes the most popular Geisha of all. The colour of the Memoirs is so deep and lush, enhanced by Dion Beebe's cinematography. The landscapes and settings are so detailed and breathtaking, as well as the beautiful kimono's worn by all the Geishas. The score of Memoirs has such a haunting and mysterious ambiance, adding that layer of mystery, which is what a Geisha is.For all its highs and beauty, there is something awry with Memoirs of a Geisha. While this looks into the life of a Geisha, we don't get a real in-depth look. The wonderful visuals gloss over a lot of the story, as we don't see into the entire life of a Geisha, as they are meant to be these mysterious people, and the mystery behind them is lost here. The three leads; Zhang Ziyi, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh are Chinese actresses, while this is set in Japan. All three give wonderful performances in their roles, Zhang Ziyi brings such beauty and fragility to Suyari. Gong Li is captivating as the maniacal Hatsumomo. Mechelle Yeoh is so graceful as Mameha.Memoirs has been filtered through western eyes, and it does show. There is a real miss in authenticity. The English language seems so out of place; with Zhang Ziyi and Gong Li at times looking uncomfortable with English. We don't get a real look into the Japanese culture, which is so deep and rich, but Rob Marshal misses it. His direction at times to didactic, not letting the story come out naturally. Some of the dramatic parts verge on mellow dramatic, yet are evenly balanced by some absolutely engaging shots. Sayuri's dance in the snow covered stage is so spellbinding.With a mixed state of affairs, Memoirs of a Geisha is eastern culture for the main stream audience who dislike subtitles. This is a wonderful story of a woman's life, but it could have been raised to be a masterpiece if wasn't taken from a western perspective.",Memoirs of a Geisha

88,nicolechan916,Exquisite,9,2 July 2016,"A combination of many nations' talents, this exquisite film is both captivating and dazzling. Everything from the acting, directing, costumes, light, color, music, and cinematography is spot on, and leaves you with a reminiscent feeling. The first thing that captured my attention, as well as took my breath away, are Ohgo Suzuka's eyes. Maybe it is obviously color contacts (was it invented back then?) or some sort of color editing, but they really capture your attention. The striking color gives her a more innocent look, which could be what the filmmakers are counting on. Going on from that, I am especially impressed by Ohgo's and Zhang's performance. Ah, maybe that's why they wore color contacts, so it would be a direct link between the two actresses portraying the same person at different ages. Whatever the reason, they both gave electric performances and grasped their roles completely. While it is relatively easier for Ohgo to display innocence, Zhang does it equally well, that it is believable that they are the same person. My only regret is that I did not get to see more of Ohgo. The rest of the cast did superbly in their roles as well. Li Gong and Yeoh brought the fieriness and elegance to their characters, respectively. Li Gong does a good jealous, and flaunting woman, who's always bitter. Yeoh, who is Malaysian (#represent), does an amazing job at showing class, and this has got to be her most admirable work that I've seen. The tone of the film, which is set from the very first scene, makes for an intense drama. I was predicting a sort of dark, heartbreaking story because of the tone. Though that wasn't necessarily the case, it worked well throughout the movie. It helped to keep the intrigue there so that audiences would not drift off. This was only possible with the right directing, costume and set designs, editing and cinematography. The attention to detail in this is extraordinary. I especially loved the cinematography led by Dion Beebe, which complemented well with the tense mood of the film. In addition, I enjoyed the multiple voice-overs, in which we would see a character talking and then the scene would change so that it becomes a voice-over. Very carefully crafted and beautifully edited. Overall, a captivating historical drama, which also educates about an olden Japanese tradition (though I am unsure of the extent to which it is accurate). Having said that, the romantic line was a bit weird to me because of the age gap. I know age is just a number, but I don't really like the idea of older men liking younger women, just because it gives me the impression that they are 'dirty old men'. Though of course this does happen in real life, I'm just not sure of the ideology behind portraying it in a cultural film made from Western standards.",Memoirs of a Geisha
89,dcldan,"Good good, but there's something wrong.",7,25 December 2006,"Chiyo is a poor girl from a very poor family. She is sold to a ""okiya"", where she is going to be a servant and, maybe, a geisha. Due to an endless effort, going throw all the difficulties, she is able to become Sayuri, the most legendary geisha. Unfortunately, she is not able to reach the heart she would like. The movie is superb in the technical aspect: Costumes, photography, scenario. All is perfectly done in order to show you the pre-IIWorld War Japan. Actors are also very good, as they play very well their part. Directing that film was quite hard and, probably is the worst aspect of the film, the movie, about 2 hours and a half long, is sometimes a little slow. However, I must admit that explaining all the things to say in a reduced time is difficult; but the director makes a decent job. With a worse director, it could have been absolutely yawning. The wrong thing is the fact that, despite all the movie is well done, the result is not perfect. At any moment could I feel any empathy with the characters and the movie passes by with a feeling of emptiness that disappointed me. This is what cause the movie to not have a better mark; I should really recommend it, though, it is not perfect, but the movie is quite good.",Memoirs of a Geisha
90,JoshtheGiant,One of the Best of the Year,10,27 December 2005,"I went to see Memoirs of a Geisha with very low expectations because of the reviews and because of the story, in fact the only reason I went to see it is because my Grandmother wanted too and the other choice was Cheaper By the Dozen 2. After I left the theater I was just truly happy about my choice, Memoirs of a Geisha was not just a good movie but one of the best of the year. The film was just wonderfully shot, it was just beautiful. The shots caught the way Japan looks so well and the characters acted just as they really would in real life. The film was also very, very well directed. Rob Marshall made Chicago two years ago and he surpassed it with Memoirs of a Geisha by a mile. Marshall seems to know what each of the characters thinks perfectly and is a great director. The performances are even better, Ziyi Zhang is phenomenal in the lead and Michelle Yeoh and Li Gong are also amazing in their rolls. The story is also flawless, and is one of the best ever filmed. As is the screenplay with powerfully written characters and great dialogue. The one major flaw I can think of is the fact that the beginning is way to long. You have to wait a whole hour before you actually get to the main story. That could have been cut down a lot and made the film even better. In that case it might even have beaten King Kong and Millions and become the best of the year.",Memoirs of a Geisha

I expected a chick flick, woman power, sad depressing in most powers happy in some, but women will prevail. 2. I expected a full scale art house movie with a disturbing, confusing or dimly hopeful end. Needless to say if my sis and mom wouldn't have dragged me for this movie i would never have seen it.Well you know this movie was all that but even then i somehow managed to see it, and not get frustrated I'm still wondering why.The acting is top notch ( not that i expected anything less) , the background score achieves what it set out to do and is quite good, the costumes, sets etc are all good.But THE ONLY thing that got me through this movie was curiosity, i really wanted to know how this movie finishes and thats the only thing that kept me going.The only reason I'm giving this movie a 6 is because i know about Japanese culture but i don't understand it, and from what little i do understand about it, this movie is not really that bad (if I'm right).Would not recommend you see this movie in a good mood, but don't crib to much if some girl forces you to watch it.

92,kyrat,"Ambivalence. Beautiful (even if inaccurate/romanticized), but troubling...",8,10 April 2006,"I was surprised at the amount of negative reactions this film received. Before I write my review I should state: I do not know a lot about Japanese culture (outside of movies or their soap operas) so I can't speak to the authenticity of scenes/costumes, etc. I did wonder why they did not cast Japanese actors -- yet at the same time I decided to see it because Michelle Yeoh (one of my favorite actors of all time), Gong Li and Ziyi Zhang were in it. (They probably figured Americans don't know the difference and they should use the most famous Asians they could. I'm only surprised they didn't get Chow Yun Fat to play the Chairman.)It's been more than 5 years since I read the book, but I did remember being very ambivalent towards it. Even though it's supposedly based off a real woman's life, it seemed like a romanticized non-Japanese man's fantasy of what a geisha's life might be like. As someone else termed it, a Japanese Cinderella story. And even while the story gripped me as a love story, it also sickened me that this woman spent years aiming towards being a geisha for this man who decided to groom some little girl into (how I perceived it) his own mistress.I had the same ambivalence to the movie. It was gorgeous, lush, riveting. I thought all the actors in it were fantastic. I have heard their were inaccuracies, but my ignorance kept me enthralled. However I was still ambivalent about seeing this as a love story. Maybe I don't fully understand what a Geisha meant. (I thought it was a category between whore and wife- somewhat like a mistress - where they didn't sleep with the men, unless they had a ""protector""). I felt that if this was the 2nd best thing (after being a wife) women could aspire to in those days that it was kind of sad. They seemed like they were to function as pretty puppets who existed solely to please men. Therefore I was saddened when the movie ended with her becoming the Chairman's mistress. In the book they actually got married and had a child, which to me somehow signified that he really did love her - that he wanted to bring her up out of this position of servitude (I'm not saying that marriage can't be a submissive role too).So in the end I'm just going to say that I acknowledge the movie has some serious flaws, but it's just so enticing, so beautiful, that I feel it's worth seeing.",Memoirs of a Geisha

94,moutonbear25,What pretty wrapping,6,27 December 2005,"MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA Written by Robin Swicord and Doug Wright Directed by Rob MarshallDirector Rob Marshall has wrapped us a very special present with his follow-up to the Best Picture winning ""Chicago"", ""Memoirs of a Geisha"". He took all the time he needed to pick just the right box and a multiple-patterned wrapping in brilliant colours before meticulously covering the box and tying a flawless bow around it. It shines like nothing we've seen. It's a shame that upon opening this gift, we see that he forgot to put any thought into what to put in the box to begin with as tearing away this perfect packaging leads to an empty box.I have not read the highly successful novel this film is based on. And perhaps I am less in touch with my feminine side than I thought as I do not understand what all these Geishas are complaining about. Sure, the story begins with a young Japanese girl sold to another household and separated from her sister and only remaining family. She lives the life of a slave but is inevitably given the chance of any girls' lifetime, to become a Geisha (this is not ""Memoirs of a Housekeeper"" after all). A geisha, in case you're not entirely familiar, is a moving work of art, a Japanese hostess trained in the art of culture, dance and music. She is not a prostitute or at least this is what we are told. Understandably, I was puzzled when a bidding war begins over our heroine's virginity in order for her to pay off her debt to the household she grew up in and become a true Geisha. Ziyi Zhang plays Sayuri, the most sought after Geisha in all the land. She holds her own in what is her first English speaking role but ultimately does not say very much and pales in comparison to Michelle Yeoh, who plays her mentor and brings some much needed spunk, confidence and authority to this fragile, whiny weeper. Perhaps speaking English is the problem itself. Let alone that a large number of Chinese actresses play Japanese parts, this film would have been more effective if it was actually in Japanese. It makes no sense that these women would be speaking to each other in broken English all the time. The struggles to enunciate lead to emotions not being conveyed. The self-imposed communication barrier never allows the viewer to be taken in by this beautiful existence as the beauty comes across as contrived, designed for the North-American box office and not made for artistic purposes  Hope they're not too disappointed come Oscar time when the only nominations they get are technical ones.If you're into art, then ""Memoirs"" will narrowly carry you along throughout a rich, colorful journey. As for me, I will let Mr. Marshall keep his pretty box to re-use next time on the condition he promises to put something of substance inside it.",Memoirs of a Geisha

But then the extraordinary, beautiful Gong Li comes onto the screen and captivates the audience with the evilness of her character as we watch the young child turn into Sayuri, played by Ziyi Zhang, and you see at once the contrast of the standard, ""good"" vs.""evil"" Geisha. Ah, the scene is set, for the rest of the film to play outagainst these two women. But this could really be just a standard story, only clothed in Japanese, or is it Chinese?, silk costumes.Michelle Yeoh is wonderful in her role when she takes Sayuri under her wing and turns the ""ugly duckling"" into the swan we knew she would be. The costumes, sets and the beauty of Japan are hinted at throughout the film; but somehow, it doesn't capture the real essence of a Kyoto or Kamakura garden lit by moonlight and the real beauty of a Japanese Geisha.MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA had all the potentials of delivering a story that takes a young woman on an extraordinary journey, but in the end, it is the ""Hollywood version/Big Studio depiction"" that we see with Sayuri finally reunited with her Chairman. Such a pity...I would rather have seen her in the arms of Nobu San, a REAL SCARRED WARRIOR, and a man who deserved the love of a real Geisha.

96,Semisonic,An ugly story dressed prettily,5,9 July 2016,"Is something good just because it looks nice on the surface? Is something normal just because nobody protests against it? And should you give a damn and intervene if it doesn't affect you directly?The far-away foreign lands were unknown and full of mysteries once. I'm a part of the Western civilization, and the Oriental realm of Japan seems like a terra incognita to me even in the XXI century, let alone what it was almost a hundred years ago. And Memoirs of a Geisha is a story shedding light on the secret world of the pre-war Japan. A story of a young fisherman's daughter sold to a geisha house.The intricate cultural details are deep and captivating. The old buildings and pavements catch your attention, the old costumes make you wonder about what could be a reason behind inventing something so complex. All these enigmas wrapped in mysteries leave you a breathless observer on this mesmerizing spectacle called a life of a geisha. And it's very tempting to resort to admiring this unparalleled complexity and to think that a culture so diverse and rich simply couldn't beget anything bad or wrong. Especially when we're constantly reminded of how important it is to follow the ancient traditions. The wise ancestors can't be wrong, can they?This overly romanticized story tries its best to present Chiyo, a common girl turned the most exquisite geisha in Miyako, as some sort of Japanese Cinderella. And so that we don't get lost in translation but still get a taste of the foreign flavor, the actors use an awkward mix of English and Japanese. All to make us believe that what we saw was basically a fairy tale, or a success story at least. That is, that Sayuri is the best thing that could have happened to Chiyo.But why can't I shake off the sense of utter ugliness about this whole film, as if someone decided to dress corpses in fancy clothes and play house with them? Maybe because, despite the excess of sweet delicacy, Memoirs of a Geisha is still a story of a person whose life is broken from the very start, who's forced to cast away everything she ever was or hoped to become, and turn into a slave of the cruel system where men are everything and women are nothing more than painted dolls for their entertainment.It's hard to blame the film for it, for it's not the writer's or director's fault that the Japanese society was so bitterly harsh and cruel towards women. And it's certainly no surprise, since a nation that puts a code of honor, distorted and predisposed towards torture and death, above lives of its own people, can hardly be an example of humanity.But one can feel an almost visceral disgust over the fact that the film openly worships the visual aesthetics of the geisha phenomenon, turning a human life into a show we all are offered to watch if we pay a certain cost. But to blunt our own conscience and make this human circus watchable, we're given a bunch of narrations telling us how a girl should be happy about being a geisha, and how she is happy about the idea of becoming a mistress of a man who simply gave her a sweet treat when she was a child. That less cruelty and exploitation is already a virtue because it could've been so much worse...The world of today has lost the boundaries of the past, and the cultures once confined within the nations bearing them are now for everyone to observe. Some things we eagerly assimilate, some things are just too strange and uncommon to accept, yet are intriguing enough to spectate at. And maybe it's indeed none of my business to judge, but my sense of good and evil refuses to enjoy that cult of human sacrifices, no matter how much silk and paint is used to make it pretty. So maybe it's a good thing that Japan lost that war 70 years ago. And not just so the Western women don't have to please men like geishas, but also because a pretty unfreedom is still unfreedom, even if everyone calls it happiness.",Memoirs of a Geisha

102,samseescinema,"a portrait that's richly beautiful, but sadly without any emotional weight",7,24 December 2005,"Memoirs of a Geisha reviewed by Sam Osborn www.samseescinema.comrating: 2.5 out of 4 For those, such as myself, who've never perused Arthur Golden's super-selling novel, Memoirs of a Geisha, Rob Marshall's film will be a mostly enjoyable engagement. For the rest of you, however, I can't imagine the film dissecting the depths and meticulous details the novel probably offers. The film goes only skin-deep, not delving and scraping against the deeper, hard-to-reach, emotions of its audience. We're intrigued by its lavish imaginings of 1940's Japan, and by a lifestyle inadvertently foreign to all but a few westerners; but when Marshall's characters and romance is put to the test, in the crucial moment of heartbreak and tragedy, Memoirs of a Geisha leaves us unaffected.The film follows the solemn dynamics of the traditional Geisha lifestyle in the years during and before Japan became involved with World War II. We begin on the shores of a rural fishing village in 1929, where nine-year-old Chiyo (Suzuka Ohgo) and her sister are being sold by their parents to households in Kyoto. Bought by Mother (Kaori Momoi), the owner of a geisha house, Chiyo is initially raised in the hopes of becoming a geisha, but because of her many infractions and conflicts with the house's top earner, the sly, vindictive Hatsumomo (Li Gong), Chiyo is promptly demoted to Mother's slave.Passing between chores on a village bridge one day, Chiyo is approached by the Electricity Factory's Chairman (Ken Watanabe), flanked with two elegantly garbed geishas. The Chairman greets her with kind words and buys her a snowcone, introducing her, for the first time, to human kindness and honest generosity. She vows after the encounter, that in the days and years that follow, her every move will be dedicated to training and becoming a geisha to move herself closer and closer to that iconic Chairman. Later, Mameha (Michelle Yeoh), the leader of another geisha house, purchases Chiyo from Mother and launches her proper training in the geisha arts.Most striking about Rob Marshall's Memoirs is his opulent re-creation of Kyoto, Japan. Often, during the Awards Season, we're desensitized to visual splendor, expecting only the best and all but ignoring creative cinematography. But with Memoirs it's unmistakable. Marshall worked with the same Cinematographer, Dion Beebe, in his last film, Chicago. Beebe's been justifiably recognized for his work with Collateral and Michael Mann's upcoming film, Miami Vice. With Memoirs, Beebe employs a rich palette of colors that sometimes encounters a brilliance almost laughably good; the sort of visuals we'd like to put on ""pause"" and frame upon our walls. His camera moves gracefully between houses and streets and the entirety of Kyoto, continually in motion, giving the already sumptuous shots a slow, haunting elegance.Beebe's work and Marshall's direction give Memoirs the right tone of eloquence; a chord struck only to be silenced by the film's clunky screenplay. There have been complaints that Robin Swicord and Doug Wright's script only brushes the surface of the novel's depths. Other critics have even gone so far as to re-title the film ""Outline of a Geisha"". Having never read the book I can't attest to these complaints. What's obviously amiss, however, is the film's inability to rely on visual storytelling. Instead of allowing Beebe and Marshall tell the more sentimental segments of the story through their images and the actors' forceful performances, Swicord and Wright's script bogs the film down with a clumsy, overloaded narration. It's written plainly, in words of melodramatic flair and annoyingly obvious symbolism, undermining the eloquence and force of the film's quieter moments. The story could easily have been translated without the narration. Its inclusion is an undercut to Marshall's skill as a director and Beebe's near-perfect cinematography.Also bizarrely poor is the script's approach towards dialogue. The lines, to be frank, we're written for actors confident and accustomed to the English language. Sounded through heavy accents and miffed pronunciation, the words come off forced and read. That's not to say the flaw lies in the acting, however. The performances are proved through the actors' expressions, which exude honest inhabitance of their roles. Ziyi Zhang in particular deserves the nominations she's sure to receive. But, again, the script undercuts the film's power, this time distracting us with dialogue insensitive to the limitations of the actors' linguistic abilities.With different screenwriters at the film's helm, Memoirs of a Geisha would be a staggering success. As it is, we're left with a film that succeeds in its portrayal of a geisha's lifestyle, but also fails at its romantic core. Sparks between the Chairman and Chiyo (later called Sayuri) are rarely struck, maybe because the two spend very little on-screen time together. Watanabe does well with the role, but as his character is finally pulled into focus, the film starts getting long and ends without climax. Marshall's Memoirs is a portrait that's richly beautiful, but sadly without any emotional weight.-www.samseescinema.com",Memoirs of a Geisha
103,thomvic,Gorgeous but lacks the emotional punch of the novel,6,16 October 2010,"The novel was a story that really had you absorbed into this world of geisha in a time once a upon atime ago. So I was really excited to see this movie as soon as I could.Visually, the film is spectacular. The sets, costumes and cinematography are stunning. The story is essentially a Cinderella story of a young girl sold to a Geisha house, is treated viciously by the most successful Geisha there, and longs to be with the man she loves in order to find true happiness.OK, the main problem I had is that some of the English is a bit hard to understand. But the performances were excellent, though I have to admit I had to keep my ears listening a bit harder at times to ensure I got what they were saying - Gong Li needs a bit of work on her English but she played the scheming and treacherous Hatsumomo very well. It almost felt as though they had rehearsed their lines so much that it didn't feel natural sometimes. Ziyi Zhang was OK but she felt more like a fragile paper cut doll sometimes. Michelle Yeoh - I think they needed someone else to play Mameha mainly because her English was too good to feel authentic.Also, surprisingly, even though I knew what was going to happen since I read the novel, I felt they didn't transfer it to screen as well that really kept you engaged. I actually felt myself drifting off at times and I was thinking to myself why. I think because in the middle the movie essentially becomes a game of tug o war between Sayuri and Hatsumomo. Also, the third part of the movie loses its strength once the main villain departs, and it essentially becomes a love story again.I didn't have a problem with the main characters being Chinese actresses, but this movie is essentially a Hollywood style movie. You don't really see the pain and struggle the Geisha go through but what we see is more of the pain of not being able to love freely. But they could have explored more of the other aspects such as the pain of losing the family, the philosophies and thinking of their culture that the book explored so well.Also, another problem is that Sayuri's transformation into the geisha is done too quickly to really make you feel any of the pain she had to go through. This was done through a montage of scenes and it didn't work because it simply was trying to get it out of the way so it could proceed with the story. Didn't the realise that this was an important aspect of the film and it actually had a lot to do with the struggle they go through?The ending also was altered which I didn't mind but if only you really cared in the end. Because you're too busy looking at all the beautiful scenery to really care about the characters as much which is highly disappointing.The film tries very hard to move you but I didn't feel moved and it didn't sweep me off my feet like the novel did. I think because essentially this is more like a glimpse into this world and not really a full exposure into the philosophy and true pain they go through.",Memoirs of a Geisha
104,MovieZoo,Memoirs makes for a good memory,7,23 December 2005,"You can always see a movie about growing up and having to deal with disappointment, pain, hope and love. I have seen many like that. Memoirs of a Geisha tells the story well. The best part of this is the Japanese background and the exposure to their history.I found it endearing, enlightening and, at times, frustrating. The frustration mostly comes from some disorienting direction. It's hard to explain because the story is well told and scenes blend well together. However, some scenes felt too ""rushed"". Perhaps at 2 hours and 25 minutes that shouldn't be a bad thing. If they had spent more time on the artistic beauty of the geisha rather than the ugliness of hierarchy, I would have enjoyed it even better.Fine acting for the most part, but I think Ken Watanabe was miscast. He performed well, his name served as a good draw, but his character was not one of mystique and power - more of compassion and all-around good guy. Suzuka Ohgo and Ziyi Zhang on the other hand performed equally as well in portraying a more dynamic personality, the main character. Both were very convincing and charming. Both were good at tugging at the heart strings.The movie easily deserves a 7/10.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Sisters sold to help a dying mother, one for one part of town and the other prized for her unusual eyes.

Her mentor is also from ""...Tiger..."" as the unrequited heroine.She learns to melt hearts along the way, but not seeming to reach the one heart she truly yearned for - or did she?

Photography is not something I readily note in movies, but it stood out here, and anyone could not help looking at the scenery. Majestic is a better adjective. I thought all the actors were splendid, especially the lead actress, but those blue contact lenses were so, so obvious---please. Also, I must add that the speech, the way English was spoken in this film differed from one actress to another. It went from unintelligible to clear as day without a trace of an accent. I also found the story a bit confusing and hard to understand at points, but eventually I got it. I feel this movie is a lovely glimpse into another era. A period piece and a romantic love story as well. It is also a drama too. I recommend it and I enjoyed it. It has flaws, and they are apparent, but it is a lovely film.",Memoirs of a Geisha

108,walsh-22,Never heard of Geishas till this film,9,23 May 2007,"To be honest when this film first came out, I wasn't really interested in seeing it but my friend talked me into it and I'm glad she did because I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.I have never heard of Geishas before and the way it was explained to me sounded like a courtesan but this couldn't be further from the truth and the film helped to explain who Geishas really are. They entertain men through dancing, playing musical instruments among other talents like Mameha says Geishas sell skills not bodies. It reminded me of regency dramas where young woman in the day had to make successful matches and to do this they needed to be very accomplished, they had to read, dance, converse, sing and play musical instruments. Being a Geisha, you had to give up on love and not want the normal things ordinary woman wanted such as marriage and children. They're comfort wasn't important, they are moving works of art that wealthy/ influential men admire. The preparation they had to go through is very extensive and a lot more than I realised.Each frame of film is like a huge painting with beautiful scenes that take your breath away.The film evokes so many emotions mainly happiness and Sadness. Happiness when she is taken under the wing of Mameha who shows her the ways of the Geisha and her dream has finally come true and especially at the end of the film when The Chairman becomes her patron. You feel Sadness at one point when she does something shameful and The Chairman witnesses it and leaves and all her hopes and dreams go with him. The scene where she throws his hankie away had me in tears because it is heartbreaking for her when she gives up and throws away her only link to him. It is also sad seeing Pumpkin as an adult because she was such a sweet girl who looked out for Chiyo but because she didn't become a Geisha, she turned against Chiyo/Sayuri and became very hard faced and out for what she could get.Special mention should be made to actors such as Ziyi Zhang (Chiyo/Sayuri), Suzuka Ohgo (Young Chiyo), Ken Watanabe (The Chairman) and Michelle Yeoh (Mameha). Also Rob Marshall who directed the film, John Williams who did the music, Cinematography by Dion Beebe, Film Editing by Pietro Scalia and Robin Swicord for his screenplay. They helped to make the film a joy to watch.",Memoirs of a Geisha
109,SimonD1900,Nicely written story and a beautiful film,7,19 December 2019,"I can be forebearing that the movie takes place in Japan but they talk English with different kind of other Asian dialects. A detail that is not more importent then the story it self. But it would been amazing if they used Japanese actors/actresses. But all actor/actresses do a great performances, so that is also a bit forgiving. And it still looks right! Very beautiful movie in all aspects, it looks authentic and real from sets to dresses, I'm no expert have to admit, but looks good to me. Just beautiful.Now, the story is very good. About a womens fate in a sertein time and place in the world, when being a women meant many limitations and rules to be forced to live by, ecpecially if you were a poor one. And how a talanted spirited women could do the best of it, with some luck. A sad and melodramatic story but still beliveable and real in its own way.To think about what women of that time must have had gone trough, maybe this movie even is mild and more romantically spoken then the truth. Probably.The score is also very nice.Have to say that her big romantic intresse was a bit creepy, how old was the chairman actually? But still, probably not unbelievable that she would fall in love with an older man like that, that gave her a helping hand of comfort and kindness when her life was nothing but complete hopelessness, loneliness and misery.A poetic beautiful movie. Just had been soo much better to see it with Japanese actresses/actors. Even if this cast is the Asian international elite of movie performers. That is the only thing for me that brings it down a bit.",Memoirs of a Geisha
110,fastmike,Beauty and the East,10,2 April 2006,"True to Arthur Golden's novel, 'Memoirs' will fascinate you like as if you were examining the facets of an exquisitely cut diamond.Brilliant performances by Suzuka Ohgo as young Chiyo, (adorable), Ziyi Zhang as Geisha Sayuri, who seemed to put her whole heart and soul into the part, the two 'alter-egos' : Michelle Yeoh as Mameha and her bitter rival, Li Gong as Hatsumomo, 'the ageless' Ken Watanabe, and all the detail and all the research that went into this, gives us of a glimpse of the last years of the culture of Imperial Japan.This 'legend' of a love story weaves together a kimono of fine silk threads of innocence destroyed, suffering, revenge, friendship, love, betrayal, rebirth, courage, dignity and honor and creates a print of beauty and tragedy.It cannot, and should not be seen just once. Dion Beebee's Cinematography was simply beautiful and stunning, and 'clearly', it takes into account the availability and use of the most current technology.And who could not have guessed that Steven Spielberg's understanding of Japanese culture, first exemplified in ""Empire of the Sun"" did have 'a hand' in this Spielberg/Lucy Fisher production. It is an unfortunate coincidence, almost as in the tragic tradition of the far east, that this did not win an award for best picture, as 'Empire' should have won in 1988. I'm not a critic, by any means; just an ordinary viewer. But I simply cannot fathom by what means that the Motion Picture Academy uses to judge 'Best Picture'.This goes beyond entertainment, and into the realm of cinema art, a just wonderful and enchanting tale. See it and judge for yourself.{On a large screen LCD with an upconverting DVD, it was all the more stunning}",Memoirs of a Geisha
111,HanShotFirstGR,A not-so-good change of style.. Overall pretty good!,7,14 May 2021,"Plot:Nitta Sayuri reveals how she transcended her fishing-village roots and became one of Japan's most celebrated geisha.Analysis:A movie that everyone probably have heard but very few have actually seen it. I have been waiting a long time to watch this and despite some issues I have, I can say this is a positive and memorable experience for everyone. It's a book adaptation that dives deep into a certain Japanese era to inform the viewer about a culture he probably knows nothing about. It works almost as a docunentary to a hard reality of those days.The artistic view on the visual representation of the story is undeniable. Every frame is a work of art, like it has been painted by an artist. The beautiful landscapes and the well-made sets help the atmosphere of the movie to be even more heartwarming. Rob Marshall used pretty wide shots and took advantage of the great cinematography to craft a visual masterpiece that gets you hooked immediately, a massive achievement that works in favor of this project.All of this prepared me for a huge success and to be fair the first act is quite amazing, but as the movie progresses, the story loses its spark leading to an ending that although it's sweet, it doesn't leave you the warm feeling you wanted to. It starts with a very cozy and loveable journey through hardships and pain with a little girl trying to gather her pieces, a depressing but really interesting idea. After that, there is a huge change of style to a success story that has its moments but overall it's somewhat boring and very slow. Many information about the society in early 1900s Japan were included, but they could be presented in a more appealing way. It's a story that gives you enough to be satisfied, but not enough to be excited.If one thing helps the result to be more positive is the brilliant cast they chose. The (very familliar to Western fans) Ken Watanabe in a secondary but very important role, the gorgeous Ziyi Zhang (who amazed us in House of Flying Daggers), Gong Li, Michelle Yeoh and the little Suzuka Ohgo who despite her young age was brilliant and extremely professional. A cast like that elevates a movie, talent, hard work and passion are things that those actors have proved many times that they have and this was another very well-acted movie for their resume. This is the thing that makes this film worth-watching, how all of them make you feel like you witnessed something real, not a forced drama, but a bittersweet reality.If I had one major complain is that this movie is in English. A nitpick for sure but it just doesn't make sense to hire Asian actors and make them talk in English just to be more financially successful in US. It's true that many people don't watch movies with subtitles but that doesn't mean creators have to change film's identity to match those demands. Those who are truly interested in watching this won't mind using subtitles, so the language should be Japanese without a doubt.Conclusion:Memoirs of a Geisha is a safe choice. You can always enjoy the amazing visuals when the story isn't interesting enough and you will still be very satisfied. A slow movie that works perfectly for the first half and despite a less entertaining second one, it does remain quite good. Be prepared for a journey through early 20th century Japan, not the classic Asian drama.Rating: 7.5/10.",Memoirs of a Geisha

I thought the authenticity of the depiction of pre-War Japanese life was steamrollered by the Hollywood machine. I had far less problems with the casting than some here, but there were two stand-out awful moments that let the movie down badly.The first was the embarrassing MTV style ""dance"" that Sayuri did for her ""coming out"" party. Just wrong, wrong, wrong. No geisha can look elegant sprawled full-length on the stage. And secondly, Sayuri kissing the Chairman at the end of the film ... How much more effective (and authentic) this scene would have been had there been no physical contact between the two. It should have been left that the Chairman would continue to protect Sayuri, but there would never be anything more between them. Now, *that* would be romantic ...",Memoirs of a Geisha

Never did I think beautiful scenery or beautiful costumes , I only thought is Japan really so kitschy?

The soundtrack is an oriental delicacy, Ziyi Zhang was perfect for me in this role, the rest of the cast as well. The cinematography was worth watching in a theater, what a pity I was only a kid when it first made its way on the big screen.Perhaps it was a bit too ''americanized'' sometimes, it centered on some modern western ideas that I appreciate and follow, like ''the past is in the past'' , ''lack of self-confidence vs high self-confidence'' but I really consider that they didn't fit well in the portrait of the Japanese society of the 30's and 40's. And I was a bit shocked by the difference between Nobu-san in the book vs. Nobu-san in the movie. Robin Swicord did a nasty thing in there changing Nobu fundamentally.But otherwise, as I said, worth-watching, a good theatrical experience and a good movie.An 8 out of 10 from me.",Memoirs of a Geisha
117,parhat,Gaudy American Version of Japanese Geisha Cinderella Story,5,27 June 2006,"I lived in Japan for sometime now and have also stayed briefly in Hong Kong also. As a result I wish to comment on this movie, that I feel may have give some weight, or lack of it.There are three kinds of people who enjoyed the movie, those who want to be just entertained and nothing else, those who want to learn about what it is like to be Geisha, and those who want both.Clearly this movie is designed to be only entertained and nothing else. It is an empty feeling you know when you leave the theaters, and say to yourself, ""I have just ate fast food, but without any nutritional value."" Sorry to say, it is an eye candy movie. It is also the work of pure fiction, the casting is clearly Chinese, the music the Geisha dance to is Chinese, the lack of use of incense, importance to Japanese Geisha rituals, is lacking. The rooms where the Geisha live is clearly Chinese (they had large rooms), and the director of the movie is clearly an American, which tends to make the Geishas, clearly gaudy and shallow. Have you ever SEEN a classic Japanese movie - anyone? In fact this is a movie about an American pop culture would like to view Geisha, a fact that will not surprise viewers in discoveries of hidden mystique of Japanese culture, and shall always be hidden because American Values has been imposed upon. This is serious, we will never get to learn what it is like to be a Geisha. To conclude anything of this movie is the feeling of emptiness that it is nothing more than a Showy and Gaudy American Version of Japanese Geisha Cinderella Story. This is what a Japanese would view your Geisha movie. In fact from the point of view of a Japanese, the Geisha dance was laughably clumsy amateur. I mean with all those years of practice, we would expect some finesse? I have to be honest with you, I'd rather watch a BBC documentary of Japanese Geishas before pre-World War II, then to sit through this with lies and deep American fantasies of Geishas then to be entertained to death, only to find that there is nothing true and you not only feel that things you learned can never be used, because everything about this movie is Chinese: actors, actresses, sets, music, culture, house, clothes, etc. If you have any knowledge of how Japanese pronounce words, how they dance, what music they play, it would be fun to watch the movie, even if it is fiction, because deep in your heart the people who made the movie are clearly telling you something, with such authenticity, that a fiction, not matter, it is something that we can talk about what Geisha really is.To be a fair person, like David and Goliath, this is clearly a movie made by an American Goliath, with absolutely no take on David. I therefore would call this movie an American Geisha story of a Japanese Cinderella. If the movie is going to be a classic, you must consider that the movie must be both entertaining and have the feelings of authenticity.",Memoirs of a Geisha
118,cwrdlylyn,MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA : Deserves More Credit Than Critics Offered...,8,11 March 2006,"MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA One of 2006's biggest disappointment's critically also turned out to be one of the most under-appreciated gems of the past year for this viewer. GEISHA was hyped as the major awards contender all year, but was released to disappointed reviews and little praise outside of it's technical merits. However, for me the film isn't nearly as flawed as people made it out to be.MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA tells the story of Sayuri, a young Japanese girl who is separated from her home, family, and everything she holds dear to her and is sent to live in a Geisha house. Though her potential as a Geisha is recognized immediately, a rival Geisha named Hatsumomo (played by Gong Li) sets out to destroy young Sayuri before she even starts.However, as the years go by, fate offers the young Sayuri many mixed blessings. She meets the Chairman (Ken Watanabe) and he is the first person she has ever met to offer her unrestrained kindness... and from this day on she makes it her goal in life to one day be with him. As the years go by, Sayuri (played as an adult by Ziyi Zhang) becomes Japan's greatest Geisha. However, her rivalry with Hatsumomo and her struggles to gather the affections of the Chairman are made virtually impossible by the slave like world of a Geisha.MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA is perhaps 2005's most beautiful film, and it was rightfully recognized for these qualities throughout the awards season. The visuals seem to beautiful to be real, however a balance is constantly offered through a realistic, dirty view of the other side of life as a Geisha. However, it seems unfair to me that the other elements of this film found such little respect from critics.Personally, I have not read the book, so perhaps many justified criticisms were lost on me... but to me the film was very good and exciting to view. The direction of Rob Marshall keeps things moving at a thrilling pace throughout Sayuri's youth, her training as a Geisha, and her rivalry with Hatsumomo. These sequences are captured brilliantly, and the film never loses it's thrilling pace throughout. The film only begins to lag and lose it's magic when the film's entire focus shifts to the American invasion and the finale of Sayuri's pursuit of the Chairman.The film also features many wonderful performances from a great ensemble. Ziyi Zhang is compelling in the central role of Sayuri, and her beauty is undeniable. Before seeing the performance, I gave her a lot of flack and couldn't understand why she was getting so many Best Actress notices this season. Having seen the performance, I still question whether Zhang was truly deserving of getting SAG and Globe nods over the likes of Joan Allen and Naomi Watts (personally I would have chosen either of them first), however... I can see where some people would have admired Zhang's performance enough to nominate her (thankfully she did not get the Oscar nod which would have been pushing it).However, I am surprised Zhang received all the acting notices for this film. When she was on screen opposite Gong Li as Hatsumomo she came close to being lost in the shuffle. Li's pure evil permeates the screen and is beautifully captured in the film. Though her role is rather one-dimensional... she plays that one-dimension to perfection and invigorates the screen with an incredible energy. Also offering a great performance is Michelle Yeoh as Sayuri's trainer and fellow Geisha Mameha. It's a very subtle, restrained performance... but her motherly guidance is perfectly mixed with the feminine allure of a Geisha. Yeoh and Li are a perfect oil and vinegar match up, with one offering a cool/soothing presence to balance out the other's fire-like/evil presence.Overall, GEISHA's impact wanes a bit in the end as it drags to it's romantic conclusion. But the ending can't take away the beauty and power of the films first three quarters. MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA was one of the year's better films in my opinion, and hopefully anyone who avoided it b/c of the critical drubbing it took might give the film a chance after reading this and see that it deserved more acclaim then it received....

119,Michael-70,Nothing I Write Will Make This Film Any Worse Than It Is Already!,1,22 December 2005,"This film is incomprehensibly dull.There is not a single character I was interested in nor a situation I found worth paying attention to. Maybe there is just too much of a cultural difference between me and the story. Perhaps a story about a girl trying to be on the football cheer-leading squad may not be of interest to a Japanese man, but in this case, I just was not enthralled.Also, why is there controversy about the use of Chinese actresses playing Japanese characters when they all speak English like the Vietnamese hooker in Full Metal Jacket? ""Sererousry, in movie, dey all speaky engrish rike dis. Sorry Charry, me no like geisha girl who not pretty. Me pretty, me love you long time. Me sucky sucky, five dollar now!"" Even Michelle Yeoh talks like that and I know she can speak English very well. That is the real cultural insult. Yes the film has beautiful photography, costumes and sets, but after fifteen minutes, there better be a story or a character you care about or all of that other stuff is wasted no matter how well it's done.It is hard for me to understand how this picture got made. Was there anyone working on it who was so consumed by bringing this story to the screen that they would have sacrificed anything to see it done? Some great films get made that way. Some great films also get made by ordinary filmmakers working to the best of their talents with good material, but this film feels so false and untruthful, I could not see any passion in it.

But the problem is both of these roles are fundamentally flawed because the same culture brought us the horror of WW2.This movie does try to expose some of the horror of the Geisha. But it doesn't draw a line under it. Failing to show the corrupt culture of Japan at the time.There is people who still idolise Geisha, you can find them in these reviews.

Given that Les Miserables and Great Gatsby were amazing adaptions of the book I was expecting something similar from this one but was I wrong. The main problem with this adoption is that it lacks the emotion with which Geisha tells the story. She hates it, finds this whole world bizarre but in the movie we do not see it. It is shown as something she finds normal and adapts to it. There is emotion of dislike towards geishas expressed. Maybe the creators were being careful not to insult the culture but without that emotion and Chiyos attitude towards Geishas, the movie looses that what made the book so great. Real-life link: if you are not a modern undefended woman, you fate depends on others and sadly mainly rich man. Plausibility: A 14 year old falls for an older men because the men shows him kindness but why would an old men like the Chairmen fall for a kid so that he sends Mameha to help her become a geisha without being a pedo? There is something shady here that does not fit. But that has more to do with the book then the movie. Storytelling: Follows the book nicely, with the exception that it leaves out the reason why the father sells the girls and that it ends quickly without telling that the chairmen and Chiyo get together and have kids and she moves the states. Casting/ Acting: I liked the fact that the actors were not Westerns but what bugged me a bit was their accent, why would you not cast American actors with the same background to get rid of the accent?

I mean if you tried to have a movie like this, and use Madonna has the lead role, that would ruin the film, but this is just my opinion.Here is a quick summary of what this movie is all about. There is a little girl Chiyo who gets sold to a Geisha house by her poor family. While she is at the Geisha house, she becomes a servant, then when she gets older starts to learn the ways of the Geisha, in order to become one herself someday.The script is very well written and all of the actor preform their parts well.This movie is not for everyone, but if you get a chance, please watch it, you won't be disappointed.",Memoirs of a Geisha

(If nothing else what of the cello solos by Yo Yo Ma and the violin solos by Itszak Perlman?) Some of the scenes were incredibly beautiful (the cherry blossoms and the scene on the bridge) All of the performances were flawless. I can not speak to the controversy about Chinese v. Japanese actors. I would not know the difference anymore than the average Japanese (or Chinese) person could differentiate between the different accents of English speaking Americans, nor do I think this would matter to most viewers of this movie. In fact may I suggest that such criticism is rather narrow and elitist. My husband and I had listened to this as a book on tape and to the best of my recollection the movie was faithful as far as it went with the story.

Maybe I can also have the ability to do something else. Life is not easy, on the road of life, no one can really help you. We can only rely on ourselves to grope and walk to see how we can live better.",Memoirs of a Geisha
125,crazyrabbits,And I spent my evening watching this?,4,1 January 2006,"After watching the film ""Memoirs Of A Geisha"", I got the feeling that if someone made a soap opera out of this film, it would be a smash hit. There's only so much melodrama a person can take, and ""Geisha"" delivers it in spades. I can only take so many longing looks and thoughtful stares before it starts getting repetitive, making the film just drag on for quite a while. The first half of the film plays out like a cross between Oliver Twist and Annie. It's like the filmmakers just threw every ""hard luck"" cliché they could think of into the first half, with Hatsumono developing a hatred for Chiyo and all the ""mistaken identity"" incidents Chiyo ends up getting sucked into, not to mention the fact that Chiyo's romance with the Chairman is so obviously choreographed from the beginning that you KNOW Chiyo ends up with the guy at the end of the film (this is especially creepy since he first met Chiyo when she was 9 years old!). Of course, the film also sets up Hatsumono purely as a foil and as a device to move the story along and give Chiyo motivation to become something more, which really gets on my nerves, since this same thing happens in so many other films. I also think it's strange that I was laughing at the film in certain parts when it was supposed to be a serious film (the whole ""when your mother was sick, we threw a fish into the lake"" bit was unintentionally hilarious.) Aside from the fact that all the characters in the film speak in English, the three lead actresses (GOng Li, Zhang Ziyi, and Michelle Yeoh) give good performances, which are only slightly stilted by the strange way they pronounce all their dialogue. This brings me to another point: if you're going to have a film about the lives of Japanese geishas, and the film stars people are supposed to be Japanese, then make the film an ALL-Japanese SPEAKING film. I don't have a problem with reading subtitles, so I think having everyone speak in Japanese would really help give the film a bit more credibility. Seriously, you don't have to pander to the masses to make a solid film. The last half of the film becomes the geisha version of ""Rocky"" as Chiyo (now called ""Sayuri"") duels with Hatsumono to...sell her virginity off to the highest bidder? And geishas are supposed to be courtesans? This film basically glorifies the whole concept of a geisha as someone who's a prostitute, regardless of what Mameha says. Of course, by the time World War II starts and Sayuri is sent away, only to come back to the total commercialization of the geishas themselves (made evident when Sayuri finds her childhood friend Pumpkin working as a prostitute), it finally becomes clear just how much of the culture the creators of the film sold out.Bottom Line: Although I will give the film marks for the cinematography and Zhang Ziyi's performance, the film is just too slow and too melodramatic for me to recommend it. Avoid it.",Memoirs of a Geisha
126,Edu-16,"Stunning, epic and sensual - 7.1 is plumb wrong.",10,27 January 2011,"Moved to put something down after watching this glorious movie for the fifth time. A delightful epic tale of a young girl whose love for the 'Chairman' provides the drive to overcome much hardship and cruelty. It sounds gorgeous, it looks gorgeous, it positively oozes class and authenticity.I personally had no issue with the choice of actors (all superb btw) speaking English as a foreign language. Language is not what drives this beautiful movie but even so at no point did I think the heavy accents odd or inappropriate. But then again, if I was Japanese, or an ex-geisha I might think otherwise.No. What I do think odd is the relatively low score on IMDb. Its an approachable 'moving work of art' is this. One to see, and then see again.",Memoirs of a Geisha
127,darkmax,almost a hit,7,19 January 2006,"Wow! Where should I start? With the good points then.The movie has many beautifully created scenes of an old Japanese streets and buildings. Gong Li's acting is as usual, impeccable (though she is not one of my favorite stars). The entire story is quite faithfully transported from the pages to screen. I would consider the ending to be better for this movie than the conclusion in the novel.So what's bad? Well, being an Asian, I can say that it is probably wrong to cast so many Chinese in an entirely Japanese setting. It is wrong both typically and stereo-typically. It is easy for a Chinese to spot a Japanese or Korean in a crowd, just like the Saxons can easily pick out a Germanic or Italian person in a crowd. This is unfortunately a stereo-typical misconceptions that American movie makers have. Most notable are forced accents of the Chinese actress. most unfortunate.I would have greatly enjoyed this movie if the cast were Japanese. And as for Rob Marshall's comment on Japanese actors not being able to act realistically, when you have not seen them all yet. There are reasons why so many Japanese dramas and movies were so popular through East and Southeast Asia in the 90s, good acting was one of them.The movie is suitably paced and is interesting enough to watch.",Memoirs of a Geisha
128,majic-5,An Asian Cinderella tale,4,20 December 2005,"""To discover kindness in a world where there is so much unkindness; to have one's prayers answered for security in an insecure world  is this not happiness?""  Memoirs of a Geisha, paraphrase of closing narrationWith these last lines, I think that the filmmakers hope not that the audience will answer ""yes"" or ""no,"" but that they will agree that this question was the proper focus for the movie, and that the characters explored the question with skill and feeling. Considering what the movie could have explored instead and still answered the question, the film falls short.It's clear that given the likelihood that two soon-to-be orphaned girls on their own would have perished in pre-war Japan, selling them to a geisha training house might be considered a prudent course of action for a dying parent. But for 9-yr-old Chiyo, being ripped from her family in the middle of the night and made an indentured servant must have been terrifying, and Suzuka Ohgo's performance captures the little's girl's internal chaos quite well. Adding to her plight is the treatment by the star geisha of the house, Hatsumomo, who sees in Chiyo a potential rival who could eventually detract from her own status. My heart went out to Chiyo as she struggled to understand and survive in a world so alien and harsh compared to the country life she had.What her treatment did show, however, was that within limits, a geisha could take control of her fate, by beauty, skill, and  equally important  cunning. But at no time does Chiyo seem to grasp this last, vital skill. She seems to be a leaf blown on the winds of fate: her mentor's deliverance, her customers whims, WW II itself, and finally, the appearance of her patron (the Japanese equivalent of a ""sugar daddy""). Where her geisha house owner, her geisha mentor, her arch-nemesis geisha, and even her childhood companion displayed considerable moxie in taking charge of their lives, Sayuri (the renamed Chiyo) seems to have missed a vital part of the geisha curriculum: Assertiveness, Guile, and Street-Smarts 101. Had the film wanted to truly explore deliverance from the harshness of a geisha's life, it would have delved into the rigors and dehumanizing costs of that life. There was only the briefest glimpse of geisha training and apprenticeship. There was a romanticized glamour in being part of the sex trade. (I know that ""geisha"" translates to artist, but when one auctions off one's virginity, sex is part of the profession). Admittedly, the world of the geisha that the film shows is a visual treat, full of expensive kimonos, manicured gardens, and gorgeous cinematography. But the stiff performances, awkward dialogue, and contrived feeling of the final scene makes me think that the director's real vision was either an Asian ""Chicago"" (his prior film) or ""Cinderella,"" not a geisha's Japan.",Memoirs of a Geisha
129,jordache-wee,Poor Storyline,5,29 January 2014,Not really an excellent story. But in terms of the art direction captured on the screen is magnificent and beautiful. The colors just blend in well from beginning till end.A complicated life and childhood during the Showa era where human trafficking is just common. Selling children is a way to obtain what you need.Chiyo/Sayuri is depicted to have a sad childhood with no one to turn to. Besides it's not her choice when her parents decided to sell her and her sister.The forbidden love is just lacking. Though some are needless to be said but it's not shown.,Memoirs of a Geisha
130,zhivago97,"Colorful, gratuitous and inauthentic",1,15 July 2021,"On the plus side, this movie includes many colorful scenes and atmospheric camera work. And, the overall arc of this storyline is somewhat interesting.Although it's intended to be an autobiographical account from the protagonist's perspective, it ends up feeling more like the scriptwriter desperately writing anything to pander to a generic audience oblivious to details. This technique waters down the overall effect. Kind of like reciting a great poem speaking with a baby voice.On the down side, the acting is heavy handed, the moments that are intended to be heartfelt end up being gratuitous and cheap even corny, and the technical details are poor.Why is the entire film made with ""Japanese"" characters speaking American English with Japanese accents??? Shouldn't they simply speak Japanese, their supposed native language, since this movie is based in Japan? Yes I realize this Jedi mind trick is normal movie making, and American language is indeed needed to appeal to a broader audience. The Japanese accents are one such example of a poor moviemaking choice. The movie makers severely compromised. And such details actually do take away from the authenticity of what could have been a much better movie.",Memoirs of a Geisha
131,Kryzak,"Beautiful film, but not super complex.",8,9 February 2006,"Warning: If you cannot get past the fact that this movie is shot through the eyes of an American (both director and author of the novel), involves mostly Chinese actresses speaking in *English* with a Chinese accent, and doesn't follow the true culture of Japanese Geishas, then you probably should not watch this movie.Otherwise, this movie was beautifully made and acted.I suspect that most of the bad reviews out there for Memoirs of a Geisha are probably because of the reasons I stated in the ""Warning"" section. And because I read those reviews, I went into this movie disregarding those aspects and came out fully enjoying it. I have to admit though, for the first 30 minutes or so, I was a bit jarred by the English-Japanese transitions. But after that, I was fine.Directing/Pacing: Most of the movie was very well directed, though there were some parts that were too long or didn't fit the flow of the story well. Near the end of the movie, I felt that the story dragged on a little too long. I understand what the author/director was trying to show, but the way they did it made the movie feel a bit ""lost"" in the last 20-30 minutes.Cinematography: Holy Moly! This movie was so beautiful it aches! I read that traditional kimonos aren't as flashy as the ones in this movie, but if you don't mind that the costume creator took some artistic liberties, you'll love the patterns and colors presented by all the kimonos in the movie! The one standout scene of the movie was the dance performance in the snow by Sayuri. It was done with so much passion and drama it just took my breath away! This is truly one of the most colorful movies I've seen in a while! Acting: Gong Li played the rival of Sayuri so well that we all hated her. She deserves an Oscar nomination for that performance. Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang were both good in their roles, but the standout has to be the little girl who played the young Sayuri. She was so convincing in her performance you can feel the tragedy of being taken away from her parents and the loneliness she felt. We want more of her in future movies! I've been on a good movie run lately, with 5 out of 5 movies scoring 8 or above! I love the Oscar season! =) So go check out Memoirs of a Geisha if you enjoy beautiful movies with a very drama filled story.",Memoirs of a Geisha
132,david-569,Above Avergae,6,15 May 2006,"The film clocked along like a firmly set metronome. Hardly ever wavering from the tick tick tick pace. Aesthetically beautiful, the director went through great pains to set the stage, and forgot about the actors. Many missed moments that had far greater import than the actors portrayed. Not their fault. The director's style is obviously on story and scenery. The actors were secondary. The WWII significance was all but lost as well. It had far less emotional import than it should have had.It seemed like the whole things was shot with one lens.Overall slightly above average. The story held it together.",Memoirs of a Geisha
133,JWJanneck,An American look at a piece of Japanese culture,8,24 February 2007,"Even though this movie seems to polarize the audience, it's interesting that most comments here, the positive as well as the negative ones, seem to agree on a number of important points about the movie: (1) It is beautifully photographed. (2) It is generally well acted. (3) It does not faithfully depict many aspects of Japanese culture and the world of Geisha. (4) It takes considerable license with the book it is made from.In addition to this, there is a lot of noise about Chinese acting in Japanese roles etc., which personally I find too boring and irrelevant to even go into, other than observing that characters of all nationalities get played by actors of all kinds of other nationalities, and in this day and age it's really time to get over it. So maybe they didn't get professional Geisha for the three leading acts, but then they also did not get Vietnam vets to act in Platoon, or actual porn stars to act in Boogie Nights---it is, after all, not a documentary, but a movie.That, by the way, seems to have been lost on many who criticize this movie for having an inaccurate American perspective on things. I am not knowledgeable about Japanese culture myself, but judging from the Hollywood depiction of cultures that I am familiar with I have no trouble believing that anyone expecting an accurate representation especially of the finer points of a foreign way of life, especially one so alien to American values and behaviors, will almost by necessity be disappointed. My background is European, which is a lot closer to American life than Japan in the 1920ies and 30ies, but nobody who is familiar with France, Germany, or Italy, will ever be fooled by the way they get depicted in American cinema---remember the ""Finnish"" hacker in Swordfish, who flashes two German passports and speaks perfect German all the time? Or the genre of movies telling the stories of repressed American teens let loose on the world in Europe? Anyone who watches these thinks that Germans run around in lederhosen, French carry baguettes 24/7, and Italians have Vespas welded to their rear ends. So the Geisha in this movie had their kimonos done the wrong way? Oh well...Obviously, the third and fourth points in the list above will only even occur to people who are familiar with the culture or the book, and I am not one of them. Those that are, and who think that they cannot get over the documentary-expectation I mentioned above, or the similarly still-born book-expectation that disappoints so many people watching a movie made from a cherished book, will probably be disappointed by the movie.The rest of us, however, get to enjoy the first two aspects of this film, i.e. a beautifully shot and competently acted movie, which in spite of its flaws ranks way above most other stuff that hits most cinemas these days. It has a great story to tell and it tells it with a relatively small amount of cheesiness, considering the subject matter, while still being moving and engaging. On top of that, it has lots of interesting characters, piles of beautiful women and a few handsome men, and gorgeous countrysides and sets. For me, that is more than enough to enjoy my time with a movie.",Memoirs of a Geisha
134,spooly_montana,"Male or Female, you will like this movie.",10,11 April 2006,"Some months back my girlfriend and I were going to see a movie in the cinema. We scanned the titles on the marquee. There was one movie she wanted to see, but after seeing the previews a few times prior, I had a strong feeling that I would not like it. It just happened to be the only movie starting anytime soon, so reluctantly I agreed to watch it. About 15 minutes into the film I look over to Basia and say how interesting the movie is. And after a half an hour I had to pinch myself to be reminded that this was not a dream, and I was fully enjoying MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA. From my auspicious entry up to our exit from the film, I was quite honestly blown away. The highly successful book by Arthur Golden translates into a richly textured and thoroughly engaging story on screen. You cannot help but enjoy it far beyond your wildest expectations. I can personally say that's true. Watching the film again on DVD only adds to my high regard for this movie. The magic transcends the screen, taking you away to a different time and place far from our own. In 1929, nine year old Chiyo (Newcomer Suzuka Ohgo) is taken from her home in a fishing village, and sold by her impoverished parents to a geisha house in Kyoto's Gion District. The film covers Chiyo's rise from a slave in the house, to her position later as Sayuri, the most renowned geisha in Japan. Add the onslaught of World War II, and the place in society for the geisha is changed forever. Ziyi Zhang (House of Flying Daggers, Hero) stars as the older Sayuri, along with Ken Watanabe (Batman Begins, The Last Samurai). I am sincere in saying that, if you enjoy a good story, with exquisite characters, and well done drama, you will enjoy this film. Whether you are male or female, trust me.",Memoirs of a Geisha
135,gus120970,Sumptuous Asian Cinderella,7,28 November 2006,"Memoirs of a Geisha is very much a western film which basks in the spectacle of oriental exotica, as a backdrop for an archetypal western tale, the Cinderella Myth. The poor downtrodden girl, Chiyo, who emerges from poverty, destitution, sibling antagonism and domestic enslavement to beauty, acclaim and eventually claiming her 'Prince' against all the expectations of society, is the geisha of the title. Where Cinders wowed the ball with her pumpkin coach and crinoline, Sayuri arrives on the biggest pair of platforms you've ever seen and brings the house down with her dance as 'Japanese girl caught in a snowstorm'. Almost every scene along that path is painfully beautiful, evocative of what we think prewar Japan should be in terms of its paper houses, paper lanterns, little bridges and narrow streets. It's Japanese in the Western mind's eye in the way that Willow Pattern is Chinese. But while it may be unacceptably simplistic to some, it does bring out the undeniable difference in the world view in the formal and philosophical cultures of east and west. One element of the story I liked is that the whole impact of WWII, running concurrent to the story is completely obscured until it is over. Then the geisha is resurrected with a new purpose - as an attractive cypher for Japanese culture, literally a hostess for social and economic rehabilitation. It serves as an explanation of how we cannot quite relate to this vocation without seeing it as a respectable prostitute, because the film suggests it mutated into that at a time of national crisis. A bit long, a bit slow, but spiced up with a terrific performance from Li Gong as Sayuri's unbalanced Geisha nemesis, Memoirs is thought-provoking eye candy.",Memoirs of a Geisha
136,i_ianchev,Sayuri,9,1 March 2014,"The gentle standpoint of the Japanese woman...I guess you have all watches ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", the beautiful adaptation of Arthur Golden's book of the same name. This dramatic film does justice to the position not only of the geisha in the Japanese society, but it is also an embodiment of the innocence of the Japanese woman. I dare not say that there is no controversy in this movie - the lead female actresses are all Chinese. Though the depiction of the characters is so much true to the original. My opinion is such not because I understand all the qualities of the geisha performer, or the Japanese women, but as a result of the many various emotions and thoughts that this cinematic artwork awakens in me. The heartbreaking purity and vulnerability pierce through the silver screen into the viewer's mind like a clear chord from a Shamisen's stretched string.The movie follows the narrow path of poor Chiyo through the hardships of time and depicts the layering of an impeccable white powder mask. Despair and the driving forces behind the transition of the main character from the gentle Chiyo to the symbolic Sayuri. Romantic mystery and cruel reality wrap up the appealing of this powerful story. This film is about the power of the spirit which I guess most of the Japanese women have. Their obedience and timeless intimacy are two of the main characteristics which we all know. Also, we can see the world of the geisha depicted in details. It nurtures carefully, but also drains the natural desire for freedom. This harsh world imprints the sense that there is no alternative, but to live gracefully empty. The story though follows the historical turbulence of time and unites the two main characters at the end. Fate is involved like a thin invisible thread joining the dramatic parts of the story.The intimate music and the compelling visuals are so immersed that we ourselves feel deep compassion for Sayuri. Throughout her whole life she wants only one thing - to love and to be loved. The Chairman is that island of peace and happiness which she longs for. Do we all crave to express and feel? Aren't we all harboring such intimate dreams of fulfillment? Don't we all relate to the same heartfelt desire? I think that deep inside we are all the same.

137,nowonmai42,"Good stuff, but I still can't tie my obi properly",8,25 January 2006,"""To be a geisha is to be judged as a living work of art,"" says the legendary Mameha midway through director Rob Marshall's ""Memoirs of a Geisha."" Marshall clearly has the same hopes for his film version of Arthur Golden's wonderful book, and to say he only partially pulls it off is more observation than criticism. The film is stunningly beautiful, but its narrative focus on plot developments comes at the expense of the small details that made Golden's book so engrossing.""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is as visually evocative and alive as any film in recent memory. We're transfixed by the endless pathways of explosively red arches through which young Chiyo runs after meeting the Chairman (Ken Watanabi), around whom she will focus her life, and put on edge by the gleaming severity of the bamboo corridor that leads to Mameha's door, to which Chiyo delivers a priceless kimono that she's been forced to deface by Mameha's rival Hatsumommo. Growing up in an okiya, or geisha house, Chiyo is surrounded by the accoutrements of glamour, though is herself little more than a slave. Constantly abused by the tyrannical house geisha Hatsumommo (Gong Li), it's all Chiyo can do to avoid being thrown on the street. She barely understands what a geisha is, but can see that these elaborately dressed, painted women wield enormous power in the okiya.Herself destined for geishahood, Chiyo is selected for apprenticeship by Mameha (Michelle Yeoh), and given the nom de geisha Sayuri. The grown Sayuri (Zhang Ziyi) learns that geisha are not simply ornate prostitutes (though there is an element of that), but rather multi-talented performers who are masters of grace and precision. Golden lingered over these details; the exactness and specificity of kimono knots, hair styling, and makeup layering; the proper and improper ways to stand, sit, walk, and pour tea; the correct way to laugh at a client's jokes, and to make eye contact. In short, all the things that make professional socializing extremely difficult work. Marshall gives us glimpses of this, but by necessity is most focused on plot machinations. There's a lot to get through; Chiyo's childhood, conversion to Sayuri, infatuation with the Chairman, rivalry with Hatsumommo, complicated relationship with the Chairman's business partner Nobu, and the Second World War took Golden well over 500 pages. At 2.5 hours, ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" certainly takes its time, but viewers familiar with the book will notice what's missing as much as they'll enjoy what's on screen.It's not that ""Memoirs of a Geisha""'s plot is uninteresting; on the contrary, the war between Sayuri and Hatsumommo, conducted under public flirtations, smiles, and social niceties, is often riveting. Yet what made Golden's book so absorbing, and what could make this a great, not just good, film, is its setting in a world about which most of us know very little. The lives of geisha are a fascinating subculture under the already inscrutable (to Westerners) face of Japan. Without Golden's book, viewers of ""Memoirs of a Geisha,"" while treated to a visual banquet and engrossing story, will ultimately learn little of its enigmatic subjects and their lives.",Memoirs of a Geisha
138,blackberrybabe,Very (geisha) good,8,22 April 2006,"Although I haven't read the book, I saw the movie. And I liked it very much. I thought it was extremely well done; the cinematography is outstanding in the movie, and the costumes are out-of-this-world. All actors were well-cast. I know there was a big deal made about a Chinese woman playing a Japanese Geisha, but I did not find any fault in her performance. After all, they have to cast who is right for the role. And the subtle hints that the Chairman wants Sayuri kept my blood flowing. Talk about sexual tension! Great! I probably should've read the book first, but I didn't. Now that I've seen the movie, I plan to. If you're a fan of the book, you should like the movie. Even though it's probably different, it still reels you in and keeps your attention.

139,lurpak,Seen it all before,3,19 February 2006,"Review may contain insignificant spoilers, just the gist of the plot nothing too consequential.Move along, nothing to see here. I cannot believe the acclaim this ""hallmark channel quality"" film has been given. It starts off with a Dickensian scene of two children sold into sudo-slavery, identifies the cruel stepmother character (blossom, a fully qualified twenty year old geisha), after quickly forgetting her dead, mother father and lost sister, she unrealistically develops character through a series of chance meetings, forlorn love and over-characterised one dimensional people. The movie then follows her life through a period of about fifteen/twenty years including world war two (identified by the change of camera shade to the typical grey, and the removal of all clothing and background scenery with any colour other than greys, blacks and khakis') where she matures in wisdom as well as years while all those around her remain unchanged.In the end, the years of holding her tongue and doing right by the geisha instead of requiting her one true love (another chance meeting back when she was nine with ""the major"") a man in his mid thirties but don't let this worry you, when she gets to thirty he's still only thirty five. Typical Oscar nomination stuff, put forward by people who want to appear intellectual because this is the kind of film that panders to this pretence. If you fall for these Emperors new clothes style of film acclaim, then you can pretend you love it.Acting is unremarkable, heading towards boring, directing makes me feel like this was probably a good book ruined by skipping over too much that actually developed the plot. Most of the characters appeared and disappeared to quickly for you to grasp who they are and their relevance, only to be brought up again as key characters.

141,MeloDee,Memoirs of a Geisha was...,7,8 December 2006,"Memoirs of a Geisha is a difficult movie to review, because it consists of a variety of different elements. I must note also that I have never read the book before (though I would've liked to) so cannot compare and contrast between the film and the book in my review.One thing that I can say that I certifiably loved about the movie, was that they made it 2 hours and 30 minutes, thus allowing accurate time for all the events involved.Another thing that I enjoyed about the movie was the historical experience that it was. We got a chance to see Japan- though mostly from the geisha standpoint- before WWII. The scenery was very beautiful.The cast acted excellently, and they are really the best thing about the movie, and one of the reasons why I have given it this high a rating. Ziyi Zhang proves to be excellent- as usual.The main part of the plot, to be frank, is very weak. It is very difficult for me to believe that a girl, (the star, played by Ziyi Zhang) could fall in love with a man that she had only met on one occasion, and just because of his kindness to her on that one occasion dedicate her entire life to trying to be with him. Yes, geisha generally did not receive much kindness, but...you catch my drifting.Nevertheless, despite that weak main point, all of the details concerning the betrayals and controversies surrounding it prove to make a superb story. We are left to be sometimes sad, sometimes surprised, sometimes happy and other times confused, but all along we eagerly wait to see what will happen next.The one thing that bothers me more than that weak point in the plot, is the seeming glorification of the geisha lifestyle. In the movie, a main character calls geisha artists- which is not entirely untrue. Geisha were more dancers, musicians, and hostesses than they were prostitutes, but that morally questionable part of what they do still remained. We must also remember, that many of the girls who became geisha did not do so by will, but were sold by their poor- or greedy- parents. We must ask ourselves, no matter how much propriety or ""beauty"" may surround it, how healthy is it for a nation to encourage women to sell themselves for sex? Another thing that bothered me in the movie (which may have been done properly in the book) was the passage of time, especially after the war. We fail to get a real sense of time passing throughout the movie after Chiyo/Saiyuri grows up to adolescence/adulthood- or, more specifically, when Ziyi Zhang replaces Suzuka Ohgo in playing the part. They never make any effort to make her look any older, even though the other characters seem to be aging. The narration gives us pretty good hints, but those ""years and years"" never seem to show up properly on screen, and therefore it steals a chance for the audience to fully sympathize or empathize with Saiyuri's struggling.Apart from those, I did not notice any flaws in the movie. The movie was done tastefully, without many scenes of sex or violence. This is important in giving the audience a sense of the discretion that the geisha operated with. They did not have sex often or simply on a whim, they went through many circles and procedures, gaining popularity. Finally, they were bid upon, and then went only to the highest bidder, after which the cycle began again.The movie is forced to get a 7/10 because of its flaws, but it was an enjoyable movie, well-directed and narrated, and one that I would not have minded seeing again.",Memoirs of a Geisha
142,qatmom,Pretty soap opera,5,8 January 2006,"This is not a bad movie, but it isn't wonderful, either. Eliminate the eye-feast,take everyone out of costume, put them into more mundane settings, and what is left is a soap opera, a western soap opera written for western audiences.Things just happen. Somehow, Sayuri has blue eyes, but it is never explained why this matters or how she came by them.Somehow, even though a room is well on the way to being engulfed in flames, and the Ultimate Evil Asian Woman has set more of the building on fire, the building is not only still there in the morning despite being made of incredibly inflammable materials, so is the entire block. Did the Ultimate Evil Asian Woman hang around to watch the fire brigade? Somehow, Sayuri learns in 6 months what takes years of training for mere mortals to absorb. (A quintessentially American movie theme, which does not mean it is a bad thing...it's just not...Japanese.) ""Somehow"" is not good story telling. Every time the audience is jolted out of the story, wondering how the heck the whole block or maybe half the city did not go up in flames, they've been lost from the movie. Do this often enough, and no amount of visuals will compensate.Never do we really understand Sayuri. Is she perhaps dim-witted? Never do we know enough about her to be able to know what she wants or why. If we don't know, we cannot care,and for any story, if the protagonist can fall through an open manhole in the next scene, and nobody cares, this is not good story telling.Zhang Ziyi, Michelle Yeoh, and Gong Li are all wonderful actresses; I suspect they did the best they could with the material they were given, but for anyone unfamiliar with their other work--this by no means is their best.",Memoirs of a Geisha
143,iKramerica-1,Why shoot it in English if nobody can speak it?,5,9 November 2007,"I don't mean to sound disrespectful, but so many of the actors seem as if they barely know what they are saying, that they are reading lines phonetically the best they can, but are being directed and instructed in Chinese. It's like singing in Latin when you speak no Latin. But worse, the voice patterns and intonation were just so distracting.Why not just get Japanese actors and shoot it in Japanese with subtitles, or get Japanese actors who speak fluent English and shoot it in real English. It is not hard to find these actors, so why disrespect so many cultures with this mishmosh of Chinese actors playing Japanese roles in broken English. Who does it serve? At least in a film like ""Teahouse of the August Moon"" Brando's broken English was purposeful, as the sly conduit between the bombastic Americans and the tradition rich Okinawans, acting as a mockery of Asian stereotypes (he was smart for the audience's benefit, dumb for the Americans in the film). And the rest of the cast was Japanese, speaking Japanese, and conveying more emotion with a language I don't understand than the actors in ""Memoirs"" convey in ""English.""In ""Memoirs"" the broken English serves no purpose but to detract and distract. No wonder so many feel the emotion is missing in this movie. Emotion comes from a deep understanding of the text and expressing it with nuance. But when you are stumbling over your dialog, it's hard to be nuanced with delivery.Thus the best parts of this movie were the unspoken parts, where universal feelings like joy and despair can shine through.The movie itself was lavish and visually entertaining. But it takes more than that to make a great film...",Memoirs of a Geisha

Even when it comes to these fields, this movie truly excels. This is a character journey you want to see. Our leading lady is one who you want desperately to succeed and find happiness. The side characters however are equally compelling and memorable. That is not something I can say the same about other movies, save a handful. The visuals are also really beautiful.Admittedly, not having read the book and not being furious over the Chinese casting and the historical inaccuracies, has given me a more positive view of this movie. Which is odd, considering stuff like Dragon Ball white washing irks me and I'm aware of Feudal Japan culture. I think movies like this are simply of such high quality, things like these cannot bring them down. Much like Sayuri.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Sure, the sumo wrestling match was cool. Zhang's dance on the stage was cool. But apart from that, there was no rhythm, and without help from Rob Marshall, you're at the mercy of Yo-Yo Ma's yawn-inducing cello.

147,ikizdevran-882-254684,"The heart dies a slow death. Shedding each hope like leaves, until one day there are none. No hopes. Nothing remains.",5,4 August 2018,"Before starting my review, I would like to write a little bit about the term Geisha, who are they, and what they do. So, a Geisha is woman who is trained to entertain men with conversations, dances, songs and musical instruments. Even maybe under different names, Geisha were an important part of Japanese culture. Even though it is mentioned a lot times in the film, Geisha are not prostitutes, but highly trained and educated, beautiful women that exist for nothing but the pleasures of men. Similar women with similar purposes can also be seen in the Ottoman culture. They are taken from their homelands at the early age, sold to the palace, or for Japanese, to the pleasure house, and trained to entertain men. For Ottomans, they were trained in Harem only for the Sultan. This is one of the similarities between Turkish and Japanese cultures. Geisha wear the best traditional Japanese clothes, Kimono, and they are invited to special occasions and events to entertain special guests. They also sell their virginity to the highest bidder and become a real Geisha, I am not sure about accuracy of the last information, but this is how it was in the film. Based on the novel with the same name by Arthur Golden, ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" was released on December 9, 2005 in the United States. It is directed by Rob Marshall who is also known to be the director of 13 Oscar-Nominated film Chicago (won 6 of them). ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" was produced by Steven Spielberg, nominated for six Academy Awards and won three of them, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design. When you look at the categories in which ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" has won the awards, you can relate to its mystic story, artistic setup, foggy atmosphere and diverse camera angles.I have mixed feeling when it comes to this film. I am not really sure if I like it or not. There are good points and bad points in the means of story, atmosphere, casting and performances. The biggest mistake of the film is casting a Chinese Actress for the role of the Geisha, who is in the leading role of the film. She wears blue lenses just to create an impression of a blue-eyed Japanese woman, but everyone can see that those are not her real eyes. I wish they would have casted a Japanese woman with a natural beauty.I am not going to get into details, but I didn't like how Japanese men and women are presented in the film and how Japan is represented as a nation. I asked myself the question; Geisha are trained all their life, and choose this as a life style for this kind of men? This also shows the social status of Japanese women. Even today, when you look at the Japanese culture, you can barely see women in higher positions in the society. All this comes down to their history and traditions. In this point of view, ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is a very good example to understand modern Japan. Also, don't forget the fact that this is film is made by the Americans, and we know how they are willing to mislead the truth for their own benefits. Here, however, this is not the case because I have studied Japanese language and culture and I can vouch for the reality of this film.Getting back to film, I have enjoyed the environment very much. The atmosphere makes you live in that era. Houses that are very close to each other, Sakura trees, narrow roads and transportation harmonize you with the mood of the film. ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is a very realistic drama film. I mean, you really find yourself involved in the story. Two little girls are sold to a pleasure house and separated from each other. The one, whose memoirs we are watching, slowly reveals the real meaning of Geisha and its sacrifices. How she is used as a tool for the benefits of the men she used to entertain and love. After all, no matter how it is told in the film, Geisha are not really what they are presented to be. Soundtracks have a great influence in the story and its atmosphere. I have always found Japanese culture, traditions and history very peaceful, but this film made me question this a little bit. Even though what is told in the story may not be true, this is what I expect from a film. I would recommend this film for the people who are interested in Japanese life style. Also, this is a good source to see and feel the different, the sad face of Japan.",Memoirs of a Geisha
148,fierypoeticgirl,How I wish the Japanese had not sided with Hitler....,10,12 November 2007,"This film is beyond my words, and I have an excellent vocabulary. It's incredible that the cast person decided upon those which were casted. She or he? could not have done any better. Every character showed magnificent emotions revealing their hate, love, misery and the fact that Geisha's were ""used"" made it even more convincing. The Japanese had it worse than anyone. They are basically a peaceful culture, but when Hitler influenced them with his hypnotic speeches, well, as a poor country, what alternative did they have? Americans were hated because we knew how to master new technology which the Japanese now have mastered. The cast was so good it stunned me. The actresses were remarkably good and credible. The girls were second as it still is in the USA, but ladies, we've come a long way. We women need to stick together; all races of women. Let's not allow the men in this world to think he's the master of the universe. For instance, if the Bible is correct, God knew that Adam needed help!! Lots of help, so he invented the woman.

150,Nezz,Soap Opera Movie of the Year,8,14 January 2006,"I would like to present to you the film of 2005 that gets the coveted title ""Soap Opera Movie of the Year."" When I sat down to watch Memoirs of a Geisha, I knew I was in trouble because of the bad reviews the movie has received and also because of the way the movie opened. We get no explanation as to why these two young sisters are torn from their parents and forced to be slaves. It just happens.I would like to focus this paragraph on the troubles I had with the movie in a list. 1.) Why are these characters speaking English?? This was set in Japan before WWII and I think that the Japanese people there SPOKE Japanese. The most annoying aspect of this was that it was very very very difficult to understand the actors at times because they aren't native English speakers. I hope that doesn't sound too prejudice because it's not a dig at them, it's a dig at it being filmed in English. 2.) It was like two different movies. The first half dealt with seeing the life of a geisha and how you become one and the rivalry that happens within that circle. It was interesting to see how sacred the geisha were during pre-WWII times. But then the war happens and that is really when the movie went downhill...and fast. It was poorly executed and so ridiculously contrived. The romantic aspect of it was poorly put together as well, and the ending was rushed and overall last half was too choppy. There was not a great connection between the before and after of the war times, though it was nice to see how the geisha were sexed up after the war. 3.) Already mentioned this above, but the majority of this movie had so many soap opera aspects that it was initially becoming fun to laugh at, but overall it just became ridiculous. The rivalries between the geishas was seriously from an episode of a daytime soap opera, ditto the romantic aspect and the dealing with the war.Acting-wise, Ziyi Zhang was good, but nothing award-worthy here. I liked Gong Li, but I think the MVP of the movie acting-wise was Michelle Yeoh. I don't know what to think of Rob Marshall's work here. I didn't hate his work in Chicago, and I didn't love it either, but this was just...a mess. And the majority of it has to be laid on the doorstep of the director. I did love the art direction though and the score was nice at times though also a little too overpowering. Liked the cinematography. I read a shorthand review of the movie from a critic online that sums up the movie perfectly: a beautiful bore.I don't know if this story is adapted well since I have not personally read the source material, but I do know that if this was like the book, it's no wonder why it didn't work on screen. I don't even know if another director or the film being put in different hands altogether would have made much difference. Who knows, but all I know is that as is, this is bar none one of the worst movies I have seen this year. I can see why some would like it (like my mother, who loved it), but I am not one of them.",Memoirs of a Geisha
151,Strider-100,"Zhang Ziyi, Gong Li, and Michelle Yeoh all shine in one of the top five films of the year!",10,28 December 2005,"This film is like a version of Star Wars for Women. Ziyi Zhang, currently the most beautiful woman in the world, plays Sayuri, who is the equivalent of a young Luke Skywalker, the lovely Michelle Yeoh plays Mameha, who is like Sayuri's personal Obi-Wan Kenobi. Mameha takes young Sayuri under her wing and trains her to become the greatest and most famous Geisha of all time. The incredibly sexy and talented Li Gong plays Hatsumomo, who is like the Darth Vader character in this particular film who wants to destroy Sayuri. She is pure malevolent evil, but as I said the most incredibly sexy and beautiful evil you could ever imagine. The story also revolves around the romances these women have. The men they are involved with, Ken Watanabe as the Chairman, and Koji Toyoda as Nobu, and Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa did a fine job in support of these three women and played some very key roles in defining the Geisha's destinies so to speak. The young Sayuri, named Chiyo at that time, was well played by Susuka Ohgo and Tsai Chin did great as Auntie, and Kaori Momoi played Mother with flair. Unlike Star Wars, the weapons of choice in this movie are the words and emotional mind games played by the combatants. The dialog is fairly clever and there are some great moments where Ziyi and Gong Li go toe to toe with some terrific verbal jabs.A lot of nonsense has been brought up about the three lead actresses being Chinese, but these hypocrites have to look at the cold hard facts. Columbia Pictures is owned by Sony which is a Japanese company. They financed the film and called the shots. It is so hypocritical to attack Rob Marshall or the actresses. This is an English language film. The most famous Asian actresses known to Americans are these three women. They all have incredibly impressive resumes and they did a fantastic job. I was very impressed with Ziyi's ability to speak English and was very impressed by how fluent Gong Li is compared to when she filmed Chinese Box back in 1996 or 1998. Gong Li deserves a supporting actress Oscar for her work as well as Michelle Yeoh. Zhang Ziyi should take home the Best Actress Award.The cinematography is exceptional, the costumes and sets were all well done.I have read that Geisha is a dying art form. Tokyo has a population of only 300 geisha's out of 30,000,000 people. That is like .00001 percent of the population if I remembered the fraction correctly. I think the makers of this film might help people gain interest in the mysterious ""floating world"" of the Geisha which I think is positive and educational.Memoirs of a Geisha is in my top five best films of the year.1.

153,Norwegianheretic,Melodramas of a Geisha,3,12 December 2005,"Even though I haven't read the book, the huge gaps in the narrative (and the unbelievable leaps of logic we are asked to buy) are a dead giveaway that this is an adaptation. And, like most adaptations, there is something literary that, by not being there, gives the impression (false, I hope) that the book is a groansome melodrama.Now, as for the director's good name, it is permanently spoiled in my book. In fact, it makes me think that CHICAGO happened solely because of the brilliant construction that Bob Fossee and Kanter & Ebb had given it so many years before. Also, it is interesting to watch MEMOIRS with CHICAGO in mind because, in many ways, MEMOIRS is a faux musical. It's directed with a larger than life melodramatic tone that works with a musical and belittles a drama. As for the overly dramatic, let it be noted that much of the acting is hammy as hell, another negative for Rob Marshall.In summary, it pretty much stinks and so, it's a shoo in for a Best Picture Oscar.",Memoirs of a Geisha
154,Vash2001,A beautiful picture,8,4 February 2006,"I waited to see this movie because of the lukewarm reviews it got from the critics. Still I could not avoid seeing it because the subject was very interesting, and Rob Marshall is a good director. I also knew Zhang Ziyi from Crouching Tiger. How bad could this movie be? I went in with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised. This is a beautiful, sensitive movie, with strong characters and excellent performances. The music is wonderful. John Williams has used Yo Yo Ma's cello and I.Perlman's violin very effectively to create an atmosphere.The reviews I had read did mention the beautiful cinematography, but according to them there was nothing else. I strongly disagree. I have not read the book and I am not familiar with Japanese culture, particularly the Geisha culture. However, as the drama unfolded, I felt closely connected to the characters- even the mean ones. I was totally blown away by the performance of child actress Suzuka who plays the young Chiyo who later becomes Sayuri, the Geisha. The Japanese male actors were also very good, particularly Ken Watanabe, who I had seen in the Last Samurai. Gong Li was great as the mean Geisha. Michelle Yeoh is always good. I thought Zhang Ziyi should have been nominated for the best actress in a leading role Oscar. This is an unfamiliar field for her. She is not even Japanese. She had to learn all the intricacies of being a Geisha, and express the deep emotions. She is outstanding and she definitely carries the movie.I read that the poor showing at the box office may have hurt her chances. However, Mrs. Henderson or TransAmerica were not exactly blockbusters. I am afraid that the race of the characters may have been a factor. Even though there are emotions and drama in the movie, the expression is different in this culture. I am afraid that the critics and the public just did not get this movie. I wonder if it was too subtle for them? It does not have the usual Hollywood type violence/chase/sex type drama. I wonder if that is why the critics said it is stationary? I agree that the movie slows down in the middle, but it picks up speed again toward the end. Since i had not read the book I did not know how it ended. I was relieved that it had a relatively happy ending. The Geisha did not suddenly become a wife but she found the love she was seeking- something Geishas are not privy to.To me, it does not matter what race or nationality the actors are, as long as they perform well, and there is superb acting in this film. My own lack of knowledge of this culture was not a hindrance to my enjoyment of the movie. I think this is a superbly crafted movie and if someone is hesitant to see it because it did not get 4 stars from the critics, should definitely go see it for himself/herself. You may be pleasantly surprised just like I was.",Memoirs of a Geisha
155,henfish,This Movie DOES Contain Spoilers!!!,3,15 January 2007,"A Geisha is a virgin who gives up her virginity to a wealthy man in order that he be her patron... No? Have I got that wrong? Best watch the film again or, better still, read the book. That way I won't have to sit through unnecessary fractured English; tedious, un-involving and badly handled set pieces; hybrid set designs confused between what producers think is the best of Eastern cinema and what they think Hollywood will think is the best of Eastern cinema (confused? They certainly were!) and a string of 1/2 dimensional performances (Li Gong is stunning.. and stunningly awful.. but only the 1st among equals)!Ziyi Zhang is one of my favourite contemporary actors but, by God, she has her work cut out here. Her character (like the film and thus the audience) doesn't know whether it's coming or going! But in such an un-inventive, lazy fashion. Nothing adds up. The most predictable conclusions somehow seem to catch the characters off-guard. A prime example of this is Sayuri's reluctant wooing of Nobu at the Suomo fight. Not only is the dialogue she woos him with both lazy and forced - but she can be the only character on Earth who is surprised when he predictably (and unbelievably) falls for her. It's pretty much downhill from that point on as every cliché you hope wont happen does and, as moving as it is, the ending comes far to late to salvage the damage.Why oh why oh why is a musicals' choreographer tackling such artistically demanding subject matter!!!!!!! This is a poor Hollywood attempt to match the subtle beauty of the best Eastern cinema. It isn't remotely subtle and the beauty is only surface. Hey! Maybe they knew that and it's a perfect metaphor for the subject matter!!! Oh! A pig just flew past my window...On the plus side. Ken Wattanabe maintains much of the grace and poised demeanour missing from elsewhere and Suzuku Ohgo is a stand-out as the young Chiyo in the opening (and only decent) part of the film. But this is poor and tiresome fare. When the viewer doesn't have to work his brain watching a film, it turns off. Shortly afterwards - so does he!",Memoirs of a Geisha
156,asalem182,It was beauty that killed the film,7,28 February 2006,"I've been looking forward to Memoirs of a Geisha since the day it was announced. I'm very interested in the Japanese culture, the film has a great cast, it's Rob Marshall's follow-up to the Oscar winning Chicago, and it was co-produced by Steven Spielberg. So, I was quite disappointed after reading all the mediocre reviews. Anyway, I finally got the chance to see it, and while it's not the disaster the critics say it is, the film is definitely not as good as I hoped.The film tells the story of Chiyo, a nine year old girl, who is sold to a Geisha House in the 20's of the last century. 9 years later, Chiyo, AKA Sayuri (played by Ziyi Zhang), becomes the most celebrated Geisha in Japan, falls in love with The Chairman (Ken Watanabe), while his best friend Nobu (Kôji Yakusho) is completely falling for her. In the meantime, Sayuri and her mentor Mameha (Michelle Yeoh) must face the rivalry of Hatsumomo (Gong Li).Visually, Memoirs of a Geisha is terrific. It's probably the most beautiful film I've seen this year, and the Oscar nominations were well deserved. In every scene, you'll find something that will catch your eye whether it's the sets, the costumes, or the cinematography. John Williams' score was amazing too. I have to say that Rob Marshall definitely has an eye for beautiful shots. But I guess he paid too much attention to the beauty of the picture, he forgot to tell a good story.Plot-wise, the film wasn't very good. I felt the central love story between Sayuri and The Chairman was ridiculous. I never bought a 9 year-old girl falling for a man (who is at least 20 years older than her), just because he bought her an ice cream. Oh, how I wish it was that easy in real life. I know he was the first person to be nice to her, but I thought the whole thing was quite unbelievable. And it didn't help that Watanebe was on-screen for about 30 minutes, so we barely saw them talking to each other. The other characters were either over the top (The Mother), or stereotypical (Hatsumomo). The cast was solid, but frankly, nothing screamed Oscars to me. Yeoh was very good as the experienced Geisha. Li did her best, but you can't go far with a character as 2-dimensional as it gets like Hatsumomo. Zhang was decent and Watanabe was bland. I expected much more from him after his excellent turns in his recent films. And I wasn't bothered by the language issue the majority of the critics were concerned about.So, I'd recommend watching Memoirs of a Geisha. It's a case of style over substance, but when the style is that good, who cares?",Memoirs of a Geisha

Ron Marshall, being the director of acclaimed musical, Chicago, definitely brings that extravagant and lavish air in this movie.Costume design was great, and cinematography was just astounding, the best cinematography I've ever seen(especially the temple scene). The choreography of the snow dance scene definitely left me in awe.The thing that I was a little uncomfortable with in the movie, was the acting. Gong Li stole the spotlight from Zhang Zi Yi. Her seductive allure emanates throughout the movie, although she is the antagonist. I found it hard to digest Zhang Zi Yi's character, because I felt that she portrayed a confused character rather than one with a strong conviction.The movie is great, but definitely, it seems to be a little bit boring nearing to the end.",Memoirs of a Geisha

But such beauty, also. The film is stunning in it's beauty-- the women, costumes and settings. You feel both the powerlessness these girls feel in their restricted lives, and the power they held... when the man crashes on his bicycle when the geisha catches his eye... Fantastic movie, worth seeing again. The only negative point is that the actors were not Japanese. With the historic clash between Japan and China, it makes no sense that Chinese actors were cast in this.

I didn't mind that the three leading ladies were Chinese (i mean, europeans have done roles as Americans, australians, italians etc) but its really the English that makes the film hard to bear. IT feels somewhat out of place in this Japanese story, in particular Ken Watanabe was very hard to understand in some scenes, such as the cherry blossom bit. Ziyi Zhang gives a good performance, but i have to agree with most critics, that you don't really care what happens to her, whereas in the novel I did. This is a very Hollywood adaption, as the novel is much more focused on the hardships of the training and rivalry. Sayuri finished the training in the film so quickly, it made it look like it was so easy! Gong Li, I have to say is beautiful and should win best villain for her role. But her English is a drawback, though it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.Overall, the film is satisfactory, but I wouldn't mind another remake if a director is able to make one, with actors who can speak proper English, or if not, cast actors who can speak Japanese so subtitiles can be used.",Memoirs of a Geisha

The conclusion felt rushed. Acting was excellent all around. Comprising some of Japan and China's most famous actors, the excellent performances were to be expected. Especially wonderful was the strength of the female characters in the film. Ziyi Zhang looked stunning throughout and lended her character the right amounts of innocence and integrity needed to make the audience root for her. But the best performance comes from Li Gong. Its a shame she didn't garner a best supporting actress nod for this fim. Among the rest of the cast, Michelle Yeoh was wonderful as Zhang's protegee, Kaori Momoi and Tsai Chin lended the film some comic relief as the owners of the Geisha. Ken Watanabe is as usual, excellent as Zhang's love interest in the film. Lastly, the films camera-work, sets, costumes, and score by John Williams is absolutely breathtaking.

Because of this and her falling off the roof when she tries to escape, the mother of the house decides to make Chiyo a mere servant girl until she has paid off her debt. One day, Chiyo meets a handsome and charming man, who buys her a cup of sweet ice, and from that moment on she is in love with him and tries to everything to win his heart, such as to become a true geisha. Years later, Mameha decides to adopt Chiyo as an apprentice and she can finally fulfill her dream of becoming a geisha and to reunite with the chairman she desires above everything else.Cynics will say that this is just a feminist propaganda film for women, but it really is a stunning and powerful film about women, or rather their strength and determination in a culture and profession that is quite different than the view Western countries often seem to have of it. Geishas were dancers, artists and mistresses, who satisfied their customers through their skills, and not their bodies, selling themselves away like common prostitutes. It's amazing to see how being a geisha is really about learning self-discipline and control of ones body, and essentially that is the process Chiyo, or Sayuri as she is later called, goes through in this wonderful, exotic and moving film. I was interested in the psychology and personality of every single character, particularly Sayuri and Hatsumomo, who almost redefine the word ""catfight"" in this film, through the game of intrigues, betrayal and lies they play with each other. Hatsumomo is the villain of this movie, yes, but when she is on screen for the last time I really did feel sorry for her, because despite her arrogance and rotten character, she was capable of love and was denied her feelings by the boundaries and limitations of the life she swore herself to. On the other hand, the geishas are shown to be true artists and athletes, who have to have complete dominance of their posture, their moves and their timing. The most beautiful scene in this movie, which will most likely cause everyone to get goose bumps, is when Sayuri goes through her training to become a geisha and the sensitive, but emotionally gripping score by John Williams is heard, particularly when she receives the task of captivating a man through one single glance. Whether the film was perfectly historically accurate in its portrayal of the hardships the geishas face, is something I don't know much about, and that's probably a good thing as it would have destroyed the haunting spell of the movie. The film is truly beautiful in its production design and the gorgeous cinematography and is just as much a work of art for the eye as it is for the heart. Rob Marshall really managed to hit the right tone and doesn't make ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" overly sentimental, but created an intimate love story, where Sayuri always wants to follow her heart and her desire to become a geisha, and ultimately realize that she cannot have both.The film also features the who's who of Asian actresses, starting with the pretty Ziyi Zhang, who gives a haunting and mesmerizing performance as Sayuri, especially when she performs her art of dancing and charming men. Her eyes are captivating and she has exactly the right aura to play such a role, and nobody except the Japanese will say something about her being Chinese in reality. The same goes for Michelle Yeoh, who has a hypnotic presence as Sayuri's master Mameha, and especially the stunning Gong Li, who is perfect as the seemingly cold-hearted and spoiled, but really desperate Hatsumomo. Ken Watanabe, who already showed his powerful screen aura in ""Last Samurai"" plays a much more low-key character this time, but he has charisma and kindness written all over him.""Memoirs of a Geisha"" does not deserve its reputation as a film that only lives from its visuals and production achievements, although those are indeed the strongest point of the film. It tells a passionate and moving love story, involves a lot of cultural history, and is so beautifully photographed and scored that it becomes a grand cinematic adventure, that will apply to both genders and every person who wants to be reminded of the great class of movies.",Memoirs of a Geisha
164,cloudsponge,A Mind-Boggling Failure,2,22 December 2005,"The trouble with the book, ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is that it had Japanese surfaces but underneath the surfaces it was all an American man's way of thinking. Reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music, sets, and costumes yet performed by barnyard animals dressed in those costumesso far from Japanese ways of thinking were the characters.The movie isn't about Japan or real geisha. It is a story about a few American men's mistaken ideas about Japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions. So what is this movie if it isn't about Japan or geisha? Is it pure fantasy as so many people have said? Yes, but then why make it into an American fantasy?There were so many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hang-ups, no connotations of sin about sex. Sex is natural and normal. How is sex handled in this movie? Right. Like it was dirty. The closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has Sayuri wrinkling up her nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch. Does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie? Nope. One character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she doesn't want to get caught doing something dirty. Such typical American puritanism has no place in a movie about Japanese geisha.Did Sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off? Nope. She lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block. Of course she isn't supposed to enjoy it. And that is what I mean about this movie. Why couldn't they have given her something to enjoy? Why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrong?Behind Mameha the Chairman was Sayuri's secret patron, and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity. He could have rigged the auction and won her himself. Nobu didn't even bid. So why did the Chairman let that old codger win her and, reeking of old-man stink, get his fingers all over her naked body? Would any woman ever really forgive a man for that?Let's try to make sense of this. By being behind Mameha the Chairman incurred debts for Sayuri's geisha training. In order to recoup his debts the Chairman had Sayuri sold to Dr. Crab. Through Mameha the Chairman sold Sayuri's sexual favors to that old geezer so that the Chairman could make some money out of her. The Chairman wasn't her patron. He was her pimp! Some romantic love story.Yes, the film is gorgeous but it is like the beauty of a very attractive, alluring transvestite whose voice, appearance and every touch are thrilling. But under that very feminine surface lies an ominous secret. Under the incorrectly appearing Japanese surface of the film lurks the ominous secret that the heart, soul, spirit and core of this film is entirely American and male. Not the best thing to be if it is trying to be other than a lie, distortion, and terribly wrong.Some contrasts between Japan and MOAG:Japanese style  Refined, elegant simplicity. MOAG style  Peking Opera.Japanese geisha  Hair swept up. MOAG geisha  Loose hair which surely must have gotten all gunked up in the thick paste of white makeup.Japanese shaved ice - Japanese are rather strict about seasonal observances. Shaved ice is strictly a summer treat. MOAG shaved ice - The Chairman buys Chiyo, the young Sayuri played by the marvelous Suzuka Ohgo, this treat during cherry-blossom-viewing season. The thought made my entire body shiver with cold.Japanese geisha  Trained and skilled entertainers. MOAG geisha - sluts.Japanese wind chime - Used in the summer because hearing the sound it makes, thanks to the breeze, Japanese people feel somehow cooler. MOAG wind chime - a door bell! If a person stood in front of another's house and made noises with a wind chime they would be considered a lunatic, not gain entrance.Japan  Emphasis on human relationships, group oriented. MOAG  ""I want a life that's mine"" American individualism.Japanese traditional dance  Refined elegance. An almost geometrical and mechanical precision. MOAG dance  Martha Graham freaking out on LSD while wearing a not-very-auspicious white Japanese funeral shroud. Performed by a geisha down a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club? Ha ha ha! Is a strip club where they did most of their research on geisha?Japan house fire  Setting or even letting a fire break out is worse than murder because it poses such a dire threat to the community. Fires can rip through those wooden villages, towns, and cities destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people. MOAG house fire - Great adjunct to a fight scene but there are zero ramifications and because it is no longer needed the out-of-control fire miraculously puts itself out. Technically the movie ended here because at the very least Sayuri would have been ostracized and joined her sister among those never heard from again. Which is where both Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall should be exiled.Enough. The movie stinks.",Memoirs of a Geisha
165,bootlebarth,Subtitles please,6,31 January 2009,"All adaptations of books are tosh. When the book is written by a Caucasian man about the vanished life of geishas in Japan, you shouldn't expect too much.As we know in the west, all Asians look the same, so who cares whether the cast are Japanese or Chinese? Basically (here come the spoilers) this is a story about a sub-teen who is sold into geishadom. After lots of gloom, rain, brutality and unkindness, our geisha-in-the- making has a rare moment of delight. A rich 'Chairman' buys her a cherry-flavoured ice drink. She yearns to meet him again, and he - in the typical way of pulp fiction - never forgets her. Despite all the intervening intrigues, wars and bonking with American colonels and Japanese doctors, all ends happily.Apart from the first few minutes of unsubtitled Japanese, or whatever, everyone speaks fractured English, often in more impenetrable accents than the average Hollywood mumble-film (No Country For Old Men, etc). This film strains the eyes and the ears to their limits.Visually there is much to keep the eyes engaged, but TMOAG is a film that promises more than it delivers. On the plus side, nobody talks on the phone and there are no car chases.What are we left with? A glib plot, sumo wrestlers, absurd dances and paper-thin characters.

168,JimSDCal,A very good film,8,23 December 2005,"""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is a beautifully photographed film with an excellent story. I never read the best-seller but still found the plot to be compelling.Chiyo and her sister are sold to 2 separate geisha houses to be trained to enter that way of life. In Chiyo's she almost immediately runs afoul of Hatsumomo, who is already a geisha. Hatsumomo is jealous of Chiyo's potential as a geisha and they have a life-long rivalry.Because of Hatsumomo's conniving and her own attempts to reunite with her sister by running away, Chiyo becomes the slave of the woman running her geisha house. She almost give up hope, but the kindness of ""the Chairman"", who buys her flavored ice and gives her some money, revives her spirit and Chiyo vows she will someday be a geisha.When Chiyo is trained as a geisha her name is changed to Sayuri, and she immediately attracts the attention of many men, but she longs only for the Chairman. Her rivalry with Hatsumomo continues, as Hatsumomo and Sayuri's patron both want their protégé's to be ""adopted"" by the woman running the geisha house.At film's end, Japan's loss in WW II changes everything. Geisha's become westernized and some are more prostitute than geisha. Sayuri, however, retains hope that someday she might be reunited with ""the Chairman"" and fall in love.I think this film has an excellent chance to be nominated for some of the more technical awards - cinematography, make-up, score and others - at the Oscar's. The woman playing Sayuri, Zhi Zyang (?), was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Actress and she too could be nominated for an Academy Award",Memoirs of a Geisha

What a pleasure to listen to a haunting, and emotional soundtrack throughout the movie with such talented solos as Yo-Yo Ma on the cello and Itzhak Perlman on the violin, and of course the impeccable composing by John Williams. Without this class of music and some very stimulating cinematography, this movie would have been worth only a ""3"" or ""4"". Story was slow to develop and sometimes hard to understand the dialogue, but did have an interesting twist towards the end. Basically, another love story but with the background of a geisha being developed from a young girl. Always a pleasure to see Ziyi Zhang, but felt she was better in her action movies ""Hero"", ""Crocuhing Tiger..."", and ""House of Flying Daggers"".What kept me awake through the movie was the entrancing music.",Memoirs of a Geisha

172,homespun13,Disappointing,3,27 May 2012,"I found this movie disappointing and tedious, almost painful to watch. The plot was difficult to follow. Most of the movie takes place in semi-darkness, which is not a pleasant situation visually. I had real difficulty telling the female actresses apart and also considerable difficulty following the plot. I cannot judge how authentic the movie was in terms of portraying Japanese culture of that period, as I know nothing about it myself. So I can't judge authenticity, I can only judge the entertainment value, which was rather low. The tale itself was simply not interesting enough and I kept wondering through the movie ""why would anyone want to make this story into a movie?"" However, I did manage to sit through the whole movie, which I thought was quite an accomplishment, since the tediousness was really getting to me. I have no idea why the movie has been described as a love story. The ""love"" element, if it can even be called that, is so minor. Overall, my recommendation is skip this movie, watch something else instead.",Memoirs of a Geisha
173,hotfrederick,A bowl of instant ramen ...,2,25 January 2006,"Andrewjlau, I could not agree more. My girlfriend is watching this at this very moment, and I find this movie appalling. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend, laughing: ""They are doing all this for a man!?"" I find these women have no intensity, no sense of the a fight between tragedy and identity, and that these men are hardly worth fighting for. During the dance scene where Zhang Zi Yi wins them over, the men look stupid more than admiring.Japanese people have much more intensity than Chinese people, and being geisha is Japanese culture. I am sure the Chinese had something similar, but the faces do not match the main.Anyway, the dialogue is so unmysterious, so American. Had a European done it with European orientals, they would have done a far better job.I have to add: it seems most of the people who liked the film are American. Sorry to say, but no wonder. All spelt out for you, not instinctive, not passionate. I think the Chinese actresses are lovely, but I could not say they were good actors in this film. Yes, the cinematography is great, but really, I cannot see how it can be seen that these characters are complex, deep individuals.I'm going to Japan to see the real thing. I am sure that would be amazing to see.",Memoirs of a Geisha
174,Bunty-at-IMDB,"Beautiful, but hallow",7,10 August 2010,"Memoirs of a Geisha is a film which will be remembered for its top notch production values. Awesome cinematography by Dion Beebe, mystical music by John Williams, Colleen Atwood's stunning oriental costumes and beautiful production design and sets by John Myhre. But alas, the story itself is very bland and the film resolves into nothing.Rob Marshall is known for its pretty films - generally with beautiful music and rememberable cinematography. His previous film, Chicago swept major Oscars at its time, but for Geisha, we can't expect anything but technical awards.A major thing that people complain about is the film's Chinese cast, playing Japanese characters. However, the nationality does not matters if the actors are good enough. Ben Kingsley played Mahatma Gandhi, and no one complained because the acting was marvelous. But in Geisha, all the actors performed somewhat average, and no one really did anything great in terms of acting. However, Li Gong did fairly well out of the others. Ziyi Zhang was plain average, and Michelle Yeoh provided the necessary 'geisha' grace in the film which other female leads lacked.The very heartbreaking thing is that the screenwriter Robin Swicord did not properly researched about the Japanese traditions and Geishas in particular. As Roger Ebert said, ""The more you know about Japan, the less you like the Memoirs of the Geisha"". His characterization is very weak and the bond between Sayuri and the Chairman never becomes compelling. There was no chemistry between the both lead actors, Ken Watanabe and Ziyi Zhang hardly had any strong scenes together. Rob Marshall himself looked as if he is very busy in showing the beautiful locations and camera work by Dion Beebe properly and he hardly cared about the character development.Never the less, the film is not the worst film by an American on Japanese culture. But it is not great either. The film is decent, and by its end, it feels that you saw a beautiful film, but not a great film. And yes, the film is very very stunning, the shining Kimonos, lovely Japenese gardens and beautiful women dancing in vivid lighting done by Dion Beebe, Cello and Violin solos by Yo Yo Ma and Izthak Pearlman, respectively, under the composition of John Williams are all very unforgettable. In short the film is beautiful, but hallow.",Memoirs of a Geisha
175,mouse_robot,somewhat compromised but still engrossing,9,29 July 2006,"I absolutely adore this movie. Every single frame is a shiny piece of motion picture candy. This is quite possibly the prettiest movie ever made. Yet for all of the beautiful sets costumes and cinematography, I'm never distracted from the incredibly moving story. On a certain level, it's not much more than a Dickensian rags to riches melodrama. But does it matter if it's a conventional story as long as it works? I've seen the movie five times on DVD and I get sucked in every time as if it's my first time watching it. I guess I only really have one major complaint about the movie: I wish they would have kept the ending of the book. It was somewhat sad to hear the editor admit on one of the commentary tracks that the original not-so-happy ending didn't test well with audiences so they changed it to a happier ending. It's not really a happy story, so it makes little sense that it should have a happy ending. Such is the reality of Hollywood I suppose.",Memoirs of a Geisha
176,dunbare,OK Memoirs,7,2 February 2007,"I would have given this movie a nine or ten if I had not read the beautiful book it was based on. The movie is almost a disappointment! The film is of course is about the striking blue eyed Japanese child Chiyo who will become one of the greatest Geisha in Gion the lovely Sayuri.The plot of the film is very much a Cinderella story set in 1930's Japan. The child Chiyo enters life into an Okiya after being torn form her sister after her parents death. She is a servant who is training to become a geisha. She lives in the powerful Nitta Okiya where resides the toast of Gion Hatsumomo. Once Chiyo gets a little older politics enter the picture as Hatsumomos rival Mameha pulls Chiyo under her wing and helps her become Sayuri. The motivations behind Mamehas sudden interest in CHiyo/Sayuri seem like a nice big slap in the face to Hatsumomo ( who is training the lost cause Pumpkin as competition for Sayuri). The real story has to do with a Chairman, Sayuri met as a child and his affections for her.***********SPOILERS************** 1. There were many things wrong with the movie, but I loved the makeup and costumes. They are really beautiful. 2.The actress Gong Li who portrayed Hatsumomo definitely deserved an Oscar. While reading the book I really had no idea what Hatsumomo would look like, only that she most definitely was beyond beautiful and certainly Gong Li surpassed that description. She acted the part well. Hatsumomo was an arrogant witch who had the talent of being completely cruel while looking angelic.3. Sayuri played by Zhang Ziyi could not have been more perfect. She had the doll face and sweet, demure innocence of Sayuri. 4. I was not pleased with the casting of mother, pumpkin or Mameha. Mother was a wretched looking woman, while the actress certainly played the mother as the money hungry woman she was, I think it would have been important to be more accurate in casting actors that are described in the book. The descriptions are very detailed and mother was a saggy skinned woman who has bloody gums, brown teeth, cloudy yellow eyes that were rimmed with the bright ""raw meat looking"" eyelids. The woman was grotesque and the actress who played mother was actually quite attractive. Pumpkin did not have the lovely round face described and did not at all stick her tongue out that gave her her nickname Pumpkin......disappointing. Mameha, while Michelle Yeoh seems like a good Mameha she is too old. She acted Mameha as described in the book, but I did not buy her portrayal because she just did not look like Mameha. Mameha was a couple years younger than Hatsumomo and had very chalk white smooth skin. Michelle Yeoh not only looked older than Hatsumomo, but she never wore any of the requisite chalk white geisha makeup...none! 5. Hatsumomo while one of my favorite characters at times looked a little dumpy. There is a scene where she is wandering the streets looking angry at posters of Sayuri. Her hair is down and it looks like she has on a simple bathrobe. Hatsumomo was a woman always dressed like a queen and walked like one and no geisha would ever wear their hair down the way she had it...not even Hatsumomo.6. Hatsumomos final breakdown is not at all depicted as it happened in the book. This of all things should not have been ignored! She had a very embarrassing incident with a Kabuki actor occur that solidified her disgrace. She was actually kicked out of the Okiya and no one knows what happened to her...that important piece of info is sadly lacking in the film.7. Sayuri's decline from the geisha life is too sudden. The scenes of her being trained in dance, tea and makeup are my favorite, but it all ended too quickly. It did not really capture just how high of a geisha she became....it was over too soon.8. My favorite scenes of course are the ones with Sayuri undergoing transformation from chiyo the child to Sayrui the star. The music played as her face is being powdered and her hair being tortured by wax is fitting.This is a great film to watch for anyone who is interested in Japanese culture or the life of a geisha it is one of the most beautiful films to come out in recent years and while not faithful to the book, I enjoyed it and would encourage people to see this movie.",Memoirs of a Geisha
177,max-vernon,Romantic love story set in exotic location.,8,14 January 2006,"Looking at the reviews so far, it is clear that people have differing expectations of a period film which is based on a work of complete fiction. Questions of authenticity, ethnicity (the use of Chinese actors), emotional integrity and trueness to the novel are those most commonly raised.Firstly, the question of authenticity. I recently read a real Geisha memoir - 'Geisha of Gion', published by Simon & Schuster in 2002. Nothing I saw in the film contradicted what I had read in the book. The film does not glamorize Geisha life and the first half-hour is almost unremittingly dark. The film could have explained more about Geisha training but that was not its purpose. It is not a documentary of Geisha life but a feature film which aims to entertain. It does not dumb down. It does not provide a detailed socio-political portrait of Japan during the tumultuous '30's and '40's. That is not its purpose and would have detracted from the central story it tells. The film successfully recreates the period in which it is set including the poverty that drove Japanese to sell their daughters and which also prodded the militarists into war. This historical background is not allowed to intrude into the dynamics of the story being told. The central characters dominate the film and that is to its advantage.Secondly, the question of ethnicity. Asia is a continent packed with mongoloids of differing ethnicity and hue. There are striking differences between Japanese, 'hairy' Ainu, and Koreans. China hosts a variety of Chinese and non-Chinese populations. The film's more intimate scenes shows some of these physical differences to a discerning eye. In particular, Kaori Momoi's (Mother) classic Japanese nose shape contrasts with those of the three Chinese actors with whom she converses whilst puffing on her pipe. Most Westerners find these differences difficult to detect and the ethnicity question is not really an issue.The decision to use 3 famous Chinese actors in leading roles was clearly a commercial one and is a tribute to the rising influence of the Chinese martial arts film industry. The 3 actors give convincing performances although purists will disagree about the gracefulness of their movements and body language.The ethnicity question is really one for Chinese and Japanese audiences. The Japanese did terrible things in China and had no doubts about the ethnic differences between themselves and their victims. Japan's failure to fully acknowledge its war crimes lies at the root of this problem. Chinese people are still clearly sensitive about the sufferings endured in the darkest period in their history. In contrast, Germany's de-Nazification and atonement has provided a new start in its relations with Russians, Poles, Jews etc. It is difficult to envisage even the slightest controversy arising from the cross-use of actors from these ethnic backgrounds. Ethnicity still carries a lot of cultural baggage but this is being eroded by globalisation and an increasing mixture of populations. As an historian, I would not wish to see film used to whitewash the past as Hollywood still does with regard to African-Americans.Thirdly, emotional integrity. Some reviewers feel that the film left them cold. In this respect, I think that that 'Memoirs of a Geisha' feels more like a European film. The use of a narrator, the concentration on character and dialogue, the slow pace and the director's decision to keep visual spectacle to a minimum all help to take this film away from Hollywood shallowness. Substance does triumph over style. Emotion is not 'laid on with a trowel'. In this respect, the film is surely closer to the Japanese social norms of the period it depicts. The idea that romantic love could find a satisfying fruition within such a culture may indeed be far-fetched. But that is the purpose of the genre. This film is a Mills & Boon romance set in an exotic location. It is a good piece of film-making and an excellent introduction to the world it portrays.Fourthly, trueness to the novel. Having never read the book, I can only state the obvious. Film is an entirely different medium and aesthetic experience. A screenplay develops its own dynamics and rules. It can never replicate the reading experience. My only concern is for the reading experience of those who come to the novel after first seeing the film. The reader's own imagination usually means that the novel provides a deeper and more emotionally satisfying experience than any film can replicate. 'The book is always better than the film.' The reader's imagination must be stunted by the film experience coming first and I do worry about film undermining literacy among the young. In particular, works of fantasy such as 'The Lord of The Rings' are in great danger of losing their imaginative force: Gandalf has become Ian McKellen until the end of time.",Memoirs of a Geisha

179,TwoThirdsMajority,Japanese Top Gun...,7,30 January 2006,"Memoirs of a Geisha is a movie which is beautiful in most parts, and funny in the other. The beautiful thing: Japan, the girls, the atmosphere, and the music. The funniest thing? The accents and the narration. For example: ""You can't say to the sun, more shine. You can't say to the rain, more rain"".But in the movie, it sounded more like this: ""Yu kant se tu da san. mo san. Yu kant se to da ren, mo ren."" Seriously, the voice acting and the narration itself is the funniest thing ever. I laughed my ass off when listening to their accents. Zhang Ziyi's English is quite amusing, while Bond girl Michelle Yeoh has the lamest accent ever, because Michelle Yeoh has a British accent you know. But Ken Watanabe's English is quite good, thanks to the Last Samurai & Batman Begins.About the acting. It's pretty good. Although they had bland Japanese accents, their acting is quite good. Leave the Chinese people behind. Zhang Ziyi had some pretty good moves to be a geisha, so did Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh.The 1940s Japan portrayed in this movie actually does look the same as the 1940's Japan in real life. However, i noticed that the roads do are not wide enough for vehicles while the bridges are not able to support heavy 1940's trucks. But that's my opinion.Despite the humorous Japanese accents shown in the movie, the acting, the direction and the atmosphere makes this movie a watchable experience. However, Rob Marshall shouldn't direct this movie because this movie, although good, looks more like Katamari Damacy than The Last Samurai.

We see her innocence, her fear, but one thing we fail to see is that she is actually an intelligent girl, and in this way, the script does not do justice to young Chiyo. She did not demand to see her sister Satsu in her first meeting with Mother. In fact, the nickname Pumpkin, was given to Puumpkin by Chiyo, herself, and it caught on, a small detail which have shown viewers young Chiyo's gift with expression.Zhang Ziyi portrayed her role of the older Chiyo, and later Sayuri well. Her expression in her dance, her smile, her passion was captured brilliantly by Ziyi. But while she may have done well in those areas, it is difficult to get a Chinese girl to portray a Japanese role.Kaori Momoi portrayed her role as Mother well. She was shrewd and calculative, attributes which served her very well, especially during the war years.As with every book to film transition, there are inaccuracies, but the version on film manages to stay quite true to the character development in the book, except for one role, i.e., the role of Hatsumomo.Hatsumomo was a very scheming woman in the book, and the role, unfortunately, was poorly executed by Gong Li, and admittedly, quite badly written as well.Mameha's role was surprisingly played well by Michelle Yeoh, even though she looked nothing like the Mameha in the book. But she played her role with such conviction and passion, and well, Michelle does have the look of a mentor, so I suppose Rob Marshall did pick a good Mameha (in terms of character, but in terms of looks she was far off the mark). Every time I read the book, I think that Yui Natsukawa had the looks which matched quite close to Mameha in the book. Remake anyone? Youki Kudoh. Finally, another Japanese name. Why couldn't they get Japanese for all the roles? It puzzles me. She did justice to the role as Pumpkin. The girl who was Sayuri's best friend. The girl who became the favorite of the American soldiers because of her crude ways. The girl who betrayed Sayuri.Ken Watanabe and Kôji Yakusho portrayed their roles well as the Chairman and Nobu. My only criticism about the script? Nobu isn't that unfriendly to Sayuri, and would never sell her off to the Americans as suggested. He honors friendship above all else.The dialog between the Sayuri and the other characters was well written. I did not have trouble understanding Ziyi's English, nor Gong Li's English, but you can tell they had a bit of trouble speaking English in general.The part that troubles me greatly is that General Tottori's name is mentioned, but it is not specified who he is. He is in fact (for those who have not read the book) Sayuri's first danna, and this made Nobu angry with Sayuri at first as he had always wanted to be Sayuri's danna.The other thing that troubles me is that while the characters were shown to have aged, the Chairman seem to have stayed the same! Why, Rob Marshall, why? Some parts of the soundtrack (eg, when Sayuri is on the mountain, throwing away the handkerchief after the Chairman caught her with Colonel Derricks) sounded more Chinese than Japanese! Shigeru Umebayashi, you are hereby needed for the soundtrack if the show is ever remade! A show in desperate need of a remake. Get more Japanese names, please!",Memoirs of a Geisha
181,tvsterling,Not For Geisha Snobs,9,10 May 2009,"I am a fan of Japanese silkscreen prints, many of which are wonderful portraits of famous Geisha. There are also street scenes, sumo & landscapes, lots of rain & snow. I could not help but see an homage to these prints in the film. Not a slavish copying of them but a healthy interaction between film & the spirit of those prints. Most DP's & cinematographers have a firm grounding in the fine arts & so this is no surprise. These prints were the first mass medium, predating our newspapers by at least a hundred years. This is why the film is such a visual feast. Of course the fact that the subject (geisha) are a costumers & makeup artists dream didn't hurt. The four main geisha were played by women truly beautiful & talented enough to have been real famous geisha of the old flower and willow world. The fact that they are not Japanese, even worse mostly Chinese, puts an unfair political cast on the film. They were obviously the best actresses for the parts even though Japanese national pride was supposed to be ruffled a bit. The average non involved Japanese movie goer did not seem to be offended. To me the film is truly enchanted, a hypereal evocation of one of the essential oriental mysteries. If you want point by point pedantic illustration of this unique cultural event rent a documentary. If you want the spirit this movie is more than adequate. The old Japanese Prints (The Floating World ) & the unspoiled Geisha world died together at about the time of the movie along with what is loosely termed 'Old Japan'. It is, of course, a three hanky chick flick but certainly not as bitchy & sobby as the worst of those. More of a historical drama with chick flick undertones. Truly great film.",Memoirs of a Geisha
182,foxface,Memoirs of a Lifetime movie,4,7 January 2006,"This movie is beautiful to look at, just like the geishas and their costumes in the film.The film is a moving mosaic of beauty, but beneath the surface, I'm not sure I was allowed to feel what needed to be conveyed. There was a tone in this movie that didn't ring true for me. I don't know if this was due to a male directing the film, American screenplay writers, the acting/casting. Whatever it was, at the end of the movie, I didn't feel the need to go singing its praises to anyone at all. In fact I felt relieved. The pacing of this movie was very slow, and I feel 30 to 45 minutes could have been cut, and wouldn't have affected the story line. This movie could have easily been a mini-series on TV or a high brow Lifetime movie? I'm serious about the Lifetime. Think about it, the film had many lifetime movie elements: the required female rivalry, a tragedy that removed the heroine from her life as she knew it, a struggle for love, then a sappy ending. This movie had Asian actors, but the story felt like it was written from a Western point of view, that tried to give a sympathetic overview of a geisha lifestyle. Maybe that was the problem. Perhaps, by trying to make this movie accessible to western audiences, they lost focus and their ambition was stilted. Don't expect this movie to get an Oscar nomination for best picture of the year. Look for Oscar to give a nod to the costume/make-up departments instead. This film had a lot of hype, but never delivered.

Groomed to be a geisha, the course of her life is immediately swept into the uncontrollable currents of daily circumstances. One day. a young, politically powerful man befriends the young girl on a bridge. That fateful meeting changes her life forever. His respect for geishas as intimate companions demonstrates to her that a geisha is her path up the social ladder of the powerful, influential and well-connected. This revelation gives her new meaning in life for which she would be eternally grateful and, like a ship in rough seas to a solid beacon on land, deeply drawn to that stranger forever. In the turbulent world of staged advances and mock flirtation that can warm the hearts of clients, and break the hearts of others, there existed one genuine bond for one geisha and one man.",Memoirs of a Geisha
184,jannagal,The Geisha's memory is more complete in the book version.,8,29 December 2005,"Going into the theater I wanted very much that Memoirs of a Geisha would be a 10 out of 10. Maybe 8 of 10 is even a little generous, but I cannot understand how a number of raters give the movie a 1.Perhaps a person looking for action in the film would be disappointed, because there is very little action or adventure. Instead it is a very beautifully filmed movie with a nod toward the elegance of traditional Japanese culture.As a long-time student of Japanese language and culture, I looked forward to the movie. I was rewarded with a rich, non-stop kaleidoscope of pre-war Japan. Attention to detail is evident in every scene, whether costumes or make-up, or background scenery. This gorgeous movie should be a strong contender for awards in cinematography.All of the female leads were very beautiful and appealing, but it was irksome that all of the most beautiful geisha were portrayed by Chinese actresses. Okay, the film is not a history lesson, but it seems intuitive that a film so dedicated to iconography of Japan would have Japanese actors in the most iconographic roles.Another point,(maybe too picky, but yet irksome)involved the only action scene in the movie: a fight between the two rival geisha. It seems unlikely that one would deliberately throw oil lamps to spread a fire in the confines of the geisha house. Why? Because to do so could very well have burned down the entire city, since the dwellings were all constructed of wood and paper. In fact, several such disastrous fires have occurred in Japan's history.As is often the case, scenes from the book seem to be missing in the movie. Narrators in a dramatic film often indicate problems in the dialog that fail to convey a movie's message. Of course, in this film there is the device that it's a geisha recounting her memoirs. But in the book we have an idea of the whereabouts and current status of the story's geisha. That is missing in the movie.In conclusion, probably the general viewing audience in America will find the movie a bit long (2-1/2 hours), and dragging toward the end. They will be dissatified with the lack of action, and will find the characters at times difficult to understand (they speak in English with heavy accents). But if you want to watch a beautifully filmed movie, with a glimpse (albeit imperfect) into the elegance of traditional Japan, then you will enjoy this film immensely.",Memoirs of a Geisha
185,celinepu,Mysteriously beautiful,8,24 March 2021,"It is mysterious and I can feel the sadness due to choicelessness behind the conduct of a Geisha. I love the blue eyes and how beautiful the Japanese culture is through the depiction of women wearing kimonos and dancing. There was hardly a dull moment while watching this movie and I would not wanna skip any parts of it.However, I would appreciate it if the pronunciation and the subtitles are clearer, as I can only understand the whole story after reading the plot.",Memoirs of a Geisha
186,bousozoku,Sadly surprised,4,10 September 2006,"Recently, I finished reading this book. Even though much of it has been translated, the book has very precise, very detail imagery and emotional states. Being Japanese, I felt strongly about how the story was told.Seeing the film for the first time, it seemed thin. Someone else mentioned the scenery and it's magnificent. The streets were so wide, so unreal. The clothing was beautiful and seemed appropriate.Unfortunately, the story seems to be a poor backdrop for the scenery and clothing. It's not that the original story was poor, but it's almost been discarded in making something commercial that U.S. audiences might like.It's not even the Chinese and Korean actors, though I find it difficult to believe there were not enough Japanese actors available. Perhaps, they protested how un-Japanese the screen play turned out to be and refused to participate. I am saddened at how the main characters don't seem Japanese at all. Perhaps, the accents and faces count somewhat, but it's the mannerisms that show the difference.There were a few points where there was good chemistry between actors but for the most part, the film seemed held together with the imagery. Even though the words protested the role of geisha, the movie made them to be expensive prostitutes.",Memoirs of a Geisha

That said, I found this to be a simply amazing film! The casting was well-done (being of northern-European ancestry, the casting of a Chinese actress in the leading role admittedly didn't bother me), and I loved the historical aspect (I'm a period-piece freak), but to me the cinematography carried the film. I am so very pleased that it won the Oscar for that category. The use of color and shadow made for a visual delight. True eye-candy.I cannot recommend this film enough.

You feel transported to a time and place you have never before imagined. Colours and textures leap off the screen. It does an excellent job in clearing up western misconceptions of what a Geisha was, an artist rather than a courteasan. It does show you a whole secret world, which it has to be said is devoted entirely to the comfort and delight of men. It highlights the very limited choices available to Japanese women during this era. That aside, the images from this movie will stay with me for a very long time. I found the book heavy going and gave up after a few chapters, but think I will give it another chance after seeing this movie.I thought perhaps that it was a film that would appeal mainly to women, however my husband also sat glued to the screen during it. I think this is mainly because it is just so different from the usual Hollywood fare.",Memoirs of a Geisha
189,ajmelck,"A dreadful waste of time, talent and money",1,23 February 2009,"I've rarely been so bored or annoyed by a film. As visually ravishing as it is, it seems to pander to ridiculous Western notions of the East (Edward Said, where are you?), while completely failing to offer any kind of insight into the brutality and sheer nastiness of wartime Imperial Japan. I think it's indicative of the film's problems that so few Japanese were involved in its production: while the lead actresses are all very fine, they don't stand a chance in this thin, stereotypical piece of genre piffle. And if the Japanese kept away, who can be surprised? One look at the screenplay would discourage anything but the hardiest Thespians. Lawrence Olivier himself couldn't have saved a bad script, and even Gong Li, who I idolise, isn't able to do so here. What makes it even worse of course is the fact that the language is a free for all of poorly spoken English, in the genre of Nazi officers saying ""Ve vill kill ze English schweinehund venn ze sun rises!"" On the production side it's the same story: Americans all the way. No wonder that the Japan we are presented with looks more like Disneyland that the land of the rising sun. There's simply nothing to redeem this sorry tale. If ever there was an opposite to the sinewy elegance and sparse power of real Japanese film-making, this is it.",Memoirs of a Geisha
190,s_cadzow,Memoirs is well worth your time.,8,15 January 2006,"Memoirs is a film that can serve as a good example for what I see a lot of critics and the general theatre audience to be missing, and that is being able to separate literature from film. As delicate of an issue it may be, and I know first hand with Memoirs of a Geisha being my personal favourite novel, we as the film audience have to understand that the page and the reel are two very different mediums for art. What a novelist may bring to his book and what a director may bring to his film are very worthy of being discussed and compared on their own, but NOT to be the basis of a coherent and fair review of the individual mediums, especially film. That being said, only when you can come to understand that you are now watching Rob Marshall's Memoirs and not reading Arthur Golden's Memoirs, you can come to fully take in and appreciate Memoirs of a Geisha for whatever you are going to take it for.The story follows a very poor fisherman's daughter named Chiyo who along with her sister, get sold to separate geisha houses at a very young age. Chiyo is put into the Nitta house, where she is put into slavery until she can start her geisha training. In her slavery, she must withstand the wretched treatment of ""Mother"" and the wickedness of the houses head geisha Hatsumomo (Li Gong, Raise the Red Lantern.) Her only friend is another young slave turned geisha named Pumpkin. After a failed escape to try and be with her sister, and learning of her parents passing, Chiyo has little left. As fate would have it, Chiyo encounters a very handsome and polite chairman (Ken Watanabe) who buys her some sweet ice in exchange for a smile. The geisha, who are much more civil than Chiyo is familiar with that are accompanying the chairman make Chiyo determined to do whatever it takes to become a successful geisha in hopes that it will one day bring her back to the chairman's side. However, it won't be easy. After being taken under the guidance of top geisha Mameha (Michelle Yeoh) and changing her name to Sayuri, (enter Ziyi Zhang) she becomes the most successful geisha in Gion and Hatsumomo's biggest rival, leading Hatsumomo to use everything she can to destroy Sayuri, even Pumpkin. The first thing you are going to notice about Memoirs is the breathtaking beauty of everything on scene, every scene. The authenticity of the Gion District is what makes the films beauty so remarkable, seeing that almost the entire film was shot on a gigantic reconstructed set of Gion. The attention to detail is to say the least, admirable. As I watched the scenes go by, my stare of amazement for the aesthetics of the film did not once waiver. Also, about 5-10 minutes in Memoirs you are going to fall completely in love with the original score written by John Williams (Star Wars, Harry Potter.) As for the common attacks on the film version of Memoirs, The films pacing does seem a bit too fast at points, like it doesn't take time to fully appreciate its own beauty while trying to hit the plot points. Running at 145 minutes, Memoirs could have really benefited from an extra ½ hour, but I can see why Marshall would try to avoid the fear of boring the audience via Peter Jackson.Probably the biggest beef critics have with Memoirs that I cannot agree with is Chinese actresses are playing Japanese Geisha. Rob Marshall is not an idiot. Rob Marshall did not make Memoirs solely for film buffs or Americans practicing in Japanese enthusiasm. Rob Marshall made this film for the box office, and who can blame him. His cast is box office approved and viewer friendly and his cast is also extremely capable, speaking both English and Japanese in the film. While I can see how some may dislike this aspect of the film, I can hardly see it worthy enough to take the backlash many have given it. The acting is beautiful in many ways. Aside from the beautiful faces of the leading cast, every movement the geisha make has a purpose, and those purposes are carried out with extreme care and beauty. Ziyi Zhang continues to shine in Memoirs, every scene she is in your eyes are glued to her body as she bustles through Gion or as she throws herself down at the end of an exotic dance scene. Zhang's determination to make a life of her own in a world that is surrounded by lust, competition and ownership is very intriguing and well done. We believe her as she hurdles everything that stands between her and the only thing she has left in life.Now I know that it is going to be beyond impossible for every critic to leave the book behind, and everyone who reads this and every review of Memoirs of a Geisha will want to know how the two compare. Is the movie better than the book; is the book better than the movie? I will say that if you are looking for the detail in beauty that Golden gave us, it's all there in Marshall's Memoirs. If you are looking for the painful detail in every character that Golden gave us, then you may find Marshall's Memoirs lacking. You may not like the fast pacing of the film and you may be on the anti-Chinese bandwagon, but that is no reason to count Marshall's Memoirs out. With it's Oscar worthy set design, costume design, and original score, the film version of Memoirs of a Geisha is still the same story of love and beauty that brings so much with it to its rise to the big screen.",Memoirs of a Geisha
191,kctotal,Visually Stunning,9,25 March 2007,"""Memoirs of a Geisha"" had always been a difficult book to adapt. It is extremely rich in detail and so, a perfect adaptation would have been nearly impossible.until now! Rob Marshall creates an unforgettable world with an emotional core at the center, and splashed with colors and oriental culture. At the center of the plot is young Chiyo, who separated is from her poor family and sister, and is sold to a wealthy Geisha house. Envied by numerous others, in particular by Hatsumomo, the film follows her tragic path to become famous and to be finally in the arms of the man she had always loved. The selection of Chinese actresses for the roles caused a riot in China. They found it to be offensive and the film obviously was banned for release in China. A ""patriotic"" critic claimed Zhang Ziyi should be hacked to death. Fortunately, the cast was unmoved by these comments as they are the film's driving force. Zhang Ziyi portrays Sayuri with an innocence and silence which make it splendid. Her English is not fluent and this tends to become rather annoying. However Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh are fluent and this is a plus for their performance. Gong Li is impeccable as scheming geisha Hatsumomo. I was so amazed by her performance that I must state that she was literally robbed an Oscar nomination. It was simply stunning how she manages to BECOME the character. The way she walks, the way she sneers. It was perfect. Michelle Yeoh also triumphs as a famous Geisha turned into Sayuri's mentor. All the main characters were great  except for one. I am referring to Ken Wetanbe, with whom Sayuri falls in love with. His character is underdeveloped and it was a pity, since he was crucial to the sub plot.Unlike many other films, this film is special effects free, which was quite a change from the usual mainstream films. Instead the film's beauty is in its marvelous sets, which give the film an unashamedly touch of glamor  from the beautiful garden to the tea house which the Geisha's frequent. The dance before Sayuri's Dying Geisha Dance really piqued my interest. The dancers' co-ordination was incredible and the shocking pink which cut through the dark ambiance of the room was also admirable. Then there are the Geishas themselves. Each and every one has a different Kimono, and each one is unique. This is also an important factor of the movie's vast color palette. It is evident that there was lots of work into transforming the actresses into Geishas. Hours of make-up and daily sessions to learn how to walk, talk and act like a Geisha would. There were also English lessons for those who weren't fluent with the language. As always there are flaws. Gong LI's character gets kicked out of the story early, leaving it all on Zhang's shoulders. You may also consider subtitles for home viewing on DVD. Another thing I noted along the course of the movie was that the story was being shadowed by the film's beauty. Many say that in the director's quest for beauty, he left the story out in the rain. It is a pity since it was a good story which deserves to be developed further.VerdictIt's a good movie which deserves all respect. Minor flaws throughout, but the film is still sensationally beautiful and one of the best dramas of the year.",Memoirs of a Geisha

In this case: throw bunch of people all over Asia together in one movie and let them speak Tinglish.Let them all speak Japanese instead of different dialects of English which hurts performance. Americans should get used to subtitles for foreign movies. Native dialogue works best and most authentic.Slow movie with questionable message. We also don't really see much of the supposed Gheisha's skills. Knowledge, art, communication, not just be a pretty girl in a pretty dress acting politely.

193,davegering,Disappointing,6,10 July 2006,"When I was young, I saw ""The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea,"" and I remember thinking that the movie seemed more Asian than English in theme. Only later did I discover that it was actually written by Yukio Mishima, and was, indeed, purely Asian as originally conceived.Watching ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" last night, I was nagged by the opposite thought, i.e., that although this movie was set in Japan, it was thematically more aligned to the West. Even the geisha makeup seemed softened to western tastes, with the eyes and mouth accented in a very un-Japanese manner, and the amount of white face powder greatly reduced. Picture sort of a Noh version of a Charles Dickens story, or more appropriately, a Harlequin Romance.For make no doubt about it, this is a chick flick, containing catty women scheming against each other, improbable love triangles, women seeking inner fulfillment and wallowing in self-pity when their dreams appear to be out of reach, and just incidentally, a plot hole you could push a cow through sideways.Regarding this last comment (and here comes a spoiler), Sayuri is chagrined when Pumpkin brings the Chairman, rather than Nobu, to her dalliance with the American colonel. Since the Chairman and Nobu are partners, did she think the Chairman wouldn't hear about it from Nobu? In point of fact, Nobu certainly heard about it from some third party. So how did Sayuri think she could be appear a slut to Nobu while still remaining pure to the Chairman? It makes no sense at all, and appears to be merely a plot contrivance to get the characters where the screenwriter wants them for the even more improbable climax (which should have been omitted entirely).Adding to the problems is a pacing which just plods along. I found myself looking at my watch a number of times, wondering if anything would ever happen, or for that matter, if the movie would ever end.Why, then, do I give the movie six stars? Well, two are for the photography, which is superb throughout, and one is for John William's score, which while it is not terribly Japanese, is nevertheless effective. That leaves just three stars for the story.On balance, there are better ways to spend an evening.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Half way through, we realized we were missing a lot of dialog, so we returned to the top with subtitles on, and what a difference! Still, the themes of abandonment, child abuse, male dominance and sexual slavery overshadowed whatever merit the film had as art.

The use of colour is wonderful and if you can see it in HD to fully appreciate its beauty. It could be contrived by some as being slow and a little self indulgent. I can see this point of view. However you will get no such complaint from me. I could have watched this movie with the sound off and still loved it. Long panning camera shots, beautifully framed scenes are the norm. Even a journey from one building to another in a rain storm is spectacular. With lingering shots of water cascading down a tiled roof gently leading the eye to the young girl who appears from the top right.

197,geebeegb1,"Beautiful story, beautiful movie.",9,24 December 2005,"I knew very little about this story before seeing the movie. I have not read the book and only saw one preview that prompted me to see Memoirs.This is a touching movie that grabbed me from the first moment of the isolated, sad, and lonely house by the sea from which the lead character was sold. The expressions on the faces of Sayuri and her sister as they rode away brought tears to my eyes and those tears continued on and off throughout the movie.The acting was wonderful, the costumes exquisite, and the scenery alone was worth the price of admission. I am not Asian so I guess that is why I just don't get the uproar about the casting. I simply saw beautiful actors playing characters as they lived and changed.I will not take up time going through the scenes except to say most of them were gripping. I went through a lot of emotions watching this film and that is always an indication to me that the movie is great. I came away with a feeling of awe, satisfaction, and happiness.I am only saddened by the negative reception some are giving this movie. Even the theater I was in stuck this movie in the smallest room, way off the beaten path as if they assumed it would flop (or maybe were told to make sure it did??????).This is a fairly deep movie and does not spoon feed the audience. If you do not like a movie that makes you think, skip this one. However, if you like thought provoking movies with outstanding visual treats, make sure you see this before the critics make it go away.",Memoirs of a Geisha
198,evo8mr,absolutely breathtaking,10,11 December 2005,"Memoirs of a Geisha is directed by Rob Marshall (Chicago). This is one Breathtaking film. Everything about it so beautiful, and the way Rob Marshall captures the beauty of the Gion district in Japan makes the movie easier to watch, especially in the moments of true maturity.Zhang Ziyi stars as Sayuri Nitta, a woman who becomes the most celebrated geisha. But what Ziyi is doing is tricky, because throughout the earlier scenes in the movie it shows what she has gone through to become the person she is in the end. She bears all the hard work, pain and suffering she has gone through is shown through her actions and on top of that she is being driven by the kindness she was given by the Chairman (played by Ken Watanabe). We know she's bearing all her struggles and shows for it by lashing out. There hasn't been much praise about Ziyi's performance but not that many people realize how much of a complex character Sayuri is.Gong Li plays Hatsumomo, a bitchy type character in the vein of Judi Dench in Shakespeare in Love. You know her character is just brimming with disdain when she has her little pep talks with little Sayuri. When Li is on the screen, she just burns the screen with her embodying the bitch that Hatsumomo is. She steals every scene she is in. Then in the final moments that Li is in the movie, she lets up and has only ONE moment of introspection (people who are going to see this are going to realize what moment that is).Being a virgin to the novel by Arthur Golden, I felt maybe the movie will be a faithful adaptation to the book, and even not having read the book, I feel that it really is a VERY good adaptation.Being that this movie is Oscar bait, I think its safe to say that this will be nominated for some, at least for best actress in a leading role (Ziyi), best actress in a supporting role (Li), and best picture (Steven Spielberg, Lucy Fisher, Douglas Wick, producers). I don't know if Ziyi is a lock maybe because of Judi Dench in Mrs. Henderson Presents, and I also don't think that best picture is a lock because of Syriana and Munich.With all that said, I think this is shaping up to be one of the best movies of the year. 10/10.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Yes Memoirs of a Geisha is more lush than full, pretty than ripe with flavor, visual rather than grand.All that aside...this is a movie about Japan in this age, pure and simple. while reading the book I took away a knowledge of a subculture that I never fully understood (yet thought I did) and became more acquainted with something I never knew existed entirely. When I watched the film I came away not with an understanding of the Geisha (the book did that), but with an understanding of the era and time and place and so on with which the Geisha in the film exists. This is more like a companion piece to an indomitable novel than an adaptation of said novel. While the novel lets you into the world of the Geisha, this lets you into the world of the world of the Geisha, if that makes sense. And while I would rather have seen a tremendously faithful adaptation and subsequent transformation of the words into visage, I do admire that somehow such was not done and instead we see the full canvass for the first time, the story through words and the world through visual context. While I (again) would rather have seen the world fully realized, I admit that seeing it in this manor is no less grandiose.",Memoirs of a Geisha
201,dkar3,"Loved it!. In some ways, a lot like Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon",9,24 December 2005,"My wife and I loved this movie for many reasons.If you liked the beautiful scenes, drama, mystic, and love-story aspects of Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon, ...but maybe didn't care for the fantasy-like fight sequences, you will almost certainly like this movie. The movie is a blend of multiple, related stories, struggles and rivalries. The main story thread is about a young, beautiful, and unique girl sold into the world of the geisha. She struggles to find her sister, avoid the wrath of her new 'mother', and the rivalry of competing geisha apprentices. Eventually, she rejects the geisha lifestyle and is relegated to a simple servant for the others.*possible spoiler* While still a little girl and a servant, she meets a very kind, sophisticated man and promises herself she will become a geisha so be part of the world he lives in, and to save herself for him someday. All the complexities and challenges in her life cause this pursuit to be extremely difficult and it becomes the primary focus of the movie from its mid-point on.Although this is technically a love story, -- and I prefer ""guy movies"" to love stories anyday -- I still really enjoyed the movie. The acting, story, and cinematography are fantastic. And if you enjoy the Eastern cultures, you'll find the music, costumes, etc... to be an added benefit.Only one negative comment, which is that I don't have perfect hearing anymore and I had a hard time during 2 or 3 parts understanding what was being said, but this was not really much of a problem.I hope you give this movie a try because I think you'll definitely like it.-d",Memoirs of a Geisha
202,xiayun,A worthy big screen experience,8,17 December 2005,"Going into the film, I had worries with all the slamming critics have given, even though I didn't read all of them in details. However, I'm happy to say it turns out to be one of more satisfying movie experiences of the year.First I echo the sentiment that the film is simply technically perfect. The retro-mood it created had me immensed in the world of geisha from beginning to the end. It's very 1930 Shanghai like. The music score isn't as haunting as the one in CTHD, but it is still masterfully composed and fits in the background very well. It's worth seeing for the big screen experience alone. The story also never dragged, as each of the three parts flowed nicely. I normally don't like voice-over, but here it really held the movie together and helped to move the story along.As for the accents, the problem has definitely been exaggerated. I was expecting a lot of unpleasant broken English to be spoken, but they all sounded fine to good, not just from the most fluent Michelle Yeoh, but Ken Watanabe, Youki Kudoh (who plays Pumpkin) and other supporting casts. Gong Li had a few awkward lines at the beginning, and Ziyi had more and is the one who had to try the hardest, but both pulled off admirably and didn't hurt their performances in the process.Talking about performances, I think almost all of them did well. It's much more of an ensemble piece, and I was especially impressed by the young Sayuri and Ken Watanabe.The main problem I have is with character development. It is a Cinderella story at heart, but the good and evil are too clear-cut and lack dimension. I also want to see more ups and downs for the competition between Ziyi and Gong Li. Gong did all she could, but the script didn't allow her to be a worthy opponent. Except for some verbal back-and-forth between the two and a few dirty tricks from Gong, there was no reason to believe why she was the most famous geisha in Japan before Ziyi arrived.In addition, the Mother character is over-the-top and didn't fit the emotional aspect the film quite well, although she did provide some comical moments. The big dance scene had excellent buildup, but the execution of the dance felt flat. It lasted only about 30 seconds, while doubling that and making it more mesmerizing would have made the whole middle act more effective.These flaws didn't overshadow the fact that what was put on screen worked for me. Will I be willing to watch it again with friends? In a heartbeat. Will I recommend it to others? Definitely. With that in mind, I give the film an A-.",Memoirs of a Geisha
203,Kuroel,Exotic beauty under the rising sun,8,7 August 2006,"First of all I'd like to praise the film's cinematography; Japan looked astonishingly beautiful even with the more gruesome images of winter's coldness and the state of poverty at the time of the war.I think the actors performed well, but what annoys me is that when Hollywood moguls want to make a historical film about Japanese culture, they pick Chinese actors and make them speak the lines in English. In my opinion, it would have been better if the film had Japanese cast who'd have spoken in Japanese. After all, it is set in Japan. But what made the decision of using English, instead of Japanese, even more idiotic, were those tiny Japanese words like ""hai, arigatou, mite"" etc. which were randomly scattered here and there. They only managed to confuse. It was painfully obvious that not all of the actors were used to speaking English and the credibility of the movie wobbled. It's not pretty when some of the actors have to stutter their lines with immense difficulties. And besides, Japanese is such a beautiful language; why not use that.Further more, I enjoyed the film. One or two scenes more of chairman and Sayuri would have made me happier, but the end didn't disappoint.",Memoirs of a Geisha
204,WishfulDreamer,"Not as good as the book,yet spectacular.",10,17 February 2007,"I read the book first, then had to go see the movie (which coincidentally came out right after) when I was fifteen. It was a very good movie,with wonderful acting and sets. The choreography was amazing I loved how they tried to be realistic in the world of geisha. The effort put into this film was 100%. Some of the actors did not speak English true, but they did well enough. Gong Li was amazing despite not speaking English and though Zhang Ziyi is still learning, she did a marvelous job. The music- oh the music is so beautiful it can bring tears to your eyes. The only thing which disappointed me was missing some things from the book. Hatsumomo did not set fire to the okiya in the book, so my friends and I were shocked when that occurred because it was so different from the book's reason for Hatsumomo's demise. I understand why it was done, though, because Hatsumomo simply snapped in the book and that would have taken too long to unveil. The writers had to turn a 400 page book into a slightly over two hour movie- and they did a good job of it. See this movie- I highly recommend it and the book. Take a step into the world of the geisha- the breathtaking scenery and the harsh realities. You will not regret it.",Memoirs of a Geisha
205,alexandra-bolchi,It's a great movie and yes... It's a MOVIE,10,12 August 2021,"Many people here seem to be upset by the fact that non-japanese actresses have played japanese characters while being chinese. Well... Let me tell you something: none of you seem to mind when americans play english people and vice versa. So stop complaining because it's a MOVIE. Movies aren't supposed to make you feel like it's reality. Reality in movies is exaggerated, made more beautiful, thrilling and so on. Watch it, enjoy it and shut the hell up.

206,scifisuede,Simply gorgeous,9,26 March 2006,"This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. It is so visually dramatic that some frames look like paintings in glorious colours. I don't know much about Japanese culture, and I agree it's a shame that the language used is slightly-Chinese-accented-English, but the Chinese actresses did their performances brilliantly. I don't think their nationality really matters - it happens a lot that western actors have to play parts from other nationalities, but no one makes a fuss out of it! Another thing I like, that hasn't been mentioned much by others, is the love story. I've heard some people deem it unlikely, but I can totally understand how she feels. I'm a hopeless romantic myself and I always love films that celebrate the power of true love, something most people don't believe in anymore nowadays. It's sad to see how disposable 'love' is these days - you see people changing partners more often than they change hairstyles. You see people 'falling in love' with different people in a matter of months or weeks, and think it's perfectly natural. I wish there are more people who'd take love more seriously; I wish they'd understand how powerful love can be. Yes, a love like Chiyo's feeling is possible and yes, there are still people who'd do anything for that one true love.",Memoirs of a Geisha
207,zephyr24-1,Empty Geisha,7,21 January 2006,"The much-anticipated screen version of Arthur Golden's bestselling book opens with much hype. Casting three of Chinese cinema's darling, the film looks set to be a runaway success.The film opens with a young Chiyo being sent away to be a geisha. For the next half hour, the girl played by the delightfully wide-eyed 12-year-old Suzuka Ohgo suffers at the hand of big time geisha Hatsumomo played by the lustrous Gong Li. Besides the surreal cinematography, the stars of the film has got to be Suzuka Ohgo and Gong Li. By the time Ohgo's half-hour screen time is up, Gong Li has shown us how she embodies the character of Hatsumomo with aplomb- a woman full of vengeance, contrive and jealousy but with a yearning for love.When Zhang Ziyi's Sayuri appears as a grown woman mentored by Michelle Yeoh's Mameha, you can't help but feel that Zhang's thunder has all been stolen by Gong Li. Zhang can be seen as struggling with her English while trying to portray the vulnerable Sayori. While language has proved to be a stumbling block, Zhang's acting feels so distant that it leaves an empty feeling and provides no continuation from the warmth that Ohgo brought to the screen as a young Sayuri. Yeoh's mentor role is played nicely as it is - a steely woman who's determined to help her protégé beat arch rival Hatsumomo.In adapting the film for the big screen, screenwriter Robin Swicord has left out parts of the book that provides glimpses into the geisha world. Intricate details of how the kimono is worn and traits of a geisha are missing probably to shorten the already lengthy film.The aim and result is definitely style over substance. If anyone deserves an acting accolade, it should be Gong Li and not the overrated Zhang. (B-)",Memoirs of a Geisha
208,tthreadgill,Typical Hollywood misstep of bad research,3,10 January 2006,"Despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes. Where were the Japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants? Not on the payroll apparently. A Japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes. In a later conversation she said, ""Imagine a Finnish director making a movie in Fnnish about the American Civil War using blond Swedish actors as union Army and Frenchmen as the Confederates. Worse imagine dressing the Scarlet O'Hara female lead in a period hoop skirt missing the hoop and sporting a 1950's hairdo. Maybe some people in Finland might not realize that the hoop skirt was ""missing the hoop"" or recognize the bizarre Jane Mansfield hair, but in Atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears....and be laughing in the aisles...excellent story and photography be damned.So...watching Memoirs of a Geisha was painful for anyone familiar with Japanese cultural nuances, actual geisha or Japanese dress, and that was the topic of the movie! Hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making. They frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement embarrassingly wrong. I thought ""The Last Samurai"" was the crowning achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on Japan could be. Memoirs of a Geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time.",Memoirs of a Geisha
209,Jackie-Kennedy,A beautiful engaging and entertaining tale of a mysterious world,10,12 August 2006,"Having read Arthur Golden's wonderful book and thoroughly enjoying it I came to the film with an understandably high expectation of what was in store. I am pleased to say I wasn't let down in any way. Rob Marshall has succeeded in bringing a mysterious and beautiful world to life and telling a story we can all relate to; a struggle to live your own life while embracing the rules and regulations that go with it.To those who say a Chinese actress can't play a Japanese woman I say thats like suggesting Mel Gibson couldn't play a Scot or Cate Blanchett an Irish woman. Its absurd and untrue. Michelle, Ziyi and Li play three very different women but all put their hearts into it and it shows. I especially commend Li who cannot speak any English at all for her cruel yet very vulnerable Hatsumomo. She struck the right balance between the cruel selfish Geisha and the trapped lonely young woman underneath. Michelle's Mameha is every bit the mothering influence, the perfect Geisha, but she too has layers. She has a duty to do but she is woman and has feelings like everyone else. And then there's Ziyi; beautiful, accomplished and trapped a role she plays to perfection. Mother and Aunty are both hugely entertaining and very lovable.The male half of the cast complete the picture. Ken Wantanabe's Chairman is exactly what's you'd expect kind, loyal and of course very handsome. Nobu is played to a tee by Kochi just the right combination of hard exterior and soft sensitive heart. The Baron is hard cruel but you see too why Mameha likes him.The costumes are beautiful the scenery dazzles and the acting is superb. The story engages and captures you and picture draws you deep in to the Geisha's world. This a true masterpiece, a one of a kind movie.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Not without flaws, I still call this movie is a masterpiece. With age appropriateness in mind, all should see it. It is a window into a different time, and very different place for Westerners. The actors--and acting--is exceptional. The cinematography is magnificent. The music!--we are talking John Williams, Itzhak Perlman, and Yo-Yo Ma here!! The story, often in narration from what I assume is the book (I need to read it), is top notch. My only complaint--voiced by others as well--is that despite the excellent acting by some of the key players and best efforts to portray early 20th century Japan, the fact that they are not Japanese is unmistakable and a bit distracting. Nevertheless, my favorite performances here are from Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh, along with young Chiyo played by Suzuka Ohgo (who is Japanese). I say let the tiny flaws go and just enjoy this important film for what it is.",Memoirs of a Geisha
211,kevinalvarezp,A predictable Turkey!,1,1 May 2007,"A slow, tedious, and one dimensional movie! Good casting with clichéd dialogue, boring story line, and soulless direction from Mr Marshal! The conventional and predictable story of the most famous form of prostitution from the Asian continent, lacks heart, new insights, and depth. The lead character looks out of place due to her tiny phisique and phony looking contact lenses. The lexicon employed by the geishas sounds forced and a bit too sophisticated for their limited exposure in the ways of education. The story goes on and on for hours trying to convince you this little, boring, flat chested Asian girl is the ultimate Geisha, they actually say in the movie ""She is destined to become a legend"" i say hardy the case! The movie is just plain boring, it is beautiful to look at, it has a very few interesting moments as many as you may find by going out for cigarretes.

Give credit where credit is due!!! To ALL THE actors and actresses!! The story told was so moving, creative, and the detail a work of pure genius! I would like to address the negative comments: Firstly, there are only a handful of WWII Veterans left alive, and even fewer that were stationed in Japan. Do you know exactly how people thought? Acted? Another outstanding credit to Rob Marshall and staff! The research that went into the making of this beautiful film!! There have been several movies made about WWII...that have all WHITE actors...yet no credit given to the Black Soldiers...or Japanese Americans (100th Infantry Regiment).

Certainly there will be Oscar nominations for makeup, costume and cinematography.It is admittedly very long. It might be argued that there is not enough plot to sustain 2 hours and 18 minutes. But if you can resign yourself to sitting for 2+ hours, there is a lot to enjoy.Rob Marshall is really brilliant. He very nicely sets up and brings back motifs that add satisfying layers to the bare plot. The imagery is stupendous. Particularly, the image of red in the river while the voice-over talks about war is hard to forget.The ladies are all very good.

214,doozer333,"Pretty, but too light and fluffy to be taken seriously",6,18 April 2006,"Memoirs of a Geisha is certainly a gorgeous film to behold, and it deserves all of the awards it earned for those feats. There were scenes I found I wanted to freeze and hang on my wall. Unfortunately, the actual film isn't as rich as its imagery. It's entertaining, to be sure. But without the rich details the book provided, the whole thing seems somewhat frivolous. It almost plays like a particularly exotic nighttime soap.I do not fully understand the hubbub over the casting myself. The film certainly does not feel authentically Japanese and in fact, there are many scenes and touches that can almost be considered anachronistic. But I felt that in itself didn't detract from the film. As an American film-goer, I am quite used to people of different races playing people they are clearly not. I have witnessed too many bad accents to count, so I was not distracted by the un-Japanese-ness of it all. I am, however, not Japanese.That said, I think everyone does a fine job of bringing the characters to life, and I think specific mention should be given to Youki Kudoh in the thankless roll of Pumpkin. What keeps the film from being truly great is a distinct lack of grit and toughness. The film never really gives the impression that being a Geisha was all that bad. Whenever our heroine, Sayuri, runs up against what must be some of the considerable cons of the business, even she seems surprised. ""You mean there's a downside to this whole quasi-prostitute thing?"" The cleaned up Hollywood ending wants us to believe things are left bittersweet, but it really comes off just sweet. Like Pretty Woman in a kimono. The book had a melancholy grace that the film just lacks. Worth a rent if you've read the book, but if the movie hasn't yet piqued your interest, don't give it a second thought. You're not missing all that much.",Memoirs of a Geisha

If you know this in forehand, you might as well understand, why the characters are acting, how they are acting and that the young geisha's destiny not is a total misery or demise.Try to free your mind and set it free of the western preunderstanding... and eventually you will meet this movie with a bright new sight of view.

217,graphi,A stylized view of the orient,7,30 November 2008,"Memoirs of a Geisha was a bit of a disappointment for me. The music was undeniably beautiful. Many scenes were so breath-taking that I froze my DVD several times to take in their color and beauty. As for the costumes, they had an exotic charm. The plot was fairly interesting, too. However, the acting was shallow and one-dimensional, the dialogs were unnatural, and the actors were unconvincing. The fault lay in the fact that everyone involved on the other side of the camera (director, producer, costume designer, screenwriter, etc.) were westerners. As for the actors, many weren't Japanese, but obviously Chinese. I guess this was why everyone was speaking in accented English and not Japanese. This movie is a stylized, or perhaps even romanticized, view of Japan through the eyes of a westerner. It's another one of those Hollywood movies about other societies in which these societies are presented in a stereotypical way. Were I Japanese, I'd feel ambivalence about this movie.",Memoirs of a Geisha
218,bigtron,visually stunning movie,9,15 January 2006,"With all the negative reviews about the movie, i was very surprise on how much i enjoyed this movie. Its did not felt like a ""blockbuster"" formula movie where the story is sacrificed/altered to make way for a 2 hour commercial ala any movie ever made by Michael Bay (except Armageddon which somehow works!!). not to say the movie wasn't visually stunning. Its just the perfect blend to scenery, costumes and of course beautiful actresses. All except 1 scene where Zhang Ziyi's char threw away the chairman's handkerchief on top of a cliff, which seems a bit forced, just to have a shot of the beautiful cliff scene.As be the three actresses, Zhang ziyi keeps on surprising me with her acting and how much she has progress since ""Hidden Dragon Crouching Tiger"" (her movies lately have seen her taken on difficult roles and aced them perfectly. lets just forget she was ever in Rush Hour 2. That almost derailed her career as an serious actress. Only her language difficulties is holding her back. I have no difficulties understanding her or any other actresses. The only gripe i have is that they all talk with different accents and different levels of expertise. Michelle Yeoh was very polished to Gong Li broken English. And the kids all have American accents trying hard to fake an Asian accent. It a minor gripe and does not really bother me at all (except it seems to bother a lot of reviewers). Gong Li's char was suppose to be more sad but they made her out to be too evil and unsympathetic. Her true love was made out to be just a sexual fling and her sacrifice was made out to be nothing more than a inconvenience in the end, the scene where she was walking away after having lost everything she worked for, I did not even felt a bit sorry for her char.The movie flows very nicely (like a soap opera but squeezed into 2+ hours)I am glad they did not skip on the beginning and rush in the major stars (zhang ziyi and michelle yeoh) immediately. The girl who played the younger version was quite good which sets up the whole tempo for the movie (its just a bit weird that her English was better than zhang ziyi). Some complained that the movie is too westernized, geisha are not so open and daring. i am glad i am not so well verse in the Japanese geisha culture so i do not nik pick on those points. however they seems to be acting as though they are westernized (which then gives the problem of having to 'westernized' even more after the American arrived. The western stereotypes are just cringing and may put off some people. that is the only weak part of the movie.in the end a well done movie that did not get more audience because of the backlash of the 3 actresses background. i mean if mel Gibson can be a Scottish i don't see why these 3 fine actresses cannot be Japanese. i also felt that the broken English put off a lot of main audience (who wants to see a Japanese setting movie with actresses speaking in perfect American accents, with that hint of fake Japanese accent) In the end you get to feel how the character feels, her lost, her pain, her sacrifice and ultimately her joy. Definitely made me like zhang ziyi even more (after her sensational performance is 2046). definitely a must see and at the very least a DVD must buy.",Memoirs of a Geisha

If you've seen actual pictures of Geisha hairdos, they're nothing like the film versions, so minus a point or two for historical accuracy.But the thing that really makes me hate this film (and subtracts several million points) is that everyone treats it as if it was a documentary, when in reality this story is pure fiction. What this film needs is a disclaimer, ""The guy who wrote the book that this movie is based on had a cup of tea with a real geisha and then made a bunch of stuff up."" I would go so far as to call it slander. Geisha are not prostitutes as they claim in the movie and in the book. There are prostitutes in Japan, and sometimes those prostitutes do get their virginity auctioned off, but those people are not affiliated with the Geisha. I say, if you want to learn about the life of a Geisha, check out Mineko Iwasaki's autobiography, ""Geisha: A Life"" and stay away from this drivel.",Memoirs of a Geisha
220,se7en45,Sweeping visual feast that David Lean would envy.,8,20 January 2006,"It took over a decade for Arthur Golden to research and write about the secretive world of Japanese Geisha and there was no way a theatrical film could bring that level of detail to play. Still, this adaptation is miles ahead of Polanski's limp, pedestrian and pathetic OLIVER TWIST. This is an apt comparison since both films explore Dickensian ideals using melodrama as the vehicle to extrapolate their views.The film is set in the 1920's and is about how two tiny fisher sisters are sold by their poor parents to a geisha house. Once they arrive in the city, the elder girl is deemed too plain and is sold off to a common whorehouse in the derelict district whilst the younger, Sayuri, is retained as a servant in the high-class geisha house. The tale then follows the trials and tribulations as the younger sister grows up and becomes a rival of the leading geisha Hatsumomo. This rivalry will last for many years and create a division that will result in heartache and tragedy. The exploitation of young women is very disturbing and extremely harrowing (when the bidding starts for Sayuri's virginity your blood will freeze). The script dares to peep into the world of shadows and closed doors of the geisha.The movie has an absolutely ravishing palette and every scene is stunningly lit. The 2:35 scope is wonderfully majestic and evokes the floating world of the artist. From the opening scenes of the ocean and the windswept coastline to the candlelit interiors of the geisha houses to the cherry blossom in the countryside, all these vibrant vistas are visualized in the most seductive manner possible. There are many scenes where the interior of the houses are only witnessed though holes or cracks in the door. All these pools of wet darkness are superbly photographed and are very atmospheric indeed. If there is any justice at all then this film should sweep the Oscars in the cinematography and art design sections.The fashion department have pulled out all the stops to weave clothes that capture the imagination and send spasms down the spine. The kimonos that the geisha girls wear look lush and rigid, their colours bleed off the screen and their fine stitching is a work of art in itself. This exquisite detail is incredible.The music by John Williams, with Itzhak Perlman on violin and Yo-Yo Ma on cello, is emotionally gripping and has an epic charge to it that is beautifully married to the visuals. The main theme recurs in many different and subtle variations and when the film reaches the poignant climax it grabs your throat and leaves you aching. The end title theme is well worth staying behind for as the film ends and the audience leaves the theatre. Even now the epilogue music gives me goose-pimples.Now, much has been written about how Chinese actors were cast into the major Japanese roles. Many have felt that this was a travesty and tried to generate a boycott of the film. This is a grave injustice because the three main ladies are well cast and their roles are fleshed out with amazing performances. Zhang Yiyi, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh all have what it takes to bring life to their parts. Every tiny glance, subtle movement or twitch of the lips are caught by director Rob Marshall's team of committed professionals.The female roles are all well written and are three dimensional human beings. The men, on the other hand, are rather clichéd and are mostly portrayed as weak or manipulative deviants. The only one who generates our sympathy is the Chairman, played by Ken Watanabe, but his role as the romantic interest of Sayuri is drastically underwritten. It is as if the film has been shorn of a whole subtext to bring the running time to a cinema friendly 145 minutes. This is a shame because there are some interesting male characters that should have been given more breathing room to realize their characters more fully.However, despite these misgivings, the film is well worth trekking out to see on a large screen. This audio / visual feast is a rare treat and should not be missed. Another crucial note is that unlike Polanski's plodding and turgid version of OlIVER TWIST, which turns you off the source material, this film adaptation of MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA inspires you to snatch up the book for an immediate read.Recommended.",Memoirs of a Geisha
221,coolsharpharp,Decent film: Poor adaptation,5,25 February 2006,"Let me start by saying that I have read the novel before seeing the film and thoroughly enjoyed it. I had high expectations of the film and left the theatre with mixed feelings. The basic premise is that Chiyo (later to become Sayuri) is sold by her father to a Geisha house (Oikya). She tries to escape with her sister but is unsuccessful. She resigns herself to the life of a maid until she is befriended by a generous man called the Chairman. It is that moment that she forms the resolution to become a Geisha so that she may one day be able to repay his kindness. There are many obstacles in the way, none the least, Hatsumumo who lives in the same Oikya and hates Chiyo's guts.The film had the feeling of being too rushed and could have done with an extra half an hour. For example, at the beginning of the film Chiyo is whisked off to the Geisha house, without any exploration of her prior life. This robs the viewer of the juxtaposition of the carefree life she enjoyed in her small fishing village and the arduous and disciplined life she had to endure in the Oikya. It is oversights/errors like this one which made me feel that the characters were one dimensional when in fact they could have been rich and full of texture.While reading the novel I had the feel that I was looking through the keyhole of Sayuri's life. It almost felt like reading somebodies diary. The rushed nature of the film never allowed me to invest a great deal of interest in the characters or feel sympathy for them. This maybe due to the different nature of the mediums of film/novel, but the gap could have been bridged by a fuller exploration of the characters and not having to fit so much story in such a small amount of time.The film is not all bad. Those who have not read the novel will not realise the wasted potential and will therefore not judge this film so harshly. The cinematography is good, the performances are solid and the score is poignant. If I had watched this film without reading the novel I would have found the story engrossing. The exploration of the life of a Geisha is fascinating and the scenes involving Hatsumumo's tantrums are great to watch. I would recommend this film to those who have not read the novel but I would advise those who have to prepare themselves for disappointment. It's just a shame that such a great story has become another run of the mill Hollywood film rather than the classic it deserved to be.",Memoirs of a Geisha

223,REvans9092,Not one of Howard's best films,5,1 April 2006,"I didn't read the book so perhaps I was at a disadvantage is viewing this film. However, I found this film very convoluted and confusing...a real disappointment. Several hours of the film have very dark scenes...to the extent that many scenes are impossible to see! I didn't see any chemistry between the Chairman and the Geisha. On the positive side, the Japanese wardrobe and scenery is beautiful. I found the storyline interesting in that virginity is valued so highly in Japanese society that money is offered and the highest bidder wins. The Geisha is portrayed as a shy, retiring woman. How could she possibly interest any wealthy businessman...and get the highest bid? The rivalry between the women is disturbing and adds a harshness to the storyline. The romantic scenes are few and far between. I would have liked a little more romance! I will keep this film as part of my library, but I don't think I'll view it again. The ending is no surprise and somewhat fanciful. This film is a disappointing love story.",Memoirs of a Geisha
224,chiragkapadia2004,A Visual Masterpiece,7,2 January 2006,"Before one can say anything about the movie, it has to be said that this is 2 hours of non-stop visual delight.Scene after scene is laden with some stunning landscapes and cinematography that would make you gasp in awe and delight.And just when you have started breathing normally , you are bombarded by another heart stopping landscape.And no, I am not talking about the crazy and grand cinematography that , say LOTR had.This is much more mellowed, much more soothing and pleasant.Be it the endless succession of rooftops that young Sayuri sees from the roof, be it the strands of red cloth laid out against running water, be it the Chairman and Sayuri walking in grass and a gentle shower of pink blossoms from a nearby tree, it is as if the worlds most romantic poet crafted and created each and every scene from that corner of his heart which ached the most.And that alone makes this movie worth a watch.Faced with extreme poverty, Sayuri's father , a fisherman , sells off his 2 daughters to get money for his sick wife.The two sisters are separated, and Sayuri ends up at the mercy of Hatsumomo, a cruel and heartless geisha.And because of her ,she ends up being a slave , destined to pay off her debts through years of service.However, an encounter with a kind man(The Chairman) makes Sayuri yearn to be a geisha so that she can finally end up with him again.Enter Mameha, the rival of Hatsumomo, who takes Sayuri under her tutelage and transforms her into the most sought after geisha in that part of the world.Things take a turn for worse unfortunately with war, and Sayuri is reduced to just another worker, the magical art of Geisha being long lost.However, she is called back to help the Chairman get through a deal with the Americans.Will she be able to express her love to the Chairman? or will it get lost in the hard world of geisha, where ,as Mameha put it,""We do not become geisha to pursue our own destinies.""The plot moves along at a languid, unhurried pace, which is just right for the content.Ziyi Zhang is perfect as the mesmerizing Sayuri(boy, she IS mesmerizing.the deep green eyes of her...), and so is Ken Watanabe as the Chairman.The one drawback is initially it does take time to start gathering steam and converge into an engaging story line, and you want to scream, ""Ok! Got it!Now can we move ahead PLEASE??""Overall however, I would say that it definitely does deserve a look.Personally?One of the best movies of the year.",Memoirs of a Geisha

But that's all it seemed to me, somebody trying to portray an imagined Japan.What infuriates me, is that they have to find 3 Chinese actresses to play the 3 main female roles, in a film featuring a culture so uniquely Japanese. This film totally disrespects Japanese culture and even get praised for its misrepresentations!As a person who have much experience with both Chinese and Japanese cultures, it is very clear that Zhang Ziyi is miscast, and while Michelle Yeoh seems to have tried to make an effort to act like a Japanese, her efforts were mostly a faliure. Their Chinese accents are obvious and thus ruined the whole film, as if the film couldn't be more disrespectful.Little Chiyo, played by Suzuka Ohgo, is spectacular and really brings viewers into the world of Geishas, but she can only do so much, when so much other things are wrong.Watch Japanese-produced films about historical Japan please, many of them are so underrated.",Memoirs of a Geisha

The movie is based on a book and the writer of the book (based on the interview with Mineko Iwasaki) misunderstood the whole thing. Geishas are represented literally like whores (which is not true). And then people think of geishas like that. That is the problem.

227,ShawnM1,Had most of the ingredients to be great...,4,2 October 2006,"I didn't read the book. I didn't have to in order to anticipate a great story. The subject matter of this film should have made it a pretty intriguing tale that kept me on the edge of my seat. Instead, I found several holes in the story and too many unanswered questions.I didn't grow especially attached to the characters. The casting felt wrong. Rather than feeling sadness or outrage at the characters' circumstances, I felt vague annoyance at being exposed to their vulgar suffering.I didn't know that the actors were Chinese when I watched the movie, yet I was left with a distinct feeling that the film had many Chinese elements that did not belong. I also had a very hard time understanding some important dialog in the movie.Like most American films, this movie had great visual style, astounding beauty, but when it comes right down to it, the movie had no soul. It lacked the acute sorrow one commonly finds in this flavor of film. When a film accomplishes the beautiful imagery, has a fantastic setting and budget to work with, yet still fails, I am even more disappointed. I would definitely not wish to watch the film again.",Memoirs of a Geisha
228,imanib-36810,"The Book Had Potential, But...",3,4 September 2021,"Gong Li is the only reason I rewatch this film ahaha. It did not deserve any awards, let me be honest. The fact that it got Academy Awards just goes to show how stupid that award show is. Gong Li as Hatsumomo though, should have got an award. I won't lie. Anyway, the film itself is bland. The romance they want you to believe in is literally a tale of grooming and predatory behavior. But even if we were to take that out the window, the Chairman and Chiyo's actors have zero chemistry. So, there's no passion. Also, let's not forget that they cast mostly Chinese actors to play Japanese characters. And the worst part about the film: that they speak broken English throughout the entire film which makes no sense. It just has ""written by USA"" all over it haha. I won't lie...the book is actually good though. The writing is makes it very easy to get invested into this woman's story. So, I can see why they tried to make it into a movie, I guess. But they just didn't do it in the right way. Well, maybe in the age of Hollywood remakes they'll put this one on the list. And we can get a Japanese American or Asian American filmmaker to make it this time around. But seeing as though the book is written by a white man anyway, maybe this story is one that is better off having been made in the inauthentic the way that it was.",Memoirs of a Geisha

From the very start this movie grips you with a strong opening scene an it only gets more intense from there on. You see the the cruelty of how her life was when she was a girl in the geisha house, you see how she desperately tries to fight but also you see how she accepts her destiny only to saver her own heart. This movie is very sad at times and it's packed with a lot of emotion. funny instances also are a good relief in this movie, but overall you just feel so much for this character that is Sayuri, a lovely girl thrown into the cruelness of reality who held on to her hope for many years until it was time to let go, at the right time.",Memoirs of a Geisha
231,Napoleonforever,Cinematography leads the way for outstanding movie,10,30 October 2006,"and the ultimate purpose of creating a movie is: ENTERTAINMENT. And this movie did entertain me, and held my attention from the first exquisite image to the end. The acting and casting was superb, and way too much was made out of the Chinese Actresses playing Japanese parts; as I am unfamiliar with ANY of the cast here it gave me the true chance of measuring their performances with complete objectivity. Again, outstanding is the word to describe the acting.The background for the time-lines were depicted accurately, and a lot of hard work had to be put into this movie. Other things that I relished about this movie: 1) very few special effects; 2) no car crashes/explosions; 3) no graphic sexual activity; 4) no excessive profanity, and hard to recall any at all. May not be any profanity. 5) Story content was something I had not seen before, and done with taste and class. Not the ""cookie-cutter"" formula the Hollywood machine continues to wring profits out of the ""dumbed-down"" American audiences.This great movie only won 3 Oscars and a few other awards.

232,rbirge-1,Memoirs of Another Kind,10,26 October 2006,"How is it possible that some people love this movie and others hate it? Those that do not like it cannot feel the acting is not first rate, because it is. The music is superb and the cinematography breathtaking. I realize that using three Chinese actors in a Japanese film was not politically correct, but who cares. The movie is so well done that it should be considered a classic, and probably will be when the smoke clears.The term ""memoirs of another kind"" was taken from the movie, and I used it to emphasize that this is not the story of a powerful person who achieves greatness and has impact on the world. It is another kind- of a person whose fate is carried by the currents of tradition and honor, and about a love that is powerful enough to survive against odds that are both the story and the tragedy of this film. To those who say that this is a film only a woman could enjoy, there is enough pride, deceit and cruelty to please any man who likes a good horror story. That a human spirit is not trampled in the process is what makes this a great story, and that the movie provides a stunningly accurate mirror of the book is the reason this male gave this a ten. It is a classic and a must see. It will stay with you for days, and give you both hope for the human condition and resignation that humans are seriously flawed.",Memoirs of a Geisha
233,manel-minny,Interesting take on the horror of being a girl in Japan,8,16 February 2019,"The film was shot well ,,great music to set the seen and a beautiful backdrop of early 1900s Japan.Now for the horror part her parents sold the geisha house without a word.The girl are treated as robots that fulfil mens desires without going to far.The shear disgust in selling your virginity to apparently elevate you to a full geisha standing. Which clearly turns the young girls involved cold and dead inside. As can be seen from Gong Li's character. So sad and angry at her life she became cruel .And i cannot blame her.Also the beautiful lie which i enjoyed seeing the ""training"" of young girls to become elite feminine machines.Indicating it not innate in young girls to behave that way its a performance. so what is considered feminine IS a LIE everywhere.Not just in the west. In Asia also it is drummed and taught rather than it being nature.Lie after Lie ...until women wear these masks in general like a brainwashed cult member.But apart from that its all sad. No real skills sets just looking for the right man to take you away from all of this.SHAME",Memoirs of a Geisha
234,oneshortkat,I liked it.,8,6 January 2006,"I read a lot of the review on here saying that this was a pretty bad movie but I have to disagree. I thought is was beautifully filmed and had a great storyline. But then again, many of the complaints were from people who had read the book and I haven't read the book yet. I thought that the actresses were terrific, especially Zhy Zhang(sp?) and the women who played her mentor and her enemy were awesome as well. The scenery and costumes were all beautiful and the music, be still my heart, was absolutely gorgeous. I bought the score as soon as possible after seeing the movie. I did have a few problems with the movie though. I thought that the movie should have had subtitles because some of the women seemed to be having trouble speaking in English and it was hard to understand what they were saying. Also the movie dragged a little at the beginning, they could have cut out a few of the scenes. But other than that I thought it was a beautiful movie with awesome acting.",Memoirs of a Geisha
235,sebrat,Why all the cynicism?,10,11 February 2006,"Having read the book shortly after watching the movie, I was quite amazed at the comments I've found everywhere - it is very true to the book and it seems quite pointless to complain about trivial goofs. In my opinion, the story itself is the most important part of the movie. It was wonderfully bittersweet and deserves far more recognition than it is currently receiving.Seeing as all of the reviews I've read (not just on this website) have provided no reason for their hating it, I will provide my reasons for thinking that it is the best movie of the Oscar year. Firstly, the acting was simply superb, especially well-selected child actors. Secondly, the Oscar-worthy and -nominated soundtrack especially the cello-playing by Yo-Yo Ma. Thirdly, the trueness to the story while still remaining an original film was just brilliant. Fourthly, the costumes looked just brilliant as was the Geisha makeup, all very authentic.The film gained the position of #20 on my very exclusive top 50 movies, up there with other Oscar nominees and gorgeous movies. I was also quite surprised that Stephen Spielberg had produced it so well - he tends to either get it very right or very wrong and this movie was certainly the former. Enjoyable to watch and fantastic performances culminated in this superb production. I most definitely think that it should be a top 250.Memoirs of a Geisha was one of this year's sharper knives in the drawer and it deserves every success. I just wish that people would see what a beautiful production it is and why it's not racist or full of 'subtitle fear'. I can think of many films which do not use subtitles (eg The Pianist, which uses little bits of Polish and German to set the scene as per this film). It's not often that you see one of these period films which is both an educational insight and a stunning story. It was just a gorgeous, enjoyable film.",Memoirs of a Geisha
236,keithmp,By popular request.,8,18 July 2006,"To be honest, being more or less given a free rein to book the films at Coalville's Century Theatre, I wasn't too keen to show this film as I had the impression it was artistically beautiful but very lightweight in plot for its considerable running time. Also, I usually only have two Century Cinema evenings per month and there appeared to be no advance notice of the film being released to the Non-Theatrical circuit. However, after a recent Friday film night, a lady approached me and politely enquired if I had plans to show Memoirs Of A Geisha. I said I thought not, as it looked like it wasn't going to be coming up for bookings on our circuit. The lady was obviously disappointed and I couldn't help wondering what had happened to this film, which was now available for public purchase or rental for home viewing. On the following Monday, I contacted the Non-Theatrical Distributors to enquire about this film and was told its release had been held up by a dispute over film rights, but this had now been cleared up and the film would be available within days. By now I'd 'tested the water' by asking Century regulars if they'd be interested in viewing the film and there was obviously significant interest, so I immediately fixed up a booking to show 'Geisha' at the next free date. I have to say I personally found the film very engrossing and not lightweight at all! A very engaging storyline (I've not read Arthur Golden's novel), brilliant set designs, and, to me, excellent acting performances/characterisations from the leading actresses, with a very appealing performance by Suzuka Ohga as the young Chiyo. At times I seemed to miss out on pieces of dialogue from these actresses and put it down to my state of hearing at 58 years, but I've since noted this has been a 'problem' to previous reviewers and it certainly didn't impair my following the storyline. Our local press film reviewer (who is actually very fair and informative) commented, ""Disappointingly, the central love story never takes flight"". But this was fundamentally pivotal to the plot development...Chiyo/Sayuri had only one love interest in her life, which she never gave up. I personally thought it was a delightful 'love story', with a very satisfying ending as Suriya finally understands the mysterious circumstances of Mameha's training of her to become such an elegant and accomplished geisha. I also felt the music soundtrack was perfect for the film and I loved the ongoing narrative, which added to the 'Japanese' feel. And yet almost all the film was shot around LA...nice work by director Rob Marshall, and a worthy winner of three Oscars. As our audience left, after the screening, everyone seemed to be in good spirits, and one gentleman of mature years commented (with a smile), ""That was different"". I agreed. The charming lady who'd set the ball rolling by first requesting the film, came up and added her personal thanks, she'd certainly enjoyed it. In turn, I thanked her...it's been our most successful film of the Summer so far. Incidentally, I can understand the problem of film rights as according to the opening credits there were five production companies involved in the making of this romantic epic.",Memoirs of a Geisha
237,twim23,Strip Tease...Geisha Style,6,9 December 2005,"THIS MOVIE LOOKS SOOOOO AMAZING...but the amazement stops there.The film is cloaked in perfect cinematography, a beautiful score, and the wonder of the whole ""Geisha"" world. Yet, there's no significant story in that cloak. Just a beautifully packaged Oscar nom.I, personally, stopped feeling any connection with the main character after the 1st act. You're sent into a journey on this dark and ""forbidden world,"" and at the end of the movie, you'll be asking yourself why you stayed for the whole 2 1/2 hour journey? The stakes are never high enough for Siyuri, so there's never a satisfying resolve. The whole film is just long and...pretty.The characters are one-dimensional and most of the so-called ""Japanese"" actors, are really Chinese. It would be nice if Hollywood learned the difference one of these days. Normally, I wouldn't make such a big deal about this, but this is such a Japanese story. I wonder how the film will be received in Japan? The performances are solid, especially by Li Gong (aka Gong Li). Look out for her. She's been acting for a while, but I think you'll see a lot more of her in the States.Ultimately, the film is like a strip tease. The visuals will excite the hell out of you, but like a stripper, it doesn't give you much substance to go along with the good looks.",Memoirs of a Geisha
238,Apprenti,"Seriously mediocre, there are better ones of this type out there",5,14 May 2007,"I suspect that people who raved a lot about ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" as a masterpiece, a classic, best movie of the year (if not ""in the world"" or ""of all time""), etc., do not watch much  if any at all  authentic Japanese films or Chinese films. It has more to do with one's repertoire of movie viewing than one's national or cultural identity. Sure, the latter succeeded in fanning controversy  Chinese playing Japanese and whatnots - but ultimately was not a significant factor in its box-office or critical reception.""Geisha"" has Hollywood A-list production qualities written all over it but - not surprisingly  lacks in direction and creative writing. ""Amateurish"" best describes director Rob Marshall's efforts. Nothing he did in his only other screen effort  the Oscar-winning ""Chicago"" - prepares him for something of this scope: a story set in a culture he's wholly unfamiliar with, and without any musical or dance numbers. ""Chicago"" and ""Geisha"" are not alike. Not even by a long shot. He's at his element when it comes to musicals, being his specialty. He is brilliant with ""Chicago"" but fails with ""Geisha"". In ""Geisha"", he's a fish out of water. Let me count the ways.One: rare use of establishing shots. This is fine for ""Chicago"", since it's a musical. It isn't really about the title city and people know enough about Chicago to not require establishing shots to be informed. But for a period piece set in a place largely unfamiliar to most audiences, establishing shots are necessary to give the story the sense of time, location, purpose and scope of the protagonist's world. Without it, it would be like watching a daytime soap opera.Two: too many close-ups. They do nothing more than make the lead actors' acting seem more important, even though they don't reveal any more facial or subject information had medium shots been used instead. Judging by the storyboarding, it appears that the camera is just passively recording everything that's written on script  also very common in daytime soaps. There is no sense of vision or imagination in creating a visual language. Which goes into the next point.Three: a director that doesn't have his own direction. If the best concept a filmmaker can come up with is the 'Cinderella' story  typical Hollywood cliché - then he's not much of a director. Even a truly good director can build on that or bring a different take to it. Not Marshall. He takes the source material and structures it around the fairy-tale motif. Simply put, the script is the naked body; 'Cinderella' is the costume it wears. Sayuri (Zhang Ziyi) is Cinderella, 'Mother' Kaori Momoi and 'Auntie' Tsai Chin are a pair of Evil Stepmothers, Hatsumomo (Gong Li) is the Evil Queen, Mameha (Michelle Yeoh) is the Fairy Godmother, Pumpkin is the Selfish Stepsister, and The Chairman is Prince Charming (Ken Watanabe). The story runs page-for-page like the 'Cinderella' tale, save for a clothing fabric substituting for a glass slipper. In this situation, imitation is not the sincerest form of flattery. It is a indication of a lack of an original idea.Four: erratic jump cuts. Marshall uses plenty of jump cuts in the first 20 minutes, and then doesn't use them anymore. Was it just to call attention to itself (to impress viewers of his ability to do jump cuts)? I believe the first 20 minutes be done (by a more experienced director with a real vision) better without those jump cuts.Five: similarly erratic pacing. The overall pacing is a rough and bumpy fast-slow-fast-slow rhythm. The 'slow' parts, most of which are in the final hour of the movie, drag excruciatingly. With the decreased pacing, Marshall does not even make any effort to build or develop the drama. All he does is slow it down.Notice I made no mention about the acting. Didn't have to. The film has enough shortcomings without bringing acting into it. Furthermore, it wasn't the actors' fault. When you put an inexperienced, ungifted director at the helm, you're going to get mediocrity. ""Geisha"" could have been a better movie had someone else done it.""Geisha"" is not that good of a film, let alone that good of a film about Asians, their story and their culture. Because there are so many better ones out there. From Japan, there's Akira Kurosawa (""Seven Samurai"" for instance, though every one of his films is a true masterpiece), Shohei Imamura (""Black Rain"", ""The Eel""), Masayuki Suo (""Shall We Dance?"") and Beat Takeshi (""Zatoichi"", ""Battle Royale"", ""Blood & Bones""), just to name a few. From Chinese-speaking nations, there's Zhang Yimou (""Raise the Red Lantern"", ""Hero""), Ang Lee (""Eat Drink Man Woman"", ""The Wedding Banquet"") and Chen Kaige (""Farewell My Concubine"", ""Temptress Moon""), again to name a few. Even some of Steven Chow's earlier comedy flicks can blow ""Geisha"" out of the water.Seriously, go check them out. Then come back and say if ""Geisha"" deserves all the praises you initially gave it. However, if your taste in movies is too conditioned in Hollywood junk, forget it. The above-mentioned will probably bore you.I suppose as long as ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is the only movie you'll ever watch about Asians, their story and their culture, it'll always be a masterpiece to you.",Memoirs of a Geisha
239,The_StarWolf,"Steven, Steven, Steven ... how could you?",3,14 September 2007,"In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, Stephen Spielberg twisted German manufacturer Porsche's arm into having them dig up WWII blueprints so they could build him authentic German tanks for the film.This makes all the more incomprehensible how he could lend his name to MEMOIRS.Those who point out the lead was Chinese and LOOKED/FELT Chinese were quite right. She's a fine actress, but she's not Japanese and when your central character is supposed to be that's Not A Good Thing. 129 million Japanese and they couldn't find ONE actress suitable for the role? Did they even look? What were the costume designers thinking of? Lady I know who is licensed to teach the making and wearing of kimono in Japan was wincing visibly at some of the design goofs. Even *I* could spot them. This is not typical of Spielberg's attention to details.The main dance number? My God! That was right out of a 70's disco. Whatever possessed the drugged-out choreographers to come up with that? It was painful to watch.****************Spoiler?************** They quite correctly state that Geishas are not prostitutes and it's not about sex.OK. So why the heck do they then spend all that time going on about selling her virginity as though it WAS about sex???****************Spoiler Ends************** There were some wonderful touches, to be sure. One seasonal transition scene stands out as one of the all-time best I've witnessed, for example. And I agree there were some lovely visuals, though bad focus rendered many not nearly as effective as they might have been. (Perhaps a projector problem?) But the main character just didn't 'feel' right, and there were enough other things just plain wrong with it all that, given Spielberg's name on it even as just producer(?), it really should have been better and doesn't merit more than a charitable '3'.

240,charlie_bucket,"Glad I didn't read the book, because the movie is lovely",10,2 February 2006,"After reading so many reviews by people whose experiences with this beautiful movie were ruined because of the dreaded book-to-film curse, I can only thank my better senses for not having read it, although that is now in the works. I am beginning to think that it would be wise to go to cinematic book adaptations armed with complete ignorance of the source these days. Such a strategy may have allowed me to enjoy the filmed version of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, for example, but as is, it was just another unbelievably corny and overwrought, over-scored special effects-laden massacre of an otherwise damned good set of books.In my ignorance of the source, 'Memoirs of a Geisha' turns out to be lovely if a bit contrived, and I am glad I allowed myself to enjoy it without niggling over the fact that there were Chinese actors playing Japanese roles or that it was filmed in California or that this or that part of the book was left out or abridged. The most important thing with 'Memoirs' is that it restored in me some hope that Hollywood is still capable of immense beauty and taste. It seems to me that this movie achieved an aesthetic at times that was unprecedented and astounding in its bare beauty, something even the film's detractors are willing to admit just before they throw the baby out with the bathwater.Ziyi Zhang accomplished for this reviewer exactly what her character was supposed to accomplish with the men in the story - she forced me to ""fall in love with her"" about 12 times over throughout the movie, with her solo dance scene sending a warm current up my spine in particular. She is indeed a moving work of art in this: Sensual, beautiful, graceful, and young. That her acting is not particularly kaleidoscopic here makes many feel that she is a 'cold fish', but I saw nothing to corroborate this opinion, nor did I see any scenes where her character needed anything more or anything less than what she provided. I found her performance to be very honest in scope - even award-worthy compared to Oscar-nominee hacks like Reese Witherspoon. Zhang is exquisite in every moment, and her sad, demure beauty and understated performance work perfectly with the tremendous restraint that the subject is showing throughout. I found her work here very touching.My largest reservation about this film is post-viewing, upon coming here and looking at the IMDb voter history, only to discover that the demographic that rated 'Memoirs' as highly as I do seems to have been composed of girls under 18 years of age! This is probably the very last group of people whose collective movie opinion I would want to associate myself with, but there it is.I suppose the second thing I didn't like is that the movie had a bit too much Cinderella element to it, though dirtied up to accommodate the 20th and 21st-century decayed moral flavor. The chairman character was practically anemic in terms of being fleshed out as anything more than a bit player, just like Prince Charming always was, and made the protagonist's doings and goings-on a little bit too much like a protracted teenage crush to truly take seriously, but I can forgive this in light of the film's other charms.Otherwise, I felt that this one worked on all levels - particularly visually - but with a special nod to both Li Gong for her outstanding portrayal of the antagonist, and to John Williams's excellent musical score. He is the only symphonic composer in the industry today who really has the spark, I think. The rest of them might as well be composing adventure music for those awful Marine recruitment ads with the buff dunderheads combating fire-breathing monsters.",Memoirs of a Geisha
241,sneakysnacks,Beautiful... do not listen to the critics,10,27 August 2011,"This is one of the most amazingly beautifully shot films in history. The cinematography is hands down the greatest that I have ever seen. You will feel so engrossed in the film as to in parts question whether or not this is a film or whether you are in the streets of Kyoto. Not only is there superb acting and plot, the costumes and settings are equally fantastic. This is one of the few films that has made me cry. You feel a deep connection to the characters and are filled with anticipation to see how their lives end up. Do NOT listen to those who say this film is culturally in-sensitive, they are just looking for a reason to complain. Honestly I know a fair bit about Japanese culture and it is tough to get much more realistic than this and still appeal to the masses. Of course there are inaccuracies, this is a film not a documentary on pre-war Japan. An amazing journey that cannot be missed!",Memoirs of a Geisha
242,cory_j_adams,Very Entertaining but not Accurate,9,23 February 2011,"When I first saw Memoirs of a Geisha I didn't know what to expect. From the trailer I saw a very interesting movie which it was, but it was also completely inaccurate.Arthur Golden's novel tells the story of a young girl in 1920's Japan who is sold to a geisha house as a servant girl. As the novel progresses, we see how she achieved her goal of becoming a geisha. The novel depicts geisha as women who sell themselves for an extremely high price, but in actuality geisha are merely entertainers; However, there is a recorded period during the Great Depression where geisha had to go to such measures to earn money.Although, I have to say that Rob Marshall's depiction of this novel is very well done. There may be some parts here and there that are not part of the novel but it is very entertaining. I don't think anyone in the film industry could have directed like he did. The film's appearance was also very amazing. Dion Beebe's cinematography, John Myhre's sets, Colleen Atwood's costume designs, and, above all, John Williams' excellent score make this film as exotic as the country its based in.The film received six Academy Award nominations, winning three for Beebe, Atwood, and Myhre. I personally think that the film should have received more recognition including a Best Picture nomination. I also think that Gong Li should have gotten a nomination for Best Supporting Actress because her performance was by far the most outstanding.Memoirs of a Geisha may be inaccurate but I think it is one of the best films of 2005.",Memoirs of a Geisha
243,bersarhin,Great production design...interesting adaption,6,12 March 2006,"Well, I will start with the production design. 10/10!!!! This movie won 3 Oscars: The one for Best Costume Design was obvious. The costumes of this film are impressive. They are beautiful. It also won Best Art Direction. I didn't agree with that one. Yes, the sets were beautiful but I personally liked the ARt Direction of King Kong and Good Night, and Good Luck better. Then, Best Cinematography. I found this picture to have an AMAZING cinematography, the problem is that Brockeback Mountain was not just AMAZING in its cinematography, but Perfect. Still, this film has a great production design. It is captivating, almost mesmerizing. The costumes, music, sound, art direction, make-up and cinematography are incredible.I have not read the book, that way I can study the storyline better without complaining that half of the book is gone. Perhaps the book was altered a lot on its way to become a motion picture, but this movie (unlike many other films based in books) has a correct narrative. Even if half of it is invented, it isn't just small bits of the book but a correct storyline with a beginning, a middle and a conclusion. To quote some pictures that do not have a correct storyline and are just bits of the book:Harry Potter Series Movies 1, 2 and 4. - Bridget Jones's Diary 1 and 2. - Charlie's Angles: Full Throttle (I know it's not based in a book but it's the perfect example of a movie with no storyline or argument and is just bits and pieces).",Memoirs of a Geisha
244,the_yellow_brick_road,Great art..but not great film,5,9 June 2007,"I saw this movie on DVD with little background knowledge or preconceptions other than that it was based on a book, of which I had read 3 pages, and that there was a lot of contention over the casting of Chinese actresses in Japanese roles etc. but not having actually read/ heard of it personally. I was aware it had won Oscars for being visually very artistic and beautiful, so I prepared myself by sitting quite close to the TV (which as I soon discovered was also beneficial for trying to understand what was being said). I will not do a blow by blow of each scene, but I have to say that I do not think the opening scenes were as perfectly 'honed' and crafted as much of the remaining movie was. The opening should grab you and really give you a sense of where the movie is going, if not in plot then in style and direction, and I really don't think that those scenes captured that at all. On to a general overview! You've heard it all before- the film is beautifully shot, every frame could be a work of art, gorgeous stylistic devices- costume, set, cinematography, soundtrack yada yada yada. In each scene they all work to create a beautiful harmony (except the opening ones). This all makes for great ART yes, it's true. But as film- well, the same excellence is slightly lacking; and given that this in fact a movie and not art, I feel that it is really not up to standard in the aspects that really should be in a production of this calibre and budget.A film is about telling a story, and telling it well. Costume, set, score etc. are all very important BUT they are in fact secondary to the plot, sequencing, dialogue, screenplay etc. which are the actual vehicle for the movie. Of course they can be as important, and a great film should have equally good design/substance- but they must not, and this is where 'Memoir's' falls short, take precedence, these alone cannot carry a film. To put it very crudely, basically it's like wrapping up your average tie/socks/hankies in really great wrapping paper with lots of ribbon and glitter and a great card for Christmas- sure it looks really nice, but once all the pretty stuff is taken away, it's just...socks. What really got me plot-wise was the pace. It seemed really slow in parts, especially the beginning, with little Chiyo and Pumpkin- who let's face it, weren't the greatest actors in the world. It also seemed a bit cut-and-paste from the book, I haven't read it so I can't know for sure, but that's the impression I got; sort of logical but a bit rough around the edges, not quite 'fitting' together. Script- bad. Didn't like it all, of course a great actor can save a bad script, but putting the onus on non-English born speakers to carry it is kind of..well not a good decision. It seemed a really clunky mix of English/Japanese expression from both then and now- it wasn't uniform or streamlined or anything, just noticeably random.The worst worst worst decision the producers/directors made about this film was deciding to do it in English. Of course whether that decision was made because they had already chosen the Chinese actresses, and therefore couldn't do it in Japanese (can you imagine if they'd done it in Chinese!...the furor! :o) or because they knew it wouldn't be eligible for any Oscars except best foreign film (bit hazy on Oscar guidelines but I assume films in other languages automatically go under 'foreign' even if they're American produced?), I don't know. I just hate seeing these sorts of films, clearly about a specific culture, produced in a language other than their culture. It just doesn't work. It's so jarring and obvious- the English language against this foreign backdrop with foreign actors. I always always see foreign films in the language they were originally produced in- there really is no substitute, and it is exponentially better than seeing it with dubs- no matter how good the dub. It breaks my heart they didn't do this in Japanese! Personally, I believe if they would have to have sacrificed the Chinese actors then so be it. The English was poorly spoken, which therefore affected the acting and made it difficult to hear what they were saying at times. I feel so much for those actresses, struggling to wring good performances out of a language that they obviously were not capable enough in (with some exceptions). It's one thing to speak fluent conversational English, or even at a high literary level, but to have to act in another language...few actors/actresses are capable of it really. And of course unlike say English and french, or Italian or any other Latin/Germanic- based language, the oriental languages just have no similar grounding at all- in phonetics, print, anything. Overall (finally the conclusion!) this movie looked great, although I would have liked greater focus/better lighting for the costume since they were putting so much work into it, but it would have been better in Japanese, with Japanese actresses, or else without dialogue at all! Just a series of beautiful moving pictures- real art, as opposed to this film/art hybrid which doesn't really work in this particular case.",Memoirs of a Geisha
245,marvinbluth,"Two hours , plus, of sheer boredom,,,,,,",3,12 December 2005,"This is not a good movie, despite what some people are saying. I love these actresses, and have absolutely LOVED most of the movies I've seen them in. This film seemed to be wandering aimlessly, with a thread-bare plot, and really was more of a sleep-inducing experience, then anything else. THE ROAD HOME, probably was made for 1/20th the cost, and is infinitely better on every level. Yes, the cinematography is okay, but it doesn't compare to HERO, or HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS. And I even found the music to be really messy, really ""oriental light"", or something. Take this as a warning. And the colored contact lenses, that made the heroines eyes look glaucomic, were more disturbing then anything else, DIDN'T ANYONE NOTICE THAT WHEN THEY WERE MAKING THE FILM??",Memoirs of a Geisha
246,tony-peterson,The only English language film ever made that needs English subtitles!,4,26 March 2006,"After doing such a wonderful job of the film CHICAGO, you wouldn't have thought that the Director, Rob Marshall could do anything wrong. Well, think again.What an absolute load of drivel this film is.I could hardly understand a word of dialogue in the entire film. This must be the only English language film ever made that needs English subtitles! There was much fuss made of the fact that Chinese actors played Japanese roles and that the Japanese were insulted by this. Surely they'd be more insulted by the stilted, stereotypical fake Asian accents used throughout the film.And as for the film's three Oscars (!): Best Cinematography, Art Direction and Costume Design? Heavens!! Haven't Oscar's standards dropped over the years! If you want to find out anything about a geisha's life, then watch the 1962 Shirley MacLaine film, MY GEISHA. Even though it's a typical 1960's romantic comedy, that particular film will explain, in much greater detail, all you'll need to know. And in a much more entertaining way, I might add.",Memoirs of a Geisha
247,ss3,Gorgeous,10,29 December 2005,"A very fine gorgeous, gorgeous, film, which it should be. I love one of the viewer's comments that entertainment circles have somehow turned against beauty. I once loved that about Hollywood. How Angela Jolie is being cast in action feminist flicks is beyond me, but beauty, what can I say, it still enchants, bewitches, sends me to another planet. Having spent ten days in Kyoto's extraordinary gardens during cherry blossom time, and having gone to the very theater on that one night that is presented in the movie ( where Geishas still hope to find the patronage of a wealthy benefactor) the breathtaking dance of Sayuri beat anything I saw that night. Yes I have Western tastes and undoubtedly there are a thousand and one Chinese distortions of Japanese rituals in this movie. I suppose if this criticism is coming from Japanese audiences it is valid for them. But God, Spielberg was on target to pick the director of Chicago to stage this feast. The talent was extraordinary, John Williams, Yo Yo Ma, Istzhack Pearlman, the acting, and yes, I loved the screenplay. The early very unbeautiful Japan reminded me of David Lean's Oliver and the rest, after Sayuri become enchanted and decided to devote her life to becoming a Geishas is a great great story whether snobs consider it melodrama or not. Indeed I have come to take this particular criticism as a sign I am going to love a movie. Lean could go from black and white dreary Oliver to Dr. Zhivago so hurrah for Rob Marshall, and Steven Spielberg's lavish taste and the wonderful movie they have brought us.I'd place it among my all time favorites, but then last week I was ready to place Spanglish (speaking of beautiful women)in the same place. Maybe my head is getting soft the more I relax and throw away my absurd developed tastes and replace it with what drew me to movies in the first place, sheer enjoyment of a great story. The more the suffering lovers are made to pay for their longing the more satisfying the resolution. That story will never get old, precisely because it is unrealistic That is why we need it.

249,theSecretAlchemist,A good film - it is that simple,9,29 January 2007,"The international cast and crew of Memoirs of a Geisha do a good job of adapting a great book. The performances from the three Chinese female leads are captivating, with Li Gong coming out on top. The atmospheric opening captures the poverty and desperation of an age that forced people to sell their children. Yakusho Koji is as commanding as ever in his role of the proud but self-loathing industrialist. Only Kaori Momoi and Ken Watanabe fail to excel, managing competent rather than thrilling performances. The story moves along at a brisk pace, the sets and costume design are dazzling, and the whole thing keeps you enthralled to the end.So why do people love to beat up on this movie? It boils down to some specious arguments about what is authentically Japanese. There are only two points to make about this. First of all, if Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley can play Germans in Schindler's List, Robert Carlyle can play a Russian in 007's The World is Not Enough, Geoffrey Rush can play an English courtier in Elizabeth, and Chara can play a Chinese hooker in Swallowtail, then why is Chinese actors playing Japanese a problem? And second, if authenticity is so prized in Japan, why are so many of the Westerners with bit parts in Japanese films so clearly miscast? Go look at the little Indian guy playing a Portuguese in 7 gatsu 24 ka dôri no Kurisumasu to see what I mean. How do you say 'double standards' in Japanese?Memoirs is a cracking tale well put together by conscientious filmmakers.

I find it to be an amazing movie.What do so many people have against it?I know there are some moments where it does not commit to the original book, but what film does? The Harry Potter series do not commit one hundred percent to the books, because then we would have freaking long movies! It's the same case with this one. And apparently people were outraged with Chinese actors playing Japanese characters? What about British and American actors? British actors hide their accent to have an American voice and vice versa, and do we start an outrage over that? People shouldn't dislike this movie for silly reasons like that. Just watch it for the beauty it possesses and maybe you'll see why it is such a fantastic movie. Give it a chance.

251,sonikbaby2000,Rob Marshall enforces American ignorance with Asian Cliché,1,5 January 2006,"Wow. Very disappointing. This movie COULD of been so much more. But Rob Marchell decided he was going to be a closed minded American and not choose an authentic route to this movie. A lot about this movie was just appallingly Asian Cliché! Allot of the details Rob verbally admitted to not pay attention too and, boy, does it SHOW! So many things bugged me about this movie. I'll start with the biggest issue hair, makeup and dress. Wrong wrong and wrong. In fact, because he did it wrong it made the actresses look very unattractive! I thought ZZ looked like an alien. Her debut hair was a tight ugly square knot on the top of her head making her look awkward. The scene were they put rice around her pillow so she doesn't ruin her hair was ridiculous because her hair was pulled back in a tight bun, so laying on the side of your head wouldn't ruin the hair at all! Authentic geisha hair is very full and pulled out on the side, so yes, laying on your hair would flatten it down! So that was just stupid. They had two scenes where they were wearing all RED robes, now that was just VERY Asian cliché, RED is a traditional Chinese color that is prominent in Chinese culture and I know that rob marshall only put in those ALL red outfits because Americans would associate that with 'asian' since we are exposed to Chinese culture more then Japanese. I thought that was just tacky. I could go on and on. When I look at pictures of REAL geisha's they are soo beautiful and pristine and wonderful and the nuances and detail in there dress and hair is what makes them so very appealing and Rob Marchall just TRASHED all of this! He is so very ignorant.Now on to the 'dance' scene. Wow! First thought out of my head after that scene was: 'Worst dancing EVER'. OK, Now I would of been fairly OK with spicing up the traditional Japanese dance a little because it is allot more nuanced and slow then what we are accustomed too. So I was expecting a COOL dance scene like in 'HERO'. UH no.... She was flailing around in these ugly CLOWN shoes acting like she was having a seizure on stage!!! That had to be the WORST choreographing I have EVER seen! Next issue language: OK the fact that they couldn't speak English was a big no no. The acting was wooden and forced and the dialog awkward. It was annoying. If they spoke in fluent correct English then the movie would of been A lot better. Casting Chinese actresses is also a big no no. How culturally insensitive can you be?and now story. Wow! Rob marshall effectively dumbed down the plot to middle school level. All the nuances in the book were ignored and looked over to fill in with cliché, cat fight, the crass and the obvious. Yeah, Rob Marshall was the WRONG director. Which really upsets me. This is my Favorite book and I have been looking forward to this movie for 6 YEARS! And not only that but because he bombed on this movie I doubt that we will see another movie in the genre for a LONG time. Which is too bad, Hollywood really needed some new material.

Also curious why more Japanese actresses weren't used in the movie. I was in Vietnam this past winter and noticed that there was some grumbling out of China over using so many Chinese actresses in the movie; I tend to see that as a compliment, but I understand the Sino-Japanese riff. While I enjoyed the movie I found the featurettes on how the movie was made to be more interesting than the movie. (Anyone else feel the same?)

I know women probably had few choices during this time period, but a movie based on a small girl carrying a crush for so long on a man who bought her a snowball seemed lame to me. Behind the scenes at the geisha house seemed like drag queens squabbling. I kept thinking that Joan Collins kind of looks like a geisha nowadays! Or a mime, I can't decide. Geishas may have been artists and not courtesans, but the movie made it seem the ultimate was still to find a rich man to finance the ""eel and the cave"" story.

But wait, it doesn't stop there, it was also painful to watch because a little girl was being abused by everyone around her.After watching this movie I wonder how one could have respect for Japanese culture. Is everyone in Japan so depressed and hopeless? I am not very familiar with the culture but I have a hard time believing this was an accurate picture. It appears to be more of a stereotypical example of artsy self pity culture. You are probably familiar with it ""Oh life is dull and drab yet somehow we find beauty in our suffering. Alas lets all whine together and protest the meaningless of life, sighhh"". Yuck! Half way through the movie I was hoping the main character would just step in front of a bus or something so that the darn thing would end.The pinnacle of the badness of the movie was the little cat fight competition between the two Geishas. It was like watching two cheerleaders fight over a boyfriend. Yet, one cheerleader was so obviously vindictive and evil that there is no way in reality anyone would have put up with her for five minutes to begin with. Gee, whose side should I take? Could the characters at least be a little deeper than the ones in finger puppet shows. I guess they wanted to leave us no chance to feel sorry for the other geisha.I'll have to remember never to buy ice cream for any adolescent girls, and risk having them stalk me for the rest of my life.What a weird depressing and don't forget Boring movie.",Memoirs of a Geisha

The book managed to get beyond Japonism and give us a fascinating glimpse at a strange and wonderful aspect of Japanese culture, IE. the unique living art form of the geisha. The film never gets past its flamboyant art direction, which reaches ludicrous heights at some points particularly during the solo geisha dance sequence. If anyone wants to have a more interesting look at geisha life they ought to go to the films of Kenji Mizoguchi of half a century ago. Another detail that bothered me was the fact that although the film was obviously done in the English language it would occasionally throw in some Japanese dialogue which made no sense at all. I find details like that irritating. Even John Williams who has done such masterful work in so many films provides what I consider just a serviceable score of no great distinction.",Memoirs of a Geisha

I know adaptations can not be perfect but I must say that this is by far one of the worst when you can not even look at main characters and even remotely associate them with the book. Nobu, Mother and Aunty's characters are all so distorted and I considered Hatsumomo really downplayed! I feel a much better job could have been done on this movie.

Also the story is romantic and in the same time - heavy, because the Geisha is so fragile, and she is suffering all her life. It's really amazing love story, and I think it shows the reality in the past. It's very hard to understand, but the action is taking place in the beginning of the 20th century - not so far in time, but so different from nowadays.

However, the true merit of the film lies in the fact that its sumptuous style does not outweigh substance, something particularly thankful given that such an imbalance was so unfortunately true of House of Flying Daggers, the last major release to star Ziyi Zhang. Instead, the truly enchanting performance of 12-year old Suzaka Oghu, who plays the young Sayuri for the first half hour, ensures attention is captured within her character's story for the rest of the drama. This allows the script to remain pleasingly understated, and also means the unlikely nature of the romance can be overlooked.The hibernation that the story withdraws into during the wartime years could so easily have been damaging, but in the event the portrayal of how the post-war influx of American troops corrupted Japan's ancient traditions is just as excellent as the rest of the film.",Memoirs of a Geisha

If you are a little less shallow than that (which i desperately hope you are) then you'd be enjoying the most visually extravagant and emotionally charged film of the year. All the actors were brilliantly casted, namely Michelle Yeoh and Gong Li, and the cinematography was saturated with bright colours.

261,circlelink,A Very Intense and Insightful Movie,10,5 January 2006,"I found this movie most - how can I say - deeply insightful. I found it sad how women are treated in this world. How they are treated like chattel. The farmer had a choice - he did not have to give the girls away - if they had been boys he would have taught them to fend for themselves in spite of the death of the mother. I don't know if this is or is not what you say - - a ""spoiler"" - I just am relating what I have felt in this movie - as I have just seen it.I have known about Geisha for sometime. I have heard them call 'whores' and I venture to say a high priced call girl - however now I know it is not true. They women have no choice -- it was either that or what? Go where? To what? In a land full of poverty and lost hope - with only their metaphors to guide them - I saw a country of men voided of emotion that they or whomever - devised a way for them to seek pleasure in the world of pain -- pain and competition they have created themselves. I saw men with no other type of life or vision of how to have relationships - come to a place in their own unconscious and seek deep deep dark hide-away to release their expectations on woman after woman - for they are so devoid of any way to grow into anything other than what? In the world of the geisha time stands still and nothing matters and moves without the say so of a man - and they do and are whatever it takes to please his ""favor"" - I found it horrifying. Just like today - the clothes we wear are made from the blood and sweat of young girls we never see - we don't know what they have to do to make our clothes and if we did -- and since I do - sometimes I rather be naked than to know of the horrible slave labor that is going on and we refuse to see it.The way of the geisha is sad and full of mixed signals and deception - and how our dear young one believed in people to her detriment - her innocence preceded her and was so brilliantly captive and awe stricken - then the next moment I was horrified at how people can hurt another because of the life they were cast in to play.Like a pair of unlucky dice I saw the young girl learn about life the hard way and suffice it to say it was heartbreaking as well are heart touching - I went from a scale of emotion -- my only damp question was -- ""isn't there a gun in this place?"" That girl needed to shoot lots of people cause I tell you if had a gun -- several people would be dead and I would be in jail -- enough of geisha for me. Another thing -- they need to teach these girls karate or something -- no one told her about a kick to the balls? It would have saved her in more than one occasion!The actors were awesome -- why is this not up for an Oscar? It is surely worthy -- again another snub - this movie is great! I was completely enthralled and sadden - then hope at last comes -- my goodness - there is light at the end of any tunnel -- for I was so happy for the geisha -- whose life was changed by a small red ice cone.Kudos - to the cast - to the director and to Isthak Perlman -- the violin out did it self in this movie -- marvelous -- marvelous - simply marvelous!",Memoirs of a Geisha

Since I first picked it up six years ago, I've read it to the point of near memorization. My biggest fear would be that the movie would destroy what the book so carefully constructed.I was thrilled when I saw that the movie kept relatively true to the book. With any novel-to-screen adaption, things are lost. This is a rare exception, where the changes help those who haven't read the novel understand what is going on. Even the condensing of events doesn't leave the viewer feeling as if something might be missing.The cinematography is amazing. The use of symbolism and color emphasize the storyline, and portray the subtleties of geisha life. It also shows that geisha are not prostitutes, but women who are elite entertainers. The score by John Williams sounds traditionally Japanese, and features cello solos by Yo-Yo Ma and violin solos by Itzhak Perlman. If anything, the movie will garner attention for the simple things like the visual and musical aspects.The biggest issue most people have is the fact that they cast Chinese actresses in the lead roles of Sayuri, Mameha, and Hastumomo.

Chayanne, who is Puerto Rican, played a Cuban in Dance With Me (1998), but I didn't hear everyone getting bent out of shape about it. And back in the early days of cinema, it wasn't uncommon for a white person to ""black"" themselves, and play an African or African-American. Who cares about the ethnicity of an actor or actress? If anything, I am in awe of Michelle Yeoh, Li Gong, and Zhang Ziyi who were able to step past the cultural barrier and completely transform themselves into the roles of a geisha. I understand that there is still some sensitivity about Chinese actresses playing such a iconic Japanese role, and that it stems from both sides. But great acting does matter. If a Russian-born actor can establish his career playing the King of Siam (I'm talking about Yul Bryner), ethnicity shouldn't matter. Talent should, and that is where Marshall made the right choice in casting.I can't wait until this movie comes out on DVD and I can watch it again and again. By not losing everything that made the book a stand out, this movie will be a sleeper hit, attract those with an interest in Asian culture and the fans of the book. Don't knock it until you see it.",Memoirs of a Geisha

I wish I had seen this in theaters! The cast performed with emotion and heart, and the two young main leads for the first portion of the movie are very impressive. The story is a touching love story and though you kind of know what's going to happen- since it is an American movie- you can't help but still feel for Suyuri throughout the movie. The story itself is inspiring, albeit predictable, but I am not complaining that it is so. It simply is, and that is that. Still very much worth watching. I have not read the book, but the voice-overs and narration are beautifully poetic and are wonderful additions if they did not come from the book.

266,playersww,beautiful and exotic but uninspiring,6,10 December 2005,"This film promised to be so much, so many things: an historic peek into traditional Japan, the secret world of a dazzling culture revealed, a compelling story of seduction, power and duty. Some of these themes were much better explored in last years ""The Last Samurai"", not the greatest film but at least it did what it set out to do. ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" reminded me of last decade's ""Hang the Red Lantern"" and ""Farewell My Concubine"", both tales of secret Oriental worlds and deep love versus duty. And although the art direction depicting prewar Japan was moving, ""Memiors of a Geisha"" felt more like a clunky Kung Fu melodrama than a deeply serious unveiling of Japanese culture, so restrained, so intense. The lack of Japanese talent in the cast and especially in the title role was the main flaw in the film (that and the abundance of white men at the helm trying to fake their way through understanding Japan's shadow world). The lead, Ziyi Zhang had little feeling for her all important part. She played it or she was directed to play it like a depressed sourpuss who had no magic, no sex-appeal and only over acting to offer. Then every 15 minutes or so we were ""told"" through narration that the world of a Geisha was a ""shadow world"", a floating world, where her every movement was a magical seduction, a ritualized perfection. And yet there she was, Sayuri, supposedly the the most celebrated Geisha alive, and she was about as magical as a mug of lite beer. I have seen woman in Akira Kurosawa films combing their hair in such a ""floating world"" way that tears came to my eyes and I was ready to lay my life on the line for the actress, an actress whose eyes moved just so... whose fingers arched poetically just so. Wow, where was that in this film? That's the whole movie. This magical traditional Geisha and her deep deep secrets.I think that a fine Japanese actress would have that kind of sense of specialized Japanese tradition in her guts. She would be trained in Kabuki and Noh the way that classically trained Western performers learn Shakespeare. So, for me, all other good things were pushed aside by the fact that the lead did not succeed in the role. I wish that I could be more generous with this film, but this was such a good project, there shouldn't have been any mistakes. The only thing that they had the right to ask us was...""please forgive us for using the blue contact lenses but we had no choice"". That I was willing to over look in the lead, but nothing else.",Memoirs of a Geisha
267,kammm,Visually Stunning But Not Emotionally Deep (Spoilers),4,21 December 2005,"This is an intimate story about an oppressed woman who longs for one man most of her life. But instead of bringing us into her world, we are shown the sparkle and dazzle of her life but not the heart. For ex, the film doesn't explain what a Geisha is. Is she a prostitute? No? Then why is she sold for the highest bidder? The audience needs to know these things to hook into Sayura and let her story become ours. Instead we get to see the beautiful costumes, sets, make up, dances. A great movie is an emotional as well as a visual experience. I think Rob Marshall was the wrong choice. He is great at musicals and show, but not at bringing us into the heart of a woman's longing. The third act, which is the most important, is about four minutes long, unmotivated (why did The Chairman change his mind and tell her now?), and unsatisfying (oh I get the love of my life but not really?)...This movie is a mile wide and an inch deep.

268,oldwilli,This should have been a 10-hour TV miniseries,5,27 March 2007,"Apologies if this repeats comments already made but with over 240 comments I don't have a month to read them all.My wife mentioned to an office co-worker that we were going to rent this movie on the weekend. The co-worker, who was born in Kyoto and spent the first 25 years of her life there, told my wife to wait until we had read the book before seeing the movie then loaned us the book. I'm really glad she did so for we would have found the movie terribly confusing without the background of the book.As numerous others have commented, it was technically wonderful, but keeping it down to two-and-a-half hours still left out the details to make you appreciate the politics and difficulties that the geisha had to persevere to be the best.For example, a two-minute scene shows Chiyo wincing in pain as her hair is being made up, falling asleep on an uncomfortable looking ""pillow"" surrounded by salt then waking up exasperated when she realizes she has let her hair off the pillow and it's full of salt. What it doesn't describe is that the hair-do took hours to create and she will have to endure several hours of having her hair painfully redone again as a result.In another scene when Dr Crab ""wins"" Chiyo's virginity via a fixed auction, the movie simple shows Chiyo preparing herself and laying back for her deflowering then jumps to the next scene. In the book (in an amusing/disgusting scene) it is revealed that Dr Crab is a ""collector"" of sorts and carries a small kit with memoirs of each young lady he has deflowered and explains why he bid so aggressively during the auction.WW2 created significant difficulty and deprivation for the Gion geisha that covered several chapters in the book - this was reduced to about twelve minutes of boredom in the movie.When the movie finished my wife's comment was ""At least the $5 rental saved us $22 of boredom at the cinema"". While interesting, the 2+ hours did an injustice to the book. A 10-hour TV movie miniseries would have allowed the detail that made the book so interesting to be fleshed out properly.",Memoirs of a Geisha

But on the other hand Zhang Ziyi and Michelle Yeoh (especially Michelle) give some of their best performances. Still... the film is not worthy of the screen and mocks the movie in too much melodrama that feels like a redo of ""Chicago.""

Although it caught me by surprise that the film turned out to be in English, I really don't think it detracts from the overall effectiveness of the film. The broken English, in my opinion, is not as bad as many critics make out, and in fact I find Watanabe's accent quite endearing. Besides the language issue (and any issues re: using Chinese actresses) I think the film is very well-made. My particular affinity for this film lies in the superb cinematography that portrays the beautiful landscapes of early 20th Century Japan and the geisha tradition (as well as the beautiful Zhang Ziyi). However this is not the only thing going for this film, as the story draws you into what life would be like, not only for geishas, but also for the different layers of social life that geisha Chiyo/Sayuri interacts with. If it drags on, I didn't notice, and I give this film a 7 and a half out of ten (or I would if I could).",Memoirs of a Geisha

While the beautiful sets, costumes, landscapes and cinematography pique the senses, the entire plot-line is uneventful and tedious. 'Memoirs of a Geisha' had great potential to show the mysterious world of the geisha but failed to show this world with any great sympathy or glory. The characters have no depth and react to their surroundings with dull apathy; thus, the actors hadn't the chance to perform at any real level of quality. As well, the casting of this film was an insult to the Japanese and the tradition of the geisha in that the main characters were Chinese actors.

This is one of the most visually stunning and entrancing films I have ever seen, with a wonderful storyline which had me clutching the edge of my seat in sheer frustration! I absolutely loved the love story that was central to the film, although I was a bit worried by the age gap. lol. It made me really want a snow cone though. I thought Zhang Ziyi was fantastic in the part of Sayuri, and she made the character very endearing and real. I am a big fan of Ken Watanabe, and it was good to see him in a part like this; the relationship was very believable and I thought they were both great. In fact, all the actors in this film did their characters justice and helped to make the film as beautiful and Oscar-worthy as it is.

276,fariceislands,Memoirs of a Giesha/Sayuri - A Japanese Cinderella,4,16 January 2006,"This movie is indeed as many have said, a cherry-blossom laden Westernised vision of Japan - with the most schmaltzy Hollywood ending since Doris Day and Rock Hudson rode off into the the sunset - (and I think the joke was on us, dear reader!) As a non-Japanese with an interest in the culture, I found several inaccuracies, although trivial on their own, cumulatively eroded my enjoyment of the whole. Before I saw the film, I was willing to overlook the use of so many non-Japanese actors - but having seen the film, I have come to the conclusion it was rather like allowing Frenchman to re-enact the Battle of Naseby (for US readers make that Gettysburg). Yes, they could be made to look the part, well nearly.....but they certainly didn't sound like it..... As a result in the end the portrayal was unconvincing. While the kimono's were largely correct and gorgeous, the makeup and hairstyles, were much less so. Although set in the 1930's, the hairstyles adopted are far more to likely to be seen on today's catwalks than on Maiko and Geiko of 70 years ago. The white geisha make-up was all but non-existent. They did not even bother the follow the tradition of depicting the trainee geisha (the Maiko) with only her bottom lip painted red - all the principal actresses sported Max Factor pouts from the off,,,,,,,,, The performances were solid throughout. Li Gong relishes her part, and the young Suzuka Ohgo as the young Chiyo (Sayuri) stood out. Ziyi Zhang is beautiful - but she is simply not Japanese. Michelle Yeoh is indeed elegant and beautiful as Mameba, the mentor of Sayuri - but I found her long brown hair a reminder of her days as a Bond girl - and this trivial annoyance kept drawing me away from the 1930's. The hero - the Chairman - played mercifully by a Japanese, Ken Watanabe, aged not one iota in the 26 years of the story, falling in love with the heroine who was all of 9 at the time. The nine year old heroine instantly fell in love with him too. Why? All because he bought her a cherry ice, a little bit of kindness in her life of drudgery. I found that scenario entirely too much to accept, and is it really the best example of female psychology the script could come up with? But wait, hang psychology, as in the tradition of the worst western romantic fiction the women are either, bitches, whores, (both in the case of Hatsumomo played by Li Gong) - or dewy eyed victims waiting for Fate and prayer to save them from all their undeserved suffering at the hands of others. And of course, also in the tradition of the worst romantic fiction, by the end, Fate and/or prayers are always answered in full for the heroine. The worst felony for me came in the cursory handling of the war. I hoped WWII might give the story the edge it so desperately needed. Maybe Sayuri's long lost sister might reappear, might we through her come to understand something of the hardship of those years? But no, the conflict was dismissed in a few scenes; a few army trucks, a bit of panic and a small phalanx of planes. After the war, Mameba reappears only slightly less well dressed, but still as beautiful - and Sayuri is now escorting American top brass. Sayrui's dance scene, (an after-thought) was a bad idea. It was far too modern and looked like a perfume advert or a catwalk warm up to me..... Although flawed, I found myself constantly thinking of James Clavell's 'Shogun' - particularly the beauty of the actresses. Undoubtedly there was a Japanese actress who could have taken the lead ,but given the actresses cast were names from other box-office smashes, you don't have to look too far for the Producers thinking. The only concession was they used a Japanese actress for the adult Sayrui's voice-overs. That seems a bit of an insult to me.On the positive side, I was impressed by the cinematography ...but in the end, the glory of the visuals only made me more discontent that the adaption did not match it. The surprising fact that the film was largely shot in Hollywood could be seen as a plus, except that it probably reveals more than intended. Maybe no Japanese studio worth their salt would have put their Mon onto such a loose and fundamentally flawed depiction of what is a complex, artistic and spiritual culture as that of the world of the Geiko. I was hoping for more than a slick, up-market melodrama. Perhaps if this story had been animated by Disney as a sort of Japanese Cinderella - with few saccharin songs along the way - I would have enjoyed it more. As it is, if you want to see these excellent actors again might I suggest the following, any one of which is a much more satisfying way to spend a couple of hours:Ken Watanabe - 'The Last Samauri, Batman Begins' or even check out the Japanese drama, 'Kita no Zeronen' 'One Year in the North'. also made in 2005, where incidentally Suzuka Ohgo also reappears.Michelle Yeoh - 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' Ziyi Zhang - 'Hero' 'House of Flying Daggers' Li Gong - 'The Emperor and the Assassin' 'Farwell my Concubine'If you want to spend more time with Sayuri, I have one piece of advice: read the book, it's much better than this flabby adaption........",Memoirs of a Geisha

Which leads us to the perfection of the audiovisual work: perfect image and perfect sound for our brains.

279,thursdaynightmovieclub,Thursday Night Movie Club Review by Adam,6,24 April 2006,"This film left me wondering what to say, so I'll begin with a plot description. The story follows the life a young girl, who along with her sister is taken from her family to be sold. The girl, eventually named Sayuri, is accepted by a geisha house while her sister is not. Sayuri seems to get herself in an inordinate amount of trouble around the geisha house. She does not get along with the head geisha of the house, Hatsumomo. Her antics escalate to a level where she is no longer approved to continue geisha training and becomes the house slave.While on the street one day, she meets up with an older gentleman who treats her with kindness and respect and at this point she decides that she must become a geisha. She believes that she will meet up with him again one day. The film follows Sayuri throughout training and shows us how she becomes one of the most famous geishas in Japan. Amazingly, she is able to meet again with her unrequited love.Have we heard this story before? Yes, it is a Cinderella-esquire story. The problem with this film is that it is set to an excruciatingly slow pace. You really aren't too concerned with the characters other than Sayuri, and you aren't even that drawn in to her life either. There was just something about this film that left you feeling uninvolved in the story and characters.Enough of the bad. What is positive about this film? It is visually stunning! The lighting is phenomenal, the caliber of which you only see maybe once every few years. The art direction and production design go hand in had with the cinematography. Unbelievable. There is no doubt one can see why the film was nominated for Oscars in these categories. We can't forget John Williams working with Yo-Yo Ma on the score. Good stuff.If theorizing on what the problem with this film ""working"" was, there would be a few different explanations. The film was epic in nature in the scenery, design, and even the typically minimal character development. Epics usually revolve around a huge event or part of time such as war, disasters, etc. This film was a small love story set in an epic film, when it probably should have been an epic love story set in a small film. If you are a fan of the visual arts, you will probably sit in amazement and admiration. If you have never sat in a film and said ""that's some beautiful lighting or costuming,"" avoid this film at all costs.Thursday Night Movie Club Rating: $4.75/$8.00 ""Mischief. Mayhem.

And the acting is done extremely well by all.I haven't read the book and I know very little of Japanese culture. Or Chinese.I have two issues with the movie - the first one being the young pre-teen? Girl falling in love with an older married man and eventually they end up together. When will our society stop having older married men ending up with young girls? (Creeps and predators). But I guess that's the story behind the book. So . . .The second issue I have is in many of the other movie comments, I guess. Many people don't like the fact that Chinese women are playing Japanese women. Isn't that the role of an actor? -to play something they're not? Why is everyone so unhappy when people from one race play another? No one gets upset if an actor plays a spy, criminal, housewife, or even a tree. I thought the job of an actor is to dress up, put on some makeup and role play, and hopefully provide entertainment for people who need an escape from everyday life for a few hours.

287,rosalyn-1,A well acted fairy tale but not an insight on Japanese culture,7,1 April 2006,"I watched this movie twice on DVD and it is an enjoyable film. The acting was just excellent. I'd like to especially point out Gong Li as Hatsumomo who steals the show whenever she is on the screen. This is her English Language debut and she is sure to go on to be an even bigger international star. The movie was beautifully photographed and costumed, and the dancing was cool, although the pivotal dance by Sayuri shocked me because it seemed out of place in this work. The winter dance definitely had roots in the modern dance movement, which had started at that time, but had probably not permeated Japanese society yet. Also, later forms of Japanese modern dance such as Butoh stress extremely slow flowing movement that the director and choreographer did not seem to like. I did quite like the huge shoes though.Overall the movie was an enjoyable fairy tale about Geisha, but it does not reveal the true inner life of a Geisha any more than the movie ""A chorus Line"" reveals the true inner life of a Broadway actor and actress. The gritty non-photogenic realities of life were no where to be seen. It is a man's view of a woman's world, like ""Fight club"" written by women. Women's concerns like unwanted children or periods were no where to be seen, but then again that is just as well, because as they said over and over in the ""making of"" videos, ""This is not a documentary"".And yet, watching this film makes me want to see dramatized the personal story of a real Geisha such as Ikumatsu (Geisha to the revolutionary leader Kido Takayoshi).

It tells a beautiful love story about a geisha and a man. However, the movie seriously butchers the book and takes many liberties that do not exist in the original. As an adaptation, it failed miserably.In my opinion, there are several things which were left out from the book (or changed outright) that should have been included and left alone. Without these essentials, the tone and voice of the story is completely different.For instance, when Sayuri goes to the Baron's house, she is not found afterwards by Mr. Bekku. In the book, Mr Bekku says something like, ""Did he take your clothes off?"" ""Did he touch you?"" And the girl answers no, he only looked. Mr. Bekku determines that nothing needs to be mentioned to Mahema.Yet in the film, Mr. Bekku is nowhere to be found in this scene, and instead, we find Sayuri getting verbally berated for an action that did not happen. It is only in the bidding war for her mizuage that Mahema finds her innocent.This change in the story line (while subtle, and still resulting in the same end; of the Baron and Dr. Crab doing the bidding) changes the undertone of the story completely into something else. Yet it was still a good movie. If you allow it to stand alone and do not consider the adaptation real.",Memoirs of a Geisha

291,basak-tosun,Language problem,8,11 February 2006,"I just saw this film. I very much liked the music and the scenes. However, the language really annoyed me. I would enjoy it much more if the movie was in Japanese with Turkish sub-titles (It was in English with Turkish subtitles). If the film were in Japanese, we had a chance to hear how Japanese sounds like. Isn't it a very nice way of learning about other cultures and languages? But of course, since Americans do not like watching films with sub-titles the film was made in broken-English of non-American actors. It was very funny hearing Japanese people in kimonos speaking in English among themselves and from time to time saying Japanese words like ""arigatto"".I am afraid that new American generations is growing up with the image that English is in the only language in the world, however other nations can not speak it well for some reason(because they are inferior or something like that). Is it only me who is curious about different languages and loves to hear them when native people are speaking? Movies are great way of hearing the languages, don't you think so?",Memoirs of a Geisha
292,biffo2,Doesn't compare to the book,5,23 May 2006,"'Memoirs of a Geisha' is an amazing novel, and having heard it was going to be made into a film starring Zhang Ziyi and Gong Li (one of my favourite actresses) I was very excited. What I found was a very stylish, beautifully shot costume drama that ultimately didn't have a lot to show for itself.The novel has a brilliant story and wonderful characters, but in this film the whole story was rushed and condensed, big parts of the novel were missing, and generally the way it was filmed seemed more focused on beautiful imagery and fancy direction rather than intimate storytelling. As a result, it didn't create anything like the drama of the book and I just felt that it was all style and no substance.In terms of acting, I feel that the film would have been better if they'd had Japanese actresses speaking their own language, or possibly Asian actresses who at least had a good grasp of English. It's not a great thing to say, but the fact is with acting you need to be able to use language effectively, and none of the actors in this film could do that. Their speech was slow, stunted and often mispronounced or misinterpreted words. I'm sure they're good actresses, but just the difficulty with which they spoke the language came across heavily on screen and I felt this crippled the drama somewhat.That said, I feel that 'Memoirs of a Geisha' is a very mediocre film. If you haven't read the book, than you may like it, if so, then you're going to be seriously disappointed. This is an artistic, elaborate showcase of a film - it's not about people, the story is a very mellow version of the book and the characters are spoilt by actresses who communicate badly. This film is all about pretty costumes and make-up, and I left the cinema feeling very disappointed.",Memoirs of a Geisha
293,nikki20194,Could have been much better,4,8 January 2006,"As with most films the book is far better than the film adaptation. There were some things going for this film namely the costumes and scenery which were excellent.For me the film felt about 30-40minutes too long, if they had lopped off a chunk it would have felt far less staid. The acting wasn't top notch, I never felt pulled into the story. Also, I felt the character development wasn't strong enough. The antagonists just didn't come across very antagonistic. In fact throughout the film none of the characters really told their stories too well. It was easy to understand the movement of the film but it just wasn't anywhere as deep as the book.All in all, give it a go if you want to see how it was adapted to the screen otherwise I would skip it. The period set/costumes were excellent, I just found everything else pretty mediocre my score a 4/10.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Her life was tainted with tragedy, until she finds a light in her dark path. She decides to follow this light as a means of living and hoping again. Every breath was to get closer to the light.The acting in this movie was superb. All the actresses were excellent. The music was wonderful, depicting every moment she was feeling.

295,audacious4u,The Best Film of the Year,10,29 July 2006,"I ordered the DVD of this movie and I have watched it 3 times already. This is one of the best movies I have seen and goes down as one of my favorites. So many people are placing too much emphasis on things that are not important and are not even what the story is about. As usual, people never cease to amaze me and forgot its a movie. Who cares if Chinese actors are playing Japanese Geisha. As they specifically stated on the special features... they are not making a documentary. This may not sound ""politically correct"" but forgive most Americans for our ignorance and I'm sure we are not the only country... but it is factual that if you walk up and survey them, most cannot tell the differences of what features belong to which nationally because for those on the outside looking in, there are more similarities to our untrained eyes than there are similarities between Asian nationalities so for us, its not big deal. Also, with the acclaim this film is receiving and the fact that if you check out the bios of most of the other supporting actors save those main 3, they are mostly Japanese so it didn't seem to bother them much as well. As for why Rob Marshall picked those 3, he said himself because they are very talented actresses. Directors choose cast based on talent not race. And they did an excellent job. No one says anything when an Irish actor plays an American born and bred or when an American actor plays an Australian, a Russian, whatever or when a white British actor plays a bi-racial man of black/white mixture. Who says anything yet you all are making a big deal because Chinese actresses where chosen to portray Japanese Geisha?? Please, get real, be happy they aren't doing like they did in the old days when white American actresses played Asian women. Hollywood has come a long way. It's acting, so whoever the director feels has the most talent for the role gets it. This is not the 1st film nor will it be the last to cross blend Asian nationalities in a film. To whoever said the kimonos are wrapped incorrectly with the right over the left, what film did you watch? I just checked that and they are clearly wrapped left over right. The director even explained the slightly different look he wanted the Geisha in the film to have. He showed a little more skin at the back of the neck for sensuality, he told the costume designer, think ""Geisha meets Paris runway"". They wanted the make-up softer and more natural for the film because like they said, they weren't making a documentary but telling a story. People always want to sit back and nick-pick at a film to take away from it. Fact is, its beautifully done, beautifully performed with a beautiful story. For those of you who have so much to say like you grew up in Japanese culture and most of you have never even been there, give it a break. Before you just jump to the conclusions, I always say watch all of the special features when the DVD comes out, you learn so much about why they did things a certain way, and how they did this & that, the planning and all the work that went into bringing the film to life. They had crew members, set designers, writers, actors, producers... they all spent a lot of time in Japan doing a lot of research for this film. They had several classes going teaching many things to the actors... these women studied under real geisha to learn the moves, the posture, the dance, to play the instruments. I for one think they are very lucky because that is something that they can take with them. They were taught everything in Japan by Geisha instructors so how can someone on the outside say its not authentic. They did some filming there but since everything is so modern now, they had to build a set for the city in entirety but they went to Japan and studied the architecture, bought all kinds of Japanese decor, even ordered authentic woods from Japan used in building these structures because they wanted an authentic look. It isn't going to be perfect in every way but they tried there best to allow us to see into another time and culture and I think they did as best a job as could be done. This is not a documentary but a beautiful story that was beautifully portrayed through this film. The author of the book gave all his notes from the time he spent in Japan and with Geishas when writing the novel and he was very pleased, even cried to see his work come to life. So if he think they did an excellent job in portraying the story he told, then who is anyone to say, ""the movie didn't do the book justice"". As usual, people fail to realize, it's a movie, fiction. Arthur Golden himself says people ask him about Sayuri and as real as the story seems because its so moving and so touching, its like, ""hello, she never existed"".",Memoirs of a Geisha
296,boku-2,"No heart, no class, no accuracy.",4,15 January 2006,"Ah I saw the film on Thursday night at an advance screening.I'm not a very critical movie reviewer, but even to me the lack of heart in the movie stood out to so obviously. They had the costumes, the scenery - it was obvious a lot of money was poured into the film. But somewhere along the way the soul of the movie got lost and you're just left with beautiful women in elaborate kimono in front of chocolate-box scenery speaking English (though, like all good orientals they speak in metaphor and offer wise pearls of oriental wisdom *rolls eyes*).It's true what other reviewers have said, it is just like a soap opera. I did feel at some points like I was watching 'Dynasty goes to Japan' or something. They've played down the side of being a geisha which isn't so dramatic or glamorous, and they've played up the bits which they believe might entertain Americans. Understandable approach but it leaves the impression of geisha quite unrealistic and unfair to geisha.Well I suppose it's not a problem if one's a fan of the melodramatics of Dynasty, but for me, I found it hard to take the movie seriously because of this. I didn't feel I was watching an intelligent movie - just something dumbed down and dramatised for the masses.One of my problems with Memoirs is that people will go and see it for a glimpse into the life of a geisha, and they'll be left misinformed in a lot of ways. The movie is called 'Memoirs of a Geisha', which tells you that it's going to be about geisha and a geisha's life. The focus being on geisha (rather than the love story). If the title was 'Memoirs of a Love' or something, then I think I'd be less bothered about the many inaccuracies in the way geisha are presented. It's just the fact that the title and the advertising all stress that it's about geisha. And it is about geisha, but it means that those people who go to see it to learn about geisha are given the wrong impressions.{It's interesting to note that the Japanese title is simply 'Sayuri' which perhaps agrees with my theory, as Japan people are more likely to go and see a film about a girl called Sayuri than an American's idea of geisha.}As for geisha having sex, the way things happen in the movie suggests that one can only become a geisha by selling her virginity. When Sayuri loses her virginity for a pricely sum, she returns to the okiya and the lady who runs the okiya tells her ""Now are you a true geisha"". I went with my friends who don't know much about Japan/geisha and they left the movie believing that selling your virginity was the geisha initiation procedure. It may have happened, but the movie suggested that all proper geisha had sold their virginity.As for the scene where Sayuri's dancing (white kimono, black lighting, confetti) it's absolutely laughable! There is some dancing before her by a group of geisha which is pretty similar to the way real geisha might entertain; more restrained, inoffensive smiles on their faces, classical music etc. But even those geisha have dramatic lighting on them and sometimes you imagine The Pussycat Dolls song 'Don't Cha' (""Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me, don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me ..."") should be playing in the background.Like I said though, Sayuri's performance is laughable. She comes on stage in stark white kimono, all around is black, she does her dramatic dance which is actually presented as arty Japanese dance (complete with taiko to heighten the atmosphere). And then ... confetti falls from the ceiling in the climax of her dance. It looked like a cheap LA strip club! This dance was a last-minute addition by Marshall and it's obvious in the lack of thought that seemed to have gone into it.The accents are another thing which annoyed me! I lived in Malaysia for 5 years, I'm part-Japanese - so I think I'm more at home with Chinese/Japanese accents than your average moviegoer. I had trouble understanding what most of the actors were saying a lot of the time! I love Gong Li but even after watching the scene 5 times where she gets angry with the okiya lady, I still can't understand everything she shouts. Michelle Yeoh is of course perfectly comprehensible as a Malaysian, but with perhaps the exception of Pumpkin and the American characters (American audiences can only enjoy films if there are some American characters in there -_-) - all the actors struggle with English.I give it 5/10. It gains points for being beautifully made (technically speaking) and Gong Li's acting. It loses points for inaccurate scenery (it looks like a cheap Chinese Disneyland, not 1930s Kyoto), that RIDICULOUS dance of Sayuri's and the reinforcing of geisha's negative reputation.",Memoirs of a Geisha
297,Eric_009,Beautiful scenery and not much more,3,15 September 2006,"This movie choreographs tragedy with a nostalgic mood and shallow lines. At nearly 2.5 hours it is about an hour too long. The greatest failure is that the villains and saints behave like caricatures of good and evil. Mother, the geisha house madam, and Hatsumomo, the ruling geisha, hiss and snarl like Cruella De Vil. This makes it difficult to appreciate the cruelty they are intended to portray because it feels like a parody. Similarly, the two saints in the movie, the Chairman and Mameha, are too good to be true and their few flaws seem manufactured and too forgivable to be plausible. Ziyi Zhang made the best of what she had to work with in Sayuri's character, but this seemed to function like an apology for the sterile acting of those around her.That the movie lacked believable characters and an engaging plot does not mean it had nothing worth watching. In fact, if the volume were muted and the duration condensed to 15 minutes of the best cinematography, it would be quite dazzling. Sayuri's dance under artificial snowflakes was stunning. The lighting for this sequence was simply beautiful and even sublime. That there were no lines during this sequence was a bonus, because it felt like Zhang used the dance to break through the restrictions of a tired script, fortune-cookie proverbs, and an embarrassingly ""asian"" version of English.In short, sentimental kitsch with beautiful wardrobes and cherry blossoms. That the movie tried to be tragic and deep only made me blush.",Memoirs of a Geisha

I felt the movie just kept on taking the audience from one place to another without enlightening them as to the significance of the previous scene. I hated the acting...if you can call it that! Even when i understood what the actors were saying, it seemed as if they were merely reading from a script...perhaps some of the actors were so preoccupied with getting the English right that they neglected the idea of character development...(why not cast people who are more fluent at English?) Consequently, i didn't feel any sympathy at all for the lead actress and really didn't care where she ended up. The movie also seemed to move quite slowly, which for someone who is completely lost at times, (like i was having never read the book),is enough to make one eager to get up and leave. Also, I find the idea that a geisha can 'stop a man dead in his tracks', (as portrayed by the actresses in this film) very unconvincing ...I really couldn't understand what all the fuss was about, and despite efforts to define what a geisha actually is,it still remains unclear as you leave the theatre.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Maybe it did not live up to its book but it definitely was a beautiful movie. I remember watching the movie and imagining myself in Japan when the time of the geisha was still around. I fell in love with the scenery, the costumes and the acting. Ziyi Zhang is one of my favorite actors, she is remarkably beautiful and stands out because of her ethnicity. She was nominated for a golden globe, a sag award and a bafta and yet she missed out on the Oscar nomination. I find this quite unusual because her portrayal of a geisha was remarkable. so what if she is Chinese? we see Australians playing Americans and Americans playing Brit's but why is there so much controversy over a Chinese playing a Japanese. to me, it makes no sense. this film is absolutely astounding and absolutely breathtaking. the cast ensemble which included ziyi zhang, li gong and ken wanatabe was just perfect. li gong was a great supporting actress. she was just great as Hatsumomo, the evil geisha, i think that she deserved an Oscar nomination but once again, we are disappointed. is it because she is an Asian woman that they have not nominated her? i mean, ziyi zhang was nominated for the other main awards but missed out on the Oscar, why!? i wonder..... this is an era where men and women of all different nationalities are making a change in the Hollywood industry and i am proud of that, coming from a family of color. this is the film of the year and deserved more than it got. give this film a chance and go see for yourself what a remarkable film this really is",Memoirs of a Geisha

303,Stefarooh-dbn,Faithful adaptation of the much loved new classic,8,1 June 2006,"I, like the millions out there, was a huge fan of Arthur Golden's book when it hit the shelves. Yes one could criticize it for not truly representing the Geisha life accurately in the tea houses of Japan or for simply being a Cinderella clone set in a Geisha House but I had taken to the story like a fish would to water developing a great love for it as I raced through it. By the end of the book, it had become one of my firm favorites and was on the top of my recommendation lists for all my friends as required reading. It was a few months later that I then heard that Steven Spielberg (having loved the book himself) had purchased the rights and was going to film it. It seemed like a match made in heaven and one that I had begun counting down the days for till its release. However, for years nothing came of it as the project sat in limbo as Mr. Spielberg busied himself with other projects. When the film adaptation was finally announced as on track and certain, I was ecstatic. This was going to be my film of the year. While I was not disappointed, I would have preferred that the film be shot in its original Japanese language with subtitles (problem being that most of the cast were Chinese) that would have given the film a more authentic feel. The film was certainly one of the most exquisitely shot films of 2005 (deserving its Oscar for cinematography) and was overall quite a faithful adaptation of the bestselling book.

Yes, you do need to know the Japanese culture to understand little things in this film, I lived there for a year so I know the proper rituals. I wish that they filmed more of the cityscapes and gardens, Nara is very beautiful, more of this cinematography would have given that romantic flare they were aiming for.

306,carolynpham56,Good movie but the book is better,6,24 January 2011,"This movie has received plenty of bad reviews mostly because of unreasonable opinions and silly preferences people have regarding Asian turned Western movies. People have criticized Memoirs just because of its casting, something I find totally silly and downright stupid. The cast of Memoirs is powerful and I would not have picked other actors myself, even if they were all Chinese.Secondly, coming from a person who loved the book, the movie was very faithful, if not too faithful to the book. Many preconceived expectations abound book adaptations and I guess that is the downfall of the movie. It remained too faithful to the point that the inner texture and spirit of the story was somehow lost. It was not translated well on screen even if it was faithful to the original manuscript which is the book. A good example of an exemplary book adaptation would be the Harry Potter series because even though there where chunks of the original details missing in the movie, the film still preserved the central spirit of the text. Going by this line of script writing and screenplay would have made Memoirs a better movie.As a movie itself, not as a book adaptation, Memoirs was beautifully executed. Every frame was lovely to look at: the flowers, the colors, the sounds, the vision of the Oriental scene was lush and vibrant. The production quality was top-notch but that was it. It may have exuded this mysterious Asian aura but it did not follow through. That is the main downfall of the movie. It was aesthetically pleasing but empty.Acting was superb for the most part. Gong Li was a great Hatsumomo and Michelle Yeoh, though lacking Japanese features, was an exceptional Mameha. Ziyi though, was a bit stoic and unfeeling. The young Chio was adorable though and was a good actress even at a young age.Overall, the movie was okay... Beautiful and Theatric. This is coming from an Asian and a book lover so I guess that makes me more credible?...",Memoirs of a Geisha
307,stevehelium,"Memiors of a ""Geiko-san""?",7,24 December 2005,"Even the title should let most people know that this is not going to be a 100% accurate account of the life of ""Geisha"".I read the book twice, a few years ago. Once before moving to Japan and once while living here. I've been here almost 5 years now (in Osaka, so Kyoto is just a 40 minute train ride away).A lot of the comments here are pretty harsh. Chinese actors playing Japanese characters, the ""soap-opera"" feel that so many feel this film had. Blah blah - this is Hollywood doing what it does - making a film to make money.I don't know anything about the accuracy of Golden's book. It was written by an American who has his own biased views of Japan. But I do believe the book managed to capture a lot of the detail which will probably NEVER be known to westerners about what the life of a Geisha is really like. HOWEVER, how many ""outsiders"" truly know the inner workings and details of ANY culture? And Japan suffers from being one of the most well-known xenophobic cultures in the world.What the film accomplished in a small way, I think, is to let the general population know that there is a difference between a prostitute and a Geisha. Many westerners have the Occupation Era conception of ""Gisha"" engraved in their minds, who WERE primarily prostitutes (Just remember how Pumpkin turns out...) You cannot expect a truly good film about the Geisha to be made until Japan decides to do it, which is not likely (unless they want to set the record straight after this film).Until that time, I say go check this out. The scenery and sets were amazing. My Japanese fiancé thought the entire film had actually been shot in Kyoto until I pointed out that no such ""district"" really exists any more (unless you count Gion or Pontocho, but even going there, you are hard pressed to see a Geisha on the streets).For those that have read the book, you will enjoy a lot of the scenes from the book. I was happy that the film did not sway to far from the novel. At each stage in the film I knew what was going to happen next, but I was still enthralled because I wanted to see HOW they did it.To everyone who has harsh words for this film - well... YOU go make a better one. Expect to get what you pay for - a Hollywood rendering of an American's book about a world that will most likely remain unknown to those of us that were were not either Geisha or wealthy Japanese living in the 30s and 40s. Most Japanese have very little clue about the lives of Geisha either! I'm thankful someone at least TRIED to make this into a film, even if it isn't ""perfect"".It was worth my 1300 yen!Addition: I am watching the film again now and I have to say, as well as the Chinese actresses do, it does in fact detract from the film if you understand the differences. They speak with SUCH Chinese accents it is hard to take the film seriously on a second viewing.How many stars? Give it 5. Golden should have been more picky.",Memoirs of a Geisha

This is a much better film than both Spielberg's blood splattered Munich and Crash which are both up for best picture, and just as good as the other three. I will never understand the way the Oscar nominations are given.

309,EnvyMeWicked,Stunningly Beautiful and packed with unspoken emotions,10,2 December 2005,"Memoirs of a Geisha achieved the highest degree of cinema. It was a moving piece of art put together by people who has a clearly understanding of what they wanted. Director Rob Marshall devours himself into this project and made the book come to live. The costume, the scenery, and the music were all top notch.It's a shame that the studio removed all of Zhang Ziyi's original voice over through out the film, replacing them with an old woman voicing as the grownup Sayuri. I thought Zhang's voice-over would've added more to her character and it would've been easier for the audience to identify and feel for her pain and struggles. Since Zhang Ziyi only enters the film 20 mins into the movie, by removing her voice as the narrator also takes away her credibility as the top billing actor, and all of the sudden she just feel like another actress entering the scene.Michelle's portrayed of Mameha was the most faithful to the book. She carried herself well and she was the easier one to understand. She was the voice of reason and her dialogues often helped the transition of Sayuri's growth and the flow of the movie. Gong Li played Hatsumomo, but her version of Hatsumomo is no where near the conniving witch she is in the book. I guess it might've been too over-the-top if she just starts slapping Sayuri asking for her brooch. Gong Li gave a lot in her performance. The scene where she was walking away from the Geisha house after the fire is one of the best moments in the movie. The look that she gave before she walks away says it all. Zhang Ziyi was great, but she was terribly hard to understand at times. Nonetheless, her facial expression says so much, especially the ending and the scene where she's standing on top of the mountain. Moments that make you feel her pain and her longings.When a movie is so meticulously put together, there's no time to think about the accent or the race of the actors, all there is to do is to enjoy of the phenomenon that are presented infront of your eyes. The movie was journey, one that was worth every second.",Memoirs of a Geisha
310,indigoraven4,this was terrible,3,2 January 2006,"It was beautiful to watch though, other than that the movie was long and boring. I didn't care about any one in the movie cause I was irritated it dragged on forever and a day, I read the book and I am not a stickler to ""oh the movie has to be exact and stuff"", the book pacing was really good and it was a interesting read, and the movie story line was so slow I just couldn't wait for it to be over, it did not carry over any of the charm, but again it was beautiful. I don't know how long the movie was ,but it felt like forever I was angry I wasted my time watching this beautifully costumed and filmed movie yet the story was told so blah that I was so irritated by it. and what was up with the dance, it was cool they should of just said she was preforming, cause when they say lead dancer and the geisha are these elegant, delicate being and she comes out to be the lead dancer and it looks all beautiful she starts thrashing around like some rock and roll groupie at a concert I almost laughed out loud.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Well directed in an amazing Japanese background.Although it is 2.30 hours, you won't be bored. For those who pay attention to detail, you might like to check the music theme in the background.In general, 7.5/10 would make justice to the movie.Attention blockbuster-fans: There is a chance that you are not going to like the movie!

312,arthurbanendera,Not bad,5,20 March 2012,"First, this isn't a typical Hollywood film. Despite popular western misconceptions about Geishas, there's no sex, almost no violence and beyond that, there's nearly two and a half hours of women's problems that many men may find hard to relate to. This is not ""Desperate Housewives"" or even ""All my Children."" This is about deceit, treachery and rivalries as much as it is about a little girl who gets sold into bondage by her impoverished Japanese family. Its also about a lifelong search for love in a society in which people apparently can't just step up and make frank declarations of devotion to one another. This movie is in a word ""complicated"" and that is going to turn some American movie goers off.But not all Asian film fans are raving about this movie either, some thinking it is a very superficial look at Japnese customs and others incensed that a movie that's about an important Japanese tradition should star three Chinese actresses. I cannot comment on either topic, since I know little or nothing about Japanese tradition and I don't know why Ziyi Zhang, Michelle Yoeh and Gong Li were cast. They have been seen before by American audiences, but are hardly film stars in this country, so it wasn't as if they were going to draw in tons of fans on their names alone.The only thing I can think of is, all three are fine actresses and they more than proved that in this film. If Gong Li does not get a best supporting actress nomination, there's no justice. And Zhang should probably get a crack at best actress for her work, as well.All three just light up the screen.But, I can understand in this age of political correctness, how some would be offended by the casting and how others might complain about the handling of the Japanese subject matter.",Memoirs of a Geisha

I plan to watch this movie numerous times. The beauty is a feast for your eyes from the actresses to the setting and the story is like nothing before it.Why did they wait so long to tell a story of Geisha? The wardrobe and hair was second to none. I would love to see these actresses get Academy Awards and the film to get best picture.I can't say enough good about it.

As told by her mother Sayuri is like water, water can carve its way, even through stone and when trapped makes a new Path. Film opens in a unknown village where Chiyo and her sister Satsu forcibly removed from their home. Chiyo is taken care of Geisha's house whereas her sister deemed less attractive sold onto prostitution.She was not born to Geisha , but one day near Sunagawa she met a gentlemen.

She wants to become Geisha and return his favor. And her Journey beginsGeisha are not courtesans, they are not wives . They sold their skills not bodies, she sings, entertained us.

315,peppe80,"Sweet romance packed into an exotic  but Hollywood-taste""  story",8,11 April 2006,"People think: it's a movie for women about the women through the geishas miserable and mysterious life, it cannot be interesting for a man. Or: is there a classical man-woman liaison spiced by the specific Japanese culture? These are true but a bit polarized phrasings. There can be found deeper and valuable elements The main specifies of the film  the charm of the contemporary Japan, the authentic Japanese clothes  make even for a man amuse this womanly"" story. But not only these formalities make this film worth for me. A kind of standoffish emotion influences the most scenes especially after the second part"" of the film. (In this part the little Sayuri has already been grown up, the beautiful Zhang Ziyi plays her role.)Hollywood-style"" & lack of traditional visualization The Japanese mentality  as I wrote about is before  is more measured about the relationships and emotions. In some scenes  for example when the Geisha-house was bursted into flames trough the quarrels of Hajimomo and Sayuri  was too Hollywood-taste"" for me. Probably the English language made me feel this, the original Japanese language would be more authentic. In Japanese can be expressed more hectic and effective, the tone and every piece of word have weighty function. (On the other hand the Japanese-English articulation was better understandable for me, I could enjoy the film almost without reading subtitles.) The other fault: less visualized Japanese tradition than I expected before. I mean the particularly analyzed national background should have been more significant. (Sayuri's main"" dance before the big audience was so powerful, that a chill came over me.) I almost forgot to notice my favorite thing"" in this movie: those rain-like blue eyes. Is there any man who would able to stand against the temptation of them? I watched this film with a girl who has such a great blue eyes like Sayuri had. Yes it's a quite private information from me but why not? This film is about repressed and not repressed emotions and even it's trite but that's the life. And at last but no least: the girl I watched the movie with told me after the film: You don't know how antagonistic could be the relationship among girls/womens."" I agree with it and as well I strengthen this comment: women/girls likely to horn in each private life, jealousy (concerning love or men) is more common among them. I gave 8 points. It's a quite pleasant amusement and you won't disappoint in it",Memoirs of a Geisha

It is about her will to escape and shows how love at an early age derives her life to be a very successful geisha.Human feelings are depicted very well in the movie. Fear, love, jealousy, inspiration, hatred, and love again.It touched me and almost brought me to tears. I would recommend it.The actors were great. I particularly liked the actresses that played Sayuri. Also the one that played the other jealous girl. Don't remember her name in the story. The movie goes with a rather smooth pace. It keeps your full attention during the whole time though. and it was rather long, 145mins.",Memoirs of a Geisha
317,kairanga,I loved the film and the moments - a triumph,8,22 January 2006,"This film may not be true to Japanese Geisha culture or the actors may not be Japanese.But it is a window into Japanese culture and history. And it has been told beautifully and graphically. Film is a dramatized art. This film makes you think. We have a commonly held notion of Geisha, that they are elite call- girls. But there are classes inside the Geisha society. Geisha evolved into an art form. The mystery and the aura is what makes them interesting.Wonderful photography,great scenes, John Williams's spell-binding music and great moments make this a great film. Understandably it is difficult for western audience to understand the psyche of the Japanese mind - honor and shame being the most important of emotions, love relegated to a lower place.I enjoyed this film. It captures a bygone era with a reasonable accuracy.Don't watch this film the way you watch normal Hollywood movies. Take a little time to understand a different culture.",Memoirs of a Geisha
318,arezoucat,Could be improved greatly,5,31 December 2005,"This is an OK movie overall. But I had some serious problems with it that I'll mention here. First of all, there was no really captivating theme music in the score. I think that a movie is only made good when it has a really good score. Second really bad decision on Rob Marshal's part was deciding to have the movie in English. This I thought ruined the whole strength of the story because you can't ever get really into it. I mean, the actors (most of them) are hardly speaking English and it's even difficult to comprehend what they're saying half of the time. I think oriental movies of that time period should be in the original dialect (i.e. Japanese) with English subtitles. The actors and casting was good, I thought. The direction and cinematography was flawless but because of the things I said above, I never felt that this was a movie I have to see over and over again. The one last thing that made it a bit boring was that the childhood sequences were too long and the audience might feel bored at times......",Memoirs of a Geisha
319,tonysoppranose,Beautiful Movie,10,30 December 2005,"Geisha films in Japan are a dime a dozen so it's doubtful this film will be a big hit there.The story is a bit thin but for a period piece of fiction it was pretty accurate historically. Having only watched it once, I didn't see any costume, prop or social mannerisms that were not accurate with the exception of speaking English. Actually there is also Japanese spoken in the film without subtitles which can provide the feeling this is a true Japanese film. The big whoop-de-do over the leads being ethnic Chinese is a non-issue and says more about current Asian sensibilities than anything. The film was culturally sensitive as a whole and as accurate as a period piece can be, remarkable for an American film on pre-war Japan.The scenes of the occupation are hardest to watch with Pumpkin's transformation from Geisha to party girl for the GIs.Overall this movie is eye candy and I'll probably buy the DVD regardless of the less than epic storyline.",Memoirs of a Geisha
320,vw_hk89,Aesthetically pleasing and outstanding performances,8,24 June 2006,"Having found out that 3 of my favourite Chinese actresses would appear as leading characters in this film, I was obviously inclined to read the novel before watching the film. I enjoyed the novel and looked forward to watching the film. And I was not disappointed.The story is set in 1920s Japan. Our protagonist, Chiyo, is sold into a geisha house and antagonised by the head geisha, it is only when an encounter with a complete stranger changes her life and as a result, causes her to harness a forbidden infatuation with himRob Marshall and the crew have shown much care and attention to the aesthetics of the film to ensure that the setting was convincing as a 1920s Japanese town, even at times I completely forgot the film was made in America and not Japan.The costumes were also really beautiful and I would pay just to own one of them.Performances from supporting and leading cast members exceeded my expectations. Suzuka Ohgo; who plays the little Chiyo captures your heart immediately and is just adorable.Zhang ZiYi was an unexpected choice at first but she managed to portray Sayuri well ageing gracefully from the naive and vulnerable age of 15 to a sage early thirties.Watanabe Ken didn't have much screen time which is understandable, but it is a good change to see him play a different character and not a scary sword yielding samurai.Gong Li's Hatsumomo stole most of the film and was by far one of the highlights of the film.Another outstanding performance was from Michelle Yeoh's Mameha, who played a very sage, wise and beautiful geisha which was necessary for the portrayal of Sayuri's mentor. Once again, Williams produces one of the greatest scores of his career after passing up on Harry Potter, though most surprisingly, his score lost to Brokeback Mountain.At first I was disappointed that the film would be made in English and not Japanese as I tend to find it quite cheesy.Kudoh Youki like Zhang was capable of portraying a young 15-year old Pumpkin, but it was later on in the film when Pumpkin becomes a drunk and loose hooker that disappointed me greatly as that was not how Pumpkin was described after the war.Similarly, the scene involving the Baron and Sayuri disgusted me and looked like a rape scene when I saw it.In conclusion, I feel the film is definitely one of the most beautifully shot films of the year and would recommend it to anyone who are fascinated with Japanese culture.",Memoirs of a Geisha
321,kate_lee-movie,A Top-Notch Eye Candy,6,24 November 2005,"Can a group of American men and Chinese actresses render the world of a Japanese geisha? The answer is yes, with stunning beauty  and regrettable flaws.Truth be told, this movie was not as bad as its trailer led me to expect it to be. It had a story to tell (although it crumbles in the end),images to show, and material to present. There were ample displays of exquisite beauty -- the trailing tails of silk kimonos, the subtle allure of hand gestures, and the captivating scene of kabuki dance theater ... On the other hand, the American director was not able to pull the Japanese out of Chinese actresses. (This movie was so crowded by famous Chinese idols that I found myself inadvertently searching for Joan Chen among the cast.) To be fair, all three main actors (Gong Li in particular) show strong performances that made me sympathetic to Rob Marshall's choices. However, they remain utterly Chinese throughout this movie. The look and accent are not the only problems. They lacked the kind of extreme femininity and excessive felicity of the delicately mechanical gesture and movements of traditional Japanese ladies you see in custom dramas of Japanese production. (Michelle Yeoh seems to be the only one trying a little bit of those, but it did not quite work for some reason.)So, let me re-address the question: Can a group of American men and Chinese actresses render the world of a geisha? The answer, I guess, really depends on what you are looking for. If you would like a little bit of delight from an aesthetically pleasing picture with a dubious authenticity and realism, this movie delivers it. I would not say Rob Marshall failed completely. Memoirs of a Geisha is not the first, nor the last, movie that subjects another culture to the crude lens of American exoticism. It definitely is not the worst one.",Memoirs of a Geisha

I really enjoyed the play of Ken Watanabe, I do think that he is brilliant actor, and I am really sorry that I do not have much possibility to see him on the screen. Memoirs of a Geisha appears to be the movie for Western Europeans and Americans. I very appreciate the attempt of the director to show the secret world, which is almost incomprehensible, but I must admit that it is not necessary for us, at least for me, to understand geisha's philosophy. For me the most important thing is to enjoy the world created by Rob Marshall, and I cannot perceive this movie as the correct interpretation of a true life of geisha.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Absolutely loved it. Yes, the accents were a little 'off-putting'. When Zhang Ziyi is speaking with a strong accent and her counterparts sound as if they grew up in LA, it is distracting. The strength of this film in my opinion lies not in the story (though what a great story to tell), nor in the acting, but in the cinematography, costuming, and art direction. It is visually stunning. I literally caught myself catch my breath, the scene at the end for example. The elaborate costumes and insanely vivid colours...I'm making it a point to study Dion's work. This film has done nothing but fuel my desire to make, or at least have some part in making, visually stunning films such as this.

324,eclaire-68264,Memoirs of a Geisha,9,30 March 2018,"Memoirs of a Geisha is a very good movie in my opinion. It first starts off in the countryside of Japan, where a family of four ( two sisters , a mother and a father ) is living in poverty and their mom is very sick . The only way she can get the help she needs is by selling her two daughters to the geisha house to become geisha. When they are sent off to their new place , the older sister is decided by the headmaster to live at a whorehouse to become a prostitute and the younger sister Chiyo who is later given a different name (Sayuri) is kept in the geisha house and must serve in a hierarchy in the household . The movie is full of pain and hardships and Sayuri must learn how to become a geisha and sell herself to the highest bidder. The movie is full of drama and suspense. She has to fight her way through the jealous ness and competitiveness of the other maiko or girls practicing to become geisha in order to become an amazing geisha and work with men or clientele. She falls with a stranger named the chairman who was the only one who showed her kindness when she was little. After she grows up and is the world's most famous and popular geisha she struggles to have a relationship with him and then world war 2 disturbs the peace in Japan and every single geisha and her have to put their profession at rest to stay sheltered . After the war is over Japan has changed and geisha aren't as special as they once were . At the end Sayuri and the chairman fall in love and stay with each other till the end. It's a tragic love story with astronomical boundaries . It's something you can just sit back and watch on a rainy day and admire . It's a very heartfelt movie that you can watch over and over again , and cry over and over again. This is a great movie and I highly recommend it.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Of course, not to mention, the acting which I would like to point out was so convincing that any one who encountered this film would certainly feel the power of those beautiful blue eyes. Also, a film of this caliber should be an eye opener for those film makers who are consistently doing remake after remake after remake.

However, it just took one thing to mess up the whole movie.... the screenplay. Yes the words used in the screen play was so soothing to hear and nice literature style kinda words. But I felt like who ever who did the screen play should improve in adapting a screenplay from a book. Clearly, it was as if they did not sumarize the book into a movie but just took parts of the book and made it into a movie. And the result was major failures such as how deeply Nobu San loved Sayuri was not portrayed in the movie. How hard Mameha was on Sayuri was also not shown very well. The ending kind off sucked too. Too quick. However credits have to be given again for the art point of view in the movie. Great costumes, Great score (Surprise John Williams is not just good in star wars themes), Great make-up, and great sets. I am sure the movie would do well in those categories at the Oscars.Also huge credit to be given out to Zhang Zyi. I am kind of disappointed that she was not nominated for an Oscar for her acting. I certainly thought that Zyi acted better than Keira Knightley. I thought she deserved a nomination at least. For a girl from a non English lingual medium to come up with a great acting in a Hollywood movie, I'm so surprised why she has not been credited for her acting. She also gave me tingles when she did the snow dance. Hats off to Zyi.Also good acting by former bond girl Michelle Yeoh and Gong Li. A great bunch of actors in this movie. I don't know what is the fuss of Chinese girls playing Japanese in a movie. China has banned the movie just because of that, just shows immaturity in the Chinese Censorship Board.

The suffering of Chiyo/Sayuri was heart wrenching. Little Suzuka Ohgo,playing Chiyo, lured me into the film from the beginning. Li Gong fought a battle throughout the film as Hatsumomo, the antagonist. It appeared as if she was in a battle against Chiyo, the reason remains a mystery.

328,HybridCheeseMan,The BEST pre-Munich movie,9,30 March 2006,"Honestly, this is probably the best movie to come out Post-Munich. The story is incredible, the characters are beautiful and engaging. The whole movie is so poetically shot, written, acted, produced. Just a brilliant movie in it's entirety. Now, I do understand the fact that Japan has banned it for political racial issues and there might have been some factual errors in it..but I don't think it outweighs the artistry or charisma of this movie. Honestly, this movie should have been a Best Picture contender over Crash, and if it was, I honestly believe in my heart of hearts that this movie would have won Best Picture, because up against Munich, it stands pretty powerful. No movie on the planet matches it's cinematography, which is the BEST cinematography I have EVER SEEN in my LIFE! No really, in my life. The story was absolutely genius...one of the most touching, real, and innocent love stories ever told.People did have a problem with the English in the movie, but I kind of understand it being used because it took place in a time where America sort of played a super-hero of sorts, and back in the 40's (this is a fact that still applies today) to make it you must know how to speak English, and I think that Marshall figured that having the movie in English sort of represented that importance in other countries. Also what is connected with the English speaking is when the Geisha's meet the Americans and communicate with them, so it all rounds up in the end.Sayuri, I think, is probably the most complex character created. Although Ziyi Zhang's English could be polished...uh...a lot, BUT regardless...this it doesn't take away from her performance much. She is very believable, her expressions are dead on, and every emotion expressed by Sayuri (happiness, sadness, melancholy, excitement, love) is perfect in every way. The building of her character throughout is amazing. You really come to care for this character although she does have her faults, we realize that she is human and she does make mistakes which makes her all the more human. It's very entertaining to watch this character grow and mature throughout her story, and watch her console her faults and try to better herself.The most important thing to get from this film is the rivalry between Hatsumumu (or something) and Sayuri. The contrast between the characters are distinguishable, but there are moments where our heroine brings herself down to Hatsumumu's level. Sayuri does learn some manipulation from her rival, and as Hatsumumu takes in Sayuri's best friend turned rival Pumpkin, it really starts to shine through. The rivalry, jealousy, and deceit shows the immaturity phase that they go through, and as Sayuri grows out of it because it starts to hurt her, Hatsumamu remains as stubborn as she starts, but Marshall makes it so you think the relation might get better as it deteriorates right before your eyes. PURE GENIUS! Pumpkin also has her manipulative traits, and he character is probably just as complex as Pumpkin (contradicting what I said earlier). Pumpkin goes through many visible stages in her life in being a Geisha, sinking to a less of a Geisha and more of a manipulative prostitute. The evolution of these characters is portrayed in the most perfect light imaginable.Sayuri's journey is selfless, which is her most quality attribute. She wants to be a Geisha because of the fact that a nice man showed her one act of kindness, and that one act of kindness inspired her to become a Geisha and find the man she loves. The perfect love story and a story of selflessness and character. This movie is incredibly realistic with dialog, acting, character, story...amazing. This movie is simply amazing.I'm quite surprised the Academy overlooked this movie for Best Picture, and it surly deserved it's place more than the overrated and over-hyped 'Crash' (which will go down as the biggest upset in Oscar history.) Memoirs of a Geisha will go down in history as one of the most beautifully, artfully crafted movies of all time, and will be cherished by people in the future. It's almost unfair to say it comes second to Munich, but I will say it comes to a close tie between the two.See it. It's worth it completely.",Memoirs of a Geisha

It loses some of its credibility, they don't even look Japanes, and that's a shame on such an expensive and well directed movie. Of course people in Japan will have mixed feelings. They have so many good Japanese actresses, why didn't Spielberg choose them? The Japanes I know think that the floating world should remain mysterious and secret! I highly recommend the movie, and to go to Japan and Gion in Kyoto to be inspired... ""The last Samuraj"" had historical errors with the wrong bended and edged swords. Not so many in ""Memoars of a Geisha"" Since my native language not is English it feels strange when they all speak English. As a child she speaks Japanese, why didn't they continue?

The plot is an oscillation of glory and of shame, of gain and of loss. The technical elements never failed to amaze me. Everything from the costumes to the lighting was unblemished in quality.

333,grinlingj,Exhilarating and true,10,10 July 2006,"Unlike a few other « exotic films », such as ""Bab Aziz"" or ""Go, See, and Become"" or worse even ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"", Memoirs of a Geisha is a wise and truthful film, although set against a most foreign cultural background, that of an ""Okiya"", a house where Geishas are trained in their craft.The film offers countless simple and meaningful metaphors, as do people who belong to an authentic tradition.A basic and recurring image is that of water: the eyes of Chiyo as a child, as when she is an accomplished Geisha, are persistently associated with the color of water, a powerful element, as Mameha, her ""elder sister"" or rather coach, reminds us : ""Water can wash away earth, put out fire, and even destroy iron"".Earlier, Chiyo herself says she is like water, will always find a solution: When meeting an obstacle, water shoes patience but gets a way out through the weakest point of the barrage. Water does not shrink from any dangerous spot nor from any plunge, and nothing can make it lose its own essential nature. It remains true to itself under all conditions.And such is the fate of the Geisha, as Chiyo describes it her self, as she matures in her craft (the word Geisha, I understand, refers to a crafts-person, an artist) : ""It is not for Geisha to want. It is not for Geisha to feel. Geisha is an artist of the floating world. She dances, she sings. She entertains you, whatever you want. The rest is shadows, the rest is secret."" Earlier, when Chiyo decides she indeed wants to be a Geisha, Mameha says to her ""Now your are like running water, you want to move fast."" And water seeps again in the later scenes of the film, when tears of joy fill Sayuri's eyes.Many critics praise the aesthetic quality of the film, and indeed they are right: the actresses are strikingly beautiful. And the pictures all stunning. But the real beauty is born from the words that are uttered : in describing the art of Sumo as well as in conversation, the words are like flowers and foliage carefully arranged in a vase.One of the most exhilarating films I ever saw.",Memoirs of a Geisha
334,waldrusso,"An awful story, and a nonsensical portrait of Japanese culture",1,3 August 2007,"The most incredible thing about this movie is that it is actually more about North American culture than Japanese one. In fact, if you change the way people are dressed, the way they look like, and the architecture, it could become a European, American or even Brazilian love story. In other words, this story has as much to do with Japan as Casablanca has to do with Cambodia. In its attempt to speak a ""universal"" language, Hollywood has forgotten that, to make a movie about a different culture, one has to actually know something about this culture. And to understand a culture, is not only to observe the way people dress and talk. This movie created the most absurd portrait of Japanese society. It is actually a story even more incompatible to Japan than James Clavell's Shogun.",Memoirs of a Geisha

337,grayjay,Highly Recommend This Movie!,10,26 December 2005,"We had read so many mixed or negative reviews for this movie, that we almost skipped it. Fortunately we went anyway. This is an amazing production. The sets and scenery are breathtaking. The costumes, especially the kimonos, are spectacular. The storyline is very interesting and educational in the true ways of the geisha. The excellent cast is led by Ziyi Zhang as Sayuri. She is well-remembered for her beautiful performances in ""Crouching Tiger"", ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"". Her emotions are so real and intense. Ken Watanabe, well remembered from ""The Last Samurai"", delivers another memorable performance. Rob Marshall, the director, follows his fabulous ""Chicago"" with another Oscar-caliber movie.

338,Amanni3968,The Film that was drastically changed from the Book!,5,2 May 2007,"When I heard that Memoirs was becoming a film I was ecstatic. I called family members and demanded that they read or re-read the book, and agree on a date to see the movie.When the time came and I paid for my ticket, popcorn, and other assortment of junk and sat down and started to view the film, my disappointment started to set in. Although the costume designs, and the backdrop was beautifully done, the plot lacked several highlights and points from the book.Now books are hard to adapt, but as the scenes kept rolling, and Hatsummomo caused the fire in the house (which did not happen in the film as Sayuri and Mameha followed her around until she snapped and was kicked out of the Okiya); when the Chairman came to the aid of Sayuri and Mameha during World War II (never happened in the book, it was Nobu); when the Americans went to the island(it was a Japanese man who controlled whether or not Nobu and the Chairman received clearance to re-open the plant); and what happened to Nobu's arm-it was suppose to be missing; and another thing, the movie ended so sweet and romantic, but in the book, Sayuri can no longer be a geisha and has to be hidden from Nobu, since the Chairman becomes her ""danna"". Where was this stuff? It just did not appear in the film. I was so disappointed.There was so many intricate and simple details left out of the film, that by the time, the movie was over, my sister and I looked over at each other and were extremely angry.If this was just some other Film, it would be okay, but the Film did not do the book justice.",Memoirs of a Geisha

It is a classic love story, the subtext was the struggle between good and evil. It was epic. The costumes and sets were absolutely gorgeous. I just loved this movie. The actors were amazing. Ziyi Zhang was absolutely perfect as Sayuri. Her portrayal was totally believable. If I didn't know better I would believe she was a real Geisha. For someone that is a home-grown American this was a fascinating subject. To me it is in the same category as movies such as Gone With the Wind and Casablanca. I believe it's truly that good.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Some people were born in an unpleasant condition which for some will help them appreciate little things more. Some people, though, were born in a quite decent or even very delightful situation, but yet some of these people take it for granted the situation.

344,maki124,The less you know....,1,3 January 2006,"Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautifully filmed movie, there is no doubt about that. And the acting is generally excellent, at least in terms of how it portrays the characters as they are scripted.However, so many details small and large are just _wrong_ that it just bothers me too much to be able to enjoy it fully. A small detail that typifies the kind of lack of sensitivity of sorts is one scene (no this does not spoil anything) where Mameha rings a bell that hangs at the door of the house where Sayuri lives, on a snowy winter day. The bell she's ringing is a fuurin, or wind chime - that is only left hanging outside of houses in Japan in the summer! People in traditional Japanese homes didn't have doorbells - they just opened the door and announced themselves. (You may think this is such a trivial detail, but I would equate this to a movie made about America where a Christmas wreath is hanging on the door in July and no one thinks anything of it.) And don't even get me started on the totally wrong hairstyles given to the maiko and geisha, which is vaguely pan-Asian/Chinese/kung-fu-ish, and nothing like real thing. I think this rather cavalier attitude towards the culture they are trying to portray really comes out in the attitudes and the portrayals of people and situations too. So, I suppose that the less you know about Japanese culture and the world of the geisha and maiko in Kyoto (which is what ""Miyako"" is), then I suppose the more you will enjoy this. I honestly think this movie could have been so much better...as it is, it's just another Hollywood version of ""exotic Japan"".",Memoirs of a Geisha
345,Nazimova23,"The best film I've seen all year, and I've seen some great films.",10,14 December 2005,"This is the most unfairly maligned film of the year. Some critics took it upon themselves to be the defenders of Japanese culture (without fully researching their arguments) and, in the process, betrayed their own racism. ""The film is inauthentic because the actresses do not wear matronly bouffants,"" one said. Riiiiiight. Matronly bouffants are a Western stereotype! But in any case, some of them do and some don't! THAT'S authenticity. I guess critics wouldn't know that writing reviews without seeing the film or walking out long before it's over (some, such as Jeff Wells, do).Anyway, it's a fantastic film and more than deserving of multiple Academy award nominations - which it may not get thanks to the fact that so many people decided they wanted to use the film as the sacrificial lamb for a half-baked debate about international politics, rather consider that pan-Asian casting for major roles is NOTHING new (it's true of House of Flying Daggers, The Joy Luck Club and even Crouching Tiger) and that this film's production might represent international cooperation at its best.Look out for Gong Li and Youki Kudoh in RICHLY developed supporting roles. The supporting males, while obviously not as well developed since they spend less time in the geisha quarters, still give incredible performances. Ken Watanabe was excellent, but I particularly enjoyed the performance of the actor playing Nobu. Oprah is right about the sets and costumes; they (amongst other things) make you want to savor every moment of the film. Some people have argued that the brilliant colors make it seem like some sort of Orientalist fantasy. Truth is that this would only be the case if we saw a departure from a more sedate West to a flamboyant East; instead, the film opens in a rather sedate part of Japan and then takes us to the more colorful geisha district (which introduces this fascinating paradox of great suffering in a milieu of tremendous beauty). We know from Chicago that it's simply Rob Marshall's aesthetic to make everything the height of beauty, even if it's a slum. God forbid ENTERTAINMENT CIRCLES should be presented as visually spectacular! The film is by turns funny, moving and, yes, thrilling. Gasps in the audience for the film's third act gave way to sniffles. Ziyi Zhang really managed any language difficulties well; her face has this ripple effect when she's emoting. It's stunning to behold. If I were voting for the Oscars, I'd definitely give her a nomination at the very least. And homegirl can dance, too! Her performance and the film itself are not boring at all; audience members laughed when she was trying to be funny and sighed when she was suffering. IMO, too much happens in the film for it to get boring; there's a strong balance between the rivalries, the details about geisha entertainment and the romance. In the final scene, it all comes full circle. I won't tell you how. See for yourself.My #1 film of the year. Brokeback Mountain, Chronicles of Narnia, Howl's Moving Castle, King Kong and Grizzly Man aren't far behind.",Memoirs of a Geisha
346,jayro,Although surface...beautiful in every way,7,27 December 2005,"I was pleasantly surprised coming out of ""Geisha."" I had heard numerous mixed reviews and was skeptical. However, what I experienced was 2 and half hours in an exotic world floating on silk. True, the film is not complex or deep, or probably very true to the life of a real geisha. But, I don't know if that's what I really wanted. I was content with Rob Marshall's musicality in his directing to create a meditative and intriguing melodrama. Oddly, the story reminded me of Chinese spoken drama, which was written around the time the movie takes place. Also, John Williams score is worth two stars alone. The actors all created compelling performances even though the characters on paper lacked depth. I recommend ""Geisha"", not because it's an important film...but because there is beauty in virtually every frame, everything else in the film is shadow.",Memoirs of a Geisha
347,lance-grode,vastly overrated,4,6 December 2005,"This movie reminded me of ""Road to Perdition""; take a small story and then try to paint it on a huge canvass--in the process losing the entire impact of the story. This movie, much like ""Perdition"" makes spectacle the centerpiece and reduces the story to a vehicle to stage beautifully choreographed and photographed scenes. Not once did I ever feel connected to the characters. I am not a fan of spectacle movies, at least where the result is to remove the viewer from caring about what happens to the people the movie is about. While no one can dispute the acting abilities of the great Gong Li and the next great Chinese actress, Zhang Ziyi, their lack of facility with English hurt their performances. I also felt that the failure to have any nuance in the Gong character was a mistake in both screen writing and directing. Ultimately, the movie is long and boring. And, without an investment in the characters, seemed even longer.",Memoirs of a Geisha
348,strawberrystarness,"""A story like mine should never be told..."" but it was a pleasure to hear it!!",8,23 December 2005,"I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed Memoirs of a Geisha when I read the book. This movie brought many of the scenes to life, adding in one new one that contributed to the drama. The movie did a decent amount of justice to the characters in the book by Arthur Golden.Although many things were left out of this movie, which happens with every movie that you turn into a book, it was very well done. John Williams did a beautiful job with the score, and the sets were elaborate and beautiful. There were a few technical aspects of the costuming and makeup that were wrong, but one would only notice if they were well versed in the culture of the geisha. If all you know about Geisha is that they wear white make-up and kimono, then you shouldn't have a problem with the minor details of the costuming and make up. They are both delightful, even if they are wrong in some circumstances.As being one who does not know the difference between the Asian actors (meaning if they are Chinese, Japanese...etc), I thought they all did a wonderful job of portraying the characters. The actors and actresses bring the characters from Golden's book to life.It was a delightful movie. I highly suggest it to everyone to see. There is romance, drama, a touch of comedy, and a look into the world of the Geisha. Although, it is only a tiny glance, as the world of the Geisha is much more complex than anyone could ever imagine, it brings this secret world of Kyoto to life.",Memoirs of a Geisha
349,bloomingvinedesign,The Art Of LOVE and Sacrifice,10,2 February 2016,"Set in early twentieth century Japan, the life and lure of Geisha and it's history is explained through the most tragic of circumstances. As an outsider in the US, a viewer takes home cultural identities that contradict most prior knowledge of the culture, mystification, and history of Geisha. While Geisha still exist today, the process is different. It means something to Japan. In the US, 'geisha girls' are a derogatory term. This movie shows the full stages of early twentieth century initiation through diabolical means. It shows an undercurrent happening even with the Geisha community. The time was dark. The Geisha served as escorts, mainly, for those in political power. Only some Geisha were permitted to have regular followers. Some Geisha were auctioned off. Some Geisha were truly in Love. Once you swallow the horror of the arrival of adolescence in a place in the dark history, the entire movie is a love story.There were people and guides with this Geisha-dreamer-girl, her whole life. The first guide, she found herself, as a little girl. He thought she reminded him of a young, abused Geisha attendee, however, he told her he was reminded of him children.The shaved ice cup, in the town scene, is the most crucial thing in the entire movie. She bases the rest of her life, where she places her trust, and whom she seeks to hide it from, on that single moment--when she saw HIM- (Ken Wanatabe) and his Geisha.Rivalries spring up, and collapse over the course of time. However the ART begins to inspire. Art becomes the universal truth that gets this lowly little child, from the hell she was dragged through, to the Love she seeks. The epic journey is told with the most brilliant costumes, sets, cinematography, and casting. Everyone in this movie was an artist. Despite war, misinterpretation, language barriers, and culture shock, this movie bridges a serious gap between worlds...as artists, people, friends. Not many remember why the cherry trees bloom here too. We need movies like this. We Are one world, with many tragedies, and Many many more artists.",Memoirs of a Geisha

351,Imaginista,Chinese actors? Joey Wang!,1,25 November 2006,"It is not that Chinese actors can' play sensuous hyperfeminine Japanese geishas, it's that the casting directors were just too lazy or too blind, selecting what sold at the market at that moment (Gong Li, Zhang Ziyi) representing the booming Chinese economy, and Michelle Yeoh, representing the rich overseas Chinese communities in HK, Southeast Asia, Singapore, Taiwan, Canada, US.Actually CASTING is an art itself and in the film, the CASTING FAILED MISERABLY. Zhang Ziyi is too brash and insensitive to play a sensitive role. She is utterly unconvincing.Joey Wang would be perfect for this role as Hatsumono...but it would be a hard to find a Sayuri. I would rather they cast an unknown Japanese because Japanese femininity and Chinese femininity has diverged since the Cultural Revolution and Communism in China which eliminated all feudal values including feudal Femininity. Feudal Chinese notions of Femininity are closer to Japanese notions of Femininity whereas modern womanhood embraced by Zhang Ziyi are closer to American feminism.Zhang Ziyi could play a Feminist but not a sex slave. She looks to much like the sexual predator to be hunted. It is totally unconvincing as a geisha. You know right from the start she is just a teaser for money, not the real deal.",Memoirs of a Geisha

There were a few things that very much detracted from the authenticity of the movie. First, I had expected a Japanese tone to the movie...that is, Japanese language and Japanese actors. I realize now this is just an American (Hollywood) movie and the casting and poetic license taken by Mr. Marshall spoiled it. Although the Chinese ladies did a good job in acting their parts, none of them could capture the Japanese heart (psyche).

353,msmuse101,Why the bad reviews?,9,15 January 2006,"I watched the film a couple of hours ago and had been looking forward to it for a few months now. But after reading reviews and comments about the film the other day I was a bit concerned that the film was going to be a disappointing flop. I'm glad to say that the reviews, in my opinion were completely wrong. I can understand that you might be disappointed if you looked at the cast and thought ""Yay a cool martial arts flick"" and then found it to be a drama with no fight scenes what so ever, but knowing what it was going to be like I was gob smacked. The film looks breath-taking and even though my main concern was that they were speaking English and not Japanese after five minutes of getting into the film you can forgive and forget that. As for the actors themselves, allot of people have been complaining about the fact that they are Chinese, but this like the language is easily forgotten as you become immersed in the fantastic storyline and scenery. I thought the acting was great and you get to see a side to Zhang Ziyi's acting that she doesn't really show in previous films, Michelle Yeoh's portrayal of Mameha was awesome and she plays the strong, in control woman figure that she's played so well before, Ken Watanabe as the chairman was a great choice and gave a very good performance and Gong Li was very impressive in her role of Hatsumomo. I was particularly impressed with the young girl, Suzuka Ohgo who played the young Chiyo. She not only looked very convincing as Zhang's younger self, but her acting was fantastic.If you wanted to see this film but have been but off by the critics and bad reviews, ignore them. Go watch it and form your own opinion. I loved it and think it's going to be tough to beat this as my own personal film of the year.

I've lived in Japan for 5 years & my partner is Japanese. I'm no cultural expert but I am more aware of the differences between Asian cultures than the typical Hollywood moviegoer for whom this film was tailored. Of course I had my doubts about this film & there have been many discussions about it on this site already, so I won't explore that further here. Most importantly, I came out of the theatre emotionally satisfied. Of course this movie isn't an accurate, factual, historical drama. It's a fantasy world. Of course one could complain that the hair, make up and costumes don't reflect the true geisha aesthetic. But again...it's a fantasy. Much like a movie musical from Hollywood's past. However, I was touched & so was my partner and the middle-aged Japanese couple beside me were both sobbing into their handkerchiefs during the final scene.

It was very true to the book, and even when they changed things around, it made sense and went along smoothly. Everything about the movie was beautiful. The actors and actresses were very good, so I'm not sure what some people mean by them 'lacking emotion', particularly the character of Sayuri. I did feel her sorrow, and I think most people with me in the theater did as well. The music, scenery, dancing, costumes, and makeup were beautiful. A lot of people are too judgemental about the movie not being historically accurate enough. But it is only a movie, not a documentary. I know a thing or two about geisha, and the movie was fine in terms of the history. Nothing too dramatically wrong, and I watched it as a movie, and it was lovely. The only things I didn't really like were the scenes during the war, which I thought didn't explain the war enough, and altogether, there was barely an emphasis on the war. It was like Sayuri just got to the kimono-making place, and she was back in Gion on again within minutes. Another thing was how she didn't look convincingly older by the end of the movie, but she should be. But aside from these, the movie was great. And there were quite a number of people watching, and it was only the first matinée. There were about 40 people in the whole theater, which is quite impressive. You can imagine how many people will be there for the evening show.I definitely recommend watching the movie. I don't see what is so bad about it!",Memoirs of a Geisha
357,lizzie1708,A visual & dramatic feast,9,25 June 2006,"I read Memoirs of a Geisha last year and was instantly captivated by the story, so was equally excited & hesitant that a film was being made, as I've seen so many good books being butchered at the cinema. Thank God this one wasn't! I'd heard a lot of comments about the casting choices, but I went in with an open mind & it didn't disappoint. I was very impressed with all the acting; the actress playing the young Chiyo lights up the screen and helps us to connect with Zhang when she takes over the role. Zhang gives a subtle & heartrending performance as Sayuri that is astonishing, especially for someone who didn't speak English before filming started. Yeoh displays a regal elegance & quiet intensity that you would expect and portrays the epitome of geisha to perfection. All I can say about Li Gong is; WOW! She is truly remarkable as the spiteful, bitter rebel geisha who challenges Sayuri at every turn, & her face in the fire scene says it all; a woman who has tried to be a perfect geisha, but snaps in her inability to deal with such immense pressure. Ken Watanabe is truly perfect for the role of the Chairaman, he is just how I imagined the Chairman to be. Standout scenes for me: the first meeting between the Chairman & Chiyo, the attack by the Baron on Sayuri, the fire scene, the ultimate betrayal of Sayuri by Pimpkin (even though I knew what was coming, I still gasped, as did everyone in the cinema) & the final scene that brings the two characters together. The cinematography is exquisite,the costumes stunning, and the music haunting. Overall, a poignant love story but also a tale of human struggle that everyone can relate to, that transfers to the screen in a gorgeous fashion.",Memoirs of a Geisha
358,givewayaddress,Loved it in Japan,10,30 April 2006,"Best film I've seen in years, very much a revisit to the way films-- romances in particular-- were made in the Golden Age of Hollywood. The story is told entirely in subtlety, and passion burns quietly and for years, all motives played out in the quietest of ways, quite true to the Japanese way. There was a lot of criticism about the Chinese actresses hired for these parts, and while it is clear to the trained eye that they are not Japanese, they all did beautifully in capturing the essence of Japanese culture. Having lived in Japan for years now, I feel qualified in saying the film was extremely well-done and really showed a great deal of Japanese culture that remains true even today. Every time I went to the theaters here, this show was filled, I think the Japanese are an interesting mix of being both secretive, even among themselves, about their ways, and having a strong desire to be loved and appreciated by the world. Despite the Chinese leads, I get the impression they were quite pleased with the film.Highly recommend this film, personally I could watch it over... and over... and over... just sumptuous in every way from the cinematography, costumes, and set design to the acting and the writing. Thought it was pretty much a perfect film.",Memoirs of a Geisha

I have not read the novel yet but this film truly was a masterpiece. There is plenty of amasing scenery and splendidly complex sets and costumes. It truly is a visual work of art, just like a Geisha.The acting of the perfectly selected cast was splendid, flawless. You are whisked into the life of a young girl who is sent away by her sick parents to have a better life. She goes to a city where she is adopted into a Geisha house where she is to grow up and become a Geisha while her sister is taken away to be a prostitute. Some scenes towards the beginning of the film where she meets the Chairman induce an eerie sense of euphoria.The film explores the whole life of a Geisha through the late 1930's into the late forties before and after World War II. The passion, the fury and the feuds between the Geisha provide this film with what it takes to truly be a five star film. The life of a Geisha is very interesting.The film is spectacular and truly does cause you to fall in love with it. It feels a lot like a chick flick and if your solely into action and horror and all those burly men films then this isn't for you but if your into good, excellently made films this is just excellent. The Japanese people had such a rich history and interesting culture which I find just fascinating and this film does this history and the novel much deserved justice.",Memoirs of a Geisha

I have seen all three of the (past) Oscar contenders (Finding Neverland, Aviator, Million Dollar Baby) and Memoirs of a Geisha wins, BY FAR. For those of you who say that this movie is all just nice scenes and costumes. Yes, you're right - the scenes ARE extraordinary and the costumes are magnificent BUT the plot is very true to the book (except for the fire) although they cut out some parts of the book - they were minor parts so it wasn't a problem. Which means the story is AS beautiful as the scenes and costumes (if not more). I was really surprised by Gong Li's acting - my friend told me that Gong Li's acting wasn't that great before - so that kind of proves how much effort went into this movie. Please do not think of this review as being ""biased"" because there is no need for a review for MoaG to be biased - it just simply beautiful.",Memoirs of a Geisha

The sets and scenery are brilliant. The one thing that still bothered me was the incorrect maiko and geisha hairstyles. I think they could have done that properly and didn't need to enhance the actresses faces. I also found the pronunciations of certain words grinding.

I haven't seen this film yet - have visualised it in my mind - its beautiful - A film like this should be made with the sensitivity of Shawshank Redemption - understated but powerful. Even a great film like Shawshank didn't do too well at the box office but hey its endured and is in my view one of the greatest. Up there with Coppolas godfather. Yeah they sometimes make great films from books. However to be honest i read those books after i saw the film. The director seems to come from dance and the actors action figures - - i pray there is little dance and 2 minutes action. I wonder. It will also be interesting to see how they unfold the narrative. ps anyone know how one could get a ticket for the premiere in London??? send us one please???,Memoirs of a Geisha
364,thomas-tammy,Breathtakingly beautiful,10,19 May 2006,"""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is breathtakingly beautiful, everything, from its players, costuming, scenery are all amazing pieces of art. What an interesting look at a society so foreign to this Texan's eyes, to imagine that there was a true geisha society, held in place by such rigid codes of tradition, behaviour and dress, that these women devote their lives to being living works of art, awes and amazes. I have been fascinated with geisha ever since my father brought a geisha doll home for me from his time in the service. This movie brings her to life.I hope those who view this movie will simply pause to appreciate the moon cast shadow of the lives of these delicate,intriguing world of women.",Memoirs of a Geisha
365,alenahagen,Geishas a la Hollywood,3,3 February 2006,"This movie is supposed to be based on a book - well, they have nothing in common but word geisha. It would be OK if there is at least some inspiration by real geishas world, twinkles of reality in pink tasteless soup of unreal content. Alas - movie from beginning till the end is based on what is supposed to excite viewer. It is from the beginning constructed on premise ""what might be more exciting?"" until at the end it is just an empty flock which is not even done nicely. For instance ""geisha's dance is awful not only for any Japanese but even for European... I am pretty shocked that it is even nominated for Academy Award...but I guess it is not exception for Hollywood. Still usually movies have some positive qualities for that honor. Shame, there was everything there - subject, story,, money...and at the end of the day all was lost. Alena",Memoirs of a Geisha
366,knwdwlf,Memoirs...An amazing experience,10,4 March 2006,"Prior to seeing Memoirs, we knew nothing about the movie or the book. My husband happened to see a commercial and recognized Ken Watanabe. Knowing that I held a high regard for Ken, my husband took me to see the film. We were both so moved by this film. It was an amazing experience. The storying telling was incredibly sincere and enlightening. The dance scene was intense, inspiring and artistic. By the end of the movie it was all I could do not to weep for the love and the loss that was experienced through the characters in the film. After seeing Memoirs, I devoured the book in a weekend, and am looking forward to reading it again. Although Memoirs is a very different film from ""The Last Samurai,"" they both show a culture rich in thousands of years of tradition that is forced to adjust to a swiftly changing world; a culture which tries above all to be honorable.",Memoirs of a Geisha
367,blackeyedpeasyall,"Riveting, spellbinding and inspiring!",10,1 April 2006,"Being American, at first, I thought I wouldn't understand much of the film due to the poor advertisements. The commercials were short and although very beautiful the speaking parts were swift and almost intelligible. But, I was determined to see this movie if for nothing else, the amazingly fluid dances. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the dialog didn't hinder my ability to understand what was being said. I was expecting a ""Cinderella"" type story and have seen other comments also suggesting that as well and honestly, I didn't think that that description applied at all. I don't think the omission or replacement of some traditions hurt this movie at all, but I do suggest doing a simple search for the full details of Geisha. The personal triumph, exquisite beauty and of course the dance make this movie worth seeing over and over again.",Memoirs of a Geisha
368,rondoss,Visually stunning; haunting soundtrack.,9,29 April 2006,"Despite its grim beginnings, this film distinguishes itself by its sheer visual beauty (Academy awards for cinematography, art direction, and costume design) and original music (Golden Globe Award). Some of the scenes--shot in Japan--are of such breathtaking artistry, that they alone make the movie worth owning. The dance sequences, for example, are sheer poetry. In addition, the central character--flawlessly acted in both childhood and adult ages--has a force of will and determination that leave me feeling inspired. I must confess I did find myself wishing the editing had been a bit more severe--especially toward the end of the film. At the same time, I would have like more delineation of the male side of the protagonist's romantic interest. Overall, it is the artistic and esthetic force of this film that carries it.",Memoirs of a Geisha
369,zorgclyde,"Beautifully shot, emotionally empty",6,22 April 2006,"So many reviews of this movie focus on the ethnicities of the actress that the movie itself doesn't get the spotlight. I am going to skip the part which everyone already knows, that the 3 main actresses are Chinese (which in my opinion doesn't really matter since geisha is already a dead culture, one that modern Japanese cannot really relate to anyhow), and focus on the acting and direction Marshall has given. In terms of the plot line the script adheres surprisingly close to the novel. However, the dialogue sounds a bit ridiculous. I am not sure why the scriptwriter decided to reduce a superbly written novel into broken phrases, something reminiscent of Victorian theatrical/soap opera language. The patchy dialogue was not helped by the fact that two of the main actresses, Gong Li and Zhang Ziyi, do not possess full mastery of English. In terms of acting, Gong Li was perhaps the most memorable, making best of the disservice the script does to her character. In the novel the character was vindicative yet alluring, but here she just seems weirdly bitter and jealous. Nevertheless, the film resonates the most when Gong Li tumbles down her hair and the picture seethes with her anger. Michelle Yeoh plays surprisingly capablely as a geisha, something I did not expect from watching her action films. Pumpkin was also memorable, giving the movie the vitality it desperately needs. Zhang Ziyi, however, was a sore disappointment. Although there were moments of acting (when she was sobbing) most of the time she looked as staid and plastic as the masks in the movie. From the movie alone I would not understand why anyone would pursue such a boring and uncaptivating geisha. While the aesthetically beautiful, the movie lacks the flow of the novel and the emotional longing throughout the book. Part of it may be that the movie was so hung up on presentation it missed the storytelling. It also lacks a central tying theme, which in the novel of Sayuri's narrative. Here you're not sure whether the movie is about Sayuri, geishas, or Japanese history. While never straying away from the source, the movie never exudes the seduction and allure of the novel, but instead presenting it instead like a photo album.",Memoirs of a Geisha
370,vecchi-1,as Japanese as a cowboy hat,1,10 May 2006,"This is a silly, fake, deadly boring movie, packed with western clichés and Chinese actors. Fittingly, the movie was scripted, directed and interpreted by people who are not Japanese and whose knowledge of Japanese culture, history and mentality is clearly superficial, to put it mildly. The sophisticated photography makes the futility of the whole endeavour even more apparent. In the whole movie there isn't a single moment blessed with the grace and lightness of a real geisha. I am usually a devoted admirer of Zhang Zi Yi, whom I knew as a great actress. After seeing her performance here, I suggest she picks her roles more carefully in the future.",Memoirs of a Geisha
371,ayeshakapadia,my opinions and close analysis of certain parts of the movie.,8,14 May 2006,"""She paints her face to hide her face. Her eyes are deep water. It is not for Geisha to want. It is not for geisha to feel. Geisha is an artist of the floating world. She dances, she sings. She entertains you, whatever you want. The rest is shadows, the rest is secret"" Set in a mysterious and exotic world which still cast a potent spell today, the story begins in the years before World War II, when a Japanese child was torn away from her penniless family to work as a servant in a geisha house. Despite a treacherous rival who nearly breaks her spirit, the girl blossoms into the legendary geisha. Beautiful and accomplished, she captivates the most powerful men of her day, but is haunted by her secret love for the one man beyond her reach.""A story like mine should never be told. For my world is as forbidden as it is fragile. Without its mysteries, it cannot survive. I certainly wasn't born to the life of a geisha. Like so much in my strange life, I was carried their by the current."" Underneath the surface of the film, there are many layers, after layers, after layers of meaning and mystery. Our destiny can be altered by: an outside force; a person; a word; an action; a thought; or a deed. Like a stone thrown into a pond, a small thing sends out many ripples. One small thing can set many consequences, many actions out in front of you.To a girl, her true journey started after she met a young man who showed her kindness when she thought all was lost; at a time of loneliness, a time of grief, when all seems hopeless that one day she would become what she most desire, a ray of hope shined her way when she met the most kind person, anyone could meet: the chairman played by Ken Watanabe on that little bridge. And since that day onwards, we follow that little girl, walking alongside of her down a path, experiencing her journey of becoming a geisha.The very word geisha means artist, and to be a geisha is to be judged as a moving work of art.What caught my attention while watching the movie was a close-up shot of Sayuri played by Zhang Ziyi; but in most particular, her bluish-grey eyes. It was not the usual brown or black eyes that all Japanese citizens have. Her mother used to say to her 'her element is like water' and if you stare at the blueness of her eyes, you feel as if you're watching the ocean, a collection of water.However, I believe that Hutsumomo, played by Gong Li was the most outstanding actress, whose performance was phenomenal. Gong Li plays the evil character, in contrast of the lonely girl Sayuri, and I'm sure you'll agree, that when you watch this film, her appearance, her dialogue, the tone of her voice, the emotion of her face and the body language connects with us as audience compared to Zhang Ziyi's performance. But like I said before, the characters they play are opposite each other.Set in pre-war Japan, Directed by Rob Marshall of Chicago, from the famous writer Arthur Golden in 1997, this is Memoirs of a Geisha.",Memoirs of a Geisha
372,yumeoibito,"So many questions? So little time? Don't worry, I got it covered!",10,7 July 2006,"I've read the book, although it was after seeing the movie. I admit, there are a lot of differences, but all-in-all, the movie was faithful enough to the book. I mean, it's Hollywood, they are bound to change something, it's always going to happen. It's just to prevent the movie from lasting four hours or more.I know, I'm not Japanese, so I don't know how their culture really was then and now, but from my point-of-view, I thought it was not only faithful to the book, but to the culture, and history. The history is told from a different point of view. The story begins in the 1920s.Chiyo Sakamoto lives in a ""tipsy"" house, so named because of the fact that it looks like it is about to fall over. She is special because of her blue eyes. In the Japanese culture, almost all of them have black or brown hair and brown eyes, so you can see why it would be such a big deal. Blue eyes are very rare.She lived with her father (a fisherman), sickly mother, and older sister. Of course, they live in one of the poorest cities in the area. Chiyo plays wit her friends a lot as well as help with chores and care for her sick mother. Soon, that all changes, when her and Satsu, (her older sister), are sold. This is because, their father was getting too old to care for them, and their mother was on the verge of death.They are separated from each other by where they live, even though they live in the same city. Chiyo and Satsu were taken to the city of Gion. Chiyo in the Kyoto section, and Satsu elsewhere. Chiyo soon finds the struggle of becoming a geisha.Some people think that a geisha is a ""sophisticated prostitute"". That is not true. As Memeha (Chiyo's mentor) says, ""A geisha does not sell her body, but her talents."" A geisha is actually an artist, for that is what geisha means literally.Because of this newfound goal, Chiyo works extremely hard to reach it. Along the way she makes friends and enemies. Pumpkin, (so called because of her very round face) starts off being a very good friend of Chiyo's. Hatsumomo, on the other hand, is one of the top Geisha in the Gion district. She values herself highly and despises Chiyo. Hatsumomo has a horrible hatred of her which we later find out is actually jealousy.Can Chiyo's new dream come true? Will she ever see her sister again? Will she and Pumpkin stay life-long friends or will they betray one another? If you have more questions, then read the book and/or see the movie. I've only seen the movie once, but I can guarantee you that you will love it. Not only for the Cinderella type lining, but also for the acting, the actors, the scenery, and the music. It is the best movie I have ever seen. There are just no words to describe it. Don't judge it until you have seen it, but I hope my review has helped.",Memoirs of a Geisha
373,andy_v_belgium,An oriental love story,8,2 August 2007,"Having read the book by Arthur Golden before watching this movie, I have to admit it left me with somewhat of an empty stomach in the end. Golden's novel has a dual intent: teaching, by explaining every step a girl goes through before she becomes a geisha and entertaining, by adding a love-story plot with a nice romantic happy ending.To my personal disappointment, the movie mostly emphasizes on that second part. Many of the interesting details of the process to becoming a geisha have been left out. I am thinking of moments at the geisha school, the details about kimonos and hair, the importance of the debt a geisha has towards the Okiya, etc.Some adjustments were also made to adapt it to the big screen, like e.g. the Nobu character, whom in the book has only one arm and is disfigured all over his body. In the movie only his face shows some discolored spots. Even the diary that Chiyo keeps about her hidden love (the president) and the other people from the Okiya, which was in fact the true reason for the fight with Hatsumomo, was left out. And the fact that in the movie it is the president that saves Sayuri from the war (and not Nobu like in the novel) also made me raise my eyebrows.But I suppose turning over 450 pages into a 2 hour movie and still keep a large audience entertained isn't an easy task to accomplish. Memoirs of a Geisha is most certainly not a bad movie, on the contrary. The acting is very strong and the casting tremendous (although most actresses are Chinese and not Japanese). This movie asked for beautiful woman, and with Ziyi Zhang as Chiyo/Sayuri and Li Gong as Hatsumomo (who from my eyes looked even more beautiful than her adversary) this was more than accomplished. The images really take you back to the Gion of the 40's. They give you a true feeling of what was going on at the time and how it all changed because of the war.So I could conclude in saying that this is a movie you have to see if you are interested in a nice but strong oriental love story. If however you want to learn about geisha's, then I would advice you to read the Arthur Golden novel, which contains much more details. But it was a very enjoyable movie nonetheless.",Memoirs of a Geisha
374,worthj1970,Should have been simpler,5,26 December 2005,"My main criticism is choice of actors. I won't go into small details of the film that I found inaccurate (and there are several). But the issue I have is with the language of the film. If you're doing an English film, choose actors who can perform with solid, fluent, un-coached English; the dialogue of the film often sounded forced and melodramatic. The obvious solution would have been to do the film in Japanese; I know the argument that the book was in English, but the story is in Japan, and if you're going to hire foreign actors you might as well do it in a foreign language. The production would have cost less and would have been more profitable in the long run, possibly even an academy award contender. The dialogue and direction otherwise was good; it was just the choice of language that was central to the movie's failure.",Memoirs of a Geisha
375,sarangdotcom,Epic Fail....,4,10 May 2011,"compared to the book. There was just so much detail that was left out from the book. It was to a point to where I felt as if the movie was too rushed. It almost seemed like a completely different story. The final scene with the Chairman had bits and pieces missing, Nobu was a very big part of the book, but he seemed unimportant and character-less in the movie. The bidding for Sayuri's mizuage was against the Baron and Dr.Crab, but it skipped right over and the Baron's importance was lost. The artist who made sayuri's popularity increase was also disregarded. The eyes seemed to have been a different color and lacked importance. The character build up from when she was taken to the Okiya to the point where she becomes an apprentice seemed like it was only about 20 minutes long. In the book, it was pretty much half of it. I could go on forever about how much was missing from the movie. It just seemed too vivid of a book to be crammed within a 2 hour period of time. They should have left it alone as a book, because I absolutely loved the book. The movie did not give it justice and even pushed some people away from reading the book. BUT I would like to recommend that every body at least read this book. I for one do not buy books often. I usually just go to the library. but this was a book i thought was worth buying.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Yet ""The Godfather"" is considered by many to be one of the best films ever made! I believe ""Memoirs"" is not far behind, in its own way, with gorgeous and splendid if inauthentic costumes, captivating sets, fabulous music, and fine, if understated acting.

The actresses had to go through geisha boot camp just to prepare for this movie and i must say that they have done an absolute great job!I feel this movie is underrated! Wonderful acting and beautiful storyline... My favorite movie ever,,,..But not only that, the child actresses did an amazing job. Not only did they show the pain in which they experienced when being sold to the geisha house, they also showed the curiousness they had to the geisha world despite how much they missed their family. The thing i enjoyed most about this movie is the bond between Mameha and Sayuri as sisters. Mameha came to her not on her own accord but because of the chairman but yet as time passed she and Sayuri grew close and they became really like sisters...However, this movie also depicts the back stabbing part of the geisha world..How pumpkin turned against Sayuri and how Hatsumomo will stop at nothing to be the best Geisha in her era...Yet the show just captivates it's viewers and I must say that the actresses and actors and all involved in the movie have done one of the best movies in this century..despite all the negative criticism, Memoirs of a Geisha transports viewers from the usual action packed shows to a world more beautiful and mystical than ever imagined",Memoirs of a Geisha
378,mmmgrrrl,Memoirs of a Geisha : Does not live up to grand Chinese film tradition,5,1 February 2006,"After months of being too busy at work, I finally saw 'Memoirs of a Geisha' . Having been completely enraptured by 'Wo hu cang long' (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), 'Ying xiong'(HERO), and 'Shi mian mai fu'(House of Flying Daggers), I was expecting to experience that magic that is unique to Chinese films. Mind you, I've seen none of the recent award shows and did not know either the director or producer of Memoirs. I was there to see the actors. I was there to experience Chinese film-making. Throughout the movie, I had this strange sense of disappointment. But I remained hopeful, waiting for the magic. The nuance seemed to be missing, the representation of the period and the mystery of the Geisha seemed forced and imitative. * teeny spoiler start * The solo dance performance by Sayuri was garish and poorly photographed. And then, by the end of the movie, I really did not care that Sayuri's wish had come true. * teeny spoiler end * So confused as to what went wrong, I actually waited for the credits to roll. And that's when the enlightenment occurred! Aha, directed by Rob Marshall (Chicago) and produced by Steven Spielberg (...).

379,ebuttitta,I Should Not Have Read the Book Before I Watched,6,12 January 2018,"I read a beautiful novel. Granted, I do not know much about Japanese culture, but the book was filled with information and subtlety that made me feel as though I did. The impression I felt was one of stifled hope under a beautiful mask that finally was able to burst through during the final pages. I cried.Then, I watched the movie, hopeful that it would be the embodiment of all of the emotion that the book had evoked from me. I normally have lower expectations of movie adaptations of books I have read because I understand that it is impossible to fit in every event and detail, but this film, for me, fell short.The beginning of the film was done incorrectly. The story of Sayuri being ripped from her family and subsequently throwing fits and crying was not true to the story and took away a piece of her character. When I read, I was struck by the fact that Sayuri didn't show much emotion more than silent crying and took that to be a cultural response. Sayuri being loud and throwing fits mischaracterized her.Hatsumomo was miscast, and Mameha was not done quite right. The character of Hatsumomo seemed too loud as I imagined her with a kind of quiet cruelty. Mameha was such an important character that I didn't feel she was given enough time or credit for all that she taught and gave to Sayuri. I wanted to see more of them entertaining as geisha. What a night for them would be like. Also, in the book, Mameha clearly plots directly against Hatsumomo, which, to me, was another important detail.The moment in which she meets the Chairman was not nearly as beautiful or heavily emphasized as it should have been. This was the moment when Sayuri was lost and without life direction and then decided to tether all of her hopes and dreams on this one man. Ken Watanabe was perfectly cast, but their meeting was too abrupt and insignificant. Nobu's character wasn't developed nearly enough. It was never truly explained how much he cared for her or the true reason why Sayuri did not want him as a patron. He was also supposed to be more disfigured. I missed this detail, not for the shock factor, but because it is what makes everyone pity him and what helps drive the Chairman to keeping himself away. I feel cheated because the most pivotal scene was changed. Sayuri should never have thrown the Chairman's handkerchief to the wind. She would have kept it always and never parted it with it for anything. She should have laid it in front of the Chairman as he spoke so that he would know that she loved him, too. Then end just wasn't right. The progression of the film was beautiful. I love the score, and I particularly love the scene in which she transforms into a geisha. The scene in which Sayuri danced was absolute heaven. Visually, the movie did many things right. Content-wise, it was a miss for me.",Memoirs of a Geisha
380,nikovski,Hugely disappointing,2,17 June 2006,"I was looking forward to seeing this film, expecting fairly competent work by the director and cast. Not really - a dialogue delivered in barely understandable English with thick Chinese accent is anything but authentic. The accents of the actresses are wrong, their intonations are wrong, the dances are wrong, their manners are wrong - in short, this film just screams ""Fake!"". I do not pretend to understand Japanese culture all that well, but still I work for a Japanese company, have been to Japan a few times, and work with Japanese colleagues every day, so if the film looks so fake to me, I can only imagine how it would look like to people that come from this culture or are deeply familiar with it. This is very regrettable, given the reputation of the director and the capabilities and budget of the studio that produced the film. Was it that hard to cast Japanese actors, and hire competent consultants? The only saving grace is Ken Watanabe's play (which is, however, not central to the plot), and the stunningly beautiful scenery and cinematography, which won a fully deserved Oscar. The rest, however, was hugely disappointing.",Memoirs of a Geisha
381,blonde20s,My disappointing holiday movie.,5,19 January 2006,"I generally try to not base a book by it's cover, or in this case a movie by the book it is based on... but unfortunately I couldn't help it with ""Memoirs of a Geisha"".I was first hand very disappointed the movie was in English, and I do understand for two reasons, which I will mention, why it was. Never the less it would have seemed more powerful if it had been in Japanese.1) The book is an English translation of a fictional story (from the Japanese) 2) the 3 main characters were Chinese Actresses, and therefore did not speak Japanese. (Though Ziyi Zhang does say words such as ""Gomen sai"" ""Arigato"" and ""-san"").The story I found ran too quickly, and though it was beautiful to watch, it didn't show the emotional conflict she had at becoming a Geisha.Points I had problems with: 1)The narrator appeared at the beginning of the movie, then disappeared until half way through, then she narrated every 10 minutes.2)The grandmother character appears in one scene and then is never seen or mentioned again in the film (even though she lives with the main character).3)The dance sequence (which I found rather hyped up in the press), was rather short, as well was very modern for the time (1930s).4)Every character (except Sayuri and Pumpkin) DIDN'T AGE in the 10-12 Year span the movie was supposed to take place in! (no gray hairs or wrinkles, Ken Wantanabe, and Hatsumomo still looked the same, though her character was supposed to be becoming less desirable) 5) Every character had a Japanese name except Pumpkin, (who in the book was named by Sayuri because of her big head), but in the movie was always named Pumpkin for no reason.6) I thought that maybe the reason everyone in Japan spoke English was because it was supposed to be the translation in the narrators mind, but they even spoke their very articulate (yet some-what broken) English to the American soldiers (in the book she had a translator, because even as an old lady she barely spoke a word).What I did like: 1) the scenery was beautiful, The mountains, and the costumes were beautiful (they should receive an Oscar nod for that).2) Michelle Yeoh always amazes me how she can command a role. Ziyi Zhang was good, but Michelle Yeoh really stood out for me.Though I was really disappointed I will still give this film my blonde ambition grade of C+ (translated to a 5 for IMDb).

I just couldn't get over the fact that the three leading ladies were impostors. Not one of them could pronounce their own character's name let alone the very few common Japanese phrases that were sprinkled here and there to authenticate the movie.

With so little publicity already, do you think they'd do better with no-name Japanese actors? Though there are a few Japanese actors and actresses that are known on the mainstream (I repeat, mainstream) movies, there are many Chinese actors and actresses such as Ziyi Zhang and Michelle Yeoh. As well, if you get annoyed you can always look at Ken Watanabe (the Chairman) and Suzuka Ohgo (little Chiyo)and others who are actually Japanese.For people who've read the book, yes, it's a bit different, but what movie isn't? Look at the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Harry Potter series, V for Vendetta, and tell me that they're exactly like the book.All in all it's a great movie that does what it is supposed to: entertain.

Not even when young Chiyo escaped though the rooftops. I don't know what was wrong since I'm not an expert but I expected more beauty, more art. Isn't that what geishas do? Art, music, literature, sensuality, beauty, happiness, smiles There's a fire in one of the scenes and it is pure fantasy. It kept going for the longest while without anybody putting it off and I don't remember seeing anything burnt. One of the previous opinions says the film was thirty minutes too long. I didn't find it long, but what I was waiting for never arrived. When the film ended I thought ""is that it?"" and left the theater head down avoiding to see anybody who would ask me what I thought of it.",Memoirs of a Geisha

I would never read such a book, but to watch such a beautiful, touching film- it was truly engrossing.The little girl who plays the young Sayuri was absolutely brilliant....I am not certain why there is not Oscar Buzz about her performance...it was profound...her expressions, her breadth of emotion....she was exceptional...I think that it would be hard to improve on this film...it was so beautifully, and ellegantly assembled...presented with such visual finesse, it is hard to think of a movie in recent times that achieves what this film achieves visually...It's Capote, Memoirs, Walk the Line, Syriana, Munich and Good Night and Good Luck as far as I am concerned come Oscar time",Memoirs of a Geisha
388,yutty0906,set in a mysterious and exotic world,7,12 February 2014,It is very well acted first of all and looks beautiful . This is a great story about the life of an orphaned girl sold by her dying parents to the sex trade. Then brought up to become a geisha.It is a very moving story and is very much a chick flick but it is far from boring and unsatisfying.If you do not like chick flicks then I would not suggest this to you but I do not like chick flicks usually and I love it still. If you manage fall asleep watching this film then you should just stick to watching explosions.But if you like movies with great acting and a compelling story then you will likely love this movie.,Memoirs of a Geisha
389,The_smallest_rose,It was cute,6,1 January 2006,"the movie was almost better then avg. i had read the book but the person i was wish hadn't. If you didn't read the book some parts migth be hard to follow I love Geishas i think they are very pretty and i wish i could go back in time to see what they were like. I wouldn't use this movie as a way to see what there lives were really like. As a historic snapshot, not so good. As a fun way to waste away 2 or so hours. GREAT! Don't go if you want to ""know the truth"" about the Geisha. This movie and book are fiction. View it as such. It's a good movie, not great but very pretty and heart breaking (i cried like 3 times )",Memoirs of a Geisha
390,fais84,review,1,23 December 2005,"Rather then long dance sequences and close ups of the characters which made the film drag on - the movie would have been better served explaining the story and motivations of the characters.The marginalisation of Nubo, the minister, auntie, mother - and the dumbing down of the dynamic and IMPORTANT rivalry between hatsumo and mameha and hatsumo and sayuri made the movie lack any real depth. If you hadn't read the book you would not really understand why Sayuri loved the Chairman and why Mameha became her mentor at all.Visually the film was stunning - and the actors all did the best with the C rate script they were given, but that was all that was good about this movie.",Memoirs of a Geisha
391,stealthmujik,A great glimpse into the Geisha life but nowhere as deep as the book,7,4 January 2006,"This is a visually gorgeous film. The cinematography achieved here is by far the best I've seen of any film thus far this year. The score is also quite stunning.But while this movie makes a great deal to appeal to the eyes and ears of the audience, it fails to connect to the heart as the novel did.Don't get me wrong, the casting is not the problem. As an Asian-American myself I did not have any problems with the casting of non-Japanese. Granted, it would have been nice to use more Japanese stars for a largely Japanese movie, but I understand that there's still a gap between American viewers and Asian stars (which is quite sad, but I must admit it's getting better). I don't understand why there's such controversy over that when we have American stars that play Jewish, Polish, Australian, British folks and visa versa.But I think the problem lays in the fact that they have tried to squeeze such a huge novel with such strong emotional connections and tried to squeeze it into a movie. Yes the movie is quite long and it is well paced for a movie but being so constrained, it just cannot pack the moving punch it did with the novel.I will give the movie the fact that it does do a great job conveying the life of a geisha- negating the stereotypes, telling the facts, the joys, and the many hardships and struggles that they had to undergo.The actors and actresses here, especially Gong Li as Hatsumomo, do a steller job conveying a wide spectrum of emotions beautifully from confusion to envy, joy to despair. The director Rob Marshall also does, I believe, the best job he or anyone could've.But again, this movie, as wonderful as it is, just cannot do justice as the book did. This is a gorgeous film that will serve as a real 101 course into the life of a Geisha but if you want to feel something from it I highly recommend that you go read the book.",Memoirs of a Geisha
392,jmdayumi,One of the best movies I've seen this year. It was very authentic and moving--brilliantly done.,10,24 December 2005,"Okay, I saw the movie last night and... wow. I thought the trailer was pretty good, but it mislead you to believe it was just about some geisha with blue eyes who, against all odds, became famous... and there was drama... and it was pretty... the end. Which, isn't that bad, I suppose...But it was definitely NOT that. It was so much... better. They really dove into her character, and she began to change and mold herself as the movie progressed. The cinematography was absolutely stunning, and the story was just so... moving, I suppose. But not that corny, love-dovey chick movie type of stuff, or ""Miracle"" go make the world a better place touching, just a ""wow"" kind of thing.And the movie doesn't idolize her character either; she makes bad decisions and stumbles awkwardly on her way to becoming a geisha, and even after that. And it didn't have much of a happy ending, which was a nice change of face; it was a bit bittersweet perhaps, or maybe sad, but certainly not the ""live happily ever after"" I thought it would be. It just really... surprised me.I have to say that I have four favorite scenes: the first is when she is a child, and she is found in Hatsumomo's room... just the whole sequence with them. It wasn't really dramatic, or funny, or anything in particular... just the actress who played Hatsumomo was ""wow"". Throughout the entire movie... and even to the last scene with her, you can't really decipher her. She's constantly a bitch, which you know, but you can never decide whether she has any hope for herself anymore.The second is when Sayuri (Chiyo) is older, and finds Hatsumomo in HER room. I won't give anything away, but it was a satisfying scene.My third favorite scene is when the Baron invites her into the house to present her with a gift: an exquisite kimono. I won't dish out any details for that scene, but it was just-- unexpected. Ziyi Zhang (the actress who plays Chiyo/Sayuri) was so EMOTIONAL and grabbing in that scene that I was on the verge of tears. And I NEVER cry in movies. EVER.The final scene was the last one. I can't reveal anything in that one either, but... the scenery was, of course, beautiful. It was surprising and shocking, but it was very touching all at the same time. I almost cried there, too. And then to finish it off with the narration and fade into the black, with that GORGEOUS Japanese music blending in and the credits rolling...My uncle and I just sat there, dazed. I couldn't believe it was over. It wasn't that the movie was short... there were actually some times when I was like 'wow, this movie is really long.' (Not that I was bored, just disbelieving) And the ending was so abrupt--you really don't expect it until the last couple seconds of the scene... almost as if it seems like there will be more of the movie.I like how the movie was in phases, fairly equally split up. There was her childhood, her as a fifteen-year-old to late teen, and then the post-war phase. I do think that I liked the middle bit the best, but it was set up to be that way. The beginning was difficult, then you progress to the middle, golden age, and then there's the after-war section towards the end where everything seems to be crashing down. It just seems to keep getting worse, and everything seems forgotten and ""thrown to the wind"". It almost makes me think of a movie that goes through the struggle to the triumph, but then, for some reason, keeps going. It really gives an all-encompassing feeling.Overall, it was wonderful. I would rate it maybe a little less than a ten out of ten. (But since I can't give it a 9.75 out of ten, I rounded up.) Really fantastic for what Hollywood has been dishing out lately. I really suggest it to anyone--it appeals to a wide range of audiences.",Memoirs of a Geisha
393,pajamas_86,Great Asian Mix,8,24 January 2006,"Well, of course this movie can be criticized for having Chinese to act as Japanese. However, there's not much difference with that thick makeup. If they casted 3 Japanese unknowns for this movie, this will be quite disastrous because it will take more effort to go to the cinemas to catch it. I'm quite OK with the accent (japanese's English is even harder to understand than the 3 of them). Gong Li is really a breakthrough, being so bitchy and vengeful in the movie, captures the spirit of Hatsumomo very well. This movie is recommended to those who wanted to those who want to know mysterious Japanese culture but without the hassle of NatGeo documentaries. It has really nice scenes, like Sakura blooming (it looks fake when Sayuri touches the tree...) and the autumn leaves... This show makes me wanna go to Japan...",Memoirs of a Geisha
394,ayala-7,Disappointing by any measures,1,30 January 2006,"I didn't expect this film to be a master piece. Neither did I expect it to follow the details and the story line in the book in a religious accuracy. And of course it didn't. In fact, this film is characterized by the most terrible pacing and timing, unconvincing acting, and is incredibly poorly written. Just like a money-driven Hollywood film should be. However, those important features (casting, acting, timing, screenplay, etc.) put aside, this film is also under-satisfying visually, with its many dark scenes that prevent one from enjoying the extravagant kimonos that were so carefully thought of. The set design also lacks the Japanese refined aesthetic that is so evident in the book. Not to mention the non authentic make up of the geisha (completely Westernized full red lips, rather than just the bottom lip and many other flaws that are quite disturbing and take away from the exotic allure of the geisha phenomenon). Also, there were many poor choices in changing crucial moments in the plot which made the story quite meaningless emotionally and very unoriginal. If you have read the book and loved it, you can definitely pass on this film. If you watched the film and thought it miserably made, don't let this prevent you from reading the book, which is an incredible experience on its own.",Memoirs of a Geisha
395,Thiago_SinBoy,Boring,1,12 December 2005,"Wow.....this movie is really boring. There is nothing here that works. The story borders and borders, and leaves us wanting to go to our lovely beds. The geishas look like Japanese prostit*tes and the acting is dreadful. The only good thing is the costume design and stuff. That should receive an Oscar. Now, the rest is up to a Razzie. The film takes on forever and is not emotionally appealing. It is just a Chinese soap-opera. I hate soap-operas. I really do. And paying eight bucks to see it on the big screen is just horrible. Avoid this film at all costs. Watch King Kong instead, which is devilish fun. This here is achingly boring.",Memoirs of a Geisha

For me, Gong Li and Zhang Ziyi's performances are outstanding. I didn't see any other performance in any film of 2005 which comes close. 1. Re the cultural authenticity issue - the film is based on a book which is a work of fiction. It is not based on the real life of a geisha. Hence, I find the film fairly accurate as far as the book is concerned. 2. Re the language issue - I don't recall any complaints that in the movie ""Troy"", no one spoke Greek or even sounded Greek. The cast should instead be praised for making the effort to learn a new and strange language. 3. Re casting - As the film's director Rob Marshall said ""you cast the best person for the role"". I believe he did in this film.",Memoirs of a Geisha

A very artsy movie the equivalent of walking through The Gates in Central Park. ""Who cares"". Although colorful,this movie was very slow moving and was hard to watch. It did contain a history lesson for all viewers unaware that American soldiers were actually stationed in Japan during WWII. Geisha girl did have it's moments as the struggles of these young girls come across the screen.The young actresses are good the older ones come across like a bad foreign film. Now, be honest with yourself after watching this movie and tell me if I am wrong.

400,dukkie-1,A fantastic adaptation of Arthur Golden's novel.,9,15 January 2006,"Having read Memoirs of a Geisha quite recently and loving it, I was excited to hear that the film was being released. I went into the cinema expecting a film as beautiful as the book and was definitely not disappointed.Despite all the fuss over Chinese actors being cast as Japanese, I thought the casting was perfect. In the end, does it really matter what nationality the actors are? They did a brilliant job and it's no different to an American portraying an Englishman, which happens all the time, so I think all the critics basing their judgement on nationality is ridiculous.The first thing that struck me was that this film is beautifully shot, with so much vibrancy and life that it really draws you in. At first I found the accents quite difficult to understand, and I'm not entirely sure it should've been done in English, but you soon get used to it. The first few chapters of the book are over in literally a minute, which was quite surprising, but I can see why they didn't include it. However, if you haven't read the book, I expect the opening sequence was quite confusing and this was confirmed by my friend who saw it with me.I thought Hatsumomo was fantastic, just as evil and conniving as you'd imagine, Mother and Auntie were also spot on but I felt that Granny was pretty much overlooked, which was quite a disappointment. Other than that, I don't think they left anything else out of the film that was totally necessary. Maybe a little more insight into the training of Geisha would've been nice. Michelle Yeoh was perfect as Mameha, and truly understood the character. Another pleasant surprise was Pumpkin, who was just as I had imagined, though I'm not sure they got the clumsiness of her character across, and the fact that she wasn't as skilled as Sayuri.As the story progressed into a love story between the Chairman and Sayuri, I thought it wasn't as clichéd as some people thought, in fact, it's more realistic that many such stories, spanning over many years and with many complications. The cherry blossom scene was stunning and the Baron was delightfully devious.One of my favourite parts of the film has to be when the American's arrive. I thought the way in which Pumpkin and several other Geisha became so Western was very poignant and really emphasised the culture of Japan.Overall, I loved this film. It stuck very closely to the book, while still staying separate enough not to act as a substitute. It was beautiful visually, had great music and fantastic acting. Certainly a brilliant way to start off your film viewing of 2006.",Memoirs of a Geisha
401,realistic-me,Memoirs of a Geisha,5,31 December 2005,"Pros: 1.) The costumes were truly beautiful. 2.) The set was was awesome.3.) The narration was wonderful. I had personally enjoyed that it was narrated by an old woman.4.) HAD A THEME. There are honestly some movies out there without a film. 5.) The kid actress were really good. I had been surprised. In most part, the kids had been better than the adults. Cons: 1.) The actors/actress do not speak English. If you were to watch the movie, I would say you should prepare yourself for some really strong Asian accent. This problem often leads to some of the badly acted scenes. The only good part that came out of this was probably that you KNEW the actors were Asian. 2.) The movie often use Japanese. I have thought that it would have been better to at least have subtitles. During the first few scenes, it is in complete Japanese. If you are --like me-- a non-Japanese speaker. You would be completely lost. 3.) Not all actors/actress are Japanese. I had expected a full Japanese cast. It was a bit off-putting if you could tell the difference. 4.)It was too long. There were honestly some scenes that I had thought it could have done without or could have been cut shorter. Altogether, I give it a five star. It wasn't very good. It wasn't one of those movies that catch your eye at the beginning. I started really paying attention in the middle when the character had been all grown up. However, don't let my comment turn you off from the movie. As I always say ""Different stroke for different folks."" The movie could be brilliant to you, it just didn't catch my interest all that much. I wouldn't suggest kids from 13 and under to go watch it though. It would not appeal to them much. There was a nine year old next to me in the theatre muttering, ""This is boring,"" throughout the film.",Memoirs of a Geisha
402,marklwatts,Sadly awful,1,16 December 2005,"Even though the book wasn't strictly accurate to the real situation it described it still carried a sense of Japan. I find it hard to believe that anyone who was involved in making this film had ever been to japan as it didn't feel Japanese in the slightest. Almost everything about it was terrible. I will admit the actors were generally quite good but couldn't stand a chance of saving it. Before the film started I was surprised that there were only ten people in the cinema on a Friday night shortly after the movie had opened in Japan. 30 minutes in I was amazed they stayed. I stayed so I would have the right to criticize it. The whole movie was punctuated my groans and suppressed laughs of disbelief from my Japanese girlfriend. Everyone I saw walking out of that cinema had looks of confusion and disappointment on their faces. To the makers of this movie, you owe me two hours.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Well,I really like it from heart........ sorry,a little bit without words now........ I'm not like some professionals,so I just judge this film from a normal audience's eyes. It's no doubt that the PICTURES of the movie really gorgeous,and no doubt that three main actress(ZiYi,GongLi,Yang)are all amazing.Especially GongLi,I really hate her(from the movie),but now I really like her(as an actress).ZiYi is also great,don't worry,she's still so young,we'll see more of her beautiful face in the future:-) As a male audience,I love them more:-) Who want to go with me to watch the movie again? Waiting for the National Releasing one week later:-)",Memoirs of a Geisha
404,markz-8,All my hopes fulfilled,9,16 December 2005,"I had had very high hopes for this film, given my enjoyment of the novel and its film pedigree (director Rob Marshall, music by John Williams, and a cast including Ziyi Zhang and Ken Watanabe), but after seeing some clips, I was getting worried that I had my expectations too high. I needn't have worried. All my hopes were fulfilled by this movie. I was enchanted, entranced, and held by the world it presented. The music complemented the film magnificently. The performances - particularly difficult for those actors to whom English is a recently-learned skill, such as Zhang - were uniformly excellent. The young ladies who played the main characters as children were also quite good. The real surprise to me was Gong Li, who was outstanding as Hatsumomo, a kind of role in which I would not have pictured her excelling. At the end, I teared up a bit, and then just sat there with a feeling of satisfaction running through me all during the end credits. Marshall's fine visual style in ""Chicago"" did not desert him here. Why did I not give the movie a 10? There were a few unusual editing choices that occasionally appeared to disrupt a scene (including the very last sequence), and some of the dialogue was difficult to catch on a first viewing. However, the way scenes were allowed to build, and character coming first, made the contrivances of the original story palatable on film. Yes, there are contrivances, and yes, this is not a story about saving the world. It is a very personal story in which no one is blameless. But I was transported to that story and the world around it, and that is why I go to movies - a pleasure that I rarely experience in this fullness.",Memoirs of a Geisha

And it looked like that's what made her so special. WHY oh why did they decide to ruin it like this? A Japanese girl with blue eyes? How did this happen? Especially a girl from a small fishing village back in the 30's, coming from Japanese parents.... Quite interesting. A good idea maybe? I tried to keep an open mind when I went to see it finally...Yes, I gave in, for the sake of a book I had loved reading. The book was captivating from the beginning. It's one of those books that once you start reading, you can't put down. One of my favorite books that I've suggested to many people as a great read. The main thing that ruined it for me were the blue eyes and how they were the focus point of everyone's attention. The book never said anything about her having colored eyes.",Memoirs of a Geisha
406,redindygo,Behind the white faced beauties...,8,20 February 2006,"Gracefulness, attraction, jealousy and love are the main theme of this movie. Never mind that some of the casts are not English speakers. Its all about getting a glimpse of the culture, life and role of women during the imperial time.I praise Rob Marshall for being able to merge the A list of Asian actors and create an exquisite blend of story. Behind the white faced beauties and graceful movement of the geishas are women whose hearts are filled with strength, yearnings and courage. It showed how much power and spell can a woman's charm bewitched men.Zhang Ziyi is born to play the role of Sayuki. She was able to convey the hardships and gracefulness of the geisha. I got no doubt about her ability after seeing her performance in past movies like Flying daggers and Crouching tiger. Her eyes and graceful movements were also been able to highlight by the wonderful cinematography of the movie.Michelle Yeoh made a wonderful performance also. Just by listening to the way she delivers her line you can clearly tell that she likes her role as Mameya. She portrayed Mameya's character as a combination of wit, grace and stern which was effective for the viewers eye.Gong Li's character was filled with much complexity and I give her thumbs up for being able to play the role as well. Her character was torn between the rules of being a geisha and her desire as a woman who yearns to love and be loved. Yet she was fearful to fight for her love and ended up being in misery. She symbolizes the yearnings and fears of every geisha who is on the verge of loosing one's patron once young rivals blossoms.Although men appeared as a supporting cast they were able draw their lines well especially Ken Watanabe as always was able to show his sternly yet charming demeanor on fleshing out the role of the chairman and as playing as the secret puppeteer.Pumpkin, Sayuki's friend who has a passive impulsive temper played as the two faced woman who wanted to be a geisha since she was little. She symbolizes the rest of the women who were willing to do anything in order to survive during the difficult time of war. Through her it was explained to the viewers how did the westerners at that time misinterpreted the meaning of a geisha as a plain prostitute who dress in a kimono and wears a white face powder.I give credit to the rest of the crew because they we're able to create an atmosphere of the imperial era of Japan for the viewers to see. From the props to the set, to the lighting effects everything was in coordination. This is a movie that is worth watching your time and money",Memoirs of a Geisha
407,jeffok7,Annoying misrepresentation,4,23 December 2005,"Memoirs of a Geisha, while visually lavish, is yet another example of Hollywood's shallowness and pandering to stereotypical views of Japan. For anyone who has spent any time in Japan and is familiar with Japanese culture, it is a grotesque contortion of the Geisha profession and a promiscuous pandering to audiences hungry for Asian exoticism. The Chinese actresses couldn't be more un-Japanese, lacking in the grace and sophistication of real Japanese women, and with obvious Chinese accents that simply grate in this context. All this serves to cheapen the film even more that it otherwise would be. Very disappointing.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Some scenes for book-lovers were cut out, but most likely because of time constraint and plot development.The actors were rightly casted. The leading lady, Ziyi Zhang, seemed to have a little trouble with acting as Sayuri, but did a fine job. The rest of the actors were beautiful except for Li Gong. Her acting in posture was brilliant but her words were empty. The rest of the cast made up for it however.Setting was wonderful. The detail in each scene of the set was awe-inspiring. It definitely creates a whole other world for us to become part of.The movie was an aesthetic success.",Memoirs of a Geisha

It would be as if there were a movie set in Rome during Roman times, and instead of having Italian actresses, all of the lead roles were played by Swedes. Even though there are blonde/blue-eyed Italians and brunette/brown-eyed Swedes, there are still differences in bone structure (which would perhaps not be noticed by people not familiar with either nationality, but for those who are...well, it would be grating). And it also made me wonder--are there no good Japanese actresses who could have been cast in those roles?",Memoirs of a Geisha
410,summers_201,We liked it,8,3 January 2006,"Having read the book last century (on a 10 day sailing trip through the Whitsundays in Australia - but that is another story) and thoroughly enjoyed it, I was always going to see any film adaptation of the novel. My wife, Seiko, on the other hand, was aghast that the Hollywood producers had cast non-Japanese actors in the lead roles and was reticent to see yet again a film with a Japanese theme ruined by American cultural ignorance. ""Chinese women cannot even come close to being geisha!"", she snorted. ""There are so many good Japanese actresses - why did they not cast in Japan??""... Hai, hai, I thought.For my part, I believe that actors, good actors at any rate, should have the ability to portray even Masai tribesmen with the right preparation and generous prosthetics. I am also a huge fan of Zhang Zhiyi and her illuminated predecessor, Gong Li, and when I heard that both actresses had been cast, I added the film to my list of ""end-of-year must-sees"".I dragged my protesting partner with me to a cavernous theater in Shinjuku, one of the main entertainment hubs in Tokyo, and we were shocked at how few people there were. Normally, for a Hollywood blockbuster in Japan, one has to be prepared to line up at least an hour before and expect no empty seats. The matinée session we attended on a public holiday was less then a third full. Hmmmm.... Perhaps Japanese cinema-goers were already boycotting it. Not a good sign I thought.But, the film itself was better than we both expected. Even my taciturn wife had changed her opinion ""except for the ridiculous snow dance sequence"". It is an undeniable visual treat (all the more remarkable considering the modern-day Potoncho and Gion districts in Kyoto retain little of their glorious geisha pasts and filming there would have been out of the question) and the acting is for the most part credible despite the rote-learned dialogue some of the actresses were reported to have undergone. Momoi Kaori, the owner of the okiya, was the most convincing I thought; an amazingly authentic performance and a pity Ms Momoi was not younger - her pedigree would have made her a great Sayuri, my wife reckoned.Anyway, just wanted to add my three cents' worth. I hope the film will perform better on DVD release!",Memoirs of a Geisha
411,bobbielin,Beautiful,10,15 January 2006,"I went to see this movie not really knowing anything about it. I was completely in awe the entire time I sat there in the theater. I'm an All American Woman...I even ate a hot-dog & coke during the previews just before the movie began....I would have eaten apple pie if they had it! I loved this movie starring Chinese actors. I's a story about a little Japanese girl who longs to be a Geisha for her own deep heartfelt reasons. You'll feel your heart skipping in the first 5 minutes of the movie, wanting to know what happens next. LOVED IT , LOVED IT, LOVE IT! All of the acting is in English and easy to hear and understand. Several of the actresses I recognized from the movie ""The Joy Luck Club"". Plus, I'm glad I had a tissue in my purse! It's filled with deep emotion. You will feel every emotion watching this great movie.Bobbie Stay Home Mom",Memoirs of a Geisha
412,scrodchunk-1,Weak directorial effort with a thin plot,5,20 January 2006,"I was expecting a beautifully filmed movie with perhaps an overly romanticized plot. I was surprised that it was fairly mediocre cinematography, with weak plot. Maybe the director was trying to create something like 'House of Flying Daggers' look, but it was not nearly as beautifully filmed. The romance was even thin basis for the story and unengaging.The screenplay has weak dialog, and directorally, it has some really ""stagey"" looking scenes - a case in point: the one where they first show awkward American soldiers walking around in perfectly pressed fatigues looked like a scene from a high school production of south pacific (but with more expensive sets).There were lots of big unexplainable holes too. My favourite is this: A girl gets kidnapped at 5 or 6 or 7 years old from a fishing village, is enslaved in a Geisha house, gets rushed away to the rural mountains to escape the dying days of the war, then is pulled out of the mountains... and speaks perfect English to American soldiers, as do all her friends.Or how about: Girl is trained to show a little bit of wrist skin, because it gets the men very excited. Then goes away to escape the war, comes back and they all skinny-dip with Americans... but then it flips back as she is shocked, SHOCKED, that an American made a pass at her.I also thought it incongruous that the young girl is obsessed with getting back her sister (seems reasonable) and she does, yet someone shortly tells her her sister left, and her reaction is basically - ""Oh okay - hey! look at that dreamy 30 year old guy"" Maybe you'll feel those inconsistencies were just a bit of the sloppiness. Also, I noticed a few points where they seemed to be mixing up Chinese culture with Japanese culture as if they didn't know the difference. Perhaps it's an American myopia thing, but I wasn't surprised at the closing credits to see it was written by a non-Japanese, male author. I don't know anything about the author or screenplay writer, but I had the vague sense of a flamboyant gay kimono wearing writer fantasizing about Japan... or somewhere over there where they wear saris or kimonos or something.This may be stretching it a bit but I had a sense of something a bit distasteful in the message that the movie leaves with you. Isn't it kind of saying ""If you're a 30 or 40 year old that thinks that 6 year old girl is pretty hot looking, your grandest dream is to groom her for your future lover."" I'd think that sentiment would be a better one behind a movie that digs into the seamy underbelly of pedophilia or something. Kind of reminds me of Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" message: ""If you think that chick is hot, kidnap her and she'll gradually come around to liking you."" So, yeah, not too impressed with this one.Hope the book was better",Memoirs of a Geisha
413,grozzlybear,Beautifully filmed and directed but not totally convincing acting,7,24 January 2006,"I hadn't read the book that this film was based upon, but I had read some positive reviews before seeing this, which is a film I wouldn't have otherwise bothered with. Certainly, in terms of pure visual spectacle, it is quite stunning at times, sometimes movingly so, and it is paced and directed with care. It is quite captivating for the most part, but let down I feel by too much under-par acting to carry the emotional intensity with any real aplomb and also I felt a degree of predictability about the whole story, which are my main quibbles. I wasn't surprised by the ending and not moved much as a result - it should have been more intense than it was - but the acting wasn't up to the demands of the film. Bottom line though is that I was glad that I took the effort to see it. Probably be badged as a bit of a chic film because of it's strongly female oriented subject matter, but guys shouldn't dismiss it because of that. Could have been so much more substantial with better casting.",Memoirs of a Geisha
414,wggmff,"Outer impressiveness, Inner emptiness",7,25 January 2006,"Just as James T. Farrell mentioned in his 'The language of Hollywood' -- '.... What characterizes almost all Hollywood pictures is their inner emptiness. This is compensated for by an outer impressiveness. Such impressiveness usually takes the form of a truly grandiose realism. Nothing is spared to make the setting, the costumes, all of the surface details correct. These efforts help to mask the essential emptiness of the characterization, and the absurdities and trivialities of the plots....' Memories of a Geisha is a typical this kind of Hollywood movie, the scenes of this movie are so luxuriant and flowery, the casts are dazzling, the story is well organized, but the whole movie, just let me fell emptiness. When I finished the movie, I just could remember some beautiful scenes and faces, but the movie could not go deep inside my heart: no impressive personality, no haunted plots.This maybe one of the best movie in this year  considering no many good movies in this year, and that's it. We will still remember Forrest Gamp and Schindler's list now, but after five years, will you still remember Memories of a Geisha?",Memoirs of a Geisha
415,ian-975,Few and far in between.,9,8 February 2006,"I just can't bring my self to give any film a 10/10 as I don't think that anything can be perfect, there is always room for improvement but this film would get a 9.5 if I could grant decimals.Where to begin talking about it is the problem. I would like here to focus purely on the filmic quality of the feature. The story line would be a whole new thing and the general commentary would take too long to place here. I may post this later on though.Japanese culture is so rich and full of art that it is impossible to get a film to even come close to the complexities involved therein. It is a culture based on symbols and feeling, a culture so rich that western society often gets lost in the depth.The same would apply here. I personally have a very deep admiration of Japanese culture and, while not being in any way a knowledgeable source, have read and researched the culture quite deeply. The film has gone that extra mile to try to give a glimpse into this complexity. Hand motions, facial features, honour, dignity etc... these are all portrayed in the feature.To give a small critical analysis of a sequence I would like to describe and give thoughts on the river scene after the escape from the war.River scene.The water theme is used heavily in the whole feature. Water is a great element, washes clean but also has the power to destroy. Water has the power to heal and hurt. We start the sequence with an extreme close up of water gargling, then the camera pans slowly up, revealing a small trickle of redness in it. The redness now increases and changes into a flowing red cloth, all the while the camera is still moving up and we then see that Sayuri Nitta is washing this cloth. She is pulling it up leaving a trail of dye in the water.Symbologically leaving a trail of blood in water, water that is moving down stream, carrying in it life, water that is her, she is water, her own life is being carried out of her. This scene speaks similar to Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho, the shower murder. We see the water going down the drain, water with blood in a clean environment. Water here is going down river again in an environment that is clean, it is used for cleaning after all. In Psycho we see that there is a murder - death - pain, here though she is not murdered, or is she? She is being killed, her blood is being sucked out from her, the life of the Geisha is going downstream. Suddenly she is told she has a visitor. The man whom she made love her has come back, though not her beloved chairman. He is ruined all money lost, his life is also flowing down river. There is hope, can she still be a Geisha. Is there any of that blood still in her.The whole shot sequence is filmed brightly in brilliant colour. Here is the beginning a new. It is the start and all is based on whether the river has taken all her Geisha out of her. She is weathered and out of it, the Geisha in her is almost gone.The scene is complex in its simplicity. Graphically the whole sequence is bursting with symbols, and shows the very symbolic nature of the Japanese. Naturally the whole film is full of these visual analogies but mentioning them all here is too time consuming.This is an amazing film and one that I will buy and add to my personal collection for sure. One viewing of the film is not enough and I was almost sad when it was over.A great film.",Memoirs of a Geisha
416,rwinestock,Best in Cinema no doubt,7,10 March 2006,"I agreed with each of the three Oscar awards. Nothing came close in filmography or costumes this past year. I am glad that the PC police lost out, because each breathtaking shot was delicately and accurately flayed out as a sushi chef would present his offering to the customer. The story became alive and interesting with the development of the shots and costumes. Mesmorizing in style, a pictoral videolog remains inside the cavities of my thoughts. My dad spent a couple of years in Osaka during the mid 50's and this movie filled in the color to his descriptive narrative on the culture and the geishas of the past.

The most beautiful being the kabuki scene. Regarding the portrayal of Japanese actors, according to my experience with Japanese men it lacked the common inexpressiveness on their communication.I would say go see it for its beauty, really.

420,GreenIsTheSea,How Disappointing!,4,10 March 2007,"Only a 4 out of 10 and that goes mainly to the Photography and costumes as I was extremely disappointed! Once again America is turning what could have been a masterpiece into an average movie. Why on earth such movie was in English, don't Americans know how to read anymore (subtitles) ? The small transitions between English and Japanese is very clumsy and really out of place. Rob Marshall would have done a better job by filming it in Japanese language and dubbing it afterward leaving the choice to the audience of watching it in whichever language. (I've seen Crouching Tiger hidden Dragon in English and felt is was utter Rubbish, saw it again a couple of years later in Chinese and can say it's a Masterpiece, proper language makes all the difference). Furthermore, I have read ""Geisha of Gion"" which was the true original story and at least written by a ex-Japanese Geisha not by written by an American ""Male"" (???). I'm sure, I'm going to attract a lots of criticism with this comment but I will never be part of the 95% of people who will say ""that movie was awesome"" just because it's popular at the box office. If you think Titanic was a great movie then, please do watch ""Memoirs of a Geisha""!

Basically, this is an ignorant white male's racist, stereotypical fantasy of how they want the ""exotic orient"" and ""orientals"" to be, and it hardly reflects reality.If this is what you want, you'll probably enjoy it.

422,shades_of_a_geisha,maybe its just me,7,11 April 2006,"i don't know why i was not really impressed with the movie. I've been planning to read the book since the day i first saw it at a bookstore.anyway, here are my comments -in bringing the real flesh of a movie, it is really better to do a culture-based movie if the film makers are of the culture. but the problem is that, they might not be able to show it clearly. -there is no problem with actors from a different country portraying another nation's characters. and i would like to commend the film makers for bringing out the great visuals. -now that I've read a portion of the book, i'd say that the mise en scene of the movie is good enough. since the novel is a novel(quite long, i mean), the film makers might not be able to include all of the aspects introduced on the novel itself, and i felt sorry that they were not able to characterize the characters enough to describe, like for example, what happened to Satsu or why did Sayuri really felt that way towards Mr. Tanaka. -i really loved the way they showed the colors but i think it would be more impressing if they used high contrast for that to show clarity like for example on the scene where little Chiyo tried to escape from the okiya,since it was really dark the film makers might have showed the richness of dark sky contrasted to the faint lights provided by the lamps. -it was not much of a movie. as a visual guide, perhaps, it might have worked. i must say that the film was not consistent with its techniques. there were some scenes that i classify as ""so art film-y"" scene, but it was not consistent althroughout. there was no no style. i felt that the movie was created in order to top the book's sales...am i to harsh?or narrow minded?or is it that i just don't have an eye for art?i need ur comments.",Memoirs of a Geisha

My fear grew when I heard they had three Chinese actresses in the main roles as Japanese women. That may have been acceptable 20 years ago.I finally decided to see it on DVD--because of the very slim selection two days ago at the video store.Watching the movie was like watching a foreign language film with no subtitles. Gong Li has shown before that she cannot speak English. She showed it again. It was painful.The plot was changed greatly for the movie. It was Americanized, with an American story line constructed toward the end of the movie. The scenes with the soldiers were ridiculous.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Was she able at that point to leave the life of a Geisha or was she destined to be his on a 'mistress' basis? In the closing narration the storyteller (her own life story) mentioned only being 'half a wife' hence my questions.

Hatsumumo played out her evil role to a wicked perfection. Zhang Ziyi was amazing ,Ken Watanabe is such a great actor, and Michelle was a perfect geisha. You'd be so amazed seeing as how the actors kept to their perspective roles. Yet I have to say the only downer is the language accent. The places the shots were so beautiful that one would think it was out of a book and the kimonos are so lovely. I would recommend this movie entirely to anyone who loves a great love story.

Gong Li as always, is a force of nature and in RTRL she is allowed to be more than just eye candy like Zhang Ziyi in Memoirs. The beauty of the book version was its attention to detail and rare glimpse into the hidden world of geisha. The film contained none of that, opting instead to focus on melodrama and cat-fights. Halfway through the film, I found myself rolling my eyes at the overwrought storyline - and glossing over of the mundane realities of geisha life. Raise the Red Lantern used those moments and infused them with meaning and consequence without being so obvious AND, the actresses aren't forced to speak in halting English to accommodate those whose ears are offended by anything other than English and can't bear to read a subtitle. I just didn't really care what happened to anyone in the film because the characters did not seem real to me. I was really disappointed by this shallow, ""hollywood-ised"" mess.",Memoirs of a Geisha

To me it is no different than when in the Cowboys and Indians old westerns, there were no real Indians. I have never been overseas, but would most definitely consider going to Japan. As I watched this with my daughter, we commented on what was happening and she found it as interesting as I did.

However the dramatic feeling that I felt in the book was not reflected in the movie very well. Maybe I should have kept with the Fantasy and not go to the movie.At the very beginning the situation of why she left her home village and in what kind of a mood is not told very well. The same can be said for the horror that is put onto Chiyo and later on Sayuri in the Okiya.The movie overall is nice and the watchable but I had hoped for a movie that would follow the plot of the book more and show the horrors that Chiyo and Sayuri had to live through in more detail.

I supposed it has much to do with the fact I had read the book first, and I must say, the book is ten times more interesting and emotional. Just one scene in the book alone would have had more effect on me than the entire movie. They took out the most cruel insults that Hatsumomo, I truly think they took her character friend ""Strong, powerful, and evil"" to ""Mean, bitchy, but pathetic"". Also, though I'm a big fan of Ziyi Zhang, I feel that her expression didn't clearly explain the pain of betrayal and shock that came over her when Pumkin brought The Chairman instead of Nobu when Sayuri was creating a fake scene of her and the obese man, only to drive Nobu away from her. Her feelings were clearly stated in the book and it was an amazing part. For the movie, it just didn't work. I'm not saying the movie was absolutely boring and horrid, for I'm sure if I didn't read the book first I would've rated it at more of a 8 or 9. But hey, the text version of Memoirs of a Geisha just shows how badly planned out the movie was. They messed up the best scenes. They claimed it was just hard to squeeze it all into a two hour movie, well, they should've just made the movie longer.However, I did like the fact they modified the appearance of Geisha a bit.

Obviously there are minor discrepancies, but whether you have read the superb novel or not, anyone interested in romance and cultural productions will love this film. in high recommendation! In detail, the film does tend to capture the sparkles which make Japanese culture so intriguing, for example to clothing worn by the geisha and the charming houses spread across Kyoto.

The effects he used for making the world seemed covered in shadow by shooting the film from behind screens was a amazing.The countless water flowing in the back ground of sences reminds you of how Chio is described by her mother. Water is always flowing. Mamiha best describes Chio when they first meet when she is to begin training.The character development was well done. In many parts he shots Gong Li. And as you watch for her first English speaking role she shows her talent. I have seen her in other Chinese films and was blown away by her in her native language. But hearing her in English and her performance was just...well I haven't a word for it.Ziyi Zhang, she is my new crush! I am hunting down all her movies. She performed so well in English. Her range in acting is growing. She was so in some part and it really made me feel that emotion as well. Ken Watanabi, he is my new male crush. He played his role to a 't'.

The book had an incredible amount of detail and the movie did not even attempt to portray this. Even when they tried to show some detail, they didn't explain the entire detail. For example, when Chio had her hair done the first time and she had to lie on that neck rest, they didn't show the consequences of ruining her hair. And the sex scenes, they didn't show most of them which were the most important points in the book. I think the director missed the whole point of the story. I'm not sure if I would have liked the movie if I hadn't read the book first. There were some good things about the movie-like how they depicted her slave trade. But they also completely left out the characters Mr. Tanaka, and Sayuri's first danna. They also left out Chio's first encounter with a geisha and made her seem absolutely clueless when she first entered the okiya.

I, quite literally, had to listen to the commentaries to know that they were speaking English for the very first time ...ever.I would imagine it is easy for people to criticize if English is their first language, but I would love to see some of these critics dropped into a film in ...Russian, and try to act it out while not quite understanding what they were saying. Please. It's far harder than one might think.At any rate, this is a dazzling film, both aesthetically and musically. The acting is fabulous, the characters believable and the ending was perfect. Personally, I have no desire, whatsoever, to find out what happens to The Chairman and Sayuri after they walk away together.Naturally, I've read the book, and I do know, but that's not the point. I can't remember the last time I saw a dramatic love story where someone didn't die at the end. It is moving, touching and it makes the viewer all warm and fuzzy, the way good cinema should be.I don't need reality, it's fiction, it's film, it's supposed to be entertaining, it's supposed to lift me out of this useless diatribe I call a life, if only for a couple of hours, and let me feel what the characters are going through. And it did. That's how it should be. If I want reality ...I'll watch CNN.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Not to mention geisha originated from china in 7th century Tang dynasty alongside geisha instruments shamisen - sanxian, koto-guzheng, etc wth. not to mention Japanese uses chinese character and so does geisha word, not to mention Japanese geisha uses same makeup and hairstyle as Tang dynasty noble lady which distinctly different from heian period makeup. not to mention geisha's past is obsecure, they can come from china, korea, or dirty fishing village, the okiya mother wouldn't care the important part is she is beautiful and talented and virgin.The story is very accurate and in a way a very generic geisha's lifeThe visual and costume is where some of the inaccuracies lies, they choose to take liberties because its movie making 101, every character have to look different from one another, and it helps the story and showing the characterthe dance is an artistic representation of the real dance, this represantation helped eased up and helped demand respect from people all over the world, so when they see the real thing they actually respected it because they already saw something amazing and inspired by this real dance. again to show that geisha is very talented. not to mention the actress aren't real geisha, so they have to create something to make the actress looked talented.Not to mention the movie bring in a real life ex white geisha Liza Dalby for reference, and miyako tachibana for dance referenceOerall this movie is pretty accurate, some inaccuracies are done in other to tell the beautiful story and the real thing is very documented as well. their ignorance is what gives this movie a bad name oh well i pity them for both being ignorant and can't appreciate the art which is the very meaning of being a geisha..peace. 10/10",Memoirs of a Geisha

Perhaps it's my own fault for expecting Japanese authenticity from a Hollywood director, but I still feel that this film fell short in many areas.The story follows an American/ Hollywood formulated plot, with a clear hero and a clear evil, and a protagonist underdog that overcomes adversity, driven only by love (very 1-D). All of which, has been reused as markers of Golden Hollywood, making the film predictable and familiar, just only transplanted in Japan. The protagonist narrates to supposedly tell us her story, however, the movie is heavily filmed through the male gaze, creating a division and incongruence between clashing perspective. Theres an attempt to draw on some Japanese filmmaking themes, such as the connection to elements (water) and nature, but they are so overused that they get diluted in the obvious intention of them, eventually becoming cheesy.The cinematography's beautiful, nevertheless, as well as the costume and set designs. Yet, overall, the movie made me feel cheated of what I was expecting to see and learn from, which, if you are aware of the books background, may not come as a surprise.",Memoirs of a Geisha

450,capster-41871,"Emotional roller coaster, an old story chronicling the historical suffering of women",10,21 July 2021,"Firstly, I have read many reviews that I think, quite honestly, should not be considered REAL reviews. Those who complain that the actor's or actresses are not ethnically accurate as an actual ""review"" is so shallow. So let me say, as a reviewer of some of the reviewers, to be contentious over this as to leave a negative review on that alone flies in the face of art and cinema. Historically, plays and movies all around the world, some of which are cherished as cultural treasures, were all played by people who were not anything like the actual people the story was about. In ancient Greece and Rome, men played women for example. If you were to call every cinematic or playwright terrible simple because the people were not ACTUALLY the people the story was depicting, you would have to trash storytelling, cinema, and plays all thru history and would have nothing left to value.That out of the way, let me get to reviewing the movie. This is probably in my top 10 favorite movies of all time. As my title expresses, I think it showcases the historical challenges women have faced throughout time. In this movie, it just happens to capture that struggle as it play's out as a Geisha in pre-WW2 era Japan. Women at this time in history were relegated to the power a man had that she gave herself too. I believe this movie perfectly expresses that by expressing that. Men and Women are no different at least in one respect. We all want status, power or money. The difference is in how we attain that. In the Pre-WW2 era, women had fewer choices, and in some cases, like Chia, the character in this film, only one choice. If Chia was ever to become anything more than the daughter of poor villagers, she would have utilize her uniqueness and beauty. Her blue eyes were a rare commodity. Early on, she struggled with this concept, as any young child would that did not understand how the real world worked at the time. She was a failure as an apprentice Geisha. She was homesick, didn't understand at the time what was going on and it didn't help that the Geisha she was apprentice to saw her as a threat. The movie explores the backstabbing nature of the female struggle. Which is not a negative in any way because men were just as savage in their own ways in regards to business and war. This movie explores this from a female perspective so well and set in a very contentious time in history. This movie will tug at you from all directions. It is artistically very well done. The actor's and actresses do a wonderful job of accurately expressing the struggle everyone, especially women, dealt with during this time in history. I would recommend any young woman to watch this movie, or read this book, to really get an idea and a picture of the struggle of women. I will not put too much more into this review for fear of spoiling too much of the movie. If you are concerned more about the surface and shallow accuracy of the ethnicity of the people playing the charechtors, rather then the message this movie so elegently portrays, just do yourself a favor and dont watch it. But if you truely appreciate art, I would highly recommend this movie, especially to young women who may want to see how women in different cultures struggled.",Memoirs of a Geisha

455,geishainkyoto,Memoirs of a Liar,1,18 January 2007,"Arthur Golden studied in Japan, gathering information for Memoirs of a Geisha, and spoke with Iwasaki Mineko, a retired geiko (geisha). Mineko-san talked with Golden for hours, telling him her life story, answering her every question, on one condition: that she remain anonymous. But Arthur Golden did not keep her concealed. No, at the end of his book, he credited her as his 'inspiration'. But did he stop there? No. He told the public that Mineko-san sold her virginity for a record price, which she did not. Mizuage, which Golden portrays as a ceremonial deflowering of the young geisha, was actually a right of passage where a young geisha's hair was cut. From then on she would wear a wig while performing, and it symbolized maturity. Mizuage was never sexual for geisha. The only time mizuage was a sexual term, was when it referred to Oiran or Tayuu (Japanese courtesans). Perhaps this is a cause of some confusion. But what saddens me, is that Golden, a Harvard grad, had the potential to write an accurate book about geisha. But I suppose he was willing to trade honesty for cash and publicity, like most of us these days. And, because of him, many geisha today must explain to foreigners that their services do not include sex.

However, I could not erase the feeling that the movie missed much of the subtlety that was well manifested in the book. No bias intended - but it seems that Americans have much trouble understanding the complex nature of Asian sentiments. For that reason, I was surprised by the delicate and realistic writing style of Arthur Golden. However, the movie, it seemed to me, desensitized much of the plot. Sure, the scenes were beautiful, and the props must've been prepared with much ardor, but the acting and the story was somewhat ""americanized."" For instance, Hatsmomomo - what was all that with portraying her as a victim? I know that it's too much of me to expect the full exploitation of the text into cinematography, but what was up with those Chinese actresses? Well, certainly, it was a pleasure to watch this movie - a feast of visuals. Nonetheless, I feel that it was nothing more than that. Maybe I expected too much after the book....",Memoirs of a Geisha
459,aevans-4,An aggressively generic film...,5,13 January 2006,"I read and enjoyed Arthur Golden's book, and with that in mind tried very, VERY hard not to let my knowledge of the book cloud my judgment of the film. However, I just can't do it. This film is as pretty and superficial as the book is meticulously researched and moving. First of all, I know, it shouldn't really matter, it's just a movie, but it can't help but create some dissonance having a film that is about Japan be made with Chinese actors saying their lines in English. It's as though someone made a John Ford-style Western starring Koreans speaking Portuguese. It's unavoidable, I know (I mean, I certainly don't speak Japanese) but it doesn't make it less jarring. More troubling is the fact that all of the detail and vibrance and painstaking research that Golden's story hung on is played very fast and loose here. Anybody who has read the novel or knows anything about the Geisha in Japanese culture will find themselves noticing several flaws in the setting and story. Some points, like the fact that the hair and costumes and makeup are never right, are easily over looked. Others, like the change of location (the Geisha district is in Gion, and I really have no idea why they'd change it) are harder to ignore. The story line is fairly true to the book (in actions, if not characters), however there are places where this film drags horribly, and truly there is no excuse for it rather than squeezing in a few more beautiful shots. The film IS breathtakingly beautiful, don't get me wrong, but the beauty cuts short the character development such that they are often reduced to two dimensional stereotypes (ChiYo is brave, Hatsumomo is mean, Mameha is kind, etc) and it makes it very difficult to really care about any of them.Long story short, it's a lovely, fluffy piece of film, but in the end it comes off more as a movie inspired BY Japanese culture than a movie ABOUT Japanese culture.",Memoirs of a Geisha

I didn't need to buy it because I received it as a gift, thankfully. I read it in two days, and last night I had the opportunity to see the film. The book was so wonderfully written, and I had heard great things about the movie, so I had great expectations going into the theatre. I was fairly disappointed coming out of there. At the end of the movie, I sat in my seat, jaw dropped, stunned, and terribly disappointed.Through the course of the film, I started feeling bad about choosing that movie to see with my friend because I felt that it moved really slow, and I actually found myself bored at times. My friend hadn't read the book, so I was afraid she was even more bored than I was. There were major parts of the book left out, and there were some things that were changed from the book. I know, I know, it's to be expected, but some of the things that were changed and left out were crucial to the story.Unfortunately, I left the theatre feeling cheated. I sat through the whole two and a half hours of that movie, and I didn't even get the ending, which was the whole point of the story. I was glad that I saw the twilight show and didn't pay a full ticket price to see it. If they had used the ending of the book to end the film, it may have been worth it. But they didn't. They cut out the end of the book and left you hanging. Even my friend was disappointed with the ending because she felt like there should have been something more. I told her to read the book.Aside from the slowness, the bad ending, deleting key parts of the story, etc, I thought the music, the casting, and the artistic points of the movie were wonderful.If you haven't read the book, you may find it boring.

My husband just came back from his business trip to Tokyo. Among visiting different part of Tokyo, museums and parks, he also had a tour around Tokyo with look into history of geisha culture.

The movie was faithful to the story line and left out things that were not critical to its development. As a Japanese-American, before I went to see it, I wondered about the casting of Chinese actresses in the main roles, but the 3 women seemed to fit very well with my impressions of the characters in the book. By the time the movie was over, I thought it was very well cast.I was surprised at how much of this one aspect of Japanese culture they were able to capture in this movie.

465,celerypanda,Not one to remember,3,30 December 2008,"As a westerner living in Japan I was always going to approach this film with a certain amount of scepticism, especially after The Last Samurai. I am very far from being an expert on Japanese culture and will try to steer away from cultural inaccuracies as best I can. So, I'll start with the negatives. I know, it's becoming a bit of a cliché to say this, but the casting of Chinese actresses was something I knew was going to bother me from the beginning. Why? Because there's absolutely no need to do it. Rob Marshall has only succeeded in infuriating a large part of his audience by doing this. Chinese and Japanese people don't look the same. Even an ignorant white Englishman like me can usually tell the difference. That said, I can kind of understand the casting of Zhang Ziyi, as she is absolutely stunning. I hated those ridiculous blue contact lenses though. Was it a pathetic attempt to westernise the film or a half hearted effort to set his lead character above the other Geisha? Aside from that, the non-Japanese casting was completely unnecessary (despite an impressive performance from Gong Li), there are plenty of Japanese actresses who would have been infinitely better qualified for the roles. For me the plot was poor. Certain areas were rushed, others dragged out. In true Hollywood style it managed to pull a sickly sweet ending out of the bag, which for a film that opted for a slightly sombre mood it seemed very out of place. Rob Marshall has openly admitted changing certain aspects of the film for aesthetic reasons. One or two changes would have made little difference, but general overall feeling that the director has opted for a western view of the east, rather than an accurate portrayal. Fair enough in certain circumstances, but when you're marketing a film as a glimpse into the secretive world of the Geisha you ought to be getting certain details right. An American score, shot on set in America, an American director's film adaptation of an American novel all seemed to detract from the roots of Geisha. I won't comment on the dance at Sayuri's debut aside from saying I hated it and never want to see it again. Some of the dialogue seemed very convoluted, like a young girl saying: ""That would be like releasing the tiger from its cage"", it seemed a little faux-Asian fortune cookie to me! Sayuri saying:"" I want a life that is mine!"" is not only extremely un-Japanese, but from a coming from a Japanese female sold into bondage in the 1940's seems highly unlikely. Oh, and Liza Dalby (responsible for training the actresses to become Geisha), although regarded as the only ever non-Japanese to become a Geisha a never actually formally went through the process of becoming a Geisha herself. More western influence on the film where Japanese influence would have been better. Now, I've had my moan. There are positives to take from this too. Specifically, my mum loved it. And to someone who is prepared to overlook (or not notice) certain inadequacies it can be a very enjoyable film. If you are a sucker for a saccharine sweet plot and fall victim to the typical Hollywood attempts to tug on your heartstrings this could be the film for you. Rob Marshall does do his very best to make this a very visual film, and it is. Extravagant colours, lavish costumes and beautiful girls are all there to wow your senses. For me, style over substance, but at least he tried. One thing I think was done very well, although it has been criticised by a lot of people was the use of Japanese. By throwing in the odd word or two, Marshall tries to remind his viewers that this is Japan they're watching, not the inside of a warehouse in Los Angeles (although it's a shame the viewers need reminding at all). He could have shot it in Japanese, but I think it would have been even worse. If you're going to shoot in Japanese, you might as well use a Japanese director, Japanese actresses, Japanese locations, hell why not use a Japanese story rather than a story about Japan written by an American. This IS an American film after all, and he would risk losing a vast percentage of his audience by shooting in a language they couldn't even begin to understand. Saying that, the English accents were bad (yet another reason he should have used Japanese actresses). I don't mind English with an accent in a film like this, but make sure it's Japanese English.Overall, not my cup of tea. I watched it on DVD and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. I won't be watching it again. But, I can see there are certain positives, and hey, we're all different. My mum liked it and she's impossible tom please when it comes to films. One thing I think you",Memoirs of a Geisha
466,gentinter,Lacking in the necessary emotional punch,5,25 December 2005,"I will start by saying that I have not read the (extremely popular) book that this movie is based on but I came to it with a curiosity about Japanese culture in general and the feeling that this was a subject not yet covered in a Western movie. And when I say Western, I mean Hollywood. Despite the presence of a mostly Asian cast this is aimed squarely at Western audiences (and Oscar voters).The story follows Chiyo (Ziyi Zhang) as her desperate parents sell her into servitude. Eventually she is taken under the wing of Mameha (Michelle Yeoh) who trains her to become a geisha. Jealous rival Hatsumomo (Gong Li) makes life difficult for her all the along way, while Chiyo hides a secret love for The Chairman (Ken Watanabe) who offers her a ray of hope after he first meets her when she is a little girl.Visually the movie is stunning. Colleen Atwood is sure for a nod for her sumptuous costumes and the cinematography is at times strikingly beautiful.However, this can't make up for a strange lack of emotional connection with the lead character. By the end of the film I should have been welling up with tears but felt nothing. The central love story didn't quite work for me; in fact it seemed slightly uncomfortable. The Chairman first meets Chiyo/Sayuri when she is just a little girl and he is at least 20 years older than her but he reveals at the end how he has always harboured feelings towards her. Watanabe does okay with his character but he feels very distant for a large portion of the film so the sudden revelation of his feelings at the end didn't carry the weight it should have done.Gong Li is a superb actress and has an interesting role that leaves the biggest impression.Ziyi Zhang does well in her first fully English language film but she has given better performances elsewhere. Her character is manoeuvred into a position of apparent fame and renown but the extent of this is not well conveyed, so that when the war arrives no sense of loss is felt as all she has gained is taken away from her.The target audience is English speaking hence the decision to have the film in English and using Chinese actresses as Japanese. Would it have been better in Japanese with purely Japanese cast? Possibly, but the movie doesn't fail for this reason. This movie is crying out for a director such as Ang Lee who is able to perfectly handle the themes of repressed emotions and forbidden love. Rob Marshall doesn't do too badly but is unable to deliver the weighty emotional punch that this film ultimately requires.",Memoirs of a Geisha
467,bingobingei,Overall opinion of movie.,9,14 June 2009,"I just watched 'Memoirs Of A Geisha', a novel originally written by Arthur Golden and directed by Rob Marshall. To put in a few words, the movie was emotionally compelling, heart-tugging to say the least.Acting - Simply brilliant. Suzuka Ohgo acting as a young and cute Chiyo, was especially real and the emotions portrayed in her face, her speech, her body language were all communicated clearly and vividly. Their acting allowed me, my heart to enter the world of the Geisha. Special commendation to Zhang Zi Yi who put up yet another sterling performance. This thespian, though playing as a stock, innocent character of the older Chiyo, has left an indelible mark through her acting. I must also acknowledge the likes of Ken Watanabe and Gong Li and Michelle Yeow for their equally powerful and moving performance which contributed to the amazing quality of the show. The hidden sorrows and troubles of the Geisha, as portrayed by Chiyo through her earnest speech and immaculate thoughts induce a strong sense of pity, empathy for her dire situation. Her determination to be united back to the Chairman, despite all her difficulties of her childhood, the troubles and the personal sacrifices she made, was beyond admirable. And I must say Zi Yi is very, very sweet.Photography - Sheer brilliant use of visual imagery. The scene capturing the ground with puddles of stagnant water metaphorically reflects the barren state of Chiyo's heart. In this scene, leaves were also used as a metaphor to represent her hope, which had 'fallen off one by one', which serves to amplify her devastation and bleak prospects, and bring out the injustice which she has undergone. Camera angles were effective and artistic. Commendable.Music - Well-suited for the moment. Creates a range of mood/tone, varying from eerie to an almost false sense of hope, to joy. The slightly whiny and cacophonic quality of the violin and cello (the latter played by the great Yo-yo-ma himself) are reminiscent of a song of lament, of Romeo & Juliet's longing for each other, which obviously represented Chiyo's longing for the Chairman. The melody, fluctuating and with its strongly Asian feel, help to mirror the character's troubles or hopes and allow these to infiltrate and fill the heart of the audience.Of course, the costumes and make-up team should be acknowledged for the amount of effort placed into the intricate kimonos and make-up which adds on to the illusion of entering the Geisha world.All in all, in my opinion, a brilliant movie. A pervading sadness was overwhelming me as the movie was reaching the end, as Chiyo would never seem to be able to reunite with her true love. Almost teared. Made it to my top favourite movie list. Congratulations to all who were involved.",Memoirs of a Geisha
468,GreyStarEmail,"A great film for Culture Buffs or those who are highly ""artistic"".....",9,7 January 2006,"I personally thought this was an excellent movie on many levels. The actors and actresses did an outstanding job conveying feeling and emotion and appearing ""real."" The setting was beautiful as was the cinematography. To be able to view Japan and all its splendor on the big screen, just made me want to visit even more.The story was solid, but dramatic. This is a drama, make no mistake. If you are going to laugh or be scared, this is not the movie for you. If you are going for sex, again, not for you. It's a story about a girl who ends up learning about life, love, and an ancient, almost forgotten, Japanese art form.The cultural references were amazing, both in the speech and in the visuals.I was honestly afraid I'd have trouble understanding it, since most of the actors are Asian, but the English was perfect and I was quickly put at ease. I found myself becoming lost in this film and when it was over, I sat there for just a few moments pondering the differences between my own culture and the one I saw play out before my eyes.The people with me, however, were not so impressed. One of my friends fell asleep three times, the other complained that it was too long, and the third only enjoyed the few dance scenes that were included.I saw it a second time with another friend and he also loved it, but again, me and him both have an interest in Japanese culture and the way of life.... It's a cultural film.... again, great entertainment if you are into that kind of thing. If you're not, I'd strongly advise either staying away or making it a date flick....",Memoirs of a Geisha
469,sabrina_fangchen,"Projects Asians the way an Uneducated Westerner would see them, but is that bad?",6,4 September 2010,"We all know the movie isn't particularly kind to the facts of the real geisha and Japanese lifestyle pre to post WWII. But for this review let's just ignore all of that and focus on the plot, characters, acting, etc.So the plot? There is BARELY any consistent plot being held together throughout the coarse of the movie. Our main character, Chiyo/Sayuri's goal seems to change every 30 minutes whether it be finding her sister (she gives up on that pretty quickly), becoming an admired geisha, humiliating her elder enemy geisha Hatsumomo, winning the affections of a stranger she met once when she was 9, embarrassing another man who loves her, and probably one or two more forgettable ones. And you know what? That also kinda works for me in a messy, high school film project way. None of these plots would hold together for a 2 hour movie so its nice when it changes, even though all of these ideas have been done before. Except this time with Asiiiaaans, which the writers and producers probably thought made them look super creative.In fact, I'm definite they chose this book to make into a movie just to take advantage of creating a film prettier than all the other ones out at the time with its gorgeous (but incorrect) costumes and settings. And thats one of the best positives about the movie. Everything, from the sets to the kimonos, to even the actresses is easy on the eyes and enjoyable to look at.Now My major, MAJOR problem with the movie is the acting. The delivery of the dialogue with its gratuitous English is absolutely cringe-worthy and just sounds like bad acting times 1000. This is excusable considering the majority of the actors are from the Asian film industry and have never spoken primarily English before. But some of these lines couldn't sound believable from anyone. Especially considering that about half the lines are corny metaphors similar to ones you'd expect from a politically incorrect Fu Manchu.Oh, and a lot of the characters are lame too. The only ones enjoyable to watch are the antagonistic ones, in particular Hatsumomo. Her portrayer, Gong Li, is by FAR the best actress in the entire cast. She was evil and sinful as **** but I couldn't help but enjoy every second of her on screen. Even her gratuitous English was well delivered. Dare I say, her performance was Oscar nomination worthy? The rest of the cast? Not much to say other then Blah, blehh, and bluhhhh.... A lot of them I can tell are decent to wonderful actors/actresses but the material they were given didn't let them shine well. It would have fared better if it were a Japan/US film collaboration and let the dialogue STAY IN Japanese so these actresses didn't have to struggle.",Memoirs of a Geisha
470,Eriksrudzitis,The book was way better,5,13 December 2010,"Last month I read the book ""Memoirs of a Geisha"". Now I wanted to see the movie also. The movies was worse than a book. In my opinion in the movie many interesting parts of the book were skipped. When I watched a movie, emotions in the movie weren't as deep es they were when I read a book. The actors in the movie were playing great, but the worse part of the movie was scenario. Too many important places were skipped or not when as deep as that was in the book. Maybe it is because of the length of the movie. If movie director would show all important places of the book, maybe movie would be 6 hours long. But I think it would be better. I recommend to watch the movie and only then read a book, because book was much more interesting.",Memoirs of a Geisha

A worthwhile, spirited and truly engaging piece generally does quite well. This mess will only alienate Asian audiences and cause additional problems between China and Japan where tensions are already running quite high. Fortunately, cooler heads in Japan and CHina will simply let this mess float down the river and into the ocean of non-remembrance. The movie is a racist, insensitive and misguided disaster as was the book. No wonder Hollywood is sinking. It is not surprised that Arthur Golden was sued over the books contents and his actions. A matter which he laughed off.",Memoirs of a Geisha
472,wishingstarff8,Best film this year!!,10,14 August 2006,"I thought after reading the book the film would be a let down, but boy was I wrong! With a brilliant cast, both known and newcomer actors, and a heart warming story its a must buy!! Ziyi Zhang and Michelle Yeoh gave yet another great duo performance after ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"". The part of Hatsumomo could not have had a better actress. Li Gong gave an outstanding performance, playing the mean and manipulative persona down to a T. Ken Watanabe took on a challenging role, the first serious/drama role I have seen him play. A great performance playing the kind and gentle chairman, whom Sayuri adores so much. Other new faces include: Suzuka Ohgo, recommended by Ken Watanabe after playing the part of his daughter in a previous film role. Little Suzuka (playing young chiyo) was outstanding, from learning English to climbing over the top of okiya's. A very emotional performance. Another favorite of mine was the role of ""Mother"" played by ""Kaori Momoi"" Spetacular from start to finish, one of the many highlights of the movie. I'll be keeping an eye out for Kaori's upcoming roles!If you haven't seen ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" yet I'd highly recommend buying it, because once you've watched it once, you'll watch it over and over and over...",Memoirs of a Geisha
473,Didldum,"Moving story, gorgeous costumes, excellent use of music to emphasize the story",10,5 April 2006,"I can't tell how realistic the story really was, I am neither from Japan nor did I live in Japan before/after WWII. But to me the movie was very convincing that this was very realistic. I can't judge the acting, I leave that to the ones who know more about acting, I just thought it was very good (and really enjoyed to see Ken Watanabe again). The costumes were gorgeous and so was the set decoration. I would have loved to see more of Japans amazing, beautiful scenery, but I understand it did not fit into the story and what was shown was really spectacular. I liked the mix of a bit Japanese and English language. English is only my second language and I don't speak Japanese at all but I was able to understand everything even if the English had a Japanese accent. The spoken language was well supported by gestures and the pictures. What really got me hooked was the music which was often used to emphasize the story/the pictures. At the end you feel so deeply for the main character that you really hope for a happy end. The movie appeared to be a bit longer than it actually was but I never got bored and was really enjoying that they managed not to hasten through the story. When the American Army comes into the story, the Americans compared to what was shown as typically Japanese in the movie earlier appeared just to be loud and without good manners. I am not saying Americans are loud and with bad manners but the movie showed well why many Americans must have left such an impression on the Japanese people in that time. Again, no offense meant! I can highly recommend this movie, but don't see it when you are in the mood for an action movie.",Memoirs of a Geisha
474,bunnyville,Not Quite Ambivalent,5,19 January 2006,"I hadn't seen or heard any of the reviews before seeing the movie, but I had read the book. I was disappointed that the film didn't really follow the story line of the book as closely as it could have. I was also disappointed that it didn't really portray the story as a memoir other than the occasional voice-over within the film. The scenery and landscapes were beautiful, but it didn't quite capture Sayuri's sense of being overwhelmed by the beauty of the kimono or the teahouses. Like a lot of other films, some details were sacrificed to make the story fit into a 2-1/2 hour film. Without some of those details, you have no real idea what's supposed to be going on. It was well done for what it was, but it wasn't what I expected.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Were there no worthy enough Japanese actresses to play this role. What if David Chase had selected the French actor Jean Reno to play Tony Soprano? Would that have made any sense? Its funny how so many other comments seems to dismiss this as insignificant. Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger playing ""Americans"" in The Patriot must have been OK with you too. Hollywood just doesn't get it with Asian themed movies yet. Maybe someday they will. Making a movie about something soooooooo Japanese as the Geisha and not having a Japanese woman playing the lead role is a disgrace.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Secondly, and more importantly, Gong Li is easily my favorite actress. Her portrayal of Hatsumomo in this film is average and certainly nowhere near the talent she exhibited in films such as To Live, Shanghai Triad and Temptress Moon.In my opinion this movie lacked a sense of realism. The acting and writing was average. I truly feel that if the dialogue had been delivered in Japanese by Japanese actors, the movie would have been worth the price of admission. Unfortunately the producers hired Chinese actresses to perform a juggling act: portray Japanese characters and culture while speaking English.",Memoirs of a Geisha
477,amberzak,What a real treat,9,5 February 2006,"I watched this at the cinema last night because there was nothing else on. I wasn't expecting much, but I was very impressed.I am not going to give away any of the story, but I was moved by not only the story, but the cinematography too. This Film should win and Oscar for best Art Direction or best Cinematographer (it is up for both).The shots were beautifully done, with a unique style that adds to the fascination of the film. The camera angles are unique and interesting, without being too obtrusive, and the editing is so smooth and clear that you hardly notice it.The film does start slowly, so bare with it, but you will really get into it. Sometimes the language does get a little difficult to understand, and the characters get confusing if you loose concentration, so it may be worth watching twice.Go in with an open mind, and be prepared for a deep film. This is not an action packed, shoot 'em up, bomb filled thriller - this is a high quality film with an in depth story and true characters. This film is style.The characters develop beautifully throughout the film, in a realistic fashion.Worth a watch if you appreciate true cinema - trust me.",Memoirs of a Geisha
478,sarastro_buddy_bbailey,"Well Directed, poorly written. A film like this could have been so much better.",5,20 March 2012,"The Film Memoirs of a Geisha tells the tale of young Japanese girl growing up in the early 19th century as a Geisha. As described in the movie 'a Geisha is a moving work of art, not a peddler of flesh,' and such is the form for which the movie is presented. Artistically beautiful and superbly well-directed, the films creators and actors come together to form a terrifying and tediously boring tale of historical brilliance and forbidden love. There is a list of things that could be better, but to put it bluntly somebody on the list of brilliant film makers didn't get the call. Perhaps, as they were directing and putting together a beautiful set, they figured that the movie would write itself. Evidently not.In regards to the films use of symbolism, I will say nothing in the way of criticism. Effective, to say the least, the director uses this as a way of bringing about a good use of story. In this aspect it is a powerful movie. For example the protagonist has eyes that are constantly referred to as being 'full of water'. Water can be interpreted as being the essence of life, courage, and stubbornness. This is true of the character as well. In the end, when she finally gets the thing she most desires, a man referred to only as 'the chairman', they are seen embracing each other in the reflection of a pond. At one point, her only home and Geisha house is burned to the ground by her jealous rival, Hatsumomo. Fire represents change and destruction. Again the use of elements bolsters the story.The films prevalent theme statement is about the objectification of females, particularly of that time. It is a statement worthy of note, and has been one of enduring quality in the last century. However, such efforts have ensured that feminine suffrage has been accomplished in Western and European society, and will most certainly happen of the rest of the world within a short time. So while the movie brings about a valid point, it is not a point relevant to the world ten to twenty years in the future. Being as poorly written as it is, Memoirs of a Geisha is not a movie of the lasting or 'classic' form. It will not be remembered for very long.",Memoirs of a Geisha
479,kyaroko,Breathtaking from the first scene,9,8 December 2005,"I lived in Japan for 3 years and I loved the book, rich with visual imagery. I went to the see the movie with a good deal of trepidation, convinced that they were going to butcher it and sex it up to appeal to American audiences. Instead I sat spellbound in my seat as I watched the images that Arthur Golden has created in my mind with words years before, play themselves out on the screen in front of me. Every shot, ever scene, every tiny detail was just beautiful. I literally did not look away from the screen the entire time. The acting wasn't spectacular. I think they could have found somebody better to play Sayuri. The children were all wonderful. The stand-out actress by far was Gong Li as Hatsumomo. The villain had the best opportunities to show her skills as a thespian. The plot stuck very closely to the book. They eliminated the scenes that they needed to in the interest of time, but they didn't try to take any shortcuts or speed up the plot. I really felt like the story was played out beginning to end without sacrificing any of the meat. You'll read a lot of reviews in the coming weeks praising the gorgeous photography. Every word is true. Words like ""lush"" and ""exquisite"" only begin to do it justice. I've never had the experience of being transported to another time by a movie in quite this way.",Memoirs of a Geisha
480,davedub,Some serious problems,7,20 May 2006,"This movie was quite beautiful to look at, and it did have some very thought provoking themes, nice acting and direction, but overall I would say this movie falters.Why? Well, for starters, every one is speaking with an accent. If these people were speaking in their native tongue with each other, they would not perceive an accent. If in the movie, the characters are actually speaking English (which they do when communicating to the American officers) then they would have an accent. So as it stands, throughout this whole movie, we are subjected to various actors from all over the world wrestling with a Japanese accent when they should be focusing on acting. And I must say, sometimes it was near impossible to tell what they were saying.Which brings me to the other issue. The story did seem a little hard to follow, especially with the heavy accents. My wife, an avid fan of the novel, was able to keep me up to speed. However, IMHO, a movie should be able to stand on its own and be 'understood' whether or not the viewer is familiar with the source material.Other than that, it was a pretty decent movie, and it is a great story whose potential wasn't fully realized.",Memoirs of a Geisha
481,michaelanthonygeorge,Memoirs of a Geisha is luscious - a wonderful film,9,20 December 2005,"I read the novel a few years ago, and when I heard they were making a movie out of it I was filled with both trepidation (The one of my favorite books might be destroyed on screen) and excitement. I'm glad to say all my doubts have been cast away. Rob Marshall has created a wonderful film.They created a beautiful 1930's Japan. The sets and costumes were stunning. Michelle Yeoh, Gong Li, and Ziyi Zhang all gave startling performances (Especially Ziyi Zhang and Gong Li. They were wonderful) It was amazing.One of the most powerful scenes, I thought, was when Sayuri and Hatsumomo start the fire in the Okiya. At first we see Hatsumomo's reaction - fear. But then she starts throwing the oil lanterns to the floor to feed the flames, and we see her face - you can feel that her world is ending. Pumpkin is no longer the heir to the Okiya, Mother has given her room to Sayuri. She is a destroyed women. Gong Li gives a phenomenal performance.What I especially liked was how they showed the part after World War II - how the Geisha became more and more like the women they despised, the common prostitute. I think Pumpkin best showed this. She was once a quiet, timid girl, but after the Americans came she became a rowdy, sake-drinking, soldier-pleasing ""geisha"". How the American soldiers polluted this important part of Japanese Culture.When Pumpkin finally betrayed Sayuri, and the man she had brought was revealed, the audience actually *gasped*. An audible gasp! Powerful.My only qualms about the movie were, as many have said, the English. It actually turned out better than I expected, but there were still some lines, especially by Ziyi Zhang, that I couldn't understand.I don't think you should go into the movie expecting to be completely accurate. From the production notes (I think they're available on the Official Website), we know that wasn't even their major goal. They wanted it to be a fable, growing larger than life in Sayuri's mind as an old women. I think it worked, and the result was beautiful.",Memoirs of a Geisha

( it's supposed to be masklike) does anyone know why there is three lines left unpainted on the back of the geisha's neck? well... unless you have read the book, or have prior knowledge about geisha, you wouldn't! that's not hard to explain. i'm not saying that EVERYTHING is explained, but basically, you could take the basic plot of this movie, and change the background a bit, and really not lose too much effect. also, the costumes were not correct,(though i do love coleen atwood!) as well as the hairstyles! it was a bit sad, how the look of the geisha had to be manipulated for Hollywood.",Memoirs of a Geisha
483,catwoman69y2k,True to the nature of the book and deeply heartfelt,8,26 December 2005,"I read the book first a few years ago and I was thrilled to hear it was going to be made into a movie. I only hoped that the story would not be altered for the sake of special effects, t and a or anything like that. MoG is not about those things--it is about grace, beauty, matters of the heart as well as cruelty, competition and power.First off, the movie was very true to the book. Much of what was discussed in the book was conveyed correctly in the form of the movie. Only 2 scenes in the beginning were slightly altered from the original book but I think it was a matter of keeping the movie's running time down. Also, Sayuri's dance at the kabuki was a bit overexaggerated (namely the shoes used) or at least it seemed that way to me.The imagery and symbolism was very well done. Meaning was given to the movie with subtle camera angles, setting and mood. The ways of the geisha, both the importance of education as well as the physical presence and demeanor, were very well explained and there was much information conveyed in the movie to show how geishas are a cultured artist rather than a prostitute. Matters of the heart and how it relates to a geisha's life was driven home by the imagery as well as the accompanyment of the narration.I loved watching one of my favorite books come into the silver screen. Some parts gave me deep things to think about after the movie and some parts made me yearn and cry for Sayuri and the road she would travel down. I really lost myself in it and found myself needing to decompress my mind, transitioning back into the world of Southern California. I think when a movie does that for you, then they have done their job.",Memoirs of a Geisha

The characters all badly represented, the actors are not even Japanese and the set is cheap, unreal and definitely doesn't represent Kyoto in Early 20ties and 30ties. Who ever read the book understand that the script writers didn't add any extra value to differentiate the movie from the script. Worse, they even changed the original plot line with a few goofs. Rob Marshall is using for his two main characters two well known Chinese actors who joined before in crouching tiger hidden dragon. Marshall probably saw one Chinese movie and tho they represent Japanese culture. Seeing those two actors together again even makes the movies more ridiculous.

But I felt as though the life seeping out of the Arthur Golden book was completely lost in translation. As an American, I felt Hollywood tends to be rather condescending and will alter anything, despite of its relevance, in order to pack 'em cinema seats. Good job, this film is 100% Hollywood. It also felt as though the beginning dragged and then suddenly it dawned on them that it couldn't be too long and sort of rushed it. The bond between Nobu was completely lost and the impression that Sayuri feels torn about her bittersweet existence never comes across. For those who have not read the book, well, let's just say it was obvious who her benefactor was and that she'd end with him, like a true Hollywood tale. Oh, and let's not forget the cheesy lines. Sayuri's wisdom is clever in print but total chick lit cheese on screen.Overall, the only point of seeing it in the big screen is the beautiful cinematography.

It was so enjoyable that I was sorry it ended and cried for the geisha. The photography was outstandingly beautiful; I hope it was shot on location, because it called to me to go to Japan. The acting was superb--a talented job of casting. There was not the emphasis on the beauty of the kimonos as in the book, though they were mentioned; however, the costuming was very attractive.What happened in the movie was believable, more so than in the book, which seemed like a fairytale to me. Perhaps, it's because the movie ended at a plausible point and did not continue on to life in the U.S.I feel that a ten rating is not extravagant, but then I'm just a poor history prof., and no authority.

488,jgordon-8,A poorly depicted Western version of a highly revered book,3,28 December 2005,"Unexpectedly, a huge disappointment. The trailers for this movie mesmerized me. I sat in awe watching the trailers so excited to see a truly dramatic thriller based on a real culture. Sadly, Geisha just fell plain old flat. I didn't read the book, but from what I hear and from the amount of time it was on the NYT best seller list, it was amazing - and readers could not tell it was written by a white, American man. I was very much hoping for the same thing on film. However, the movie was very much a white, American man's take on another culture. Performance wise - I was happy. The actors were strong, real characters. There were some beautiful shots from the DP and the scenery was beautiful - though I swear half of it was filmed at the Huntington Gardens in Pasadena, CA and not Japan. Call me crazy, but the accents seemed forced. As far as Rob Marshall goes, I really shouldn't surprised. His resume: Chicago (job very well done), Kennedy Centers Honors Celebration (didn't watch it, most people didn't) and Annie (the TV version - didn't see that either but I don't imagine one goes from directing Annie to a story of such depth as Geisha). The story lacked in every way. The beginning where dad sells his daughter was so quick, I really didn't care. I didn't really feel like I got a true look at Geisha life in general from a true cultural standpoint. I more felt that Marshall can't get over his high school baggage and interpreted that through the eyes of dueling Geishas. The entire 2 1/2 hours, which felt like 4, I wished I was watching a Japanese movie with English subtitles. The interpretation was trite, dull, and western. And, while I would never liken the Geisha life to prostitution, it seems that Marshall does. I really wanted to like this movie, but I simply did not. I have a feeling this movie is not going to be included in the memoirs of too many people.",Memoirs of a Geisha
489,andrewjlau,Reminds me of Instant Lunch ramen...,5,14 December 2005,"With all of the negative reviews in my mind as I walked into the theatre, I braced myself for the worst. It turns out that my opinion of the film that seemed to raise so much controversy over casting and language fell in line with neither the vehemently negative, nor the positive accolades of the critics who hail it as one of the best films of the year. Instead, I left the theater feeling ambivalent, not quite sure to sing its praises or to decry it completely.One thing is for sure, the film is gorgeous. There are scenes where the colour seems to bleed off the screen, and some just look like portraits. That being said, the film seems to have forgotten subtlety as a facet of art. Memoirs of a Geisha feels like a distinctly American period film, a fabrication marked by artificiality. Instead of using the actors as a vehicle for conveyance, our eyes are instead drawn to the set design, the framing, the cinematography (at least, for me).Everyone is probably sick of all the discussions about the casting of Zhang Ziyi, Michelle Yeoh, and Li Gong, but I'm going to raise it again. As a Chinese-American, it was strange for me to see three actors who don't look Japanese play the part of the geisha. Additionally, the fact that the film is in English also proved problematic because although Michelle Yeoh's English is quite polished, Li Gong and Zhang Ziyi's English is definitely not. Much of the time, I was struggling to understand what they were saying (a gripe that I've seen mentioned by many others). The inconsistency of the dialogue (e.g., different accents from different characters, sporadic Japanese words during English conversation between characters)detracted from the film for me, because I had to keep asking myself, ""Why is this not in Japanese?"" In the end, the film feels like a cup of instant ramen. It's satisfying and tasty when the hunger pangs strike, but an hour later, you're left wondering why you didn't just go for something a little more substantial than freeze-dried noodles in a broth made from water and MSG. Memoirs of a Geisha is an entertaining film, but I don't think I could sit through it again.",Memoirs of a Geisha
490,banggunking,"A nice visionary, but a poor reflection",6,28 December 2005,"Having finished reading the actual book several hours before I attended this movie I suppose most people could imagine this movie left me a bit disappointed.At the opening of the movie it was soon obvious that this movie would rush through a story that was written ever so detailed in the original book. This story has a fast pace if you're used to the book and you'll find the scenes changing pretty in quick comparison.I think they have chosen quite a good cast. I cannot say anything about the choice of having Chinese actors rather then Japanese. I'm not Asian myself and although I can tell some differences between cultures I think this movie is too fast paced to notice much of it anyway. I do feel however that they should have used Japanese dialogue rather then the English dialogue with Japanese accent. Although Sayuri did move to America later on (which was not filmed in this movie) the choice for the English language feels weird and sometimes was hard to understand in such a way that a few times during the movie I found myself thinking back at the book to understand what was going on. I should note I'm not native American however so it might have been harder for me to understand.The scenes of this movie are however beautifully filmed and as a reader of the book I think the movie did a good job of bringing the visuals and story to life ! I did not for a moment feel bored during this movie, which is also thanks to the fast pace.All in all I think the movie had the right ingredients to make this epic story a true classic even on the screen. But the movie does a poor job of getting the viewer into the story and contains very little emotional elements to pull you in like the book did. I think the biggest mistake was to give Nobu-san such a small role while in the book he seems to be one the key-figures in the story of Sayuri's life (as well as the chairman of course). This was one of the things that leads to the failure of bringing you closer to Sayuri's feelings. The story also isn't 100% accurate (although pretty close). Some of the events that happened in the book were squeezed into different scenes in the movie. And also a few events have been altered a bit to match more with the movie.In the end as a reader of the book I would still advice you to watch the movie since I think the visuals do positively compliment the book. But don't expect this movie to lure you in like the book did. This movie seems better off as an addition to the book rather then being something of it's own ...",Memoirs of a Geisha
491,sarah-460,Excellent,10,17 January 2006,"This movie was so well done. It very closely followed the novel. It also did not chop the book up and turn it into a difficult to follow movie. Not how some novels made into movies are ruined by Hollywood, IE. White Oleander. The movie however does not follow the book to it's end. If you want to learn more about her life the novel by Arthur Golden is worth the read after seeing the film. It provides more details and back ground into the Geisha life style. It is interesting to note the time period of this book/ Movie. Around the 1930's. (This is not a spoiler) out of respect to the people in the book Sayuri would not allow her memoirs to be published until after her death.",Memoirs of a Geisha
492,lb2005,"Excellent, but some parts dragged... a lot",9,2 January 2006,"I went into the movie having read the book, which I loved. Overall, the movie was incredible: most of the actresses were very good in their roles (with a few exceptions), the cinematography was great and the script wasn't too far off of the book.I was disappointed with Ziyi Zhang, who plays Sayuri. She did not seem to break out of her shell, and in some parts she was too quiet and had no real facial expression. I know Sayuri is supposed to be a shy, demure character, but it was killing me to watch her not say anything with a blank look on her face.The movie did drag on however. There were parts where you were watching the sky, or a river, or a garden, and it was all beautiful, except after about 2 hours of gorgeous scenery, your butt falls asleep.The movie did give the book justice (with the exception of one climactic scene), and I recommend everyone see it.",Memoirs of a Geisha

I love every minute of it! If you did read the book like me then just go into the movie knowing it is not going to be the same. Think of the movie as being inspired by the book. There is a lot that is different and you will see it right away but do not get annoyed just try to get over it and enjoy the movie as is. It really is a wonderful movie.

494,nihal_gabr,The book is way better,5,10 January 2006,"I just saw this movie. I had already read the book before and I tell you now, the book is way better. The movie's pace is very very slow, and quite boring at times.Thank God I read the book so I knew what to be expecting and sit for it, however if you haven't read the book you'll be rather disappointed. The movie ignores many details and very colorful insights of the geisha world, that is beautifully described in the book. I understand there isn't enough time in the movie to mention everything,but it came out as a very shallow attempt. The director was much more focused on the set design, the wardrobe and the entire Japanese aura (which he succeeded in nicely), rather than the performance. The other weak point, is that the actors' English was not very fluent and I guess their knowledge of the English language is very little. So the screenwriter had to simply the lines as much as possible and it ended up sounding strangely shallow is such a sophisticated setting. I would have rather seen this movie in the actors own language with English subtitles, instead of this version.",Memoirs of a Geisha
495,michael-lewis-2,too predictable,2,5 April 2006,"All of the characters seemed to me to be stereotyped and wooden. Chiyo/Sayuri is too pure, too good, and very quickly too boring. Mother's character is the compendium of the avaricious brothel madam. Hatsumomo could switch from geisha to any bitchy character in any modern American soap simply by changing costume. The Chairman is the stereotypical good guy. The Baron is the stereotypical rich lecher. Pumpkin, Dr. Crab, Mameha, Auntie -- we've seen them all scores of times in scores of movies, dressed differently perhaps, but otherwise the same stock characters. We know what they are going to say and do long before they open their mouths or move a muscle. The one character with any glimmer of originality and unpredictability is Nobu. But he is not enough to save this movie. I have not read the book. Perhaps the film simply tries to reproduce the story and the characters faithfully. I'll never know. This is not a story that could hold my interest.",Memoirs of a Geisha
496,edgetheow,"She Dances, She Entertains...and the Rest is Shadow",4,5 January 2006,"I tried to watch this movie with an open mind, I really did. Deep down, I was obsessed with liking this movie as much as I had loved the book, and was half expecting to be swept away in its story soon after its opening credits. But Rob Marshall's screen adaptation of Arthur Golden's International Bestselling novel, Memoirs of a Geisha, is a hard movie to appreciate when judging anything other than direction. The movie promises an intimate look at the life and times of one of the most beguiling professions on the planet: the Geisha. However, it manages to fall flat on its perfectly painted face in the process.When I first watched Rob Marshall's Chicago, something very strange happened: I knew that the Best Director Academy Award belonged to him. And you're talking to a huge Lord of the Rings fan here. Still, I believe my emotions were warranted. Marshall took a Broadway hit and kicked it up a million and a half notches to create something highly entertaining and watchable. The Best Picture Award was definitely his for the taking. But there's something very important one has to realize from this: Marshall won an Academy Award for a story that sits only at the surface. Chicago wouldn't be the same if it were meant to be taken as a serious drama. It's a story that relies on its two dimensional nature, whereas Geisha needs to be elevated, developed, and looked at from all angles. Such a thing would have been possible if Spielberg had directed rather than pursuing War of the Worlds, alas, Marshall won the rights to it fair and square.Granted, the dance sequences were well done. In fact, most of the scenes were sweeping and luxurious, relying heavily on the symbolic nature of water to represent the ever changing geisha Sayuri. But Marshall's lack of explanation leads the reader to simply wander like a lost puppy. So as you stare in wonder at Zhang Ziyi's wonderfully performed dance at a Kabuki tea house, you're being slapped across the face later by how much isn't explained about Geisha-life.This is one of the main reasons why the movie fails. Marshall's vision of the geisha is best described with, incidentally, a line from the movie: she dances, she entertains...the rest is shadow. There is a dance and plenty of sequences involving the geisha Sayuri entertaining the rich and powerful. But beyond that, there is only shadow. The viewer is left with nothing but hasty descriptions devoted to geisha culture. For example, when I went to see this, I was with two friends - one who had read the book, the other who had not. Both myself and the girl who had read the novel were forced to explain the details the movie overlooked.And there were a lot of them. Events just seemed to happen without any rhyme or reason. Marshall seemed content with watching a brightly coloured fan spin around in circles. The audience waited for an explanation that never came.But that wasn't all. Geisha life is hard to integrate into a movie because it involves so many facets of society. Explaining all of it would have been arduous and overbearing to the audience. Still, Marshall's script also fails to build any sort of sympathy to the characters, something a lot of people are finding impossible. The story is about Sayuri. The novel takes place from her point of view. So it's very funny to discover that as an audience member, one is more connected on an emotional level with Hatsumomo. Her break down is ten times more enthralling than Sayuri's desire for the Chairman any day.Performances varied. I didn't happen to be overly obsessed with the fact that the three leads were Chinese. All three were perfectly suited for their roles, especially Gong Li who plays the malicious Hatsumomo. She seemed freakishly at home with the role of making a girl's life a living hell. Michelle Yeoh, as well, was flawless as the maternal Mamahe and this performance only made me love her all the more.All in all, the movie had no substance: emotional or historical. But, to return to the geisha analogy, all the film seems to be doing is waving a brightly coloured fan in your face. Marshall was handed the novel - comparable to a lovely, blue-gray eyed girl - and rather than stripping off the layers of kimono to reveal a human underneath, he piled on the silken robes, miles of obi, and so much make-up that at the end of the day, she dances and she entertains, but the rest is unfortunately nothing more than shadow.Leaving.

497,ogotay,Beautiful,10,6 March 2006,"What a fantastic movie! I truly don't understand why (at least at the time of this writing) it only has a rating of 6.7. Maybe there is simply not enough blood and explosions and naked skin in it? With so much crap coming out of Hollywood in the recent years, truly good movies become more and more of a rarity, and ""Memoirs..."" definitely deserves to be placed among the best movies ever made.To describe this movie in one short sentence one could tell it's a story about love. I don't use the words ""love story"" purposely, because - at least for me - the phrase ""love story"" implicates a certain kind of movies which make me run for shelter. ""Memoirs..."" is the opposite of all those banal, stereotyped and painfully predictable melodramas, and it shows one can make films about love which even ""real"" guys ;) can not only sit through but even deeply enjoy. The movie also succeeds in grabbing your attention for its whole duration, only in the last 5 minutes it is getting a bit predictable but still a real fun to watch. An important point in my opinion, since most movies get boring and predictable in the second half and the last third feels like crawling to the credits and to the inevitable ""happy end"". Not the case with this one, the movie stays exciting till the very last moment.Well, last but not least, there are people who give this movie a lower rating because the actors are not Japenese enough for them, or the makers in the opinion of those critics were not able to catch the real essence of the Japanese culture... You know what, if I see a werewolf or an orc in a fantasy movie then it does not lower my enjoyment knowing it's just a human in a costume... And if I want a 100% accurate view of the Japanese culture I always can get myself a history book. When I go to the theater I want entertainment (and maybe some intellectual stimulation ;), and the story and acting in ""Memoirs..."" is believable enough to live up to this goal just perfectly. I loved this movie.",Memoirs of a Geisha
498,RockOperaWizard,Where's the plot?,2,21 May 2006,"As someone who actually read the book, I was incredibly disappointed with the film. It was as if someone cut out 95% of the plot, erased a couple characters, added some stuff that never happened, smooshed together what was left, and slapped on a title. The movie failed to capture the true essence of geisha life in Gion and the inner struggles Chiyo/Sayuri experienced as she reached maturity.The movie is too rushed--the viewer barely catches even a glimpse of young Chiyo and her family in the tipsy house on the water, understanding her roots and her innocence from living in the small fishing village of Yoroida. Her progression to becoming geisha is rushed as well. Once she becomes an apprentice geisha, the movie never allows the story of geisha life to unfold...we never get an idea of what geisha really truly do on a day to day basis.Nobu (who is SUPPOSED to be missing an arm) is an extremely important central character in Sayuri's life, and they completely down-play that in the movie...he's barely in it; his character (as well as all the main characters) is so ill-developed it's sad; same for Mameha. It also fails to portray the various depths of evil and cunning in Hatsumommo--and please, she didn't burn the okiya down...that's just the director's attempt at ruining the plot. And since when did Sayuri learn to speak fluent English to the Americans? Yeah, exactly...Anyways, there are so many issues with this movie that I can't even list them all. My opinion is to skip the movie and read the book. Golden's descriptions are vivid and your imagination will do a much better job than this hack director has done.",Memoirs of a Geisha
499,bettinna13,There's no subtitles due to 10 million Americans being illiterate.,7,17 December 2005,"I had so much high hopes for the film. Critics was raving about this movie, but you can't take critics opinions. They don't read books, they watch films. I loved the book. It's one of the best book I've ever read. I did love the scenes in the movie. It was very beautiful, especially the performances on stage. I was excepting a little bit more of Sayuri playing music. In the book they talked about that a lot and also the kimonos they wore. I had dreamt the movie to be with Japanese actors and with Japanese dialogue with English subtitles. I think it's not so much the fault of movie executives decision for making the film in English as it is Americans' decision for not wanting to read. I mean over 10 million Americans are illiterate. They wouldn't go to a movie with subtitles. Yes people went to see Passion of the Christ and it had subtitles. But, the movie had so much buzz and controversy. The producers knew People was going to see that.Now for Chinese actors playing Japanese characters. I think it's an insult. As a black woman I know the feeling of not being represented up in the screen. Not everybody knows this, in the book Pay it Forward where Kevin Spacey played the horribly burned teacher in the film, well the character in the book was supposed to be a black man that was horribly burned. I thought it was an insult. I just don't understand how the producers couldn't call Denzel or Samuel to play that role. They bring big office hits. I have a feeling they were uncomfortable with an interracial couple on screen. Remember this movie happened before Monster's Ball. There's so much racism going on in the entertainment industry that I think we all need to boycott some of these films.",Memoirs of a Geisha

The book was absolutely amazing and really gave an insight into something so non-American. But watching the movie, American made and Chinese actors aside, it chopped up the book, and changed or left out all of the important details. As a result, the movie is extremely confusing and moves much faster than it should. Many of the circumstances are also affected and confusing because of the changes that were made in other areas. I thought the artistic value of the movie was amazing though, which is where all of my stars come from.

Great story told in the _only_ way it should be told. Although the story is complicated for someone who isn't interested in Japanese culture and history, it's told simply and fully understandably. You'll never get confused or feel lost for long enough to became irritated instead of curious.

503,erinweller,Beautifully done,8,1 November 2015,"Memoirs of a Geisha is a classic love story about a young girl named Chiyo who is sold by her impoverished parents into the geisha district in Japan prior to World War II. Chiyo, the protagonist in this film, is a young girl whom is expected to learn the ways of being a geisha. That idea is squashed temporarily when Hatsumomo, the antagonist and fellow geisha, purposefully gets Chiyo into trouble. Chiyo continues to grow up in this home where she is raised as a slave instead of a geisha for her actions. Then one day, still a young girl, Chiyo encounters a man known as the chairman whom she falls in love with and proclaims at that moment that she will do everything that she can to be with him. This begins her journey into becoming a geisha. Most of the focus of this film is on the emotional aspect and complexity of human relationships. We feel for Chiyo's situation. We want to see her live a better life. She is living the life of Cinderella, an orphaned child living as a slave. She is transformed by different means but becomes the object of beauty. The uses of colors are very important in this film. There are several scenes that the use of color plays a role in the overall mood. For example, when Chiyo makes her debut as Sayuri in the snow dance we see lots of bold colors and shadows in the same scene creating a sense of beauty and mystery. Bold, red, Japanese lanterns hung above the stage, orange lighting behind the audience, and the blue lighting on the stage that shines upon Chiyo all create an intensely beautiful mood. The color blue is significant as Chiyo is told a few times that ""there is too much water in her eyes"" (Marshall, 2005) because of their bluish haze. This is very important to the story because Chiyo says in the first five minutes of the movie that her mother told her that Chiyo was ""like water"" and that ""water can carve its way, even though stone. And when trapped, water makes a new path"" (Marshall, 2005). We see in this film that Chiyo lives her life in this way throughout the film. When Hatsumomo tries to ruin her chances of becoming a geisha repeatedly and somehow Chiyo never gives in to her antics. Pumpkin also tries towards the end of the film and also fails. In the end, this film is not only about finding love but also about perseverance of the human spirit.",Memoirs of a Geisha

I have never seen a movie that goes into so much detail.I'm not sure why they used Chinese actors in a movie about Japanese geisha's, but I thought they were great. No matter what nationality, they portrayed the emotion of the storyline. Sometimes I couldn't understand what they were saying because of their accents, but I could understand enough to get the story.It felt like you were in the movie experiencing the dramas and details of their world. Li Gong was really good, you could feel her animosity towards Sayuri. I hate how the American soldiers completely destroyed the culture there.

The make up isn't the make up of real Geishas at all. Their faces are completely white in reality. The episode of the dance is very graceful and appealing, but I doubt very much this is the kind of dance Geishas do in reality.I read in some newspaper that the more you like Japan, the less you like this movie.

I even love anime.Yes I read the book, but the book wasn't perfect either. When I read it, I felt it needed a little fleshing out. It inspired me to do some research on geisha and I learned about the diff markings/ costumes, etc., but I guess the part that fascinated me most was the discipline and pain they had to endure, which was only briefly touched on in the movie. They were well educated, tireless performers and conversationalists.I expected too much I suppose. No scope or sense of grandeur was given to this story. It seemed overly simplistic and timidly told to placate American audiences perhaps? It neither focuses inward on the depth/emotion of the characters outside of some brief childish outbursts of anger and harsh physical punishment, nor outward on the mysterious world that is Japan in the late 1930s encompassing the geisha with hundreds of years of tradition.It was a reasonable movie, but it showed no heartfelt emotion. There was never a moment where I felt a deep empathy with the character's fear/suffering (outside of the hair styling), nor held my breath in hope for her success.I can't simply call it crap because it hit the marks expected. Here's some surprise, here's some beauty, here's some innocence, here are the harsh realities of life, but let's not show too much or people will be sad, she must be seen as the innocent beautiful victim.It had so many successful elements I can't fully explain my reaction to the whole. The music was good, the actresses were beautiful, (Michelle Yeoh does an amazing job as always portraying the wise and beautiful mentor, the only character with seemingly well earned depth and emotion) the story, surprising/interesting. The directing/cinematography weren't to the level I was expecting, but still solid.I couldn't find that spark of obvious intelligence/defiance in the main character at the right time.

The performances are outstanding, everything about the physical setting and cinematography is breathtaking, and it's emotionally rich without feeling twee or sentimental.The Q&A session also reinforced the fact that, despite this being an American-produced film of a novel by an American author, a great deal of both research, training and supervision on-set went into making, for example, the movements of the geisha as authentic as possible. The issue of non-Japanese actors playing Japanese roles was also addressed - Rob Marshall (the director) stated quite plainly that, as far as he was concerned, he wanted the best actors for the parts - I'm perfectly happy to give him the benefit of the doubt here, as the members of the cast in question acted their socks off.

But with movies, luckily, safe isn't always right, and this risk of a movie is simple gold. Rob Marshall is creating his place in Film with this beautiful piece of art. The movie is literally a visual shock, and certain images still are implanted in my memory. The music by John Williams is just as haunting as the cinematography.

I didn't expect much of it after viewing the trailer, so I wasn't that disappointed afterward. Of course I understand that if they would include every detail of the book, the movie would probably last several hours, but I felt it lacked so much, especially about Sayuri's feelings, that it turned from a beautiful book to a ""nice entertaining little story"". As I mentioned before, I wasn't disappointed because I didn't expect it to be like the book at all, but I wondered if I would have liked the movie better if I hadn't read the book. I asked my boyfriend, who was with me and who hadn't read the book if it was clear how much Sayuri loved the chairman, and he told me it wasn't that clear at all. Also her complicated relationship with Nobu and her desperate act with the American general were not understandable to people who haven't read the book, in my opinion.

I thought the movie would really bring that out but it was too much focused on faces.If you didn't read the book you would not miss what they omitted, but if you've read the book you will realize it's a much better story. Especially about Mameha, the kind geisha who becomes Chioyo's big sister.All in all though, the movie was really lovely. The colors in some of the scenes was transcendent. You wanted to get out of your seat and walk right into that heavenly scene.",Memoirs of a Geisha
516,shakiraizhotness,If I Could give it more than a 10... *Possible Spoilers*,10,1 April 2006,I have a very strong interest in Japanese culture as a Vietnamese person. I find this movie very interesting and breath taking. The whole point of telling a story of a particular person always catches my attention. The thing I love about this movie is the artistic this movie has to offer. The make up is so seductive and gorgeous. The Kimonos has a breath taking appearance and shows pride to the person that wears them. The dance that they do is so artistic and beautiful and always takes to my attention. To me the best part is this movie starts out really sad and depressing but ends in happiness and hope. This movie is so emotional it made me cry when I watched it and I am not a very emotional person. This movie makes me want to see what happens next and each and every scene. The drama in this movie is so great it makes me feel like I am in the character's shoes! It also makes me want to learn more about Japanese cultures and ways of life. I hope this review is helpful to you and I hope you enjoy this movie because this is to me the best Japanese movie ever made ever since The Last Samurai,Memoirs of a Geisha
517,kis0068,From Chinese's eyes,6,22 January 2006,"I have given too much expectation to this movie before I saw it. Some foreign friends recommended it to me, saying ""it is really a nice movie, extremely beautiful!"" However, now I got to know why they like it, but I don't. Probably, there is no difference for a western people to watch a movie like ""Memories of a Geisha"" with major actresses coming from China. But for me, and my friend, it is just to see Chinese ladies wearing in kimono and speaking in English. Although both are from eastern world, Chinese women and Japanese women are totally different. Zhang, Gong, including Yang, who are originally Malayan, are alienated from the society in the movie. Besides, to make dialogs in English is another mistake of the director, especially when there are so many old traditional Japanese women. Actually, Japanese have their own gestures when they are talking, such as nod. But this has been totally changed by speaking English. It is a big problem to film a memoirist which unfortunately makes the audience feel unreal. In my opinion, Zhang is not appropriate for Sayuri. She is beautiful, but too young and wild. Comparing to Gong and Yang, she has not enough feminine charm. As we should admit, Geisha is the art of female. I still remember Greenawy's ""The Pillow Book"", where Vivian Wu gave a fascinating show. It is also a western director trying to perform eastern culture, who has managed to catch my breath. As far as the story to be concerned, it is simply about how an ugly duckling grows to a swan plus an exaggerated love and faith. So, in this movie, I haven't found much art, but many typical Hollywood elements.",Memoirs of a Geisha
518,mariaslanian,See that movie!,10,20 February 2006,"It's been a long time since I last saw such a beautiful movie. ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is a magical fairy tale which gives you a glimpse into another world, a world we could never imagine: so different, so mysterious and so exquisite. I loved it from its very beginning until the last minute. It made me feel and it touched my soul. The music is wonderful and it just makes the feeling so much stronger. The actors are great, and so is the script. It doesn't really matter that most of the leading actors in this Japanese fairy tale are Chinese because their performances are really professional. Ziyi Zhang especially has made a very memorable performance. I recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys deep emotional experience. It's really worth watching ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" so don't hesitate!",Memoirs of a Geisha
519,dancing_nini-1,After young Chiyo is sold to the geisha district she is forced to fend for herself and adapt to the circumstances presented to her.,10,26 December 2005,"Memoirs of a Geisha is my favorite book of all time. And to say that I thought this movie was quite an accurate portrayal of the novel is significant. I was extremely afraid, going into the theater, that the film would completely change what the book meant to me. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie interpreted the novel very well! The costumes, scenery, and other aesthetic additions were all beautiful. As for those who are offended by the fact that Chinese actors played Japanese characters... who cares? That is the point of acting: to take on many different roles (which includes playing roles of characters of different nationalities!!)! I strongly recommend this beautiful, compelling, and captivating film to both those who loved the book and those who didn't have the pleasure of reading the novel (although i also urge you to read the novel). And I also hope that you don't go into the movie with overly critical eyes (obviously everything cannot be perfect for everyone).",Memoirs of a Geisha
520,teddyhamedani,Simply Wonderful,10,11 July 2006,"A visual delight and with brilliant acting and a wonderful story to match, Memoirs of a Geisha is a cinematic masterpiece and one of my favourite films. Set in 1930's Japan this film portrays the life of little Chiyo, (Ziyi) and her rise from a maidservant to the most famous and desired Geishas in the whole of Japan. The whole film is mesmerising from start to finish and the story beautifully told, with the transition from book to film seamless.The book and film educated me about the art of Geisha, something which was completely different from the stereotypical views i had in my mind. This film leaves you feeling happy and very satisfied. Highly recommended, Ziyi Zhang and ""Hatsumomo"" are beautiful!",Memoirs of a Geisha
521,culanquyt,based on the book,2,4 December 2005,"Unaccurate depiction of Geisha and the culture of Japan. Main characters (Sayuri and Hatsumomo) did not deliver strong acting. Hatsumomo totally lacked the cunningness and smartness of one of the most popular geisha of her time (well, maybe it is the script's fault, not the actress). Chairman was good in displaying his quiet love for Sayuri. Mameha was graceful as a leading geisha. The rest of the cast were attractive, esp. young Sayuri - a promising star. Deeply disappointed overall (after all the publicity and expectations)! My guess: it's not going to make it to the Oscar Nomination and will be a disappointment on the box office.",Memoirs of a Geisha
522,ozziea-1,A beautiful film in every way but one,4,9 December 2005,"I saw Memoirs of a Geisha at a WGA screening just before it premiered. There was a Q&A with the screenwriter afterward but I chose to leave before it started for one reason - I felt bad for the writer; the script of this film could have used a great deal of tightening before the final production version. This is a pity for this film is endowed with exquisite cinematography, outstanding performances, and a wonderful score. But all this does not hide the fact that this nearly three hour long film is nothing short of a ""novela""  a soap opera that runs its course. All the tension is watered down by a misguided lack of emphasis on key characters  the Chairman; the character that propels the story is so underwritten that we cease to care long before the final outcome. This not a spoiler - less than halfway through the film the plot is obvious and not really relevant. Perhaps it is unfair to pin blame on the scriptwriter for this is collaboration among some of the best talents in the industry - Marshall, Spielberg - should have wrought more, a lot more. But this makes the question even more irresistible  what where they thinking? The whole issue of Chinese playing Japanese is not a minor issue. Having worked and lived in both countries the differences are as obvious as those between a Spaniard and an Irishman, even a dark haired one. But this issue reveals what was perhaps some intense behind the scenes dilemmas faced by the producers. Just one of several misguided choices in what could have been an excellent film. In spite of all the problems, you will learn a great deal of the life of a geisha. Historically, this is worth watching. Also if you want a feast for the eyes and some of the best performances of this year, especially by female actors, don't miss this film.",Memoirs of a Geisha
523,eskimauxpie,Give me back my $11.50.,5,12 December 2005,"The dialogue is excruciatingly bad, and the embarrassment of having to listen to it is made a hundred times worse by the pseudo-Japanese-accented English the otherwise talented actors and actresses are made to speak.Another thing. I'm not one who usually cares about making the movie just like the book - literature and film are different mediums and what works for one may not work for the other. Especially here - no one could expect the movie to capture all the subtleties of the story as told in the book. As long as the movie is good, it doesn't matter if its not the same. But in this case, the movie is BAD. The characters are not developed, the film doesn't convey any strong sense of their motivations or desires, the audience is not made to understand them, so in the end everyone just seems slightly ridiculous.",Memoirs of a Geisha
524,speedingticket,Are you kidding me?,3,16 December 2005,"Yeah, maybe it's a beautiful picture, but come on! The 3 main female characters in the movie were all freaking Chinese, speaking English! How could a movie consider a great film, if it can't even meet some simple basic factors? I would rather watch a movie with subtitles. This is some thing I can't take it when Americans watching Asian movies. People don't know jacka** about Asian culture, only through some books and reviews, so they thought they know everything, so they come out and saying this is great, that is brilliant. Truthfully, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was a piece of crap, as a Chinese I felt offended when it won so many Oscars. My Japanese friends were totally confused after they watched The Last Samurai, they were like, no Japnese Samurai speaks English, and they were all using guns back then. So if Americans think this is a great film, with great actors, I think it's just funny. And people laughed at Tom Cruise in Last Samurai, at least he was great in that movie. a Japanese film here?",Memoirs of a Geisha
525,underdogeast,Asians do NOT all look alike and the people in this movie LOOK Chinese.,1,16 December 2005,"I really wanted to boycott this movie from the get-go, but since I loved the book, I gave in to seeing it last night. I feel like I can now give sound advice to everyone out there - BOYCOTT!!! When I found out that the cast is primarily made up of Chinese actors, I was immediately put off. It just doesn't make sense! I am korean-American and it kind of infuriates me to know that a lot of people(almost all whites) have no issue with this. Please THINK about this for one second. When someone says that there is no difference in this situation, as when an Australian plays an American, or when Queen Latifah plays big momma in Chicago, I want to kill them. I don't think that they realize that they are demeaning asians in general. Let me tell you why...An Australian can play an American in a movie because they both pass as whities because THEY ARE BOTH WHITE! Queen Latifah playing big momma in a f**king musical is not even something to discuss. Memoirs of a Geisha is a physically and culturally specific movie. Ask yourself why the cast of this movie, or better yet, The Color Purple, couldn't have been all white... BECAUSE IT WOULD LOOK RIDICULOUS!!! Now, let me get to my BIG point to all you idiots out there - ASIANS FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ACTUALLY DO LOOK DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER!!! - And I hope you are reading this ROB MARSHALL(white director). While I was watching the movie, all I could think was, ""Uh they're Chinese. Is anyone else noticing this and wanting to vomit?"" Not to mention, the movie should've been done in Japanese with subtitiles. It seemed ridiculous for them to be speaking English...especially saying s**t that even I would never say(I only speak English). Then I realized that they wouldn't be able to do that because the cast is Chinese! Rob Marshall has turned this amazing book into a joke on the big screen...shame on you",Memoirs of a Geisha
526,mcdowlm,Read the Book Instead,2,3 January 2006,"Those who loved the book will, at the least, be disappointed; those who didn't read the book will be lost and disappointed. Those who made the film were lost, too, and must have left more on the cutting room floor than made it to the screen. Frankly, I don't know why they bothered.The geisha in the film are not Japanese, do not look Japanese, do not move like Japanese. Since the geisha is the epitome of traditional Japanese feminine beauty, and since that's the crux of this film, these failures are not minor. The kimono, make-up, hair, ornaments, manners, dances, and movements are vitally important details to creating this uniquely Japanese beauty (and are well known to the readers of the novel, which feasted on these details), so they should have been accurate. Sadly, they are not.I'll just give you two startling examples: 1. The film's geisha make-up is atrociously inaccurate and Westernized -- false eyelashes, over-painted lips, under-painted faces (barely white at all, not the dead white of a real geisha's formal appearance).2. The hair styles are not only inaccurate but, at one point, laughably wrong. The young Saiuri is trying to sell her virginity to Dr Crab while wearing a hairstyle that is worn only by novice geisha (maiko) who have ALREADY LOST their virginity. Every Japanese and every Western reader of the novel will notice. Sigh...I noted only English names in the credits for hair, kimono, makeup, choreography... Why? What kind of sense is this? The filmmakers would have done far better to have used real geisha and Japanese costumers, designers, stylists, etc. The cast which they gave us can act, no question (I've seen their other work) but have been given little or nothing to do here. They are largely cardboard people wrapped in badly designed silks who live without any humor, gaiety, grace, or satisfaction. When, near the end of the film, Nobu declares his obsession with Saiuri, we're surprised -- we haven't seen him in ages, and we haven't seen any obsession, either. When the Chairman declares his love for the same Saiuri at the end of the film, we're too bored to be surprised. We just want it to end.The one standout performance, the one character that almost makes it intact from the book, is Pumpkin. But even her ""motivation"" for betraying Saiuri is contrived -- if you had blinked about 30 minutes earlier, you might have missed it altogether. The big scene where Saiuri is declared daughter of the okiya is so mishandled that Pumpkin's anguish is literally shoved off-camera as the snarling Hatsumomo rampages about the little room, tossing furniture and curling lips at the same time.I cannot recommend this film to anyone who read and loved the book; I cannot recommend it to anyone who has not read the book. Save your money and go see Narnia instead.",Memoirs of a Geisha

528,lotis17,Great poignant movie,10,24 December 2005,"This movie has the most beautiful costumes and scenery I've ever seen of the old days in Japan. The plot is a really touching story from the beginning to end. We learn of the hardships parents went through and were forced to sell their daughters so that things can work out for everyone. The protagonist, Sayuri, was treated as a servant until she grew older and became educated into the geisha trade. Then she became the most alluring and wanted geisha known. This intriguing tale let us see the process of how one becomes initiated into this mysterious trade. Now I am excited to learn more about this. This movie was ""based on"" a geisha named Iwasaki, and she actually writes the real story in her book, Geisha, a Life. Nonetheless, I'm very happy that a movie like this was made, because there is no other Hollywood film that would even come close to it. I saw it with my relatives and we recommend this film to mature audience.",Memoirs of a Geisha
529,nutling2,"Totally Unsatisfying, if not almost boring",4,26 December 2005,"I saw ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" last night, and having read the book before watching the movie I was mostly disappointed. Although the director, Rob Marshall, attempted to stay as close to the novel as possible, the film didn't do the book justice in its eloquence and depth. It was a long movie, but it didn't feel like the time was well-used to develop each character enough that we could truly feel for them.There were only two memorable scenes to me: Sayuri's dramatic performance in the annual production, and the moving, closing scene. Other than that the movie seemed to lack substance--and it even failed as some loosely interpreted, but entertaining blockbuster rendition of a well-received novel. Perhaps the director should have spent less energy on being ""true"" and more on providing something that was watchable. I felt guilty as I watched my boyfriend nodd off beside me.In addition, the movie seemed almost dishonest. At first I dismissed the critics' claims about the lack of authenticity due to the heavy Chinese cast, but it's true. Because of its big name Chinese actors all I could think was ""Joy Luck Club (Tsai Chin as ""Auntie"") and ""Crouching Tiger"" (Michelle Yeoh/Ziyi Zhang). I felt the resulting Chineseness overshadowed the sheer fact this movie was a story of a Japanese girl. I've seen plenty of movies before where actors took on roles that required them to be other races, but in this case it just didn't work.Unsatisfying: that's what you get with ""Memoirs of a Geisha"". If you want something good go read Arthur Golden's bestselling book.",Memoirs of a Geisha

When compared to the book, however, it seems lacking a lot, and it isn't just the standard ""bad-book-to-movie"" excuse, a lot of scenes seemed rushed and pieced together. I'd venture as far as to say you might not completely understand the film if you hadn't read the book (which is phenomenal, go check it out for sure).The casting is excellent, the music is excellent and the filming and directing is superb. Again, the only issues were a feeling of a rushed script. And some facts were changed around, but whatever.Worth a see, for sure. -J",Memoirs of a Geisha
531,rancidl,Don't waste your time,1,25 December 2005,"I've read the book and have had a large amount of my studies in university devoted to Japanese history. Not only did this movie disgrace Japanese culture, ethnicity and subtleties - but also the Chinese by hiring them to play Japanese parts. It seems that America has received little word from Asia and how the media has been so negative towards the movie, both from Chinese and Japanese alike. It also seems that we forget our history about Japan and Chinese, and their somewhat distaste for the other. Well, it seems they not only angered some Asian cultures but also Americans - everyone in the cinema was laughing at very unfunny scenes. I do not blame them at all.If you've read the book, you wonder why they left out so MANY important details about the culture, about her predicament and about her love interest. If you haven't read the book, you may miss important facts because you're unable to understand the English through some very thick Chinese accents. In fact, you miss every important fact, because it wasn't in the movie at all.Not a single person in the audience connected with the lead or any other character and were laughing at them, and of Japanese culture in general. This movie was trying to portray a fairy tale, but did exactly the opposite. It disgraced many and confuses me as to WHO the producers wanted their target audience to be? Chinese dislike the actors being hired to do Japanese roles - the Japanese dislike the Chinese actors being hired to do Chinese roles - and the Americans laughed during the movie.They left out so much culture that was important for the viewer to even empathize with the lead character. Nothing was clear to the audience and in response, they laughed. Some people left during the movie and others at the end said to their friend, ""next time, I'll choose the movie"".I'm amazed that the producers and director had the audacity to do things to make other cultures angry at this movie, leave out every single detail that would be important and expect Americans to love it.",Memoirs of a Geisha
532,paulinem81,Good but not Japanese enough!!!!!!!!!,7,26 December 2005,"I read the book and saw the movie. Rob Marshall did a good job and followed the book really well. The costumes were beautiful but let's face it, this is a movie about a Japanese geisha. The whole movie and the book describe the lives of a geisha, Sayuri, right before World War II. I would have liked to see a Japanese actress playing Sayuri. Ziyi Zhang is beautiful in a kimono and she's a good actress but she's not Japanese. I'm sure there are plenty of Japanese actresses who could have played the role of Sayuri and made the movie more authentic. The movie is entirely in English. They throw some Japanese words here and there and having read the book, I knew what they meant but I'm sure some people in the theater had no clue what an ""okiya"" or an ""obi"" meant. Bottom line: You make a movie about a geisha in Japan, you should pick a Japanese actress.",Memoirs of a Geisha
533,mojoe987,Excellent Film,9,26 December 2005,"Just something which made me smile about the review above this one... and I quote...//I cannot comment on either topic, since I know little or nothing about Japanese tradition and I don't know why Ziyi Zhang, Michelle Yoeh and Gong Li were cast. They have been seen before by American audiences, but are hardly film stars in this country, so it wasn't as if they were going to draw in tons of fans on their names alone.The only thing I can think of is, all three are fine actresses and they more than proved that in this film. If Gong Li does not get a best supporting actress nomination, there's no justice. And Zhang should probably get a crack at best actress for her work, as well.All three just light up the screen.\\ I think you have answered your question quite well unwittingly. All three are excellent actresses, Ziyi Zhang for instance has proved herself an excellent and extremely talented actress in Hero, Crouching Tiger hidden Dragon, and House of Flying Daggers to say the least. The others, too many films to mention. All three well deserve to be cast, not only are they extremely talented and have been cast in many excellent films, they are all also extremely pleasing to the eye hehe.I couldn't write a better review of the film if I tried, except to say I found it intriguing rather than complex, and an excellent change from the boring and quite frankly shameless excuses for movies Hollywood has been pumping out on mass scales for many years now. Whos lack of any real plot and willingness to take a chance on being a worthwhile film with something new to offer is as obvious as there overuse of spacial affects and 'cool' characters from comic books, and popular story's.

I think that if the movie contained more information, as the book did in how the story actually started and how the story actually ended, it would have given more the to the viewers that did not read this book. I also think that there were a few other areas where the viewer could be lost. I had to explain the story to a few people because they did not understand what had happened in the middle of one scene to the next for some parts of the movie.

Before I went to see it, I read the critic's reviews which said it was a basic romantic love story. Wrong! (which leads me to wonder if they read the book and understood the subtleties that were still present in the movie) Another problem I have is the American's belief that the geisha is a prostitute which is not true. I thought this myself but the book soon dispelled that notion. I recommend reading the book as it will make the movie slightly easier to understand. Nevertheless, the movie is still very moving and enjoyable. It follows the book nicely. I heard someone behind me after the movie was over say ""That was great movie.""

536,bitter_range,highlights of memoirs of a geisha and what it lacks,8,28 December 2005,"Memoirs of Geisha was good but not great. I liked it for the stunning visuals and the Japanese music but the storyline wasn't that impressive. I didn't like how Hollywood dramatized the whole geisha experience. The movie doesn't adequately portray the enigmatic world of the geisha, I don't feel their world coming to life. Sure, the imagery was vivid and the kimonos were lovely, but it was lacking. Everything was just thrown out for the audience to somehow make sense of. The movie only focused on two things: Sayuri's journey to become a geisha and her love for the chairman. The years after she became a geisha and before the war was also omitted; her dannas, her debauchery and affairs were omitted as well.Plus Hollywood turned it into a love story between the chairman and sayuri whereas the book concentrates more on her life and the lives of the geishas around her. Zhang ziyi gave a good performance, but I just don't feel that she looked and acted the role of geisha well. And Hatsumomo's character was too flat. In the book, her suffering was more apparent and I don't recall her trying to desecrate the okiya. Also, Sayuri came to kyoto when she was nine; when she met the chairman on the bridge she was older than that but the same actress played sayuri so it seemed like she fell in love with a 40+ year old man when she was 9. If you haven't read the book, the movie would be confusing. Sometimes the characters converse in Japanese without subtitles. A lot of the geisha tradition was not explained, so unless you have read the book, it can be pretty tough. Overall, it's a decent movie, but it could have been better. I especially liked the debut dance. It was very scary/beautiful. Compared to the novel, the movie is more romantic and fantasy-like, as expected of a Hollywood adaptation",Memoirs of a Geisha

If you insist on seeing wait until it comes out on DVD so you can stop it when you realize how bad it is. But one thing, the main actress wasn't too bad... I wish that people wouldn't rave about this movie seeing as how it wasn't great. all it focused on was some kimonos (spelling?) and 'competition'. although i find Japanese culture fascinating this movie didn't show me the Japanese culture impact i had hoped for.",Memoirs of a Geisha
538,vrabche,"Brave, beautiful, intelligent, complex and deeply moving film.",10,30 December 2005,"I loved it. I found it to be a beautiful, complex and moving film, and, above all, a very honest and courageous statement about geisha, and women and oppression in general. I went to see a colorful fairy tale of other places, people, times, and cultures. Instead, I felt shaken out of my complacency in my comfortably distant location and drawn in by the dark opening scenes. After that, I could no longer be the unconditionally innocent and dispassionate observer. I became emotionally involved in a disturbing story that seldom gets to be told. I was not just entertained. I was deeply touched by its humanity. I came out of this movie with haunting questions: Poor Japanese families sell their girls to become geisha and prostitutes. How about the girls in Thailand, Africa, and Eastern Europe that are similarly trafficked? How about the girls in this country who may be doomed to a similar fate? Of course, we have no geisha but what about the girls that are molested at home, sold to older polygamous men, driven to prostitution by poverty, enculturated in slavish ideals and trained for a lifelong unquestioning servitude to men? That's now. And how about the ""s"" word of our not so distant collective past? Who cares about that? Rob Marshall cares. Instead of pandering to the male-dominated film establishment and the predominantly male adolescent viewers, he brings women to the fore. Furthermore, he does not exploit popular geisha myths about mysterious faces, pretty kimonos and glamorous connections to satisfy popular biases. He goes far beyond that surface glitter, to the very depths of the geisha world, both through individual and common tragedies. There's the glamor of irresistible good looks and artistic accomplishments. But there's also the poignancy of separation, loss, sacrifice and pain. And, most importantly, there are the limits: In geisha world, the tallest dream is to be sold to the highest bidder. Here's a young director who, in his second movie, dares to rip open the cinematically, socially and politically untouchable and unspeakable. He does so masterfully. He blends darkness and light, childhood and adulthood, dance and torture, friendship and betrayal, compassion and cruelty, rise and fall in a passionate defense of human dignity for the oppressed. And by doing this, he takes an enormous risk. For that, he has my respect and admiration. For me, everything worked: the story, the acting, the photography, the choreography, the lighting, the sound effects, the editing, the costumes. The most moving film since ""One Flew over a Cuckoo's Nest,"" ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" rekindled my own memories of womanhood and womankind. It's definitely my film of the year!

541,mnordeen,Highly Recommend Memoirs of Geisha,9,31 December 2005,"I saw this movie with my 23 year old niece. We have very different movie preferences but had both read the Memoirs of a Geisha book and wanted to see the movie very much. We both loved it! I think that having read the book allowed the movie to bring the story to life for us both. I know, for myself, I felt breathless through most of the movie as I watched the scenery and characters appear very much as I imagined them. I did not want to miss a second of the film. There were some minor inconsistencies between the movie and the book but when I think about it - it is not reasonable to expect a book to be recreated on the screen word for word. So if a scene or character was slightly changed here and there, I understand, but that is why I gave it a 9 out of 10. I would have loved for the movie to be even longer so they could fill in every detail.",Memoirs of a Geisha

It will ask you how much you truly love your life-mate and what you are willing to do for him/her.Finally, it will leave you in tears (men and women) as a secret as mysterious as japan's culture itself is revealed to you in ""The Memoirs of a Geisha"".",Memoirs of a Geisha
543,tjnyc,This is insult for Japanese culture,1,1 January 2006,"Since nobody confess the real feeling of Japanese, I have to tell you the truth. This movie is totally derision for Japanese culture. If the film maker wants to say this is a fiction and love story, they should not have used the Geisha topic as the entertainment stage.First, I have to ask the director why he did not hire a Japanese art director who would not create absolutely untruth interior architecture and furniture, and not make funny hair and Kimono style. Japanese never wear Kimono making the right side in front until they die.Second, the director misinterpret Japanese delicate feeling for love. It is necessary to make a supplementary comment that when the Chairman met with Sayuri, he had got married and had children, and even after this movie he may not get divorce but love her each other. I am sure many Americans feel an ethical problem on that, but Japanese at that time should feel purity for their love. I guess this is the most difficult part for many Americans to understand the uniqueness of Japanese culture.In conclusion, this is the best movie if you want to know how the movie director and his staff do not distinguish not only Japanese culture but also Japanese faces from Chinese and Korean one. I am ashamed that Sony and several Japanese actor/actress participated this movie.",Memoirs of a Geisha
544,orla-mardin,Great opportunity missed,1,1 January 2006,"Having lived in Japan for several years this movie does not reflect the Japanese culture and does not even come close to explain what being a Geisha is all about. Unfortunately, a great opportunity has been missed to bring the Japanese culture a bit closer to the broad Western audience and help demystify the country where Zen, Samurai, the Geisha world of Kyoto originate from. Some of the most poignant moments of the movie are when the Americans are shown in Japanese surroundings.The Geisha dances were not authentic. There was far too much use of Chinese music. A minor but essential detail: proper use of the incense sticks was nowhere to be seen. The Sakura scenes were almost obscenely kitschy ! Interestingly, some of the Chinese actors were quite convincing as Japanese persons.",Memoirs of a Geisha

546,emilyray2,An insult to the book,1,2 January 2006,"""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is one of my all-time favorite books. I have waited anxiously for several years for the movie to be released, and was greatly disappointed. Though the photography and soundtrack are magnificent, they do not make up for the disappointing screen adaptation. Too much ""poetic license"" was taken, and in my opinion, the movie is not a ""worth-see"". I cannot understand why screen-writers take wonderful books and change them to suit their own personal agendas! Other readers of the book that have seen this movie share in my opinion. I do recommend the cinematography, it is glorious!Perhaps, the movie would have flowed better had it not been in narrative form. Also, it took me a while to adapt to the accents of the cast. At times it was extremely difficult to understand what was being said. Suyuri was a little weak, although very beautiful. The book portrays a stronger character, especially as she ages. In my fantasies, I would love for this movie to be remade with a stronger cast, and following the book more closely.",Memoirs of a Geisha
547,jandmchan,Excellent Work on a Complicated Book,9,3 January 2006,"The movie is visually beautiful and the cast does a great job telling the story of Sayuri. The movie should spent more time developing the relationship between the Chairman and Nobu, as well as more time to explore the extremely difficult training required of a Geisha. Since the movie is already 145 minutes, perhaps adding another 15 minutes would bring out more of the flavor of the story. The LOTR movies are each more than 3 hours; would anyone want to see the LOTR movies shrink to 2.5 hours? Much of the flak is regarding Chinese Actress playing the Geisha roles. There are so many people writing they can tell the Chinese actress, being not Japanese, cannot adequately depict Geishas. This is like as if we can all walk down the street and immediately able to differentiate between Japanese Americans from Chinese Americans. Unless there are ESP powers I am not getting, I do not believe in this misguided logic. Please just enjoy this beautiful movie and the wonderful work done by the cast and director. Gong Li should definitely get an Oscar nonomination for her work.",Memoirs of a Geisha
548,dame_sorren,"As usual, the book was better . . .",5,3 January 2006,"If you only knew, dear readers, how long I have waited for this movie to open. And then, alas, I felt cheated. The book, it was a masterpiece. The movie, it was a big let-down. The reasons I didn't like it were not for the usual ones being bandied about, that being the casting (I think the actors were wonderful, no matter their ethnic background) and length and such. It is the simple fact that the movie was hopelessly shallow and empty of the feeling portrayed in the book, even if it was really nice eye candy.I think some well placed explanatory inner monologue about the things shown in the movie would have capture the feeling of the book better, for one, as the story is one told from strictly Chiyo/Sayuri's point of view. A person who did not read the book or knows nothing about Japanese or geisha culture would not know, for instance, the meaning of all the rituals and nuances of geisha life, or that prostitutes were distinguished from geisha easily by the fact that their obi was tied in the front (among other things). Sorry, socially boring prattle I went on there.I also think that the relationships between Sayuri and almost everyone in her life were misrepresented. In the book, Nobu and Sayuri have a much deeper friendship than what is shown in the movie, almost to the point that some people might cheer ""go for Nobu, you silly girl!"" if they really knew the whole story there. It really makes it hit home exactly how much Sayuri and the Chairman gave up, messed up, and had to rearrange their lives to be together.The man who originally sold Chiyo and her sister, Mr. Tanaka, is such an important character in the early stages of the book in Chiyo's life, yet he is no more than a dark figure driving a wagon in the movie. Why, oh why? Well, at this point I could list every character and the stuff that was cut out of the movie about their dynamics and influence on Sayuri's life, but then you'd all want to strangle me for yammering on (like I haven't already).The summary of my little rant here is this advice. Read the book, and wait for the movie to hit the video stores.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Before reading the book or watching the movie, I thought a geisha to be a prostitute. This story displays a geisha as an elegant, feminine woman that lives her life to entertain men in a beautiful way. The actors and actresses did a perfect job of portraying the characters. I enjoyed seeing new faces. I would recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a film addressing a different culture and lifestyle in a very poignant way.",Memoirs of a Geisha
550,user-3659,Proves that a book is superior to a movie,7,4 January 2006,"After reading the book, I had high expectations for the movie. Maybe that's where my problem began. Expectations can be a dangerous thing after all.Don't get me wrong, Memoirs of a Geisha is not a bad movie, no where near in fact. Its portrayal of a rapidly diminishing world not only seem natural, it's rather beautiful. I remember a few days ago before i saw the film, I was looking at some of its still images. I remember thinking to myself how remarkable it was that what i saw almost resembled exactly what was in my head from the book. When i saw Gong Li for example, i knew straight away she was Hatsumomo (apart from Zhang ZiYi and Ken Watanabe, i didn't know which characters the other actors portrayed at the time), it was uncanny. I guess this was an important event that propelled my expectations to perhaps unreasonable heights.One of my first gripes was the language problem. Now stop ringing those racism bells, I'm Chinese myself. The fact of the matter is, this should've been filmed in Japanese. I don't care what the hazards were, what limitations they had, they should've made it their number one priority. It's a waste to use actors who aren't using their mother tongue, no matter how brilliant they are, because depending on their knowledge and experience of the language, a person's personality and behavior changes on some level when switching between languages which affects their acting since they are foreign to its expressions and nuances. This means that their acting deteriorates, but more importantly, their characters seem less genuine and believable. The three main Japanese female roles were all taken up by by Chinese actresses. This was a problem that could only be solved by, well...replacing them with Japanese actresses, because even if you got them to speak Japanese, it would still look awkward (and for the Japanese viewers, sound awkward as well). You certainly can't have them speaking Chinese, so casting them was a mistake from the beginning. I admire these actors greatly and considering the language and cultural barriers, they did a remarkable job so I'm not placing the fault on them, but rather on the casting crew. I simply can't imagine that they couldn't find a single Japanese actress suitable for the roles. It was perhaps due to this that i was alarmed to find many characters feeling more like imposters. One standout would be Kôji Yakusho who portrayed Nobu. Not only did the director saw fit to diminish his role to almost nothing, Mr. Yakusho's own portrayal of Nobu was pitiful. He removed all dignity and pride from Nobu's character, which was a shame as Nobu had a very strong presence in the book.Needless to say, the movie made a few cuts from the book to insure a reasonable length, and personally i found the cuts to be quite acceptable (even though the movie still felt rushed). However, when they changed some events completely (presumably to save time by combining certain events into one), it sacrificed what the author tried to build up in order to paint a more complete picture of the characters. They are mainly subtle things, but important nonetheless. For example (spoiler alert!!), when Hatsumomo was thrown out on to the streets utterly alone, it was because she went berserk at a function in which she served due to Mameha's witty remarks and actions (but also from a lengthy build-up beforehand which lead up to her final outburst). It was unexpected, but acceptable. In the movie, she tried to burn the whole okiya down first accidentally and then purposely, which seemed unbelievable since the movie did not portray her at that time to be out of control. She then left, more to escape than to be physically forced. This change not only omitted a display of Mameha's wit, it showed Hatsumomo to be less helpless, mentally unstable and alone than to be simply, spontaneous and independent. One incomprehensible change was when Mameha admitted to Sayuri that she lied to everyone about who really won Sayuri's mizuki auction due to her relationship with the Baron. The movie portrayed her as someone who would give in to her jealousy whereas the book portrayed her as someone beyond all that. The book's explanation was perfectly acceptable, in that the Baron's interest for Sayuri's Mizuki was simply not as much as Dr. Crab's. The revision was certainly strange. Also, in order to achieve the perfect Hollywood romance, they decided to place more focus on the Chairman, leaving other characters such as Nobu almost in the background when he should have been a serious contender for Sayuri's future. In order to solidify the Chairman's presence, they even changed certain parts of the book (such as the introduction of the ""haven"" to Sayuri by the Chairman, not Nobu during WWII). Left by itself, it's probably okay, but after reading the book, it's a shame to see so much of its essence lost. Ignorance is truly bliss.I know i've made some very harsh comments towards the movie, but hopefully it hasn't put you of it. Most people has already made a sufficient amount of praises for it and most of them are accurate so i didn't bother to restate the obvious, and only concentrated on what i stood out to me. I still recommend you to go and see it, but if you want to truly enjoy it, it would be a good idea to watch it before you read the book! But nevertheless, no matter what order you choose, please do read the book. It gave me immense joy, and touched a place in my heart no movie could ever reach.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Some people even complained about the make-up geisha wore in the movie only proving they did little research on geisha My number one complaint was that so many little details were left out of the book. Although I'm positive that everyone knows the book was written by a westerner, everyone was so upset about all the authenticity of the film. The book was very good, yet the film left out some major details leaving the rest of my family (who did not read the book) even more confused about Japanese culture especially when it comes to geisha. The film only left a westerner to go on with the belief that geisha are in fact paid for ""their services"" which is said in the movie, and not explained well. Over all I felt the movie to be a downer after I had read the book and was waiting for the movie to be so great.Even at the beginning they leave out the first couple chapters so it starts with a very confusing beginning.

553,pirateclothes01,Read the book first- cheap thrills do not a movie make,3,6 January 2006,"This film was not unlike a gilded cage- a cheap frame of a script covered in the gold paint of Rob Marshall's glamor. If you like set design and costuming, you may like this movie in the theater. However, if it is plot and scripting that you prefer in your movies, wait for the DVD.I was fortunate enough to have read the book before seeing the film. If I had not, I probably would have been less interested in this movie. If you read the book first, you will enjoy all of the sections of the movie that stay true to the film.The plot was extremely disjointed- especially around the middle of the film, but I was awed by the set design. Of course, director Rob Marshall is famous for ""Chicago""- rendering fantasy worlds out of what would ordinarily be extremely uninteresting and actually rather boring close ups of cityscapes. He might have been the best thing to happen to this film.Sayuri in the book was barely likable as a character because of her bad choices and cruel actions, but Ziyi could do very little with her acting to encourage the viewers to like Sayuri more. Sayuri was so cold and annoying that I actually wished to see less of her in certain portions of the movie. Ziyi's acting is weak in comparison to strong acting from the other characters, to a noticeable degree.Rob Marshall's captivating powers of boring scenes slipped in one particular portion of the film, and it was very difficult for me and other moviegoers to stay awake. The movie literally flashes before your very eyes, so when this scene comes about it has the same effect on you as watching water boil after attending the circus. Fast editing and camera changes should not ever quickly transition to a slow scene- it's too devastating. The boringness of that scene was horrific.The costumes were beautiful, but I became quickly annoyed with all of the hair weaves in the movie. Only one character in the film should have had fake hair, but all of the rest of it was excessive and detracted from the costuming as a whole.I heard that a lot in this movie is grossly inaccurate- If you really want to know more about geisha, check out Mineko Iwasaki's ""Geisha, A Life"" (it's called ""Geisha of Gion"" in the UK) at any local bookstore. If you do see the movie or read the book, enjoy it as a narrative loosely based on reality, but not as fact itself.",Memoirs of a Geisha
554,bucky_waddle,Conflict of emotions,8,6 January 2006,"This movie, from the stand point of an American, was outstanding. I thought it was beautifully made. The dance sequences and the wardrobe were spectacular. Definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Emotional and breathtaking are two words I would use to describe this movie. Now, with that said, as an Asian, I can understand people's disdain for this movie. A movie about such a traditional aspect of Japanese culture should have include Japanese actresses as the main characters. Yes, the director should have done more research about the traditions of a Geisha and how Kimonos should be worn. Finally, the movie should have been done in Japanese and dubbed/subtitled in English. But, what you have to realize is that, as a director, you have to appeal to the masses. Unfortunately, the masses generally are English speaking people. I don't know of any Japanese actresses who can speak English fairly fluently. As for actresses like Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Zi Yi, I have seen them in other movies where they have had to speak English and have done it quite well. (Especially Michelle Yeoh...rent Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and go to the bonus features and there is a whole segment where she is doing an interview in pretty much perfect English) On the whole, I feel that both of these actresses, as well as the other actors/actresses who were in this movie, performed flawlessly. I don't know about most people, but I have a hard time distinguishing between a Japanese person, a Chinese person, a Korean person or any other Asian. And, as a Korean-American working in Japan, apparently Japanese people have a hard time making that distinction as well. I am consistently confused for a Japanese person. So, with that said, unless you can truly tell the distinction between Asians, I'd say you have no right making accusations about the actors/actresses in this movie. They played their roles very well and I thought they were perfectly cast for this movie. Political correctness can be a subject that is addressed in ANY movie, so why all the fuss about this one? If you can understand the main point of a movie by how well an actor/actress portrays their character, why try to start a big controversy about the movie? I say, take the movie for what it really is, a form of entertainment and escape from reality. That's what movies are really for anyway.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Unfortunately it was a year and I had to drive an hour to see it. It was worth the wait. Like one other reviewer mentioned, when reading the book I played it out in my head and when I saw the movie it was awesome. It was like everything I saw in my head was on screen almost exactly as I had imagined it. The acting was great, the actors and actress were very involved and rich with emotion. The movie line went nearly word for word with the book. It is a love story so my husband wasn't as into it but did enjoy it for its story and acting.

So Memoirs was the best fall-back option. Damned if I didn't turn out to like it. Some confusions along the way (accents didn't help -- would it have been better sub-titled?), but I agree that the sumptuous visuals didn't swamp the story line. Would have preferred a different ending, though. My wife, who has read the novel, says it's not a case of being ""true to the original,"" either. Any data on why the decision was made? The early scenes -- in Japanese, not subtitled, were at first annoying but on reflection made much sense -- the two children didn't have a clue, either. The primary child was indeed the true hit. But the witch-like senior geisha were wondrous, as were the performances (and I'm no fan of dance, Asian or otherwise. So, guys, don't resist if she suggests that as the flick of the week.

558,LinkMaster64,"""Historically accurate"" my butt",2,8 January 2006,"You've got to be kidding me.I'm having flashbacks of when that horrid little novel by Arthur Golden (which so many morons thought was actually someone's real story instead of the 100% work of fiction it truly is) began making its way through the popular/mass culture circles, some even dubbing it THE most substantial, in-depth look into one of Japan's most mysterious cultures. Following suit, the film is already garnering Oscar attention, hailing it as one of the greatest movies of the year. However, as you can probably guess from my score... I beg to differ.The creation, production, and public reception of this film doesn't surprise me in the least; America has recently (circa 2000) developed quite the hard-on for all things Asian. This in itself isn't a bad thing. But it becomes problematic when, instead of attempting to actively engage with a culture that's obviously foreign, both Golden and now the Rob Marshall instead give American's an already established ""ideal"" of Japan... further mystifying the country as the opposite-yet-idyllic backward little nation of Japan that America has come to know and love.I could prattle on about the ideological ramificaitons of mystifying Japan as the exotic-other, but this movie sucks in many other ways, and I wouldn't do this review justice if I didn't list them. First up should be the acting... and I'm not even going to complain about the use of Chinese actors in a Japanese film (thus avoiding the political tension between the two DIFFERENT nations). Seriously Marshall, just because they're Asian doesn't mean you can stick them in any Asian role out there... especially roles in which they must SPEAK Japanese. By the way, their Japanese was awful. Wait... actually, now that I think about it, the mixture of Japanese and English throughout the film (none of the Japanese is even subtitled... I guess Marshall thought naked Japanese would be powerful to us Americans) was confusing for my Japanese friends (whom sometimes weren't sure which language the actors were speaking in). And as much as I love heavily accented English, sometimes I couldn't understand it. This film would have been much better, and would have fit in the context better, if it were in all Japanese and subtitled into English. Conclusion: thanks Marshall, and I guess Golden for giving me such a beautiful picture of the world of Geishas... oh, wait... the world of the geisha sucked! And as much as we would like to believe it was all lights, flashy kimonos and beautiful girls, the majority of these girls' lives sucked, and that's just the bottom line. This sort of blind, ignorant praise of the lifestyle makes a mockery of the trials and tribulations of everything these women endured under a cruel, repressive social apparatus. Any intelligent viewer of this film that REALLY loves and appreciates something deeper in Japanese culture (and not this Hallmark, postcard-of-Mt.Fuji crap) will probably see this movie as a debacle as well.

561,nefertiki,Sadly lacking authenticity,3,12 January 2006,"Memoirs of a Geisha was much as I expected. Typical American made movie but with beautiful Gong Li in it. The first thing that struck me was all these Japanese people speaking English - in 1930's Japan no less. But then I knew beforehand it wasn't going to be authentically presented. It would have been easier to swallow with subtitles. The second thing that tweaked was the wretched soundtrack - no soft Japanese melodies here, rather, a very loud, frantic beat with lots of BOOM. For sure now I don't believe there is an American film made that doesn't have boom - it's an absolute requirement. If they can't have an explosion of some sort they'll create it with music but there has got to be boom. The acting was good, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh anyway but it was 2 hours and 20 minutes of a very weak story line. Maybe that explains the frantic soundtrack - the trying to create a feeling of excitement and tension because the story sure didn't do it. I found it rather obnoxious hearing a Japanese girl named Pumpkin. How very American. And of course it worked a common theme in American film - Cinderella becomes (geisha) princess. Culturally incorrect without a doubt. And of course geisha in fisticuffs - what else would you expect?! The costumes were beautiful, it was the best part of the film.

Just comments on how the film was put together.First thing that should be said is the story is fantastic; truly romantic and devastatingly sad at the same time and I enjoy that kind of schmaltzy film. The adaptation from the book to the screen conveyed the story well.However, although the story was clear, this was almost despite the dialogue; it was stilted, at times clumsy and quite frankly a mess.Stylistically the film was all over the place. There were exquisite scenes that were set up and filmed in ways that were sublime, and then another scene that had the potential for even MORE impact because of a dramatic change was presented as little better than an afternoon soap opera. The film jarred!! The music was also uncertain. There have been movies where there has been a combination of ""traditional"" music with more modern work but it has been handled in a more subtle way. It just did not work in this film. It was too obvious, too much of a clash, too little attention to how the music can make or ruin a scene.I wouldn't say ""don't see this film"" because most of the performances are good (allowing for the flawed dialogue and apart from the lead who was wooden) and the sets are wonderful and both definitely worth seeing.

564,peterhuenten,luxurious and something missing,8,24 January 2006,"In spite of being as complex as the novel the movie touches by the outstanding performance of Zhang Ziyi, Li Gong, Michelle Yeoh and a lavish deco. At last, yes, it is Hollywood and not really Japan but some admirers of an imagined ancient Japan will say that it shows what they have dreamed about Nippon (but what most likely wasn't true neither in the old days nor today). Memoirs of the Geisha generally is a movie mostly for the eyes but not for mind and heart. The psychology of the characters is painted quite poor and Rob Marshal wasn't able to bring them us really close. So we just look and enjoy those wonderful pictures of pre-war Kyoto but only when Zhang Ziyi radiantly performs our hearts beat faster. That Rob Marshal enganged three Chinese women for these Japanese parts brought a lot of trouble especially for Zhang in China but I can't endorse that because she is an artist and has to look for expierences, challenges and personal growing, not for nationalist provisos. The Chinese should be proud that their ""best ambassador"" was choosed for this part.",Memoirs of a Geisha
565,huangk,I am glad to know that some western audience also criticise this film,3,15 January 2006,"I admired Rob Marshall for Chicago, but Memoirs of Geisha turns out to be yet another failure of combing western and Asian arts. Overall, the scene is beautiful, but after restless emphasis on exoticism-oriented scenes some might just find himself fed up with them. The excessive cherry blossom was, frankly, overdone. It's probably the cultural difference of perception here: the ultimate beauty is not the showy type, as truly beautiful geisha would not be the over westernised pumpkin in the movie. Some other comments have rightly mentioned the biggest flaws. As a Taiwanese, I have no doubt the actress are great. An actor/actress can play any kind of role when he/she can look like it. Gong Li is great, but the power of emotions that she showed in this movie had not been translated into Japanese style. All I saw was a bittersweet and jealous Chinese WOMAN. Michlle Yeoh, one of my favourtie actress, did not even LOOK LIKE a Japanese. Some comment has mentioned the peculiar delicate, feminine characteristics of Japanese women, with which I can't agree more. These are so delicate that I assume not even all modern Japanese actresses are eligible for the roles in Geisha, let alone the two Chinese and one Malaysian actress who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know Japanese culture that much.Geisha is a good shot for arousing the curiosity of American audiences. But it would be an insult for the movie itself and for art alike if the movie wins the Oscar for best costume, best director or best picture.",Memoirs of a Geisha

Each frame of this movie is shot with an almost ""photographically beautiful"" quality. It exudes a number of frightfully underestimated themes; there are also many hidden jewels of representation and symbolism, a treasure in any film. However, it did at some points lag. Some portions of the story were drawn out too much, causing a loss of attention and drawing away from the concise meaning the movie leaves the watcher to interpret. Other than that little fallacy, the rest of this movie is absolutely wonderful. It is one that should be watched and thought of...honestly thought of. Most Excellent.",Memoirs of a Geisha
567,chickenheadeva84,The book is so much better,5,15 January 2006,"I watched this movie after reading the book and was really disappointed!! the book was really good. i found the movie hard to watch as the characters lacked depth and history. I think that the movie misses many key points and lacks to develop the characters in the way that the story was told originally. the movie was OK, but after reading the book i found the movie very disappointing and found that a lot of key terms and ideas were left out of the movie all together. Acting is good in the movie, and the actors chosen for the movie were just as i had imagined them. Maybe i am biased as i have read the book, but when watching the movie i felt that the story wasn't told properly and that many of the historical and key features of memois of a geisha were neglected, changing the story. Maybe if i hadnt read the book i would have enjoyed it more, but i also think i would have been confused and not known the true intended meaning of memois of a geisha",Memoirs of a Geisha
568,thetravisb,Ridiculously Underrated Film!,10,18 January 2006,"The film as a whole, start to finish is one that easily outdoes nearly all movies released this year. Having seen almost all movies released into theater this year, I can make such a judgment. For individuals to comment negatively on some minor, but not at all of a negatively impacting nature, problems with speech aspects as well as of the fact that in several cases Chinese actors took on the role of Japanese actors is entirely and utterly disappointing. Would a purely American-Caucasian person playing the role of an Irishman be ostracized? That is almost entirely doubtful. Not only is it doubtful, but such a thing happens ridiculously often in large amounts of American film. Such is the case with Geisha. Story wise, this was written by a man studying such a subject intently alongside a prior, quite successful geisha named Mineko. While almost all films with direct translation to American cinema, Asian themed movies do on some terms lose portrayal their illustrious customs due to a simple not understanding of the American culture as a whole. When watching this movie watch it simply based on what it is, not what it isn't.",Memoirs of a Geisha
569,kirabeauty,A lyrical interpretation of the 'floating world',9,19 January 2006,"This film is very faithful to Golden's book. It is not a Japanese film. It is not from a realistic perspective. Marshall allows Golden's appreciation of the beauty and artistry of the Geisha culture to wash over the viewer like soft rain. You will be moved, you will be visually stimulated and you will marvel at the talents of these stupendous performances by actors known to hundreds of millions of people - they just don't happen to be known to most westerners. You will feel a longing to see cherry blossoms, to drink sake and to visit the old traditional areas of Japan like Hida-Takayama and the Japan sea coast. This film should do a lot to promote both Japan and Asian film in general. I hope so. The stand-out performances are Gong Li as the femme fatale Hatsumomo, Ken Watanabe as The stoic-and-so-Japanese Chairman and Yakusho Koji for his measured performance as Nobu-san. I loved Ziyi Zhang but thought that both Golden in the novel and Marshall in the film got the eye colour all wrong. It was a little distracting due to the fact that it looked so odd - I never really reconciled the gray eye thing in the book though so it could be my problem! Regardless, a beautiful film. Standout scene is Sayuri's dance in a stylised Kabuki delivery that brought back memories of the Kabuki-Za Theatre in Tokyo.There is great attention to detail and authenticity in sensorially rich locations, lush kimono silks and smooth wrists of the young maiko! There is almost a tactile quality to this film. Bathe yourself in its beauty.",Memoirs of a Geisha
570,matadavie,My thoughts on memoirs of a geisha,9,22 January 2006,"I really enjoyed this movie, I have had the book since it first came out and have probably read it close to a hundred times, so I had a very strong idea in my mind about the characters would look etc, I must say i was a bit sad that they cut so much of the first part of the book out, however i do understand that it was a time thing and they probably felt it wasn't relevant to the plot line. I lived in Japan for over a year and I must admit i was a bit dismayed when they first cast the Chinese actresses in the lead role, however I thought they did a wonderful job, Zhang Ziyi was fantastic as Sayuri and brought her to life just as i imagined her to be, Michelle Yeoh was so right as Mameha, and Gong Li was just the right amount of nastiness as Hatsumomo, and as usual after watching Ken Wantanabe I think he's a great actor and can happily day dream about him, could they have made a better choice for the Chairman, I think not. I also thought that Koji Yakusho was perfect as Nobu. The costumes were so beautiful and old style Kyoto was portrayed just as I'm sure it would have been. There have been lots of negative comments made of the movie, but people need to remember that a movie is just a bit of an escape from the real world for a few hours, not a life changing event. I give a big thumbs up to all involved in this movie and would recommend it to all who have read the book and anyone who is interested in japan and it's culture, because a lot of the things that were portrayed in this movie still have a real relevance in Japans society today.",Memoirs of a Geisha
571,piratesandcigarettes,it just didn't work,5,4 February 2006,"utterly disappointing. I was looking forward to watching the movie as I was a fan of the book.The book wasn't extraordinary but it had a certain element to it which made it unique and enjoyable. The fact that the actors were Chinese didn't bother me, what did bother me was their awful accents, why not just make the movie in Japanese? why make the actors speak in English? It would of been much more believable if they hadn't spoken in English. Obviously they had to cast the more famous Asian actors for budget reasons. The movie had stunning images, The Mise-en-scene was definitely one of the higher assets.The movie was beautiful to watch but I was getting bored. I did not care for the characters as much as I had when reading the book. All in all i feel that there was some good work there but the movie just didn't have a balance.It didn't work",Memoirs of a Geisha
572,kategreenfield,A pleasant surprise,8,24 January 2006,"After reading reviews and loving the book, I was quite sceptical, however, I was pleasantly surprised. OK, so they should really have used Japanese actresses playing key roles, and it would have had more depth and feeling if it had been done in the native language, but... it was good. Its didn't lose the cultural identity and meaning as some have suggested, in fact I thought it was a beautifully artistic film, in the same spirit as the book.I love far eastern literature, because I enjoy learning about the culture and history of countries so different to the west. I feel that this film shows the depth of culture in Japan, but at the same time enables you to identify with the feelings and emotions felt by human spirits all over the world. If you want more grit and understanding then perhaps the book is for you, but for a truly beautiful piece of film which is in essence a love story and a story of courage and hope, then I don't think you can go too far wrong!",Memoirs of a Geisha
573,pate-8,The Memoirs of a Geisha - A thing to think of.,10,24 January 2006,"It's not a movie you can just ignore. The plot itself makes this movie a great thing. From a dramatic beginning, to an exciting and touching part in the middle to an awesome ending ( where no one thought of ). I think for myself that this movie is just another masterpiece in history. But this is not the work of just one man. It's the entire film crew, the staff , the actors and all the people who worked on/for this movie who made this movie this impressive.Often you see movies, based on novels which really cant grab the plot and just make another bad-made movie. It's quite the opposite here. When you read the novel, written by Arthur Golden, watch the movie, produced by Steven Spielberg you really can feel the novel, the plot of it.I just can recommend this movie for all people who cant get enough of dramas and romance.",Memoirs of a Geisha
574,HonuaGal,Visually exquisite!,9,27 January 2006,"Having lived in Japan, I found the movie to be beautifully shot. If for no other reason, go to see the culture and beauty of Japan in the early 20th century. The cherry blossoms in spring to the cold winter snow... Each scene was like a picture. Best of all, the movie provides a glimpse into the true nature of Geisha. The post-war feeling of Japan under the influence of the American military was also accurately portrayed. I may have given it a 10 except for the gratuitous, tacky ending. The final scene should have been Sayuri on the mountain top. I am very disappointed with the contrived conclusion.",Memoirs of a Geisha

I absolutely loved it; it was great to go to the cinema and see something different to the norm. Every film seems to be the same these days, and most of them based in Western culture, so i really did enjoy this one. I know there has been a bit of a fuss about the fact that a Chinese actress was chosen to play the part of a Japenese girl. I don't know the reasons behind this, so wont say too much, but it did occur to me that English, American, German etc.. actors and actresses play one another a lot of the time. So perhaps people are making a fuss out of nothing.",Memoirs of a Geisha

It was a little long and the movies got lost in the end. The ending as far as I am concerned ruined all the beauty in the movie. I read the book a long time ago and enjoyed it. I saw the movie and enjoyed it , but the part with the ""former Geisha"" who betrayed the star Geisha, stated ""all American soldiers are Bastards"". This was not in the book making that statement, I feel it was an agenda to vilify our servicemen. THEY ARE NOT BASTARDS and served nobly in Japan to give all Americans to make stupefied statement.",Memoirs of a Geisha
577,hirokon-1,Quite enjoyed it!,7,29 January 2006,"Having read the book a few years ago and being a bit of a Ziyi fan I just had to see the film. And I wasn't disappointed. I think Rob Marshall did a wonderful job creating a visually beautiful fairytale with a very strong cast. The film was very faithful to the book and even kept the ending I didn't like. I thought the Chinese actresses were quite believable as Japanese and gorgeous, and although, as some reviewers have said, the actors' broken English could not be understood at times, their acting made up for it. It was certainly an entertaining film--a story of a determined young girl (played by a very convincing child actor!) blossoming into a beautiful geisha despite many difficulties. I am actually quite surprised by the number of people (including a lot of Japanese) who criticise the film for its inaccuracy on the portrayal of Geisha culture. Okay, so the film is not accurate, but Geisha culture is as much a mystery to the Japanese as it is to the Western world. Very little is known about what happened inside the closed world of Gion where the story takes place. Only some of the privileged and respected men were allowed into the teahouses (where geisha entertained men) and it was forbidden for geishas to talk about what went on in the teahouses (Thank god someone broke the rules or we would have never known their story!!). Actually some of my relatives used to run teahouses in Gion, however I know very little because sadly they went out of business after the War like other teahouses in the film or started what Mameha (played by the very gracious Michelle Yeoh) did 'renting rooms'. The fact is Gion has dwindled into such a sad state these days. Many teahouses, except for the very best, have become merely overpriced souvenir shops and hotels; and real geishas are outnumbered by tourist 'instant geishas' who have no elegance at all (who are comparable to some of the minor geishas in the film).Anyway, it is unjust to point out what the film did wrong just because it is a Hollywood film. It would be very difficult for a Japanese film maker to recreate an accurate picture of Gion on film anyway. In that sense, I think it was a benefit to the film in not having a Japanese director or Japanese actresses. It liberated it from the burden of portraying Geishas accurately and created a more fairytale-like story. Not to discredit the filmmakers--- they obviously made a lot of effort in making some of the details very believable. I was quite impressed with the quality of the set. I think it captured the darkness and light of Gion very well. The narrow backstreets and the gloomy okiya (where geishas lived) were believable--my relative's teahouse where they still live is indeed very dark and suffocating by day, but at night the district lights up prettily. Another detail not to be missed: the sumo scene. They actually have a very famous retired sumo wrestler performing!Anyway, overall I think it's very much worth seeing so don't be put-off by the negative reviews!",Memoirs of a Geisha

I don't know a lot about Japan and Asia and all that but it is not required at all. The story is amazing and I don't think there is anything about I would change. After I saw it I instantly felt I needed to tell my friends about this awesome movie. If you are not really into movies with a lot of meaning you might not enjoy it.

580,guyjincj,Disappointment of the year,2,2 February 2006,"2 stars and just because the visuals are beautiful, other than that, I don't think I have too many positive comments about the movie.I live in Japan and one of the things that make me want to move here was the book, Memoirs of a Geisha. I had the mental image of this ""mystical"" land, beautiful landscape and interesting people. I wasn't wrong. I had been anxiously waiting for the movie and was very excited when I heard they were finally releasing it..and then came the reviews. I so badly wanted the poor reviews to be untrue,after all, a lot of the movies I love, haven't had terribly good reviews, there was hope.I was extremely disappointed with the opening scene of the movie and my disappointment lasted throughout the movie. The characters lack the substance that they had in the book. The adaptation is weak and for someone who hasn't read the book, a lot of key events may go unnoticed or not have the significance they actually had.Does the movie tell us why Chiyo-chan was sold to the okiya? Do we actually get to see Hatsumomo in all her splendour and wickedness? Do we get to see Sayuri's transition into a geisha? No, we don't. Well we see is a very watered down version of the people and events. Sayuri's dance at the Cherry Blossom festival,though visually stunning, lacked the passion that we could feel in the book.The acting is rather weak and superficial, I like Zhiyi Zang or however you spell her name and Michelle Yeoh, but in this movie they seemed to be taken out of a B-Chinese flick. Even Ken Watanabe's acting seemed superficial. The only one I thought did a great job was the actress who played Pumpkin. Do I recommend it? For it's entertainment and visual value,sure..for being accurate and deep? DEfinitely NOT, stick to the book.",Memoirs of a Geisha

All the characters in this film, are completely believable and I found it easy to sympathise with them all.As I sat and watched the film, I was both enthralled and engrossed as I sat and ate an entire large popcorn on my own without even noticing!As I looked around the room, there was people of all ages and both sexes who, like me, were totally engrossed in the film. Although the film is almost 2 1/2 hours long, I found that there was no part of the film in which you would feel that it was dragging, in fact I was amazed to find that I had been sitting for that long.All in all, I would recommend anyone to see this film.",Memoirs of a Geisha

There were a lot of pieces missing in the movie from the book but taking into account the amount of time and pages you have in a script compared to the amount of pages in a novel it really exceeded my expectations. The scenery was just as i had imagined if not much more. The music played an important part in this movie along with the narrative voice which added a lot of pieces from the book into the movie. Last but not least the idea of giving her blue eyes was probably the best touch. It made her a very unique Geisha and probably unforgettable.thank you,Memoirs of a Geisha

The characters were well acted out even though the 3 female leads were not Japanese. I must admit I was surprised to read some pretty negative reviews of the film, unjustified I might add. I do agree that not everyone would enjoy such a film because like wine it is an acquired taste. Throughout the film there is that element of a Hollywood style over the top set finish, it must be pointed out that the beauty and grace of the leads could outshine any set.

I wanted to see if they had stuck to the book at all and i think they have done very well with keeping to the book.

585,angelic-perfection,This story is beautiful,10,9 May 2006,"I thought the movie was wonderful. The cast has Chinese in it, true, but what's the point? I think most of the Japanese angry about this is because of the war 60 years ago. Get over it, we're (the Chinese) is still bitter about the fact your government won't say sorry. I have no trouble if the story was a Chinese movie and Japanese people filmed in it, in fact a lot of famous Chinese films and TV series are in fact acted with the Japanese, you don't see me crying and screaming over it. D: This story was sad, beautiful, wonderful, and close to the book. Have you read it? It's mesmerizing and every step of the way Sayuri played the part of the girl with too much burden. She speaks up for those children who are sold every day to the highest bidders, weather her intention or not. Her soul is bound in a world where people just can't except a Geisha to have feelings.Just to tell you, Geisha is NOT about sex! OK? Got that? Some of the lower Geisha sell themselves, but that is because they cannot make a living, and their Okiya (Read the book) is demanding pay. However, an honorable Geisha will not sell herself most of the time, and the very most famous (Like Mameha) will only have one or two Danna in their live time (Directly taken out of the Book). This means no over-excessive sex, we ARE talking about one of the most famous Geishas of Japan: Sayuri. Who is a real character who lived a real crisis.I think for those of you who says the story is too 'Boring', you should see and feel the culture a little more. This story looks on to so many things and I remembered when I first watched it, beautiful.Of course, it doesn't mean you can't not like it, I hated Holes and people are still killing me about it; you just don't like it. But this story is not stupid, weird, idiotic, or worst, 'Boring'. Like the last person who commented, this is not an American story. This is not some dramatic story about a girl who has to cat fight a rival for her boyfriend, this is not Harry Potter, this is not anything. Like the movie says, Geisha is another world and people who speaks bad about it should first understand it.This movie is like Japanese tea: You may drink it, you may sputter if you do not know it, but for those that keep an open mind they will keep trying until eventually, they will welcome the sweet aroma, though a bit bitter.We live for the familiar, don't criticize things you can't understand.(Just to put another note, I feel absolutely incriminated when people say how Geisha is supposed to be about sex! I'm a 1/ 8 Japanese myself and my great great grandmother's sister was a Geisha, not a famous one to say, but still one. In her life is had only ONE DANNA. That's surprising for such an little known Geisha.)",Memoirs of a Geisha
586,pariss61,real,9,26 February 2006,"its a real movie with all the every day difficulties of a woman in 1940 in Japan. Also, this movie shows how many cultures,like this great culture of Japan, have changed since they met ""malboro"". A geisha walking with a jack Daniels in her fingers was the ultimate ""politistic invention"". An excellent depict of reality. To be a woman pure its a gift its not something which you can buy!! Does anybody knows if a kimono or a jean is more powerful?Beautiful clothes, balanced scenario and finally real story not imagination. Finally how difficult was to live alone a woman without the protection of a man in a such aggressive environment? I could say also that this movie shows the respect of those people for each other. Another society discipline but also strange. How can be something so beautiful and powerful like a geisha to want to be an ""entertaining tool"" for any men who can pay?Maybe this legend of a geisha was something so ""elit"" and special but after became something which can have everyone. I believe the scenario was very simple and was based on her life. If you haven't found this story your scenario would be null.If you want to see this movie remember to get ready to enter to a magic and dreaming world!!!Geisha World.",Memoirs of a Geisha
587,curtiselyles,Japan's Cinderella,9,8 December 2018,"Memoirs of a Geisha is a Cinderella adaptation that is portrayed with honor and respect to the culture. The film was a very in-depth view of courage, sacrifice and will. I did not anticipate it being an underdog story. I would not categorize the film as one where Chiyo (portrayed by Suzuka Ohgo) was looking for destiny, just one where her she needed to motivate herself and adapt to survive.Chiyo is a child that experiences losing a mother, being bartered with her sister, by a desperate father, in hopes of securing a future. The risk taken wards Chiyo into service to house of Geisha's, where her sister did not quite measure up and was subjected to a life of prostitution. Chiyo was tasked with growing up fast. She would find out that no one would consider her best interest, leaving her rather destitute through the early portion of the film. She would be used and abused, desperation and forsaken are surely her internal emotions. Her early choice ins to assimilate and comply. Her friend and mentor, so to speak is, Pumpkin (young pumpkin portrayed by Zoe Weizenbaum and the older Pumpkin portrayed by Yuki Kudo). Pumpkin showed Chiyo the ropes in an effort to find some normalcy. This relationship would ultimately change from friendship to rivalry. Chiyo's main antagonist is Hatsumomo (portrayed by Gong Li), a Geisha whom manipulates, lies and subjects young Chiyo to emotional, mental and physical harm.Chiyo's life starts to look up when she receives a random act of kindness. Sitting on a small bridge looking over the creek, the Chairman (portrayed by Ken Watanabe) notices her crying. After talking with him shortly and his effort to cheer her up, she finds some comfort and motivation to conform. Call it a childhood infatuation, she takes a liking to him and seeks to become his Geisha. As the film transitions to her teen age years, a wager of sorts is made in the Okiya house between Mother (portrayed by Kaori Momoi) and Mameha (portrayed Michelle Yeoh). Mameha takes young Chiyo under her wing to guide her to becoming the most popular Geisha.The film progresses from Chiyo being transformed to Sayuri (Ziyi Zhang) is a documentation of her learning the way. She is poised to be respectful, personable and professional in her interactions. She notably achieves her goal, only to be over shadowed by war coming to Japan. She again is shown kindness and protection by the Chairman, ushering her away to save her life.
The life of a Geisha was one of discipline, an art. After the war concludes, the definition of Geisha was not the same. Instead of an artful persona, the word is re-appropriated as a prostitute. The story, the world, becomes ever so small. Her popularity is utilized to achieve a goal that would help ensure Japan's future. At the same time her efforts are to secure love.Memoirs of a Geisha provides a structured view of culture. It illustrated the ability to overcome. My original definition of Geisha was more of prostitution. The Geisha was more of a companion, an escort so to speak. Chiyo was able to live up to her mother's description of her and live up to her crystal blue water-like eyes. Her character was one of strength, fortitude and honest. The director was able to utilize excellent camera work, vivid color and execute a great story.",Memoirs of a Geisha

The life of a geisha is one that opens up a pandoras box of emotions, traditions, values and beliefs. The pain and shame associated in the Western World with the Geisha stereotype, would contrast sharply with the glamour and beauty of the world of a geisha. A world that served men, and their pleasure. A world that called for perfection in a woman...for flawlessness. So when I sat down, and the narrators voice began...My heart would not stop beating for in some way it felt like exploring a bit of a world that I did not know, and was not privy to in the manner in which it would not be revealed to me. And what a revelation it was. A powerful and colourful portrayal of the battle for survival that the life of a geisha is...and the perfection that is demanded for one to have peace and comfort. Though I considered the movie to be excellent, and deeply moving...and suspenseful...it did not meet the epic value of Joy Luck Club. I found its value instead to be of good cultural value, and great humanist value...being a powerful story of faith and love.A must see...and must own. To fully understand the Cultural revelations in the movie...which were oftentimes overshadowed by the romance in it...such was it great...I would strongly recommend that all buy the book. Though it is not itself an epic book...it will enlighten the areas that were left dark in the movie..even if so beautifully shadowed to illuminate the light of Sayuri's love.",Memoirs of a Geisha
590,atticuslovetoread,Forget the movie. Read the book.,4,7 March 2006,"I love Memoirs of a Geisha so I read the book twice; it is one of the best book I've read last year. I was looking forward to the movie and was afraid that reading the book would ruin the viewing pleasure of the movie. I wasn't expecting the movie to be that bad. Some of the best part of the book was omitted from the movie and the characters were weak with Hatsumomo (Li Gong)been the worst. If I haven't read the book, this movie would be a little confusing and inexplicable. The Plot Outline of the movie states ""Nitta Sayuri reveals how she transcended her fishing..."" Did anyone see how or when Sayuri became Nitta Sayuri? Forget the movie and read the book.",Memoirs of a Geisha
591,kagome_2006,I loved it..but of course the book was better...now my favorite book and my favorite movie,10,14 March 2006,I loved it..but of course the book was better...now my favorite book and my favorite movie....Zhang Ziyi was beautiful...the ending should not have been changed...but still good...I loved the costumes....and the scenery wow so beautiful...I really need to go to Japan...I think the depictions of most of the characters...(with the exception of Nobu) were really really close to the book...it was amazing with Hatsumomo and mother...the geisha school and the training with Mameha was exactly how I thought it was...I loved the stage dance that Ziyi's character Sayuri did...it was beautiful...I had no absolute idea in my mind how it was when I read the book so actually seeing it justified what it looked like...over all I can't wait for this movie to come out...,Memoirs of a Geisha
592,chances-dad,Why has this been trashed so often?,9,24 March 2006,"I don't understand why this movie got such lousy reviews. I saw it once, went out and got the book, read it, and went and saw the movie again. And I'll get the DVD next week when it's released. The local reviewer said it was a ""long, frigid adaptation...sunk by a meandering story and clinical feel"". What exactly is a clinical feel? They did a great job of turning the book into the movie. Frigid? How could anyone think that with all of the emotions displayed in the movie. And why were both screenings that I went to sold out, while still at a first run theater? It's definitely one of the best movies I've seen in the past year, and among the best I've seen in a long time. The story line was long and covered quite a bit of territory, but I'd hardly call it 'meandering'. Maybe the reviewer just couldn't follow the story line. Of course, to him, a movie has to be an ""EVENT"" or it isn't worth his time. Memoirs has it all...good story, great production values, gorgeous women in unbelievable costumes, plenty of information about 30's Japan and their culture, funny moments, lots of emotion and best of all, when you least expect it, an ending that doesn't send you out of the theater shaking your head and saying ""What were they thinking?"" It's too bad it was so overlooked and deserves much more positive recognition than it's gotten.",Memoirs of a Geisha
593,funbun-1,very NICE film!!!,1,26 March 2006,"UTTERLY, COMPLETELY, TOTALLY UNSPEAKABLE FILM!!!! SERIOUS OFFENCE to Japanese culture and Japanese people. How dare they used Chinese actors to make the film about Geisha!? It has been continuing for many years and a sensitive field of the Japanese Culture. What would Ziyi Zhang learn in 6 months when the Geisha culture has history of more than 500years!? Don't even start about ""Who would care about the ethnicity?"" Because some people DO. Imagine what would happen if you make Chinese culture film with Japanese actors?That can trigger a war!!!Beautiful film? Yes. Good act? Yes. BUT make a different film and leave Japanese culture alone!!!! Oh, and you know what? Japanese don't have BLUE EYES!!! Seems like they are dissatisfactory with black eyes!!! Like they are so dominant that they can't even stand to use black eyes on the poster!!! What a DISCRIMINATION!!! This film was nothing but a MISTAKE!!!",Memoirs of a Geisha
594,amillett06,Excellent movie but had some unneeded changes from the book,8,29 March 2006,"Memoirs of a geisha was a great, great book. I was captivated and found myself excited for that next moment in which I could continue reading. I rented the movie the day it came out (yesterday) with anticipation of an equally magnificent movie.All-in-all, the movie was just about what I expected. The cinematography was superb - the best I have ever seen in a movie. It was dramatic, passionate, and extremely captivating. My only disappointments came from the hurried half-explanations of some of the events in Chiyo/Sayuri's life, (its hard to pack a 400+ page book into a movie) and the fact that some of the original aspects of the book were changed completely. Not to be nitpicky, but Nobu had only 1 arm in the book, Sayuri was to seduce the Minister of Finances not the Commander of American forces, and others. Sayuri also never met with Mameha's friend the painter, which was a key part of the story.Despite this, the movie was done in such a way that I enjoyed it, even though some details were not exactly as in the book. I know I will watch this movie many times over, and enjoy it each time. I suggest that you read the book first, then watch the movie if you haven't already. Even if you have seen the movie, read the book. It will bring you a better understanding of the story and you will appreciate it much more.",Memoirs of a Geisha
