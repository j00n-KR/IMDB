0,TheLittleSongbird,"Disappointing, considering the director and cast",4,16 September 2011,"I do remember seeing this film on TV once, and other than the visuals, good music and two or three decent performances I didn't think much of it. I was considering a re-watch, but was advised by a very reliable and trust-worthy pen pal not to. But as I have said many times about other movies, I was curious. As I do love the director and think highly of the cast, I did finally give it a chance. And my initial reaction sadly hasn't changed.I will give credit where it's due. It is an artistically tasteful film, with wonderful cinematography and editing and the effects are great. The score is also memorable and more importantly fits with the movies' tone. And I found Eric Bana very charismatic in his role, and I enjoyed Sam Elliot too.Jennifer Connelly does okay with what she's got, but I didn't find her character as interesting, in fact she came across as unnecessary and vapid at points. Nick Nolte I like, but he overplays here and it doesn't help that his whole story was on the misconceived side and in a way feels like a different movie altogether.I mostly liked Lee's direction too. I am very fond of Lee, he is a great director and has a very distinctive style which comes through loud and clear with Hulk, and I love his films. Brokeback Mountain and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon are two of my favourite movies of all time, I love the Ice Storm and Sense and Sensibility is one of the better period drama films I've seen.Although he does do a decent enough job here despite a tendency to let his style get in the way of telling the story and making us connect to the characters(the only time I have felt this about him), sometimes even impressive, there are reasons why this is my least favourite film so far of his.First off, I wasn't all that impressed by the action. Not that it was badly edited or choreographed, in fact these scenes are done with efficient style and the choreography doesn't look all that clumsy. It is all to do with tone, most of the action sequences here don't fit all that well with the feel of the overall film, the fight with the poodles is a prime example, which felt rather silly compared to the film's intensity.The script has some brooding lines from Bana and Elliot, but some lines feel stilted or delivered in a bland fashion. Which brings me to the story, I loved the idea and had no problem with it. It also started off great. Its problems was that the more over-complicated it got, the more leaden the pace got too and the more things were left with little to no explanation, leading to one of the weakest and most disappointing endings I've seen for any comic book movie. Ridiculous is a more ideal way to describe it.All in all, considering the director, concept and cast involved, Hulk was very disappointing and didn't live to hopeful expectations of improvement on re-watch. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Hulk
1,Leofwine_draca,Slow-moving character drama lacks the vigour and fun of a superhero movie,4,4 August 2016,"A mildly agreeable comic book adaptation, which fits a lot of material into its running time. Sadly the film isn't perfect by a long shot, but it does contain some material which helps to make the slower parts easier to digest. Director Ang Lee once again creates a beautiful-looking film (the emphasis on 'comic book' style with lots of split screens, dissolves, and colourful cartoonish editing) but one wonders if he could have perhaps inserted a little (or any) humour into his movie – the straight-face antics are pretty gruelling, so we end up laughing at moments that aren't supposed to be funny instead.The back story is engagingly written, but full of cliché – like characters remarking to Bruce Banner as a child that he has ""something inside him"" etc. To be honest it also goes on a long while, making audience members fidget in their seats for the first appearance of the Hulk. He doesn't disappoint – the CGI effects are far better than you would imagine (compare top-end CGI like this to the horrendous rubbish seen in THE MUMMY and its sequels), the Hulk looks very cool indeed, but I'm thinking they must have had some problems seeing as two major Hulk scenes take place in the dark, so that you can't really see what's going on.The initial trashing-of-the-lab is a great crowd pleaser, but for me the highlight of the film is the Hulk's extended rampage towards the end of the flick – including a (very) brief attack on a major city. Scenes of the Hulk battling tanks and helicopters make for fantastic viewing, although I was a bit annoyed with the way they had nobody get killed as a result – scenes showing the guy climbing out of a totally wrecked tank are ludicrous, as is the way no helicopters ever explode when crashing down into the ground. The rest of the non-Hulk scenes are fine but a little predictable to those of us who have seen such comic-book antics before (SPIDER-MAN etc.), breaking little new ground.Eric Bana is okay as the leading man, but a little wooden. I would have preferred a more established actor in the role. If Bana is just okay, then Jennifer Connelly is hopeless, really bad here. She seems to have forgotten how to act in the interim since her glory days in the '80s. Nick Nolte, in comparison, overacts totally, so he's quite a commanding presence with his gruff voice and straggly hair. I love the scene where he exposes himself to radiation and melts into the ground, a great use of special effects because they are so sparing. Keen-eyed viewers may spot Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee in brief cameos. My biggest complaint is with the ending, a sudden battle with the Hulk and his superhuman dad, which takes happens so quickly, and in the dark, so you're left wondering what the heck is going on.",Hulk
2,SnoopyStyle,Interesting attempt,6,26 April 2014,"Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a brilliant scientist working with his girlfriend Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) on nanomeds and gamma radiation to cure physical ailments. A lab accident causes high exposure of gamma radiation and releases the hulk within him. His father David (Nick Nolte) had experimented on himself and transferred some changes within Bruce. When Bruce was 4, an incident which he can't remember caused Betty's father Gen Ross (Sam Elliott) to lock up David Banner. Now David is back just in time to see the change in Bruce release by the gamma radiation.Director Ang Lee definitely put his own mark on this comic book movie. It's probably not what the fans or Marvel was looking for. This is a much more a Greek tragedy than a popcorn summer action flick. While it's the not the best choice, it does make it an uniquely interesting comic book movie.The acting from Eric Bana is a little too bland. He's not really a favorite of mine. On the other hand, Jennifer Connelly is superb. She is the heart and soul of this movie. Nick Nolte shows that he can play crazy well. He definitely goes overboard but I sorta like it. Sam Elliott tries a little too hard. He should be able to play this part without trying. He doesn't need to yell and scream.Then there is all the split screen and other visual tricks. Ang Lee is pulling inspiration from the comic books. However he may be too literal and more importantly overused this style. Luckily, it does make it more visually interesting when the story moves at a slower pace. There is something outside the normal comic book movie going on here. It is fascinating. It doesn't work that well. But it's good enough for me to recommend. It's worthwhile to check out at least once.",Hulk
3,claudio_carvalho,"The Story Could Be Shorter and With More Action Scenes, But Entertains",6,11 November 2003,"Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a geneticist working with her colleague and former lover Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) in a laboratory in a military base. One day, he is exposed to gamma rays when protecting a colleague from an accidental operation of Betty. This exposure releases Hulk, a green monster. Bruce becomes aware that he is the fruit of a genetic experience of his crazy father, David Banner (Nick Nolte). The approach of Ang Lee to the story of Hulk is not bad. However, the screenplay could be shorter and less dramatic, since fans of Hulk certainly like action movies. I myself do not like the technique of using of split screen, maybe with the intention to be similar to a cartoon. In my opinion, the graphics of Hulk make him look like Shrek. Maybe, the use of a very strong actor would be better than the virtual character. But anyway, it entertains, and it is very above the average of similar movies. However, Daredevil, Spiderman and X-Men are better and better. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Hulk""",Hulk
4,kosmasp,Bulked up,4,3 April 2007,"The last paragraphs, will be the ones with the spoilers! I'll indicate them! As you might have read in my other reviews, I'm quite fond of Mr. Ang Lee. Overall I like his style and his movies. That is with one big exception! This exception is this movie right here!It is not the CGI, that makes me turn away from this movie. It might not be the best CGI ever in a movie, but that doesn't make the movie bad for me! (I won't even go into the discussion about his trousers or the size of them) ... No the reason I don't like this movie is ...Spoilers ahead for the rest of the text: The dramatic part of it. Not that I don't agree with his intentions, to make a troubled Hulk. But it doesn't work! All the relationships are troubled, but they don't convince at any point. So Betty Ross still loves Hulk? I don't feel/see it on screen!While I'm talking about her: Why would she trust the man, that tried to kill her (aka Hulks/Bruce's father)? It's like one minute he tries to kill her, the next she's like ""Oh you poor thing, you only want to see your son ..."" ... VERY convincing ... NOT!Another good (bad) point is, who in gods name would think it's a good idea to bring Bruce Banner (Hulk) and his father together?!? Although I can suspend my disbelief for that point, because you've got to have this confrontation, it still seems out of place with a movie that tries not to use those ""tricks"", instead opting for the real solutions/ways ... but not in this case it doesn't!To summarize: I'm not criticizing the movie for it's action scenes (CGI or not) or the fact that it tries to push the drama. It is that it is badly executed, which can be seen in the relationships between the characters ... They are written down in the script, but at no point any of them is convincing. Especially Betty and Bruce. There is nothing there. And that's not nearly enough for the climax, where you have to believe they genuinely love each other! I wanted to like that movie, especially after all the bashing it got, but I can't just because of that ...",Hulk
5,classicsoncall,"""We're gonna have to watch that temper of yours.""",7,26 May 2012,"I saw ""Hulk"" in the theater when it first came out, but while watching it again today I could only remember a handful of scenes. There was Hulk (Eric Bana) grabbing the army tank's gun turret and whipping it across the desert, and that unusual final scene with the bearded Bana in the middle of a Central American jungle. What this suggests is that I might have fallen asleep for a good chunk of the movie the first time around. Having stayed completely awake for this latest viewing, I'm not convinced it was the best use of my time.One of the cool things about horror movies from the Thirties and Forties was their great use of pseudo-scientific jargon for some mad scientist's evil experiments in creating new life, transmigrating souls or personalities, or developing some wild and crazy mutant life form. That's why I got a kick out of some of the terminology used here relative to human regeneration, genetic alteration and unstable DNA. I didn't read the Hulk comic books regularly as a kid, but from what I recall, the general concept of Bruce Banner's exposure to gamma radiation is maintained here in broad form. Apparently Bruce's Dad and the experimentation on his own kid was thrown in for good measure, lending a horrific twisted component to the story.My favorite, though very brief segment of the picture was that quickie scene of Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee doing his trusted cameo gig, this time in company with the TV Hulk's Lou Ferrigno. I have no doubt that if he were still alive, Bill Bixby would also have had a moment on screen as well. It's those kind of tributes that comic book and film fans like myself really appreciate.As for the principal players, I really couldn't warm up to Eric Bana's casting as the title character. He seemed conflicted enough for the monster's tortured soul, but he just didn't seem to convey a charisma on screen. Jennifer Connely appeared competent enough in what seemed to be a thankless role, and any time Sam Elliott appeared on screen as her father General Ross, I kept wondering when he got his promotion from Major in the comic series. It might have happened, but it took me by surprise here. Then of course there's Nick Nolte, looking like he just stepped onto the set following that classic mug shot from a decade ago, with time in between to grow an over-sized beard. What a mess, and completely in synch with the character he was meant to portray.",Hulk
6,lee_eisenberg,From several aspects...,5,11 March 2006,"On the one hand, ""Hulk"" is a big, loud mess; but on the other hand, it's somewhat interesting due to Bruce Banner's (Eric Bana) inner conflicts: he doesn't really like becoming the big green guy, but at the same time likes the feeling of power. The most eye-opening aspect, at least for me, was how they did the scenes like in graphic novels.I guess the thing that's most surprising for us is who all worked on this movie: there's the director of ""Brokeback Mountain"", the star of ""Munich"", the woman from ""A Beautiful Mind"", plus Sam Elliott and Nick Nolte. Considering that the material involves a lot of thrashing and destruction, I guess that everyone's doing as good a job as possible. One of my friends remembers when they closed the Golden Gate Bridge to film a scene. All in all, not the greatest superhero movie, but not awful.",Hulk
7,jboothmillard,Hulk,4,24 June 2008,"It was predictable to see the first live action film starring the big green monster on TV, because of the release of the new Edward Norton one at the cinemas. Basically Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is accidentally exposed to gamma rays while working in his lab, and as a result whenever he gets angry he turn into a green monster with great strength, agility and a big roar, the Hulk. His close friend and co-worker Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) is the only person who can keep him calm, and the people mainly responsible for getting him angry most of the time are Betty's soldier father Ross (Sam Elliott) and his attacking troops, or Bruce's father David Banner (Nick Nolte) who has given himself abilities as a result of gamma radiation. Also starring Josh Lucas as Talbot, Kevin Rankin as Harper, Stan Lee as Security Guard and Lou Ferrigno as Security Guard. The special effects are good, in particular the Hulk's facial expressions, but Ang Lee (The Ice Storm, Brokeback Monuntain) is the wrong choice for director, the acting and dialogue is ridiculously comic-book like, and the editing made like frames of a comic may be innovative, but it's annoying. I think this is a film mainly the kids will like, worth seeing at least once for the rest of us. Okay!",Hulk
8,ccthemovieman-1,"Better Late Than Never, I Suppose",6,25 September 2007,"Boy, this got panned by a lot of people when it came out. Most of the criticism was probably warranted, but it wasn't all that bad a film. Mostly - but not all. It had its entertaining segments. The second scene with ""The Hulk,"" with him fighting three dogs was very intense.One of the problems was that it took 41 minutes for our hero, ""The Hulk,"" to show up! Hey, for a cartoon-as-a-movie, that's too long for the audience to wait. Don't get me wrong: I don't want one of these brainless nonstop action movies, but this was a tad too much in other direction. It needed just a little more spark to keep the young audience, which it should have known was going to watch this.For adults with a brain, it also needed to offer us something other than the Hollywood cliché villain - the military. Puh-leeze....how much longer with these liberal loonies keep bashing the military? This has been going on since the '60s and ""Dr. Strangelove"" and its getting worse over the years. Now our comic book heroes have become left wing revolutionaries, too? Give it a rest, or should I say, ""move on?""At least they gave Lou Ferrigno a guest shot. That was a nice touch. Lou played the ""monster"" on the successful TV series.One reviewer summed it up best: too slow for kids; too dumb for adults.",Hulk
9,Quinoa1984,"One of the few comic book adaptations grounded on the theme of mood over action; pros to serious movie-goers, cons to others",8,24 July 2003,"Ang Lee's filmed version of The Hulk, unfortunately, won't appeal to all those within the mainstream spectrum of movie-goers. I can guess (hearing from a few of my friends who are true-blue comic book addicts)fans of the comic will be pleased, however those who may not be fans or admirers and are simply looking for the kind of non-stop action and campy, tongue-in-cheek humor of Spiderman may be disappointed. Ang Lee has taken Stan Lee's vision of the ultimate perturbed anti-hero and created a work that can appeal to viewers with an darker art-house sensibility as well as viewers with a thirst for action-adventure blockbusters. In a sense this is similar to the approach Tim Burton used for Batman fourteen years ago, though his was given a shot of adrenaline and hilarity from Jack Nicholson as The Joker. The Hulk doesn't really have any overtly flamboyant characters like that to chew on the scenes they steal, so rather Lee looks at its core as a story of parents (notably fathers) and their children. Children who are tainted from missing and shattered childhoods from their before they can completely remember. Sam Elliot's Solider and Nick Nolte's Cast-out Father, perhaps, are the most important characters of the film after the protagonist Bruce Banner, as that they set the Jekyll and Hyde-esquire story in motion and carry/deliver much of the emotional weight that follows.Eric Bana is scientist Bruce Banner, un-wittingly following in his father's combustible career, who wants to use gamma-radiation to help out frogs in studies, and unfortunately gets caught in an accident of catastrophic proportions. There is, he finds out, something inside of him, ever since he was a child, that gets released into the open by the radiation, and the monster within becomes an unstoppable freak of nature. The gorgeous Jennifer Connelly plays his once love interest and only true friend, Betty Ross, who gets caught in a crossroads after her father, a military man who put away Banner's father away thirty years earlier, gets involved in the pursuit. It isn't just Lee's interest in getting to know who these characters ARE that makes the film fascinating, but in his stylizing of the medium- he has split screens in moments we'd never expect that give the film a comic-book edge, just how when reading one we may look at two or three of the pictures at once for it to sink in. His use of close-ups creates an intensity in seeing and getting to know these people. Rarely in a superhero movie does one look so intently at the eyes.A major drawback, I felt, were the action set pieces. They were certainly above the texture of the Spiderman scenes, yet the Hulk never looks truly real enough to commit total sympathy or other emotional connection to him. The fight scene with three dogs is one of the best fights of the summer, and a climax with Banner and his father is a near powerhouse, but the climax just before it goes on for far longer than it should. But, I suppose that notion could be considered Sour Grapes since I've never read a Hulk comic and only seen snippets of the old TV show. By the end of this character-driven roller coaster, I knew I had seen a well made comic-book adaptation, better than most I've seen in recent memory. But I wanted more, or perhaps less, than what I was given. Notle, by the way, has crazy Oscar-calibert-meets-campy work here, as does the editing by Tim Squyres.",Hulk
10,sunwarrior13,Ang Lee Takes Hulk Into New Places,8,13 October 2012,"Hulk is a superhero film based on the fictional Marvel Comics character of the same title. Ang Lee directed the film, which stars Eric Bana as Dr. Bruce Banner, as well as Jennifer Connelly, Sam Elliott, Josh Lucas, and Nick Nolte. The film explores the origins of the Hulk, which is partially attributed to Bruce Banner's father's experiments on himself, and on his son.Emotionally stunted Dr. Bruce Banner is part of a research team at the University of California at Berkeley. Corporate hustler Glenn Talbot takes notice of the lab and makes plans to take it over. Then Bruce accidentally gets hit by an experimental ray and grows into a huge beast, destroying the lab in the process. A creepy janitor who claims to be his real father, Dr. David Banner, starts to secretly use the experimental ray on himself. He creates some mutant dogs and sends them after Bruce's lab mate and ex-girlfriend Betty Ross. After Bruce saves her life in the form of the Hulk, she lets her distant father, General Ross, take him to an abandoned army base in the desert. However, Glenn Talbot takes over the operation and wants to patent the creature's superpowers for his own profit, so he holds Bruce unconscious in an isolation tank. When provoked, Bruce turns into the Hulk and makes a break for San Francisco, leading to a desert chase sequence involving military aircraft, tanks, and bombs. Only the sight of Betty can make him turn back to his human form. When he is eventually captured, Dr. David Banner shows up for a final confrontation with his son and his old adversary, General Ross.Despite the profusion of computer-generated effects, which rousingly bring the green guy to life, I often felt, for better and for worse, that I was watching a comic-book movie reconceived as a piece of serious myth-making.While Ang Lee's ambitious film earns marks for style and an attempt at dramatic depth, there's ultimately too much talking and not enough smashing.But despite of its problems it has as a story, at least Hulk tried, honestly and desperately, to push the comic book move into new places emotionally and stylistically.It remains an entertaining film.",Hulk

13,Theo Robertson,"What Constitutes A "" Bad "" Film ?",5,3 December 2012,"With art everything is subjective . How many times for example have you seen a pop song top the charts that you can't stand ? Conversely you can have a musical artist on your ipod that's always playing that most other people have little knowledge of . It's the same with cinema . Something like TITANIC breaks all sorts of box office records and scoops eleven Oscars but no one I know has a good word to say about it . And because it made so much money and scooped so many awards it's difficult to say it is a bad movie . We can only be subjective in saying it' painfully over rated One criteria you can perhaps judge a movie on being "" bad"" is to watch the box office placing . If a film hits the box office top ten chart at say number two then a week later it falls several places this indicates that it's driven by marketing hype and audience word of mouth has neutralized the marketing and no one wants to watch it . May I predict this might be the case with THE HOBBIT ? There might be another aspect to judge a film and it goes something like this ....One time I was at a university film class and the film we were discussing was HULK by Ang Lee . Nobody had a good word for it . One person claimed it was literally too much of a comic book with the panels being utterly distracting . One person claimed the characters were under developed while another claimed it was far too talkative to hold their interest . My criticism of HULK was none of the above but the opinion that the CGI was dreadful and that no time when Eric Bana turned in to the Hulk I was taken out of the movie since I couldn't believe that the Hulk existed in the same dimension as the live action - it was merely something that was created on a computer that resembled a cartoon This is a great pity because I could see that Lee was trying to make a film that was a little bit different from the mainstream but has failed to a degree . That said it's not a terrible film . It stayed in the US box office for four weeks and was the 14th highest grossing in America in 2003 so using my own criteria it's probably only a slightly mediocre film",Hulk

15,poolandrews,Better than I expected.,5,2 February 2011,"Hulk is set in San Francisco where research scientist Bruce Krensler (Eric Bana) is working on a revolutionary technique to allow instant regeneration of injuries using small Nanomeds & high levels of Gamma radiation but thus far with unstable results. While trying to save a fellow scientist from a laboratory accident Bruce is accidentally subjected to a high dosage of the Gamma radiation but incredibly survives unhurt, while recovering Bruce is visited by his father David Banner (Nick Nolte) whom he hasn't seen since he was a child. David tells Bruce that he too was subjected to radiation & that he passed his genetic power on, Bruce doesn't believe him but soon does as whenever he now becomes angry Bruce turns into a 10 foot tall green skinned monster of incredible strength. The military capture Bruce but he escapes in search of his girlfriend Betty Ross (Jennife Connelly) whose father Gneral Ross (Sam Elliott) has orders to kill Bruce while his father David wants to harness Bruce's power for himself...Directed by Ang Lee who seems an odd choice considering his art-house roots & the prior international success he had with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) this is yet another big budget Hollywood adaptation of a Marvel comic character, created by Stan Lee & Jack Kirby the character of The Incredible Hulk first appeared in 1962 but was not a success at the time & was dropped although he did eventually get his own comic book again in 1968 which I think is still going strong. The script here adds loads of back-story to the Bruce Banner character & the reasons why he has become the Hulk, none of this was in the comic books & the first forty minutes of exposition is fairly forgettable with numerous flashbacks. To be honest not a lot happens for the first forty minutes but once the Hulk makes it's first appearance the film picks up considerably & is actually quite a lot of fun to watch as the Hulk battles, tanks, helicopters, rampages around fighting mutant Dog's & leaping 1000's of feet into the air. I was a bit disappointed there wasn't a stronger villain here, sure there's General Ross who isn't that bad after all & Bruce's father who is totally wasted until the lasted five minutes (what did happen to him anyway?) & maybe even the Hulk itself has a shout at being as much of a villain as anyone else but it's a surprising omission not to have a recognisable bad guy with some sort of outlandish sci-fi plan to take over or destroy the world & in that sense the Hulk never really gets to act like a superhero, he never gets to save the world or defeat a great villain with incredible power & as such feels different from many comic book adaptations. The script deals quite heavily with Bruce's back-story & psychological issues as he has nightmares about his parents & has repressed fears about himself & who he is although none of it is that deep to be honest. At a little over two hours long if you can get past the slightly slow opening forty minutes then the last hour & a half move along like a rocket as the Hulk dominates the action, although not the best superhero comic book film out there Hulk isn't bad in it's own right & I actually enjoyed it more than I though I would.Ang Lee tries to turn his film literally into a comic book with all sorts of visual tricks, there are loads of split screen shots which obviously try to replicate the look of a comic book panel along with various cool dissolves including wipes & morphs & animated little genetic interludes between scenes which I did actually like & thought looked very stylish & cool. The CGI computer effects are mixed, generally they are excellent expect that the Hulk never looks real, he looks just like what it is a computer graphic although an incredibly good & detailed one at that. Scenes of him looking sad & trying to make the audience feel sorry for him just come across as silly looking. I'm not sure about the merits of having a mutant French Poodle feature either.With a supposed budget of about $137,000,000 no expense was spared & the film looks great, the Utah desert scenery is amazing. Very different fro the TV series The Incredible Hulk & the subsequent films that it spawned this didn't do that well at the box-office even though a sequel did made even if it changed the entire cast & story. The acting is alright, I though Bana & Connelly made for bland leads while Elliott & Nolte are wasted.Hulk has it's moments, it tries to be deep & doesn't quite pull it off. Certainly the films at it's most entertaining when the Hulk is on screen smashing things & not when the dull psychological drama & flashbacks are playing out. A decent enough effort & better than I expected anyway. Followed by a complete reboot The Incredible Hulk (2008).",Hulk
16,dbborroughs,Incredibly Boring,3,16 May 2004,"Word on this was mixed, people either loved it or hated it and having watched this twice put me into the loath it group.Technically this is one of the best looking comic films ever made. My guess is that had the TV show producers had the technology they might have made something that looked like this. The fact that they didn't is a real shame since what they lacked in special effects budget they made up for in the story department. The film makers here had the opposite problem, a special effects budget but no story.The film has been praised as being deeply thoughtful. My guess is that people confuse ""meaningful"" silences for meaning. The vast majority of this film comes across as people looking intently not saying anything, granted its a metaphor for the inability to speak, or act, and that the Hulk is the opposite, the man of unrestrained action, or some such garbage, what ever it is its boring and there is no point trying to find deep meaning in it.The performances are flatter than the comic book. Sam Elliot is one note. Jennifer Connelly is so stiff I thought she had her Oscar give the performance. The worst is Eric Bana who is so stiff, so empty, so un-breathing that all I can do is wonder where in the hell they dug his corpse up? I wouldn't call his performance a performance, unless you think the creations in a wax museum perform. He isn't bad, he isn't good he's just there. I screamed at one point ""Will you do something?"" only to be rightfully told to shut up, after all inanimate objects don't move. Buildings and statues in the background have more personality than Bana.Much of the problem I have to lay at the feet of director Ang Lee who seems to have put together a film of discards, he got rid of everything but the silence. What was he thinking? You can't even get lost in the action since the Hulk doesn't even show up until an hour into the movie, and then the score runs counter to any excitement the scenes might generate.I don't know what these people were thinking.What I do know is that I hope never to see this movie again.",Hulk
17,utgard14,"""Angry Man is unsecure.""",5,2 June 2014,"What a disappointment this one was. Back when it came out, I was one of the first in line to see it. My brother and I were Hulk fans from way back. We thought this would be the chance for the Hulk to shine on the big screen. Who knew that, instead of a fun comic book movie, we'd get a gloomy oddity about some guy with daddy issues?Eric Bana apparently studied acting in a lumberyard. Jennifer Connelly gives another of her expectedly depressing turns. These two as leads hurt the movie more than anything. They soak up the somber tone of the script and drip melancholy for two hours. Sam Elliott and Nick Nolte give the best performances. In Nolte's case, however, his character is part of the film's many problems. The origin story is overcomplicated and it would have been better served without Nolte's character in it. He's a weak ""villain"" and his climactic battle with the Hulk is confusing and unsatisfying.On the plus side, Danny Elfman's score is very good. The special effects are better than their reputation suggests. Hulk has been referred to as looking like Shrek. The only time this is sort of true are in the close-ups. Why Ang Lee did so many close-ups of that obviously cartoon face I'll never know. The scenes of the Hulk destroying things and fighting the military are among the film's few exciting moments. What the hell was with the dogs? Dumb. Just dumb.The gimmick of using ""comic book style"" split-screens is distracting and doesn't fit the super serious tone of the movie. But if you ever wanted to know what it would look like if Brian De Palma directed the Hulk, I guess this is a good indicator. The movie's watchable but its somber tone and lack of fun do it in. I can't help but feel that if this exact same film were directed by a nobody instead of Ang Lee, its number of defenders would drop from few to zero.",Hulk
18,zardoz-13,Far Too Serious For Its' Own Good . . .,7,6 February 2008,"You can always tell when a movie takes itself far too seriously. Not only does Taiwanese director Ang Lee stretch ""Hulk"" to the breaking point over an overwhelming two-hour plus running time, but also he violates the cardinal rule: 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it.' First, Lee and Universal have omitted the adjective ""Incredible"" from the Marvel Comics title. Instead of ""The Incredible Hulk,"" it's simply ""Hulk."" No big deal,unless you are a hardcore ""Hulk"" fan. Second, whenever Hollywood feels self-conscious about how absurd some of its summer sagas seem, they endeavor to dignify them. Lee and Universal have gone to drastic lengths to turn ""Hulk"" into a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions. While this bombastic revision of Jack Kirby & Stan Lee's tragic mutant hero may enhance the literary status of ""Hulk,"" audiences impatient for action rather than angst may chafe at these changes, especially when they have to wait about 40 minutes for their first glimpse of the ""Hulk."" Furthermore, they have changed Bruce Banner's back story with the introduction of Bruce's dad David, who emerges as a child molester and a wife-killer. Imagine how that is going to play to the under-20 audience? Beware of dad, he might tamper with your genetic make-up. Third, Lee and his writers have given us three villains who barely register with the strength of one, and only one decent but drawn-out daylight scene of the jade green giant having a tantrum. Essentially, ""Hulk"" qualifies as nothing more than a ""Hulk"" of a movie. Mind you, everything admirable that Lee and company have done to upgrade the story backfires. ""Hulk"" is too long, too complicated, and too tame. Although the Hulk himself looks formidable up close (they based his expressions on the director's face more than Eric Bana's visage), he looks ridiculous in the long shots, especially when he bounces along the desert like a giant green jackrabbit.Anybody who knows anything about ""The Hulk"" knows Jack Kirby and Stan Lee created this gargantuan galoot back in 1962 in a series of six Marvel Comics. According to Lee, ""Hulk"" was not green at first but gray. Unfortunately, gray didn't translate as a consistent color scheme, so Lee changed him when they revived ""Hulk."" No, I'm not a ""Hulk"" fan, but I know ""Hulk"" fans. Moreover, I've seen the Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno TV pilot episode of ""The Incredible Hulk"" as well as the three NBC-TV movies that followed after CBS-TV canceled the series. ""The Incredible Hulk,"" which lasted from 1977 to 1982, remains the longest-running super-hero TV show. Originally, in the Marvel Comics, a bomb explosion transformed Bruce Banner into ""The Hulk."" When the TV show premiered, Bruce (whose name got changed to David because CBS-TV felt Bruce sounded too wimpy) absorbed too much radiation in a lab experiment he conducted on himself. You can see where Lee and his three scenarists, long-time collaborator James Schamus of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" Michael France of ""Cliffhanger"" & ""GoldenEye,"" and newcomer John Turner of the 1998 TV movie ""The Crow: Stairway to Heaven,"" drew their inspiration for Bruce's deviously degenerate dad. In ""Hulk,"" David (Nick Nolte of ""48 HRS"") behaves like Dr. Frankenstein by monkeying around with his own DNA against the orders of project supervisor General ""Thunderbolt' Ross (Sam Elliot of ""We Were Soldiers"") who threatens to pull the plug on the project. Seems that dear old dad not only conducted tests on himself, but also he had conducted genetic experiments on his innocent son. Eventually, Ross banishes David Banner from his research lab and imprisons for homicide. Meanwhile, Bruce grows up with foster parents. Ironically, he becomes a scientist, too, following in his father's footsteps. Bruce (Aussie actor Eric Bana of ""Black Hawk Down"") and Betty Ross (Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Connelly of ""A Beautiful Mind"") are working on a way to regenerate damaged cells when sleazy corporate headhunter Glenn Talbot (Josh Lucas of ""Glory Road"") shows up to takeover the project. During a lab snafu, Bruce exposes himself accidentally to gamma rays and develops an anger management problem. When he gets really ticked off, he turns into a 15-foot monster who looks an overgrown Hobbit. Things sour even more when he learns that the lab janitor is none other than daddy, back with a vengeance to wreck havoc on him as well as everybody else.Director Ang Lee, whose impressive credits include ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" ""Sense and Sensibility,"" and ""Ride with the Devil,"" treats the superhero subject matter with respect than you'd imagine and evokes strong performances from his gifted cast. Finally, when Lee shows the Hulk in all of his great green glory, Lee conceals him in darkness during a life and death fight with three mutant dogs, one of them a clipped white French poodle, dispatched by dad to kill Bruce's ex-flame Betty. This harrowing nocturnal fight is the best thing about ""Hulk,"" even though it resembles a homage to Stephen King's ""Cujo."" Of course, ""King Kong"" fans will recognize the resemblance between this ruckus and Kong's fight with the dinosaurs in the 1933 classic. All of the villains live up to their villainy, but some more than others. Glenn Talbot goads Bruce with a cattle-prod in one scene, but he exits far too early for us to free anything more than relief. Meanwhile, David Banner undergoes his own mutation, never adequately explained, and turns into a Magneto/T-2 Terminator monster. Through it all, Lee directs this misfire of a movie with a heavy-hand. They talk, talk, and talk. Sometimes, they snarl. Sam Elliot mainly snarls as Gen. Ross. Then we get the big finale where the ""Hulk"" goes toe to toe with helicopters, jet fighters, and tanks. Reluctantly, I'd give this sequence the only star that this misbegotten movie deserves, but if you've seen the remake of ""King Kong"" (1976) it's painfully obvious where they got their ideas. Worst, ""The Hulk"" lacks any semblance of humor.",Hulk
19,Boba_Fett1138,Me like Hulk!,8,15 February 2005,"Movie lovers will appreciate this movie far better than the lets say the average teenager. ""Hulk"" is very different than any other superhero movie from the last couple of years. The movie is not aimed for the average teenagers audience that liked movies like ""X-Men"" and ""X2"", ""Hulk"" has more drama than action and more substance than entertainment.I really like what Ang Lee made of this movie. He gave the characters some real depth and the story emotion. The use of the special effects are subtle and not made to impress the audience with but are really used as a tool to tell the story, unlike many other movies from the same superhero genre. All in all this movie might very well the best comic book adaptation so far, with a real good comic book atmosphere.The thing I liked most about this movie was the editing. I was really disappointed that this movie didn't even got an Oscar nomination for best editing. It might very well be the best I've seen in a movie and lots of wonderful editing tricks are used to give this movie an extra kind of comic book feeling.I didn't expected too much from Danny Elfman's musical score, particularly not after ""Spider-Man"" that in my opinion had a weak unfitting score. But I should had known better, after all this is that man that also brought us the famous ""Batman"" music. The score for ""Hulk"" really was excellent and is one I enjoy listening to.Nick Nolte really was a pleasure to watch in this movie but oh boy did he looked sick (that was because he was constantly drunk on the set), he completely played Eric Bana of the screen at the end. This movie is recommendable to everyone as long as you are not expecting a superhero movie with lot's of action and special effects and a stereotype villain. I really hope ""Hulk 2"" will be made some day, with Ang Lee at the helm again.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Hulk
20,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Could have been better,6,6 March 2004,"I guess one of the biggest problem with this film is the so-so acting of Eric Bana. Every scene he's in, that involves him to participate in a dialogue or show emotion is badly acted, in my opinion. At times I found myself laughing at how bad he actually was. Something that also ruined a lot of the movie was the transitions; they were mostly bad, and very misplaced, and took the feeling or intensity out of the scenes. That's probably the biggest mistake the movie makes. The plot is pretty good, considering how much it strays away from the original story of the Hulk character. The acting is sometimes decent, sometimes laughable. Unfortunately, mostly the latter. Eric Bana as mentioned earlier, and Sam Elliott both perform pretty badly. The special effects are incredible; definitely the best thing about this movie, with the action scenes(mostly) coming in a close second. The action is mostly good, though I found some scenes, especially the very last one, somewhat dull. It could have accomplished a bit more, I think. I guess fans of the Hulk character, especially his rage, might enjoy this. Most other people may enjoy the sci-fi aspect of the film, or maybe even the drama aspect. I can't say I particularly enjoyed a lot of this film, except for the few good action scenes, and the state-of-the-art special effects, of course. Most of the rest of the film is nothing special. I recommend this to big fans of comic book movies, and fans of the original comic book, who are not uptight about the story being changed around a bit. 6/10",Hulk
21,view_and_review,Purely Pathetic,3,22 July 2004,"I'm a huge Marvel Comics fan, and Hulk would have to be my favorite if not second favorite Comic just after X-Men. I can't remember ever anticipating a movie so much and being so disappointed. Never mind that I got to the theater an hour early expecting a long line, but then I had to wait through a long build up just to get to the meat of the movie. Every movie has its build up, but I had to sit for what seemed like hours just to get to the point where Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) becomes the Hulk. The writer made Bruce's childhood too crucial to the plot and to the fact Bruce became Hulk. Not only was this extremely unnecessary, but it would have been sufficient to capture Bruce's childhood as a flashback. The story was absolutely terrible. Instead of keeping the story simple, the writer made it complex. The whole movie you're waiting to see what childhood event made Bruce Banner particularly ""special"" (as his father called him) and prone to later becoming a monster. Then after the slow drama and disconnected seemingly non-related events, you find out that Bruce's father (Nick Nolte) experimented on his son when he was a toddler. Bruce becomes the Hulk later on as a scientist which doesn't stray too far away from the comic book, but it seemed the writer could not come up with a decent foe. So Hulk ends up battling the army at times, which was actually pretty good, but then he battles some overgrown dogs!? And for the finale he battles his father who has been given powers through the same accident that made Bruce the Hulk!? It wasn't so bad that he battled his father, but the villain that his father was SUCKED. He had the ability to transform into any matter he touched, so at the end he BITES into an electrical cable, hence becoming living electricity!? TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE. I rated this movie a three out of ten, and the three was strictly for the excellent CGI. And that is another thing that made this movie so disappointing. Here it is a movie that did a tremendous job on making the Hulk appear realistic, then they blow the movie with a terrible story. My suggestion: Get rid of most of the drama and slow points, and bring forth a formidable villain like Leader, Juggernaut, Doc Samson, etal",Hulk
22,neil-476,Either/or,6,16 January 2008,"Hulk tries to be all touchy/feely for the new age/romcom crowd, and eye candy beat 'em up for the comic crowd. As a result, it falls between two stools and satisfies neither group.I own up to being one of the comic crowd. I didn't go to this movie to see angst and emotional upheaval and shades of half-remembered child abuse. I went to see a big green brainless dude throwing tanks over the horizon. So I thoroughly enjoyed the latter part of the film, but there was much which I feel merited criticism.1. Presumably the revised origin was so as to bring the abuse thing in. Nothing wrong with the comic origin, though - they should have used it.2. Get on with it! Far too much twittering around before Hulking out set in.3. Sam Elliott - mumbled his way through with an expression like a bloke with a mouth full of bumblebees. Sounded like it, too. And the moustache means you can't even try to lipread.4.

23,evanston_dad,"The Horror, the Horror....",2,29 April 2005,"I so wanted to give this film a better review, because if nothing else, ""Hulk"" at least takes a more interesting than average approach to the comic-book-turned-into-summer-blockbuster genre. Ang Lee gets kudos from me for his use of split screens to suggest the panels of a comic book, but that's about where my praise ends. Because I usually like Lee, I'm giving this two stars instead of one, but I'm doing that under duress. ""Hulk"" is dreadful. It's 140 minutes of nonsense, which might be o.k. if that nonsense had any notion that it was nonsense. But Lee and company seem to take their material utterly seriously, which is deadly for this kind of film. Lee uses the comic book look for his film, but he doesn't use the comic book tongue-in-cheek style of story-telling, so every single scene comes across as unintentionally silly. Even with that, the film might have been enjoyable. Hey, I enjoy a fun bad movie as much as the next guy. But this is a fun bad movie without the fun.The story takes forever to get going, and once it does it doesn't make a lot of sense anyway. I can't believe I'm saying this, but this is one case where the story overwhelms the visuals. I don't really need that much back story to the Hulk---what I want are cool action sequences and zingy special effects. Well, the effects in this suck. I almost have to believe the CG animation in this film was intentionally corny, otherwise the producers got seriously ripped off. The only thing I can say about the animated Hulk is that he's a better actor than Eric Bana, who plays Bruce Banner. Please don't ask this boy to act, and especially don't ask him to cry. Jennifer Connelly is starting to really get on my nerves. She's stealing the market on noble suffering away from Joan Allen. But the real booby prize goes to Nick Nolte, who has driven another nail into the coffin of his career with his appearance in this. He's absolutely putrid, chewing the scenery every chance he gets in a greasy fright wig. His big showy soliloquy toward the end might have been more effective if the viewer could understand a word he says, but I doubt it. Perhaps the filmmakers should have chosen to use a CG version of Nick Nolte instead of the real thing.And darned if this movie doesn't suffer from action movie syndrome, complete with false finale and a real finale that is jaw-droppingly wretched. $100 bucks to anyone who can make sense of what happens at the end, and who can also tell me how all of the people back at the military base were able to see the big battle between the Hulk and Nick Nolte as if they were watching it on screen as we are, even though they are miles away watching nothing more than a radar screen.Bad, bad, bad.....Grade: D-",Hulk
24,ferguson-6,Nice puppy ...,6,24 June 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Another in a line of movie versions for comic book characters.  For the most part these have been handled pretty well.  ""The Hulk"" is no exception.  Far from perfect, very adult, but mostly watchable.  Director Ang Lee (who crafted the mesmerizing ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"")provides us with a dark, message-filled, CGI overloaded film that will not have you smiling or chuckling, but if you are over 18, you will find the story a bit unsettling.  The story dwells on Bruce Banner's (played fine by Ausie hunk, Eric Bana) mysterious father (Nick Nolte) and the testing that occurred when Bruce was under 4 years of age. Bruce, of course, unwittingly follows in his mad scientist father's footsteps and ends up in a lab with the gorgeous Jennifer Connelly - we should all be so lucky. NOTE: If you have never seen it, make sure you check out Connelly in ""The Hot Spot"" from 1990 - it's a gem.  The story takes off when Banner's dad reappears after 30 years with a couple of ""unstable"" pooches.  The film does deliver the necessary HULK action, although at times the picture is muddled and it is difficult to tell what is happening.  My biggest problem with the film is Ang Lee's attempt at creative filmmaking using the worthless split screen imaging and an onslought of close-ups.  On the other hand, Nolte's performance, Connelly's face, Sam Elliott's snarling and Danny Elfman's score make this a winner.  The casting was brilliant for the young Nolte and Elliott characters.  And don't miss Lou Ferrigno (the orignial Hulk) and Stan Lee (creator of ""The Hulk"" and ""Spiderman"") walking out of a building together early in the movie.",Hulk

It regards massive problems that affect us mentally. For Bruce Banner that would be a childhood trauma that resulted in the imprisonment of his father. He realizes that a force surfaces inside him when his anger peaks. Detailed setup introduces Banner and co-worker Betty Ross, played by Jennifer Connelly testing research while an ominous figure poised as a janitor observes. Spectacular work by Ang Lee who previously made the excellent Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Eric Bana is engaging as Banner whose past is a blur but he fights to use his condition towards good. When he transforms into the raging green Hulk he is misunderstood by all except Ross. Connelly provides understanding and sympathy as she is targeted for danger yet protected by Hulk. She knows in the end what viewers are given a glimpse of when all seems gone. Sam Elliott plays her military father who previously shut down the lab. Now he faces new dilemmas that involve his daughter. Nick Nolte brings forth a father functioning by mistakes. Josh Lucas plays a sinister former soldier attempting to force Banner and Ross to work for him. The Hulk's battles against tanks are impressive mirroring our expectations.

26,AaronCapenBanner,"Not Bad, But A Misfire.",4,25 August 2013,"Feature film adaption of the comic book character, and classic TV series, is an honorable but failed attempt to use CGI, lots of explosions, and comic book paneled scenes to tell the story of how Bruce Banner(Eric Bana, a good choice) becomes the Hulk. Also in the excellent cast are Betty Ross(beautiful Jennifer Connelly) and her father General Ross(Sam Elliot, grizzled and effective as always). With such fine actors, it is dismaying that this goes off the rails, with an ambitious but overly melodramatic plot about Banner's parents, and how the whole thing is a tragic conspiracy... this does not work, and too much CGI takes you right out of the film, with an absurd climax, though the last scene, where a very familiar line is uttered, is a real treat for fans, but also a reminder on how the TV series will always be preferred!",Hulk

Perhaps Ang Lee wasn't the best choice for this film. When one goes to see a Hulk movie, they want high action and massive destruction, not a highly dramatic snooze-fest for most of the movie only to give some little fan service towards the end of the film. To say I was let down from the film is a bit of an understatement, the film is just NOT true to the characters in the least, especially the ending fight, which is so absurd, so confusing, and so utterly contemptible toward the comic that it's based on that I was itching to just get out of the theater (actually I did leave, only to watch the film in full on DVD to give it a second chance) Upon second viewing, did I like it more?

28,Aaron1375,"I enjoyed it, but it isn't for everyone.",8,21 June 2003,"This movie isn't going to be the huge success some thought, but I really enjoyed it myself.  The problem is the serious tone almost throughout the movie and the fact it takes awhile for the Hulk to make an appearance. Myself, I thought the story was great and interesting enough for me to be entertained, but I don't see this one being universally loved.  Nothing wrong with those who don't like it, it just isn't a movie that is going to appeal to everyone.  It did me, and I just hope it does well enough to warrant a sequel as it is sure to contain the Abomination, and trust me more people would love it.  This one though is set up and serious set up at that. In fact older people may be more inclined to enjoy this than younger ones who need explosions every two minutes.  The CGI looks rather good, not groundbreaking...for me though it was acceptable.  The close ups are great and those who have been complaining since day one could at least say the close up shots of the Hulk were very well done.  Sam Elliot is very good as General Ross, as is the entire cast.  I gave this one a 9, only because I thought the end was a bit anticlimactic especially after the desert fights and the San Francisco scenes.  All in all though I thought it was a good ride, but if a more serious comic book movie doesn't appeal to you I would skip it...if though you feel you can accept a more serious movie by all means this is the one you should come to.",Hulk
29,Wuchakk,A convoluted drama and THE INCREDIBLE HULK,7,23 April 2012,"Director Ang Lee's 2003 ""Hulk"" is a worthwhile rendition of Marvel's Hulk. Like the '08 version, it has its strengths and weaknesses. Let's look at what works and what doesn't work: WHAT WORKS: What I'm most impressed with is the serious, intelligent, respectable manner in which the story is presented. There are no goofy, campy elements to be found.Most of the casting is good: Sam Elliott as General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross and Josh Lucas as Glen Talbot.Ang Lee shows off his filmmaking skill with various creative editing/framing techniques (supposedly giving the feel of a comic book). I've never seen this type of work in any other film, particularly not to this degree of innovation. It works for me.I think they did an excellent job with the appearance of the Hulk. Since they were endeavoring to show the REAL Hulk, the one that throws tanks around and jumps across the landscape, they had no choice but to go the CGI route. They did the best they could with the technology available at the time and it holds up a decade later. Hey, it's better than a big body-builder painted green! Without doubt, the best part of the film is the 22-minute rampage of the Hulk that starts at the 92-minute mark. This IS the Hulk! The enthralling sequence realistically shows the Hulk taking on the military as was often portrayed in the comics. This is definitely one of the best action sequences ever put to film. Make no mistake, the DVD is worth owning for this 22-minute episode alone! WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The drama is presented in a lazy, convoluted way that somehow detaches the viewer from the film, but I'm okay with it as long as I put on a pot of coffee, lol. This will naturally turn-off Hulk fans who were expecting a fast-paced, simplistic ""Hulk will SMASH"" story.Some of the casting is questionable, like Eric Bana as Bruce Banner. Some criticize him as ""wooden"" but this isn't what I object to as it's the point of the character. Although Bana is certainly likable in the role, and I've gotten used to him, he just doesn't exude Bruce Banner as depicted in the comics or the TV series; he's too much of a handsome muscleman who looks like he could kick some serious arse without turning into the Hulk, which takes away from the whole concept. By contrast, both Bill Bixby and Edward Norton fit the character. Then there's Nick Nolte as Bruce's father, David Banner, the ""Absorbing Man."" It took me quite a while to get used to his role in this film, but I'm okay with it now.Some may object to the deviations made to the origin of the hulk and that these changes slow the story down and needlessly complicate it. In the comic Bruce Banner became the Hulk after accidentally being exposed to gamma rays from a huge government test-bomb in the desert. In the film the Hulk's origin is complicated by being tied to Bruce's mad scientist father who experimented on him when he was a little boy. Although one has to allow some latitude in comic-to-film translation these changes definitely slow the story down and make the origin less immediately gratifying. BUT it does offer a father/son conflict to the table.CONCLUSION: The positive aspects noted above make ""Hulk"" at least a 3/5 Star film. What I like best is the highly mature tone (Roger Ebert called it ""a thinking man's superhero film"") and the enthralling 22-minute rampage, which is worth the price of admission. But the changes in the origin story slow the film down and are presented in a generally convoluted way that lacks drive. Yet, at the same time, I appreciate the yin/yang extremes of the plot; it makes for a unique viewing experience.In any case, the 22-minute rampage that starts at the 92-minute mark is the Hulk to a 'T' and one of the most entertaining comic-action sequences in the history of film.Despite being based on a comic book (and TV show), ""Hulk"" is not a fast-food comic flick like, say, the 90's Batman films. This is an intelligent, well-crafted piece of cinematic art that just so happens to involve a rampaging green behemoth. At 138 minutes the film's a bit overlong, but that's okay. Just put on a pot of coffee (you're gonna need it, lol), kick back and enjoy the movie magic. This is what I just did and the film gave me a great time. I value the '03 and '08 versions equally, but I prefer the way the Hulk looks in this version; he's more realistic whereas the Hulk in the '08 version comes off overly cartooney, albeit grittier. GRADE: B+",Hulk
30,zetes,"Adequately entertaining, nothing more",7,20 June 2003,"Ang Lee tries hard to make the film good, but his efforts to inject substance and art to the project are misguided. Why couldn't he have just tried to make it fun? Last year's Spider-Man fulfilled a lot of that promise. The Hulk (or Hulk  imdb provides the `The,' which isn't in the main title of the film or on any of the posters) does entertain when action strikes. There are at least three great action sequences, although a couple of them take place at night, making them difficult to comprehend at times. The finale is especially muddled, and I could only barely tell what happened. But I had to love the Hulk  literal id. I want the sequel to be Bruce Banner-less. The rest of the movie is better than it ought to be, with particularly good performances from Jennifer Connelly (who seems to think she is vying for her next Oscar) and Nick Nolte (who is the only one who seems to know exactly which movie he's in).

32,StevePulaski,You might not like it when it's anglee,8,1 January 2012,"I'm very pleased that Ang Lee got his hands on the directing job for a multi-million dollar superhero flick. The idea of a very intelligent man handling the camera on a film for a Marvel hero is an excellent idea. Unfortunately, I don't speak for everyone. As a reviewer, I speak from personal enjoyment and predict if audiences will enjoy the film or not. Hulk is how a superhero film should be done. But due to the impatient public and the risk factors involved in trying to accomplish such a project it can be very difficult and that's why some think it's better to opt out of the decision to smarten up the formula.At the time of its release, Hulk was open to mixed reviews and a ho-hum box office performance. After a solid opening weekend, it began experiencing sharper declines every week and eventually faded into the dust. In 2008, the character got a reboot in a film called The Incredible Hulk. That one ""solved"" all the ""problems"" with this film by making the story focus less on the talking and more on the mindless, droning action sequences.To be fair, both have an ideal amount of charm. Even though the 2008 version was dubbed a ""reboot,"" I consider it more of a ""revival."" The only reason it was made was because of fan's disappointment with this adaptation. This one is for the backstory lovers like myself. The Incredible Hulk is for the ""less talky, more shooty"" type. I think it also tried to focus more on the Television series, where as this tries to be faithful to the comic book.The story revolves around Bruce Banner, who is played by Corey Feldman lookalike Eric Bana. Bruce's father, David, has mutant DNA and realizes that when his wife gave birth to his son that he passed it on. At a young age, Bruce was taken from his family after his father caused an explosion at the lab he was employed at and his memories of his biological parents are unknown.Years later, Bruce is a graduate from Berkeley working as a researcher in the field of nanomeds with his ex-girlfriend Betty Ross (Connelly). One night, Bruce encounters radiation exposure by accident while working on an experiment. Being that he already has mutant DNA, the encounter with the radiation creates an antagonistic effect on his body. Thus, when angry, now turns him into a raging green monster known as the Hulk.The green guy doesn't show up until the forty minute mark, and the first fight scene happens a little after an hour. The first half an hour or so is strictly backstory and character development. Like it should be, in my opinion. When we finally see the monster about a third of the way in, Ang Lee is smart to keep the fighting minimal. The fight scenes are well choreographed and make sense because of the story given. I'm so very tired of films like Transformers that feel the need to throw in a random, explanation free fight scene between two metal monstrosities for no apparent reason. And to carry the scene on for over an hour is painfully overdoing it. Ang Lee's Hulk is the most tolerable superhero movie in a long time because of its pacing and extreme care for the characters and the source material they're from.Is it boring? Sometimes. But in a strange way. Like, I'd rather see a different setup than an action scene. Some of the dialog is a bit hokey and hard to decipher, but since when has genetics ever been a simple concept? Thankfully, some of the dialog scenes on the subject of mutant DNA and genetics is kept to a minimum. Still, I'd favor that over mind-numbing nonsense any day.Hulk himself is somewhat impressive. But the attention to detail, even in the poster with the giant hand careening towards you, is exquisite in its presentation. The creature himself is motion capture, meaning we have new, unpolished technology in the making. His appearance is nice for the time, but two years later Peter Jackson's King Kong established motion capture can be used very nicely. The Hulk character is more of a special effects experiment than anything, and for that reason he flounders between the level of acceptable and mediocre.Ang Lee's art direction, complimented by Danny Elfman's music, also deserves some praise. Lee has somehow made an ugly, devilish green monster appealing. Most likely because we don't see him looking eye to evil-eye with the camera very often. We see his emotional side along with his destructive actions. Also, there are some very experimental editing techniques used. Obviously, the editor was aiming for a comic book style appearance. It works for the most part. The picture and picture style doesn't come off as obtrusive, mainly because it is used to enhance the experience - not to turn it into a gimmick.Hulk is a film that may or may not please fans of the comic book. In the field of action, it doesn't hold up. But when the action scenes do come around they're nicely done in the sense that they don't make too much unclear. The dialog scenes, for the most part, are well thought out and well executed mainly because of the cast's great chemistry. This is what you call a superhero movie for people who could care less about superhero movies.Starring: Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, and Nick Nolte. Directed by: Ang Lee.",Hulk
33,=G=,Kid stuff,6,2 November 2003,"""The Hulk"" is an obvious and simple minded effects-fest with a plot which is about as substantive as a Sunday morning cartoon. The film offers a good cast, excellent effects, and a whole bunch of surreal pseudoscientific nonsense built around a silly story line in which the good are nauseatingly good and the bad are not only bad but mean too. Lee screws around for 40 minute before we even get to see the hulk and then stretches his thin story to 2.3 hours in this protracted tale of the big green guy who I much preferred when ""Big Louie"" was playing him. Sucky but slick stuff which may appeal to infantile comic freaks. Ang Lee should go back to doing what he does best and make real people flicks again. (C)",Hulk

35,KineticSeoul,"Not incredible, but I appreciate it now.",6,16 June 2014,"This is a different sort of a superhero movie. When I first saw this movie as a kid, I thought it was just a boring movie in general. Watching it now, I actually have some appreciation when it came to Ang Lee's direction with this. I could tell he put a lot of his effort into this project and his visuals was artistically crafted into this. However despite the comic book like format and editing during certain scenes, this just didn't seem all that much like a comic book movie. Which is probably what majority of the audiences was looking forward to when buying tickets in theaters. I could tell Ang Lee wanted to put effort into making a story driven movie with emotions. Which I do appreciate during certain parts, but it does feel and seem a bit drawn out from time to time as well even if certain transitions is good. Despite the Hulk looking like some clay monster, the mass power, carnage and destruction is actually well done and entertaining. Especially the highlight scene of Hulk running from the military and fighting them off. I don't know about Eric Bana playing Bruce Banner, he just didn't seem like Bruce Banner. However Jennifer Conelly and Nick Nolte (even if there isn't really much for him to work with as a villain) really worked with their roles. Jennifer Conelly is just plain downright super pretty in this and made even the drawn out scenes watchable. Overall this is a Hulk movie that I appreciate, but wasn't really all that entertained with.6.9/10",Hulk
36,thesar-2,"Puny Humans, Indeed",5,1 December 2012,"I grew up on the Hulk. Let me start over – I grew up on TV's (Bill Bixby's) The Incredible Hulk. Oh, that and Wonder Woman (on TV that is – Superman was my movie hero) were it for me. Glued were my eyes whenever those two superheroes were on the small screen.That said, I had an open mind about the first (of two. Three?) Hulk outing on the big screen knowing that they'd probably revert back to the true legend of the Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde comic book character. Personally, I wanted the big-screen version of the TV show where no one knew who David (not Bruce) was and he was always on the run. But that wasn't in the cards.After watching Ang Lee's 2003's art-house take I had mixed feelings. I knew I wanted to like it more since it was one of my childhood favorites. I even watched it multiple more times in theatres and at home, because that's all I had for a ""new"" Hulk vs. all the TV reruns. I'm guessing people might have done the same when Star Trek: The Motion Picture was it for trekkers before The Wrath of Kahn came to pass.To this day, eight years after release plus one reboot, I'm still divided. Much like Jar Jar, I hated the father story then, and still do. There's other problems with the movie, but the number one is the complete father story. Eliminate that and it would've been oodles better. Notice: not replace, for it was far too long anyways.Adding in more Hulk burst-outs, heck – have at least one during the first 40 or so minutes and stop that annoying split screen/comic book look could have also aided in the movie's recovery. But these are here nor there, what's done was done.The positives were the casting – Eric Bana was great as Bruce Banner, Jennifer Connelly wonderful as Betty Ross and most of all, Sam Elliott was excellent as her father, General Ross. Also, despite the all-but neon green hulk, he did look real on the screen, for the most part. In addition, whenever he attempted lifting or smashing, it looked pretty darn real to what in my mind would happen. Case in point: when he tries to first lift/break the ""gamma"" emitting sphere and he hadn't counted on it being too heavy. And, with the tanks – with/without his strength, he would have some problems pulling them apart. These are just two examples of what they got right.Ang Lee admitted prior that he was not a fan and further, never picked up a Hulk comic book. He just wanted to make it from his mind. Sad. I'm not going to produce and star in a Shakespeare play without ever reading it. That's ignorance.And his showed. He tried far too many artsy ideas that normally work in his movies, but not in a COMIC BOOK MOVIE. He got so caught up with making it chichi he forgot his (MINE) fan base. Unless it's a comedy, I don't want to see Pride & Prejudice & Predators.In one of the best scenes, the Hulk is tearing up an underground government lair and at the most inopportune time, Lee reduces visibility with his multiple comic book panels. I was p|ssed and didn't want to pay any attention to what Lee wanted me to see on the screen other than the one that showed the Hulk smashing and prancing about. Lee also went further by switching back and forth between the styles: real time and his cartoonish freeze-frames and ""Batman POW!"" shots. It was as if he, himself, had little faith in what he was doing.It's not a basic plot – another problem for a COMIC BOOK MOVIE – but here's the quick synopsis: Daddy Banner (I refuse to call him what they named him, let's just say he was played horribly by Nick Nolte) was involved in mysterious experiments and after injecting himself against orders by General Ross, he inadvertently fathers a child who, of course, grows up and out as Bruce Banner.Daddy's locked away, while now-grown Bruce does similar experiments and blunders which triggers a jolly green ""angry man"" (their name for it, bleahh.) Everyone knows it's Bruce and everyone wants a piece of the green to make, well, more green.From there, it gets pretty over-complicated – again mainly from the Daddy-Issues. Suffice to say, Hulk will make just a few more appearances, some a little too big and even making it into San Francisco.Let me stop there. Much like The Lost World: Jurassic Park, how disappointing was it when you have a real-looking giant (sorry, Godzilla) enter a city for just a few minutes? But, even with the few precious moments we had him in a city setting, the movie absolutely should've ended right there becauseIn one of the worst endings in comic book movie history (or just about any film) come following. I do spill out spoilers in my reviews, but I won't ruin the ending for anybody curious. Suffice to say, one word: RIDICULOUS.Thank God, they did give Hulk another shot five years later – though not much better, but it was a bastard Hulk, thankfully. That's another story. As for 2003's Hulk, eh, give it as least one viewing. As bad as some of the film was, it could've been a lot worse.",Hulk
37,cherold,"What Dino De Laurentiis did to King Kong, Ang Lee does to the Hulk",2,14 May 2004,"I can't believe there are people who like this movie, which fails both as a standard action picture and as a deeper psychological study. It's just bad, with a dumb, poorly structured script. The movie it most reminded me of was the 1976 King Kong, which blew up the tight, simple original into a tedious, pretentious, waterlogged mess. But at least Kong let you see Jessica Lange's breasts for a couple of seconds. Nolte is fun to watch, Connelly is decent, Bana is forgettable. The only real notable aspect of the film is the editing. The movie is full of cool tricks, with lots of cool split screen stuff and a couple of interesting morph type things. It's actually really nice, and it's a shame it's not in a better movie.But over all this is just awful, a movie I watched in slack-jawed amazement at its pure awfulness.",Hulk
38,FeastMode,my notes,1,24 July 2019,"Wow. i watched this in theaters and hated it. i almost didn't watch the norton hulk because of how bad this was, but ramsey convinced me that it has nothing to do with that movie and is being completely redone (i LOVE that movie). after rewatching norton, i was just curious about the first one as i remembered nothing about it since i watched it once in theaters. i now see again. wow. hands down the most boring superhero movie of all time. the music selection was so awful and off. i kept asking myself what am i watching. they tried to make it serious and deep, but none of those parts hit. NONE of them. they would just show him looking at flowers and stuff. there are so many wtf and omg moments in this movie. also, it's ridiculously boring. i had to watch it in parts and fast speed for some of the boring scenes. also, lmao, the villain wasn't introduced until 2 hours into this 2:18 movie. excluding the credits, that's with ten minutes left in the movie. it's astonishing. the hulk looked like a cartoon. when the bullets bounced off of him, it was like his skin was soft and flexible like a balloon or something, smh. i have no opinion of eric bana, but he SUCKED. he was so lame, a horrible choice to play this role. the little action there was was useless. mostly running, jumping, shooting, and missing. this movie makes me appreciate the norton hulk and MCU in general. thank you guys (2 viewings)",Hulk
39,Robert_duder,Hmm not as heinous as I remember it the first time but still not Hulk,7,28 June 2008,"What a world of conflict when it comes to discussing Ang Lee's attempted masterpiece Hulk. I remember seeing it in the theater and thinking how incredible terrible the film was and then after seeing the new superior in every way 'The Incredible Hulk' I knew I had to watch this one again for the sake of my readers so I did and somehow I didn't hate it. In fact it wasn't half bad and if it wasn't a movie supposedly about The Hulk it would be even better but Ang Lee tried to swoop in and take liberties with an already established character that fans had expectations for. In fact the entire reason this film is torn to shreds the way that it is is because of director Ang Lee who had no business trying to put a unique artistic flare and style to a comic book hero film and that's my opinion period. His shaky and ridiculous comic book box style narrative is annoying and cheesy and breaks up the little bit of action the exists. The CGI is cheap and the Hulk looks like a cartoon character (although I give them credit for leaving him an aspect of looking a little like his host character played by Bana.) Lee tries to give him this sympathetic human quality but it doesn't work at all. While some of the sequences in the film are nicely filmed (especially the scenes in the desert) it is still a complete mess.Part two major problem is the complete miscasting of the lead role. Eric Bana is ridiculous as Bruce Banner. He has no emotion and he mistakes that looking intense and constipated makes for good drama and it doesn't. While he does have good chemistry with Connelly his character is one you don't give a lick about and find him mostly annoying and glad to see him turn into the Hulk to get him off screen. Jennifer Connelly however is very good as Betty Ross, Bruce's love interest and scientist. She might even be superior to Liv Tyler's Betty Ross in the new version. Connelly is a talented actress and actually shows emotions and makes you feel her character. Also impressive is the performance by Sam Elliott who is most definitely a better performance for General Ross than William Hurt in the new film because I didn't care for Hurt's Ross at all. Connelly and Elliott make a powerhouse supporting cast as far as I'm concerned and perhaps save the film from completely loss. Nick Nolte is also decent enough looking like he always does as Banner's father. He could have been more of a villain to the film but his character never really takes off which is unfortunate because he had a lot of potential. Josh Lucas is a joke as a military agent bent on capturing Banner. He does have some talent too but his performance in this is ridiculous.The case in point is that some film genres don't deserve artistic style (look at Mission Impossible 2---nearly ruined the series) and Ang Lee put far too much intelligent thought into a simplistic action flick. Some of the fight scenes were well done and there is some stunning cinematography but it falls short in really exploring the characters and paying proper homage to the character of the Hulk. I'm not familiar overly with the Hulk back story in the comics but I know that Ang Lee and the other film makers took far too many liberties with a character that people had very high expectations for. Although I think with time...a lot of time...Ang Lee's Hulk will be held to different standards and respected more but it is certainly inferior to the new non stop action fest that is out now (2008) which is the perfect homage to The Incredible Hulk. Still watching the film again I was a little more entertained and still impressed with the good things about it so maybe it's not a total loss. 7 out of 10",Hulk
40,MLDinTN,The Hulk Rocks,8,21 June 2003,"This is definitely one of the better movies you will see.  But, compared to Spiderman, I think the Hulk wasn't as good. What I really liked was the visual style, meaning how Ang Lee used panel screens throughout the movie. I thought it was cool to see the different angles and it was just something different.  The music was good also.And I was surprised at how realistic the Hulk looked in most scenes. But, I didn't care for how he was jumping what looked like miles in the desert. I mean, he is big and heavy, and I just don't see how he could have jumped that high and long.  We even get to see Bruce Banner change into the Hulk and the Hulk becoming Banner again.  The effects looked good for those parts.  The parts with the Hulk in the city were good also. They should have shown more of that. But, I guess that is what the sequel will be for.The first  part of the movie is a lot of background story. I liked it, but I can understand that some may be board with that part. But, I thought it was interesting to learn about Banner's childhood and what went wrong and about the main characters at the lab.Nick Nolte was good as Banner's creepy biological father. He acted well. And I liked how all the characters came together from Bruce's Dad to Betty's Dad and how they even lived at the same desert base.What I didn't like was the lack of a couple of funny lines and the very ending. (SPOILERS): The very ending when Bruce's dad is that monster and he is fighting the hulk in the lake didn't make much sense. They balloon up into this big ball that resembled a jellyfish and then, I guess what was a nuclear bomb was dropped on them. I'm not really sure what happened. Then we just see Bruce floating in the water and it skips to a year later.  Also, I didn't get why they would let Bruce's dad even see him at the end when their goal was to keep Bruce from turning into the Hulk. Also, it didn't make sense how the Hulk and his dad go from that military base out to the desert near a lake by way of a bunch of lightening.   The ending should have been clearer and made more sense.(END OF SPOILERS)FINAL VERDICT:  The visual aspects are the best part of this film. From the way it was edited to the comic book style panels plus the  special effects of the Hulk.  All of it looked good.  It had an intreaging tale with the only draw back being the very ending because it was a little confusing. Definitely a must see summer blockbuster.",Hulk
41,Cineanalyst,Comic-Book Panels,8,13 July 2020,"This is far better than the subsequent and trepid MCU entry, ""The Incredible Hulk"" (2008), and much other superhero fare, simply for some originality and thought being put into the visuals. Such was quite rare for the emerging genre at the turn of the century. Sure, the CGI is dated now, but it's superior to much of the cartoony leaping of figures in ""Daredevil"" (2003), ""Catwoman"" (2004) and even ""Spider-Man"" (2002). I rather like the brightness of the green here, too, which is such a relief from a lot of the needlessly dark--except to cover up CGI cheats and otherwise lack of interest--texture of many of these movies. More importantly, the camera bounds along with the Hulk. Compare that to the static views of characters supposedly gliding and web-slinging in ""Spider-Man."" Most impressive, methinks, though, are the transitions between scenes. ""Hulk"" remains unique to this day in this regard, as director Ang Lee and company experimented by making sequences appear the cinematic equivalent of comic-book panels.It's also interesting that the story is relatively skeptical of American military might so soon for a blockbuster post 9/11 and that there's relatively less smashing than in some other supes burgers (and this despite the Hulk being larger than some other depictions, more like King Kong), but this one does follow the same plot of science-gone-wrong, simplified Jekyll/Hyde anger issues, listless love interest with Betsy, failed military containment by her father, and final confrontation with another monster that comprises ""The Incredible Hulk"" and, to a large extent, many other such movies, so that's not what's important. Perhaps, a bit more psychologizing, with repressed memories, daddy issues and dreams is here, but that's about it. The main distinction is stylistic--the recognition that cinema is a unique visual art form that requires visual adaptation, and that's what ""Hulk"" achieved.The zooming montages through different scenes, the split-screen separation of others, different views of the same characters simultaneously--it's the best attempt I've seen at creating a cinematic comic book. The camera is quite free, too. Shots appear from various angles, often at the same time and of slightly different times. It's as though the spectator, through the camera's eye, were flipping through a comic book where motion pictures replaced the static drawings. Not only a feat of cinematography and editing, either, this, I'm also impressed with the sound design--and even the score--with accompanying such complicated layering of images.",Hulk
42,CuriosityKilledShawn,NOTHING to do with comic-book at all!,1,30 September 2006,"I thought that first Spiderman movie was bad. I thought that Fantastic Four was worse! Well, at least it wasn't an unfathomably long, catatonic snooze-fest. If loaded guns came with the price of admission, I guarantee most of the audience would have used them. They were literally falling asleep, wishing for it to be over. Or for at least SOMETHING, ANYTHING to happen.How can The Hulk be boring? Ask Ang Lee. He's the one responsible for turning a dark and brooding comic-book into one of the biggest disappointments in a summer of big disappointments. Hell, even the TV series managed to portray Bruce (or David - the network thought Bruce sounded too 'gay') Banner as an isolated loner, who has no real place to call home, better than this.It totally disrespects the comic-book, on which it was based, and has mangled Hulk mythology to the point where the title and movie character are the only remotely familiar things. Any fan of The Incredible Hulk will know that current story lines are highly intelligent with deep character development. Nothing of that sort is present here. This would have been bearable if the dialogue, or characters, were good and the logic behind their actions intriguing.Eric Bana brings nothing to the title role. A better casting choice would have been Bruce Campbell, because Bana emotes zilch. Jennifer Connelly is useless. Nick Nolte isn't used enough. Sam Elliot, for once not playing a cowboy, has nothing to do, either.From a creative point of view, Ang Lee's wretched way of cutting scenes together with split screens, in an effort to mimic the comic-book, is disorientating. It appears that in researching the film, he read a couple of Sixties issues and got inspired. This cheapens and degrades the movie and insults the current style of the comic franchise. Even the photography is dull, with no thought put into composition. In fact, the only time the camera is considered is when the colour green makes a creative appearance.And why is it so tame? The Hulk - called Mister Angry in the movie! - spins a tank and chucks it across the desert. Anyone inside would have been crushed by the G-Force before the Hulk even let go. But what happens? The guy inside climbs out, coughs and wipes the dust off! What is this? The A-Team? This would never have happened in the comic-book. It gets even worse when Apache helicopters crash into the Grand Canyon without blowing up.Oh, and since when did the the green guy do that leaping through the air thing? Leave The Hulk alone. He's angry. And you're not going to like him.",Hulk
43,Bored_Dragon,Too long for what it has to show,6,19 August 2017,"Although it technically is superhero action, Hulk puts a bigger accent on human drama than most of the previous superhero movies. It has really good characterization and its strength lies more in a good story than in special effects. Still, however strong its story is, it is not strong enough to keep attention for two and a half hours, so after a while the film becomes boring. If they would rearrange exactly the same story to fit into an hour and a half I would probably give it solid 8, but this way I simply can not go over6/10",Hulk
44,tabuno,A Great Adult-Comic Movie!!!,8,25 January 2019,"22 June 2003. I really didn't want to go to see The Hulk. The trailers made the bulging looking monster look childish and absurd. But by the time I left the theater, I had great respect for the director Ang Lee for putting the entire comic genre onto a solid adult footing. This comic movie isn't for children especially but more directed towards the adult themes of relationships, science gone awry, about sharp drama with character development and the hidden demons that hide within us. While there were slow, perhaps, even boring moments in the early going, such concerns may have been the change in expectations in the movie.Ang Lee has made a great comic book movie for adults. Like Daredevil, this whole genre has merged with a larger fan base and made it into a serious industry with wide-open possibilities much like 2001: A Space Odyssey did for science fiction. While this movie will definitely rise to the level of Finding Nemo in breaking box office receipts because of its more limited attraction, especially children offending, The Hulk will have broken new ground and make a decent enough profit to justify further exploration into this rich comic genre.",Hulk

47,tomgillespie2002,A convoluted and boring mess,4,12 August 2016,"Back in 2003, before Marvel created their 'Cinematic Universe' and started to explore their more obscure, lesser-known characters, superhero movies were starting to hit their stride. Origin stories such as Bryan Singer's X-Men (2000) and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002), while certainly far from perfect, demonstrated just how fun these movies could be without sacrificing plot or character development for the sake of a set-piece. Ang Lee's Hulk took this idea a tad too far, delving into the psyche of its not-particularly- interesting protagonist and forgetting that this is a movie about a giant green rage-monster who smashes things to pieces.Dr. Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) works with his former girlfriend Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) at the Berkeley Biology Institute, experimenting on cell repair using gamma radiation. Due to a mysterious, traumatic event when he was a child, Banner is haunted by the vague memories he has of his parents, now believed to be dead. Naturally, one of his experiments goes awry and he is exposed to a dangerous level of radiation, which allows him to turn into a big green monster whenever he gets angry. His father David (Nick Nolte) turns up alive to complete the experimentation he was prevented from completing by Betty's father Thaddeus (Sam Elliott), who imprisoned him for 30 years. Learning of David's return and Bruce's new power, Thaddeus will not stop at nothing to take them both down.I remember quite liking Hulk when I first saw it back in the cinema, but watching it again 13 years later, I found it a convoluted, and quite frankly boring, mess. There are a couple of things to admire, such as Lee's attempt to translate the comic to screen with the use of multiple split-screen, but this device is employed too often, and in situations that don't really call for it. Nolte is also enjoyable to watch, as he is let loose to the point where it seems like he has wandered onto the set after a particularly heavy binge. However, the film spends far too much time with a mopey Bruce as he struggles with the memories of the past. When the action finally comes, the special effects just aren't up to scratch, even by 2003's standards, and the climax is a confusing muddle of giant clouds obscured even further by the fact that the picture is too dark to make out what is happening. Hopefully, if Marvel ever make a standalone movie with Mark Ruffalo, they will finally get the character right (fingers crossed for Planet Hulk!).",Hulk

50,Floated2,Slow and dull,2,3 May 2019,"The Hulk (and Bruce Banner) in general is relatively a boring and uninteresting character. And in this film, Eric Bana doesn't portray a great Banner/Hulk as he isn't likable and comes across more as selfish and confused. The overall story of this film is lacking any interest.Many origin stories (about how the character become their superheros) aren't always fresh and they take long for the story to come together. The CGI isn't too great either but it's passable.Another thing which felt forced about this movie is the constant camera cuts, and camera side angles/side swipes effects that tried making it more like a comic book feel. This was very much overused and didn't add much to anything at all.The film as a whole was overly long, dull and at many times boring and predictable. The romance love angle between Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly wasn't convincing either.There wasn't much of a villain here with its plot containing in most part how to get the Hulk to get back to his normal Bruce Banner self. Unlikable leads, slow action, boring predictable storyline and a lengthy runtime create for a disaster of superhero movie.",Hulk
51,poe426,Big Screen tv version...,2,30 July 2003,"There's a term for it: ""re-imagining."" That's short for: ""If you can't beat it, rip it off and put your name on it."" Happens in comics all the time. Now, it's happening on the Big Screen- and the filmmakers seem, more often than not, to be taking their cues from (of ALL places!) television. It is to weep. Most television is so bereft of drama or originality that it is literally mind-numbing: one lapses into a trance-like state; the eyes glaze over and one sits, unseeing, as the mind clouds and darkness seeps into one's immortal soul. Don't take long. I refer you to the first hour or so of this alleged motion picture.Banal? You wouldn't believe... Derivative? Don't get me started. Why, you ask, am I so unsettled by what I've seen? The answer's simple enough: I literally learned to read by having my mother read comic books to me when I was a kid. Loved every panel of it. (She stopped reading to me the day I corrected her.) Stanley Leiber (""Stan Lee"") and Jacob Kurtzberg (""Jack Kirby"") may never be confused with the Great Authors, but they sure as heck knew how to tell a story.THE INCREDIBLE HULK was a staple of my childhood- from the first issue, on. Simple premise, uncluttered and clean, beautifully delineated; unlike this hodgepodge. Oh, the cartoon segments are fantastic, but the ""drama"" falls flat on its freakin' face. Much ado, and all that- the kind of pretentiousness that has seeped into comics for years, now (which are little more than regurgitations of episodic tv storylines).Let's hope that THE MIGHTY THOR stays true to its roots (and is set in Asgard, and not on Earth) and is given the same top-of-the-line treatment as the second entry in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy.",Hulk
52,johnnyboyz,Too long and chock full of little annoying things which frustrate the hell out of you.,5,14 December 2006,"'Hulk' is another film that tries to cash in on the influx of comic adaptations that are being/were made at the time of release. What's also rather interesting is that it was directed by Ang Lee, of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' fame. This is quite the opposite film though; visually, in terms of aesthetics and overall, in terms of quality.When I watched this, it was on a Sunday afternoon and I thought I'd watch it fairly relaxed but the frustration I felt whilst watching this has lead me to say the things I'm going to say.Although I liked the 'nod' to comic books themselves via the split screen and various other transitions contained throughout the beginning, too much of one thing can become rather annoying and this is the case. What's significant is the fact it's the same with the entire film, not just the opening, gimmicky segment of effects. They become distracting, annoying and what it is we're looking at becomes insignificant as the visuals pane away, playing second fiddle to the hypnotic music and the erratic transitions unfolding. Once the film starts, we're lead to believe that Banner (Bana) and Ross (Connelly) have shared some sort of history as the actual film and character relations get the ball rolling but I couldn't see anything between them and in terms of plot and past happenings, we're never really told anything about them until it's too late. In fact, we're about forty-five minutes into the film when we learn something coincidental that happened during their childhoods.What was really frustrating with the film were the montages that occur far too frequently throughout. They consist of experiments and various other things involving chemistry equipment and we're 'treated' with loads of numbers and figures as all this is happening. I thought these felt insignificant and needlessly bulked up the run time. They were slow, went on for too long and really, I was just left asking myself: 'Why am I seeing this?' These little montages happen at various points before the initial incident. This actually brings me onto the occurrence where Banner in exposed to become the Hulk in the first place. It seems to take absolutely ages to arrive and when it does, it's rather disappointing as it just 'happens' and then relies on cheese and a bad script from Connelly's character to hit home a 'I thought I was going to watch you die(!)' quote. The reason this is bad is because we don't yet know if she even cares for him. We don't even know HOW they know one another.When it comes to the detective work of the film, what really made me chuckle is that an age after the initial incident of exposure, the characters only start to suspect something's wrong with Banner (No, really? He was exposed to radiation after all) and begin to foil the problem. They work it out fine which is harmless enough but it's not suspenseful nor that interesting because for the characters, it's a revelation  for us; it's already known knowledge; we've known what the characters are working out and talking about for the last hour and is just pointless confirming. It's like tapping in 2+2 into a calculator; you know what the answer's going to be but you're double checking anyway.With comic book films there's bound to be computer generated images involved and although the CGI isn't too distracting; as it's slick and there's enough of it to keep a consistency going, there are no other good things going for Hulk which keeps it down to a mediocre rating.",Hulk
53,filipemanuelneto,"Without a good plot, and without a main character capable of making us care about.",3,13 April 2020,"There are characters from comic books who seem to be almost incapable of causing sympathy. Hulk is clearly one of them. Despite all the melodrama surrounding the character's life story, at least in this film (I'm not a comic fan to the point of knowing if the character's story is what the film tells us), this character is very chalk and little worked, unable to mess with my emotional side.Basically, Hulk is the monstrous alter-ego of Bruce Banner, the son of a military scientist who made the mistake of doing genetic experiments on himself. It is an adaptation of the old story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, or at least it has immense similarities. Ang Lee, who assures the direction, did a decent job but lacked brightness and was never able to transform Bruce / Hulk into a character we can care about. The story seemed to me not very credible, not very interesting, very focused on the action scenes (as if the whole plot was just a pretext to see a green thug howling while crushing everything he finds) and with a very questionable ending.As for the cast, I believe that Eric Bana did what he could with the material that was given to him but there was no way to shine. Sam Elliott is satisfactory, but unable to go beyond the cliché of the cold general who wants to use the tormented superhero as a weapon of war. Jennifer Connelly is perhaps even worse, as she is quite cold in her romantic feelings and the chemistry with Bana, quite simply, does not happen. Nick Nolte makes a good appearance, but in a character very accessory to the plot and absolutely hateful.Technically, the film seems well done to me. It has a considerable budget and the money was clearly spent on carefully done action scenes, loaded with special effects and good quality CGI. Made to impress, they are the strongest part of the film. The point is that they need a good and firm story to give them the support they need. The photography was very well done, with a good job of filming, editing and post-production. The soundtrack, signed by Danny Elfman, does his job beautifully.As with many other films based on comic books, this film was very well done and well thought out in the technical details but does not have a good story to tell. Without that, there is no film that can resist.",Hulk
54,leplatypus,Beauty and the Beast (dvd),4,6 August 2011,"This green eye couple leaves me very dubious: I like the drive of Ang Lee that makes him into becoming the Hulk stunt for the motion capture. I like his editing with nice split screens or cuts and it's surprising that no directors got the same idea before (or after)him. The sets and bright, simple colors were artistically done. The beginning in the 50's desert base was similar to Indy IV..But wait: Hulk a giant? Hulk against dogs? Bruce's father a madman who wants to kill him? Jenny helps Bruce by throwing him in the clutches of the military? I don't know who wrote the script but he never read some Hulk comics. I thought that Hulk was a curse for Bruce (he doesn't want to transform) and that Hulk is blind rage: here, Hulk is just Bruce in anger and a great help to settle things.Even if the special effect are excellent, I can't understand why Marvel let its icon beaten like this.",Hulk

56,BaronBl00d,I Wouldn't Want to Make You Mad...BUT,3,29 December 2003,"The Renaissance or rebirth of action comic heroes to the silver screen of late has been a very welcomed change by this viewer.  Having not read comic books as a child, I did grow up with the comic book culture:  the television shows, animation shows, toys and figurines, posters, etc... of such dignitaries as Spiderman, the Hulk, the X-Men, Batman, Superman, etc... This being said, I was very familiar with the story of Bruce Banner aka the Incredible Hulk.  What I was not prepared for when I sat down to watch Ang Lee's Hulk was a film almost entirely devoid of the elements that made me enjoy the Hulk when I was younger.  True, Lee might have been much more truthful to the legend of the Hulk than anything I had been previously exposed to, but I don't buy that completely.  Lee made a muddle of a film that has some solid moments, but when the final tally is taken Hulk is nothing more than one long, boring film laden with nothing more than repetitive CGI effects that create no sense of reality nor offer the viewer to have any real feelings for the characters involved.  We don not even see the Hulk for the first 45-50 minutes of the film!  What do we see?  Not much.  Some story-board comic book style scene editing that I am sure Lee thought was revolutionary but instead was aggravating.  Eric Bana, Jennifer Conneley, Sam Elliot(been awhile since I've seen ham cut this thickly in awhile), and Nick Nolte, who by the way looks and acts like he just woke up on the street and was escorted to a soup kitchen, talk about things I am not quite sure they understand.  I understand what Lee was trying to do.  I just don't think he came anywhere to success in offering that theme in an entertaining film.  For me Hulk was a major disappointment and an excrutiating time to see.  The best part of the whole film for me was the last line of the film.  It showed that a more tongue-in-cheek approach might have broadened the appeal of the film such as you see in X-Men and Spiderman.  I might sound a little too harsh with this film.  It does have some good things going for it:  the acting is pretty decent from the principal leads, many of the effects are breath-taking, and Lee's direction at times shows brilliance.  The biggest problem with this film is comparing the end result with what could have been done with it.  Ay, there's the rub!",Hulk
57,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Bad screenplay deprives ""Hulk"" of any emotional punch",4,11 June 2008,"I've never been a big fan of the character The Hulk. He's not a typical superhero in that instead of being a human who has some cool new ability and utilizes it for moral objectives, he's a man with a genetic defect that turns him into a lumbering green giant with a knack for destroying things. But a love of Marvel superhero movies kept me rather open-minded for this one, and indeed, watching this film, Bruce Banner/The Hulk seems like a protagonist with a compelling story to tell about fighting one's inner demons. However, the way this story is told, ""Hulk"" completely fails to fully utilize what makes The Hulk a unique character in the Marvel universe.In short, ""Hulk"" is a botched attempt at an origin story. So get off Ang Lee's back if you think this is bad and tear up the three-man team that wrote this mediocre script for him to work with. While Lee does give a poor depiction of the Hulk that is more gentle giant than mean green killing machine, that's the least of this film's problems. James Schamus (story) and his crew don't create a story that really gets at Bruce Banner's dilemma or even lets us access Bruce's psyche. He feels distant for a protagonist and the connection between Bruce and the Hulk is not smooth. Eric Bana as Banner didn't help. The nerd element of Banner doesn't come across and while I find Bana talented, he was too serious and plain in this film and his emotions came across that way too. Bottom line, I felt little to no pity for him, which is unacceptable in a film of this nature.The dialogue of the script is also pretty subpar, except for Nick Nolte's lines as David Banner, the wackjob scientist that screwed up his son. The lines are a bit direct because they carry too much of the load for moving the plot forward. The beginning, Bruce's suppressed childhood memories, a mystery that sort of unfolds with time, is particularly choppy and the connection between Bruce and the viewer never really gets established. We see no more than flashes really of his past and he goes from a 4 year old to a college student in about 2 minutes. I guess the movie needed to be longer, but it would have been worth it to make us actually care about Bruce. I'm not surprised that Schamus and Co. haven't been behind any of Marvel's highly touted films since then, only the mediocre or worse ones: Fantastic Four, Punisher. In fact, Schamus never got another stint with Marvel. I guess co-writing ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" doesn't guarantee success in the world of superheroes.The next beef to have with the film is the action. Fault both Lee and the writers here. To say there isn't enough is justifiable, but at the same time, I'll take a film with less action if it's giving me some great character drama, which ""Hulk"" obviously doesn't, so the lack of action hurts the film here. The action scenes are brief and Lee simply doesn't mess enough stuff up. The Hulk doesn't really get beat up or end up completely destroying something out of sheer rage. The dog fight scene fits the plot but is tasteless and the rest is kind of anti- climactic. For being in a state of blind rage, Lee doesn't give us a Hulk that is sloppy and destructive. In fact his blue eyes (when they're not green) make him a bit effeminate in ways. (Side note: Bana has brown eyes, way to go)I'll give Lee and the editors credit for the paneling technique used to portray a comic book feel. At times it really makes the movie different and neat, though its use feels rather arbitrary and sometimes pointless. At the beginning it works well but as it gets used more and more it doesn't work as well. I also give credit to Nolte and Connelly as Banner's love interest Betty Ross. Connelly pulls off the soft, sensitive vibe. At least someone cares about Bruce. Lastly, kudos to Danny Elfman as always. I'm a big fan of the vibe the score gives off for this film.This is not one of Marvel's bright spots. They brought in the wrong people for this film and ultimately as much as I could pick it apart, there is just no personality to this film and no emotional connection. The whole film is straight-faced, confusing and forgettable. No surprise 5 years later the franchise is already being reinvented.",Hulk

59,Anonymous_Maxine,An excellent anti-war film laced with Apple computer commercials. We can only hope for sequels!,9,9 July 2003,"Whatever your personal views are about the recent military actions taken by the United States, Hulk makes a strong comment on them, even if only indirectly (and not very indirectly, at that). It's been years since I've seen the original TV show (and I was a kid when I saw it, too), so I don't remember too much about the show beyond the basic appearance of the Hulk in it, which was actually the source of one of my strongest reservations about the new movie. From the previews, I was a little dismayed to see that the Hulk was made so big that he was cartoonish and completely unreal, as though he had been so distorted by modern capabilities of computer effects that his original appeal as the angry side of Bruce Banner was turned into a focus on the technique rather than the result.Needless to say, Hulk is a film that entails massive amounts of special effects, the majority of them fairly impressive, although they still remove any sense of realism from the movie. While it's true that this results in more focus on the technique throughout the entire film on how it was made rather than the results, it is still highly entertaining and it delivers an extremely valuable message, especially in modern American society.As we have seen in countless other films (such as great films like E.T., The Iron Giant, etc.), the first response of the military (and, by extension, adults) to something out of the ordinary is to destroy it as potentially dangerous. In this case, as in the case of The Iron Giant, this is exactly what makes everything worse, and in both films, even direct advice and evidence is completely ignored.As was recently the case with Curious George, our fearless leader, military action is strengthened even when it is seen to be both futile and the fuel of the problem. I love how they attack the Hulk relentlessly even though they are making no progress and simply making everything worse. I love movies that reflect real life, even though they physically resemble it almost not at all.One of my favorite things about the movie is that it is able to deliver such a strong message while being so campy at many times. The movie is peppered with over-acting and cheesy special effects, but in a movie like this, things like that only add to the entertainment value. I had very low expectations for Hulk, but after having seen it I am anxious to add it to my collection when it is released on DVD.There are things, for example, that the Hulk is capable of doing that, when done onscreen, are so unexpected and hilarious that they make you laugh out loud, but it is a testament to the meaning of the movie that you can laugh at something like that Hulk running something like 100 mph and then literally leaping into the atmosphere and landing miles and miles away. He is literally able to RUN away from helicopters so fast that, even though they're airborne, they're unable to keep track of him.
Ang Lee's 2003 version of the Hulk is probably 8-10 times the size of a human man, he is capable of grabbing a full-sized military tank by it's gun barrel and swinging and tossing it like a sack of marbles, and he is all but able to defy gravity, but the movie itself is massively entertaining and delivers a great message about the need to understand the adversary before blindly seeking to blow it up.It is extremely rare for movies these days to be bold enough to make statements like this, and even more rare for these messages to be delivered in such creative and clever packages (Bruce Almighty is also a recent example of a film like this). Lee may have stepped down in seriousness from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but definitely not in quality. I can't say that I would rank Hulk with Crouching Tiger, but it is definitely a movie that contains more than you might expect. Watch it, enjoy it and appreciate it, decipher the message and take it for what you will, try to resist the urge to run out and buy an iMac, and with all the special effects and CGI, can we please get someone from make-up over here to do something about Sam Elliott's mustache??",Hulk
60,FiendishDramaturgy,So much potential; so little value...,2,27 November 2003,"This is a prime example of what not to do with CGI. I found the movie itself to be very good; entertaining, well written, inspiringly directed, professionally portrayed, and creatively conceived. But the CGI Hulk monster killed the entire production, for me.This brings us back to the already old issue of CGI and its place in the industry.When dealing with multitudes, such as the goblin/Orc armies in LoTR, or the Army of Anubis in The Mummy Returns, CGI is wonderful. It enhances a good story and generates millions of members of a group, creates magical places, gives excellent lighting effects, etc. When dealing with a single character such as the Scorpion King in The Mummy Returns, or the Hulk...CGI alone is not an adequate execution...obviously. LOOK at the finished product. Do either of these characters look ... real? No, they do not. Makeup effects will be a lost art by the end of this century, and is so under-used now with the ""perfection"" of CGI, that the industry is almost solely relying on this medium. That, in my humble opinion, is a horrendous mistake. Look at Karloff's Frankenstein's monster, and then look at the computer generated Scorpion King. What you see is the difference between a quality make up artist and a really bad rendition of a would-be god. The Hulk, to me, appeared to be only one step above the claymation creations of the early eighties. That is NOT a good thing, if you ask me.The story? What story? It was lost in the shadow of the horrid computer effects and ill-conceived generation of what was once an icon in the field of comic book heroes.All in all, this movie was horrible. What it could have been fades in the light of what it is...terrible computer generated monster, which overshadows anything else this movie contained.

He's always just sort of there. Always ready to be surpassed.In other words, the movie suffered from bad casting. Jennifer Connelly, really, love her to death, but she has as many issues emoting as Kristen Stewart and throwing her into a role like this is asking for her to phone it in.So the film suffered.And then the plot itself...well, if you read comics, you come in expecting to see the Hulk jump around in a blind rage and destroy things...and you got that in spades. In respect to the source material, it wasn't really that bad.The problem here is the casting. In the Hulk you expect a lot of mindless carnage and destruction so in movies about the Hulk, you need actors that can breathe real life into the action. You just don't have that here.",Hulk
62,freemantle_uk,The Art-house Superhero Film,6,22 June 2008,"This film is okay, but should have been a lot better. This film tackles the origins of the Hulk and focuses on Bruce Banner's relationship with his birth father and his obsession for power. This film is a bold attempt, trying to be dark, serious and psychological and looks at issues such as child abuse and emotional problems.The Hulk starts in the 1960s on an American Army Base in the middle of the desert. David Banner was experienting on gamma radiation and its uses to healing tissue. He was unable to get to experiment on humans so does it on himself. His son Bruce inherits these abilities from his father and David Banner starts to experiment on his son. The film then fast forwards where Bruce also starts to experiment with Gamma Radiation with Betty Ross. During an accident Bruce becomes the Hulk and he is captured by the army, under the command of General Ross. However, the Hulk escapes and runs amok in the desert before heading off to San Francisco, looking for Betty. The army also captured David Banner and he starts to develop powers himself, and is able to absorb matter and use it, such as rock, water and electricity. He also experiment on gamma radiation on animals, mainly dogs.What the film does write is that it is psychological and tries to be deep. The characters are also well developed. It is a bold film. However this film has faults. It strays away from the comic book source material, which I didn't like. The film is too long, its around an two and half hours and a film like this should really no more then two hours. The villain of film was also not good, because it was David Banner who had superpowers. I didn't think it worked and that final battle between the two was disappointing. The Hulk needs villains like the Abomination and the Leader and General Ross. In this film General Ross was portrayed as a man who was doing his duty (which wasn't a bad thing). The CGI for the Hulk wasn't too good either. He has been called angry Shrek, but I saw him as a big bright green blob with a sad face, not angry. It also took too long to see the Hulk, it took 40 minutes. I personally didn't like the comic book style of shooting the film. It distracted from the action in the film and was really all just style. I didn't think it worked. Ang Lee was also not the right sort director for this film. Ang Lee is a very good director, but he is not a good action director and needs independents from the studio. He is better doing more independent style films.I personally preferred the new version to this version.",Hulk

The story is about small out of control angry men against the giant Hulk. If this is the state of our humanity, we're in BIG trouble. But if a movie exist that portrays such society, then some parts of it must be a reflection our psyche. Casting is bad which doesn't reflect the character of the people of the story and there're too many characters that are thrown in that doesn't help make the story better. The only two characters that works is Eric Banna and Jennifer Connery. Sam Elliot is a good actor and great as a cow boy, but just doesn't work as a believable army four star general. The original Marvel's Hulk plot had enough interesting characters to make the movie work without having to throw in Bruce Banner's father to bootstrap the story, or make major Talbot into a scum bag military industrialist. c'mon guys, work on the strength of the original characters and stop twisting the characters around so that you just succeeded in making the story poorer. There's a whole slew of Hulk nemesis that could have been brought in and still made the movie great instead of a having a character like freak dad Banner. The best scene in this movie asides from animated Hulk (which was bit spotty as well - weired because it had the face of an adolescent boy stretched into Hulk's face) was in the end where a guerrilla South American commando raids into Bruce Banner's medic camp and makes him angry.

64,dee.reid,Another Marvel hit,9,21 June 2003,"""Hulk"" is the 2003 adaptation of the popular Marvel Comics character about a geneticist named Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) who transforms into a giant, green beast when stressed.  This ability (or curse?) naturally makes him a threat to the army, who chase him across the desert and into San Francisco in the films biggest action sequence.  Yet, Banner's traumas have not gone unnoticed, especially in the eyes of Betty Ross (Academy Award-Winner, Jennifer Connelly), Bruce's close friend.  This is certainly a great film with some impressive special effects.  There was some debate over whether or not the CGI Hulk would be convincing on screen and I think it is.  Eric Bana, who is relatively unknown and whose only previous film credit is Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"", puts on the films best performance, despite his somewhat limited presence on screen. 
I've never paid that much attention to the Incredible Hulk, most likely because he was never one of my favorite Marvel characters.  I have always been a Spider-Man and X-Men fan.  Even so, I did thoroughly enjoy myself watching this.  Though ""Hulk"" is rated ""PG-13"", I really would not recommend letting little kids see it, because it is quite disturbing in some parts, especially when the Hulk battles a quartet of mutant dogs.9/10",Hulk
65,MaxBorg89,"Strong drama, struggling CGI",8,30 January 2006,"Of the three Marvel Comics adaptations released in 2003 (Daredevil, X2 and Hulk), a lot of comic-book aficionados considered the Green Giant's big screen counterpart the weakest. I have to say I liked all three movies, particularly X2, which was flawless, and while Hulk has a few defects, I think it's a quite satisfying film.Everyone knows the story: Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a scientist who, after being exposed to radiations, turns into a big, green brute as soon as he gets angry. With only his ex (Jennifer Connelly) willing to help him, Bruce has two enemies to face: one is the lady's father, general Ross (Sam Elliot), who wants to make our green friend harmless at any cost; the other one is Bruce's own dad (Nick Nolte), who he thought to be dead. Unfortunately, he's alive, and he wants to use his son for his own purposes.The story, loosely based on Peter David's ""psychological"" run of the comic-book, is one of the best ever written for a big screen version of Marvel's characters. The only ""problem"" (as with X-Men, for example) is that the movie looks and ends like the pilot episode of a TV show. It's like a long trailer, where the characters are introduced and the relationships between them established, leaving the real action in the corner while waiting for an eventual sequel.On a technical level, I appreciated Ang Lee's way of bringing the comic-book to the screen, particularly the use of split-screen to make some sequences more dramatic. Danny Elfman's music is very good too, as could be expected considering his work on Batman and Spider-Man. However, these merits can't entirely make up for the movie's major disappointment, namely the CGI Hulk himself: he looks great in the close-ups, whereas in any other shot it's like looking at a video-game character (especially in the long sequence where he's running through the canyons).Luckily, Banner's personal drama works anyway, thanks to great writing and very good acting: Bana and Connelly are impressive as the leading couple, and Elliot is superb. Best of the bunch is Nick Nolte: his portrayal of a revolting man who has no interest in his own son, unless he can get some kind of profit out of him, is perhaps the best work of his career. Also worth checking out are cameos by Stan Lee and former TV Hulk Lou Ferrigno.Final verdict: as solid as other Marvel adaptations, but could have benefited from better effects work. I mean, even Ferrigno's green make-up from the '70s looks like great art next to some of the CG shots.",Hulk
66,barnabyrudge,Disappointing screen treatment of the Marvel comic-book favourite  it never seems to decide what approach to take or who its target audience should be.,5,16 February 2007,"It would be wrong to call ""Hulk"" a super-hero movie. By definition, super-heroes have extraordinary powers. but they usually put them to good use, e.g. hunting criminals or saving the world. The Hulk is actually a monster, a threat to mankind, so strictly speaking this version of ""Hulk"" is actually a monster movie, more akin to the likes of ""King Kong"" and ""Godzilla"". Director Ang Lee is a very versatile film-maker  his oeuvre includes period costumer ""Sense And Sensibility"", family drama ""The Ice Storm"", western epic ""Ride With The Devil"" and martial arts opus ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". But he comes unstuck with this attempted comic book adaptation because his intelligent style is too ambitious for the genre. Ultimately, ""Hulk"" lacks the gung-ho energy craved by the popcorn generation, but also fails to pursue its artistically complex theme of identity and ""the inner demon"" to its logical conclusion. The result is a film which falls into no man's land  those looking for a more mature, thoughtful approach will hate the action-packed second half, while those looking for outrageous action and destructive set pieces will hate the heavy-going first half.Dr David Banner (Paul Kersey) works on a remote desert nuclear base and is trying to find a way of regenerating deteriorating human bodies. Part of his research involves experimenting upon himself. When his wife gives birth to a baby boy named Bruce, David is interested to find out if any of his genetic changes have been inherited by the child. But his observations are cut short when his research programme is terminated  in a fit of rage, he sets off a deliberate explosion at the base and ends up killing his wife during an argument shortly afterwards. Young Bruce grows up in an adopted family, never knowing what happened to his birth parents nor that he may be carrying abnormal genes as a result of his father's work. Many years later, grown up Bruce (Eric Bana) is working at a scientific institution when he accidentally gets zapped by a powerful gamma ray. Rather than killing him as it should, the gamma ray merely unlocks the abnormalities inside him. His real father (Nick Nolte, as the older Dr David) turns up and hints at the freakish powers Bruce possesses. Sure enough, a while later Bruce gets angry about something and finds himself turning into a gigantic green monster with incredible strength and agility. When Bruce's work colleague and ex-girlfriend, Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly), discovers that he has this fierce alter ego she is desperate to help him. But the military are keen to capture Bruce whilst he is in his hulk state so that they can take samples from him for research purposes. This only makes him angrier than ever, whereupon he escapes the research laboratory and goes on a destructive rampage.By far the best thing that Lee has done in the film is his virtuoso use of split screen imagery. There are times when the screen actually resembles a page in a comic book, with picture boxes all over the place showing different angles, points of views and character reactions. It is a fascinating technique, skilfully used. But in most other aspects ""Hulk"" is a disappointing film. Only Nolte seems to create the correct acting style for the kind of film he's in  Bana is too moody, Connelly too serious, and Sam Elliott comes across as a stereotypical caricature as an army general. The special effects are less impressive than expected. Yes, the destruction of streets and vehicles is convincing enough during the San Francisco sequence  but the Hulk itself is a horribly fake-looking creature, more reminiscent of Shrek than the comic creation of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Considering Lee's reputation and the rich cinematic potential of the original comic books, ""Hulk"" emerges as rather a let-down.",Hulk
67,lukem-52760,"THE BEST VERSION OF THE ""HULK"" EVER & IN AN EMOTIONAL,SERIOUS,TRAGIC MARVEL CLASSIC!!!",8,6 October 2019,"The BRILLIANT Director ""Ang Lee"" made a visually stunning, serious & Tragic very ""Adult"" Marvel hero film way back in 2003 but it never got the recognition he deserved, it's an underrated CLASSIC.Eric Bana is an excellent actor & totally fitted the part of troubled scientist ""David Banner"" he took the role serious & gave a powerful & often emotional performance, to me he is still the best actor we've had to play the role of ""David Banner"" & yes he's still better than now ""MCU"" version, yes i really like ""Mark Ruffalo"" but ""Bana"" is way better & not as comical & i like ""Ang Lee's"" c.g.i version of the ""Hulk"" still better, i prefer his look & his darker green colour he holds up & looks fantastic still!!!
Also the cast is excellent, from the great gruff veteran actor ""Nick Nolte"" who is so good in his evil psychotic role as Bana's crazy father to another old school veteran star ""Sam Elliott"" to the beautiful ""Jennifer Connelly"" this has a great cast of excellent talent.
The movie plays out like a serious Dramatic Thriller with some fantasy elements, ""Ang Lee"" directed this as a serious work of art & it shows, nearly every scene is shot beautifully, he also plays much more on the tragedy of the character & his dark origin story,
Bruce Banner is a troubled man who has seen something horrific as a small boy & along with some evil scientific abuse from his psycho father, he becomes a beast.
I have always loved this comic book movie since it first came out & stand by it & defend it as i do with the excellent & underrated ""Daredevil"" & ""The Punisher"" all early 2000's Marvel films that most people don't seem to like? But i have always loved all 3 films & in my opinion are still the best ""Marvel"" before the ""MCU"" was properly set-up.The performance from ""Eric Bana"" is excellent & he really dives into the drama & remains my favourite ""Banner/Hulk"" he's excellent.
""Hulk"" is an excellent serious take on a classic Marvel character by a brilliant masterful Director. Enjoy a real ""Adult"" superhero film",Hulk
68,noralee,Good Actors Drown in Ridiculous Effects and Lousy Script,2,19 December 2005,"There was a lot of rationalization about comic book fandom when it was announced that Ang Lee, with an expertise primarily in exquisite family films chose to direct ""Hulk."" He chose excellent actors who strive for realistic emoting, and the family interactions, as uniquely dysfunctional as they are, were the most interesting to me -- though many in the audience kept shouting out during the exposition ""Bring on the Hulk already!"" A good portion of the plot is even told during the opening credits to try and get as much out of the way for such restless viewers as possible. Those folks seemed to like it when the Hulk finally does appear, but I thought its bounding CGI ridiculousness blew-up more than the furniture.Three authors are credited for the screenplay, but I think that's probably just because that's the Writer's Guild maximum as this feels like the horse that was written by committee and turned out a camel, with almost desperate repeat references to King Kong. No one could actually say ""T'was beauty killed the beast."" so they could leave open the possibility of a sequel. The flashback memories and contemporary confrontations with father Nick Nolte were interesting motivators, especially for the mostly non-verbal Hulk.Funny how my reactions to the use of the military against the Hulk and his crushing of tanks and planes have gotten more complex since the current war as I now think of the young soldiers following orders who are inside, even if they are CGI too. I guess the Hulk should now be considered a WMD.(originally written 6/22/2003)",Hulk
69,Agent10,"Please, let there be no sequels",1,26 June 2003,"As if they needed yet another comic book turned into a movie, The Hulk sauntered into theatres. And despite the crummy special effects, the slow and listless dialogue, and a running time that seemed far too long and pretentious for a movie like this, it still opened with a bang. Let's hope it doesn't last. But what actually made this movie so bad? If it wasn't for the overwhelming marketing blitz that subconsciously motivated you to watch this film, then obviously the curiosity of a CGI Hulk intrigued you. Sadly, it would have been better with a guy painted green than a CGI cartoon character. I thought I was watching a Pixar movie, not some live action film. Even that last comment was degrading for Pixar. And of course, the big bad government seemed too cartoonish and overused to make it a believable enemy. Let's face it, this movie was nothing more than some overblown episode of some dull and repetitive anime that happened to include live action elements and wooden acting.

70,TheFearmakers,Before Marvel Films Were 95% Comedy,8,5 June 2018,"The early days of modern cinema Marvel when there were no constant one-liners ala Tony Starkasm... Yes, Robert Downey Jr. is funny but soon enough, every damn superhero had to share in his constantly glib persona. Even the recent Star Wars movies use it. Lighten up all the lighting up already... Let's get back to basics...HULK, the first big screen solo effort, is underrated and pretty good in several ways, taking forty-two minutes until Eric Bana, as scientist Bruce Banner... with the inevitable rage built-in from birth... turns into what Sam Elliott's tough General calls ""The Big Man."" Taking so much time for the payoff might seem crazy to some, but even KING KONG waited forty-eight minutes to reveal that titular beast. The reason for this is... Suspense...Thankfully, until the long-drawn climax pitting the military verses a sunny desert leaping Hulk (backed by Danny Elfman's worst score), he's kept mostly in the dark, outside, or within softly-lit interiors: like the laboratory he breaks out of to start the ball rolling. While the side-characters, including ingenue Jennifer Connelly and smarmy villain Josh Lucas, aren't altogether fleshed-out, Bana plays Banner interestingly enough so the transformations matter. Also let it be noted that he and Mark Ruffalo (AVENGERS) share a slight swarthy resemblance to the only human to play the creature: the iconic Lou Ferrigno... Unlike this poorly received blockbuster's poorly received reboot, THE INCREDIBLE HULK, in which brooding and melancholy Edward Norton attempts to lean more towards the TV series that even includes The Lonely Man piano theme, there's a villain-behind-the-villain here, usurping the nefarious Military so not to be one-dimensional, common, and downright predictable...Enter the always-gruff Nick Nolte, raspier than ever as Bruce's mad-scientist father, David. That's right, David Banner... taken from Bill Bixby's television turn since the show's developer, Kenneth Johnson, found the original name's alliteration too corny. And sure, this HULK gets a bit sappy and melodramatic at times, especially during flashbacks. But it doesn't let enough of that same downtime stagnate (albeit overusing initially cool but eventually distracting multi-screens) to make one forget what/who the movie's really about: There's an omnipresent vibe that that Special Something is right around the corner. And it wasn't a joke back then. (cultfilmfreaks.com)",Hulk

72,rosscinema,Entertaining film with good story,7,29 June 2003,"The best thing about ""Hulk"" is not the special effects but the story behind all of it. The story is about a scientist named Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) who doesn't remember his parents but in flashback sequences we see that his father worked with DNA for the government and injected himself with an experimental drug and later he gets his wife pregnant so the effects of the drug are passed on to his baby boy. Banner works with a woman named Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) and they were almost lovers at one time but he has always remained distant. Betty's father is General Ross (Sam Elliott) and he is responsible for getting Bruces father locked up for 30 years and Betty has maintained a distant relationship with her father. One day an accident occurs in the lab and Bruce is exposed to gamma rays and this activates the drug that he was born with in his system. One night a man shows up (Nick Nolte) and he announces that he is Bruce's father. Bruce has been harboring repressed emotions all his life and his anger finally unleashes the Hulk. The film is directed by Ang Lee who is known for thought provoking dramas and he aims the focus of the film in the right direction with the characters repressed thoughts and emotions. Its interesting that both Bruce and Betty have bad relationships with their parents so we can believe that they have a common bond. Nolte gives the best performance in the film as the brilliant but psychotic scientist who doesn't think twice about using his own son as a guinea pig for his experiments. His performance gives the film just the right amount of pathos to make this more than just an action film. There is real depth to his ravaged eyes and features. The Hulk itself is where the film is in real question. The shots of him at night or in close-ups are where he is most effective looking but when he is running about and battling the military than the film loses some conviction. It is fun to watch, don't think I wasn't entertained. But these scenes are just not convincing and it shows that we still have a long way to go with computer graphics as special effects. At times during the film I thought I was watching an animated feature! For you trivia fans the creator of Hulk Stan Lee and actor Lou Ferrigno appear as security guards. I did enjoy Hulk but its far from convincing. Remember how convincing the dinosaurs were in ""Jurassic Park""? This is nowhere near that. As far as comic books turned into films is concerned the best is still Superman 1 and 2, Batman 1 and 2, Spiderman and probably the first X-men film. This would fall right behind those and its clearly better than misfires like ""The Phantom"" and ""Daredevil"" and ""The Shadow"". The focus of the story with the characters and Nolte's performance are the best things about the film but even with unconvincing graphics this is still a lot of fun to watch.",Hulk

74,lemon_magic,"Problematic adaptation, but has its moments",7,1 May 2005,"In spite of the ""Psychology 101"" characterization and subconscious motivations of Banner and his father, and in spite of the problems with consistency and pacing, ""The Hulk"" emerges as a movie with a distinctly different tone and atmosphere than most of the other crop of ""superhero"" themed movies. Other superhero movies have been more intriguing or entertaining. But anyone who likes superhero themed movies should check this one out, if only to see how a talented director like Lee handles action and characterization.The actors are terrific. As I said above, the emotional core of the movie is completely unoriginal and the plot relies on the old clichés of repressed memories and Jeckyll-Hyde transformations to drive the movie. But the actors take these overly-familiar ideas and make them work. For instance, it takes a hell of an actor to deliver Boris Karloff lines such as those given to Kris Kristofferson as the mad scientist - the fact that I was able to listen to his speeches without cracking up with laughter is a tribute to his ability to focus the character. Even when the director has to resort to a flashback with a Kristofferson voice over for a key emotional moment in the plot, Kris makes it work.And Sam Elliot brings so much to the role of General Ross, that his performance was the factor that made me decide that I was going to like this film. Yes, the character is a complete cliché, but Elliot invests Ross with so much gravitas, dignity and strength that any scene he is in gets kicked up several notches even when there is no SFX mayhem on screen.Alas, part of what keeps Hulk from scoring higher is the CGI SFX of the Hulk himself. I know they spent skillions of dollars modeling and animating the character, but most of the time, it doesn't work. The Hulk has convincing weight and heft, the animators do a pretty good job of having him interact with the environment, and most of the time they even get the articulation of his shoulder joints right (unlike many CGI fests)...but his color and texture and the way lighting reflects off his skin are off. Worst of all the proportions of his body simply defy the eye's ability to accept them - they're TOO 'comic booky' in an environment full of 'real' objects. This faults are especially blatant in scenes where there are 'live' humans in the shot for comparison. The CGI jars the eye and keeps irritating the viewer, because it's not abstract enough to let the viewer relax and let his subconscious fill in the gaps.However, I still recognize that it's a magnificent effort, and the 20-30% of the movie where it DOES work make the movie worth the effort. So let's talk about that 20-30%.Not the big 'Dog Fight' with the gamma-powered attack poodle. (Although I think I see a humorous tribute to one of the Hulk's earlier illustrators in here - I think this exactly how Dale McKeown would draw those dogs). And not the showdown at the end where Banner's father has become a version of ""the Absorbing Man"" (a classic Marvel comics villain from the 60's and 70's). I'm thinking of the running battle between the Hulk and the Armed Forces which ranges from the desert base where the Hulk escapes to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.This action sequence is where Ang Lee's sensibilities as a director serve him well. For nearly 15 minutes, the screen is a lyrical dance of speed, flight, and power. It's like a montage of soaring ballistic leaps, gamma powered muscles, armor, explosions, shrapnel, bullets, missiles, fighter jets, helicopters, terse military battle chatter, exclamations of disbelief, and hoarse yells for help. Most effectively, there are short pauses in the action while the military tries to catch up with the Hulk yet again. This keeps the film from falling prey to an overloaded MTV style of directing and keeps the film from bludgeoning the viewer's patience. And the CGI of the Hulk works extremely well with the harsh militaristic lines and textures of high powered war machines. It's one of the coolest SFX things I've ever seen in the movies, and I don't think anyone but Lee could have done it.So...the movie is flawed in its attempts to sandwich a psychodrama onto a movie about a character of boundless might and rage, and not quite up to its ambitions to create a believable half ton, 12 foot human behemoth. But you get to watch the Hulk throw a tank turret over a mountain range, knock down a helicopter by spitting a missile warhead at it, and fall 20,000 feet into the ocean. And the actors invest the characters with depth and dignity. If you like this kind of thing at all, if you are any kind of Fan Boy, I think you'll enjoy 'the Hulk'.",Hulk
75,Rob_Taylor,I think the Hulk wrote the script....,5,28 June 2003,"Yes, another comic book adaptation with promise bites the dust. If you sit through the 40 mins (yes....40!) before the Hulk makes an appearance and don't wonder when they are going to get on with it then you are endowed with more patience than 90% of the audience I saw it with.The overuse of split screen images, designed to evoke the comic book feel, is grating. You can do this with comics because the image isn't going to change. With movies you have a pitifully small time to take it all in and you end up looking from pane to pane and miss the critical bits.The music is hideously inappropriate - some kind of oriental sounding nonsense that just jars you in many places.And as for the ending....what in Hell is supposed to have happened to the Hulk's father? Can anyone give a definitive answer?It's adaptations like this that make people snigger at comic book and graphic novel collectors, when the fault clearly lies with the film-makers here.That said, the scenes with the Hulk are OK, if a little stupid in places, such as with the tanks. The Hulk looks poorly CGI'd, but I put that down to wanting the comic book look. But it still looks about as real as Roger Rabbit, in some areas. You can either have reality, or cartoonish-ness. Mixing them doesn't work real well. Perhaps if they'd made more use of primary colours, a la Dick Tracy, it would have looked better.Ultimately, a poor film that drags on and on.",Hulk

77,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,Astonishing and Very Underrated,8,27 January 2005,"Ang Lee's adaptation of ""Hulk"" is an amazing achievement in visual storytelling, cinematography, and computer generated effects. While the substance attributed to the story may not go as deep as other comic-book films such as ""Spider-Man"", it attempts to dabble in the matters of relationships and love, and how they effect us in life.Bruce Banner is exposed to a dose of Gamma Radiation in a lab accident, awakening a strain of abnormal genetic material he inherited from his father; himself a scientist searching for the key to rapid healing and immunity processes. Acting as a sort of controlled cancer, when Bruce is overcome with emotion, his body transforms, and he becomes the Hulk, a giant green monster, created skillfully by Industrial Light and Magic. Many people have complained of the quality of the computer effects, particularly with the Hulk himself, but I certainly felt these were some of the best computer generated images I have ever seen. There are several shots that I could have sworn were real.In terms of content, as mentioned before, the film plays on family and relationships as lovers and friends, to show how they impact us on a personal level, though made larger than life because of the Hulk's problem. Ultimately, I feel Ang Lee was searching for a deeper, more provocative meaning in the film, but the limitations of the plot kept him from taking it as far as it could go. Overall, I feel the visual storytelling in the Hulk, with the delightful ""comic-book"" performances by the cast, make it a must-see film for fans of action and suspense.",Hulk

80,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,The Incredible Sulk!,3,19 September 2017,"This is an embarrassment to one of Marvel's best superheroes and it makes it seem that 'it's not easy being green' especially considering that the film didn't bring much green at the box office. The film is a comic book movie that's WAY too literal in its editing (though it is a nice style in an otherwise sloppily paced movie) and even then the movie is BORING! For a film that has the word HULK in the title, it's very unfortunate that the film's name is totally out of place considering the story is basically a slow-paced and Hulk-lite story.As a fan of the Hulk character, this film didn't really want to focus on its title character; instead it wants to be Bruce Banner, a sooky and whiny insult to the character's alter-ego.For 2003 it's technically impressive and well-done multi-million dollar filmmaking, but today it's a bad egg that has collective nostalgia for some, but others not so much.

81,dunmore_ego,Shrek On Steroids,6,18 December 2004,"Despite the disconcerting fact that the Hulk does in fact look like a juiced Shrek, this is not as bad a film as its detractors would have us believe. With the masterful Ang Lee in the director's chair, the blame for this production's lack of luster must surely be placed on the shoulders of others more acquainted with mediocrity. Who better to absorb such barbs than two of the semi-conscious principals, the phonetic Eric Bana (as Dr. Bruce Banner, the unfortunate scientist bombarded with gamma rays who morphs into our beloved green muscle-blob) and the sensual-yet-wooden Jennifer Connelly? Lee uses inventive filmic devices (such as inserting ""comic book"" frames moving about the picture screen, or creating establishing shots by panning outwards from the smallest subject of the scene, rather than the other way 'round) to craft a movie which progresses visually almost like reading a comic book. Yet for all his cinematic inventiveness, there is only so much Lee can do with his human charges, who mope about the screen like they're unaware that the director has called ""Action!"" This is surely one of those movies which does not grasp our interest until the Feature Creature - the eponymous Hulk - is upon us And we all know what happens when Bruce Banner gets enraged: his body turns green and his pants turn purple and very, VERY elastic. Even his *socks* cannot withstand the Hulk's growth, snapping into shreds in homeopathic fury; pan up and sho 'nuff: purple pants tighter than the Beatles trousers.Speaking of straining threads, Lou Ferrigno (TV's Incredible Hulk) appears in a cameo, as a security guard in a shirt 5 sizes too small, walking beside none other than Stan Lee (the Hulk's co-creator), playing a security chief.As with Spiderman's new filmic incarnation, that which caused the Hulk's condition has been updated from ""radiation"" to ""genetic engineering gone awry"". In the 50's and 60's the big thunder was ""radiation""  practically everything, when exposed to Big Bad Radiation turned into something which either wanted to kill people or save people (rats, men, plants, insects  nothing and no one was spared being exposed to Radiation to drive some puny plot down B-Movie Lane)  and ever so gradually, movies of our modern era have all come to rely on another repetitive plot device  Big Bold Genetics  only doing so because, as with Radiation, First World Science once again believes it has identified one of the seminal forces of nature. We believe ourselves truly to be scientific colossi  yet ""Friends"" closed out ten seasons on network television recently to grandiose acclaim.Despite the derision aimed at the Hulk's CGI image, let's face it, people of earth - this is as good as it gets in 2003. The creation of this Hulk character is quite incredible!: a non-real, two-dimensional image that for all intents and purposes, is *as real* as it needs to be within its film medium; interacting and completely three-dimensionally at peace with its surroundings and the human characters it physically relates to. As ""sophisticated"" as we all think we are in this age of Gollum and Yoda Episode 2, I defy anyone to point out major discrepancies involving shadows, weight distribution, action arcs or moving musculature  this image interacts with smoke, water, trees, sand, exploding debris  it's quite astounding to watch if you allow your suspension of disbelief to over-ride the elitist desire to prove how ""smart"" you are. In truth, it's more ""realistic"" watching the Hulk's movements than any of the wire-fights in ""Crouching Tiger"", ""Charlie's Angels"", ""Daredevil"" or ""Kill Bill"", which are infuriating purely because the supposed ""real-life"" characters arc through the air ""unrealistically""  i.e. they change direction, hover, or are simply edited sloppily, where we see the arc of their flight interrupted by the tug of the wires they so obviously are wearing.There is also much pathos in the Hulk's facial features; more than could be summoned by his girl-toy Jennifer Connelly, whose doe-eyed pining couldn't hold a candle to the Hulk's Oscar-worthy palette of emotion  and neither could the Hulk's human counterpart, the puppet-faced Eric Bana. Instead of Nick Nolte (who played Bana's certifiably insane father more than satisfactorily), I was expecting GEPPETTO to appear, hoping that his son would become a Real Boy one day and able to move his facial muscles. Though they are merely ones and zeros, it is disconcerting to realize that the ""cartoon"" characters of this generation (the computer blips, such as Buzz Lightyear, Nemo, Gollum, Sulley & Monsters, Inc., Mr. Incredible, The Hulk, etc.) display a depth of acting talent that cannot be surpassed were they to be replaced by human thespians in those same roles.It is for Ang Lee to weep. It is for George Lucas to rejoice.Saving the best Bruce Banner one-liner (from ""The Incredible Hulk"" TV series) as the last line of movie dialog was an inspired in-joke  and then for Eric Bana to say it in Spanish! ""You're making me angry  you wouldn't like me when I'm angry"".Yes, but first let's learn how to PLAY angry, shall we Eric?...(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.thedunmore.com/POFFY-MovieReviews.html)",Hulk

83,pyrocitor,Tries too hard to be something it's not,6,22 November 2004,"Spoilers hereinAt this moment, Hollywood producers are very likely sensing a flaw in their logic. 'OK, so X-Men and Spider-Man did really well at the box office, and were both critically acclaimed. We can now greenlight a whole bunch of superhero movies at once and have them all make us lots and lots of money.' Well, this may perhaps have worked in the money department, but it can sure ruin the quality of a film. Hulk seems to be the perfect example...The problem very likely lies in director Ang Lee's foresight that to get Hulk to be taken seriously, he would have to try to break away from the standard superhero formula. So he tries to present us with a harrowing drama touching on man's inner beast. The problem is though, no matter how many dramatic themes are thrown in, Hulk is still a comic book movie. The main gist of the film consists of a big, green muscular guy jumping around and smashing stuff. So the actual character of the Hulk seems out of place in his namesake movie, just because, as Kermitt so very well put it, 'It's not easy being green'. Especially in a film which keeps repetitively trying and mostly failing to be a serious drama.Director Ang Lee also takes the term 'comic book movie' far too literally, and keeps splitting the scene into four parts to resemble comic book panels, which initially seemed like a cool idea, but it is nearly impossible to watch four screens at one, so in the end, the technique just doesn't work. Don't get me wrong - I have great respect for Ang Lee after Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Ice Storm, but he seemed like the wrong choice to direct Hulk, just because it's probably too mainstream for him. In fact, in Hulk, Lee does his best work in front of the camera for a change, providing the motion capture for the Hulk himself, to great effect. Hulk moves very well, despite looking quite ridiculous due to painfully awful CGI effects making him look like he was fashioned out of plasticine. It's a shame that the Hulk has to look so awful, since his movement is so terrific - it's like having a professional race car driver ride a tricycle.A couple of decent performances turn up in Hulk, but nothing worth mentioning in the whole of the actors careers - all have done better performances than in Hulk, except for Josh Lucas, who steals the show by playing against type as the truly villainous Major Talbot. Talbot is so incessantly evil that you can't help but hate him, or cheer whenever Hulk is given a chance to toss him through the nearest wall. (or finally kill him by deflecting a tossed grenade right back at Talbot who thew it, a very poignant case of just desserts)Eric Bana also gives a strong performance as Bruce Banner, the troubled scientist with seething inner emotions, which utterly release themselves as everyone's favorite green monster. Jennifer Connelly is another strong presence as Banner's co-worker and ex girlfriend Betty Ross. Connelly gets to do some of what she does best here, reflecting on how Betty has had to deal with rejection her entire life, whether by her father, General Ross (a perfectly cast Sam Elliot, also a very strong presence) or Bruce's seeming refusal to show any emotions to anyone, no matter how intimate their relationship. Cameos also from Hulk creator Stan Lee and original television Hulk Lou Ferringo as security guards at Banner's research facility.But Nick Nolte is the most commanding character on display here, as Banner's father, who experimented on himself before impregnating his wife to see how the child would turn out. Nolte plays the 'sick and disturbed' element in strong gear here, to good effect, and the character is developed quite well until he tries to duplicate the gamma ray malfunction which turned his son into the Hulk, which miraculously bestows him with the power to convert his physical form into whatever matter he touches. (fans of the comics will recognize these powers as belonging to the 60s supervillain called Absorbing Man) Although enormously hard to take in, even for a comic book movie, the movie still hasn't quite lost us completely yet. No, that will be saved for the finale, with Banner's newly transformed father trying to somehow absorb Hulk's powers out of him, in a huge, visually revolting sci-fi battle with the seas spewing up and the sky splitting up and the air swirling around them in a way which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, no matter how hard you try to reason it out. The death of Banner's father is also completely unexplained (something about him bursting from trying to absorb all matter in the universe, or something just plain stupid like that) as is Banner's ability to survive the following explosion, and seemingly instant ability to speak Spanish afterwards, when trying to restart his life as an emergence doctor for needy refugees. But after the absurd final battle, the movie has completely lost it's sense of reality, so we barely notice these rather glaring plot holes.Hulk was built on a good premise, but proves too overconfident in it's own sense of drama to really turn out very good. Add an absurd, reality deprived final battle, some awful CGI forming the title character and some really confusing 'comic style' filmography which proves impossible to watch, and by the end of the film, we are feeling very angry. And you won't like an expectant viewer when they're angry...-6/10",Hulk

A monster that only get stronger as he gets madder.Eric Bana does a good job portraying the scientist, but I think what let it fail was the action scenes involved Hulk running away, the villain at the end, Bruce's father wasn't as menacing as Hulk's other villains.However I'm looking forward to the Incredible Hulk a reboot of the films.",Hulk
85,PatrynXX,"As bad as I thought it would be, but liked it more than I thought I would!",4,30 July 2004,"(spoilers??)I didn't really wanna watch this movie.  But Netflix shipped it anyway.  My fault.  So it took a few weeks to get to.  Finally did and yep.  It sucked. Quality wise that is.  Lets see, we've got plot holes, absurd camera angles (the comic book look just doesn't work)  obvious cameo's.  Stan Lee's half hearted attempt at being serious was a total laugh.Not only do we have plot holes, but we have a vague plot.  That gets incredibly confusing at times.  Characters switch personalities quite often. Father Banner is totally nuts.  Going from nice guy with morals to sorded murderer.  Similar to Jenn's father general.  (ross??)  he goes from.  okay lets be nice to the guy to I'm gonna kill that SOB if thats the last thing I do.  Then we've got the corporate guy Talbot who is a total loser.  This character did not need to be in the movie.  He was totally useless.  He was put there for reactionary purposes only.  Not acting whatsoever there.  He was so much better in A Beautiful Mind.The back story is rushed.  A younger banner is introduced after being a kid. This scene isn't needed.  Except for just a couple more people on the payroll.The CGI is pretty good at times, but the far off shots are really poorly done.  Poor editing in this movie.  Even at it's worst, Spider Man 1 is better in quality than this.
But the funny thing here is I like the Hulk more than I thought I would. Perhaps it's because of Jennifer, or Nick Nolte.  I don't know.  But something was just within reach of this director, and they missed it by a long shot.

86,DunnDeeDaGreat,My expecations were meet,7,28 June 2003,"A lot of the ealry reviews had been complaining about the CGI work in The Hulk and now that movie has come out more people are complaining about how boring the movie is. I'll admit when I first find out they were making a Hulk movie I had my resverastions as soon as I found out there would no classic Marvel villain other than General Ross in the film, I would have loved to see Charles Dance or Alan Ruck play The Leader.  So on opening day I mainly went to see the movie to see what Mr. Ang Lee could do with the direction and I was impressed. Lee's editing and split screen transations and wipes give the film a real comic book affect which is why the film impressed me so much. Eric Bana whose carrer I haven't really followed does well as Bruce Banner as do the always good Jennifer Connely and Sam Eillot. I think in the acting department though the film belongs to Nick Nolte as Bruce's father. I don't really see the film as a comic book movie for the fan boy but more of a thinking person's action movie which is a rarity this summer. I give the film *** stars.",Hulk
87,kevin c,THIS MADE ME ANGRY,2,2 September 2003,"The first hour of this is quite interesting, although a tad slow. However the second half is just useless. Hulk(y) bounces through the desert, and helicopters fire missiles at him. and that really is it. Nolte is particularly poor, as his character zig-zags from good to bad.
Ultimately Lee has, will and just should be doing better stuff than this.",Hulk
88,mentalcritic,Somewhere in the middle...,5,21 September 2004,"Comic book adaptations walk a very dangerous line. Generally, those that succeed do so because they adopt a gritty, realistic feel that taps into the struggle and cynicism of our times. The first two Batman films and the recent X-Men adaptations are good examples of this. By giving the characters a modern sensibility while respecting the original roots of the the story, these films manage to prove the continued relevance of the titular characters.Hulk fails where X-Men and Batman succeeded mainly because it cannot make up its mind whether to root itself in the 1960s style of adaptation, or whether to take a more modern approach. As a result of the hokey, overacted style taken on by the bad guys, Hulk's eventual victory over them seems more pre-ordained than anything resembling a struggle. None of the film ever really feels like it was designed with any other outcome in mind.The strengths of the film start with the moments when the Hulk unleashes his immense rage upon his attackers. The tanks and the helicopters get smashed in a way that appeals to the angry little boy in most of its primary audience. Like it or not, the concept Hulk has always been aimed at young men with anger management issues, and when Hulk displays his chronic lack of self-control coupled with his immense strength, it works best.Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly give the film its other big selling point. During the moments when Bana isn't replaced by a massive CG construct, he gives the man inside the Hulk a human quality that allows the audience to get behind his green alter-ego. But when Bana is out of the picture, it is Connelly who keeps the audience focused. Her simple compassionate pleas for her on-screen father, and by extension the audience, to recognise the humanity in this giant killing machine are what maintain the emotional connection to the character once Bana's contribution is worn out.To be fair, I didn't think this film was as bad as some have made out. The problem is that with competition like X-Men 2, it isn't all that brilliant by comparison, either. Aside from Bruce Banner struggling to solve the pieces missing from his history while Hulk beats the stuffings out of everything that gets in his way, there really isn't that much in the way of story on offer.I gave Hulk a five out of ten. The exposition gets boring on repeat viewings, enough so to make me think about giving it a two out of ten. This is made up for by the incredible fight sequences. If there'd been a couple more moments of throwing tanks or missiles, I might have given it a higher score.",Hulk
89,ODDBear,Complete and utter travesty,1,6 July 2006,"This 2003 modernization of the Hulk by Ang Lee is total and utter garbage. Nothing works in the film's favor, NOTHING.Many have praised the film for it's comic book style look, and it looks good enough; too bad the film is such a disappointment that it doesn't count for much. Director Ang Lee wanted to flesh out Banner's psychological state, and while it may have been fascinating for him to deal with, it's unbearable for the audience. The film drags incredibly and the father vs. son story which takes center stage midway through the film is bad beyond words (climaxing with the father turning into some sort of electric entity???).All the actors are good but here they look bored and uninterested. Who could blame them? Bana, who's proving to be quite the player in Hollywood, completely sleepwalks through the entire proceedings and Connelly doesn't look like she just picked up the Oscar. It's not surprising that Bana, who said earlier that he might want to reprise the role, has suddenly found that he can't find the time to do a sequel (maybe if Ang Lee is MIA he might reconsider his time schedule).Special effects, well, they're good but totally overblown. The look of the Hulk is bad, Lou Ferrigno looks way better as the green giant. Those PJ's he's wearing here are just plain tacky. I for one didn't like those airplane jumps he continually makes and that scene where he grabs hold of a fighter jet and makes the journey to outer space is completely ridiculous. Ahhh, I hate Ang Lee, he's better off directing costume dramas concerning gay cowboys. Is he secretly trying to destroy every tough guy image, whether it be tough horse riders or monster green giants?I'd go as far as to say that a lame episode in the Hulk television series starring Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno is far superior to this piece of junk. If there's a Hulk 2, I pray Ang Lee will stay far away.",Hulk
90,Beta_Gallinger,"Bad acting, a poor script, and a mostly boring 2+ hours",4,14 October 2007,"This is one of several Marvel Comics adaptations of this decade, and one that I went to see while it was in theatres. Previously, I had gone to see ""Spider-Man"" and ""X2"", both of which are good, in my opinion, but when I went to see ""Hulk"", I was bored as I sat in the theatre, and didn't feel so great after I left. It has been four years since then, but I have just given it another try. When I saw it in the theatre, it probably didn't help that I was really thirsty. This time, however, I wasn't, and I was still displeased.In 1966, a scientist named David Banner, who specializes in genetics, becomes the father of a boy named Bruce. When Bruce is only four years old, his father's research is cancelled, which causes the man to go insane, leading to the death of his wife! David Banner is locked up because of this, and Bruce is adopted. After Bruce grows up, he becomes a scientist, and works with his friend, Betty. He is still haunted in his dreams by the repressed memories of his childhood! In a lab accident, he is exposed to gamma radiation, but mysteriously survives! After this, whenever Banner gets angry, he turns into a dangerous green hulk! This may put many people in danger, and General Ross, Betty's father, threatens to lock Bruce up! These Marvel Comics adaptations aren't usually perfect, if they ever are, but I've been impressed with most of the ones I've seen. However, ""Hulk"" is an exception, as it just fails miserably in too many ways. The acting is pretty bad, and the poor script doesn't help, with some laughable lines. Those aren't the only problems, unfortunately. Talbot is often a rather annoying character, and it seems that he's just nasty for the sake of it. In some parts of the film, several different scenes are shown at the same time, on different parts of the screen, which looks a tad silly. The mutated dog fighting scene is ridiculously long, and there may be other scenes that are the same. The film is very dark, and it seems that it's meant to be gripping, but probably due to all the shortcomings, it didn't give me any strong feelings.Sometimes, one can dislike a movie when they first see it, but then it improves with later viewings, but I think my last viewing of ""Hulk"" confirms that I never will like it. Bringing comic book characters to live action movies isn't a bad idea in my book, as I have seen it done well in a good number of films. So, this movie had potential, but unlike many other movies based on Marvel Comics characters, this one did not reach any of it. Since I've never been too familiar with the ""Incredible Hulk"" comic book series, I don't know what hardcore fans would think of this adaptation, but for casual fans of these comic book movies, you might be better off skipping this one.",Hulk
91,vip_ebriega,"Disappointing. I Want to like it, I still don't.",5,8 May 2007,"My Take: An artsy but fatally flawed comic book adaptation. At first, ""Hulk"" sounds like a hell of an a idea. At first watch, I didn't like it, so I repeatedly watched it. And even so, I still didn't. It still has so much CGI and fancy shots, but very little amounts of story and more clearer explanation of events. Don't get me wrong, Ang Lee is a great director, but he didn't do things right with this. Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Nick Nolte, Sam Elliot and Josh Lucas offers some fine performances, but still couldn't uplift this mess of a film. My suggestion for improvements, it's simple really. Less Effects, more story. The special-effects are admittedly great, but it has too much that what the film requires. The effects are too abundant, they had less room for more story ideas. Other pros include a great casting and some fine cinematography. Other weaknesses include poor direction and lack of story.Trust me, as far as it could have been, it could have sounded so much better than a green brute going on a rampage, it would have been a more interesting summer blockbuster.Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",Hulk
92,CitizenCaine,Hulk On The Big Screen,7,28 August 2003,"Another big action movie based on either a comic or cartoon character. I'm sure eventually the studios will get to all of them with the continuing emphasis on big budget action movies with special effects and computer animation. They have many more to choose from before exhausting their choices. I remember seeing the cartoon Hulk, back when I was in grade school, on TV in the afternoon when I got home from school. I never saw the series with Bill Bixby, so I'm not able to comment on or compare it. This movie did an outstanding job of recreating the character I recall from those days. The right actor was chosen to play Hulk. As the reserved Bruce Banner, Eric Bana is perfect as the put upon scientist. His transformation into Hulk is fantastic and his face resembles Hulk afterward. Jennifer Connelly possesses the right combination of intelligence, concern, and vulnerability. Sam Elliott is OK as the general, but nothing special. Nick Nolte is quite good as Doctor David Banner. There were outstanding effects with Hulk jumping for miles, the tank scenes, the dogs scene, etc., but I especially liked the scenes with Jennifer Connelly. They were obviously reminiscent of Beauty and the Beast and King Kong. The movie stopped far short of the pseudo-eroticism displayed in King Kong that predates the Hayes Code I believe. This would have been interesting. Instead, we have scenes of genuine warmth, but no more. It certainly would have been consistent with the characters, but I suppose it might have sliced the family crowd a bit. The movie dragged a bit at times and the plot development in the second half of the movie seemed to serve the display of effects. I'll bet kids, especially overactive boys, love this movie. *** of 4 stars.",Hulk
93,educallejero,Bad decisions all around,1,24 August 2018,"Im probably biased. I just don't see this character. Its just too much. He gets mad and he transforms into a monster. There is little to do, honestly. Maybe if they change the character, maybe if Bruce Banner was violent as a human. A total prick and bully with people but for what he believed were ""good reasons"". Then after the experiment, everytime he lets his rage takes him, people get hurt. When he gains consciousness back, he sees the destruction he produced. Then the movie is about him trying to escape from the Army that wants him as weapon, and him trying to be a better person and don't get mad at everything, because: he knows what happens if he does; because he realizes he was always bullyng people.And even then, although smarter, it sounds boring.And that's what this movie is: Boring + Dumb. Lethal combination. If you put these two together with horrendous visuals/graphics/effects, and lame acting. The result is this atrocity.",Hulk
94,stamper,What doesn't kill him makes him stronger,7,25 August 2003,"I remember watching the TV series The Incredible Hulk back in the 80's and enjoying it quite a lot. In that series, Bill Bixby played Bruce Banner and Lou Ferrigno portrayed the mad Banner a.k.a. the Hulk. The Incredible Hulk was one of the 'few' superhero series I watched when I was a child. I tuned into X-Men a couple of times, I watched Spider Man when I was in my late teens and when I was smaller I watched The Incredible Hulk and the Batman series made in the 60's (maybe The Avengers too if you count them as superheroes). I did not know it or realize it back then, but I always preferred the Marvel superheroes over Batman. Spider-Man was my favorite, then probably the Hulk and then the X-Men, so when Hollywood started making feature films featuring all the superheroes I'd seen as a child, I started to going to the cinema to see them in their new glory. Blade was OK, I loved X-Men, I was very not sure whether Spider-Man would work and I got blown away in the cinema, I felt Blade 2 was good, X2 was a good sequel and since I neither knew Daredevil nor liked the idea of Ben Affleck as a superhero (in pink leather???) I stayed away from him. Knowing the Hulk and having seen Eric Bana in Chopper, I thought I'd pay him a visit, if only for old times sake. Mind you though, that I expected even less of this film than I did of Spider-Man. I did not expect anything but a mediocre film, due to the reviews I'd read and the trailers I'd seen. Why go to see it then? Because I liked the Hulk it when I was a child and because I was curious about what my green friends big screen outing would be like.
Well first of all I can say that I was not disappointed with Hulk. It is a pretty decent film overall, though it has it's flaws. The major flaws of this film, in my opinion, were the action scenes. Not due to crappy computer animation, or because I'd rather seen a guy with green paint on him, but because I thought they lasted too long at times. Not all action sequences were bad though, just the ones involving the military near the ending of the film. The scenes just dragged on too long and didn't make much sense to me, except wasting ammunition. The government / military was overused and too bad without any cruel bad guy being in hand's reach. Also they were plain and simple stupid. Since when is shooting at someone considered soothing? One big point for Ang Lee in this film though. The scene in which David Banner (Nick Nolte) talks to Dr.Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) in her apartment is simply breathtaking. Well done Mr.Lee, you've managed to capture the essence of most Marvel comics: personal tragedy or trauma. Besides that incredible peak there, the long and sometimes boring action sequences and the overlong ending, the film is pretty solid. Lengthy ending + emotional highpoint + overlong and sometimes boring action sequences + solidity >7 out of 10

95,The_Movie_Cat,"""Anger is merely the catalyst.""",6,10 January 2012,"A marketing campaign gone drastically wrong and lukewarm reviews saw a curtailed turnstile visit to theatres for Hulk, a screening time so astoundingly short for a major motion picture that I never even got to see it on the big screen. While I'll now never know if the larger display made the CGI look even worse (is such a thing possible?) Hulk is a film that's more suited to the intimate confines of the home.What surprised me most about the reviews for Hulk is that people were reviewing it not on what it WAS, but on what they thought it should be. Okay, maybe the ad men had a hand to play in it – when they're busy organising toy tie-ins with McDonald's then it's little wonder critics complained that it was over forty minutes before the first appearance of the titular character. But uncalled for were demands to know why it wasn't like the TV series. I mean, I loved the show as well, but Bill Bixby's been sadly long gone now.Such a reactionary response also overlooks the fact that Ferrigno & co. aren't the source text for the film, but that the Hulk was/is a cartoon strip. One thing such uninvited comparisons do make you realise is how daring the TV series actually was by having a lead who isn't your typical ""sexy casting"" and played the eternal outsider. Eric Bana takes up the mantle in a far more photogenic fashion than poor old Bill, though is commendably angst-ridden and insular. Where Toby Maguire earned praise for playing THE Peter Parker, Bana plays A Bruce Banner, an interpretation of the part.To follow the comic book we get the love interest and her General father. Jennifer Connelly holds no real chemistry with Bana, though works well enough, and, to be fair, she does get the worst lines in the generally okay script. Much has been made of Ang Lee telling the story through comic book panels. However, this hardly seems to be the case, and the split screens come over more as a directorial conceit; much like his flirting dangerously against the 180 degree rule in a restaurant scene between Betty and her father. While the director does state that a ""turning page"" effect was tried and rejected for one sequence, the only real source reference comes at the end with the credits in word balloons. On this subject, the only real reference to the television adaptation is (apart from Lou's cameo), Bana's recitation of the infamous catchphrase... albeit in Spanish.For a film in general, then it's not terribly deep. For a summer blockbuster movie (which, of course, it isn't, and never was) then it's way above the norm. With the US military as the nominal villains then politically it came out at an inappropriate time, and there's a backdrop of repressed imagery and childhood dysfunction. There's also some dream shots - like the little girl at a 50s diner in the middle of a nuclear explosion – that are quite perversely beautiful.Okay, I can't hold it off. The Hulk. It looks terrible. Even Stevie Wonder would throw popcorn at the screen in derision, as a gratuitously fake computer nymph wanders the screen looking like he's in the wrong film. His interaction with other characters, such as Nolte touching his face, totally eradicates any semblance of illusion, and the scene in the woods where he picks Betty up is unintentionally hilarious. The greatest folly of the CGI age? Certainly for every Terminator 2 there's an Alien 3 and the fact that so much expectation for the film – if not the film's narrative – relies on this one effect makes it fail miserably. The same ZX Spectrum also gives the Hulk three super-powered foes. The Sandman? The Rhino? The Leader, perhaps? No – two nutty dogs and a killer poodle. In its defence, Lee suggests on the commentary (where the title quote also came from) that it isn't fully successful and you have to buy into it to enjoy it fully. It's a true enough statement, and while more of a Bruce film than a Hulk film, there are some standout clashes with the military and Nick Nolte's supervillain dad, inspired by – but not recreating – the Absorbing Man.The point is, the CGI doesn't really matter. The film everyone wanted to see would have had Ferrigno painted green for old time's sake, but the film Ang Lee wanted to make was about post-Millennial apprehension, reverse Oedipus syndromes and the controlling of the masculine ID.Finally, one curious phenomenon that happened to me was that the DVD accidentally skipped the first eight minutes or so when I watched it the first time, beginning with Bruce's dad rushing into the house in flashback. Danny Elfman's exotic score is quite enchanting during the movie, but by removing the bombast of the opening theme, the self- conscious credits lettering and unnecessary melodramatic flashback opening the film worked even better. I did find myself wondering where the title of the film actually was, but this more low-key entrance into the narrative did drag me in far more smoothly. What's more, those opening credits do only serve to fuel the ugly rumour that it's a drive-in no brainer.Sadly, attempts to reclaim this as a flawed relative minor masterpiece are on a hiding to nothing as the film has been effectively written out of history by Marvel. An equally good (though in a different way) Hulk movie was released five years later to reboot the franchise, a Hulk movie that ties into 2012's Avengers team up.When they come to write the history of Ang Lee, they'll talk about Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain. It's a shame that no one, not even Lee himself, will want to mention Hulk.",Hulk

97,Angry_Arguer,Complementary Angles,10,23 February 2004,"This is your only spoiler warning...When understood that no ""comic book"" movie is good acting or storytelling, this is great.  Raimi, like Lee, is invested in his camera, but 'Spider' wasn't able to innovate.  It was stuck in 'Batman Forever' visuals.'Crouching Tiger' never caught on with me.  I found it dull and didn't understanding what the hype surrounding Ang Lee.  Then I saw his 'Hire' work.  Lee is a genius because he never makes two movies the same way.  This is better than 'Crouching Tiger'.  I was amazed that there were some meditative Malick moments scattered in the pacing.  He even copies 'the Right Stuff'.  Shocking.If a smart director uses flat actors, he is using them in the ""incidental"" fashion.  Bana is flat, but we knew that already.  Once I got past the alliterative names, I found Nolte's to be the most interesting work yet in an adaptation.  Dafoe was stuck doing the reptilian Bruce Campbell talk-to-the-mirror Schumacher-duality-bit all over again in 'Spider'.  I think it was 'Thin Red Line' that finally set Nolte off and here he's better than Nicholson.I had the (mis)fortune of watching this after 'Natural Born Killers'. Stone's genius for editing in 'JFK' and 'Platoon' was absent, making a migraine.  This was different.  I have rarely experienced such skill with cutting.  'Killers' had visual variety for no purpose, but here the edits have rhyme.  The split-screens capture the essence of comic books.  If 'Terminator' or 'Raiders' had been able to do this, we would be living in different cinematic times.  In the meantime, I'm watching for Tim Squyres' future work because this is terrific.  This revolution took me beyond any script, acting, or even physics problems.  Without it, it's 'Godzilla' all over again.  Rejoice my editing brethren, we've found a new hit!That brings me to the minor quibbles.  Rystrom's sonic ability since 'Private Ryan' has lost quality.  'T2' was interesting, this is dull. Ironically, Lee's commentary on the DVD makes better listening.  Meanwhile, Muren and Lantieri duplicate their 'Jurassic'  water gag and ILM reuses the 'T2' feet-fusion effect.The dominant sets are circular and the camera doesn't exploit the curves.  I guess the production designer didn't learn from Truffaut.  The script, of course, is a werewolf movie.  Man and beast, beast in man.  Trying to go any deeper than that is pointless.  One last thing.  Howard Shore should have done the soundtrack because he is more attuned to moods--after working with Cronenberg, Fincher, and Demme--than genres.For now, I recommend looking into the 'Hire' series of shorts for any film philosopher because it shows how open-minded Hollywood is getting.  We have the ""old man"" style of Frankenheimer, the energy of Wai-Wong, Woo, and Lee, and the revisionist Carnahan, Inarritu, and Ritchie.  There is also the pure hokum of Tony Scott.  In each you'll see a microcosm of film with each director emphasizing different elements.  It's the most variety since the 'Alien' series.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material",Hulk

99,aesgaard41,What do you epect from a Comic Book Movie?,9,2 January 2004,"To bring a comic book character to life, it is often a lot more than just putting an actor in a costume. The other factors are a decent script with an active plot, good personalities brought to life by capable actors, an intense musical score and vivid special effects. I had my own idea years ago of how a Hulk movie should be, and while this movie gets to be more psychological than the series, the cartoons or the comics, this movie actually reaches many if but not all of my expectations. Eric Bana would not have been my first choice to be David Banner; that honor would go to Scott Bakula, but Bana does do a very good turn as a person carrying much emotional trauma, a slightly nerdish reluctant hero hesitant to accept his new ability. Jennifer Connelly takes the place of my choice of Susan Gibney as Betty Ross and turns in a bit of a wooden performance in a career move that will forever tie her down to comic book and sci-fi conventions. Sam Elliot delivers a strong presence, but the movie build-up is long and many of the best scenes are wasted and lost in intense shadow. I actually liked the movie, and ""Hulk"" has more than adequately all the best properties for a decent comic book movie across the board. Josh Lucas, however, struggles to stay aloft in the rush of scenes. His Glenn Talbot is a smarmy opportunist with questionable ethics, a far cry from the original career driven character. One of the movie's failing points is the inclusion of Nick Nolte as Banner's scheming conspiratorial father who sees his son only as his property. Although Nolte is excellent in the role, he's just one villain too far and the thick psychological issues are too intense, so intense that the action scenes are too far and few between. However, the movie has actually been condemned over Ang Lee's emphasis to deal with the psychological issues with the characters rather than to provide a strong plot or an impressive enough fight scene. The CGI Hulk, however, seems a bit too massive; in the comics, he's only supposed to be seven feet tall, but in the movies, he tops between ten and twelve feet tall. The CGI at times although impressive is far from extraordinary, seemingly dated, but overall, despite the heavy psychological score, the entire movie comes off as almost operatic, and the multiple ""comic book"" boxes has the feel of watching a living comic book. It's a great movie, well worth watching, making up for a living comic book as it uses scenes boxed in pop-ups. Stan Lee is the new Alfred Hitchcock as he pops up along with none other than Lou Ferrigno, the original Hulk. I would have wished Lou had more scenes and maybe have had heard at least one character named Bixby, but the overall movie is visually stunning and very satisfying. I have little to complain about.",Hulk

102,FilmOtaku,This comic book geek loved it!,8,3 July 2003,"I finally saw The Hulk yesterday and was expecting nothing. I had seen the trailers and commercials and thought it was pretty lame looking, but after reading a favorable review on Aint It Cool News, and after realizing that I am such an old school comic geek that I couldn't stay away from a comic book film, I acquiesed.And I LOVED it. I loved the tragedy, I thought the CGI was a helluva lot better than I thought it was going to be, and I loved the cartoonish way it was directed. My friend and I talked about it in the theater parking lot afterward, and I was saying how I respect the work of Ang Lee so much that I was concerned when I heard that he was going to take on The Hulk... BUT, I knew if anything, he would bring some interesting elements to the story. And he did. For anyone who read the comic book, the story IS a tragic one and not solely all ""Hulk Smash!"" (But I'll admit, I did growl ""Hulk Smash"" on a few occasions and longed to buy the Hulk Hands from the Target across the street from the multiplex afterward. As far as the acting goes, I've learned to never expect good acting in action films, much less good acting in films based on comic books or graphic novels because they are cartoonish in nature. Off the top of my head, I can only think of a couple of exceptions to the rule: Jack Nicholson as the Joker and Thora Birch as Enid and Steve Buscemi as Seymour in Ghost World. Therefore, I took no issue with the bland acting - although a friend of mine mentioned that Eric Bana's physical transformation into Corey Feldman was frightening.Acting-wise however, he played the part like he was supposed to. Bruce Banner is bland, well, cuz otherwise we get into that whole Hulk Smash area again. Unfortunately, I can never forgive Jennifer Connelly for, well, being Jennifer Connelly. She's horrid, and her Oscar win is in the same best supporting actress vein as Marisa Tomei, Mira Sorvino and Kim Basinger. I also cannot watch a movie featuring this woman without picturing her in the last 10 minutes of Requiem for a Dream so I always have that stigma to contend with.In short, I really did like The Hulk. I thought it was visually interesting and appropriately dramatic. --Shelly",Hulk
103,EijnarAmadeus,"Come on, Hulk boy. Go nuts!!",4,12 July 2003,"HULK (2003) spoiler alert((( Well, Eric Bana is pretty cool (on the ARENA front page, hmm). The Hulk is the newest from director Ang Lee, the man behind the balletic and elegant kung-fu drama Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. This time he has gone further and gives us lots of special effects and rather entertaining sequences. Well, the thing is. The opening of Hulk almost parodying the two superhero - success X-MEN and SPIDER-MAN, and we also soon notice that the filming from Lee is pretty rare and out of the ordinary as he flash and zoom out and cartoon strips appears and lots of odd, but nice stuff as that.
Eric Bana plays the part as Bruce Banner, a scientist that lost his parents from many years ago. He lives a calm life but are having some unpleasent dreams sometimes. So, he does genetic experiences and one day everything goes wrong and Bruce saves a buddy's life with taking all of the pain, without knowing that this we cost him even more problems in his life (though there wasn't many). So, Bruce surprisingly survives the strike and soon he has a skill that scares him as much as people around him. When Bruce gets mad (angry, upset - whatever you may call it), he suddenly starts getting bigger and...yeah, green! In few seconds, you may call him: The Hulk! A creature that bulletts simply bounds off and wounds heals themselves. So, when Bruce gets to be Hulk all off his power, rage and furiousity gets together and explodes into a violent mood swing!! That makes him attack stuff...as a military squad that gets very interested in Hulk's way of being....and, to put it this way; Hulk, won't let anything come in his way! In all this; Bruce's father David Banner who did make a science experience on him while he was a child returns (just as mad as back then), Bruce are working with his old flame and...his old flame's dad put HIS dad away back then and her dad hates the idea of any Hulk!So, whatever Hulk is doing, he is the show alone. Whether he is biting off ends of rockets and spitting them back, swinging thanks like they were a Olympic game, fighting genetic dogs, smashing offices, jumping lunatic and even showing emotions...he is the SHOW!!!!! Though the thing I missed about Hulk was: too little action, this is a kind of movie where they had so much opportunities to play Hulk thta they should rather have packed it with explosive action then feelings and too much talking and drama, though this makes it more a movie. Well, The Hulk is entertainment, and pretty much of it too, though the really bad scene in the movie is the finale between p***ed off son and p***ed off dad...what's this man?!! Suddenly the movie gets big and in a way so important and blown up, that really sucks. The CGI (if it isn't, I call it Computer Generated Images) isn't that good either, and then The Hulk all the way is a huge animated guy, or I like to call him: Mean Green Fighting Machine!Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly plays the two main characters as before in love. The two smaller characters are the two dads; that both are famous actor - Bana's father Nick Nolte and Connelly's father Sam Elliot. It is jolly good time after time, though maybe a bit boring in the length with all the so-called ""tosh-tosh"". STARS: *** 3/5 (good, but: more action Lee!!!!)",Hulk
104,nicholls905-280-546911,Different superhero film,5,2 December 2019,"The film attempts to be serious, but there are some weird beats here. The dog ambush and that anticlimactic finale weren't the ideal choice for a film already struggling with pacing. Hollywood has struggled with The Hulk, even the Marvel adaptation failed to maintain an audience. This film had an interesting intention with the editing design and the acting is quite okay. It's the connections to the comic book world that drags this film down. This is not the film fans deserved and Ang Lee wasn't the correct filmmaker. He is a gifted filmmaker, but not everyone is suited to the genre. More of an indie film, not a mass marketed action film. This would make for an interesting character focused sci fi drama film, not the summer blockbuster. A film made for no one essentially, and that's the shame.",Hulk
105,jessegehrig,I will accept a check,2,25 November 2020,"The villain doesn't appear until the final 15 minutes of the movie. The best visual effects where not CGI. The small fortune spent on CGI is entirely non-refundable, yeah and it looks bad. Jennifer Connelly can act. Eric Bana can act. The script and the direction they were given made it impossible for either to do their job, acting. Three people are credited for writing the screenplay, all three should have been fired. Also, the serious tone was not befitting of a comic book action movie, you can make a high brow Hulk movie but for it to work it would have to be rated R.",Hulk
106,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,3,17 March 2015,"Forgettable superhero film exploring the origins of Bruce Banner (Bana), a genetics researcher who suffers a lab accident involving gamma radiation. The result: he has the capability of changing into a green-skinned monster when angry. The temper tantrums get him enough attention to be pursued by the United States military, but maybe the cast and crew should've pursued other projects. There's nothing much here except boredom and disappointment. While the film does have its moments and can be commended for its attempt at not being completely brainless, there is no payoff for an action film that doesn't have all that much action.*½ (out of four)",Hulk
107,tomimt,Not the best superhero film.,5,10 March 2005,"It must be hard to write decent movie about probably the stupidest comic book hero ever created. Let's face it: Hulk ain't the most intelligent creature to have long, meaningful dialog with.So, what they dried to do, was to bring out the internal suffering of Bruce Banner (Eric Bana), as he tries to struggle against the monster within. Other actors? Well, everyone was just so typical. Hard to pick anyone specific from there. Nick Nolte had nice role. Probably the best in whole movie as Bruce's father, who was responsible of Bruce's double identity. Jennifer Connoly was pretty in her role as Betty Ross, Bruce's, and Hulk's, object of desire.I must confess, I've never been a fan of Hulk comics. I didn't hate them either, I just didn't care about the character. Green, muscular idiots rarely appeal to me. SO I didn't wait much from this movie either. And usually, when you approach something from that point of view you wont be disappointed badly. But in this case it's really hard to think much to say of this film.Well first, Ang Lee tried, I mean he really tried to make a comic book movie. I mean literally. He used divided screen all the time. Action of the movie was very comic book like. I felt I was watching animated comic instead of a movie. That made it real hard to take this flick seriously, even tough it did try. But it failed, tough in some places it was very fitting. Maybe it would been better, if they'd just made this a animation film. Dunno.And second, the special effects. Well, they worked in some places, but sadly it was far too obvious, that Hulk was fully computer generated character. He just looked so fake and out of placed in many scenes.I'd say it was worth 5 out of 10.",Hulk
108,gigan-92,Horribly Underrated!!,7,22 November 2010,"B+ Ang Lee's Hulk was received pretty poorly upon its initial release. I'm pretty sure the rating along with its already negative reputation plunged sharply at the 2008 release of ""the Incredible Hulk"". For God's sake, it's in the five range! I've seen terrible films with much high ratings, which is pretty upsetting really. So, which one is really better, Louis Letterier, or Ang Lee? That's a hard one but let's be real here people. The only reason the new be was received so much better is because the director had handled films like ""transporter"". With that said, the film was obviously faster-paced, had grittier action and a more intense and vein-detailed Hulk. It's obvious that Lee was aiming for something different than what most audiences were expecting and badly wanted. That's not to say that the action is all the 2008 film has to offer, but it definitely made it's focal point. Lee's Hulk had phenomenal acting, semi-deep characterization with a lot of in-between the lines inter-weaving of it all. Nicely done, but albeit a bit too heavy for a Marvel film I suppose.This film has few, if any real problems, but the ones that are there I suppose would upset action junkies. Pacing can be somewhat slow, although the way Lee shot the film it maintained my attention throughout. Forgettable performances, with the talents of Eric Bana, Sam Elliot, Nick Nolte, Jennifer Connelly, not even close. Terrible score; hell no, Danny Elfman provided it, and it flows quite well. So, with all that out in the open , the only thing left is the climax: Now where as the majority of the film provides great action, I'll admit the ending could've used more actual fighting, but it still delivers emotionally and (Elfman you genius) thematically. As I've noted with ""Superman Returns"", when a well known hero is made into a movie by an acclaimed director (Ang Lee/ Bryan Singer), but because it is a tad lengthy and doesn't have a hand-to-hand monster/super human fight at the climax (which Letterier made sure of in 2008 with the epic brawl in '08) people are left disappointed and begin nitpicking off reasons to dislike the film.While the movie may have been re booted, this one I still highly recommend.",Hulk
109,Bogmeister,Misguided attempt at deep comic book Hulking pathos,4,17 July 2005,"Unlike the contemporary Spider-Man films (2002 & 2004) and, to nearly the same extent, the X-Men films (2000 & 2003), this 2003 effort misses the mark as far as finding the core element which made this monsterish super-hero a big success for over 40 years. In cases such as these, it always begs the question: what made the filmmakers believe they were smarter than forty years of p r o v e n success? Ego maybe? Much of this fault (besides the screenwriters) lies with director Lee, who fixated on odd patterns (son-father relations, terrain, comic book panel ambiance) instead of the power emanating from pure rage unleashed. The old TV series ('78-'82) captured this essence better, despite budget limitations that restricted epic storytelling. The fact is, the scenes of the Hulk raging are rather flat and uninspired. Ang Lee himself, as revealed behind-the-scenes, stepped in to use motion-capture computer technology to map out the Hulk's movements; he might've been better off using a professional mime or actor. The story drifts off-course early on, switching to Berkeley, CA as the locale for Banner's life (before first Hulking-out) when it should have remained in the eerie desert. It then re-introduces the main villain, Banner's father, and pretty much makes him the main character. I can't fault Nolte's performance as a mad scientist, but he belongs in another picture. Towards the end, he's transformed into this movie's version of Marvel Comics long-time villain The Absorbing Man, just one of the plot diversions that occur for no reason other than the writer was bored and didn't know what else to do. The Hulk's first appearance is in the dark and I suspect this was done to cover-up unconvincing computer FX. Later, he grows in size from bullet impacts - again, a plot twist deviating from the character to, what, let the animators show off a larger Hulk? In the final act, the military (the one aspect from the comics they got right) lets the two super-powered beings sit together (again, because the writer was at a loss) and stand back to watch until they both explode into final battle. I don't pretend to understand the strategy there. Oh, and I haven't even mentioned the 3 dogs, yet. With several good villains to choose from (Leader, Abomination,etc.) the filmmakers choose to have the Hulk scrap with three mutated mutts, including a poodle. Maybe they were saving better foes for the sequel. Never save the good stuff for a film which may never happen.",Hulk
110,movieguy1021,The Hulk: 9/10,9,26 June 2003,"If you go into The Hulk expecting Spider-Man, you'll be surprised. With only a few action scenes, and more drama than you can shake a stick at, it's clearly the best comic book movie to date, and, so far, the best summer movie. I'm actually surprised that Ang Lee would risk losing the teen demographic for this, but the movie turns out better for it. The Hulk has a perfect mix of action and drama, and, although I don't read comic books, has the feel of a comic book.Kudos goes out to Lee for turning in an excellent directing job. With more split-screens than The Thomas Crowne Affair, it may get annoying for some people, but to me, I really liked it. Also, Lee didn't always have the whole screen covered up by the movie. Although the split-screen wasn't always necessary, it added to the unique look of the movie. Lee wasn't a Hulk fan before he signed on to direct this movie, but the whole thing looks like a giant comic bookyou'll have to see it to understand what I mean.The plot is actually THERE; it's involving and has depth. Scientist Bruce Krenzler (Eric Bana) is working on the same project his father David Banner (Nick Nolte) worked on years earlier, a human regeneration project. David tested it on himself, and passed it on to Bruce. However, they become separated, and Bruce moves into the Krenzler's house. However, he is reunited with David, but an explosion in the lab causes Bruce to become a giant, green, CGI Hulk every time he becomes angry.If a movie this far-fetched can seem so real and plausible, then that can only mean one thing: everyone involved with this movie deserves a raise. Usually Universal movies have cheesy special effects (U-571 for instance), and the Hulk in no way looked real, but for a CGI dude in a live action world, it worked well. When the Hulk interacted with humans, I was in awe. However, at the end, when the Hulk was fighting another CGI monster, that looked like it was a sigh of relief for the crew.Bana proves that not every superhero has to have a bad actor play him (i.e. George Clooney in Batman and Robin), in fact, he's a great actor, and now that he's sort of well known here in the States, he'll probably get better roles (the same is happening to Tobey Maguire after his role in Spider-Man). Jennifer Connelly, for the first half, shows that yes, she is a good supporting actress, but in the third act, makes the Academy wonder what they were thinking when they gave out her best supporting actress for A Beautiful Mind. `Let me talk to him, Dad.' `Dad, let me talk to him.' Sam Elliott, who plays Betty's (Connelly) over-bearing, military father who has something against the Banners, does what he's supposed to do. The real standout, however, is Nolte, yet again. After his somewhat lackluster work in The Good Thief, he's back again, stronger than ever.Many people won't like The Hulk because they want it to be what it isn't: another mindless action movie for the summer. It's actually one of the most intelligent movies of the summer, and, dare I say, the year, so far, and expect it to be on my top ten list for the year.My rating: 9/10Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence, some disturbing images and brief partial nudity.",Hulk
111,Min111,Hulk smash,5,17 August 2020,"He happens to be one of the most ""popular"" superheroes in Marvel. Personally, he's one of my favourites. Everyone knows the Hulk. Hulk is huge. Hulk is tough. Hulk is strong. Hulk is powerful. Hulk is green. He's a monster. He's a scientist. He's an avenger. Luckily, he's on the right side. This is what the movie depicts, and I liked it. It's a Hulk movie. It's a fine movie. Hulk happens to be Bruce Banner who is a human. When he's angry, he turns into a green monster known as the Hulk. His rage gets the better of him. I'm very surprised there was no sequel. Hulk 2 would've been good. The story is right there. At the same time, I'm happy there was no sequel. Hulk on its own is fine. I like the poster or front cover by the way. It represents Hulk very well. I also had the game on PlayStation 2 - that was a great game to play. It's exactly the same as the movie. Green happens to be one of my favourite colours, so that's why I like the Hulk. In fact, I like the character, Hulk, for many reasons. The movie is not part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I can see Hulk is a popular movie for many. It's for Hulk fans! A lot of people like Hulk because it's one of the few Hulk movies out there. It has a sizeable following. There's plenty of action in Hulk. The movie runs for over two hours. It's long. It's entertaining. I like the ""story"" how Bruce Banner turns into the Hulk. The movie explains it very well, and that's what I like about the movie. Be sure to check it out. Hulk is a superhero movie. Don't make the Hulk angry otherwise he'll destroy everything.

112,mfellipecampos,Weak,4,27 May 2021,"The Hulk who hasn't crushed enough! The year was 2003, and the 'Era Heroic' of cinema was taking its first steps. After the successes of X-Men (2000) and Spider-Man (2002), it was only a matter of time before another character very present in the popular imagination also won his chance on the big screen. Therefore, in the wake of the success of his peers, the Hulk of Ang Lee appears. But, something went wrong ... what would have been? The computer-generated creatures that we are used to seeing in theaters have evolved a lot, and the Hulk that we have today with the Avengers 'convinces' in texture, expressions and movements. However, the CGI version of the anti-hero designed for his first foray into the big screen received harsh criticism, being considered too superficial, almost a cartoon. There were even those who compared him to the ogre Shrek (it was not for that)! And, if a film has a digital protagonist who is not convincing enough, the whole experience of watching it can be terribly compromised. Despite its visual aspect, however, the tone chosen for the feature also seems to have been wrong. Taiwanese director Ang Lee, known for his 'sensitive' works, wanted to give his character an authorial touch, and chose to delve deeply into Dr. Bruce Banner's psychological (played by Eric Bana) and his inner conflicts after the effects of radiation to which he was subjected (in this version) since childhood by his father (Nick Nolte), with whom he starts to maintain a turbulent relationship. The bombardment of gamma rays that affects him is only the trigger for something that has been latent for a long time to manifest. After a lot of suspense (and little action), when the Hulk finally appears on the scene - in this project that came to be called 'superhero art film' - almost an hour of projection has passed. What comes next is a series of tireless pursuits - in the midst of a melancholy desert - perpetrated by the army, under the leadership of General Ross (Sam Elliott), who sees the Hulk as a monster to be fought, and a focused dramatic outcome in the reckoning between father and son. Containing some bizarre things, like 'hulk-dogs' and the villain showing 'symptoms' of Absorbent Man, the plot still reserves space for the eternal parallel of the emerald giant with Beauty and the Beast, through the involvement between Banner and Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly), the general's daughter. The dense and intimate narrative, added to the contemplative and bucolic atmosphere, in addition to the peculiarities mentioned above, meant that the production did not please the large audiences. It is curious that these same aspects pointed out as defects, if seen from another angle, could be considered as qualities! But this intellectual approach was not what the audience expected, and Lee's film ended up falling into oblivion, especially since, just five years later, a new version was made, this time already inserted in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and with results ( a little) better, achieved with a more aggressive exploration of the ""Hulk smash"" style of the emerald giant.

Ang Lee (""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"") wanted to make the movie more of an artsy mainstream movie. The movie didn't do too well with all the hype back in 2003 with some audiences having mixed feelings especially some critics complaining that it was a little slow and didn't have much action. I thought the film was good but not great and not as bad as some people put out, i thought the film had some good casting like Connelly who is lovely as ever playing Ross and Eric Bana was a good choice playing Dr. Banner and i thought the special effects by ILM are nicely done even if the Hulk didn't look too realistic enough.Ang Lee did try to get a major audiences but at least he tried, i'm sure the new sequel with Edward Norton should be an improvement over this movie and judging from the looks of the teaser to the second film Hulk now looks more realistic this time.",Hulk
114,Mr_Sensitive,"It Was A Disappointment, But It Ain't That Bad",5,31 January 2005,"Even though the movie contains some good and famous actors, I didn't really expect any thing much from this movie. And it did turn out right. The movie starts out extremely slow for the comic movie making it very boring at first. And it took more or less quarter of a length of the movie before he turn into a HULK. Then, I meant then it start to be OK. But the way he turn into a HULK is way to simple and very unconvincing.Anyway after he turns into a HULK the movie started to flow with some acting that are good and interesting. Especially the scene that he fights with 3 hulk dogs and is very intense and somewhat scary. Even though HULK here may look like a rubber doll, I still say it is a very satisfying CGI with all the muscle movement etc. The directing is comic like making it pretty unique comic style.After all it is a watch able movie, but the truth - it should have been much better, especially the ending.Rating: 5.5/10 (Grade: C)",Hulk
115,LebowskiT1000,Bad choice for director.,7,21 December 2005,"I remember back when I first heard that Hulk was being made into a motion picture. At the time I was rather excited, as I grew up watching the Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno TV Show and really loved it. But then a bit later a director by the name of Ang Lee was hired on to helm the film. I vividly remember my first thoughts: ""He is going to ruin it!"" At the time I'd only seen two other Ang Lee films, ""The Ice Storm"", which was a fine film, but nothing spectacular and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (Which personally I thought was a complete waste of time). So, yeah, I'll be the first to admit that I judged the film before I'd even seen it, but I knew his directing style and it just wasn't going to fly with ""Hulk"". After seeing the preview I was less than thrilled with the special effects, but even still, it looked like it might be fun and just maybe he'd prove me wrong. Sadly, he did not.In some respects, the film was better than expected, but not many. For instance, I thought the special effects were much better than they originally looked in the trailers...it may have been that they were in context within the film, maybe they had more time to work on them, or maybe I'd just come to terms with them, I don't know. But in any case I thought they looked pretty damn good at certain points and rarely looked terrible.It is my personal opinion that in order to make a really good comic-to-film adaptation you need to base the film in reality and then throw in some border-line far-fetched sci-fi and finally some fantastic characters, all without going too far. In my opinion Ang Lee went too far with the fantastic-ness of Hulk. Bullet-proof...OK, maybe. Being able to hurl himself miles in a single bound...I don't think so. It's not a major plot point in the film by any means, so I could get passed it, but it was just a little too much for me...it made him look a little too cartoonish.The fact that you have to watch quite a bit of character development before you get to see the green beast didn't bother me too terribly much, but the editing, the acting and the way the story was told did bother me. I really didn't like the whole comic-book-editing that he tried in the film. Sometimes it worked, but other times it was too distracting and made it painfully hard to ""get into"" the film. Personally, I dislike any editing that reminds me that I'm watching a film and that this is not reality.As far as the acting talent goes, I thought it was less than impressive. Sam Elliott is usually a great actor, but I found him incredibly annoying in this film, like he was acting overly angry throughout the entire film. Eric Bana was OK, but I didn't buy his angry moments, he just didn't pull it off. Jennifer Connolly did a fine job however, I can't say anything bad about her. Josh Lucas was decent, but nothing spectacular. Nick Nolte was also decent, but very annoying at times, more due to the dialog than his acting abilities.And the last order of business is the actual story used to bring ""Hulk"" to life. For the most part, I thought the story was actually pretty good with some really good ideas...but then again, there were some god-awful ideas too. The entire last 20 minutes of the film was HORRIBLE, just plain RIDICULOUS (special effects were pretty good though). As one other reviewer on this site said, it seemed like they ran out of ideas so they slapped together something to get the film released, while not bothering to think that perhaps this just doesn't make any sense. There were also other minor story points throughout the film that either didn't make sense, seemed silly, or just plain didn't work.I'd also like to say a little something about the soundtrack. The soundtrack was really good, but way too repetitive, I was in shock how many times the main theme was used. It sounded good, but too much of a good thing makes it not a good thing anymore.All in all this could have been a really good film with a different director. Ang Lee may be a good director within certain genres, but comic-based films is not one of them. I'd place this film somewhere between Daredevil, Punisher and Elektra as far as quality goes. Far below Spider-man (1&2), X-Men (1&2...and probably 3), Fantastic Four, and Batman Begins. Although, it was far better than Catwoman. I guess I can say this, if you are a die-hard fan of Ang Lee and like experimental films, then you might like this film. If you want a fast-paced, fun comic-book film, this is probably not the film for you.",Hulk
116,EmperorNortonII,The Hulk's Cinematic Transformation,8,1 July 2003,"The latest comic book adaptation to hit the screen is Ang Lee's ""The Hulk."" Here, Lee brings the popular Marvel comic to life, literally.  Many times the screen is shot too look like comic book panels.  The story does take certain liberties with the origin of the Incredible Hulk.  Although I did find it interesting how natural science was used to explain some of Dr. Bruce Banner's transformation (i.e., jellyfish for his green coloration, starfish for his regenerative powers, etc.).  Another good point is the excellent CGI work used to create the Hulk.  It certainly looks better than it did in the TV spots!  The scene in which the Hulk battles the giant mutated dogs is very memorable.  Where else can you see a poodle so frightening?  All the while, you can just see the humanity beneath the green exterior.  The Hulk's rage may be blinding and consuming, but he can still show some intelligence and compassion.

117,dilipbts,Hulk,5,7 June 2020,"Hulk is a very surprising film. When I first saw it when I was like nine or ten I was confused, shocked and somewhat disappointed. My expectations at the time had not been met. What I had been expecting and hoping was just endless scenes of the hulk smashing sh#t up. What I got was an art film. At the time I didn't understand or care about any of the split screens, dream sequences, etc, I was just waiting for the hulk to show up and destroy stuff.(The hulk dosen't show up till about 40 minutes into the movie, by the way.) I eventually began to get restless because it is a very slow movie and when it was over I felt very disappointed.A few years later I bought the DVD to give it another try, and I was very surprised with how good it actually was, now that I had gotten older and could appreciate the style, acting and pretty much everything else. The acting is quite good in the film, especially Nick Nolte, who almost steals the show as Bruce Banner's father, David Banner. Eric Bana is decent as the hulk, but I prefer Mark Ruffalo as the hulk in the avengers. Unlike other movies based on comic books, Hulk actually looks like a comic book, due to the split screens. This works most of the time,as it gives the film a unique look thats different from other comic book movies.Now to the much criticised CGI, which for me is a mixed bag. The close ups of the hulk work, because his facial expressions are well done and you can actually feel sympathy for him. However the long shots of him, especially in the desert scenes, look a bit cheesy but definitely not as bad as some critics have been saying. Apart from that the visual effects are top notch.Overall, Hulk is a refreshing change from standard and bland superhero movies. It takes its time setting up the plot and characters, which works because you have almost fully fleshed out characters and not cardboard cut outs. The repressed memories and psychology of the hulk is much more interesting than the standard heroics of superman or captain America. So to sum it up, I wouldn't recommend this movie to young kids because there are a number of intense scenes and it is a fairly long and slow movie, so those with short attention spans won't be well rewarded. But for those who are prepared to accept that it is more an art film than an action film then you will be well rewarded.The film isn't perfect, but every time I watch it on DVD it grows on me and I find myself wishing sometimes that more action blockbusters were like this, but then if they were I doubt they would be blockbusters.",Hulk
118,departed07,This time the fury has been unleased,10,22 June 2003,"There have been many comic book movies onto the screen: The X-Men films, the Batman saga, Spider-Man, Dick Tracy, Daredevil, etc. Now in Ang Lee's Hulk, it's quite different than the following films I have mention. What makes it unique is the fact that Ang treats the comic book itself like a comic book, where the scenes are cut into strips leaving a sense that Lee knows what he is doing.Hulk starts with the prologue of a young David Banner (an older version is played by Nick Nolte) as he tries to work on gamma rays with species he already kills, in the beginning his character is banned from the U.S. Army by Col. ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (an older version played later by Sam Elliot) because he injects gamma rays on his son Bruce for which he has no reaction and afterwards Banner sets off a radioactive bomb for which the base itself will explode along with the people living there. David tries to kill his son but accidentally kills his wife in the process.Years later young Bruce Banner grows up (played by Eric Bana) and works at a facility research, for which he now has flashbacks of things that look obscure to him. His assistant is the lovely Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly), the daughter of ""Thunderbolt"" Ross. Like his father, Bruce is working with gamma radiation on wounded animals, and in one scene, a bullfrog blows up after exceeding too much gamma rays. I like that scene because it shows how much experiments can go bad.Though there aren't any bad guys for the film, but there's one that people will consider a ""villain"" and that character is Glenn Talbot (Josh Lucas) who wants to use the formula that Bruce and Betty are using and put is as a weapon of destruction for strength increase on the soldiers for when they go into battle. He bribes Betty and Bruce, but decline the offer.Later in the film, an experiment goes awry as Bruce saves the life of a lab partner from gamma radiation, but has the rays infected on him. In the film he jokes ""I'm not going to blow up,"" but later on he has a visitor: a janitor who looks like a bum, claims that he's Bruce's long lost father, bringing a trio of dogs with him as well.Bruce doesn't transform into the Hulk until one night after locking up the laboratory in which his father knows that his son has grown up to be the creation he'd started when he was young. The monster itself may not look like the original from the TV series, but take my word; he is mean and more ferocious than ever. With the CGI helping, the Hulk is realistic and with Ang Lee's movement involve, the Hulk has never been angrier. In one scene, the Hulk helps Betty from a trio of dogs (who are Nolte's dogs) and the woman realizes that Bruce is the monster.I know after watching the movie, some readers wouldn't agree as I say that ""Hulk"" is a masterpiece in story and action. I stand by my decision when I say that Hulk is ten times better than Daredevil, and that Ang Lee tries to remain true to comic book fans when it comes to telling a story about a comic book hero and how an outcome of a science experiment has gone bad.",Hulk
119,Spanner-2,Problematic comic book film,6,25 June 2003,"This film, featuring the rampaging Marvel Comics character, played by a CGI creature, is an interesting film... The filmmakers decided to expand on the comics storyline with a backstory of Nick Nolte as David Banner's father, and claiming that he was responsible for what becomes of his son. Plenty of scenes with Nolte and Eric Bana as David Banner that play off the father-son conflict and consume much of the first half of this overly long film.. However, the filmmakers seem to have misjudged their audience, thinking that people who go to see a film called ""The Hulk"" want to sit thru an hour and a half of psychobabble before getting to the action. Once the creature finaly appears, we get some entertaining action sequences where he smashes things and battles helicopters and tanks and some fun setpieces. The CGI work is better than expected from the trailers and kinda works in context though it's certainly not realistic by any stretch. Some of Ang Lee's stylistic touches, such as his inventive use of wipes and split screens to aproximate the comic book feel are kinda neat, but don't really advance the storyline. The film has a couple of problems.. the biggest one is that Eric Bana as Banner is so bland and uninteresting that we can't wait for him to get off screen and be replaced by the Hulk, who even as a CGI creation has more personality than Bana does. Jennifer Connelly as the love interest is ok, but the thankless part doesn't let her do much more than look mopey most of the film. Another flaw is the over reliance on a contrived backstory and flashbacks, some of which don't get explained. A definite hit and mess affair, that is still worth seeing for those end fight sequences, though having one key character become a weird water creature at the end didn't make much sense. GRADE: C-",Hulk
120,Flagrant-Baronessa,What went wrong?,6,16 July 2006,"Ang Lee attempted a different approach in his direction in Hulk. The recipe for superhero comic book movie was not followed and for that, it failed in entertaining the mainstream audience. It is more off-beat, more difficult. The music score by Danny Elfman is much heavier than on the average Spider-Man film. The character is not a hero--nor is he a villain. It is a dark story of a pretty dark character. I believe that this is its essentially biggest problem: it is humourless to the core and when featuring a dark character like the Hulk, you need some serious light-hearted comic relief to counter it.I barely even recalled the plot after having watched Hulk, but I remember that it was paper-thin. It's mostly Eric Bana as Bruce Banner coming to terms with his new green identity and the conflicts that this curse this brings. While Bana acts with more conviction and skill than any of the superhero actors (Tobey Maguire, Brandon Routh, even Christian Bale), he is only ever used for acting that varies between the extremes sad or confused in the film. It is not fair that this fantastically talented man is overshadowed by the alter ego of his character.The action scenes are also sub-par and rare. When they are attempted, Lee makes them too overblown to emphasize the sheer strength of the Hulk--and we have a green CGI monster in purple pants spiraling up in the sky--a Shrek on steroids. This may sound like the comic relief that was needed, but it isn't funny -- it's mostly bizarre. Some well-placed and traditional action scenes could and should have been included, in my opinion. It's not ""selling out"" so much as it's balancing the dark Hulk with light entertainment. If you make everything dark, then the character is not going to look dark or stand out.Still, I prefer Hulk to either of the Spider-Man films any day, probably because it has an interesting approach to it. Just..sometimes a little too difficult. 6/10",Hulk
121,PyrolyticCarbon,"Very poor film. Badly written, badly acted, underused and out of place actors, and some crazy scenes.",1,4 January 2006,"I'd heard bad things about this movie, but still I wanted to see it. I thought so highly of Jennifer Connelly in The House of Sand and Fog and was interested to see how she fared alongside a much talked about Eric Bana whom I'd seen in Chopper before. Plus it's Hulk by Ang Lee, that was enough to grab my interest.What a mistake. It's a bad, bad movie. Poor Connelly merely walks around looking bemused and misused with a terribly flat, two dimensional performance while Bana is dull, fixed and very out of place, it was as though he didn't even try acting. Well done to Sam Elliott and Josh Lucas for giving it a good go, but they just can't pull away from the very poor performances of the others. Even Nick Nolte is way over the top here, and it's a comic movie, that's saying something! Performances aside, which really constitutes most of the mess, we have some ridiculous scenes for the Hulk itself. Attacked by a giant killer poodle, leaping miles in a single bound, and managing to reenter Earth's atmosphere and crash into the water without much more than a splash and a shake of the head? Okay it's Hulk and it's comic, but come on now, this is a farce.Most of the scenes with the Hulk himself are dark, and the killer for most of the fight scenes is that it's too dark and you can't see what's going on. This is really evident when we see him fighting the killer dogs, then again with the final fight against the main creature of the movie.The whole contrived storyline with this creature is bizarre, the fact that it takes on the shapes of things it touches and absorbs but yet only when it suits the story. When it starts changing into rocks and water showing it can't seemingly control itself is bizarre when not two minutes ago it was wearing clothes, walking around and sitting on a seat without ill affect. The whole idea of it turning into water is daft anyway, surely the Hulk would just stand there and just get wet? Again, not that you can see what's going on during these scenes.It deserves a mark for two reasons though. One is the editing and post production work that makes a lot of the scene transitions and framing feel like a comic book, I actually quite liked that as it wasn't totally hiding from the source genre, it was embracing it and making it part of its own. The second is the work earlier on in the movie to build characters and try and focus on the inner angst of Banner, this was a good way to go but unfortunately the writing and the acting is just so two dimensional and weak that it just seems to be wasting yours and the movies time.",Hulk
122,kirk-246,Um...... the sequel was good.,6,28 May 2009,"Don't get me wrong for saying this,but this isn't a bad movie nor an excellent masterpiece.Instead,it's more of an OK movie that's has some value,but not a lot of it.So I recommend that you watch the sequel instead.But since I'm talking about this movie,I going to cut to the chase. This movie tells us about Bruce Banner and his past,especially when his father went psycho and killed Bruce's mom.Many years later,Bruce gets into an experiment that accidentally unleashes the powerful brute inside him.That's the plot and that pretty much sums up the entire movie.So like I said,this is a watchable movie with some decent special effects,but I recommend the sequel,which has more story and more action.Basically,this movie is a solid C plus.Hulk:C+The Incredible Hulk:B+",Hulk
123,supertom-3,"Very underrated, an intelligent and well acted blockbuster!!",8,18 July 2003,"The big green machine is back in this top draw comic book movie. With Ang Lee at the helm this is more than just a smash, bang and wallop of a film you would expect from a Hulk film, but it is played out like a Greek tragedy with the character of the Hulk being very humanized and being a metaphor for something inside us all, its very poignant and thought provoking but many fans and even critics have responded negatively to the attempt at drama, saying they want more smashing. I find this sad because there's a good script there, this film is sorely underrated.The first forty minutes build up to the first appearance of the Hulk and this tended to alienate half the audience, those who just wanted smashing were bored but the others were interested in the development of Banners character and his relationship with Betty, in many ways the film tries to add heart to the tale much like the TV series did. When the Hulk does appear the action junkies woke to see some of the most impressive effects ever seen. The Hulk looks fantastic, all those doubts wiped from peoples minds and the performance of the Hulk is good, much of Eric Bana translates through to the green meanie, and indeed much of the Hulks physical performance is Ang Lee himself. The interaction between Hulk and his environment is amazing too.There of course could have been trimming in the opening hour or so yes but the performances from Eric Bana as Bruce and Jennifer Connelly as Betty were superb. Connelly is particularly good as Betty, it's the natural beauty and the angelic eyes (which are themselves Green, her casting seems almost too perfect)that when she tames the Hulk just from his sighting of her your believe it, the intelligence of the script and the forewarning from the opening forty minutes is particularly resonant, the way in which Betty is intrigued and almost obsessed to find out what is going on in Banners head, why he is so emotionally retarded, it is ironic that in her pursuit to delve inside Banners soul that his inner self (the suppressed rage) is released. The dimensions added to the characters are interesting. As such with the increase in character depth there is a problem with pacing in the movie, particularly for a summer movie. It almost seems like the combination of drama and blockbuster haven't quite gelled together and subsequently Hulk has suffered at the box office, for me I am one of the narrow majority who thinks that it works. There is not enough drama for it to be a drama and not enough bang and smash or one liners for it to be box office fodder.The cast are top draw. Eric Bana continues his prominent rise to A-list Hollywood. The gorgeous Jennifer Connelly is very good but some may argue wasted when compared to her Oscar winning role in Beautiful Mind, but she doesn't have as much screen time here and of course the story takes a step back when the smashing begins. Sam Elliot as Betty's father is also good. Nick Nolte is really chewing up the scenery and plays it dangerously close to the borderline of ham but at time he manages to get a chill down the spine. Of course there is real class behind the camera and combined with the quality of the cast, the dramatic scenes are very good. The cinematography is also superb, this movie is masterfully shot, the desert scenes really look great. ILM have surpassed themselves again and the master of fantastical scores Danny Elfman hits the mark once again. The editing of the movie is very unique and flashy and adds to the comic book element, the use of split screen is on the most part well used and there are some great transition shots, occasionally the art house editing is overused though particularly when the Hulk is on the rampage.Overall this is a worthy take on the Hulk saga and the sequel is an exciting prospect. If you want action then you get it, if you want drama, you get that just not at the same time. I liked the film, very underrated. ****",Hulk
124,theshadow908,The Incredible Flawed Movie,4,5 June 2006,"Hulk tells the story of Dr. Bruce Krenzler (he's been adopted. His biological father is David Banner), a scientist at Berkely Labs working on Gamma radiation, which will help people heal faster and better. One day something goes terribly wrong and he is exposed to deadly amounts of Gamma radiation. To everyone's surprise, he doesn't die, but a strange man who's been lurking around the lab, who just happens to be Bruce's real father, warns him of something that may occur. Whenever Bruce feels threatened or enraged, he mutates into a green behemoth bent on destruction. While this makes for an okay action film, Ang Lee's directing style completely ruins the experience.This movie isn't for fans of the comic book or for fans of the TV show. So much of the story has been changed around that the Hulk doesn't even seem like the same character. Ang Lee took liberties from the character that weren't necessary at all. The entire back story of Bruce's father being a mad scientist that altered his son's DNA with something that the Gamma rays ended up triggering for Bruce to become the Hulk is ridiculous. The entire story is flawed. The other problem is that the movie has a running length of nearly 2 and a half hours, and most of that time is spent up with sappy drama, and not enough action. Basically, Ang Lee went nuts over getting a good story and ended up ruining the film completely. I think the biggest problem is his direction style. He tried to do a good thing by making the movie look like a comic book, but it ended up destroying the experience. His use of distracting and annoying split screens constantly throughout the movie start to get irritating. There is one redeeming quality. The scene where the Hulk breaks out of a military facility and proceeds to destroy tanks and helicopters is a great action sequence that might please fans of the comic. If that was the whole movie, it might get a 9/10 from me. Unfortunately, that's not the case.Not even the acting is very good. Eric Bana is wooden and silly as Bruce Banner, and he just comes off as a bit of an idiot. Jennifer Connelly is also wooden as Banner's love interest Betty Ross. Nick Nolte gives the worst performance of his career in this movie. I almost have to wonder if Nick Nolte was drunk every time he was filming. The only performance I really liked was Josh Lucas as Talbot, the scheming scientist desperate to trap the Hulk for his own agenda.Overall, it was shoddy acting and directing that ruined this film, because with the special effects involved, it had huge potential.4.5/10",Hulk
125,jimmycoffin-751-212853,Before MCU there was good Superhero films,9,15 April 2019,"People just don't get it. This movie portrays the 80s comics and the original aesthetics of hulk very well. The supervillain i just love. How he Molds into everything. Dangerous indeed.
Why? Cause hulks supervillain gallery Is amongst the most bizarre and was Always just like hulk. Hunted percecuted killing machines but still with character dephts. Power is the main theme of Hulk. Nuclear powered beasts.
And you dont have any Silly crappy fights with Thor that wins over hulk. No this movie is very misunderstood. Its just like Akira. Powers so unfathomable that everything just inplodes in the finale. Therefore this movie becomes more scary and adult then the New colorful mcu mainstream that caress the young viewer with the usual cgi comedy canon.
Sure this movie Isn't all perfect.
I still wanted a real fight between hulk and the crazy proffessor. Hulk size vary..and it movie really misses a great vs battle. It has its flaws but its a great movie nonetheless.

126,NoArrow,Nolte steals the show!,10,21 June 2003,"I've never been a huge fan of Nick Nolte, but when I heard he was cast in this movie I was generally happy because every good comic movie needs a character actor in it (i.e.: Walken in 'Batman Returns').  I wasn't expecting to see any fabulous acting in this (aside from Academy Award winning Connelly), and was completely surprised at Nolte's passionate performance.Usually in Super-Hero movies, the villain is just some crazy mofo who kills for fun (i.e.: Nicholson in 'Batman', Farrel in 'Daredevil'), but Nolte's David Banner is a reluctant villain.  He created his 'freakish' son, Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) and has wanted to finish him off since Bruce's childhood, but his 'curiosity' restrained him.When Nolte's David and Bana's Bruce clash at the end, I was entertained to the fullest.  Aside from Nolte's fabulous performance, there are a few flaws.  The CGI Hulk looks fake sometimes, but mostly good.  I'm surprised at the emotion CGI characters are expressing these days, with this film's Hulk and Lord of the Ring's Gollum.The fight scenes are done well too, though Director Ang Lee's fancy way of editing gets a little hard to watch, but still good.Great comic book movie, overall I give it an 8 out 10.",Hulk
127,RiffRaffMcKinley,Cerebral but Distracting With a Slight Touch of Nausea,6,6 October 2007,"Ang Lee's take on ""Hulk"" isn't nearly as bad as you've heard it is, but it isn't very good, either. It attempts to create a different kind of Marvel movie after the good (usually, but mostly similar) fare since 2000's ""X-Men."" The result is a hypnotic mess that elevates in quality simply for the effort given. In fact, the most irritating thing (objectively) about the film is that infernal split-screen use, which makes the film far too frenetic for its own good. The performances here aren't good, but they were better than the worst moments in the ""Spider-Man"" movies. But other than that, it's just an aborted attempt at something with a movie hidden underneath all the layers of moderate bizarrity and its Big Brother ethic. In other words, the only way to purposefully find hidden meaning here would be to dissect the film a la High School English. But in doing so, don't beat it to death. Treat it like a movie, and you'll be a slight bit surprised by its just-above mediocrity.",Hulk

In 'Hulk' there is no -zing-,  despite many kinetic transitions.  There is an expectation of some gratification for patiently sitting through background material.  This movie reminded me of 'Signs"".  I sat there,  knowing this was a summer blockbuster,  which gives the audience expectations that they are going to see some eye popping special effects.  What happens is too little, too late.  Once again an action film has no business clocking in over 2 hours.  I sat in on a matinee,  with a pile of kids.  After the first hour of droll dialogue,  the kids were screaming up and down the aisles.  Someone took our their cell phone and started gabbing out loud.  (He was later persuaded to talk in the lobby).  I frankly didn't blame them.  Remember the seat numbing amount of time before we got to see the goods in 'Pearl Harbor'?   The action finally comes in one big spurt,  and even so,  quickly shifts back into Park.   It's like waiting two hours in line to ride a fancy roller coaster, and it's over in like a minute.

129,SonicStuart,One of the Worst Superhero Movies Ever!,2,16 September 2008,"HulkStarring: Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Sam Elliot, Josh Lucas and Nick NolteGenre: Action/Sci-Fi/ThrillerRated PG-13When I was 14 I really liked this movie, but then a few years later I watch this movie again and finally opened my eyes and realized that this movie sucks! Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of movies based on Marvel comic books but this is one is the worst one that has been made. First off, they took too long to show us how Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) became The Hulk, it took like almost an hour of the movie. Also the special effects were terrible, The Hulk was way too green to the point where it looks like a ticked off Shrek than The Hulk. The rest of the time in the movie Thunderbolt Ross (Sam Elliot) is hunting down the Hulk while on his rampage. Here's another thing that they did wrong, the more people shoot at the Hulk he keeps getting bigger and they didn't do that in the comics and I thought they also choose a very lame villain that just absorbs anything like lightning, water, rocks or whatever. Plus this movie was just too long. I feel sorry for a good actor like Eric Bana to good through this terrible movie, personally if I think Eric Bana would've been better in Daredevil or Ghost Rider which were 2 Marvel movies that auditioned for but lost out. Another thing they did wrong was the setting, most Marvel superhero settings (except for Silver Surfer and Thor) are in New York City including The Hulk and they put the setting in San Francisco. Ang Lee is one director that should have never even bother doing this movie when he knew he was going to miss it up in some way, shape or form. This movie sucks!",Hulk

131,PoisonKeyblade,Dreadful,1,20 December 2006,"In all honesty, I was anxiously awaiting The Hulk when I first heard of it. I thought it could end up being equally as good as Spider-Man and the Batman films. The cast looked decent, and so did the special effects, but The Hulk just plain did not deliver.One of The Hulk's problems is his powers. The character doesn't get his powers until the last half of the film, and even then, nothing really all that spectacular happens. In the last act of the film when his father comes into play and gains his own powers, the movie becomes cheesy and horrible.There is also, strangely enough, little-to-no character development, even though most of the movie is concentrated on the characters. You never feel attached to a single person in the entire span of the movie, and the extra things thrown in that reveal pieces of Hulk's past are mediocre and unnecessary; well, unnecessary in the fashion that they carry the events out.The only reason this movie gets a 1/10 rather than a 0/10 is because of its amazing special effects. The Hulk himself looks great, although the actor who plays him gets increasingly annoying as the film moves on. The dogs look cool, and so does everything else, but the movie itself is utter garbage.The Hulk certainly had potential, but delivered nothing special. It seemed as if they tried to fit as much about the character as possible in a single film, like they just grabbed some things from comic books and just threw them together.

132,bix171,Upsides And Downsides,7,18 July 2003,"Ang Lee attempt to create a brooding melodrama while trying to stay true to the live-action comic genre generally works but, typical of Lee's work, there's a lack of depth that renders everything static and half-formed. It tries to be soulful but ends up humorless and blurry. On the upside, Lee is probably more successful than anyone has been in actually recreating the kinetic rush and intensity of comic-book art: he moves a number of multi-panels of shifting sizes on and off the screen; he freezes various shots, giving them a drawn look; and he ingeniously uses depth of vision in the action scenes (often to humorous effect: a tank thrown like a discus crashes with a poof in the background). On the downside, Lee and longtime collaborator, writer James Shamus, aren't sure how they perceive their subject. They position Hulk as the rage-filled opposite of mild-mannered hero Bruce Banner (Eric Bana, the Australian actor whose obvious attempts to hide his accent actually adds to his intensity), who claims to enjoy the mass destruction; yet he becomes the monster only as an act of self-defense and only seeks to protect himself. They also take their own sweet time on developing the relationship between Banner and his scientist father (Nick Nolte, delivering a lazy, shapeless performance) with too much of it told in flashback; it ends up indistinct and unresolved. (Lee and Schamus also try, late in the film, to make a supervillian out of Nolte but they jettison that idea almost as quickly as they introduce it.) Still, though there could have been more of the effective computer effects designed to highlight the various emotions displayed on Hulk's face, it's pretty well made, an attempt to provide an adult perspective that goes beyond the usual sophisticated production design and yet provide reasonable entertainment value--it may not be the righteous effort Lee is striving for but it's not without its pleasures.",Hulk
133,Dockelektro,How do you force a concept into submission?,7,21 July 2003,"Force? Submission? Well, let me explain. Movies are a lot different from comics, and presently there isn't room to make a comic adaptation into a movie without recurring to known formulas or marching into a too many times charted territory. At the time of release of this picture, the Batman, X-Men, Daredevil, Spawn, Superman and many other adaptations have been released, some with success, some without, some needing to be revived, some needing to be killed once and for all. And also, The Hulk is probably one of the most difficult characters to adapt to movies because his powers rely on strength and destruction, not on fly-bys, jumps, athletic qualities and state-of-the-art machinery. So how could Ang Lee pull this off? Frankly, you need some particular vision and flare to turn a movie about a beastly man into a thrilling ride, and even so, you'll have to dedicate a lot of time to the characters and the main story to be able to unleash hell in the second half without turning the movie into a caotic festival of mayhem. So Ang Lee tries in every shot to state the point that he wants this one to be different. And indeed, as he splits the screen in tens of separate vignettes, when he makes transitions that look like a panoramic shot over a comic book page, and when the story (in a frankly innovative move) puts allies and enemies in such a close, almost familial relationship, the result must really be different. But is it good afterall? Well, it's really a set-piece creator, jointing pictures and concepts that, while no landmarks in the history of movies, are eye candy to the max. But there are some strange things going around in this obsession with making this one so unique - the split screen option is funny at start, but then it is just another baroque gimmick. The actors are no stand-outs, and even the staring Eric Bana doesn't look like he's really inside the complex emotions his character experiments. Nick Nolte is probably the best, in a wicked creation that generates at the same time empathy and repugnance. But it's great fun and as a popcorn ride is above average - the Hulk sequences in the desert and the final showdown are at some points jaw-dropping. But don't look to closely or you will find that all that green skin can at some point turn into normal fare again - and is not for watching Bruce Banner that we came into the theatre in the first place.",Hulk
134,mnpollio,Dreadful,2,20 June 2007,"Art house favorite/critical darling Ang Lee takes a stab at a mainstream comic book action film and the results are horrendous. Unless one has existed under a rock, there are few unfamiliar with the comic book tale of scientist Bruce Banner, whose failed experiments inadvertently produce the side effect of a huge green destroyer that emerges every time he gets angry. Admittedly, Hulk is not the typical comic book hero, but that is also not to say that an enjoyable film could not be made about the character. Unfortunately, Lee becomes so desperate to make his film ""stand out"" and be taken seriously that the end result is pretentious, tedious, and silly - often all at the same time. The plot is a mishmash of the comic book origins mixed in with new filler that goes no where. Ironically, for all of the fans scoffing that the Hulk looked like Gumby-on-steroids in the previews, the creature is one of the few things that work within the context of the film. It is believable and the film comes slightly to life when it does make an appearance, which is sadly all too infrequently. Lee uses visual gimmicks in order to make the film look like a comic book come to life, but it becomes tiresome quick and this was done to better effect more than 20 years ago in Creepshow. Much of the film's problem is that for a comic book action film, there is really no central villain or anyone worthwhile to root against. Instead, it divides the villainous duties up among three less-than-stellar characters. Josh Lucas and Sam Elliott grit their teeth, bug their eyes out and flail around in a misguided attempt to appear menacing, but only look like they want to wring their respective agent's necks. Indeed, the final shot of Lucas' character in the film will no doubt provide more snickers than satisfaction. Nick Nolte wanders in and out periodically playing Banner's apparently evil father whose motivations seem to change with every turn of the page in the script, thus his performance alternates between dazed and something that appears to be light years beyond camp. Eric Bana is thoroughly miscast as Banner. Buff and sporting a leading man's good looks, Bana is not remotely convincing as a science geek and apparently has mistaken lifeless for repressed. His Banner is so stiff and un-exciting that he can almost be mistaken for a prop. However, he is a veritable whirlwind compared to Jennifer Connelly, who seems to be suffering from narcolepsy. She stumbles through the film demonstrating all the emotion of a cadaver and periodically cries a tear from one eye when it all gets to be too much for her. As such, the leads have a non-existent on-screen chemistry, which renders the romance portion of the story null and void. Worse, Lee has no handle on how to choreograph or direct action sequences. The fight between Hulk and the Hulk Dogs (don't ask!) is dark and half-hearted. And if someone can make heads or tails out of the nonsense conclusion, featuring a visually chaotic and incoherent showdown between Bana and Nolte, then more power to you! A dismal mess that is solemn to the nth degree.",Hulk

136,dasa108,The best modern Hulk movie,7,22 October 2021,"Ang Lee is a great director. And great directors make great movies. In this case we have an extraordinary film that develops characters, adds intensity to the plot, explains everything we see in a satisfactory way, has great actors and dares to use the aesthetics of the comic to make us enjoy the experience. Maybe the villain could have been better but in a sense it is more of an inner journey of the protagonist (he has problems with his father, problems with his girlfriend, problems with a potential father-in-law, problems with a sentimental competitor) but in any case he does not stop have courage. It is a good movie and unfortunately Marvel has not dared to make good cinema with its characters by inviting renowned directors. It is a pity.",Hulk
137,jpintar,Good,8,20 June 2003,"I really liked this movie.  It is not as good as the classic comic book movies like Superman I and II, X-Men I and II, Batman, or Spiderman.  I thought the acting in the movie, particularly Jennifer Connelly and Nick Nolte, are very good.  However, the movie takes a little too much time with the backstory.  At about 2 1/2 hours, the film is too long.  As for the CGI Hulk, I liked it.  It looks like the Hulk came from the comic book.  He is supposed to be about 9 feet tall and CGI was the only way to show the Hulk realistically.  I will see it again to see what I missed the first time. Overall, a good movie but no classic.",Hulk
138,moviewiz-4,Very bad indeed,5,30 July 2003,"This movie looks all right at first as we see the huge big guy with creepy eyes staring at us (the audience) but, when comparing the television version with this, well, too bad that the TV's version is much more better. First, the creature at the movie was original and from human transformation. Secondly, the tune/music/theme are so sentimental/touching it gives us the feeling that this is a tragedy.Now, the movie version has more action on it. How can a guy can be that big and that green and that funny. It(His) face expression in the movie is very ridiculous and funny. He(It) looks Fat!Maybe the same old Tv style can be reproduced again with a better story.",Hulk
139,ApolloBoy109,"Awful. Crying, screaming awful, chillingly bad!!",1,26 October 2005,"I have commented on Mr. Ang Lee before and at the risk of repeating myself I cry out in anguish at Ang's career - - why? Does no one in Hollywood ever stop to consider the American Experience. How can someone born and raised in a world so completely not America continuously be hired to director very American-related stories. Ice Storm sucked, it was someones version of a soap opera, the way in which it was directed. Run with the Devil was so unAmerican in its style and direction, no wonder it sank at the box office. Now comes The Hulk, what a pathetic waste of film. The screen play made little sense in the way in which the story unfolded. The whole new angle stunk to high heaven. This was not the very American experience I grew up with -- being a big fan of the Hulk since I was able to read -- I was shocked at how very different the source material was from the final out come. Between over complicating the tale, the mad scientist, the death of the mother, the whack job scientist, the General and so on and so on. God it was so horrible and that ending! So Lee has now screwed up the Civil War, Mid-70s lifestyles, Superheros and his next film is one of my favorite gay cowboy stories. Brokeback Mountain. Since this is second movie concerning gay men (i.e. the Wedding Banquet) perhaps he will get this one right. I am hoping. I not being mean or racist. I loved Crouching Tiger, Hidden Metaphor -- It was awesome but it was in his realm of understanding.",Hulk
140,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"very disappointing, but it does have cool effects and good performances",6,27 July 2006,"Hulk is poorly directed. I know it. You know it. Ang Lee knows it. However, while the direction nearly destroys the film, the performances of Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, and Nick Nolte are the saviors of the film. Bana is great as the ferocious green brute, catching every emotion that is required playing the most complex character in the Marvel universe...well The Punisher's up there too, but whatever. Connelly as Betty Ross is a good move, and the Oscar winner does not mess up. She is extremely likable as the love interest of Bruce Banner, more likable then Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson, Katie Holmes' Rachel Dawes, or Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane. Nick Nolte as the father to Bruce (simply credited as the greatest credit ever: father) is bone chilling and creepy. He plays a wonderful David Banner in this film, and he becomes a classic villain in the film (no spoilers here). What really drags this film down is the cheesy music, crappy direction, and crappier writing. Be forewarned that the Hulk will not appear until about 45 minutes into the film, and before he appears, you'll feel extremely bored. In Spider-Man, you only had to wait about 7 minutes for Peter to get his powers, then about another 20 until he became Spider-Man. Daredevil is already born in the beginning of the film, and the Fantastic Four are created within minutes of the film's commencement. Hulk is a waste of time for the average moviegoer unless one is a comic lover or an action lover, because the action is pretty good. I liked the scenes where Hulk races away from the military, especially the ones in the desert. Bana and Connelly have great chemistry in the film, but sadly the terrible writing and direction, not to mention poor decision making overshadow this and a chilling performance from Nick Nolte.6/10 --spy",Hulk
141,tributarystu,"Me Hulk, Me Angry-For Heaven's Sake!",6,5 September 2003,"I was actually against writing a review for the little Hulk, but I change my mind considering the fact that I haven't written a review on a movie for which I have similar feelings. I'm talking about another super-hero based film, Spider-Man. I was so disappointed to see Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man as I was to see Jennifer Connelly in this. You know, all super-hero movies, or almost all, are the same. You've seen one you've seen them all one might say. Can't disagree. Of course, X-Men 2 was a great surprise, but I doubt Spidey 2 or a rumored Hulk 2 will also be.This thing of a movie is actually pathetic when it comes to theory. It would've been great if there would've been less talking and more action. Actually it was just enough action. Stick just with the ""less talking"" part. Every sentence that came from any of the actors seemed such a cliche. The action was pretty good though, nice effects and all, but that doesn't make a good movie. The story is largely predictable and I advise you to go to the movie with a friend you haven't spoken with for a long time. If you do so you can easily catch up with what's been happening during the ""talking frames"". This movie doesn't have any charm and even though the beginning was quite interesting it all went to hell once the character know as Bruce's dad appeared. He is really uninteresting and pathetic. Exactly as the father-general. Two characters will lack any depth. Even though it's over two hours of material you hardly get to see a solidly built character. There were a lot of scenes in which the screen was split; reminded me of a game, but my friend told me a smart thing: looks like a comic book. Actually it did. Nice effect? Hard to say. Didn't bring anything enchanting in the movie. The most laughable scene, visually, was the one in which Talbot died, being out rendered in a blow-up scene. Sorry, not for me.A solid 6, if not a 5.5. Not much of a good movie, but still better than Charlie's Angels:Full Throttle. I don't know to whom to recommend it. Probably only to the people who've been waiting for it. And I guess those have already seen it.",Hulk
142,mardalsfossen01,Unfortunately mostly boring,6,4 January 2019,"I think the 2003 Hulk has artistic value. Not only the split screens which resemble panels of a comic book were a good approach, but also the different camera angles & shots which capture details. Also showing which thoughts the different characters have was a nice addition, but sometimes too dragging for an Action movie.
The first half felt almost relaxing and soothing, I think it's good they showed more than just blatant action.
I also felt in love with the music score by Danny Elfman.
To compensate, there's action when Hulk shows and I think the CGI is good, there wasn't a moment where I cringed due to it in the important sequences.
But, if I was someone who went to the movies in 2003, what was there ? LOTR: Return Of The King, Matrix: Reloaded, Pirates Of The Caribbean, Kill Bill Vol. 1. Compared to these movies and more, Hulk is unfortunately very boring.
'Hulk' feels like an older movie but with CGI added and even if the movie has an artistic atmosphere and good pictures in it, it also puts you to sleep.",Hulk
143,TheHande,"A Stylistic, Dark Story",10,22 July 2006,"The Hulk isn't really a super-hero movie, since the Hulk can't really be classified as either a super-hero or -villain. He's just super-human. As such I feel the reason some people didn't like this film came from the reason that Hulk didn't duke it out with another spandex-wearing hero from Marvel, like Captain America. But that's just it, Hulk is not a super-hero, his story has less to do with epic battles than it does with an idea. The Hulk is an allegory for uncontrolled rage.This is why I love the film. It's very human, very real in spite of its fantasy origins. The Hulk is something magnificent, yet at the same time something very human and tragic. The film has a weird Zen feel to it which may be due to director Ang Lee. Also the narrative, with its comic-book like cuts does manage to capture the feel of a comic-book quite well.Though the performances at the very beginning of the film were not as impressive as those later in the film, everything in the film is luckily so grounded that it didn't bother me that much. What it manages to do is capture the essence of what The Hulk is about. This is why I like it very much the same way I liked X-Men and why I disliked Spider-Man.This is easily the most mature and perhaps the best comic-book movie ever made.",Hulk
144,fjhuerta-2,"Like asking for a bacon cheeseburger, and getting caviar instead.",3,28 June 2003,"The Hulk.Ah, where to start. Is it a good movie? Who knows? I'm serious. It's supposed to be an action comic, or something. Yet Ang Lee chose to give us something else - I'd say he tried to tell us the background story of what the Hulk stands for. If ""Batman"" had been such a film, I guess we would have seen 1.5 hours of Wayne's parents raising him up, and then being killed on a dark alley.On the other hand, not even Lee's direction can change the fact that Hulk is, for the lack of a better concept, a two dimensional character on a one dimensional world (a comic book). No matter how hard he tries, the fact remains - the story, known to almost every single person going to the theatre, is completely linear. Meaning, once you see the movie, there's nothing else left to see. Ergo, no replay value whatsoever.Besides, somebody should tell him the special effects are, in fact, third rate ones.  The battle between Hulk and the 4 crazed dogs is completely laughable - the dogs look like Milo, Jim Carrey's dog in ""The Mask"", which is to say, cartoon like. No wonder so many battles take place at night; I guess the SFX guys were trying to hide the fact that they didn't try too hard in the first place All in all, my friends didn't leave the theatre because they fell asleep on their chair, and now they hate me for having taken them to watch the movie. They were expecting ""The Hulk"" - instead, we all got something like a serious movie, but with no real substance underneath.It's not a *bad* movie - it's just that it's not what it's supposed to be.
I guess that makes it sort of a failure.",Hulk
145,rparham,Falls a little short,7,12 October 2003,"From a cursory evaluation of the talent involved, Hulk appears to be the most interesting and unique comic book adaption yet to be brought to the silver screen.  Director Ang Lee has just come off a career high with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Jennifer Connelly is also flying high from an Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress for A Beautiful Mind.  Add in Nick Nolte and the red hot Marvel comics franchise, Hulk would appear to be a winner from all avenues.  What emerges, though hardly poor, is somewhat underwhelming, and lacking in the very thing some critics have praised the film for, emotional depth.Most people are familiar with the outlines of this story, in many cases simply because of the late 1970's television series starring Lou Ferrigno (who makes a cameo here, along with famous Marvel editor-in-chief Stan Lee) as the green goliath.  Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a man who has some trouble with rage, and after an accident in his laboratory involving nanobots and gamma radiation, his rage is now manifested in a transformation into a walking giant, green skinned and ranging between nine and fourteen feet tall.  The creature is all rage, and can only be tempered by Bruce's feelings for his former girlfriend and fellow scientist, Betty Ross (Connelly).  The situation is made complicated by a number of factors: Betty's friend Glenn Talbot(Josh Lucas) who is interested in Bruce and her research for military purposes, her father General Ross (Sam Elliot), Talbot's superior, who is suspicious of Bruce because of his past dealings with Bruce's father, David Banner (Nick Nolte).  But Bruce's father proves the be the greatest complication of all, wondering back into his life from nowhere, and with motives that seem less than pure.Hulk is definitely the most different of the modern comic adaptations.  It is not just a popcorn flick, although it has many of the attributes of one. It contains the requisite action scenes and elaborate special effects, but the film has an art house soul.  It seems to be interested mostly in the characters and the effects of the story on them.  But yet, at the same time, it can't seem to quite accomplish this to a satisfactory end.  Perhaps it is because the film is about emotionally stunted characters (both Bruce and Betty are victims of a form of mental and emotional child abuse, if not physical) that the narrative fails to grab your emotions and get you involved in the character's plight. The scenes between the leads feel somewhat cold, leaving you without a center to grasp hold of in the picture.It doesn't help that the plot isn't exactly a tightly wound, carefully constructed piece either. The main story, concerning experiments that David Banner performed on himself and passed on to his son, is inadequately explained.  More than once during the film, I found myself unsure of the details, leaving me scratching my head as to what was trying to be resolved. Also, the dialogue at times seems to resemble stilted 1960's comic writing more than any other recent adaptation, with melodramatic lines that are overplayed by the actors, such as a scene where General Ross confronts David Banner with such lines as ""Human experimentation is just to dangerous! You are playing with nature!"" Scenes such as this pull you out of the film and make it seem more like a comic book adaptation and less like a story about real characters.Ang Lee and editor Tim Squyres have added one interesting visual trick to the film, assembling scenes with split-screen techniques and comic book style panels which make the film seem as if it is a filmed, moving comic book.  This works at times, such as when the technique is employed to show two different characters reactions to developments when in a normal camera set-up only one could be displayed, but it also proves distracting at times when the individual pieces seem to be even in their importance and we are left unsure which to focus on.No element garnered more criticism than the use of computer generated imagery to realize the Hulk.  I, for one, think that the work is exceptional, although not without flaws, and find myself wondering what people really are looking for when complaining about the Hulk.  Would a six-foot-five man, or even a seven-foot man, have served the story as well as a nine-foot to fourteen-foot behemoth, especially in scenes where visual effects would have been required no matter what? The work is not perfect, but it does push the envelope, and what would have happened had Steven Spielberg and James Cameron not pushed the envelope a decade ago (although some would question that they should have, but that is for another discussion).In the end, Hulk proves to be a film with great promise that falls short of fulfilling it's mission.  There is a lot to like here, and credit must be given to the filmmakers for being willing to push the comic book adaptation in new directions, but it doesn't quite add up to a success.",Hulk
146,Ziya90,"Each time, makes me proud",10,11 January 2010,"Hulk is a very long movie, 138 minutes. Therefore, subtract 40 minutes, approx. 98 minutes are left behind that makes a movie. The first forty minutes of the movie was seriously criticized like there is no action in the first forty minutes, the first forty minutes are dull. This forty minutes are neither boring, nor uninteresting, in contrast exhausting because of Ang Lee's very fast editing. This is exhausting, but also raises the bar of the movie to me. And the first mutation rocks. Ang Lee is like a detail expert, one of the most detailed (so perfectionist) set decorations it has, there are a few unnecessary split screen shots but not important, the scene is great. Always, the first is the most important, so Lee gets through without any flaw. By the way, the accident that was criticized either is shocking. It seems mild, but it was 'silent and deep' and even tragic. Generally, the editing in Hulk is a revolution in super hero movies, there are countless amazing moments owing to editing. For example, Hulk throws a missile at a helicopter and no cut. The only action scene I did not like but extremely long is the scene Hulk fights the 'friends' of his father, because the idea was bad and the visual effects were flawed, but except this scene, the visual effects are flawless, the mutation moments are flawless. In the second movie, when Banner starts to mutate, they make it obscure, if you have seen it, you remember. For example, remember the gas bombs, why? In this movie, we see every bit of mutation which is just great. And Yes, no action in the first forty minutes, but Lee narrows the gap. It is very ironic that there are much more action scenes in Hulk than The Incredible Hulk. Besides the mentioned scenes, the last FORTY minutes are non stop action. This is really ironic. Hulk looks incredible, very green, very muscled, very big and very angry as he should be. Lee did not forget even his always purple shorts. Moreover, this Hulk is smarter than the second one, he does not shout like ''Hulk smash!'' or does not get angry with thunderclap, he is aware of everything, the other Hulk was not conscious except recognizing Betty. Yes, his jumps are very exaggerating, but who cares? May be, his face looks cute in some moments which is bad. Sam Elliot. It is cliché, but he was made for this role, I think, General Ross. He does not imitate Ross, he becomes Ross. People was praising Simmons in Spider-Man movies, it is nothing in comparison with this. Eliiot's character is not cartoonish and his performance is stark, thus perfect. I prefer Eric Bana as Bruce Banner, despite I like Edward Norton, because he was too 'good tempered' for this role. There is a secret enemy who recalls T-1000 in The Terminator 2, it might be a reference who knows and the movie becomes more astonishing and more powerful. As said, the last forty minutes are non stop action, a few split screen moments are far fetched, some of them are brilliant, but brilliant action scenes. The helicopter part is a victory. And I like thousands of mini explosives are released. However, this is just the introduction and development in terms of action and we see the most astonishing action sequence of the movie in the final part (or should I say the most astonishing final phenomenon in comic book adaptations history?) It was like a hidden, astonishing reward after all those. How many super hero movies did such a thing? Almost none. Very enjoyable, also very smart movie.",Hulk
147,gritfrombray-1,Good Marvel stuff,8,10 March 2007,"Really never understand why people give this film so much stick. It was fairly true to the original story of how the Hulk came to be. Bruce Banner, Eric Bana was well suited to the part and Jennifer Connelly was good too. Not altogether happy with this 'genetic manipulation' story involving Bruce Banner's father. I've read the original comic book story and this didn't happen in it. The mutant dogs were crap as well. But, the Hulk himself was awesome. His power, strength and ability to leap great distances were very accurate to the original Hulk. It'll be a big let down if Eric Bana does not reprise the role in the next Hulk movie. With all that said, a good film in all with a good formula for more films to come.",Hulk

We get a very detailed back story and by the end of the movie it feels like we know him.Eric Bana was good as Bruce Banner. But enough about him lets get to the real star of the show.

151,BigGuy,Mixed reaction,7,20 June 2003,"I have very mixed feeling after having seen the Hulk.  As background, I have never read the comics, but watched the TV show as a kid.One thing that is definite is that the movie payed tribute to its comicbook heritage.  A lot of editing (split frames) reflected this.  To me it was more of a distraction, especially the first time it happened.  Some people might like it though.Also the origins of the hulk were different than I remembered from the TV show and what I know of the comic book.  I suppose that is inevitable because the Hulk originated in the 60's and not in modern day, but sticklers will not like it.There were a few fight scenes in the movie that were incredible.  I won't give away all of the opponents, but one of them is the military as featured heavily in the trailers.  My only objection to these is that the Hulk appeared a bit too cartoony.  Not comic book, but cartoon, as if the Hulk were covered in a rubber suit.Overall I did enjoy the movie, and would give it 7/10",Hulk
152,cshep,Terrific Directing by Ang Lee but Disappointing CG Character makes for a Semi-Worthy Effort !!!,6,3 February 2005,"The ""Hulk"" has set the BAR on CG Characters mixed with a LIVE action format, unfortunately , not high enough !!! Ang Lee does more than a credible effort to salvage, what could have been an extraordinary fantasy action film !!! Done with some inserted comic book panels, that really adds to the theme. Ang Lee keeps the story of our tragic hero, mixed with a subplot of embroidered romance , infused with a sicko,(Talbot), and an angry father,(General Ross) balanced, but with a slow start, the Hulk does not appear until 45 minutes into the film. Terrific camera work takes you into the world of the ""Hulk"", when he leaps and floats in the air. Where the story differentiates from the original comic book is an unbalanced father(Nick Nolte), and the Gamma Rays, which originally came from a nuclear explosion, and not a scientific experiment. From what I observed, the Hulk suffers from the 3 Stooges syndrome, women do NOT connect with the character as most adults, which would account for the HUGE drop off at the box office. Most comic book aficionados will appreciate the films effort. Bana, Connelly, Lucas, and Elliot all give good performances.Bruce Banner(Eric Bana) is a research scientist, who works with former girlfriend Betty Ross(Jennifer Connelly), on projects which would benefit humanity by creating a quick healing process. Well , the government is also interested and Talbot(Josh Lucas) has plans to take control of the work. Banner is accidentally exposed to Gamma Radiation , due to an equipment malfunction, and triggers an internal chemistry reaction , combined with his father's genetically transferred DNA and injections when he was a child, that enable him to turn into the Hulk when he gets enraged, this would be terrific during rush hour. So it goes the U.S. Military wants to acquire the Hulk for research purposes, but controlling the Hulk is not as easy task. David Banner(Nick Nolte) is a creepy father figure, and former military scientist who was locked away because of misguided experiments. The term dysfunctional family reaches a new level !!!Danny Elfman infuses oriental music and themes which help give the film a deeper feel, but not deep enough...The Hulk battles his own confused feelings, takes on the military , some nasty mutant dogs, San Francisco, and his father who has delusions of grandeur !!!.The end of the film leaves room for a sequel, why not, it is a comic book.Unfortunately the illustrators who originally gave the Hulk his much needed comic book history boost, are once again given 3rd class status.The overrated Stan Lee gets way TOO much credit, while Kirby and Ditko are almost COMPLETELY snubbed, not even an insert or picture to give them credit in the film format. Shame on them, Stan Lee's tombstone will read , without Kirby and Ditko, I would never know what real talent is.Anyway, if you enjoy fantasy movies, with a disappointing CG film hero,then see the ""HULK"", a very well crafted film, maybe the evolution of CG will improve for a sequel. I gave the film a 7, for direction and vision, but a distant and disappointing CG character brings the film down!!!",Hulk
153,mr_popcorn,"McCheesy's take on ""Hulk""",7,3 July 2008,"This has got to be the most boring superhero film ever released. If we're talking about superhero flicks, then your mindset has got to be loud, raunchy, wild and extreme. It must be loaded with fight scenes and sugar coated with CGI effects. But this one, serious director Ang Lee took Hulk somewhere else, he turned it into a drama and it was way too serious for a superhero film. Of course in every film there must be a content, its not all action there must be some dialog in it but this one, they completely forgot that this is a film that will fuel your adrenal glands. I was half-asleep going into the mid parts.The performance was quite alright. Eric Bana captured Bruce Banner from the comics and he successfully transitioned it into the big screen. I have no qualms with Jennifer Connelly. She was an effective leading lady. Nick Nolte though, he was stellar. He stole the show near the end with his crazy monologue with Bruce near the end.I'm having problems with the ending. I didn't quite get how Nick Nolte's character died. It was all too fast and before you know it, you got Bruce Banner transforming into The Hulk somewhere in the jungles of South America.The Hulk is boring. There were a couple of standout action scenes but that's it. I went in expecting high wire action scenes and I ended up with some melodramatic emotional melancholic crap.",Hulk

The special feature of this movie remind me of Spider-Man (2002) because they have two disc like one for playing the movie and the other one for special feature. It's still a good film.,Hulk
155,ilovedolby,The final result is one of great filmmaking that is quite possibly one of the best comic adaptations in the history of motion pictures.,9,27 June 2003,"Movie adaptations of classic comic books are more common place than ever these days. Be it the fun `Spider-Man' that broke box-office records in its first opening weekend, or the atrocious `Daredevil' that starred the once good actor, Ben Affleck, comic adapted films are becoming somewhat of a cliché. The real trick is to make the film seem original by portraying the main character as troubled, but also noble and powerful. This was exactly what director Ang Lee did for the new film `The Hulk.' By using a split screen technique, outstanding actors and awesome visual effects, Lee makes `The Hulk' transcend the comic by making the audience feel as if they are viewing the comic on the screen. The final result is one of great filmmaking that is quite possibly one of the best comic adaptations in the history of motion pictures. 	`The Hulk' is the story of a scientist named Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) who is exposed to radiation during an experiment that triggers a destructive element in his body. Bruce inherited this element from his father (Nick Nolte) who was a scientist with the military in the 1960s that was working on a gene to create a super-human. When his father's project is abandoned by the military, he injects the genetic substance into his body and passes it off to his newborn son. Now in the present, Bruce is becoming ever more troubled by the strange occurrences in his body. When faced with extreme emotional distress, Bruce transforms into a green giant seeking revenge on anyone who harms him or his beloved former girlfriend, Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). It's now up to the military to try to stop the hulk before he harms himself, or anyone else. 	Director Lee is well known for his more art-house films such as `Sense Sensibility,' `The Ice Storm' and the classic `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.' It was quite a surprise to see his name pushing the release of `The Hulk'-the trailers made it seem as if it were going to be a no-brainer, unlike Lee's usual brand of filmmaking. However, there were telltale signs that `The Hulk' could be quite good. For one, Lee was directing. Two, a superb cast of actors like Eric Bana (`Black Hawk Down'), Jennifer Connelly (`A Beautiful Mind'), Nick Nolte (`Affliction') and Sam Elliot (`The Contender'). Lee's direction is masterful on this film; he doesn't blow the show over the top with non-stop action sequences or absurd one-liners.	The best part about `The Hulk' was the way that Lee presented the story on the screen. He used a technique of splitting the screen into various segments that make the viewer feel as if they are looking at a comic on screen. For example, a small box on the screen may have the shot of a troubled Elliot who plays a general trying to stop the hulk. At the same time, we see the hulk rampaging through a building that he's being held in. It goes to show that Lee can take a completely commercial film and give it a real creative touch. 	All in all, `The Hulk' is flat out great. It's a summer blockbuster that actually should be a model for other summer films that just have rehashed plots, poor acting, and only grab attention by throwing action and visual effects at the audience. What's more, `The Hulk' is truly one the best comic adapted films in the genre. It can proudly take its place among other noteworthy graphic novel adaptations such as Tim Burton's `Batman,' or `The Crow.' ***1/2",Hulk
156,moviedude1,Not as exciting as expected,4,20 July 2003,"A strong supporting cast that featured a lot of my favorite actors over the years (Connelly, Elliott, Nolte) could not hold my interest in this movie. The special effects, on the other hand, did!The split screen images that would show all the people/things affected by the events happening in the movie were good.  And I understand the need to set the plot up by showing the movie as they did, but, overall, if you are going to see this movie to watch the Hulk smash things, prepared to be bored for the first half of the film.  I used to collect Marvel comics as a kid and this was one of them.  For the Hulk to span the ages and enter the new millenium as it did was wonderful.  But, overall, I think this movie was a dud.  The first thing I ask myself when I have seen a movie is, ""Would I pay again to watch it?""  No way!  This movie doesn't rate anything over a four!",Hulk
157,ryan_kuhn,"""You're Making Me Angry!""",5,13 February 2005,"The comic book rebirth in the movies was in full swing when this Marvel Comic book-inspired movie came out in 2003. Hulk (not The Hulk, as many people mistakingly called it, shame on you all) is directed by Ang Lee, who's most well known movie before was Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, gives Hulk a visual style similar to comic books, as often, the screen is divided up into rectangular cells, much like you would see in a comic book. The look of the film is really good, I liked the different cells showing different aspects of the action, but some people found it distracting. The parts of the film I didn't like was how long some of the fight sequences were. After about 10 minutes, we got the idea that a big green giant can smack around genetically altered dogs, but not destroy them. But the fights go on and on and on. The story kind of gets bogged down in clichés and the absurd. Eric Bana plays a genetics researcher as some university where Lou Ferrigno is a security guard and works with love interest Jennifer Connelly. While working late on night (it always happens late at night, doesn't it?) Bana's character Bruce Banner is hit with lots and lots of radiation, changing his DNA or something like that and turns him into mild-mannered Bruce by day, and a big green giant with an anger problem when he gets upset. Nick Nolte plays Banner's father, who looks like a DUI mugshot and is a puzzling character. We aren't sure if he's a good guy or a bad guy, and by the end, we really do not care. The special effects look good, a bouncing ball of a mass of green giants looks real as the Hulk jumps off one mountain to another. The military is of course portrayed as stupid and unimaginative, firing thousands of bullets at the Hulk, not one doing anything to him. By the end of the movie, we feel like we've been on a long car ride, only to find out we were stuck in traffic for most of it. Lots of time was spent, but the plot does not move forward very fast. The last scene of the movie is a hint that there may be a sequel on the way, though with the dismal box office numbers with this film, odds are low that we will see Hulk, Revenge (remember, the word ""the"" is not allowed)",Hulk
158,MF210,"I admire the style of the movie, but it moved way too slow",6,5 September 2003,"My Rating: **1/2When I saw The Hulk, I really thought I would get another comic book action movie. But I didn't, I got a really stylish comic book movie. It is a movie I would be able to admire and enjoy, but unfortunately the movie had a really sluggish pace in areas. That is why my rating of The Hulk is not higher. The Hulk is better acted than most comic book movies. Eric Bana was good as Bruce Banner. Jennifer Connely was also good as Betty Ross, Banners love interest. However, Nick Nolte is the best and worth seeing the movie alone for, he plays the crazy father (of bruce) extremely well.
The Hulk's special effects are not as bad as I thought they would be. They do look downright cheesy in the desert and a lab but the scenes in San Francisco, the Dog Fight and at the end are very well done. The movie does have some memorable scenes. Director Ang Lee used the Split-Screen Technique to make the Hulk look like a page of a comic book. It works really well. Although there was one point where it may have been overdone but for the most part it worked very well. This will separate The Hulk from the rest of the comic book movies.
The problem with the movie as it says in the first paragraph is the sluggish pace. Some of the action scenes even get a little boring, especially the ones in the desert. Its true The Hulk is a more complex story to tell than say, Spiderman. But it was impossible for me to give it a higher rating because it was just so sluggish that at one point I wanted to go to the bathroom so maybe when I come back it would move FASTER.
Alll this said, The Hulk does have admirable qualities like I mentioned. Maybe I will watch it again on DVD. It might be possible I wasnt in the mood for it.",Hulk
159,vailsy,Incredibly Underrated,9,13 April 2007,"i just do not see why the Hulk wasn't fantastically well received on release. it has brilliant visual effects and sound throughout, some amazing actors on board for a comic book adaptation. it actually has a story. and the hulk is just brilliant, a perfect green ball of rage! this film will absolutely stand the test of time, whereas other movies with inferior and overly ambitious effects such as spider-man for example will become the super-mans of the future. just four years down the line this movie looks fresh in comparison to most of the marvel related tripe that has been released in recent years including an atrocious punisher movie, and most recently an o.a.p version of ghost rider plus a pretty crappy 1st instalment of spider-man i think overall maybe they didn't edit this movie down as ruthlessly as they should have done although the hulk is lean compared to Peter Jacksons king kong for example. and perhaps they did not market the finished product to the correct target audience. this is absolutely not a commercial kids movie, and would only really be appreciated by extremely discernible youths and young adults. for proper adults though this movie has it all.if you've been put off by the poor reviews please bear in mind that 75% of these will be from disgruntled fan boys who have not even been pacified by the presence of the wonderful Jennifer Connelly, so do not be put off.overall that says it all really, we have a complex female lead here instead of pure eye candy. a bit like this movie in general. dark, intelligent, complicated but with true underlying quality rather than your normal crash and bash Hollywood comic book trash i urge you to watch the Hulk, and hat off to Ang Lee for the best comic book to movie adaptation i have seen",Hulk
160,jace_the_film_guy,Bland,3,14 September 2021,"Who is Bruce Banner? Bruce Krenzler? This film goes to extreme measures to show the man beneath the ""Hulk"". Through two hours of endless dialogue, disjointed dreams and fragmented flashbacks, you leave the film just as confused as when it started. The script is convoluted and the relationship between Bruce and his father is never fully understood. Really, Bruce's relationship with everyone (Betty, Talbot, Ross) is never developed.Casting Eric Bana as Bruce was a mistake. Though the character is supposed to be mild-mannered and emotionally reserved, Bana's performance is just plain vanilla. Other than Jennifer Connelly, the entire cast is cartoonish and the dialogue has mediocre delivery. Though there is much more talking than smashing in this film (which I usually prefer), you never really understand any character motivations. I can forgive the bad CGI, but I cannot forgive the lack of direction and blandness of this film.

161,asage19,"Way, way better than the 2008 reboot",9,3 September 2020,"The direction is so good, the acting is best quality, the story is well told. It's a terrific blend of action movie and comic book story. It's full of heart, and depth. The Hulk's story is a good one. It deserves as reverent a telling as, for example, the Batman story, and it gets it here. I really enjoy the old-timey feeling - it's told in contemporary times, but with a retro, 1950s nuclear-age feel.
Nick Nolte is wonderful, as always. It might not have been a boon to Eric Bana, because the movie didn't do so well, but he was really quite good in the role. Everybody played it straight, no arch acting, which is due to the Ang Lee's direction. Think about it, the actors in the various key roles have played these roles before (and since), but in this movie, there's no hammy acting - these associations are there, but, as I said, played straight. It's fascinating and wonderful to see. Sam Elliot is the gruff military guy, but is human. Nick Nolte is the loony, but human. Eric Bana is full of quiet strength as Bruce Banner, and wild strength (and freedom) as Hulk but *human*. It's not a formula action hero/superhuman movie at all, it's art. Underrated art.",Hulk

This is more of a monster movie...like King Kong.Hulk. This is a very boring movie. There are many problems here. The directing is silly. Ang Lee is trying the comic book touch and it's just too cheesy too look at. The FX are so unrealistic. Hulk looks too damn silly. When Hulk transforms, why does his pants remain intact?This movie could have been a really good character study on Bruce Banner/Hulk. Unlike Batman Begins, Hulk fails to be compelling at all. Hulk just suffers from boredom. Also, when Banner says,""You won't like me when I'm angry."" is poorly delivered. Maybe a better phrase would be,""Don't screw with me buddy."" Don't get me started on Nick Nolte. He looks just as bad as the famous mug shot here. His acting was rather bad too. The only good acting here was Sam Elliot.

Less so Eric Bana who was a bit bland and boring, I thought he was great in Chopper the only other film I've seen him in. I thought the CGI was great once we eventually got to see it. If they make Hulk 2 I hope they get another Director as I think this could have been a great film if Ang Lee wasn't so serious about everything, I feel really sorry for any young kids who went to see this they must have been bored stiff.

167,senortuffy,Very good adaptation of American pop culture by a Taiwanese master.,8,3 November 2003,"Ang Lee does a very credible job of tackling a piece of Americana in his direction of this film.  For those of us who grew up in the early sixties reading Marvel comics and delighting in the exploits of Spiderman and the Fantastic Four, the Hulk is a nostalgic figure from our past.  Lee presents us with an adult take on the comic classic instead of directing the story towards today's youngsters as they did with the X-Men and Spiderman.In this film, the Hulk is shown as a real person who is undergoing a terrible transformation to his body and mind as the result of an experiment conducted by his egomaniacal father.   The father wants to expand the power of the individual, to go beyond the boundaries given to man by God, and he changes his own genetic structure and passes it on to his son.Eric Bana, an Australian actor with little experience, plays Bruce Banner, who becomes the Hulk.  Nick Nolte plays his father.  Jennifer Connelly  (""A Beautiful Mind"") plays Banner's love interest, Betty Ross, a fellow research scientist at the Berkeley lab where they both work.  Sam Elliott plays her father, a military man who was there when Banner's father conducted the original experiments years ago.I thought the two young leads, Bana and Connelly, did an excellent job in this film.  They played their parts as adults and not as what children think adults should be.  This movie isn't bogged down with sentimentality like ""Spiderman"" was - there's no big kissing scene like two teenagers out on their first date.  Banner and Ross have a matter of fact relationship and adult problems, and that adds to the seriousness of the story.The story of the Hulk explores some topics popular with 19th century philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche, who challenged traditional moralities which would constrict the creativity of the individual.  In that world view, each person's ultimate goal in life is to achieve maximum potential of one's unique self.  And as in that 19th century classic, ""Frankenstein"", the scientific experiments to alter life go wrong for the Hulk.  Bruce Banner's altered genetics are triggered by outbursts of anger, and having repressed childhood memories and problems relating to people, he has a lot of hidden anger and frustration within him.Much has been made of the unsatisfactory ending to the film, and I have to agree with those sentiments.  I was barely able to tolerate Nick Nolte throughout the film when he was a minor character - Nolte tends to overact and chew up scenery - but it really dragged the film down when he suddenly became a major player in the story.  Other than that minor point, the film was well done.  The computer graphics of the Hulk blend in perfectly with the live action (it's amazing how they've improved these techniques).  Ang Lee also uses a split screen effect to show different angles of what's going on or to show multiple actions going on at the same time that I thought were very original.I didn't expect to like this film as much as I did since I'm not a big fan of comics-to-screen films or movies that rely heavily on digital effects. But this one is very good and I recommend it.",Hulk
168,extravaluejotter,OK but not for Comic Book Geeks,6,11 December 2006,"I'm not a big fan of CGI in live-action movies, but how else are you going to show a big green guy with anger management issues smashing stuff up? The CGI blends pretty well in ""Hulk"" but you need to suspend your disbelief from a skyhook to get through some of the action sequences. It's easy to accept the Hulk's adventures when they're presented in comic book form but attempting a live-action version is fraught with danger. We're not talking about a teenager who can climb walls or a man with retractable metal claws here. Spiderman and Wolverine are just guys in costumes, so it's easier to believe that they can do amazing things because they look sort-of ordinary. The Hulk is a huge green monster with incredible strength so he HAS TO BE CGI. A green Lou Ferrigno turning a car over wouldn't cut much mustard with a modern movie audience, so Ang Lee went for a CGI Hulk whose appearance and abilities were true to his comic book origins. Although the result was impressive at his debut, I'm afraid to say that the CGI Hulk's antics began to remind me of ""Shrek"" at later points in this movie. The surfeit of CGI is one of the problems with Ang Lee's treatment of Marvel's ""Incredible Hulk"". The other is that the film spends far too much time brooding about how crap it is to be big, green and immensely strong. I don't know anything about the original comic books so I quite liked the idea of the Hulk being a result of slipshod genetic manipulation. The problem with the movie plot is that a lot of exposition was required to get the genetic concept stuff across and that tended to detract from the action. As anyone who's seen ""Matrix II"" will tell you, watching people talk to each other when you thought you were going to see lots of explosions and stunts is a tad disappointing.In a nutshell, the plot is too cerebral to keep the kids amused and too effects-laden to appeal to the so-called thinkers in the audience. Add in the fact that the script bears little relation to Hulk's comic-book origins and you've managed to alienate the die-hard-see-every-Marvel-movie-franchise comic book geeks as well. Just look at some of the more negative comments on ""Hulk"" and you'll see what I mean. I was happy enough to sit there and watch the movie on TV but it didn't make me want to rush out and buy the DVD. It's well acted and Ang Lee's direction lifts the movie above 'Average', but ""Hulk"" is just another Marvel movie franchise misfire.",Hulk
169,jake-law123,Better than I thought.,7,8 May 2014,"Based on many reviews, I was not expecting to like this. It honestly worked out in the end. It's got some issues here and there, but it all together it was pretty entertaining. They go the settle route and add drama/scientific talking scenes instead of full blown action scenes all around, it really works out. I mean the action scenes they gave us were pretty enjoyable.It does well with giving us the back story of Bruce Banner, leading up to his gamma ray exposure, introducing his ex girlfriend, his job, etc. The infamous General jackass, who refuses to listen to reason, is played well by Sam Elliot. His conversations with his daughter are handled pretty well, with his over protection and her dedication to helping Bruce hit each other hard. The scenes with Hulk, (about 3 or 4 extended scenes) are really entertaining. The visuals on him aren't the best, but it's not too noticeable. The editing is very strange, it works with several boxes of views like straight out of a Tarantino film. I don't know if that was trying to signify it as a comic book film or what, but it was kind of goofy.I didn't care too much for Nick Nolte's role in the film. The father of Bruce who returns after 30 years to see Bruce after his gamma ray exposure, trying to unleash the Hulk in him to take revenge on the military that ruined his research years ago. What I like about Hulk is the idea that only Bruce knows his powers and how to control them. Then it gives us this thing that his father knew all along and tried to control it for him, and he is the one the controls Bruce to use his powers of anger. That was a little weird in my opinion. Nick Nolte plays him okay, but his role is just kind of stupid. In the end, I don't see why this isn't that appreciated. Nothing about it is great, but nothing is really that bad either. It has solid action and solid dialogue in it, some goofy stuff also, but what comic book film doesn't? I think it does its job fine, and in the end it's worth checking out.",Hulk
170,sam_smithreview,Loved the design of the film,7,5 May 2016,"Loved the whole design of the film being looked at as a comic film. Ang Lee's filmed version of The Hulk, unfortunately, won't appeal to all those within the mainstream spectrum of movie-goers. I can guess (hearing from a few of my friends who are true-blue comic book addicts)fans of the comic will be pleased, however those who may not be fans or admirers and are simply looking for the kind of non-stop action and campy, tongue-in-cheek humor of Spiderman may be disappointed. Ang Lee has taken Stan Lee's vision of the ultimate perturbed anti-hero and created a work that can appeal to viewers with an darker art-house sensibility as well as viewers with a thirst for action-adventure blockbusters. In a sense this is similar to the approach Tim Burton used for Batman fourteen years ago, though his was given a shot of adrenaline and hilarity from Jack Nicholson as The Joker. The Hulk doesn't really have any overtly flamboyant characters like that to chew on the scenes they steal, so rather Lee looks at its core as a story of parents (notably fathers) and their children. Children who are tainted from missing and shattered childhoods from their before they can completely remember. Sam Elliot's Solider and Nick Nolte's Cast- out Father, perhaps, are the most important characters of the film after the protagonist Bruce Banner, as that they set the Jekyll and Hyde-esquire story in motion and carry/deliver much of the emotional weight that follows.Eric Bana is scientist Bruce Banner, UN-wittingly following in his father's combustible career, who wants to use gamma-radiation to help out frogs in studies, and unfortunately gets caught in an accident of catastrophic proportions. There is, he finds out, something inside of him, ever since he was a child, that gets released into the open by the radiation, and the monster within becomes an unstoppable freak of nature. The gorgeous Jennifer Connelly plays his once love interest and only true friend, Betty Ross, who gets caught in a crossroads after her father, a military man who put away Banner's father away thirty years earlier, gets involved in the pursuit.",Hulk
171,metalrage666,"Not sure what this is, but it's not The Hulk",2,10 June 2017,"I first saw this when it first hit cinemas, and I've seen it several times since, either on DVD or shown on TV and each time I view it, I'm none the wiser on where this gets off on calling itself The Hulk. On reading some other reviews, apparently I'm supposed to fall in love with this as for a superhero movie, Ang Lee has attempted (and summarily succeeded I guess), to make this more cerebral and provide an alternate take on what The Hulk is supposed to be about. Personally I think that idea failed dismally. There's nothing cerebral about this, and if they wanted to make a more structured superhero movie then I'm all for it, but when it's done at the expense of the character itself, how am I supposed to enjoy it when all the life has been sucked out of it?There are more than enough reviews outlining the movie and what happens, but nevertheless - THIS IS NOT THE HULK. It's not the Incredible Hulk, Savage Hulk or even The Sensational She-Hulk! OK it may actually have the Hulk in it, as well as one of his long time adversaries, General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, and Bruce Banner's girl, Betty Ross, but aside from the central characters, there is little else in this that resembles such an iconic figure. Putting all the same characters into an episode of The Young and The Restless, won't suddenly make that The Hulk either and so it is with this.I don't get the Nick Nolte character in this as Bruce's father, David Banner, nor do I get the bastardized origin story where the Hulk gene has been transferred to Bruce through conception, and the extra dose of Gamma radiation he ends up receiving at his lab is what finally tips the scales towards ""anger equals Hulk"". I get that this could've been yet another mindless, one dimensional and hollow superhero movie where the Hulk just smashes every ""puny human"" he comes across and is little more than a rage-a-holic, but there is no semblance in this that honours the characters' origins. The movie is way too long, has outdated CGI (even for 2003), and what in God's name was the deal with the Hulk dogs? David Banner experiments on his own dogs by exposing them to Gamma Radiation and sets them on The Hulk. Naturally The Hulk wins and the each dog explodes in a cloud of green smoke. I never got the significance of the entire scene and the effects were incredibly poor. The dogs looked fake, they weren't menacing and the scene just added unnecessary padding to an already overblown production. I would've preferred The Hulk to fight an actual villain from the comics, not this rubbish.David Banner then exposes himself to the same radiation and turns himself into a poor man's version of Absorbing Man where, as the name suggests, he can absorb whatever material he touches and then use that as a weapon. This power seems to be more of a side-effect to his experiment, rather than a deliberate result, and I had read that early drafts of this movie were supposed to have Absorbing Man as a villain, so I guess this was their way of ignoring the character completely, while still using his abilities. Next we get David Banner eating into a high power cable and in absorbing all the power, he becomes a high energy being reminiscent of a proper Hulk villain known as Zzzax, however Zzzax never had human origins and again this is another poor attempt to just ignore a good villain while still pilfering his powers and using them elsewhere. The ending is the most convoluted part of this whole misadventure where father and son are fighting each other under a lake. David Banner somehow manages to freeze the lake (maybe this is now his Hydro-man persona or something), thereby trapping the Hulk. The military blows up the lake, and they think he's dead, however he survives and he's absconded to South America to fight the rebels and give medical aid to local peasants.The 5.7 rating at the time of this review is, in my opinion, substantially generous. Regardless of how much money this made at the box office, the fact that it has been re- tooled or re-imagined twice with different actors indicates that ultimately the portrayal of the character failed to impress. Having said that, I certainly don't blame Eric Bana or his performance in this. I like him as an actor and he did his best with the material, but the 3 key points for ANY superhero movie to at least work with most audiences is - do justice to the character - don't screw up with the villains - and stay as close as you can to the source material. It's not advanced physics, it's a movie. How this managed to turn out so badly and yet have people defend it as being ""cerebral"" is an insult to over 50 years of Hulk comic history.",Hulk

Among not much will come out and follow in my opinion should be interesting. Many times these films seem absurd but the absurdity there is a part of world cinema, entertainment comics. The rage of the Hulk against men or against those who want to prevent is that no sophisticated weapon can defeat the power of nature, the strength of a powerful being. Beautiful scenes showing the attacks against the military, against tanks and f-22, remembers very Godzilla. Before you criticize stay informed on the first comics. Good comics turned into films.",Hulk
173,C22Man,"Don't understand the hate, very smart film",7,31 October 2013,"Hulk is Ang Lee's version of the Hulk which is frequently dismissed as a confused and boring movie. It is actually a much smarter and interesting film than most people give it credit for. Lee gives a deep look into the concepts of rage and isolation to create a serious drama not just a mindless action film which many people weren't expecting. The story centres on Bruce Banner who is a brilliant scientist with a troubled past. He has an accident in his Lab that exposes him to Gamma Radiation, but he survives and appears unharmed. But since the accident, whenever Banner becomes angry he transforms into a giant green monster and destroys all in his path. As Bruce's father mysteriously shows up it seems that he may get the answers to his past and what is happening to him, as he avoids the army and the girl he loves. Ang Lee must be commended for giving a detailed look at Banner, we get to see his past and how his father shaped his future. It's a great story and always fascinating. The cast is pretty great overall. Eric Bana is excellent in giving a very understated and quietly intense portrayal of Banner, he does a successful job of showing a man who is on the emotional edge. His expressions and mannerisms fit in very well. Jennifer Connelly gives a solid performance as fellow scientist Betty, she manages to be a strong lead and the connection built up between the two does feel really genuine. Sam Elliott is excellent as the aggressive Ross, he effortlessly moves between viciously perusing Banner and showing a gentler humane side in regards to Betty. Nick Nolte is great as he swings between intense whispering to over-the-top madness, but it works and he's a joy to watch. Josh Lucas is fairly decent in a basic role as the arrogant and unlikeable Talbot. As said Hulk is certainly one of the most introspective superhero movies ever made, to suggest it is a superhero movie is somewhat difficult due to how everything is portrayed. Bruce Banner is never seen as a hero per say but more as a vulnerable outcast, the action is toned down by a big stretch and the whole basis is much more philosophical than you would expect. This gives the film a richness and uniqueness that's not often found in films of this type. It drags slightly at times, but it can be forgiven for the scope is uses. Visually the film is very unusual, the film is set to look like a moving comic book as the frames switch and move around like a comic book does. At times it does look really great and is an interesting concept, but it has to be said that it is used too much and with more toning down it would be better. Much was made of the CGI, especially on Hulk himself. Again for the most part it does look pretty good mainly for the time and the mannerisms do seem genuine, but at other times its dodgy like on the Hulk Dogs. The action is spectacular when it appears as the whole desert scene is brilliantly made, the entire scope of the scene and how it shows Hulk's leaping ability and strength is great. The climax though inconsistent, is great to view. Danny Elfman creates a powerful score and its nicely different to his usual work. The change of making the Hulk grow the more angry he gets is also a great idea. Hulk is very underrated, nicely serious film and never loses it's intelligence which is something most modern superhero films suffer from.",Hulk
174,flapdoodle64,The Political Hulk,9,7 January 2011,"This is a fine and moody adaptation of the Marvel's Incredible Hulk comics, combining elements from the early Hulk stories with more recent interpretations and retcon versions of the character. In terms of visuals, acting, emotion and story, this is far more interesting than most of the comic book movies made, yet this film is exiled to relative obscurity due to underperformance at the box office.Personally, I think this film was about 2 years ahead of its time...2 years after Hulk's release the positively morose and glacially slow 'Batman Begins' was a huge hit(though 'Batman Begins' did take advantage of Time/Warner's planet-size media clout for marketing purposes).Also, 'Hulk' portrays the American military as being reactionary, treacherous, aggressive, duplicitous, and even sadistic.. all of which qualities are faithful to the original Marvel comics of the 1960's, yet are facts the gingoistic 'Mission Accomplished' media and public did not want to face in 2003.Had this movie been released after the photos of American soldiers torturing prisoners, or after the reports of US troops using phosphorus against civilians in Fallujah had emerged, the public might have accepted this film more readily. Or not, seeing as American media, 7 years later, refuse to discuss these or any other substantive issues of national morality.Regardless, this is a well-produced and well-directed film, with fine performances from Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly. Ms. Connelly in particular should be singled out for being vastly superior to Liv Tyler who replaced her for the inferior 2008 'The Incredible Hulk' film.",Hulk
175,gws-2,Better that I had thought it would be,7,13 July 2008,"Despite its relative unpopularity with IMDb viewers and the generally bad reception it received when it was released, the first ""Hulk"" has a lot going for it. The cast is uniformly wonderful and Ang Lee's direction is surehanded. I particularly enjoyed the special effects, especially the chase scene in San Francisco.I have a couple of quibbles, though. The worst is that the film 's 138 runtime is far too long. This caused it to drag in spots. Also, Lee couldn't seem to hold a consistent point of view. He shifted, sometimes jarringly, from cartoonish to super-serious darkness. It is a somewhat dark tale but, come on, it's based on a comic book. Thus, I could have done with more good natured fun and less King Lear.My reservations notwithstanding, I rather liked ""Hulk."" It was often exciting, always pleasant to look at, and had several excellent performances. 7 out of 10.",Hulk
176,allar100,"Some good, some bad",7,23 June 2003,"Despite what you have probably heard, this had some good acting, and the CGI Hulk was kind of cool.  The story was kind of neat, and I liked the ending. However, the comic book style editing was kind of distracting, and the first forty minutes used to set up the characters kind of drags, even though it is important.  I mean this is the Hulk, we want to see him do what he does best, and that is smash things.  Anyway, it is worth seeing, but don't pay full price when you can see it during the day, or just wait till rental.",Hulk
177,FeverDog,And I thought SPIDER-MAN sucked... *SPOILERS*,3,19 June 2003,"I am not the right guy to review this movie. I have no connection to it. I never read the comic book or watched the TV show. With the possible exception of THE CROW, I don't like comic book movies. I therefore won't comment on the movie so much as I'll relay what the experience of seeing it was like.The screening was sponsored by a radio station, so I was prepared to sit amongst a bunch of fanboys and those lacking proper cinema etiquette. The young boy behind me kept asking his father about the curtain in front of the screen. I guess he's grown up with ad slides before every movie, which naturally made me feel old. What a cute kid, I said to myself. This feeling would change.When the movie started (ten minutes after the advertised time of 7 pm), fans cheered the Universal logo. How nice to see a movie like this with a boisterous crowd in a packed house, I thought. Maybe I've been missing something all this time I've been going to movies at non-peak screenings.After the predictable curtain-raising action bit that I can barely recall not three hours later, a sort of bored unrest crept in the theatre, possibly led by me, after the crowd applauded again, this time for Lou Ferrigno's cameo. Talk, talk, talk went the actors, as we patiently wait for someone to adequately p**s off Bruce so we can see what we came to see. Ten minutes later, well into the movie, a group of teens who had their seats saved came in - fashionably late, I suppose. Their seats were of course in the middle of the row directly in front of me, and about six people had to rearrange themselves to let the lollygaggers through.A cell phone goes off two rows in front. Nobody boos, possibly because I'm not the only one catching a quick catnap.The first real action sequence came on it felt about a half hour in. The crowd stirred to attention. An infant cooed in the balcony. Again, the details of the scene have already evaporated from memory; it took place in a laboratory, where the Hulk wreaked havoc for some reason. Then more blah-de-blah. Then the next action bit commenced, which I do remember better, but for all the wrong reasons.It was a battle between a CGI Hulk and a pack of CGI dogs. Nothing became of it; the plot was, I far as I can tell, unaffected by the sequence. It was this scene in which I sighed, and reflected once again how computer effects have replaced imagination in modern Hollywood film. It was a depressing ten minutes, relieved only by a shot of Eric Bana's shiny round bum when the battle was over and he calmed himself down back into Bruce.But this scene illustrated my depression in another way. Eric Bana broke on the scene with a ferocious, attention-getting performance in CHOPPER. Jennifer Connolly had received an Oscar before signing on to this movie. And here they both were, trying to out-bland each other on screen. Words cannot describe how disappointed I was to see Bana looking like any other generic Hollywood grunt-for-hire. I thought he'd be a star someday. Maybe he will, but this movie is a step down on the ladder. He wasn't bad, just dull.Connolly's decision to accept this role baffles me. She receives the highest acting honor in the land, and what does she do for a follow up? Attaches herself to a role that could be played by any starlet - a part in which the talent that got her to the top is scarcely needed. After her moving work in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM - a role she *should* have won the Oscar for - she throws a decade of artistic cred out the window the moment a big paycheck beckons, cowering in a car while the computer-generated star kicks canine ass. Appalling.This scene, by the way, is what started the kid behind me asking (without whispering) inane questions. ""What's going on? Why did he do that? Where is he going?"" Shushes came from all around us, including me, but his father made no attempt to quiet him; he just answered him in the same volume of voice, ignorantly teaching his son poor movie manners. My depression continued, although I was somewhat pleased to be reminded why I prefer going to a weekday matinee a month after a movie's opening.Back to the movie. The editing style was, at first cool. Frames inside of frames, sliding here and there, in homage to its comic-book roots. It had a very pleasing retro vibe, like something you'd see in AUSTIN POWERS. But Tim Squyres, the editor, didn't know when to quit. There were some shots with three different points of view in the same frame, when just one full screen shot would have sufficed. Enough already with the visual ""creativity""!Let's jump ahead now. There's a sequence with aerial shots of helicopters flying over the desert, oddly scored by Danny Elfman with soulful female wailing set to a vaguely African tribal beat. Later on director Ang Lee goes all CROUCHING TIGER as the Hulkster transcends gravity by skipping over miles of white sands as he escapes the big, bad military with big, bad firepower (this is an American movie, after all). The brat behind me continues to voice his perplexion, in a possible effort to see what happens when *I* get angry.The next action bit was set in San Francisco Bay, as motorists act blasé at the sight of fighter jets shooting up the Golden Gate Bridge while the Hulk falls from the sky, making the expected big splash. I guess the constant threat of earthquakes has rendered sudden military warfare and a big green mass of muscle falling from the sky no big deal to the Bay Area citizenry.Another action scene, then the finale, in which the villain played by Nick Nolte gets his due. Nolte here appears like Donald Pleasance did in the later HALLOWEEN sequels - haggard, maniacal, and borderline incoherent. Still, stealing scenes from Bana and Connolly here is no great crime; Nolte's wonky performance is really the only thing the movie's got going for it.The credits roll over a godawful Scott Weiland song as the clearly disappointed crowd gives a scattered, polite but unenthusiastic applause. I normally stay to watch the credits, but this time I was out the door in a flash.The evening: 3/10",Hulk
178,FilmSnobby,"Woe woe woe, Green Giant.",2,20 March 2005,"Oh brother. Caught this on cable, having avoided it in the movieplex: my instincts were born out, to say the least. Ang Lee's *Hulk* is a humorless, pretentious mess. Lee and his writers deviate far and wide from the Hulk's comic-book origins, turning the main character into some sort of far-out, cosmic Titan, 20 feet tall, impervious to attack from bullets and heat-seeking missiles, growing ever more powerful the more he is attacked, drawing unlimited energy from his own DNA . . . God on Earth, in other words, bounding across the earth's topography like a flea on a carpet. Why? In that stupid TV series from the Seventies, bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno (granted a split-second cameo here) was at least a credible physical presence, with muscles menacing enough to convey a real sense of ""hulk-ness"". In this film, the Hulk is transposed into a computer-generated Jolly Green Giant. Not credible, not interesting, not fun. The point of the comic-book was to translate the inner rage of the teenage boys who read the comic into vicarious wish-fulfillment. The Hulk got sweet revenge with his own hands on those baddies who ticked him off or made passes at his girlfriend. The punishment was meted out PERSONALLY, Hulk-to-man. Lee's Hulk fights gigantic, rabid poodles and can toss an Army tank over into the next county. Who cares? Where's the vicarious thrill in relating to a character who is relentlessly hunted by the entire might of the American military, who must be destroyed, and who can probably be destroyed only by nuclear annihilation? Lee seems to want to make a Grand Tragedy out of this material . . . but if he wants to make Grand Tragedies, he'd be better advised to get out of the Hollywood Blockbuster business and get back to making those little prestige pictures like *The Ice Storm*.The reason why Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man* movies are more enjoyable than this one is because Raimi hasn't forgotten that movies like these are supposed to be, first and foremost, FUN. The pretentious subtexts can be enjoyed on the one hand by film snobs like myself, but a comic-book movie shouldn't remain heavy-hearted for very long. *Hulk* is deadly serious business, and as such is more unintentionally ludicrous than the great majority of this genre. (Nick Nolte's spectacularly awful performance here is a fairly typical symptom of the general disease.) 2 stars out of 10 -- the second star is earned by Sam Elliott, who is always enjoyable. Before I split, let me proffer the notion that there is a lesson to be learned from *Hulk*, a lesson to be learned particularly by Peter Jackson, who is currently making yet another remake of *King Kong*. Ang Lee basically beat Jackson to the punch: *Hulk* is more Kong than Hulk, right down to the aircraft that keeps pestering him like gnats. Lee's Kong wasn't fun. Hopefully, Jackson won't forget to put the fun in his Kong . . . though, given the maudlin solemnity in his own *Lord of the Rings* trilogy, I don't hold out much hope.",Hulk

181,Perception_de_Ambiguity,A comic book premise taken seriously,9,7 October 2008,"You might remember the live action TV-show from the late 70's. A good guy who walks the earth (a bum) to help where he can (a bum with a heart of gold), who constantly gets into trouble with one or more baddies who try to kill him and who eventually will aggravate him so that his eyes suddenly are equipped with yellow contact lenses for a second just so that the actor can be replaced with a green-painted bodybuilder who rips the flannel shirt off his body to smash his enemies and as much other stuff as possible. After he calms down his enemies either catch up with him for another round of green smashing or the episode ended right there. Yes, a remarkable concept. Gladly, Ang Lee had a little more to say with his film. It's a film that I don't like to call a superhero movie. Hulk is far from being a hero here. His two biggest enemies are himself and his father. Not much of a hero, eh? I like to understand it as an analytical and maybe even philosophical piece about anger. About the destructive power of anger, about controlling anger, using anger to your advantage,... And then of course there's this whole father/son relationship with their various problems and the father/daughter relationship with a another set of problems. The film already had me with its information packed opening titles. All of the fantasy components were presented plausibly by giving them some scientific background. Interestingly enough although the Hulk looks like he jumped right out of a comic book he blends in with the surroundings tremendously well, which is what matters to make the CGI believable. Also, it didn't make the usual mistake to also use CGI for the effect of the CGI character's actions. Most of what he touched and destroyed was real and this makes all the difference. Also, it doesn't follow the usual structure of those films. Wait, those films? What films would that be? This film is unique, I dare say. It's an art-house picture that was given to the wrong audience.The scene, the conversation between Bruce and his father before the big battle has got to be my favorite scene. It's like right out of a Greek tragedy, with a passionate delivery from Nick Nolte. The ending, the battle between father and son is powerful and not to be taken literally anymore in any way. The imagery very much suggests that.There are a multitude of conflicts without conventional villains. They all had their understandable motivations that made them do what they did. Only the Josh Lucas character was pretty vicious. But he was the representative of a government which wants all the new technology it can get to use for warfare. Funnily, in the beginning the opposite was the case. The father wanted the military to use the technology of regenerating tissue but they declined. 30 years later they went to great lengths to obtain this technology. Was Ang(er) Lee trying to make a statement with this or was it just a necessity for the story?Oh, and the editing is just brilliant. There are a couple of films which have fast editing without being style over substance. They are in fact crammed with information and the viewer needs to pay attention. Those films often are dismissed. Oliver Stone's films probably are the biggest victim of this. And this one is another great example.",Hulk
182,Venomage03,Hulk was wasted potential,2,5 June 2021,"The movie has an uninteresting story with some terrible CGI. The cut style was a very good idea, but it was way to overused. The characters were boring and uninteresting. Some scenes were done good though.",Hulk
183,gcrokus,Gray or Green,5,9 July 2004,"A story that has evolved and devolved since 1939, this newest rendition of the Green (Gray?) monster's tale is about as interesting as the earlier ones.  There are fans of comics that can differentiate the various geneses of Hulk eras, and can expostulate on the running characters or the Creature himself (there even has been a She Hulk!) in monologues as boring as those in Ang Lee's version of `The Hulk'.  This is an incredible waste of time.	Generally speaking any movie from which a video game can be made is sure to be dull or flat-out bad.  In this incarnation, a scientist is bathed with gamma rays in a botched experiment, making him prone to becoming an enraged and socially dangerous monster.  We immediately wonder (not being moved by the unfortunate accident), since he was not exactly a warm human being beforehand, why the people in his life care about him; we certainly don't.
	This to point out the completely implausible attraction of Jennifer Connelly (playing Betty Ross) to either his ugly self or his normal self; he just ain't lovable.  The only chemistry discernable between them involves a laboratory, as this is an asexual and non-sexual non-thriller.
        Jennifer Connelly is wasted  no, wait; everyone is wasted  in this movie.  It really is about The Hulk throwing things or pummeling stuff.  Sam Elliott, as a military commander intent on destroying the creature, is fun to watch.  Nick Nolte, looking like the first homeless scientist we have seen, is certainly given license to do whatever he wants, but cannot or does not convey any sense of concerned fatherhood we can understand or know.  
	The use by director Lee of panel drawings split screened into the film is interesting, and will be much copied in the future.  This was well telegraphed before the movie was released, and drew some film fans in, but does not redeem it in any way.  And it hardly moves us to relate to others that the movie is a must-see.  It really is designed for viewers ages 8-12. They can tolerate a 138 minute (should have been 90) sitting better than any.        	Fans of comic book characters projected onto the big screen must find any conversation a frustrating interlude.  Mostly we see Jennifer Connelly crying a lot after one of another of Eric Bana's (our un-Hulk human actor) frustrating misadventures.  But when conversation does occur it, as is required in comic-based movies, is so serious and therefore laughably rendered that we surely itch for him to be prodded into greenness (grayness?) via a paper cut, stubbed toe or SOMETHING.
	This is not really what the big screen is for; this movie is made with big screen TV viewers in mind.  A really comfortable chair is necessary for this one.      	Rating: Two Stars.",Hulk
184,rjsf96,A Dark Human Drama Masquerading as a Comic Book Film,7,27 September 2015,"Ang Lee's 'Hulk' has always received a bad reputation and twelve years on, its critical reception is not likely to change. Despite being superior to the 2008 reboot, it has not been given the recognition that it deserves.Bruce Banner works as a scientist with his ex-girlfriend. They are trying to achieve cell repair in animals, but to no avail. One day, Bruce is exposed to gamma radiation when a machine malfunctions; mysteriously he survives the incident. Only to discover that he changes into a ranging green monster, whenever he experiences high levels of stress.Eric Bana as Bruce Banner does a serviceable job, you buy into his character, but Bana lacks the required enthusiasm on screen. He appears as a blank slate and you just wish that he would provide more emotion when it really matters. The tormented character is the driving force in the film and sadly Bana offers little extra. Jennifer Connelly as ex-girlfriend Betty Ross is more commendable, bringing tenderness to the role and thereby selling her affection for Banner in the process. Nick Nolte as Bruce's estranged father is a scientist gone mad from his past failures. You never can tell what he is capable of doing on-screen. The times we do spend with Nolte are indeed the most compelling segments of the film.'Hulk' is still sure to split the opinions of audiences in half. What some may consider being an interesting take on the tragic hero, full of emotion and character depth, others will be overwhelmed by its admittedly self-indulgent length (at 138 minutes) and disappointed with a lack of scenes that consist of Hulk smashing up anything that he comes into contact with. Unfortunately, the CGI can create a jarring experience, from the effects looking solid to poorly animated.'Hulk' does indeed benefit though, with a smartly written screenplay by James Schamus. This is a more thoughtful and nuanced approach to a hero that many will not be expecting. It is concerned with the psychological aspects of Bruce Banner and how his relationships with his father and his ex-girlfriend shape him. If you are comfortable with the story taking its time to set up characters and plot points, darker than your average super hero flick, then you are bound to enjoy watching 'Hulk'. If not, then I would re consider whether watching this film is worth your time.'Hulk' is certainly better than its reputation would suggest. Ang Lee finds a way to make us care about a character that is essentially a giant green monster filled with rage. A sharp script helps to engage the audience, even if the running time is patience testing at best. For those that can appreciate what 'Hulk' does eloquently with its ambitious story and artistic sensibilities then they are sure to have a rewarding and satisfying experience that is among the best that Marvel has to offer in the early 2000s.",Hulk

Betty (Jennifer Connelly) is the only person who can stop his anger and must find a way to save Bruce's life as well as the well-being of others.Let me just start off by saying that this movie was horrible. It didn't start off incredibly bad. It started off somewhat interesting actually. I walked in to the theater with high expectations, so naturally I tried to enjoy the film but it was just too hard. As soon as the huge mutated dogs started to attack Jennifer Connelly and The Hulk comes and saves her, I was amazed at how much Ang Lee screwed up the blockbuster film. This movie had so much potential and failed to do anything more than confuse the audience. The effects were cheesy, the plot was stupid, and the writing was horrible. Everything about the movie was just bad, except the editing. This movie had surprisingly great editing but the rest of the movie was just so bad that it made my want to cry. The Hulk made Daredevil look like an Oscar nominee.

Eric Bana is a great actor who did a great job on this movie, and Jennifer Connelly was beautiful and lovable. Even the bad guys were well acted Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot were convincing bad-guys.Even though this sounds cheesy (real Hulk fans will know this) The movie would have benefited if there was a narration going on giving you some intraspective of what Bruce was thinking.

However.... didn't like the fact that bruce cant even get excited without turning into hulk. Isn't it supposed to be only when he gets mad?Also didn't like how bruce trying to get rid of the power instead of controlling it.

189,Asteri-Atypical,Those who appreciate the comic book will appreciate the movie,7,24 June 2003,"I'm surprised to see as many bad reviews here as I have.  But then I realized that if Hulk has one problem, it's that it doesn't fall squarely into most of the predefined categories.  While this is not a weakness in the film's quality in itself, it does result in people coming in with certain expectations, based on genre, that may not always be met.  It's not purely an ""action"" film.  It's also not a ""light-hearted"" adaptation, which is what many people think comic books are supposed to be.  What I have to say to such people is that they need to have read past issues of Hulk comic books.The movie Hulk reflects much of the feel and substance of the comic book. The Hulk comics are not frivolous; they are dark.  They are not brain-dead action.  They are full of character development and often psychological. This movie draws from the best elements of the comic book and reflects those main elements well.  If some people are disappointed, it's from their own expectations of what a movie about a large, green, visceral creature with immense power would be all about.Now on to my impressions of the merits of the movie itself:The story itself may not have been a home run but at least it was a base hit.  As I mentioned, the elements of the psychological drama of the Hulk were there.  If anything, I found myself wanting to see MORE into the characters; but there's only so much time in a feature film.  Which raises the question:  Was Lee attempting too much depth of character for the time he had?Given that the overall ""feel"" and main elements of the comic were maintained, I was surprised to see some of the particulars of the story as changed as they were.  Especially the origin of the Hulk (the accident itself), Bruce's father being alive (as opposed to a ghost from his past), Talbot and especially the concept that the Hulk continues to grow ever larger.  None of these changes seemed like IMPROVEMENTS from the comic; rather they were changes made either simply to differentiate the movie from the comic or as visual devices to make a live-action Hulk look better on the big screen.  At least the Hulk wasn't mistreated in any significant way.The casting was good.  Nolte was surprisingly effective as a burned-out has-been scientist with a crazy streak (maybe recent developments in his personal life have helped with this portrayal?).  Jennifer Connelly's natural beauty shone in this film and was enhanced by not being overly dolled up.  She once again shows her capability as an actress; it would just be nice to see her play a leading roll instead of supporting and healing tortured but brilliant scientists.The CGI was decent but not the best I've seen.  The face was probably the biggest weakness.  Still, though, anyone who has done any work with CGI must appreciate the difficulty in bringing something like the Hulk to life.Overall, I was not disappointed with the Hulk movie.  Maybe not everything was outstanding but the basic elements were there.  Which says a lot coming from a long-time fan of the comic books.  And, you have to face it; it was a smashing great time seeing a full-powered Hulk in a live action movie!",Hulk
190,lostintwinpeaks,Just plain awful.,1,22 July 2003,"Eric Bana gets a bad case of Syphilis as Ang Lee attempts to inject art into a Hollywood blockbuster, and fails miserably.This is a dire movie. The first hour is excruciatingly boring. And the constant split screens are headache-inducing. Split screens, screens merging into one, etc. look pretty good, and can be great if used sparingly and appropriately. However, in this movie they pop up every few seconds, like the opening credits of the old TV show ""Dallas"". Apparently these are here to try to distract the viewer from the complete absence of plot or anything even remotely resembling one.Eric Bana is a terrible actor, so wooden he makes Keanu Reeves look like Orson Welles. The movie also manages to waste good actors like Sam Elliot, Nick Nolte and Jennifer Connelly - not only that, but their acting is pretty awful in this movie too.It is very rare that I walk out of a movie before it is over, but this one has me racing for the door, and breathing a sigh of relief once I had escaped it.Like a bad dream you can't wake up from, ""Hulk"" is possibly the worst movie of recent times.",Hulk
191,tomrito,Interesting but where is the fun,6,21 June 2003,"I went to see the Hulk being a fan of Stan Lee and all the marvel movies so far, and I have to say I was let down.  First, the film takes too long to develop and then once it does, it plays more like a ""B"" monster movie then a comic book.  I think with this film they missed the whole point of comic books, they are for fun.  The computer generated Hulk is OK and the action, when there is action, seems to work.  But the rest of the film is just boring.  Even the actors seem to be hardly breathing.  When Jennifer Connelly is attacked by monster dogs, she sits in her car like she is waiting for a bus, no fear, no anger, she looks like she is practicing Zen. This film made Dare Devil look like a barrel of fun.  The plot is interesting, but we all know it is too far fetched to be taken that serious.

192,japamo,"Yes, Yes, it's all a rich tapestry!*",9,24 June 2003,"Ludicrous as it may seem to some, reviewing ""(The Incredible) Hulk"" (movie, comic, or otherwise) is like sampling every course in a smorgasbord. It abounds with numerous pithy and substantial themes, some classical, some Shakespearean, others mythological, from Oedipal and paternal conflict, to emotional and psychological abuse and repression, to the essence of true identity (is ""Bruce Banner"" merely the facade, and ""Hulk"" the real personality, as his own megalomaniacal father Dr. David Banner (Nick Nolte) mentions late in the film), to the intoxicating freedom of self-discovery. The movie is a skillfully constructed melange of other literary and cinematic works, from the obvious (""Frankenstein"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"") to the more arcane, bizarre, and obscure (""Altered States,"" ""The Island of Dr. Moreau,"" ""Swamp Thing!"", and yes, I do dare declare it, ""Superman: the Movie"").  Ang Lee has attempted to create an epic drama from a deceptively simplistic and superficial ""creature"" and has succeeded admirably.  All the characters reveal vulnerability, dimension, and soul.  I was transfixed watching this spectacle, and the Hulk, come to triumphant life.Anyone, I believe, caring to invest a modicum of thought and interest in the movie's unfolding should not have had any reason to be bored.  In this sumptuous buffet of a movie, the first 45 minutes of exposition were not merely nutritious ""vegetables"", but the essential meat fleshing out the enigma that is the reserved, diffident Bruce Banner and explaining his frustrating emotional constipation (Eric Bana managed to convey this stoicism and simultaneously evoke my sympathy, just as David Jansen did as Richard Kimble in ""The Fugitive"", yet another inspiration). His interaction with Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) was fascinating and seminal because although she claimed to be disillusioned with Bruce's impassivity, inevitably she could never cut herself away from him because, as the backdrop of her life demonstrated, she, too, is Bruce's alter ego and soulmate, destined to help in his healing and salvation.Despite the corncopia of themes this percolating cauldron of a movie swirls around, I feel ""Hulk"" is ultimately a movie dealing with the triumph of self-discovery, catharsis, and redemption.  Bruce was doomed to an eternal prison of self-ignorance and loneliness inflicted by his wildly iconoclastic, obsessed father.  Ironically, the gamma radiation gives him the key, because, like the potion in Swamp Thing, the rays did not transform him, but made him more of what he truly is. It is as the Hulk that Bruce salvages lost memories of his traumatic childhood. It is as the Hulk that Bruce retaliates against specific tormentors, rather than indiscrimately attack everyone in sight (as a truly mindless monster will).  It is as the Hulk that Bruce embraces the heady feeling of power and freedom and begins to examine himself at the same time. Hulk is often described as a ""tragic figure"" and ample evidence exists of that in the movie, with his anguished roars of wrath and pain, his innocent, soulful stares when he is relatively calm, and, yes, his attempts to put his power to good use (e.g., saving Betty from the freakish Hulk dogs and (in my opinion) trying to save the jet from crashing into the Golden Gate Bridge. I think Ang Lee was trying to chronicle the birth of a new ""Superman"", crude, terrifying, and unrelenting at first, but striving to become a true, caring, FORGIVING, superhero (as he demonstrates when he shakes the soldiers out of the tank turret before destroying it and during his cathartic, climactic battle with his berserk, ""Absorbing Man"" father).  Ultimately, Ang Lee transcends the tragedy of the Hulk's origin to suggest that, with luck, Bruce/Hulk will overcome their horrific legacy and the uncomprehending hostility of mankind (a la X-men) to become a fully contributory and valuable member (not just a scientific genius) of the world.As you can see, I could turn the ""Hulk"" into a Ph.d dissertation.  I am sure some graduate student already has.  Yet, lest you think I am some verbose intellectual snob, let me assure you I also enjoyed the Hulk's visceral as well as cerebral pleasure.  The entire desert/San Francisco battle sequence was taut, exciting, and exhilarating.  The CGI behemoth, I felt, was utterly convincing and compelling, both in close-up and during his prodigious, soaring leaps.  Hulk's phenomenal powers themselves are not a curse, as Roger Ebert mentioned in his review, but a blessing in an ""inhuman disguise"".  Hulk revels in his power; during one of his stratospheric leaps, he actually reminded me of Superman in the 1978 movie just soaring through the air for the sheer joy of it.  Also, Hulk runs better than the adolescent Superman in the 1978 film.In conclusion, I believe Ang Lee successfully delivered both an intellectual and emotionally stimulating and evocative movie and created a respectful homage to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's classically archetypal character.  To those reviewers who were bored with Hulk, let me respond with a paraphrase of a famous movie quote: ""'Hulk"" was a banquet, and most poor film watchers were starving to death.""Needless to say, ""Hulk"" is a definite future DVD purchase I will treasure.*  The Summary line comes from Marge's psychiarist who was treating her flying phobia which partly originated from the trauma of seeing her father as a stewardess.  Yes, parents (especially fathers) are the Freudian scapegoats of psychological ruin.",Hulk
193,mcsheehey,It's Not That Bad!,5,7 June 2007,"""Hulk"" was widely anticipated as a release, and it disappointed most people. Why? The characters are very uneven, the plot is confusing, the effects are every strange, and the storyline is so far-fetched that it's ridiculous. Still, it's not as bad a film as everyone says.I won't bother summarizing the film. If you don't know the story by now, you probably never will. Eric Bana plays the Hulk/Bruce Banner, and I found that he does a fine job. My only problem is that he seems kind of blank and dull at times, and has no real distinctive personality. His evil father (nick Nolte) sold me right away however, with his creepiness and evil look. Talk about a frightening villain! The best performance of the film comes from the underrated Jen Connelly. She is fantastic as Betty, bringing some much-needed emotion into the story. They needed an Oscar-winner, and she gave them one. The plot is the real problem. Though we get some very cool action scenes and such, some moments are ridiculously bizarre, and i found myself confused at times. For that reason, I didn't love the film, but I liked it just fine for what it's worth. I'd recommend it to younger teens more than anyone else.",Hulk
194,Sfpsycho415,"Boring, long Marvel movie---3/10",3,20 June 2003,"I just came back from watching this crap and i have mostly negative things to say, but first i want to say that Ang Lee is a great director but a lot of the direction in this movie gave me a headache. Too many shots of DNA and molecules spliced into where they don't belong. The only good things about this movie is Nick Nolte and Jennifer Connelly, the former for some great acting and funny moments, and the latter for being something nice to look at during an otherwise horribly boring flick. The action scenes were pretty decent, but not frequent enough. The story sucked. Maybe because i am not a Hulk fan. I did enjoy watching him destroy things but other than this the movie falls flat. Only if your a die-hard Hulk fan should you see this. Otherwise, i would steer clear. 3/10",Hulk
195,bbbl67,I really don't see what people are complaining about,9,1 July 2003,"I've read some of the negative comments about this movie, and honestly, I don't see what is wrong with this movie, I loved it. I think the people who didn't like the movie need to go back and see it another time, and this time pay attention to the slower parts at the beginning. Maybe then, they'll like it. I'll admit that the opening part of the movie was much slower than the closing part. It also required some concentration on the part of the viewer to fully understand it, so maybe if someone wants to criticize Ang Lee's narration style about the scientific basis for what was happening, then I'll agree. Perhaps showing David Banner as he was doing his original experiments and have him explain the results instead of getting them off his lab notes would've been a better way to go. When the action gets going, it's really great. The CGI special effects are unexpectedly better in close up shots than in the far away shots. This is the opposite of what usually happens where CGI looks better in distant shots. For example the Hulk looked very natural when it was fighting or resting in the close ups, however it looked very unnatural when doing long jumps and landings, etc. Also look for the cute way that Ang Lee resolved the David vs. Bruce Banner naming controversy. In the comics, they sometimes called him David Banner or Bruce Banner. Ang Lee decided to give the name David to the father, while Bruce is the name of the son. In the Hulk tv series, they resolved it by making the character Dr. David Bruce Banner (i.e. first name and second name). I liked it a lot better than Spiderman or the X-Men. But I haven't seen the X Men 2 yet, so I'll reserve judgement.",Hulk
196,robinski34,"Hulk Smash (well, not exactly)",7,27 September 2013,"Much more effective rendition of big green than 'The Hulk', the first act ably captures the feeling of perpetual roaming that is such an important element of the character, emphasising Bruce Banner's humanity through his human contacts. Meaning no disrespect to Eric Bana, but Edward Norton is more believable as the cerebral Banner, and Liv Tyler with her glasses on is sufficiently bookish for Betty Ross. A great cameo by Tim Blake Nelson (with a hint of Simpsons' nutty professor) is just manic enough without being overly comedic. Unfortunately for a Marvel flick I feel that it was let down by the action sequences, but I suppose it could have been worse, I could have been viewing in 3D, good enough in the end, but roll on The Avengers.",Hulk
197,miken-3,Missed the mark!,5,24 January 2005,"What could have been a great movie, slogs through the first hour at an excruciatingly slow pace. Very weird directing where the screen splits into four different scenes, does more harm than good. Bruce Banner, a child of parents that lived in a military base that tested nuclear devices like Los Alamos, grows up to be a scientist too. When he is exposed to a dose of gamma radiation, the genetically mutated cells in his body go crazy and he is transformed into the Hulk using Shrek-like animation techniques.The Hulk in this film looks and moves just like the Hulk in the comic book as opposed to the Lou Ferrigno (he makes a cameo as a guard at the beginning of the film) Hulk of the 80's. He battles gamma-mutated dogs, the military and his gamma-mutated father (played in an incredibly boring fashion by Nick Nolte).Some of the special effects of the film are great while others look real cheap (the Hulk has a battle in the desert with airplanes that look like they came off a carnival ride instead of like real fighter jets).Sam Elliott is great as General Thunderbolt Ross. The rest of the actors, especially the actor who plays Banner, need to go to acting school to learn how to put some emotion in their roles.Don't spend your money on this one. Wait to watch it on free TV!",Hulk
198,mwendel,Not What You Necessarily Expect (Spoilers),8,6 July 2003,"Well the first thing to say, is if you are a big fan of CGI animation, this is a movie for you to check out.  I would say this is probably the most ambitious use of CGI and human interaction that I can think of to date. Yoda was cool, but the Hulk, to me looks and feels more real, whereas I felt Yoda had the ""glow"" of the force around him.This is a film that I didn't take to immediately.  After watching it, I was kind of like: that's it?  But the more that I sat back and thought about what Ang Lee created; I said that was way cool.  He truly portrayed the Hulk as exactly, I think what his creators envisioned; an somewhat mindless, anger driven creature.  The similarities between a cornered animal and the hulk are very similar.  The more you back him in the more hostile he is going to get, and the proof is in the pudding.The Hulk, in classic fashion, has just bounded away into the desert (which is something I saw in the comics, but never considered the actual magnitude of until it was actually rendered in 3D in the movies - amazing power!) and is beginning to just calm down and in comes the army.  The shoot at him and hit him.  He just stands there looking, like; Why me? What did I do?  Leave me alone!It is in that moment that the true aura and charm of the Hulk comes through for what he truly is, a man/monster tormented because of his potential for doing harm versus what he actually does.  If people left the Hulk alone he wouldn't hurt a file, but people keep provoking him over and over never allowing him to rest, just enraging him even more.Ang Lee's Hulk is a movie that I hope won't be ruined by a sequel.  I think by itself, over time (especially after it hits DVD and Cable), will truly make a statement that comic book movies don't just have to be these action packed rock 'em and sock 'em adrenaline rushes, but an artistic expression as colorful as the original comics.",Hulk
199,Soysoy,Interesting failure,5,8 December 2003,"This movie is definitely a failure. It lacks in so many ways! But it's indeed a very interesting failure.The acting direction is almost non-existent, the actors are apparently reading their lines while shooting thus we have flat 2-dimensional characters, except for Nick Nolte's one (good work). Sam Elliot is OK but he's quite self-mimicking. Anyway casting Eric Bana as the Hulk was quite a poor decision.I bet Ang Lee was NOT directing the actors at an early stage. I know he is a very good acting director (""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman"" and ""The Ice storm"" are great proofs). I'm even suspecting Lee was called at the last minute, to save this movie from total disaster, when the producers saw the appalling shooting material they would have to make a movie with.The storyline... well it's a comix adaptation, OK, but what a dull screenplay these guys came up with! It's even confusing at times, and seems to have no unity. Some holes, too.A failure, for sure. But a very interesting one. Because Ang Lee introduced (probably in an attempt to enhance the poor shooting work) all sorts of cool, cinematic, jubilating stuff at the post-prod stage. We have creative/dynamic editing, split screens, dreams presented as reality... all of this is clever, intelligent, engaging moviemaking that brilliantly  reflects the comix universe's ""feel"". And I bet Lee was responsible for the outdoors scenes with the Hulk, that are outstanding in terms of space and movement. The CGI imagery during the father/son fight is really impressive too, and some shots look like what some scenes in X-2 should have been.And (at last!), a really GOOD musical score for a super-hero blockbuster. Elfman gives us one of his finest ""mainstream movies"" jobs. Not as outstanding than his works for more alternative/arty movies of course, but this is definietly the best score of all the recent mainstream blockbusters.So we have this half-baked flick. Some quite outstanding, jubilating cinematic features over a cheap-TV-series-like screenplay and shooting. Strange object. To my ""don't know what to do with it"" pile. I can't even rate this one.Imagine this editing/post-prod style with a good story, good acting and a good director in charge right from the start. Woaw. I'd LOVE that.",Hulk
200,SSJAniFan,WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!,1,4 July 2003,"I never liked the Hulk in my entire life, and only went to see this dog-fodder because there wasn't anything else to see.  It's a really bad movie, with horrible direction, including horrible comic-book paneled scenes.  The guys who made this may think that making the film seem like a comic is cool, but it's rather distracting.  I even got motion sickness from it.  Also, they constantly go into dream sequences and flashbacks, so you'll never know what's going on.BOTTOM LINE:  Hulk smash.  Hulk destroy.  Hulk star in very bad movie. Avoid this.  Even the horrible X-men 2 is preferable to this one.",Hulk
201,ryanwinning1,Blown away by the quality of The Hulk!,9,16 April 2019,"I am shocked that at the time I'm leaving this review this movie is sitting at an average score of 5.7 out of 10. I rate it 9/10! The quality of acting really stands out to me as different than any of the newer Marvel movies. Most Marvel movies have a constant jokey vibe going on between serious scenes so it's a pattern of like action, joke, drama, joke, action, joke, drama etc etc. This movie maintains a steady dramatic pace to it that I actually appreciated a lot more than I thought I would. I remember friends saying that the CGI was awful and choppy in this movie and is not even bearable to look at in modern times, but I beg to differ. Not only do I think the CGI looks great but the fight sequences are really creative and imaginative. The one scene I didn't like was when Betty goes to visit Nick Nolte(Bruce Banner's father) to ask him a few questions and Nick Nolte acts extremely creepy and opens up several cans of worms within a few minutes of Betty coming in the door and Betty(Jennifer Connoly) totally doesn't act the way a normal person would. Nick Nolte spills the beans that he is Bruce's father when Betty was under the impression that he was just the janitor of their lab, and she's not shocked at all by this. He then proceeds to tells her that Bruce has this incredible unique quality that nobody knows, but is extremely dangerous and powerful, and then quickly shoe's Jennifer Connoly's character out the door and Connolly gives absolutely no resistance whatsoever despite this absolute bomb that Nick Nolte has just dropped on her. Aside from that scene the acting is truly captivating. I think it's probably the deepest dramatic acting movie of all the Marvel movies I can think of to date! So sorry to see that the movie was an epic flop at the box office because I think it deserved to be a lot more successful!",Hulk
202,TerminalMadness,Incredible...,10,30 June 2003,This is the best movie released by Marvel so far. The action and drama incredible but you want to see something incredible you watch the phenomonal directing by Ang Lee. he makes such an attempt to make this movie into a masterpiece and he almost succeeds with electric performances from a stellar cast and Eric Bana is perfect as Banner. I loved it.,Hulk
203,LinkGoku,underrated marvel movie,10,19 June 2009,"when hulk came out i waited to rent it on DVD because i heard so many negative remarks about it, then when it was released onto DVD i rented it and was amazed that so many people didn't like it, this has been and always will be a favorite of mine, Sam Elliot is so good in this movie, then there's Eric Bana who did good though i think Edward Norton did better, and both Liv Tyler and Jannifer Connoly did great, i don't know which movie i like better between Hulk and The Incredible Hulk, there both great achievements in my book, i heard so many remarks that Hulk had to many stories to follow, but i thought though there were many stories in this film it was still easy to follow, and not only was the acting great but the effects were top-notch, at the time that i saw it it was my favorite marvel movie, though i have recently stumbled upon The Punisher which is amazing, but this will always be in my collection.",Hulk
204,WrathChld,From the Beast within,7,4 November 2003,"In the past few years, ""Comic Book"" movies have become the craze.  People who are extremely into comics and ones, who are not, could all come together and enjoy these movies on different levels.  In allot of ways, I think the ""X-men"" movies have done the best at this, only because there is more ""mutants"" to observe.  Of course the classic was ""Spider man"" and then came rolling in like a runaway train, the ""Hulk"".  I was a big Hulk fan growing up, from the comic books, cartoons, and the TV series with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno.  I just loved the force and power that was the Hulk.  I loved how this man (that was a threat to no one) could transform into this beast that could destroy all it encountered.  It was great.  So I was excited when I heard the Hulk was coming out.  It didn't get the best reviews and allot of people couldn't get over the Hulk being computer generated.  I have to admit, I wasn't crazy about it myself.  All I heard was you couldn't capture all that is the Hulk, with a man playing him.  Why not?  Isn't that what SFX are for?  Don't tell me it couldn't have been done with an actor and with camera angles and SFX.  I just don't like how they dismissed an actor, but they did and I tried to get past that.  I watched it with as open of a mind as I could and I enjoyed the movie.  They did add history and Hulk facts in this version that were different from the comics, but they were well done and interesting.  I liked the storyline.  I liked the action and this movie did do a good job of making you're heartbeat with adrenaline in those intense scenes.I would have to give Hulk a 7.5 out of 10.  It was a good movie with allot of interesting stuff.  I loved the comic book style display of scenes throughout the movie.  That just gave it a great feel.  The computer generated Hulk was cool, but I still believe a real person would have been better.  I hope the movie did enough good, to allow a sequel.  If you are a Hulk fan, then check this movie out.  It might not be the greatest, but it does the job.  I just hope we get to see the Hulk storyline develop.",Hulk
205,wastebot,Best of the big summer releases of early 2003,9,23 June 2003,"If I were see Hulk, X2, or Matrix Reloaded again, Hulk would be my pick.While it may not be up to the standard the first X-men or Spiderman set, it still is far better than many of the comic-book wanna-bes like Daredevil.
After all the talk of the long setup, it's sad to find that the setup is the weakest part and not nearly as long.  There could easily be another 5 minutes, and it would help.  The pace of the movie is more than fast enough despite the length.  Anyway, there is at least one little surprise in the beginning that adds a much needed laugh, though the 5 year olds will miss it.As for the visual FX, wow.  As close to human/creature realism as anything before it, with the possible exception of the Two Towers.  More realistic in the naturalness of the movements and integration with the real world (buildings, trees, people, water, etc.).  Eight Legged Freaks did a good job of it last year with spiders, but you can get away with a lot more with non-human creatures.   That and there were still moments of dimensional displacement (in the old huge creature movies, the points where it's obvious the creature and the other objects, be they buildings, people, etc., were not actually together).  In Hulk, nothing like that jumped out at me.  The Hulk always seemed as if it were actually with the surroundings and people.Soundtrack fit in well, nothing forced.  Nothing distinctly original or groundbreaking, but enjoyable anyway.  The sound FX has a realism in it too. Not too big or loud as is often becoming the case in other movies.  The surround sound, like every other big movie, is still lacking.  That said, there isn't any sound displacement to make it seem faked.As for the acting, it fit with the overall comic-book, over-stated sort of feel where everything, including personalities, are exagerrated, like 50s-style characters.",Hulk
206,Pingo-2,Ang Lee is boring as usual.,6,8 July 2003,"HULK is a good movie. Though, it is NOT because of Ang Lee.The film starts out with a boring 40 minutes of characterizations, which could have been cut down to about half that time (and probably still be boring). This stuff is needed to understand the story and to get interesting characters, one might say, but that is totally wrong. The characters are not interesting, except for Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) who is at least a little bit interesting.However, when Bruce Banner becomes HULK the first time, the film lifts a bit, but that is only because the computer animations are so similar to the comic itself. HULK moves, feels, looks and acts like HULK should. This is very good.However, all live-action is boring as hell, and the story line could have been better. Ang Lee's directions are sleepy and tiresome. If it wasn't for the CGI this film would've been a total flop. And I usually hate CGI.I gave it 6 out of 10. HULK is cool and demolish things in fun ways. It is nice to see an adaption of the green creature that follows the book as much as it do when it comes to the transformations, but other than that, this movie is dull. This will not be a film we will remember next year.",Hulk
207,walken_on_sunshine,The Hulk,6,11 January 2007,"The Hulk focuses far too much on the storyline of how Bruce Banner became the hulk but people don't want to see Bruce Banner for 3/4 of the movie we want HULK and lot's of him.Unfortunately we overall get like just over 30 minutes of Hulk and maybe 45 minutes of overall action not what you want in a film about a huge angry monster trashing stuff and wasting people.Instead we receive more of a drama and without the few and far between action sequences this would've been a really good drama.This movie really makes you connect with the characters and they really give each of them a huge back story and a lot of depth but honestly this is the wrong movie for that.Comic geeks will more than likely hate this movie because it doesn't have hulk smashing the crap out of everything for an hour and a half instead they get an emotionally driven forbidden love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross.The camera angles are really cool in this film i love how they show many of the scenes from three different angles and perspectives it was a very original and unique aspect of the film.The Hulk looked alright I suppose but he was first off way too big and way too fictional looking the whole time you're think that's so graphics.People weren't ready for a love story filled with passion,angst,and unjust situations that force it's audience to feel what the characters feel people just wanted The Hulk to have just enough story and character development to help us understand and then scene after scene of the incredible hulk causing destruction and mayhem and i guess i sort of was too.I respect and enjoyed this completely different and unique take on The Hulk and what he is all about as a person and how his actions effect both who he loves and who he hates.Overall fantastic acting,great characters, and a different interpretation unfortunately with very little action and too much talk.Not enough Hulk too much Bruce Banner 7 out of 10.",Hulk

Hulk great!!,10,28 May 2009,"This film adaption of one of Marvel comics greatest and beloved characters is nothing short of genius, this is how all comic book adaptions should be filmed. With a respect,amazing visuals, a good well balanced script and exceptional acting. This is movie making at ti's finest.2003's Ang Lee directed Hulk is very cerebral and slow paced, but he pace makes it a hundred times easier to follow and understand, this Hulk version follows an almost similar story line to the comics and the 1970's T.V. series it tells a dark and very emotional story of the Hulk's beginning and it paint's a portrait of the Hulk the likes we've never seen before. I've watch this film backwards and forward and I can't seem to place it why people don't like this film, it's extremely enjoyable and very well made, so why? Because it's too slow? Or maybe it's because the Hulk doesn't destroy everything every five seconds.If you can look passed the slow pace and the lack of action then you've got yourself a brilliant, well thought out and made film. Hulk isn't a landmark among Marvel comic films but it definitely is pretty close. All in all Hulk is worth the rental or even to buy this movie delivers what it sets out to a good out of this world adventure. Hulk delivers.",Hulk
209,MsMovie,The CGI is NOT the problem with this movie...,4,12 July 2003,"... the problem is the director!Did Ang Lee have to make such an angst ridden movie? I mean come on, I saw Daredevil, it was quite a dark movie at times, even Batman (the orginal one that is!) was a little dark, but this was like watching an essay version of The Hulk.I mean, was it 40 minutes before the Hulk himself appeared? I knew the CGI was not going to be that realistic, I had heard reviews already from the USA, but it wasn't that bad. I have to say it was like watching a real human being turn into a cartoon, but that really didn't bother me overly.What really irritated me was how slow the movie was, how many deep and meaningful pauses and drawn out, pained phrases and wounded facial expressions there were.Eric Bana is a good actor, he could have played this part brilliantly under a different director, in fact, I think the movie would have been much better without Ang Lee, he just isn't a comic-book-hero movie director, it's just not him.All in all, I would say to anyone who is planning on dishing out some dollars to see this movie:go on cheap movie night, or to an early show. - don't go if you're tired, unless you actually want to sleep (there was a guy who woke with a start when a particularly violent and noisy part was on screen and his kids were not thrilled that everyone noticed). - if you are not totally into comic book stories or the Hulk, wait for it on video or DVD, or even TV!I saw 3 adults walk out during the performance, which is rare, but I could understand it because they had young children with them who were obviously not enjoying the movie.Let me finish with one important fact: I have been looking forward to this movie ever since I heard about it being made, and that's quite a long time, and I don't think I have ever been so disappointed. No wonder the box office so far has not been good, I think it'll be a stretch for this movie to make it's money back at all, except when it goes to rental at home.Oh Mr Lee, you made me very angry with this movie, and you really wouldn't like ME when I'm angry!",Hulk
210,Signet,Not Half Bad,8,16 May 2004,"Guided by the reviews when the film was released, I deliberately and carefully avoided seeing it in a theater. Now, I'm sorry.  The movie is not nearly so bad as the general public was led to believe and is, in fact, quite effective and even, in parts, moving.  Although these are not qualities one either expects (or even wants in a picture with comic book origins), they are also scarcely to be considered debilitating to the overall effectiveness of the project.Much of the power of the film comes from the performances of two old pros, Nick Nolte (playing himself, before rehab) and Sam Elliott (playing himself).  These old rhinos snort up all the air in every frame in which they appear. No one else can touch them, particularly not Eric Bana, whose profound rages come across as temper tantrums until the special effects kick in and he is wholly computer generated.  The ""monster"" gives a particularly fine performance and his programmers are to be commended.It is, on the whole, a very satisfying movie.  And a badly underrated one.",Hulk
211,jake-179,"AWFUL, BORING, AND WAY TOO LONG",1,23 June 2003,"This movie SUCKED!  I hated it.  Don't waste your time!  It was awful!Now let me support my feelings against this movie!  The characters were not properly motivated.  It seems that is the main problem with a lot of movies these days.  Screen writers are having a difficult time keeping the characters motivated.  For example, the Hulk's dad, Mr. Banner, sends his mutant dogs to attack Hulk's girlfriend FOR NO REASON AT ALL!  People were in the theatre going, ""Why is he trying to kill her?""  That part of the movie made no sense.  Then that blond guy from the weapons lab barges in to Banner's house while he is under ARMED guard, and physically attacks him for NO REASON.  Meanwhile, the armed guards stand around uselessly and do nothing.  Another problem, they kept capturing the Hulk and putting him in lock down.  And each time, Sam Elliot would do a horrible job over acting and scream, ""NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO INTERACT WITH BANNER!  HE IS TO REMAIN CONFINED UNTIL THE END OF HIS NATURAL LIFE!""  Then, IMMEDIATELY, someone would be allowed to interact with Banner and make him mad, then he would turn in to the Hulk.  Off the top of my head, this happened no less than THREE TIMES in the course of the movie.  Of course, that part of the movie came at GREAT LENGTH!   It took FOREVER for the Hulk to finally show up.  They shouldn't have called this movie ""THE HULK,"" they should have called it, ""THE LONG BORING WAIT FOR THE HULK TO APPEAR.""  People in the theatre around me were LITTERALLY shouting at the screen, ""Where is the Hulk?""  One man told his daughter, ""Don't fall asleep baby, the Hulk is coming.""  It was PATHETIC!  I hated this movie! 
As if all this was not insult enough, Nick Nolte's weird character of Banner Senior was really stupid.  At the end, he gains the power to become ""ANYTHING MAN.""  This means, anything he touches, he can become.  So, at the end, they have Banner chained up in front of a big microwave, and they say, ""No one go near him.  If he so much as moves, we will kill him!""  Then, they IMMEDIATELY let Nick Nolte go over and start provoking him!  Nick Nolte is CHAINED UP, and the whole scene was a like a bad college play.  Then Nick bites in to an electrical cable and becomes Electricity Man.  Then he fights the Hulk and becomes Water Man.  Yes, the movie is actually as stupid as I am making it sound.  This movie sucked SUPER BAD.  I hated it!  I am getting angry just thinking about it, and you wont like it when I am angry!  I dont like it when movies SUCK!  JAKE SMASH!  HULK TRASH!Avoid this stupid, boring movie at all costs.  I rate it a ZERO on a scale of 1 to 10.  The only good thing is being able to look at the beautiful Jennifer Connelly.  She is SUPER HOT!  The movie should have been about her.  All the shots should have been of her, doing anything.  That would have been INFINITELY more entertaining than this green pile of waste!",Hulk

213,TheBabblingFool,"Thank you, Ang Lee, thank you!",10,2 July 2003,"I'll openly admit that I was never a Hulk fan. It didn't seem the type of idea that could last through a series of comic books. I never watched the TV show because it always looked like a silly, bastardized version of the comic. But when the idea of a Hulk movie came out I was all for it.
I mean on the surface The Hulk seems like a fun movie idea like a minature Godzilla with a Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde complex, who the world treats like a modern-day Frankenstein. I didn't think about how Hulk is rage unleashed, that Bruce Banner has to battle in his brain to control the Hulk. Basically I didn't think about the psychology behind this superhero. But Ang Lee did, he thought about it and treated it with full seriousness. Instead of making an easy-breezy throw away film with a lot of smashing and bashing, that would seem like a bad monster film and would be forgotten within 20 minutes. Ang made a serious drama that focuses on characters effected by the Hulk events, with a few seriously delicious smashing and bashing sequences.
It's not like comic book films haven't been getting more serious, ""X-men"" opened up in the Holocaust, ""Daredevil"" showed the hero come home and pop painkillers, not to mention any Batman related TV show (during the 90's) always deals with the tragedy of Bruce Wayne's life. And this isn't the first film dealing with superheros with an extremely serious tone to it, I believe that title goes to M, Night Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable"". This too is a film that focuses on the relationships and troubles of the characters, and that is what makes the film more intriguing.The acting is supurb, Jennifer Conelly is top-notch, but you don't expect any less of her. Nick Nolte is excellent playing the crazy David Banner, almost to the point of being over-the-top. Eric Bana is the real hero here, he is a perfect Bruce, playing a mild-mannered scientist, who has a lot of repressed anger due to a childhood trauma.Bruce Banner can be looked at as the person we are all forced to be in society, repressed. Our society wouldn't function if we all were allowed to unleash our anger in the form of The Hulk. Which brings me to Hulk, the finest CG performance I have ever seen. Ang Lee did the motion capturing himself, giving Hulk a really realistic performance. He did things, little things, that only angry people do. He had a harder performance to pull off because he doesn't say a word but his movements and reactions give off such an uncanny human quality and personality to them. As far as when Hulk is violent, it's BRUTAL, it's bone-cracking, gut pounding brutality, which is so good it's beautiful. Watching it is anger management. I was cheering when Hulk was smashing tanks, it was pure joy to watch.The other thing I must praise is the editing, which not only gives the film a comic book feel, but a smooth transitioning flow, that keeps the eye moving and the brain active to soak up everything in this movie.All in all I LOVED Hulk, I have always wanted to see comic book material taken seriously, and Ang Lee pulls it off with flair, putting it in my favorite comic book movies list. I recommend you go see it, I can't say that you'll completely like it, but I can tell you that you will have an opinion about it.",Hulk
214,whatdoes1know,THE INCREDIBLE WHO FRAMED BRUCE BANNER STORY with guest appearances by the Hulk,5,24 June 2003,"Bruce Bana is a mean-looking dude. When he says he likes looking mean, he's scarier than all of the romping and stomping the Hulk does combined. it's because Ang Lee's Hulk has those lovey-dovey hubby-dubby cute and adorably loveably gleaming disney eyes. They are so shiny and sparkly that how could anyone resist speaking in baby language while watching that cute innocent giant green teddy bear smashing its first military base to smithereens?It's the same problem GODZILLA 2000 had. Enormous shiny anthropomorphic pupils in the eyes. The giant rubber God. could flatten Tokyo for good, and he would still look cute doing it. Hence the white-eyed pitiless Godzilla in the third installment. The Hulk could have been a greater visual menace had he had smaller pupils and the wrath of an angry Bana. Instead, the Hulk mopes around a lot, and looks like he needs to be locked up in a small room alone with Eric Bana.",Hulk
215,JAKastner,"The Moose Hole - ""Hulk Mad! Hulk Smash!!"" Wish I could!",3,20 June 2003,"Almost every boy can remember reading a Marvel comic book at some point in their childhood reading in astonishment about the amazing adventures of world's most favorite superheroes. One always wishes that they could see those feats in real life. Well now, in a way, we can. A recent trend of adapting comic book heroes to the big screen has taken Hollywood by storm. Starting with the success of films like Blade and X-Men, this trend expanded rapidly with the huge success of Columbia's Spider-Man, which grossed $400 million domestically and broke most box office records. Now every studio wanted to get into the act as each new superhero film seemed to out do the last one. Even films based on lesser known characters, like Daredevil, were met with success. The general opinion of the American public seemed to be that they were willing to rush out to the theaters if the studios were willing to pump out more of these amazing comic book adaptations that brought boyhood dreams to life. The most recent example of this theory is the $210 million domestic gross of X2: X-Men United and the critical acceptance of the film as well. But sooner or later, one has to admit, the dream can only go so far. Whether we liked it or not, the American public will receive a superhero film that does not live up to their expectations. The only question is what film will that be? Universal hopes that it is not their adaptation of the big green behemoth, The Hulk. With a $135 million budget and several rewrites on the troubled, Ang Lee hopes that his version of The Hulk will continue the superhero trend but will all that hard work end in failure for the promising director?The story goes that Bruce Banner is just a normal man like everyone else. He was adopted as a young child and has no remembrance of his past life as a young child. But nothing really seemed to set him out from the crowd outside of the fact that he was very quiet and always bottled up his emotions preventing him from feeling any real connection to anybody. That may be the reason why he and fellow scientist Betty Ross recently ended their relationship together. But the end of this relationship is just the beginning of the troubles for Bruce Banner. The father he never knew comes back after Bruce has a freak accident in a lab experiment involving radiation. He reveals to Bruce that he is unique and that the world will never accept him for what he is. Bruce still fails to understand what he is but that doesn't last for too long. Every time Bruce feels emotional anger within, he looses control and becomes The Incredible Hulk. Bruce must learn to control his emotions before he is eliminated by the army. The story for The Hulk is mediocre at best but what can one do when there isn't much story around The Hulk to begin with. Sure there is the story of his origin but outside of that it is just basically, `Hulk get mad! Hulk smash!' Ang Lee tries his best but those attempts end in failure. There is no consistency with the story as it is either too slow or too fast in some parts of the film.The cast of The Hulk tries its best to make due with what is given to them and some cast members work better then others. New comer Eric Bana, who stars in WB's summer 2004 tent pole, Troy, is actually quite good as the human form of Bruce Banner. His look, which is quite similar to Orlando Bloom, seems just right and the way he tries to control his emotions makes the character all the more sympathetic. Bana is probably the best member of the entire cast as he plays his character to perfection. Jennifer Connelly, fresh from her Academy Award winning role in A Beautiful Mind, is moderate as Bruce's love interest, Betty Ross. She tries her best to bring some emotion out of the character but there really anything that strikes a cord with the audience. The problem is that she is crying in every other scene. There is suppose to be connection between her character and Bana's but there just isn't one that we can clearly see but that is not all her problem. Rather it is the problem of the story. Nick Nolte is great as Bruce's father, David Banner. The only problem with his character is that he seems to just disappear for moments of the film and then reappear. There is no clear distinction on what the purpose of his character is. Is he really just a misunderstood loving father or a power hungry psychopath? No clear answer is given. Josh Luca's character, Glenn Talbot, seems just pointlessly placed in the film. What does his character have against Bruce that makes him attempt to kill him in his home? A highlight within the beginning of the film was the cameo of Stan Lee, the creator of The Hulk and Spider-Man, as a security guard. It is nice to see him appear in each of the films based on his famous comic characters.Overall, The Hulk tries so hard to prove itself a success that it just ends in dismal failure. There are so many problems with this film that they can't all be named at one time. The comic book styling of the film with split screens and cuts and wipes was just ridiculous. One does not go to a film adaptation of a comic book character expecting a comic style to it. If one wanted something like that then you could just pick up a comic book and read. A film adaptation is expected to bring a comic book to life rather then just incorporate the comic into film. The story is also a big problem. Either the actions are going too slowly or too fast. There is no sense consistency at all for the film. Many questions are also left unanswered. Why did Bruce's father not kill Bruce? He killed his wife but only accidentally. He had the opportunity, why not take it? His father is sent away for 30 years but how does he escape and get back to Bruce? How is he able to work at the lab, even just as a janitor, without them knowing where he is? And what is the deal with him at the end? How is Bruce able to change back from being The Hulk to being normal Bruce? Nothing is cleared up correctly for the audience to clearly understand what is going on. Based on the issue of the special effects, the CGI is moderate. The Hulk seems pretty realistic at night and when he is slightly hidden in shadows but looks absolutely ridiculous in the desert and in broad daylight. The chase scenes are nothing more then an attempt to show off the CGI Hulk. Those scenes do nothing but make the story go around in circles. One doesn't see a problem with a giant green monster flying through the air? Ang Lee is a great director with his work on Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but The Hulk is just a huge mess from beginning to end. Guess not all comic books characters are meant to be brought to the big screen.",Hulk
216,RolloTomasi,Too nice for its own good,8,24 June 2003,"SPOILERS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT (don't read if you haven't seen the film)For starters, I liked ""Hulk.""  It's a smart film, well directed with an efficient, economical script. The CG Hulk looks like clay-mation at times but most of the time feels like a genuine physical presence. This is due more to the way he acts and moves than the way the character looks together with real people, the texture of his skin, or how his hair blows in the breeze.The 'battle in the desert' sequence is the film's centerpiece, an impressive demonstration of how far ILM's technology has come in the ten years since ""Jurassic Park."" There are many elements to the sequence, which goes beyond just special effects and action for action's sake to actually reveal a lot about the character. The Hulk persona is supposed to represent Banner's repressed childhood rage. As the Hulk, some part of Banner is still there. This gives him enough intelligence to, for instance, block the incoming tank shell with the turret he'd torn off another tank, or bite off the nose of the missile and spit it back at the helicopter. The childish rage is still there as well, though, in the way that he smashes the tank to bits with the torn-off turret, with the mannerisms of an angry 4-year-old smashing the toy that offended him. The vision Banner has near the film's end, in which the Hulk calls him a ""puny human"" in the mirror image, then crashes through, sets the stage for sequels, where the two (maybe more) personalities will begin to diverge. It suggests that not only is Banner aware of the Hulk, but the Hulk has become aware of Banner. Each will claim his exclusive right to exist, without the other. The script has some problems, but any story this fantastical has to cut a lot of slack anyway. One huge problem is the coincidence that Bruce Banner/Krenzler and Betty Ross end up together at Berkeley after also living at Desert Base with their respective families. This wouldn't be as big a problem if Banner had not been adopted and re-named Krenzler. It's just hard to believe the two would end up at the same college through sheer coincidence.I've been a fan of the Hulk character for many years. I still have a large collection of the comics. So I'm one of those fans the filmmakers didn't want to alienate. This is absurd, actually. Whether the adapted comic is X-Men, Superman, Batman, Hulk, or whomever, the first objective should be to make a good film. How much of the original source material you use should depend on how much of it lends itself to a good film narrative.The Hulk comic has evolved so much over the years that it would be hard to argue Ang Lee and James Schamus' loyalty to it one way or the other. Now that I've seen the film, I'd almost rather they took a gamble on straying even further from the comic. They've updated the story to modern times, made the Hulk more a creation of bio-technology than gamma radiation (they still manage to distance their ideas from the genetic mutation ideas of X-Men), and introduced 'nanomeds,' which are really what unleash the film Hulk. Going in, I was skeptical about this element because it's completely new. The idea of the nanomeds is that they seek out damage to the body and attach themselves to it. The introduction of radiation then activates them, causing cell regeneration. Banner and Betty come to the conclusion that the nanomeds somehow detect Banner's mental scars and 'heal' them by releasing the Hulk. If Lee and Schamus had the imagination and the vision to come up with this very very good idea, then I'd rather they went a step further and re-imagine the character around it. Instead they have taken all the same principle characters from the original comic and tried to wedge them into this updated Hulk scenario. This gets the script into trouble at times, like the Banner/Betty coincidence.The filmmakers use ideas from the comic and take them out of context. In the earlier years of the book, for instance, epic desert battles between the Hulk and the U.S. military, led by General Ross, were a regular staple. They indirectly introduce a regular Hulk villain, the Absorbing Man, by way of David Banner, Bruce's father. I do not recall the Absorbing Man's origin but I think it had something to do with a Norse god (he first appeared in the ""Thor"" comic, I think). At any rate it had nothing to do with gamma radiation. Also, in the comic, David Banner only ever appears in Bruce's memories. We know he's dead, but when and how he dies isn't revealed until a recent issue. I should just be glad they incorporated a classic Hulk villain, in some form or another, into the film version.
This is still a quality superhero adaptation, on par with the first ""Superman"" and the ""X-Men"" films. Story problems aside, it may have the smartest dialogue of any of them. I still think Bryan Singer's direction of the X-Men films tops Lee's work on Hulk. It just seems to come more naturally to Singer. The two franchises are completely different in their respective styles. Lee's work has an elegance and grace to it, maybe too much. The shots are carefully chosen, the action meticulously staged, but the director rarely seems to be having much fun. If any film needs to NOT seem at all docile, it's a film version of ""Hulk.""

218,randomStuff101,(extremely good 3D + action + mostly cool editing) - (lengthy uncool bits) = worth seeing,7,5 July 2003,"Amazing cgi fuels great action sequences. The HULK character is a thrill to watch. I was mezmerised by scenes starring the HULK, and wasn't distracted from the fact I was watching a big 3D render. Sure I marvelled in the known truth that this was all built by artists on computers, but I'd quickly get lifted out of that perception the next time a big close-up of HULK filled the screen.The details in the skin, movement, and expressions effectively prevent your mind from ""summing up"" what you see before you. There just isn't time to scan the image and build enough evidence against the illusion that HULK is in there with the actors.Not all HULK scenes are equal though! There is particularly a handful of scenes and moments where he looks spot on real, no question. Other times you might pick up on obvious 3D side effects, such as very slightly over-enhanced colour or lighting on HULK, or slightly exaggerated movement or odd momentum. 3D characters in other movies suffer from a definite animated-look. Luckily for the HULK, he mostly pulls off the illusion of really being in there on the set.Eric Bana plays a good Bruce. Some of the talking scenes are long, and you start wanting the HULK back! A lot of orchestral music - too much in movies today I think, and it puts me to sleep! It seems everything else in movies has evolved except sleepy orchestral soundtracks.Comic box editing effect a bit over-done, or not used very well, but it's cool. General editing and camera is still excellent. In the end you get the best 3D ever and one menacing green mofo!

219,adamsmith-51004,Hulk smash!,5,15 April 2021,"This film is a very mixed bag and I remember seeing at the cinema at the time it came out. It has got solid acting, pretty good special effects for 2003, a great soundtrack, and some stunning visuals. The problem comes mostly with the story. I admit that the movie earned my respect by focusing more on characters than the Hulk, but I wish it did more. There isn't a whole lot of development between the Hulk and Bruce Banner, one of the things that I really like seeing in Hulk movies. It would have mad it a lot more interesting, but unfortunately the movie bloats the runtime with a generic father-son dynamic that doesn't really pay off emotionally.Eric Bana and Jennifer Connally having very little chemistry with one another. Sometimes the acting is a little stiff, besides Nick Nolte. He comes off as a little out of place in the film, his extremely energetic and intense acting doesnt mix that well with the more stoic and reserved acting by the rest of the cast.The editing in the film is also quite odd, Ang decided to go for a more comic book panel style. It doesn't work tremendously well except for a few scenes, and it distracts the viewer from what they should be focusing on. The film would be a lot better without it.The villians in the movie aren't very compelling, and seem very out of place. The final battle is a CGI smackdown although its much more about the relationship and emotions of these two charactersSpeaking of the action, it can come across as lackluster. The Hulk doesn't look bad, but he doesn't seem like the rage monster he is in the comics. He's built like a giant toddler, and his face isn't that intimidating. The action is mostly Hulk fighting the military. Its shot pretty well, and its entertaining enough. The best fight was definitely the last though, having some beautiful cinematography and that awesome score by Danny Elfman. Overall, I'd say check it out if your a fan of the Hulk. It may not be your cup of tea, but I'd say for the average competent viewer, it'll be worth your while.",Hulk
220,GHCool,DO NOT SEE THE HULK!,1,20 June 2003,"It is EASILY the worst of the recent slew of comic book movie adaptations. It is astoundingly bad.  The first hour and a half could have easily been cut to about 10 minutes.  Everything that happens in that hour and a half is what and how the Hulk came to be.  Since the audience figures all of that out 10 times as fast as the characters do, I became extremely bored and impatient.  This is the first super hero movie I've ever seen that was boring.  Even bad super hero movies are at least entertaining, but not THE HULK.  The last half hour or so is basically the Hulk kicking ass, and that part of it is pretty cool, but even those parts of it were poor in comparison to similar scenes in X2 and SPIDER-MAN.The guy who plays Bruce Banner is the worst leading actor I've seen in the movies in recent years.  Keanu Reeves is like Lawrence Olivier compared to this guy.  Jennifer Connolly and Nick Nolte do what they can with their roles, but its hard to work with nothing.  The biggest disappointment is that Ang Lee, who's CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON was so wonderful, directed this.  I can't imagine Lee being proud of his work on this film.  Compare the scene with Hulk vs. the dogs in the trees with Chow Yun-Fat vs. Ziyi Zhang in the trees and you'll see a major difference in quality and human interest.One more thing: why do they do all of that split-screen crap? Every scene has this weird thing where the most minute action is shown from like 4 different angles at the same time.  Why? Its annoying and quickly wears out its welcome.  My guess is that they added that stuff later to make it seem like something interesting was happening, when, in fact, nothing interesting was happening at all.My Grade:1 out of 10",Hulk
221,TimBoHannon,A Good Idea Sent Astray,4,16 July 2008,"My, how opinions change. I have seen a host of movies multiple (multiple=at least three) times. For many, such as ""For Your Eyes Only,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" and many movie comedies and ""Seinfeld"" television episodes, I ask myself, ""Why am I not enjoying this the way I did before?"" In those cases, I realize that my view of the movie has not changed. For some reason, be it familiarity or lack of novelty, I simply don't have as good of a time seeing them. The quality of the movie has no bearing on my feelings. That is not the case with ""Hulk."" When I saw it in 2003, I enjoyed it so much that I put it on my Christmas list. When I saw it again recently, I asked myself that question once again. There is no innocent explanation this time. My fogged glasses have been wiped clean. ""Hulk"" is a bad movie.The most serious problem is director Ang Lee. He just couldn't keep his meddling hands off a wildly successful format that did not need updating or improvement. Tom Desanto, David Hayter and Brian Singer (writers and director of X-Men); and Sam Raimi and David Koepp (Spider-Man) understood both the quality of the material they were adapting and the desires of its fans. Lee and writers James Schamus, Michael France and John Turman either lacked that understanding or believed their vision would be superior to one that captivated readers for forty years. Imagine if Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman had radically altered James Bond in 1962. The series would never have gained wings, and some of my favorite movies would have never been made.Ever since the Hulk first appeared in May 1962, coincidentally one year before ""Dr. No"" opened in the United States, one of the center points was Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) possessing powers he does not want. He considered them a curse. In the comics, he gained his Hulkdom via an accident, not the sins of his wicked father, David (Nick Nolte). By making the David Banner storyline the axis the movie rotates about, Lee sucks out all life. Tragedy or not, Lee was dealing with a comic book, and even the saddest must have a sense of fun. Bana noted that the on set atmosphere was ""ridiculously serious and morbid."" The inclusion of the father is a titanic mistake.Just who is the villain anyway? General Thunderbolt Ross (Sam Elliot)? Ross may work against Banner, but he is not evil. ""You have my word I'll make sure he's cared for,"" he tells his daughter Betty (Jennifer Connelly) after placing Banner under house arrest. Note the words ""cared for,"" not ""dealt with."" ""You can trust me to do what I think is right,"" he declares later. He allows Betty to try helping Bruce. Buried under the calcified exterior and explosive temper resides concern for Banner's well being. He realizes that Banner's best interests are the same as Betty's and his own. His antagonism does not come from hatred, but fear: fear for Betty, for himself and for public safety.Is it Glenn Talbot (Josh Lucas)? He is puny. His pupils may as well be in the shape of dollar signs. Only greed motivates him, he is never a threat to Banner, and he lacks the resources of Ross and powers of a Marvel supervillain.Is it David Banner? Nolte is absent for too many long stretches. The movie is inconsistent with how he regards his son. Sometimes he weeps for him, at others he wants to kill him. There is a twist when David does something very stupid, but his motives are unclear. If I call his character development moronic, then I should receive a tax deduction for being charitable.The two action scenes receive a split decision.The first is a fight between Hulk and three mutant dogs. The magnitude of this poor decision defies words. I understand it comes from a comic issue, but that is no excuse. Imagine how audiences would respond if Spider-Man had defeated Sandman with a vacuum cleaner? That happened in one issue. The public would laugh in mockery if Columbia announced Kangaroo and Jack O'Lantern, the latter of whom uses a pogo stick, as the super-bad-guys for ""Spider-Man 4."" Just look up the villain roster on wikipedia and see how many come back from the dead or have four different people as the same character. Just because it is amusing in comic books does not make it acceptable material.A twenty-two minute chase involving Hulk running from tanks, helicopters and fighter jets provides the second. It probably swallowed half of the 137 million dollar budget, and it looks and sounds impressive. What follows does not.During Michael Apted's director commentary for ""The World is Not Enough,"" he stated that after Renard died, he needed to exit the movie quickly. Instead of doing so, ""Hulk"" wastes time on a pointless father and son meeting where David Banner screams nonsense like a psychotic who drank twenty Red Bulls. I can never again enjoy a Nolte performance.My problem is not that it is too cerebral, an accusation levied at the action fan by many professional critics. To paraphrase ESPN radio host Colin Cowherd, I don't root for any focus of a movie any more than a chef roots for a pork chop. I just want it to be a good pork chop. Lee sent this movie in the wrong direction. From start to finish, it is a bad meal.",Hulk

Slow-moving and boring. Jennifer Connelly wasn't interesting to me.  All the actors looked pale. The color of the film look faded.  But the most exciting of the film is the CGI HULK in raging action.  However some scenes go so fast you don't get to absorb every frame.  Nighttime scenes and underwater scenes are too dark to see what is going on.  That's a waste of CGI.  The HULK is only seen for a total of 20 to 30 minutes total.  Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno are in a cameo appearance.  It would have been nice to have given Mr. Ferrigno a funny bit to do that would have reminded us of his HULK days.  This film is nothing like ""The Incredible Hulk"" tv series (1978-1982) that starred Bill Bixby (may he rest in peace) and Lou Ferrigno.  The tv series had emotion.  I enjoyed the ending of this HULK film with the hope that there will be a HULK 2.  Now that the storytelling is out of the way we can move on to more action in HULK 2.

224,tbyrne4,Excellent. Don't let the naysayers fool you,9,29 April 2007,"Despite a few draggy moments and the somewhat somber tone, Ang Lee's adaptation of ""Hulk"" really shines. It's easily the strongest Marvel comic book adaptation I've seen, the most human and creative. All because of Lee, who is a stellar director and completely re-writes the book on how comic book films should be constructed.Frankly, most comic book films are silly and stupid. That's a fact. They are made by second rate hack directors who have very little strength or ability to put their own peculiar stamp on the material. We get lots of films like ""Daredevil"", ""Fantastic Four"", ""Elektra"", and ""X-Men"", and even the overrated, sub-par and hilariously stupid ""Spider-Man"" which has CGI so wretched it looks practically transparent. These films rush through plastic, hastily composed expository scenes headlong into disposable action scenes.""Hulk"" is completely different. This film has been imagined by a real film maker from the ground up. The film breathes and has a real life to it. The CGI is solid and dense. It seems to have weight and volume. The action scenes have a genuine sense of mass colliding against mass. This is what superhero films need.Filtering through it all are the recurring motifs of desert vegetation, reptile and marine life, and science. The hulk is basically a raging child, smashing everything and anything that gets in his way. It's exhilarating to watch, and yet through it all Lee brings to the film a strangely serene feeling. There is a sense of great freedom and peace underneath all of the anger. That's part of what makes it such a great film.Not to say that the film doesn't have a few problems. The script is needlessly convoluted and is sometimes ambiguous about who the bad guys are. And the strapping, inexpressive Bana is miscast as the main character: a nerdily repressed scientist. Also, kids may find it dull and its probably too violent for small tykes. Other than that, this is outstanding stuff.",Hulk

But people have bashed movies that I liked. So I watch movies with no bias. So when the movie started it looked promising. The opening credits were really well done. Probably 1 of the best uses of text intertwined with fx. But then as the movie progressed the problems became apparent.The opening sequence was actually part of the boring plot to explain how Bruce Banner's father caused him to become the Hulk. It was so boring! & furthermore unnecessary. The back story of a movie should not go beyond the opening credits. But no, the back story was HALF the movie! I'm sitting there wondering when the movie was going 2 begin. The first actual Bruce Banner to Hulk transformation is about 1 hour into the movie. In a movie simply titled ""Hulk"" there is little Hulk in it at all!For 1 hour we sit though pointless back story. The father was a scientist that experimented on himself even though he was told not to & passed on his mutated genes to his son. If I can summarize the back story in a sentence, it should not take 1 hour on screen! Wow. What was the point of the teen-aged Bruce Banner going to college scene? To show that he has an adopted mother? Well, that was covered in a conversation with Betty in the lab. That scene was totally pointless! They could have just shown Bruce's father injecting himself, then flash forward to Bruce in the lab. The 1st HOUR of the movie was unnecessary. I would try & defend this movie by saying that that this was in '03 & back then people did not know how to translate comic books to movies. But another comic book adaptation; ""Spider-Man"" (2002) came out A YEAR before & did a great job! One of the MANY problems this movie has is trying to be a comic book. What with all the pointless camera fx that just made it look cheap/confusing. Why did they show 2 angles of the same scene? Oh yes, in order to mimic a comic book, it's so blatant. But what they do not realize is that THIS IS A MOVIE NOT A COMIC BOOK! When you read a comic U have control over how fast u flip the pages. So it does not matter how much crap they try & cram into it. But in a movie you can't do that. You are not in control. You have to sit & wait for the story to unfold for u. That is why this movie is so tedious/boring. In a movie you have different tools to tell a story. The reason they show different angles in a comic book is because they have to. In film they can just pan the camera from one person to another to show who is in the room. But in a comic book that is not possible. They just draw two frames; one person's back to you & one facing you to show they are speaking to one another, & then the reverse for the other frame. Again, in a comic book cropping is welcome to fit all the frames into the pages. But in a movie it just looks like half the screen is blank, it just makes no sense simply put.& for ALL this back story we really learn NOTHING! We never even learn the NAMES of Bruce's parents! On IMDb Nick Nolte is listed as playing ""Father"". In the movie itself Bruce HIMSELF says that he never even knew his birth mother's name! Ugh, this movie just seems to be an exercise in film making. An experiment of its own, if you will. I could not believe my eyes at how empty the story was. So many things were happening, yet none of it was explained. We don't know the why & the who. Unexplained things: How did the father continue with the experiments after they shut him down? If the father was so smart why did he not just adopt? If the father did whatever his wife wanted why did he go against her wishes & try & kill their son? How did Betty know that Bruce was going to choke her? If the Hulk's skin is bullet proof why does he run from the guns/bombs? As you can see a lot was set up, but never explained. Perhaps they thought this was like a comic book. There will be more issues, or in movie terms many sequels.This review is getting pretty long. Sorry. But that's just the problem in this movie, too much going on with no explanation. Another complaint: they made the majority of the Hulk scenes in the desert. How convenient! It can all be CGIed with no regard to proportion. When Hulk was in the city he was underground. WHAT!? Then when he came above ground he stood very still, suddenly. As if the fx people did not want to deal with the buildings, the cgi, going frame by frame adding the Hulk & so on. You know; ACTUAL WORK! Lazy, lazy, lazy!I will end the review here as I have gotten a headache trying to even comprehend this mess!",Hulk
226,BiiivAL,Everything turned out to be too bad ...,7,4 June 2018,"Few people actually realized that this is not exactly a superhero action movie. More precisely, he is not superhero. After all, the Hulk has never really been a hero. Always in exile and persecution of enemies.And it was very skillfully shown by Eng Lee. He created what Christopher Nolan later did. As it turned out, the audience was not ready for the drama ""about comics."" Maybe it was simply not worth shooting this film by Eng Lee, although he portrayed the perfect drama. He showed the Hulk quite the other side.Personally, I am a sincere fan of this film, like comics in general. All as always waited for a passing summer ""militancy"", which they are feeding us up to now and will do it again. Everything turned out to be too bad ...Eric Bana did everything right, that would not say critics. He showed all the experiences of the hero as it was not in the comics, but as it would be in real life.Jennifer Connelly in my opinion did not show anything, except for some tears. Bad.Nick Nolty stood out most of all. He truly played the villain and father of Bruce Banner. The brightest figure in the film.I appreciate only the game of actors, since this is not an action.I'll put the film as a first-rate drama created by a first-rate director who later created the best drama in general (Brokeback Mountain):",Hulk
227,padiyark,"For the most part, a well crafted movie based on a comic",8,20 June 2003,"Many this summer were looking forward to the Matrix sequel. Others were looking forward to X2. I, myself, was dying to see the Hulk. The fact that Ang Lee was directing and the cast was made of actors of substance was reason enough to see it. I was lucky to see a midnight viewing of this movie, and my final reaction was...well done, but could have been a bit better.Now before taking my comments at face value, allow me to elucidate my comments. The first thing we see that makes this movie valuable is the ""24""-like editing of the movie. The movie's feel is like watching a comic book in action...that's smart...very smart. And just like a comic book, we get a prologue of how things lead to the present day. And like a comic book,we get periods of the surreal/dream sequences.Most fans' biggest concern was whether the CGI Hulk looked real enough. Well, let me put it this way...CGI Hulk is great. Hey, even CGI Gollum looked liked he didn't belong at points, and similarly with the CGI Hulk. And that isn't the fault of anyone...CGI just hasn't evolved to the point that it is totally realistic. But then again, most action scenes in Hollywood films don't look realistic either. Any effect requires a suspension of belief, and CGI Hulk is no different. And trust me, you won't be complaining when you see Hulk bitchslap the ""Hulk-dogs"" or make scrap metal of a whole tank battalion. As a matter of fact, the audience I was in was cheering the Angry Green Giant on.Which leads me to story. Making any comic book into a movie is a tough task. Take the movie the Hulk will be compared to: Spiderman. Most comics have a pretty good storyline, but when converted to film, they become an arena for showing off CGI can and mindless action. Not to dis' Spiderman, but connection to the character was missing. And that blame goes to the scriptwriter, not the director (David Koepp, who wrote Spiderman, has to be one of the laziest scriptwriters in the business: it's just that the movies that he scripts are ones with great hype). Hulk, on the other hand, is scripted by James Schamus, who gives adequate time to not only the Hulk, but the other characters in the script. He (as well as Ang Lee) take the time to understand the characters and their psyche. As a result, the Hulk doesn't become a ""Hulk Smash!""-fest, but rather a study on repression. Even the Hulk shows signs of intelligence behind the anger that creates him.Acting couldn't be better. Eric Bana takes the character of Bruce Banner to a new level from Bill Bixby's Banner (which was great to begin with). Jennifer Connelly shines as Betty Ross, and Sam Elliot is perfectly cast as General Ross. However, the best performance in the film goes to Nick Nolte as David Banner. For most actors, David Banner would be an excuse to go over the top, but Nolte does a fine job balancing the role of a loving father and mad scientist.So where's my complaint? Without giving too much away, it would have to be the climax. If anything, it is more of an anticlimax. After all the torment that Bruce Banner/Hulk go through, a more solid climax should have been achieved. And this is where one may argue ""artistic interpretation"", but the climax, apart from being incomprehensible (both in the physical sound and artistically), looks like it should have been part of a movie called ""Crouching Hulk, Hidden Banner"". It came off as too abstract for even a solid drama. Plus, being set in the dark doesn't help convey the point.On the whole, definitely a must-see. Definitely more intelligent than the pseudo-philosophy given in Matrix Reloaded. However, don't expect too much out of the climax. 8/10",Hulk
228,ichabod81,A super hero movie with feelings! The horror.. the horror..,8,27 May 2004,"Sometimes people disappoint me so hard it's almost depressing. I think one of the reasons this movie has such a bad reputation is the mouth-to-mouth effect. One person says it sucks a** and people go see it with that in mind. Many might even ""secretly"" like it, but because so many others say it sucks, they don't dare to admit that they actually love it. I know, because I used to be like that. You've got mail? Sleepless in Seattle? ""Sentimental tacky crap!"".. well now I know better. As a guy and a filmbuff I'm no-longer in any way ashamed to say I actually love those films.The Hulk is a great movie. It's obvious this film is maybe not as heavy on action as say Daredevil or X2. Why is that such a big problem?! I can almost hear the redneck college jocks in the back row going ""Dude, this sucks. Let's hit the road and go show our six-packs to hot chicks!"". As it was expected, director Ang Lee made a movie with real feelings, but there actually IS also lots of action to go around. As far as the performances are concerned, all is in place. Bana pulls off another class A job and Nolte has really outdone himself. And although Connelly is good too, her job is merely to be worried about Banner.If you haven't seen Hulk yet, give it a shot, but try to forget all the hype surrounding it. Start with a clean slate. It might disappoint you or you might love it. At least your opinion won't be based on others.**** / *****",Hulk
229,thehardyboyz2043,...zzz...zz..boring movie...zzz...,4,22 June 2003,"(Possible Spoilers) Anyone who wants a detailed version of the plot look at another review, this one's simply a bashing session.  Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" has got to have the most boring exchanges of dialogue in recent film history, the actors seem like they would rather be someplace else (though not nearly as bad as the cast of ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"") but it's still pretty painful to watch sometimes. Eric Bana is okay as Bruce Banner, Jennifer Connelly (""A Beautiful Mind"") is sorta dull as Banner's ex-flame Betty Ross , Sam Elliott is way to dull as an Army general whose also Betty's father and Nick Nolte as Bruce's father just sounds wasted whenever he talks and that's when you can understand him. The movie takes way too long explaining the origin of Bruce and by the time he transforms into the Hulk, about 45 mins. in I was about bored to tears. The only time I was even sitting up in my chair was when the Hulk was running from a couple of Army helicopters, while hopping throughout the canyons of Arizona or somewhere in the southwest. Then the movie lags back into more dull discussions, that finally drove me to the point where I just wanted the film to end and it seemed to last forever, especially after the last action sequence, the next scene where Betty and her father talk via cell phone just about drove me mad, because it was so pointless. The special effects were nice, the Hulk looked real (well about as real as a 10-15 foot green monster can look), though the Hulk dogs looked absolutely terrible and as I said before the sequence where he's evading the Army was intense.  This was a terrible movie for the most part, the only saving grace were the special effects. If there happens to be another one, take this in mind, less talking, more hulking. *1/2 out of 4 stars.",Hulk
230,Rooster99,"Pretty good, cartoonish, but I suppose that was intended",6,15 October 2003,"It's too bad Ang Lee decided to spend so much time on character development. Normally, that wouldn't be a bad thing in a movie, in fact the opposite is a very common complaint.  However, in this case, we are talking about a comic book superhero!  No need to waste too much time on how he came to be the Hulk, just get right to the bashing and the smashing.The CGI effects in this movie are impressive.  Unfortunately, in my humble opinion, there are not enough of them.  I fully expected that in 2.5 hours, there would be numerous Hulk fight scenes.  I can't complain about the scenes they did have, there simply were not enough of them.  More than half the movie goes by before the Hulk makes his first appearance, and then most of the rest of it is the Hulk being chased by helicopters.  A few battles with dark forces along the way wouldn't have been a bad idea.Jennifer Connelly is excellent in her role, but who was really watching her ?  We were all waiting for the big green man!  And did anyone notice that the Hulk was very different in size in some scenes, and smaller in others? I know that he is supposed to get bigger the madder he gets, however in some scenes, like when he trashes the lab, he easily fits in a room.  Yet when he is breaking out of the military facility, at one point he comes out of the circular open elevator hatch and can barely fit through the opening.  Just moments before we had seen Bruce Banner go down that same elevator inside a hyperbaric chamber accompanied by at least 8 armed guards.  Now he is so big his fist is almost as big as the opening.  At any rate, it didn't detract from the movie as a whole, it's just an observation.A good adventure flick, has rewatch value, worth the price of the DVD.  I'd give it a 6/10.",Hulk

Well this Hulk is brilliant. No other comic-book inspired movie is so well done (except maybe Terry Zwigloff's ""Ghost World""), so close to the original spirit. The image is great, the 3D is close to Jack Kirby's drawings, and we feel all the angriness and the strength of hulk... Very good. Do not take little kids to see it, some parts are really frightening, like a dog attack scene.",Hulk

233,ChrisTreborn,"""The Worst movie ever happened in this Century.""",1,1 March 2005,"How can I write Review on this Carp.Well let's see, First up all..Judge yourself before reading this page,You are O.K /not doing well You are Male/Girl You are a Fan/non Fan of Comic/Non Comic Hollywood Films Even this quality is not present in you..Till you can't enjoy this movie..The Hulk (Spoilers******)Spawned from the old Marvel comic and a cultish 1970's television show, the first film adaptation of the character was presented to Taiwanese-born Ang Lee, the acclaimed director behind Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Sense and Sensibility. Lee accepted the request of Universal studios by walking away from the Terminator 3.rd installment. This makes the movie one of the most anticipated celluloid of 2003.Created by Marvel God Stan Lee the original plot tells the story of a scientist; who transforms in to a monster due to an accident during experiment. But the movie talks about the plot in a more twisted way, dealing with something personal. It takes from the Hero's (Bruce Banner (Eric Bana)) childhood days. His father David Banner (Nick Nolte) being a manic on his experiment finally test his medicine on his own child. By giving some extra antigens which responds to Gamma radiation that Bruce happened to encoder in his matured states, makes him the Most dangerous humanly similar creature ever.. to walk on the planet Earth.Scripted by Michael France, James Schamus and John Turman for the story of James Schamus himself, make the worst movie experience of the life time.Ang Lee consider as a visionary director who did Oscar winning Sense and Sensibility, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon; totally messed up this plot. The feeling of the studio was that Lee would use his strongly rooted sense of drama to keep The Hulk as character-driven as possible, without allowing the film to digress into a CGI spectacle. Ironically, the studio eventually claimed that there wasn't enough action --not to mention a fan uproar about a rather fake-looking CGI hulk-- and Lee pulled his hair out in frustration over the project.He uses Brian De Palma styles: using split screens in the story telling. I don't know why Lee did that, may be he wanted an art film told in a comic, fast cutting style. What ever he planned, he failed to give a solid rhythm in the screenplay. Also he forgot the main character Hulk by giving more importance to its human side. He forgot that what is Hulk, why everyone calls him Hulk, can he speaks? Yes he speaks in a child, mentally retread type words, but in the movie not a single voice is heard from his mouth. Did Ang Lee plan for a King Kong movie? Also the hulk was such a worst unrealistic CGI work ever happened in any movies. ILM moved their name into worst list.But the worst part beyond that was the actor who played its human side, Mr. Eric Bana. He did a crap work for performing the anger side of the beast. A total miscast in the title role. He really sucked in that role. Eric's face full of dead emotions; a bad actor with dead expressions.While Nick Nolte did a nice work as the feeling father and the twisted scientist in the same time, were Josh Lucas did this film for Money. Only thing good in this movie was Jennifer Connelly as (ex) girlfriend Betty Ross. She is an eye candy in this 3hr boring disaster.Mean time Danny Elfman have the chance to change that 'boring disaster' to 'a disaster' if he provide a good soul for the movie. The Background score was really messed up, I can't believe that it was composed by Elfman. The score was mixed with dull and dry sound adding the vocals of Natacha Atlas to represent the Betsy Ross character; it's hard to figure why a classy male vocalist wasn't employed instead. If you can throw aside the popularity of female vocals for a moment, then it could have been a very effective change to hear a wordless male vocalist represent Banner's emotions. A true fault from Elfman while he offers some adequate action underscore, but throws the project off balance with his selection of styles and instruments.Only thing happened good in this movie was for Terminator Fans. They are Lucky. WHAT would have Happened if Lee done TERMINATOR 3. James Cameron must HAVE KILLED HIM! All in all see Hulk the movie CRAP, if you want to get bored that much.The Hulk = Bad script from a Good plot went to a non-American sucking director.",Hulk
234,changingshades,This movie is the cinematic equivelent of a floater,3,22 July 2003,"GReen and sloppy and just refuses to go down. No one likes this. They say the acting is bad, they say the effects are more short yellow bus special than light saber special, they say the story could have been written by a 12 yr old and that ang lee has sold out and that there is no redeeming quality other than 2 things going for her, but I'd rather watch the rocketeer for those,they were more perky back then. so I'd have to agree with all of that, with specific blame give special blame to Nick Nolte. So, will this be the worst film of the year.

235,MinorityReporter,Nice special effects! Good acting! Terrible editing!,5,13 November 2005,"Hulk is yet another Marvel hero translated to the big screen and where it is not a failure altogether it is not an undisputed success either. In short there were things I liked and there were things that I didn't like.I like Ang Lee's approach to the film by letting the characters have the main focus. A lot of time is taken in building up the characters so they become believable and important to the viewers. This is partly because the actors are very good. Eric Bana who has since gone on to star in Troy does a good job in portraying the vulnerable and scarred scientist, Bruce Banner. He comes across pretty nerdy but unlike Peter Parker in Spider-Man, he doesn't overdo it. He also portrays the changes the character goes through in a satisfactory manner. Jennifer Connely is good as well but I think the character resembles her previous character from A Beautiful Mind a bit too much. Sam Elliot plays General Ross and does so with a lot of authority and it works to an extent because sometimes the character is reduced to simple anger and that is in my opinion not the best way of portraying the character which could have done with some poise. The best performance out of the bunch is undoubtedly Nick Nolte who is not only extremely menacing but also multi layered as Bruce Banner's father. He has a few explosions of incredible acting that left me gasping for air but he also knew when to be subtle and let someone else take control of the scene. A very fine performance.The effects are good. Not the best I've seen but good. Ang Lee tried to make the film seem as real as possible instead of trying to create a comic book atmosphere like Sam Raimi did in Spider-Man. The Hulk itself is well done. Not superb like Gollum from LotR but still very impressive. A thing which I thought was very distracting was the film's way of letting people know it was in fact a superhero movie. It does so by sometimes letting the screen be divided into several boxes like on a comic book page. I felt this was very disturbing and took away focus from the characters in the scenes where it occurred.I have to comment on Danny Elfman's music as well. I have to say that this is not the best he has done. The score resembles the score from Red Dragon a lot. It was still good but in my opinion not quite up to the usual high standard of Elfman's work. He was probably hired because he did the music for both Batman (1989) and Spider-Man which are both excellent musical scores and Hulk does have a few good points but it is much more forgettable than in the other films.Where the film truly suffers is in the fact that it is just too slow. Even though I like the fact that time is taken to build up the characters and make them believable 20 minutes could have easily been left out on the editing board. Not just character driven scenes but also effects scenes which seemed to drag on forever. The film was just too slow at times and that made the film suffer a lot. I'm not addicted to action but I do think that it is possible for pacing to be too slow which is probably why I don't like too many old films and the pacing is too slow in this film which in my opinion almost ruins the film. I couldn't help but yawn several times in spite of the good acting. Also the climax of the film wasn't all too great either. It felt kind of rushed and was over in 3 minutes. With all the action in the film I would have liked a more action packed ending.In conclusion I have to say that Hulk had potential. Hulk had vast potential. It could have been one of the best superhero movies as both acting and effects were good but the pacing was just too unbearable. Ang Lee told a good story but because of the poor pacing it didn't quite catch me and that really is a shame. If a sequel does come along I hope they hire another editor.5/10",Hulk
236,bobbyelliott,Lost opportunity,5,20 July 2003,"I like Ang Lee. He's an intelligent director. So I was looking forward to ""Hulk"". But I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's OK - and certainly better than most recent comic book adaptations (such as ""Spiderman""). But he seems to have produced a film that is neither one thing or another.""Hulk"" is an odd mix of adult characterisation and childish action flick. I wish he had tried to produce a film for adults - and fully developed the ""angry man"" theme. But instead, he does a bit of characterisation, some action stuff and a little romance - which doesn't hit the spot on any count.On the plus side, the comic-book effects are original and very effective. But this movie will be quickly forgotten.A wasted opprtunity.",Hulk
237,HBeachBabe,the non-comic-book comic book movie,8,23 June 2003,"The hardest thing about any 'super hero comic book' movie is setting tone. It's finding a way to bring the audience into a world where costumed superpowered being exist and people accept it.  DC solves this problem off the bat by setting their stories in fictional places.  From the outset the audience is willing to accept the fantastical because we don't have to take that extra step of saying ""there's nothing in New York like Superman""Marvel has made it more difficult by putting their fantastical characters into real world locations.  We all know what New York or San Francisco are like and we all know that superbeings do not roam the streets (despite what the national enquirer might say).So finding the tome becomes paramount.  In Spider-man, the tome was very comic-book-y.  Sure it was New York, but the characters, the places, science were all over the top - heightened.  We accepted the reality because we are told from the beginning, it's a comic.  X-Men went the other direction, playing it as close to real as possible.  We are simply told at the beginning that mutants exist but otherwise we are introduced to a New York that is the same as what we know.  Daredevil's biggest failing was it's inability to balance 'playing it straight' vs. 'it's a comic book'Which brings us to the Hulk, probably the most cerebral of the bunch while simultaneously being the most comic-like in look.  The first half of the movie is completely Hulk-free and plays out in the confined spaces of laboratories and bedrooms.  There is talk of genetic engineering and strained father-child relationships.  The relationships between all 4 main characters to each other is laid out wonderfully, each person having a conflict with each of the other 3.  If one didn't read the marquee before entering, you could almost be fooled into thinking that this was a drama about the ethical implications of genetic research and the personal lives of the people involved.  It's no surprise people wanting to see 'HULK SMASH' are getting bored with the first hour of the film.  The wait is worth it though.  When Bruce Banner finally transforms the first time, our anticipation of the event has been raised to such a point that the scene can't possibly fail - we are satisfied simply by seeing the big green guy bust stuff up.  The string of action scenes that follow, including a fight with 3 'hulked-out' dogs and later the desert chase are all perfectly staged and the CGI work is seamless and believable.  Unlike Spider-man, who too often came across like a rubber ball lacking any weight, Hulk has weight and mass.  Even when jumping miles, or deftly outrunning military choppers, the CGI works because Hulk's abilities have been slowly and carefully established.  Also, our emotional attachment to Bruce has been developed far more than had we simply been given Hulk in the first 10 minutes.  By the time he does transform, we care about how it affects him as a person as well as being wowed by the effects.There is an odd scene in the final act where Nick Nolte seems to think he's in 2 man stage play and must project to the back row.  It's the one moment that feels out of place despite it's necessity to set up the final conflict.The visual look contrasts the reality of the events.  The locations on screen are 'real'  We recognize them as 'a lab' 'a family room' 'a cabin' but the editing, both in scene transitions and use of split screen gives even the most dramatic scenes the feel of panels in a comic.  It wouldn't have surprised me in the least to see a big hand come across the screen and turn the page to the next scene.  For me, this blend of reality and comic book worked wonderfully.There are flaws of course.  General Thunderbolt's motivations and at times his objectives seem unclear and immoral scientist cum businessman Talbot seems more a pesky nuissence than a full-fledged adversary.No doubt this is a heady film, more along the lines of the first X-Man movie and light years from the video-game fun of Spider-man.  Hulk is a comic book action movie for the art house crowd.  For some, that's a match made in h-e-double hockey sticks, for others, like myself, the intellectual aspects of the film mirror the intellectual enjoyment we get from reading an intelligent comic.",Hulk
238,jkd15-1,Better than the second.,8,12 July 2008,I write this after seeing the second. The first iteration of the Hulk series is much better than the second. The acting and interaction between characters is better with more feeling. The hulk is much truer to form in this the first movie than the terribly nicknamed re-boot which is a stupid nickname. Very good character development and though action is somewhat delayed it tears into an awesome display of strength and power.Watch the 2nd one then watch the first and you'll see what I mean.I was on the edge of my seat in the first one in many of the scenes and was thoroughly entertained.The representation of the Hulk monster is much more comic book like and truer in the 1st than in the 2nd.,Hulk
239,Zingbot_9000,I enjoyed it,7,23 June 2003,Although I do agree that some of the CGI was bad.  I watched the making of the Hulk on the Sci-fi channel last night after seeing the movie and I understand why.  Ang Lee acted out the moments in a suit that captured his moves and later had them enhanced with computer graphics.  He moved too fast almost like a karate movie.  I felt that the Hulk sometimes moved to fast and it probably came from Ang's movements.  The CGI animators really only put on the screen what Lee gave them.  But that being said the movie still worked and some of the special effects were amazing.  I was able to look past it.Now some are complaining about the setup and the amount of time it takes before you actually see the Hulk (45 minutes).  Did you people see Superman? Spiderman? Batman?  There was less setup time in this movie then most super hero movies.  The setup time here was definitely needed.  I watched the tv series but did I know how Banner became the Hulk?  I didn't. So that part of this movie was very entertaining to me. One guy says that he didn't see Hulk save anyone?  What were you watching? He saved Jennifer Connolly in the movie.  Did you go get popcorn during that part?  Worst movie ever made?  Come one guy.  You don't get out much do you?The story for this movie was really good.  The movie was 2 hour and 15 minutes and it was a fast 2 hour and 15 minutes.  I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a super hero movie.  Kinda reminded me of King Kong. Another one - how long did it take before King Kong appeared????   There is more to the story then a big green guy going around destroying things.  7 out of 10.,Hulk
240,tendobear,Incredible!,10,14 January 2013,"I don't care what anybody else thinks, but I absolutely love Ang Lee's version of The Hulk. I think the Hulk story plays perfectly to Lee's strengths and the kind of stories he likes to tell. The Hulk is more than just a superhero movie, in fact, I'd like to think that it's NOT a superhero movie, I'll leave that to Louis Leterrier's The Incredible Hulk - which is just dumb, loud entertainment. This is a story of suppressed emotions, freedom and the power to take our destinies into our own hands. As with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Lee explores the things that makes us prisoners of ourselves and what it takes to free us. In Crouching Tiger, the girl secretly practices martial arts, so when she winds up in the possession of a legendary warrior's sword she runs away and lives the life she always wanted to live. Her prison was tradition and arranged marriage, the sword represented her key to freedom. For the Hulk, Bruce Banner's prison is himself, all the repressed memories and trauma from his childhood, he's set free when an accident in his lab exposes him to gamma radiation, hence unleashing the true nature he never knew he had. The Hulk is the key to his freedom. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, and it does get slow in parts, but if you're looking for a smarter more cerebral ""superhero"" movie, then Hulk's your bag.",Hulk
241,argimlumani,A green turd,1,16 December 2019,Im baffled at these reviews anyone claiming this film is a masterpiece this film is garbage ang lee is a pretentious art house film maker who was given the reigns to a comic book film about a big green monster and suprise he managed to make it boring as heck its shocking how bad this film is Nick nolte plays some weird homeless nut job who has trained super dogs Eric bana sucks as an actor which is why he didn't break out into a big star after this film he has no range whatsoever Jennifer Connolly is pretty to look at thats it and sam Elliot stars as sam Elliot so if you suffer from insomnia I reccomend this movie,Hulk
242,brailsford,It's a movie about the Hulk,6,7 October 2016,"It's not as campy as the TV movies but its during that time period before marvel had plans for a Cinematic universe and it comes off feeling like a big budget horror movie gone horribly wrong moreso then a comic book hero movie (think manbeast with more more put into it)This movie tell the history of how Bruce Banner became the hulk such as how his dad made him, how Thadeus Ross got obsessed with taking him down, and his love interest and other personal interaction with Betty Ross.The movie is extremely serious in tone most of the time not much like the later incredible hulk movie. That said some of the things come across as extremely silly (like a giant mutated poodle) or his father's reaction to the radiation turning him into whatever it was he became at the end, not sure he had a physical form. The film wasn't bad per-se but it was also kind of long and not exactly a huge pay off for the story... it ending with what possibly makes an indirect prequel to the incredible hulk.Its not really worth a watch if you don't like sci-fi horror or the hulk.",Hulk
243,Aomalle27,"Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad.....",1,9 May 2008,"Ang Lee might be a talented visionary of the scenic tapestry, and landscape of the earthly environs, but this film just stinks. What a mess of a great source material. Man versus self is one of the most common film formulas, and here is the perfect vehicle to further that motif. But Lee manages to invest too much time in the wrong backdrop to pull of the subtlety required to accomplish that task. The Hulk is the moody, irritable, gamma-infused alter ego of Bruce Banner. A freak accident causes the genetic makeup of our protagonist to be horribly changed. Intense emotion, especially anger, triggers a chemical change in Banners body, that transforms him into the immense monster called the Hulk. Lee should have used heavy doses of dark light to enhance the dark tone of the character. Instead he chooses to try to ""comic"" it up, showing the campy cgi Hulk in bright light, and greatly diminishing his awe value. Besides that, the plot of the mad scientist father of Banner, and the unbelievably poorly executed love angle with his lady love Betty, makes this an unwatchable film.",Hulk
244,tvspace,"A confused, misshapen blob of a movie",3,20 June 2003,"I'm a big Ang Lee fan.  The Ice Storm is one of my favorite movies. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was one of my favorite movies of that year. I even liked his Civil War ""flop"", Ride With the Devil.I've seen enough of Lee's work that I knew that filming the Hulk was a big step outside his demonstrated areas of expertise, but I hoped that I'd at worst see something that was a competent genre movie, or, perhaps, a soft-focus, oblique recasting of the comic-book genre, which might be more in keeping with Lee's previous stylistic choices.The Hulk is instead a complete mess.  It is a movie that at times is not even competent, a purple prose disaster of bad acting, crappy writing, cheesy dialog, second-rate computer graphics and flabby editing, all set to a grating Danny Elfman score (is there any other kind?) that keeps you wandering to the bathroom for a breather.Let's step back a minute, though:  at the very least the Hulk's flaws are a breed apart from the usual idiotic, smart-alecky, low-brow routine that we are usually treated to when we go to an American action movie.  Indeed, despite the fact that the Hulk is a pitiful concoction of a finished product, it would be fair to say that it is considerably less irritating to sit through than your typical Hollywood action film, which, while more professionally crafted in certain ways, is infinitely more predictable and more stupid than anything Lee has put up on the screen.Put another way, The Hulk is so bad that it keeps surprising you with how bad it gets.  It keeps you on your toes that way, keeps you thinking, keeps you asking yourself, ""what next?""But there are some details that leap out at me as admirable.
Lee makes the Hulk into a bipolar maniac, by turns uncontrollably violent, at others sweet and melancholic.  His Hulk is a descendent of the original Frankenstein, the mad scientist's creation who, unable to express with words the troubles that haunt his soul, instead expresses himself with bursts of action (violence).  The animation provided of the Hulk's emotive features is occasionally quite compelling and sensitive.Lee shows signs of developing a style of comic-book filmmaking that is the most direct tranlation of the comic book aesthetic to film from this emerging genre yet seen (unless you want to put forth the original television Batman with it's ""POW!""-style as the top of the class).
Lee frames the camera in extreme angles, pushing in on a face until the jaw and brow are cut off, in ways that directly mimic the expressionism of certain comic panels.  He employs split-screen effects to suggest the layout of panels on a comic book page.  At times you are even tempted to attribute the worst acting performances to an attempt to mimic a certain over-the-topness and two-dimensionality associated with comics.The problem with Lee's approach is that it tugs in different directions: while there is a heavy element of visual style that is meant to give the movie the literal feel of a comic book, at other times the movie is extremely prosaic, carelessly photographed, and slumberingly paced.  Some scenes are so low bugdet that they don't even quality as looking ""indie""; instead they look like a forgettable student film from a not-very-promising student.Still, early in the movie there was some hope that Lee was actually trying to pull a weird hat trick:  to juxtapose the heavily stylized comic-panel look with a gritty realism, sort of the opposite of your average Hollywood translation, which takes all the fantastic, slick action of a comic book, but scraps the extreme stylistic tics that demarcate that particular medium.After a while, though, the movie reveals itself to be simply careless and poorly put together.  The plot quickly unravels into an impenetrable, exploding mess (how complicated does a plot really need to be, anyway, when you're talking about comic book heroes?); the actors seem to modulate between two extreme states: fidgeting uncomfortably in front of the whirring camera, or eating the scenery with Wagnerian monologues; and soon the director is felt being dragged along by some unseen, clumsy force which is making his movie for him.  Perhaps this movie is The Hulk's movie about Ang Lee, and not the other way around, you think, in which case, you wish the Hulk would have gone to film school.",Hulk
245,claudemercure,not nearly as bad as is rumoured,7,22 April 2005,"Gets an A for effort.The filmmakers tried hard to make an intelligent movie that emulates the style of a comic book. They succeed on both counts - the characters and relationships have depth, and the visuals are dynamic and fun.But the realistic characters are actually a bit of a problem, perhaps because that's not what comic books are about. The way straightforward drama clashes with extraordinary events will at times make what's happening on screen seem quite silly. Also, plot-wise, exactly what happens at the climax is unclear.As for the Hulk himself, the special effects, though not amazing, are fine.",Hulk
246,knifeintheeye,could have been great,6,17 April 2005,"This should have been a humdinger of a movie. It had everything you'd want in a popcorn movie--gorgeous leading lady (hello Jennifer!!)and hunky eye candy for the ladies (Nick Nolte.Just kidding, Eric Bana.)It had a big mean green fighting machine in the Hulk and lots of stuff for him to smash. At times it was even directed as if it was a comic book (neat idea!). Somehow it never worked out. The character played by Nick Nolte was awful, played no useful role in the movie and killed all momentum that was generated. Cut out every mention of his character, every scene he's in and the movie would jump to 8/10. (Hello shortened directors cut!?) NICK NOLTE KILLED THIS MOVIE. Sam Elliott chews up the scenery and is always fun to watch. Jennifer Connelly is smashingly beautiful (and a wonderful actress) as the love interest Betty Ross. Eric Bana makes an interesting choice for Bruce Banner. More buffed then would be expected based on the comics, but he's a good actor modifying his role to suit himself. The character of the Hulk was impressive. Some didn't like the computer generated Hulk, I did. Hulk battling the tanks and the creatures...generally causing mayhem is what the fans want to see. Too bad the director thought we wanted a such a long back story. Hulk is mayhem, uncontrolled rage. The movie title is 'Hulk', not 'Banner"". A great premise for a movie derailed by a bad tacked on character with far too much screen time.",Hulk
247,elu5iv3,Boring and extremely disappointing,5,4 July 2003,"The Hulk: 5/10A hyped up movie, and a very disappointing one. I wanted to like The Hulk, but found myself outright bored. As a self-admitted fan of seeing special FX movies once, I thought I'd dig this, but nope. The first hour was spent building up to the inevitable ""Hulking Out"" of Bruce Banner. The build-up might have been fine if it wasn't so dry and if a wooden, beyond boring Eric Bana wasn't in the lead role. The movie picked up with the action scenes, which is all it's really good for, but other than one particular sequence in the desert/mountains, even some of those were flat (especially when he fought a bunch of pumped up dogs). The best actor was Nick Nolte as Bruce Banner's dad, and he played a convincing role as the somewhat nutty ex-scientist. Everyone else bored me. One of the coolest parts of the movie was a guest cameo by Lou Ferrigno (who played a security guard, passed Banner and said ""hey"" in his only appearance of the flick), which was a nice ""inside"" touch. Special mention goes out to a hilariously bad and contrived ending, which may set up a sequel if this does well. The trailer looked great, but the movie was boring overall, and 137 minutes was waaay too long. I just wanted it to end.",Hulk

I first saw it when it was released in 2003, I was 10 I didn't full understand it, but regardless I love it a ton, it was the best version of Hulk made by Hollywood at the time, I didn't know any better. As the years went on the Hulk would return in 2008, with the reboot The Incredible Hulk, which I saw on my 15 birthday and I loved it even more then this one. The point I'm getting at is for many years after both Hulk movies had been out for a long time, I started to hate this one as I felt it was inferior to the 2008 film, which I still feel it is, but having recently rewatched it, I felt the love and appreciation for it that I felt back in 2003, despise changes Ang Lee made to the script I don't agree with, its still an excellent adaptation, even with the serious tone and little to no humor anywhere. Eric Bana does and fantastic job and Jennifer Connelly is absolutely gorgeous, and perfect as Betty. 9/10 for me.",Hulk
250,DragonMasterHiro,A hulking wreckage of a movie.,1,23 June 2003,"I'm sorry, but for me this film was a huge disappointment.  While I liked the 'split screen comic book style action', the dark aspect of the film, and Eric Bana in the role of Bruce Banner, I found the rest of the film to be quite boring.  I'm not a person who needs constant action in a movie.  I love a good plotline that grows but this one dragged on for way too long. It didn't live up to all the hype and it seems wrong it was marketed to kids so much when the movie comes across in a mature nature. Nick Nolte, in my opinion, was horrible.  People in the theatre were laughing at because he was overacting so much.  I haven't read a lot of the comics but I did see the TV Series and the movie (with Bill Bixby).  I would have liked to see the movie go more of the route with Bruce Banner trying to keep his transformations a secret rather than the government constantly shooting at him for a half hour. I went to a free screening of this movie, so I'm glad I didn't have to shell out any money for it.",Hulk
251,CheshireCatsGrin,Angst Lee,7,17 July 2004,"The movie poster says it all.  This movie is that dark. Not just emotionally, but visually as well.  And that is the first of many problems with this film.Lee never finds his audience.  Is the fans of the comic book? If so, he should have stayed true to the original. Or Superhero fans? If so, get rid of the majority of the mental anguish that accompanies The Hulk in the comic books and go with Hulk of Saturday Morning TV.  Is it action fans? Then why the whole study of Banner as a person and lack of a 'real' love interest?
Acting was as good as I'd expect from Bana (playing Banner-Hulks human form) considering he had to play against a CGI counterpart.  As always, he impressed me.  Connelly was as good as the role allowed her.  Thought she did well in the hospital scene where she tells Banner she was watching him die.Nolte played our villain well, and he scared me.  Sometimes the real humans can scare me worse than Dr. O from Spiderman.The panels worked well.  I liked that touch. It reminded me this was a comic.But it never really found its way to a decent movie. From the darkness, to breaking the 180 degree rule, Lee was trying too hard to make art out of entertainment.  And he never pulls it off. Not even close.  If I was not a Bana fan (the guy can act his way out of a cardboard box) I'd never have sat through this movie.",Hulk
252,ARTaylor,Two Styles Poorly Combined,5,11 May 2011,"The problem with Hulk is that it was trying to be an art-house film for a summer blockbuster crowd. At one point it's trying to be a psychological film then a balls-to-the-wall action.The actors were fine with what they were given. I liked Bana as Banner and wouldn't have mind seeing him return. Elliot was a good Ross. I liked how he wasn't portrayed as such a straight-forwards villain like the Hurt version.Lee does have a definitive style. The film certainly does look good. Sure the split screen, comic book does put me out of the film, but there's a certain style to it all.I do like all the action stuff. I enjoyed the CGI, and never really got why people berated the Hulk so much.It's just that all the action is in conflict with the tone of the film. You got this odd fight with VW-sized poodles and then some weird scene where Nolte is talking about his wife and a knife ""becoming one.""Either Lee should have stuck with a cerebral, indy style movie or gone full force into the summer action film. But the two are just too conflicted. I'm not saying that a Hulk movie needs to be big, loud, and dumb. Bill Bixby's series proved that an intelligent Hulk adaptation can work in live action. But the way it was done here just made it seem schizophrenic.My rating: 5. 8 for the effort, 2 for execution.",Hulk
253,ivony,Cannot believe the positive reviews...,3,3 July 2003,"Given my summary, no doubt anyone reading further has a pretty good idea of what I'm about to say.  The Hulk sucked.  Bad.  I mean, Toxic Avenger held my interest far longer than The Hulk ever did.  And that's just downright sad.  Now, to be fair, the acting was well done and I have no real issues in that department.  Eric Bana played a believable enough Bruce Banner. Nick Nolte is as good as he ever is and is incredibly creepy in his role as Bruce's father.  Now, let's get to the storyline.  Ok, I have to admit I was disappointed to see some changes, but they weren't anything I couldn't deal with; nor was it enough to truly detract from the movie.  In and of itself, the storyline was, well, ok.  Not fantastic, not great, not awesome, but ok. I can live with that.So, if not the acting or storyline, what was so bad about the Hulk?  The unbelievably ridiculous excuse for CG, that's what.  Toy Story looked more ""real"" than any moment of CG in The Hulk.  It was absolutely pathetic. Basically, the CG reduced The Hulk to nothing but a cartoon on steroids. Based on the trailers, I had a pretty good idea that was going to happen, but I held out hope.  Unfortunately, that hope was short-lived as the movie turned out to be exactly what I feared it would.  The fight scenes were reminiscent of King Kong being attacked by the airplanes or the end battle in Mortal Kombat 2.  Horrible and most of all, super cheesy.Please, don't waste 8 bucks on this one.  At the very least, wait until it hits the dollar theatre and use the other seven for popcorn and soda...it'll be far more worth it.  I'm not even giving this one stars.",Hulk

I must say, Ang Lee surely did a great job on directing the movie. I can't wait to play the video game! The Hulk is action-packed and Hulk's just causing mayhem and destruction! Great job, Marvel!

255,bastiaan0740,A CGI hero?,1,16 September 2008,"Okay. I've seen a lot of movies in my life. Some were good, some were bad. Yet I always finished them. Once I started watching them, even if they turned out to be bad, I still watched them through. Thinking they could get better anytime. I even went through 'gayniggers from outer space'. That says a lot.Not so with this one. This movie has the rare honor of being the only movie I just gave up on. Ever.And I can't really figure out why. I love action movies. I love superhero movies. Loved the new batmans, fantastic 4's, spidermans, ironmans, even transformers, daredevil and the new superman. I also loved the Hulk series and the previous b-movies.I remember how anxious I was when I first started to watch the movie. I was home with a friend, also a Marvel comics fan. The movie premiered on TV. I made it half through. So did he. The movie was still on, but we just stopped watching it.I tried again a few years later, when it was played again. I decided to really force myself through it. But, the same thing happened - I gave up halfway.Might be because the hero is CGI. CGI can hurt a movie, like Will Smith's I am Legend, but for the hero itself to be CGI...no. Too much. Might be because the movie's attempt for a plot/Greek tragedy/whatever is incompatible with an enraged main character that ultimately just mindlessly bashes things. Might be because half of the time I don't know what's going on or why.All I remember is I wasted a good hour watching this crap. Twice.",Hulk
256,TheUnseenMovieLover,An Entertaining and Refreshingly Ambitious Movie,8,8 May 2008,"I must admit that I was surprised when I went to watch Hulk in summer 2003. This was something totally different to what had been promised in the trailers. What looks like an intelligent, action-packed blockbuster had become an intelligent, psychological human drama. Now I wasn't at all upset by the fact that there were serious, thought-provoking themes in the storyline, which was refreshing for a superhero film. What did annoy me was that they took too long to fully develop. Now, when I watch the movie, I still have a nagging desire to look at my watch during the first hour. This, in my opinion, is never a good thing whilst watching a movie.The upcoming Incredible Hulk looks like it has hit the right note, which is striking a good balance between action and story. I'm not having a go at films which place story above action, but other films like Hulk give you some sort of reassurance that spectacular things are on the way, and this gives you the confidence to stick around long enough to be amazed. In Hulk, it takes too long for reassurance to appear in the form of the big green guy himself.Based on my ranting, you may think that I dislike Hulk. Far from it. From the moment that the Hulk first appeared on screen, the film had me hooked. I was thoroughly involved from that point onwards, due to the tense and exciting question of when the Hulk was next going to explode onto the screen. The action sequences are also impressively crafted, mixing artistry and dramatic weight together with good effect.The acting is flawless. All of the actors handle their roles with aplomb. As Bruce Banner, the unfortunate individual who turns green every time he gets angry, Eric Bana is a revelation, clawing into the character and emerging with surprising emotional depth and focus. Jennifer Connelly lends passion and intelligence to the role of Betty Ross, the love interest, which is the role that is most prone to being overlooked in comic book movies, whereas Sam Elliott brings complexity and gruff spirit to his performance as Betty's military father. As Banner's unhinged father, Nick Nolte very nearly steals the film, bringing a refreshing realism and crazed menace to the too often over-played role of the mad scientist. Nolte's portrayal is quivering with dramatic intensity, and I can never take my eyes off him whilst watching the film. The final link in the main cast is Josh Lucas as sleazy executive Glenn Talbot, who is set against Bruce. Lucas doesn't do anything revolutionary with the role, but he does what he has to do, which is to make the audience thoroughly despise him.Visually, Hulk is impressive, if not perfect. The Hulk himself is well-created, and the visual effects used to create him are effective enough. There are also some good visual effects used to create the Hulk's final opponent. However, some visual effects (the Hulk bouncing across the desert like a bouncy ball etc) seem to be defying the logic of the title character whenever the director, Ang Lee, finds it necessary. This seriously distracts the viewer, and comes very close to derailing their belief that what they are seeing is real.Apart from the aforementioned visual problems, the action sequences in Hulk are well-crafted. The action highlight is a grand-slam battle in the desert between the Hulk and the military forces headed up by General Ross. This sequence is lengthy, gripping and terrifically artistic. The other action sequences vary from the good (a fight between the Hulk and a trio of mutated dogs is darkly funny and intense) to the disappointing (the climactic smash-up is confusing and keeps the audience at an arm's length).Ang Lee directs with terrific visual style and intelligence. His direction does seem to point to the fact that he wasn't aware that the first forty minutes or so drag, as well as the fact that he thought that there wasn't a problem changing the laws of gravity to make the Hulk as bouncy as a little kid after eating sweets. But he does show energy in his crafting of the film and its action sequences, and he is obviously trying to make the film as open to different audiences as possible. However, there are moments when you question whether Lee was the right man for the job. The script also tries to pack in as much intelligence as possible, and mostly succeeds, despite often seeming too pretentious and pandering.The scoring for the movie is brilliant. Danny Elfman flawlessly creates a sense of tense atmosphere which suits the film beautifully. Also, the editing is delightfully inventive, constructing the majority of scenes as if they were pages ripped from a comic book.Overall, Hulk is an inventive, ambitious and entertaining movie. It may not be entirely successful, but it is nice to see a comic book film which takes a step outside the safety zone. Ang Lee, the crew and the cast took a risk with this production, and whilst Hulk is far from the best comic book film ever made, it is still an intriguing and intelligent experience. I'm not looking forward to The Incredible Hulk because I enjoyed this film version. Both movies are different entities, and they should be respected as such.",Hulk
257,JasonLeeSmith,Very Bad Movie,3,24 November 2009,"The Hulk is one of my favorite comic book characters, and I have always felt that Ang Lee is an excellent director. Despite these two prejudices, I felt that ""The Hulk"" was a terrible, dull, nonsensical movie.I thought that all the principles (except possibly for Nolte) were stiff and wooden in their acting. The movie endeavored to have a quiet, and a brooding atmosphere, but, instead, was just really dull. The lead up to his transformation into the Hulk was slow and dreary. I'm probably one of the few who wasn't really bothered by the CGI (which many thought was substandard), but I never got much of a sense of empathy for the monster.Then, at the end, there is a confrontation between Banner/Hulk and his nemesis, which just plain does not make any logical sense.I imagine that they were trying to make this film into a super-hero/psychological horror film, but it just didn't work. It was too slow, and the scenes which were meant to draw out suspense just made things more dull.",Hulk
258,obiwan2005,'Hulk' too big for his purple daisy dukes,9,15 July 2003,"I had the pleasure of seeing 'Hulk' in San Francisco, the city in which the film takes place. Now, many people thought the movie is slow, which it is, and boring, which it's not, and ultimately too brainy for average movie viewers to comprehend. The plot revolves around Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) who's character in this movie seems to go undefined, and his on/off gal pal Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). In a freak lab accident (or so it seems), Banner is pelted with radioactive gamma rays that, when triggered by anger, transforms Banner into a giant green behemoth. The plot then unravels to show the involvement of Bruce's estranged father David (Nick Nolte). Also, Betty's father, General 'Thunderbolt' Ross (Sam Elliot) and Major Talbot (the sleek Josh Lucas), trying to find and contain Banner's destructive alter ego in hopes to replicate the formula to breed an army of Hulk-Soldiers to fight for Uncle Sam. I can't tell you much more then that without spoiling the rest of the movie. But, unlike the comic, this movie does not dwell on the exploits of the Hulk, but rather Banner's destructive and haunted past. And mostly on how the genesis of his power began. This movie is overly long at about 2 and a half hours, but the movie has merit as a movie unto it self. Bana's and especially Nolte's performances were extraordinary. Most notably in one of their final confrontations toward the end of the film. The Hulk looks very good, the CGI was wonderful. And the way the that director Ang Lee uses multi-angle sequences to pay homage to the multi-panel look of comic books was very refreshing. But in the quest to deliver a 'Greek Tragedy' of sorts, he forgot his target audience. The action movie junkies. The kids who watch cartoons on Saturday morning. This movie is too grown up for them to understand, or care about. That being said, the movie would have suffered alot less if it hadn't tried to be a thinking man's film. Finishing on a lighter note, I loved the cameo appearance of 'Hulk' creator Stan Lee and 'Incredible Hulk' TV star Lou Ferrigno as Security Guards. One hopes they will make a spin off film or TV series of their exploitsRATING: *** out of ****",Hulk
259,tramsbottom,Misunderstood and very enjoyable,7,28 July 2003,"The general consensus seems to be 'it's too dull, nothing happens'.  And this is exactly what's wrong with movie audiences today.  They don't haven't the patience.  Because here Ang Lee has done something amazing with a comic book - he's made a piece of art on film.Granted, he takes things too seriously at times, and Banner never smiles, but for the most part the movie works.  For all the Hulk smash-smashy stuff to work you need to get to know the characters first and you'd be forgiven for thinking you were watching another character drama instead of a huge Hollywood comic book adaptation.  The studio wrongly sold the film as an all-out action fest, when really it has very little to do with FX and spectacle, although these are heavily present towards the end.So I suppose your enjoyment of Hulk depends on whether you want to see a movie with an open mind or you want to pick it apart for what it 'should have been' (fanboys I'm looking at you).  Oh and the editing is just amazing.",Hulk
260,CMUltra,Offbeat but fun!,7,5 July 2003,"*Slight Spoilers*I say offbeat because this is not the typical comic book fare we've been receiving.  I guess getting Ang Lee to direct will do that.  There were pros and cons.Overall?  No.  Lee's style is just too slow, too often.  Meditative pauses work fine with within the mythos of kung-fu but they seemed out of place here.Lee put his artistic flair to good uses too though.  I loved the way he moved frames in and out like comic book panels.   And whenever the action heated up, Lee made me gasp and cheer.  Well done!Bana was good as Bruce Banner.  I liked the feel he gave to the character, though I never really got the impression he was a ""geek"" scientist.Nolte over-acted the elder Banner character.  Yes, it's a comic book movie but you don't have to bring the same melodrama.  Bana and the others portrayed their characters a bit more seriously.Connelly was fine as well.  The Betty Ross character wasn't given a lot of room to develop so it's hard to say with her.Elliot gave my favorite performance of the humans in the movie.  His character was the one that had me most remembering General Ross from the comics.  Right on target!And, of course, the Hulk.  Great CGI rendition!  I went in wishing they had used a live actor with CGI enhancements.  Now I see they made the right decision.  This pure CGI Hulk was *everything* the comic book Hulk should have been.  Kudos to having Ferrigno appear in a cameo though!The ending was... not well done.  The battle between the Banners seemed out of place.  Plus, the CGI battle was way too dark.  You were sitting there squinting.  Why??  Darkness can be used to hide special fx flaws with live actors but this was all CGI.  Plus the elder Bana's transformation seemed to be The Absorbing Man from the comics.  If it was, they completely tossed out the comic book origins.  Overall the ending was just annoying.  Which was too bad, as the rest of the movie really succeeded on several levels.I do recommend this movie!  The pacing could have been better and the ending really needed to be handled differently.  The action sequences, character development and CGI elements were all great though.6.5 out of 10.",Hulk

Ok film because science fiction and comics go good but this director Ang Lee does not really get it.More action towards the end. 5 stars not in Spidermans league.

There were some parts that I truly enjoyed and thought were well constructed, but when you compare it to the recent reboot, it is nothing but a bucket of rabbit feces.Overall, the film is alright, but comes out a little bland. If you want a good Hulk movie that is true to the comics and the television series from the 70s, go with the Incredible Hulk from 2008, because this film is just as stale as an open box of Froot Loops.",Hulk

I didn't know much about the Hulk but I enjoyed quite much.  Now I will say though it's not as good as the other marvel movies that have come out like X-Men, X2, Spider-man, & Daredevil but still good.  Though it does seem to take a while to actually see the Hulk it's still worth seeing.  The effects in the movie are great.  All the scenes that involve Hulk are basically with him destroying something but the action is just so cool.  Now I see why people dis the movie and I am not one but if you here bad things about it just ignore it and see it, it is worth seeing.  you never know you might even enjoy it.",Hulk

Even the Fantastic Four has been better, and I consider this an insult.Eric Bana is miscast, to say at the least, and the rest of the crew is forgettable. The effects are not bad (they managed to get Hulk green and big, wow), but nothing you will tell your grandchildren stories of. I don't think Ang Lee got the point of the Hulk-story.I can't wait for the Edward Norton version. I can't say however that they shall have a great predecessor to overshadow.If you have not watched this movie yet, don't. Wait for the new one. There is nothing you would miss.",Hulk

Not that non-stop action is all that I care about. But when I saw this movie that was really what I was looking for. I didn't expect to have to wait until 30 minutes into the movie to see Hulk's transformation. When he finally appeared he wasn't a big or as super great or w/e as I though he would be. You would think that with cgi crap around that you would be able to make this Hulk super. I only give this movie a 5 because I did find it to be somewhat entertaining. My friend Mike however found it to be awesome. Now I walked out thought it was good.But I didn't think it was awesome or great. And when I look back on the movie, I feel even more disappointed. Now again I gave it a 5 because some of it was entertaining. If it wasn't for the fight scenes at the end and the part where he killed the dogs, I might not have like it at all.

The CGI is ghastly and looks so horrendous it's laughable. I understand that technology was not as advanced as it is now, but come on! Look at the Hulk jumping around in the desert. He looks so goofy running around and jumping. And let's talk about the editing please. The editing is JARRING. We didn't need the part with him as a kid, we could have gotten to that later. All of that was completely unnecessary. The way some people appear in little boxes that SLIDE FOR SOME REASON while another box appears for another character. My god, it looks so tacky and terrible. I would definitely say watch this for laughs. But on the other hand it's soooo boring! Nothing happens the whole movie.This was 2003 and we did not know how to make superhero movies.

Even if the Hulk looked 99% real, he still would have not seemed real - because you know he's not real.  Get my drift?  Hulk is one of more realistic comic book adaptations because of its emotion and taking time to develop the character(s).  Ang Lee does a masterful job of executing a flawed and limited script with excellent direction of the two young stars.  Bana and Connely give real depth to Banner and Betty - you really care what is going to happen to them, their relationship.  But overall, this movie is about the relationship between parent and child.  It delves deep into the interworkings of very complicated child/parent relationship.  Even the Hulk touches his inner human (if you will) in a flashback of a repressed childhood memory.  The movie has depth and heart. Ang Lee should be commended for not directing the typical comic book movie. Even if you don't want the emotional side, Hulk delivers in its final hour with a slam bang wrap up.

My point is only, that this movie is intelligent and goes deep in emotions and to the origins of the characters, specially the misunderstood heroe Hulk. Most of the action we had already seen in the trailers on TV, the important thing is the drama treatment, the action just completes the excellent film. If you just want to enter the theater and see action, and you dont want to use your brain at all, then go see another movie. If you want an excellent film, with action and a superb story, then go see the Hulk. Just a masterful adaptation!!",Hulk

This movie shows that a great story can be told, and that can surprise, and be reinvented even if we already know what it is about. THe direction by Ang Lee, rapports a lot of deep very emotive feelings. Using the cinematographic language, he makes the audience feel connected somehow to the stream of emotions, that vary, from love, anguish, anger, pain, desire, that the characters live through the story. Excellent movie. The only thing that I didnt like from studios nowadays is that somehow they are showing audiences a lot of scenes from films, in the trailers on TV, and that spoils a little bit the surprise of warching the special FX first time when going to the theater. Specially in high budget films, like Matrix, and Hulk etc.., please studios a trailer is just a sneak peek, dont spoil the fun. I watched involuntarily so many times the special FX from the Matrix reloaded on TV, that they even bored me when I went to see the film, the studios are maybe so desperate to attract audiences that they ruin the whole movie expirience.",Hulk
272,vamp88,not a total waste of time,4,21 June 2003,"Looking for a great fun summer block buster? Keep looking. We all saw the previews with the sub-par CGI effects, and to be fair my friends and I agree the effects played better then expected. Eric Bana did a fine job as mild mannered Bruce Banner, and Jennifer Connelly was exceptional as the beauty Betty Ross. That was what was good about the movie. However much of the movie didn't work. At times the CGI effects still looked like a video game (once again I'll say they looked much better then on the trailer). The movie ran way too long. Especially for a movie that has a younger target audience. I enjoyed the story leading up to our first Hulk sighting, but it was too long and dark for younger audiences. Right off the bat during the opening credits there are certain images that could be disturbing for the youngest viewers. Now, even thought it is too long and too slow the worst part was the climactic battle between Bruce and David. I still couldn't follow exactly what happened or how? My friends and I started to try to figure it out and decided we didn't care enough to put the energy into trying. The explanation just didn't make enough sense to satisfy us. Being a comic fan from childhood and a casual fan today I have enjoyed seeing Marvel characters make it to the big screen, but they should make sure the movies being made are good (X-men, Spider man), not mediocre (Daredevil, Hulk), or they will soon see their audience and hype for these movies decline sharply.

273,Rirath_com,Just like the Bad Old Days,1,23 June 2003,"Remember not so long ago, when almost every comic book turned movie was cringed at? The only people who would dare see them without plenty of reassurance would be the die hard comic fans, who would love the movie no matter what? Well sadly, The Hulk is a big step backward from recent releases and takes the genre back to those very days.The acting and story are extremely over the top. What's worse is all seems like it's in the wrong dang movie. If a very few select scenes were removed, you'd be hard pressed to even call this sci-fi much less The Hulk. It's yet another pseudo-intellectual flick trying to be more than it is and failing miserably. I'm so sick of movies using cheesy editing and over the top acting and dialog to beg the audience to believe it's saying something intelligent. Intelligence doesn't require gimmicks.Hulk is by far too nice and friendly to be the Hulk. In one scene, he's peacefully sitting in the desert looking at flowers. No rage, no anger, nothing. Yet, he's still Hulk. The only good CGI scene in this entire flick is a helicopter battle in the desert. Sadly, even that's pretty much ruined by constant cries of ""I'm okay!!"" over the radio so our Hulk stays a good boy.This entire movie is cliché rips from anything and everything, but barely including the comic in that list. The stereotypical General, the genius criminal without access to a comb in his life, the vanilla hero, even the nosy won't shut the heck up girlfriend. If this obsessive daddy's girl could mind her own freaking business for a half a millisecond, maybe Hulk boy wouldn't be so stressed!Rirath_com",Hulk
274,TheFilmConnoisseur,The Nick Nolte Show,9,23 June 2003,"****Excellent***Good**Fair*Poor
Director Ang Lee successfully makes this a comic book movie but not a movie! With the exception of Spider-Man what has bothered me a bit about these Marvel films is that they don't feel like a movie. A comic book like a television show and book series keeps it's audience anticipating each new chapter or episode to see what's the latest or the conclusion in the adventure of it's hero. Comic books work the same way but a film however only has two hours to capture the imagination of the audience and keep them thrilled and excited. A film is like a rollercoaster ride. It's quick but exciting. Where Tim Burton's Batman, Richard Donner's Superman, and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man succeeded is in taking you to this fantasy world full of adventure and imagination and strapping you for the ride. With fascinating scenes, over the top characters, and unforgettable moments.
Ang Lee does a great job of exploring the world of the Hulk and he creates moments of beauty and rage but never magic. There's never a fascinating moment in the Hulk where like Batman, Superman, and Spider-Man you feel like you're in another world with larger then life characters. This film like a comic book keeps you anticipated for the next installment but doesn't fully allow you to enjoy it's world. And another flaw the film has is the CGI Hulk which looks as bad as the Scooby-Doo CGI. Perhaps that could also affect the film. What I enjoyed the most about the Hulk is the performances. Eric Bana or Banana like the kids call him these days does a magnificent job as Bruce Banner and his chemistry with the beautiful Jennifer Connelly is magical. However, the BEST part of this film is Nick Noltes performance. He practically steals the show from the Hulk and makes it his own. He gives a great Oscar performance.RATING: 3 STARSNow while the Hulk was a good movie it could have been better.",Hulk

277,Norway1,"Beautiful, intelligent, dark, exciting: Ang Lee's HULK",6,11 July 2003,"I honestly don't know what people are complaining about. The CGI was absolutely top-notch! Absolutely as good as (if not better than) Gollum from LOTR.Hulk was real. Alive. A character of flesh and bones that you could touch. At least seemingly so.Hulk interacted with his surroundings more than any other CGI character I've ever seen - yes, including Gollum.And the CGI was not even the best part of this film. It was the story.Ang Lee is a brilliant and bold director. This was absolutely his film. There were many times through the movie when I thought to myself: ""This is the Director's cut!"" I was amazed that studio executives didn't cut it up to make it into a shorter, tighter ""summer action flick"". Of course, that is exactly what many people were expecting, which perhaps explains it's mixed reviews.The first hour of HULK was building and developing the characters. All of them. From Betty Ross (the beautiful and talented Jennifer Connelly - who absolutely steals the show here with her acting)  to David Banner (Bruce Banners' sanity-absent father, a solid and convincing performance by Nick Nolte) to Ross' Military Dad (played brilliantly by Sam Elliott) to Bruce himself (Eric Bana was perfect. PERFECT!).I could really go on and on about how much I liked this movie, but I never like to read long reviews, so I'll try to keep this one short too.Trust me: If you liked the style of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, and you can appreciate a serious and somewhat dark Sci-Fi movie, this one's for you!Just keep in mind that this is NOT a kid's movie (like Star Wars or Spiderman) and that the action is only secondary to the story.My rating: 9 out of 10",Hulk
278,HulkVader,Very well done,10,28 June 2003,"Though not pertinent to compare, but The Hulk is the best of the comic book adaptations. And that's saying something because both X-Men movies and Spider-Man were each very good in their own right (I've not seen Daredevil, to this point). The storyline for The Hulk, obviously, was altered. Modernized, if you will, and very well, at that. The acting was good, also. This is a film, greatly, about a madman; a scientist gone insane and the effects his work, in his younger days, has had on his son as it has come to fruition (with the aid of some good old radiation) some twenty-five years later. The rest you will have to discover on your own. It will not be time ill spent. This is a quality movie, well beyond the ""comic book"" label. 9/10. Cheers.",Hulk

The film is pure and has moments of utter destruction and power by the Hulk, great beauty, and style. This masterpiece by Ang Lee has it all in my opinion, a haunting musical score, moments of awesome action (especially the dog fight, and the tank and helicopter battle scenes in the desert).   The isolation of the desert army base really suits the mood of the film, and is true to the original comic book. The moments where the hulk jumps and soars over the desert terrain are magical! The 'picture in picture' techniques used by Lee are also superb and echo the Hulk's print origins. Not to be overlooked is the acting. All the performances are also INCREDIBLE. Eric Bana is good as Bruce Banner, Nick Nolte is really great as his mad scientist father, Jennifer Connelly is so convincing (and beautiful!!) as Betty Ross, and the best performance is by Sam Elliott, who is tailor made to play the Betty's tough father, General Ross. He is great beyond words in this film!   Watch 'Hulk' and prepare to be amazed, it is a masterpiece of the super-hero film genre. Spiderman was a good popcorn movie, 'Hulk' is much more!",Hulk

281,mjensen-3,"""One of The Best Superhero films of the 20th century""",7,12 August 2004,"Bruce Banner(Eric Banner, Troy) is one of the best actors in the business, he shows not only anger in ""The Hulk"", but sadness and kindness. Thats what I want to see, I was getting tired of mindless action in ""Matrix Reloaded"", so I saw this film and I get character development and actual acting. Nick Nolte trancended acting in the 70's and he's not at his best in this film, but he was good enough for me to dislike his character in this film. Jennifer Connelly who won an academy award for playing the same exact role in ""A Beautiful Mind"", and she's not all that great in this film, in fact she's down right annoying, but we need that kind of vulnerability in this kind of movie. This film doesn't need dialogue like ""Spider-Man"", or ""Superman"", or even ""Batman"", it puts us in a mood that is a little depressing, and silent, like when Bruce describes what he feels when he becomes the Hulk, there's a moment of silence and no music, just the sound of his voice. ""Boom, Boom"", Thats what he says when he describes what he feels. Ang Lee is way ahead of his time, when Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" came out, people described the action and the fighting instead of the actual story, cause it's to painful to describe.  One of the main, characters die in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", and Bruce Banners spirit dies, but Ang Lee keeps that depressing mood in his films, and shows the Hulk in a different way. He actualy shows him the right way, a person, not none of this Hulk smash stuff, just a person, like me and you, and other people full of anger and a bad past.This is a great film, I give it ***1/2(out of four stars).",Hulk

283,evilasahobby,A standout comic-character film,8,3 July 2003,"You will either love or hate ""Hulk"". If you haven't already worked this out by the difference in opinions left by other posters on this board, keep it in the front of your mind when watching this movie.""Hulk"" is a very different comic book film. It stands out in the field by making the ""Hulk"" a decidedly non-heroic character. Bruce Banner (underplayed by Eric Bana - decide for yourself if he is playing a repressed character or just can't act; I think the former) certainly isn't someone you'd envy. He has just broken up with his girlfriend (Betty Ross played by Jennifer Connolly who actually makes a believable scientist) but still has to work with her. His experiments aren't going well. A potential suitor for both Betty and Banner's research is lurking around the laboratories (Talbot - an obvious bad guy as portrayed by Josh Lucas). Someone claiming to be his father appears, claiming Bruce's life to be a lie as he knows it. On top of this Banner continues to have nightmares that have plagued him all his life. Bruce is under pressure.As expected, an accident in the lab causes Bruce Banner to be bombarded by gamma radiation which in turn leads to his transformation into the Hulk. The best scenes in this movie involve the Hulk. For all the lashing out the Hulk does at whatever is striking him, this film does a fantastic job of showing that all Hulk / Banner really wants is some peace. It is in these touches of soul that ""Hulk"" shows itself as an exceptional comic-book adaption.This isn't to say that ""Hulk"" isn't flawed - it has moments that run too long, while some of the dialogue just doesn't flow. It also isn't the action film that some fans expect with the climatic battle at the film's end being perhaps unnecessary. But these are small points if you can enjoy the rest of the film. If you don't enjoy the rest of film though... well, there are enough negative user comments on this board to tell you what to expect.Ang Lee has managed to direct another amazing film that looks at a genre in a unique way. The Hulk CGI will date, but works very well in the scenes environments and looks believable. Although ""Hulk"" won't be the blockbuster hit of the summer, it has cult written all over it and will talked about long after ""Daredevil"" and ""T3"" have become mere footnotes of 2003.",Hulk
284,RandomTask-AP,Not for everyone and a better movie for it (mild spoilers),8,31 July 2003,"Barriers of all kinds get broken in the latest Marvel Comics adaptation being sent to the big screen. Science, speed, strength are all shattered by driven doctors, military personnel and an oversized green man with a serious impulse control problem. It's the human elements that rule over special effects and are most memorable at the core of Ang lee's ""Hulk"". The story is one of serious proportions with told many beautiful moments but little humor. The truth of the matter is that Lee's film is not just a comic book, but an out and out horror film rooted in family tragedy.
Dr. David Banner (played in flashback by Paul Kersey and in the present by a dangerous Nick Nolte), the father of Bruce (Eric Bana), is pursuing a way to enhance human strength and immunity. The elder Dr. Banner self-experiments for the project in 1965 and alters his soon-to-be -conceived son, Bruce. This leads David into conflicts with both wife and boss, a military man named Ross. Ultimately young Bruce is traumatized and left to develop into the repressed adult scientist who unknowingly continues his father's work. Betty Ross (Jennifer Connolly) is a fellow scientist and ex-lover with the adult Bruce. Betty helps drive the science forward and is witness to the freak accident which exposes Bruce to the life-altering gamma radiation. Although Bruce (Eric Bana) feels newly reborn at first, he quickly discovers the price for his good health as he changes into the green-skinned title creature who is the physical manifestation of all those years of buried anger. General Ross (Sam Elliot), Betty's father, poses a double challenge to her as an emotionally distant parent and the hunter of her mutated boyfriend. Bruce's struggle to contain himself and the creature are secondary considerations to his long-lost father, General Ross and military contractor Glenn Talbot (Josh Lucas) who all see the Hulk as either a vessel of either destruction or potential power. Only Betty has any genuine concern for Bruce/Hulk's well being.Many people are expecting a simple comic offering for the popcorn summer blockbuster crowd, and they may find that the film is much darker than other superhero flicks like ""Superman"", ""Spider-Man"" and even the superpowers-as-racial-strife metaphors in ""X-Men"". When the Hulk is on screen, he is a thrill to watch, but the effect moments come slowly and are (in the reverse of most summer plots) slave to the story and not the other way around. The humor level is very low. The kids sitting next to this reviewer appeared bored a great deal of the time, and most adults jumped during a sequence with 3 mutant dogs attacking the main characters. One can only imagine the average kid having at least one nightmare about the deadly canines.Director Ang Lee has taken the comic book movie and deepened it into the world's (as several reviewers have dubbed it) first Hollywood-produced superhero art-house film. (Considering the film's dip at the box office during its early weeks, this will probably - and unfortunately - not sit well as precedent for the superhero art trend with studio executives.) Ultimately, the tragedy drives the story, and all the characters have their flaws. Bruce and Betty have a mildly dysfunctional relationship because of his emotional distance and her many emotional disappointments with men. General Ross is vicious in his pursuit to destroy the Hulk, but with the motivation to protect civilian populations. Even Bruce's father as the villain becomes limitedly sympathetic when his role in the tragedy that began the movie is fully revealed. However, he is still the villain here, and his final betrayal culminates (somewhat ambiguously) in a special effects spectacular.The Hulk is a convincing actor for a computer creation, and shame on the academy if the ILM crew does not receive several Oscar nominations. ILM's use of motion capture has allowed Ang Lee to directly and personally infuse his vision into the behemoth character, and Lee takes full advantage of it. The Hulk tosses tanks around, rides on the back of a fighter plane and erupts out from under the pavement of San Francisco's streets. `Old Greenskin' emotes not only rage and brute force, but also hope and curiosity with a full spectrum of expressions. This is a creation that accepts affection from Nick Nolte and turns to anguish and finally rage when Bruce's childhood memories resurface. The Hulk shows fear in the possibility of Betty's rejection the first time she sees him; wonder at his own reflection and genuine concern when motorists on the Golden Gate Bridge are put in the path of an out-of-control fighter jet.Another technical item worth mentioning is the innovative use of editing to emphasize the comic book experience. The use of multiple frames is obvious and in the hands of a lesser director could be an irritating distraction. Through thoughtful preparation, however, Lee uses it to create a unique feel, and the computer-generated frames gracefully carry action and dialogue within individual scenes as well as transitions from scene to scene. It is an item that will hopefully also receive due attention come Oscar time.Many people make the point that superhero movies are fly-by-night in the ever-lengthening history of film. Here is a comic book film with serious emotional substance and people are uncertain whether to call it a challenging achievement or entertainment that has overshot its audience. With all the merchandising from candy to value meals, one has to wonder if the studio executives really knew that they were paying for a great film and not just an amusement ride. This is not just a series of orchestrated explosions and set pieces, but a dark tale of families lost to the pursuit of power with the accompanying rage manifesting itself into a very tangible monster. Perhaps like the scientists of the movie, the message for moviegoers is to be careful what you wish for, because you just might get it.8.5 out of 10",Hulk

288,whizkids,Spoilers.,2,21 June 2004,"Spoiler! Spoiler!! SPOILER!!! This whole movie is a spoiler. It took thirty minutes (thirty looong minutes) before Bruce even got zapped with the gamma. Then it took another fifteen at least before he turned into the Hulk.
Other complaints include bad comic book effects. For over one third of the movie, I felt like I was watching a comic book off of the MARVEL website. (Here's where the ""real"" spoilers are) The things the Hulk fought were also dumb. First, it was giant mutant dogs that his father had created from Bruce's DNA. Personally, I think they were just trying to cash in on the Lord of the Ring's Two Towers Wargs. Next, they had Bruce trying to break out of a government location getting away from what I see as a jealous man who likes Bruce's girl. When he gets picked off from his own bomb, I think that's the worst effect in the whole movie by turning him into a piece of cardboard surrounded by flames. Then we have the Hulk hopping from place to place trying to get away from his girlfriend's father, who's trying to lock him up with missiles. Then, finally, we have him fighting his dad, which contains some of the worst action scenes I have ever seen. We could see V'ger from the Star Trek movie better than we could see ""Daddy dearest"". First he was an electricity monster, and I could see how he turned into that. Next, he turned into a rock monster, which I don't see how that could have happened. Next, he turned into this water...thing. Oh, and while Hulk was in the water, I couldn't make heads or tails what was going on. Why, oh, why did they have to set it up for a sequel? I beg you, please don't!!In short, it's not an action movie, nor is it a good drama. It's more like a really, really bad soap opera with monsters in it. The only reason I could see a person wanting this movie, is if they're a comic book artist, and they need the muscle tones from the Hulk. Other then that, stay away.",Hulk
289,bujinbudoka,The Worst Comic Book Movie.....almost.....,6,19 April 2006,"As a fan of the Marvel and DC comic books growing up, I have to say it was with no small measure of happiness when I heard they were going to make and release a big-budget Incredible Hulk movie. I have to say I was disappointed in the biggest way possible.I was (and still am) a fan of the original Hulk TV show with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno both playing the dual roles of Bruce Banner and The Hulk. However, even though I felt Eric Bana did a decent job as the tormented Doctor Banner in this movie, I felt that the movie was very lacking. One, the Hulk looked like a cross between Shrek and the Jolly Green Giant. Two, the aggravating ""fade-in to other scenery shots"" you see throughout the movie. Three, the scenes where they try to make it like a comic book. And finally, instead of a villain from the comics, like The Leader, or The Abomination, heck even Doc Sampson, who, while not a bad guy, would've made for a cool fight in the movie, they let his dad become The Absorbing Man. A villain from the Thor comics.Sure, they got the story somewhat right, and in terms of bringing it to the screen, they did OK. But to me there are, and always will be, superior comic-book movies. If you're a Hulk fan, this movie will disappoint. Trust me. However, if you really aren't into comics, or are just kind of playing at the edges, then you should really like it.I give it a 6 out of 10.",Hulk
290,richard-mason,"Ang Lee, Stan Lee, No Relation",5,19 July 2003,"Well, it had to happen. Ang Lee has finally made a bad film. The genius of The Wedding Banquet, Eat,Drink,Man,Woman and Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon has found a genre he just doesn't get.I've never been a fan of the (Incredible) Hulk, but since Ang Lee directed the film, and Aussie boy making good Eric Bana was playing the lead (well, the part of the lead played by a human), I went along.Oh, dear.It started well. The credits sequence was quite dazzling in the way it conveyed so much information, in such a clever way, without a word of dialogue.As the film proper got underway, I liked all the clever split-screen, comic book edits. Reminded me of those pop art films of the 60s.But after a while, I realised why they were there. They were to disguise how BORING the film actually was. If it weren't for the flashy cuts, dissolves, split screens, there would be NOTHING to hold your attention.The big mistake was to treat the Pulpy Hulk like he was Greek tragedy, rather than Marvel Comic. Such a silly super hero premise does not stand up to Serious Acting and Portentous Writing. Leave that for The Ice Storm. A comic book adaptation should be fun.So we wait for about an hour before the Hulk finally appears, and then he's not too convincingly animated. More like a video game character than a big screen (anti) hero.Eric Bana struggles in the role of Bruce Banner. Jennifer Connelly fares better as the heroine. Nick Nolte is .... well, more like a Marvel villain at least.I don't know who the film is aimed at .... it's much too violent and scary for kids, too boring for teens and twenties, and too juvenile for older adults.But I'll still look forward to Ang Lee's next film with anticipation.

Hulk has to be the WORST superhero comic book movie I have ever seen! The special effects stank, the music didn't fit well with the movie at all, the acting was just flat out awful! I loved the Hulk television series, totally awesome! The movie was sickening! Christopher Reeve who was Clark Kent and Superman back in the 70's and 80's easily kicks Eric Bana's Butt, the guy who played Bruce Banner. He is an awful actor, same with Superman Returns' Brandon Routh, who happens to not bare any resemblance, IN ANY WAY TO CHRISTOPHER REEVE! Smallville's Tom Welling is Chris' successor, and a very close friend of Chris before he (Chris) died in 2004. Don't see Hulk, watch the original television series, see the Spider-Man films (that is a must), X-Men, Batman, Fantastic Four, Christopher Reeve's Superman films, and completely skip Superman Returns!

This time the director Ang Lee takes the tragic odyssey of Bruce Banner (Eric Banna, simply incredible acting) a scientist who begins his own war when an accident reveals a dark forgotten past creating a powerful and angry creature who lives by the deep feelings of Banner. More than a big budget action movie with a great cast, Hulk it's a symbolic tragedy. Maybe the only thing weak is the soundtrack of Danny Elfman, who has nothing really new or special for a film so good.",Hulk
293,LG72387,"'Hulk' is fine, but his life story is unnecessary",6,3 July 2003,"From the imagination of director Ang Lee comes a vision of epic proportions. However, that vision is unnecessary when talking about a film like The Hulk. His vision is to illustrate vividly why Bruce Banner is who he becomes and how the curse of turning into a 15 ft monster haunts him evermore. Ang Lee is able to do this rather successfully in The Hulk. However, in this type of film, audiences are looking to see more of The Hulk and want less of what appears on screen in this film. Audiences crave for less dialogue and more action which was the main problem with this film. When The Hulk appeared on screen, the film became a visual spectacle of magnificence and beauty. However, the film takes too much time to explain Banner's relationship with his father (elegantly portrayed by Nick Nolte) and how his actions lead Bruce into a world of fear and misfortune. Jennifer Connelly is fine as Banner's girlfriend Betty and Eric Bana is fine as Banner himself and does a great job at illustrating the fear within him. And whoever tells you that the Hulk looks fake and is portrayed as a Shrek on steroids, don't trust them. The Hulk looks amazing and much better than the one portrayed by Lou Ferrigno (plays a security guard in this film) in the 70's TV Show. Even when The Hulk is on screen, you can't see him because the scene is set in the dark. Ang Lee's vision is appreciated for this film. However, since it is a summer blockbuster, it is totally unnecessary because of the basic concept that WE WANT MORE HULK!",Hulk
294,BSchin2188,"Not bad, but not great either",3,21 June 2003,"Why, oh lord why, did Ang Lee get to direct this?  Even Wes Craven would have been better.  If Ang Lee had spent more money on CGI instead of all those stupid, creative camera cuts, then maybe the Hulk would have looked halfway real.  Better yet, get a real actor to play the Hulk.  I know that the Hulk is supposed to be as big as a house, but camera tricks and blue screen effects could have taken care of that.Computer animation was a real detriment to the movie.  The Hulk looked like a cartoon, and the dogs were even worse (although the fight scene where he beats the dogs down was really cool).  If you wanted a computer animated Hulk, why not just make this an entirely computer animated movie?  At least then everything around the Hulk would have looked equally crappy.Since when was the Absorbing Man Bruce Banner's father?  I don't mind if they don't follow the comic books, but Crusher Creel was the Absorbing Man, and that made more sense.  At least then they could have a cool enemy for any Hulk sequels.  I pray every hour that they never use the Leader bad guy. Just think of how terrible his CGI would look.Aside from god-awful direction and lousy special effects, the movie has a good plot, good action scenes and really good acting.  I'd really like to give this movie a grade of B+ for all the good parts, but they simply weren't enough to make up for the terrible camera cuts.  So this gets a B- instead.  For the sequel, get a real director.",Hulk

The long (60-minute) introduction into how Bruce becomes the Hulk. The fact that we get no real action until half way into the movie. The fact that the acting was horrible, the directing was equally as horrible, the script was putrid and the actors were miscast.About the only thing of any worth in this movie was the SFX. Besides that I hated this film. What a shame. They had a great story in the Hulk. Where X-Men and Spiderman thrive this movie flounders. I could not wait for it to end and thought to myself that you would have to be a complete idiot to make Hulk - The Sequel.

296,dacifu,kind of boring,4,3 April 2011,I remember watching this movie and for the longest time I tried to figured out what Ang Lee was trying to do. the whole story is so far from the original Hulk origin and the whole psychological spin to it is just plain stupid and unnecessary. the effects were good...OK good not that great. I though that the Hulk was a little over size in some scenes and way smaller in others. for example when he exited the underground facility he was unbelievable big. yet the pants stretched out from size 34 yo size 510. then when he was with Betty Hulk was way smaller. didn't like that inconsistency. the direction was good and the fight scenes were pretty decent but the whole father story was a complete headache. unnecessary and stupid. that's all. not a good movie,Hulk
297,yoncenator,see it before someone ruins it for you,10,23 June 2003,"I'm a big fan of Jen Connelly.  I saw the commercials and said, ""oh no, a CG Hulk movie?""  Spiderman was ok, Willem daFoe and Sam Raimi was a good combination but definately a kids movie.  This movie really captures a feel of modern comics, yet wasn't written for 12 year olds.  Ang Lee knows when he's got something good too.  Can't go wrong w/ the longest and closest camera shots of Jen ever.  I do admit the cg jumping got to me a little but that was the only problem I had.  Now I realize that cg Hulk was the way to go, growing to about 15 feet instead of the Lou Ferrigno size.  This is the only comic story that I'm actually looking forward to a sequel.It's intelligent with barely any holes, and has enough intricacy to make you want to see it again to catch all of the little things that are chocked into this 2hr18min movie.",Hulk
298,deadmanjones,You're all wrong and I;m right,10,2 September 2006,"I haven't seen a single positive review for this film, and I know the reason. The reason is that everyone who has seen it is a cretin except me.This is the first film to fully capture (or even to attempt to capture) the passion, artistry and narrative structure of the comic book art form. It succeeds because director Ang Lee cinematically translates the process of reading a comic; at instances where the reader would pause to take in the artistry and emotion of the scene, he slows the film down and repeats the same images for us; where a comic book would show different view points within the same frame, he does likewise. And where adrenaline pumped action is the order of the day, Ang Lee gleefully seems to skip through some images as a reader would quickly scan a page to see if the hero wins through. Towards the end he does break free from the comic book, but only to provide Nolte an opportunity to revel in theatre soliloquy.Every performance in this film is superb - including the CGI ones. Sam Elliot relishes the opportunity to do more than smile under his moustache for once.Ignore the reviewers who reviewed this film expecting Spiderman or X-Men. With every one of his recent films Ang Lee looks at the fantastic movies that proceeded him in that genre and then asks - what were they ACTUALLY trying to do, and how can I achieve what they wanted to do but didn't. Sense and Sensibility for the Period Drama, Ride with the Devil for the western... Hulk for the comic book movie.",Hulk
299,thepts,Surprisingly phat movie! (Note: Andromeda Strain link?),9,11 July 2003,"The weird, but interesting and elegant sceneshifts, the highly credible scientific details, the underground science labs - no, it doesn't have the exact, indescribably eerie mood of the Andromeda Strain - but the similarities are obvious.Anyway! I went to this, expecting a lightheaded action treat like ""Charlie's Angels"". In stead: The emotional trauma description, the portrayal of an unstable mind - and the mentioned scientific details; chemical centrifuges, petri dish shots, C code with if-statements and boolean sentences - Ang Lee has gone to the bottom of this film and does his very best to make the insane Hulk-universe credible.He has gone as far as he could to link the Hulk up to ""our"" reality, and it's good that he has gone to these lengths - because the Hulk himself is not that linked to reality. You remember CG-Gollum from Two Towers, one of the more credible (CG) characters ever seen in a movie? Well, not that kind of CG-character...Why? The design of CG-Hulk is without a doubt based on cartoon pages - but it doesn't work as it should. For the X-men's ""travel to the silver screen"", their cartoony look was replaced with something more high-tech, to fit into our time, and the movie format. Although I didn't like that with the X-Men, it might've helped The Hulk. Made him more humanly looking, given his anger a better, more credible look - or give him some sort of movie-adapted touch that didn't bring your thoughts towards computer generated graphics..But! The CG-scenes with the Hulk are the only weak parts of this movie - in my opinion. Anything that surrounds the Hulk, everything that happens around him - bear the fingerprints of a great director. I really love the Hulk's effect on his surroundings - heavy metal items smashing against stuff like toys. Yes, ""Hulk like smash things"" - but the scenes still maintain their artistic integrity.You can see that Ang Lee is a true filmmaker - he's not only a photographer who makes beautifully composed shots (and he does!), but he thinks in the fourth dimension - time. He makes beautifully composed movements. He uses forces, materials and consistencies against each other in an excellent way. He uses perspective shots which have an excellent movement flow to them.The fight-scene in the desert is genius.. using the consistency of sand to underline the forces at work and the Hulk's size! Really, really nice! Together with his experimental approach, this is a courageous movie. Ang Lee, great work!For everyone that can't see the beauty of this movie, or connect to the core of it: Try to look past the Hulk-character. If you can't, well, then I can understand you hated it. Look at the director's work. Absorb the moods. The Daredevil was, in relation, a parody, with a horrible story and hardly any credible characters. Spiderman was flat, predictable, and had the worst bad guy + costume ever seen in a movie. The Hulk thrones easily above these movies. In my opinion.8/10",Hulk

The amazing elastic and enduring nature of his underpants is perhaps more miraculous than the transformation itself.Can anyone tell me the brand of his underpants which one can probably wear the length of a life time? I want to buy them for my kids!Apart from this funny absurdity, the fatal wound of this movie is the CGI effects, which had fallen far below expectation.

303,Reef-Shark,Hulk (2003) - An ambitious and well done film,6,13 June 2008,"""Hulk"" 2003 is very different from what you would expect from a typical summer popcorn creature-feature. From the advertising campaign it appeared to be a mindless special effects extravaganza with little to no plot whatsoever; AKA Summer Fun. For those who went to see it with that mindset it was undoubtedly a not so pleasant surprise. Most of whom who saw this on its initial theatrical release obviously had not foreseen Ang Lee's philosophical drama, and they instantly retaliated causing Hulk to fail in most ways.I was surprised, but not in the way these common viewers were, because I loved Hulk. It is a superhero movie unlike any other comic based film in the last twenty-five years. This is a film that is filled with heart and emotion and delivers it fully in ways no other film of this genre has done before it. The art direction and special effects are astounding, and helps bring this comic character to life and oh so much more.The plot starts off rather simply with David Banner, a geneticist who has been studying regeneration, experimenting on various animals and finally ends up injecting himself. Eventually the mustached scientist has a son - Bruce Banner - who has apparently inherited his father's lab created gene.We now skip forward several years as Bruce begins studying exactly what his father had all those years before: regeneration. This only ends in what can only be described as disaster as an exposure of ""Gamma Rays"" causes his inherited gene to emerge transforming him into the not so jolly, green behemoth known as the Hulk. From there we are thrown into several well done action sequences as the military under the command of Gen. Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (a very human and well-crafted performance by Sam Elliot) begins an attempt to capture Bruce/Hulk to obtain this gene. Only complicating Bruce's hectic life is the reappearance of his crazed father who also cares more about the studies of his past opposed to his son's well-being which goes beyond abuse before finally leading up to an enormous CGI confrontation between mutated father and son.The Hulk does lack in the category of CGI at times with quality going up and down during a few cuts, and an adrenaline junkie will not enjoy the level of dialogue and drama that fills this plot that must have been a cinematic fusion between King Kong, Frankenstein and Marvel Comics. Ang Lee perfectly utilizes the split frame, thus turning this film into a living comic book and the entire cast does their part in moving the plot along. This isn't so much a superhero film as it is a doorway looking into the delicacy of humanity. You know and care about the characters, and you can certainly care about the man beneath the giant green muscled frame of the Hulk. That is what the movie is about, not a giant green man smashing things up for ninety minutes like so many 2003 movie goers were expecting.Sadly this film didn't hit the audience it should've due to Universal's careless advertising that passed this off as a popcorn film. If you're someone who likes emotionally compelling and ambitious tales Hulk (2003) may be the superhero film for you. If you liked Frankenstein or any of the King Kong adaptations Hulk will probably be a movie for you, just don't go in unprepared to think about the material you're viewing. This is one that one should defiantly pay attention to because it is probably the most underrated film of the 20th century.",Hulk
304,icfarm,"""You're gonna have to watch that temper of yours . . . . . """,8,16 August 2007,"I quite enjoyed this sci-fi effort from Ang Li, possibly because I wasn't necessarily looking for a re-production of the Bixby/Ferrigno TV series, or for two solid hours of ""Hulk-outs"".Dr. Bruce (I forget what his adopted family name is; sorry), played by Eric Bana, who, among other things, does a good job of shedding his natural Australian accent (and speaking Spanish at the end; more on that later), is participating in experiments involving good old gamma radiation that he hopes will give human beings the ability to heal themselves beyond normal human capacity; perhaps even be indestructible. One day, in the process of protecting a lab assistant from being hit by the aforementioned rays, he ends up being hit himself. This should have killed him, but instead, by his own description, he feels better than he ever has in his life. He is still required to spend some time in the hospital, however, and while in there, he is visited by a scraggly janitor who claims to be his biological father (Nick Nolte) and told that his real last name is - you guessed it - Banner.After being released from the hospital, Bruce BANNER begins having dreams - nightmares, really, - that are, at least in part, flashbacks to repressed early-childhood memories.Turns out, Mr. Scraggly Janitor IS in fact, Bruce's ""real"" father, and he has done prison time for continuing experiments - on himself - that he had been forbidden to perform. He has genetically altered himself, and passed this onto his son. This, combined with the exposure to gamma rays, results in the creation of . . . THE HULK! Bana gives, I think, a fine performance here. He is, I think, intentionally restrained and distant except for his pre-transformation moments. Then, his facial expressions are quite convincingly those of a man whose bottled-up rage is about to literally come bursting out. Jennifer Connelly, as his former love/current co-worker, also delivers as the only person who can bring him back to human form one he ""Hulks out"". The expressions on her face as she looks at him later in the film, both in Hulk and human form after transformation, are effective.I won't try to describe any more of the complicated plot twists. Watch and see for yourself. I will mention, however, the two tips of the hat to the TV show: A cameo by comic book icon Stan Lee and none other than Lou Ferrigno, who is still buff all this time after the series aired, and the ending, in which we find Bruce, who has survived a climactic battle (again, watch for yourself), and is now in some tropical, Spanish speaking locale trying to help the impoverished people with much needed medicine/medical care. When a group of guerrillas come along and try to confiscate everything, Bruce looks the lead Bad Guy in the eyes and warns, in Spanish, ""You're making me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry"". Then, after hearing the famous line, we see the famous first sign of the Hulk-out - eyes changing color, in this case green - before the camera pans up into the green trees and we hear the familiar roar. Enough to let us know that the Bad Guys are about to get their butts whooped by the Big Green Guy. A fine way to end the film, IMHO.Cheers.",Hulk

306,TonysLittleFriend,"""Hulk"" proves to be what may be one of the most interesting comic to film adaptations yet",7,14 October 2004,"***SPOILERS WARNING***The film opens in the late 1960s with a government scientist working on genetic engineering. The brass don't like him playing God and order him to stop, but he does not. At least he uses himself as the lab rat. Unfortunately, he did this before he had a son, named Bruce, who inherited his manufactured genes.Things go very awry and Bruce ends up orphaned and living with an adoptive family, taking the last name Krensler.He grows up to become a geneticist researcher in Berkeley, California, where he works in a lab with his ex-love interest Betty Ross whom he still gets along with in a friendly manner.Ross and Krensler have more than work and a near-romance in common, their fathers are both absent. In Betty's case, her military dad, a general was always more interested in work than her.But now they have another problem - the venal, smug entrepreneur Talbot who wants to take Banner's research on making the body self-healing to the military.Big money in that, after all. Talbot also has eyes for Betty, which does not sit well with Bruce. It all comes to a head when, during an experiment, Bruce nobly jumps in front of a blast of gamma radiation to protect an injured colleague from getting hit. Not only is he alive when he should have turned into bacon, but he's better than before. His injured knee is healing.It's at this point that a janitor shows up, claiming to be Bruce's father. For the rest of the movie we have the oedipal conflicts interspersed with Hulk battles. At least the fathers have a chance. The Hulk is impervious to pretty much anything. General Ross has this hell bent mission to destroy the Hulk as though it harmed his daughter, when in fact she's the only thing that can control him.At a time when so many movies are beyond completely and totally brainless, Hulk would seem to be exception. But no, instead we are treated to a film that seems to take it's self very seriously. True, Hulk himself does not appear in the film until 45 minutes into the movie. But those 45 minutes deal with most action movies tend to always ignore: Character development. It deals with, and never but, setting up the rest of the movie with a story and excellent character background.However, the film has many vaults. For example, I think they took far too many liberties with the comic books, like staying in Hulk form long after he should have calmed down and growing larger and larger as he gets more enraged. It's something that I found hard to ignore, seeing as how I am fan of this character, and many other Marvel characters, and I just hate seeing classic characters being mistreated.And also, the father issues I love. The reason why I love this movie is that it does have some what of a story, and doesn't try to fool the audience into thinking this movie is a joke. But it could have at least dropped some of the father plot line just to heighten the action and would probably be better for it. It could have cut down just a bit during the first hour and more people would most likely enjoy it.Personally, it makes me green... duh I mean mad that people rat on this film. People are always complaining that action movies are far too brainless and have no story. When we finally get one, Hulk, people complain that it's too much story induced. Wtf? I guess some people are morons and will never be pleased. It actually makes me mad quite a bit. The vaults that are subjected in the Hulk are many, but for the first time, actually make the film all the more interesting.This is the kind of film that anamorphic widescreen DVDs were created for as any attempt to pan and scan this thing will result in an unintelligible, visual mess. But like I said, in spite of its many faults, Hulk is one of the more interesting attempts at bringing a comic book character to film. One could even say that those faults make it a more interesting film, one that definitely deserves a look. ***/*****",Hulk

309,MadWatch,Hulk good. Hulk smash plot.,5,26 June 2003,"The main plot of the Hulk was a long, convoluted, multi-aspect mess. Genetic experiments, domestic violence, innocence, guilt, fear, remorse, regret, hatred, all wrapped up together into a big wad. The movie tried too hard and came up short.The numerous frames and angles tried to create a comic book look is great for comic books, but did not look good on the big screen. Too many 'goofy' scenes wipes and too many *long* scenes. I don't need to see 10 minutes of helicopters flying over the desert to understand that I am watching helicopters flying over the desert.Also, what was up with the Talbot character??!! This guy is so desperate to get the science research contract that he is portrayed as being a sadistic, uncaring person to a *ridiculous* degree. I mean, I understand this guy is greedy, but his maliciousness knows no bounds. He even goes so far as to pull weapons out of soldiers hands so that *he* can shoot at the Hulk AND he is physically confronting Bruce Banner while wearing 2-3 casts on various limbs AND a neck brace! I just thought that the writers went way over the top on this guy.However, the scenes with the Hulk were excellent! I would say that the movie was worth watching just for watching the scenes with the Hulk alone. The Hulk was portrayed excellently; his look, his manner, all right out of the comics. His jumping, fighting and the fact that he did not cause a single death in the whole movie, despite millions of dollars in property damage was a great portrayal.

His continuous screen-splitting is particularly distracting.The script for ""The Hulk"" is neither logical nor literate. The viewer tries to follow the plot for a while, but eventually gives up and starts making fun of the whole sordid mess. The ending is especially incomprehensible. The only halfway decent parts of the movie are the scenes with the Hulk in them (and there are far too few). Watching the big green guy smashing cars and busting up the streets of San Francisco provides us with a glimpse of what might have been, in the hands of more capable flimmakers. At least an hour of this far too lengthy film could have been cut with minimal effort, but there still wouldn't be enough good stuff left to make the thing watchable. Hopefully, everyone involved with ""The Hulk"" will take a good hard look before embarking on their next film project.",Hulk

The 2 main characters in the movie are far too boring and uninteresting. One does not care what has happened to the hulk, his girlfriend or anything that they are dealing with, The only one in the ensemble that's gets away with it is Nick Nolte as the Hulks father.
Another problem is that the movie is far too long, 137 minutes which makes the movie loooooong and booooring.All in all:  a boring, dull movie that maybe had worked out if it was one hour shorter and with other actors. But only maybe.",Hulk

313,miguelsanchez69,Brilliant Exploration of the Human Psyche and inventive filmmaking,9,28 June 2003,"First off, let it be said - this is NOT just an action movie. If you want a an incredibly inept slam-bang summer action thriller, you'll probably be disappointed, since aside from one or two outbursts, there's not tons of action until the last half hour or so. Purists might also want to note that the hulk's origins as well as some other things have been changed from the comic. I never really liked the Hulk comic much, though when I was younger I faithfully read no less than 10 marvel comics on a regular basis, and this wasn't one of them. However, Ang Lee does a brilliant job at turning the Hulk's rage into a wonderful metaphor. Beneath the veneer of a comic book film we have a metaphor for the psychology underlying our parental relationships in a consumer culture in the same sense Crouching Tiger was clearly a film about the political independence of a nation hiding amidst what was ostensibly a martial arts film. The film's Oedipal themes are incredibly intriguing, though ended in a somewhat unsatisfying way. The film's editing and Ang Lee's use of varying camera angles to depict the same creative geography in different ways violates anything I've ever seen in Hollywood editing and is wonderfully inventive. It resembles comic panels more closely than any other comic films. A very dark, intelligent, and deeply psychological film as well as brilliant cinema. It's too bad more mainstream films couldn't be this good. 99% of it will go over the heads of the audience watching it though.",Hulk
314,Bats_Breath,WARNING: Children will be Bored to Death with this Film,1,23 June 2003,"Whatever you do, don't take children to see this movie.  I took a bunch of 4th graders to see Hulk, and halfway through the film, they demanded to leave the theater.  They weren't the only kids that couldn't stand this film.  I saw many other kid walk outs.  Another class of kids was in the theater with us, and they actually left before we did.
So I am just warning everyone here, if you think Hulk is some kind of cartoon kiddie friendly movie, you are sorely wrong.  Children will be put to sleep with the Hulk.  This movie is VERY SLOW, and extremely dull and meandering.  The lumbering pace bored many adults, so I can understand why so many kids hated this movie.",Hulk
315,Winds_of_Destination,Too bland and dark,6,11 August 2007,"I'll admit, I like dark movies. They're very interesting to watch, as long as their is an emotionally driven backdrop. Hulk doesn't have this.It's pretty much 2 1/2 hours of anger, hate, fear, and freaky people who have no true feelings for anyone. Jennifer Connelly is the only emotional one, and she is so emotional it is very dark. The movie is really depressing; it barely even has daylight for Christ's sake! All the performances are bland and 1-dimensional, not giving human depth to really any character. My favorite character was Thunderbolt Ross because he borough more emotion than any other character, despite having a 2 1/2 dimensional character development.Eric Bana is a good actor but he is probably the worst of them all; nobody is bad but his role is so strange and freaky it's scary. Nick Nolte as David Banner is pretty much the same way but he is the baddie, and deserves to be that way. He is a very fun villain to watch on the screen and deserved more than one action sequence. I especially loved his scene where he shows up in Betty Ross' house and talks to her.The CGI and action sequences were impressive; dark, but all fun to watch. Each one was pieced together like beautifully disturving works of art, and is one of the things that kept the movie from getting boring.Overall, I wouldn't recommend Hulk really for anyone unless you're into the dark, 1-dimensional and nonsensical action films. Not something I'd watch often. 5.8/10.",Hulk

Before seeing it I heard so much hype sense the super bowl commercial. the movie had A major debut so when I saw I thought I was the only one that didn't really like it. There is a hulk villain that can absorb things but it is not his father who is named Brian not David. Ang lee is not A fan-boy it takes A fan-boy like Sam Raimi or Tim Burton to make A real superhero movie. Joel Schumachar is another non Fan-boy.,Hulk

You can feel the emotion while you watch it and you can tell that the material was taken very seriously. I loved this movie.  I liked the story, the flashbacks, and I loved the CGI image of the Hulk.  Some people thought it didn't look real, but I am sold. It was convincing enough for me to suspend my disbelief and the movie worked for me.  I think it sets the new standard for computer generated characters. In the wake of the terrorist attacks, I think these Marvel comics inspired movies are all tapping into something that no other movie can.  We all feel vulnerable/powerless at times and need our heros.  I loved X-men, X2, Spiderman, Daredevil (which was criminally under rated, btw), but this one might top them all because of the way all elements of the plot tie together so perfectly.",Hulk

319,odor007,A Film Bound By Its Own Genre...,10,25 June 2003,"Ang Lee's ""The Hulk"" is a film that's so good, so well acted, so well written, and so engaging that I found myself constantly wishing that it wasn't centered on a silly green superhero.  ""The Hulk"" is a film that puts all the recent comic adaptations to shame (""Spider-Man"" and ""Daredevil""), and is definitely the best superhero movie since Tim Burton's ""Batman.""
So why has this film been receiving such poor press?  Why are so many people on this site bashing everything from the script to the CGI?  It's simple really: American anti-intellectualism.  Those that liked ""Spider-Man"" enjoyed it for the exact reasons intelligent people hated it--it was hollow, predictable, had no real suspense or character development, was flat and tawdry, and the action seemed crammed in just to keep the ignorant from being bored.  Some claim that it was this fluff, this lack-of-seriousness, that made the movie ""great"": it treated the material as a comic book movie should be treated.  In a way, I agree with this way of thinking, but only with a comic character like ""Spider-Man"" would this work: he's a superhero that, unlike the Hulk, has no dimension.  He's a silly and flat character, and in a way, that should translate into a silly and flat movie (which it did).  This is not to say that ""Spider-Man"" couldn't be better, because I feel it could have in a million ways.  Hulk, on the other hand, isn't a good guy that fights crime day and night--he's far more complex and interesting. He's probably more bad than good, because his uncontrollable rages result in unprecedented destruction.  Instead of simply catering to morons by having the movie be non-stop smashing, Ang Lee and his screenwriter James Schamus decided to research the character and create a film more about his struggle than his tumultuous panics.  This care for the character Bruce Banner, his background, and his life shine through every frame, and this creates a sensation that's very rare in comic flicks.Yet even Ang Lee, art-house master, knows that a summer comic blockbuster wouldn't be complete without some serious action, and the final action sequences are the most stunning and visually imaginative since Ang Lee's own ""Crouching Tiger.""  In one scene, the Hulk, who can jump miles, jumps from a rocky canyon region to a silent desert while loads of planes and helicopters pursue him, trying to blow him to green sludge.  For a moment, as he lands in this serene desert, he has lost his enemies, and he softly tumbles down a sandy hill.  In the background we can hear the oncoming bombing assault. It's scenes like this that made ""The Hulk"" so enjoyable, fresh, and ingenious.  Ang Lee only gives us action after he has invested our care into his characters, and it means so much more then the boring action scenes performed in ""Spider-Man.""As far as the acting goes, it's top-notch for sure.  Some claim that while Eric Bana under-acts, both Nick Nolte and Sam Elliott overact. Personally, I think this goes against the theory that comic films should be fun--overacting is what it's all about.  Nick Nolte was so effectively creepy and bizarre that for me he carried the movie.  Jennifer Connelly was beautiful and touching, and when the film was over she had made more of a mark than other actresses in recent action films that sit and weep on the sidelines.  Sam Elliott was purely captivating, and for the first time in years captured the difficult decisions and emotions that are inherent in the military field within a very miniscule timeframe.  And finally, Eric Bana, as Bruce Banner: I felt his performance was just what it should have been. He didn't try to steal the show from his green counterpart, and he stayed true to the original Marvel Bruce Banner: calm, reserved and shy (which obviously creates a parallel to Hulk).  Schamus's script investigated more emotion and motivation behind the Hulk than any superhero film I think I've ever seen: and it's this serious tone that makes the movie so above and beyond the rest.  This doesn't ruin the film at all (as some say), but just makes the movie that much more fascinating.As far as the graphics go, I felt that they were FAR better than that of ""Spider-Man"" (where I was distracted by how bad the effects were). You can see just how difficult it must have been to create the hulk character, and the way he doesn't just appear but also interacts with his environment is great.  Yes, there were times during action scenes were he seemed to be made of silly putty, but they never got as flawed as in ""Spider-Man.""And finally, Ang Lee's hold on the film is crucial: the way he films it mimes a comic the entire time: wide angles and vibrant frames, and the editing swipes/fades/dissolves/ and split screens really recreate this sensation of turning the pages of a comic (I'm sure the creators of both of the last comic films wish they had thought of this).  Great stuff.In the end the movie had a great blend of seriousness and hokeyness, and made a far greater impression than any of the competition. Although it wasn't a great movie, it was a great action movie.  I do feel that it was a film that was so good it felt limited by it's own source material, but that's complimentary.",Hulk
320,shawny11_2001,Incredible!!!!!,9,21 June 2003,"That's about the only word that I can come up with to describe this absolute masterpiece of cinema. Hollywood can learn something from Ang Lee, but I doubt they ever will. Yet unlike many reviews I've read who were expecting a big guns action movie, this is far from it. It is a character piece, with some action thrown in on the side. Eric Bana was absolutely wonderful as Bruce Banner. He played the role perfectly. Jennifer Connely was a wonderful choice for Betty Ross. You could feel her sympathy and love towards Bruce and the Hulk in her eyes and voice. Nick Nolte is always a joy to see anymore. Sam Elliot portrayed Thunderbolt Ross briliantly. Ang Lee's use of split-screen was spectacular. It brought the comic-book essence that has been missing from many comic movies. It was like being a kid again, reading The Hulk outside the comic shop. And yet this is not a typical action movie. This is a character movie. It has suspense, drama, and a bit of action for those who've been brainwashed by Hollywood. Yet the action is in the end, but the story builds up to it.
I loved this movie. I'm incredibly happy that they finally got around to making a Hulk movie. It has been a few years coming, and boy was the wait worth every penny.",Hulk
321,Jenny Ho,Enjoyable film with impressive special effects but low on the re-watchability factor,7,23 July 2003,"Yup, it's yet another comic-strip superhero adaptation and for me personally, this film takes me back to my childhood.  The Incredible Hulk' was a famous television series when I was a child and was one of my brother's favourite programmes.  Unfortunately, he rarely got to watch the show in peace as the sound of the theme tune alone was enough to send me into floods of tears.  Even now, I can still vividly remember the transformation which was the source of my trauma: the bloodshot eyes and bulging green flesh becoming visible under the ripped material of Bruce Banner's shirt ..Director Ang Lee succeeds in capturing a comic strip feel in the film. Often the action is split-screen and the way that the camera switches between scenes mimics the way someone would scan the images when reading a comic. On the whole, the cast is good: Jennifer Connelly as Bruce Banner's ex-girlfriend is effectively tearful when necessary and Nick Nolte is disturbingly tramp-like and manic as the elderly David Banner.  The special effects are also very good; the Hulk is an impressive creation but as a result of being completely computer generated, he is not as scary as in the television version. What does come across in the film is the Hulk's awesome invincibility with his ability to smash up buildings; defeat mutant dogs and spin tanks around his head with ease (the violence is perhaps too much for young children).Unfortunately, I feel that the story telling does not really justify the need for the film to be over two hours in length.  Not much time is really spent on providing the background of the hero and as a result, you don't really get to know the main character and cannot sympathise with him.  In a speedy introduction, we learn that genetic scientist Dr David Banner has passed his self-mutilated genes on to his son Bruce through using himself as a guinea-pig for his genetic modification experiments.  Like his father, Bruce grows up to become a genetic scientist.  Following an incident in the lab which causes Bruce to be exposed to a dose of gamma rays, he transforms into the Hulk' in moments of stress or anger.  Other than that, there really is not much else other than the military finding out about this monster and seeking to capture and destroy him.  The film is also let down by a chaotic and silly ending and of course, like in the television series, you are still left wondering how Bruce's pants stay intact during his transformation!Overall, I did enjoy Hulk' but unlike some other comic book adaptations I've seen, this is not a film I would choose to watch again.",Hulk
322,Jack_Acid,"Worth seeing, but may lack longevity",7,24 June 2003,"As a huge fan of the Hulk as a kid, and a casual follower of the comic even beyond my youth, I had high expectations of this film.  I have to say that I enjoyed it, though I was frustrated by some key elements.The first and most glaring criticism (plot and action aside), this film was flat out too long.  They could have trimmed 20-30 minutes from it and it would have been more effective.  My second complaint was the skewed story line of the Hulk's coming into existence and the role of Bruce's father, played by Nick Nolte.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***Even after leaving the theater, I was still fuzzy on the whole intent of David Banner.  I was hoping for a classic Hulk nemesis, such as the Leader. With so much military influence in the film, the Leader seemingly would have made a perfect villain.With those complaints aside, the film did have a comic book feel and the struggles between Bruce and Betty and Betty and General Ross were well done. At first Bruce, though somewhat revolted, almost seems to enjoy the power he possesses, showcasing his dark and unstable side, which is well justified given his troubled youth.  There were hints towards the end however, that there was inner conflict between the Hulk and Banner, which is completely true from the comic.Bottom line: great effects and interesting cinematography.  A little long winded with a few oversights, but one that any fan of the Hulk, even casually, will enjoy.",Hulk

And I was eager to see the movie version.But 4 people made me hate the movie: ANG LEE, NICK NOLTE, DANNY ELFMAN and JAMES SCHAMUS.Bad directing, ridiculous plot/dialogue, pointless villain and the worst Elfman score I ever had the misfortune to listen to. (And I love Elfman's works.)The origin of the Hulk ... screwed up for the sake of ""seriousness"" that nobody asks or cares for.Good points?The Hulk CGI was ... good. (Maybe comic-spoilers) - Again, it looked more like ""Professor Hulk"" from the later comics when Bruce and Hulk are the same person. I didn't expect him to be gray (like in the original issue No. 1), but this?On the other hand ... he looked good. I can live with that.(end of spoilers)Please, if you do Hulk 2, get some serious action-director on board. (The movie manages to make HULK boring!) And another composer. And heck ...

325,bliss66,People crazy,8,23 July 2003,"I'm not sure what everyone is on about when they describe this as the worst film of the year (or ever)--it's every bit as good as, if not better than, last year's Spiderman.  It would appear there's something of a culture clash when an art house, albeit populist, filmmaker aims for a summer blockbuster. The only thing wrong with Hulk is the packaging as it seems to have misled the target audience into thinking it was going to be the same old/same old, though why people used to a reheated tv dinner would object to a gourmet meal is beyond me.  Hulk isn't your typical summer fare but at a time when Hollywood would seem to be choking on the fumes of completely exhausted formulaic full throttled sequels, one would think this kind of originality, flair and quality storytelling in a mainstream film would be more welcome. I guess those who flock to the multiplex prefer their beans on toast.Visually stunning, well written with excellent performances, Hulk's special effects are closely tied to the main character's journey of self-discovery--meaning they appear when necessary and when integral to the plot.  Most blockbusters are probably constructed in opposition to that credo.  Sam Elliot and Nick Nolte give terrific performances as fathers locked in a duel to the death while dealing emotional damage to their children (Connolly and Bana).  Connolly gives a respectable performance--which is more than can be said of her work in A Beautiful Mind--and is well cast as the feminine influence that calms the Hulk. Lee gives her character, Betty Ross, far more dignified material than Fay Wray or Jessica Lange ever got in their beauty and the beast vehicles.  Bana is obviously working to his director's very strict brief for his character, Bruce Banner, giving a very controlled, restrained performance.  It is some credit to Bana and Lee that the three actors who play Banner throughout the film all seem to be cut from the same cloth--Bana's Bruce is very much the adult we would expect such a muted, tormented child to become.  Bana, though not responsible for the cgi performance of his alter-ego, Hulk, serves this material well by serving the story--that's really all an actor is supposed to do.  (How can you grandstand when you're playng the Hulk?)  Lee paces Banner's trajectory from an emotionally controlled stick figure to a raging hulk with masterful assurance--I mean, what did people expect?  Banner would bust out of his shorts right after the opening credits?  Hulk is necessarily a slow burn, folks, leaving Lee and company some distance to travel.There are memorable, nail-biting sequences galore.  The derision that has greeted the cgi effects is just misplaced and goes to show how some initial bad word of mouth can easily sway the masses.  Frankly, I'm not sure what more people would expect--when the Hulk appears he seems every bit a product of genetic engineering, of scientific experiment gone wrong and yet somehow soulful.  The sequence with the genetically modified dogs is as terrifying as anything I've ever seen at a multiplex (and that would include the patrons).  When Hulk breaks out of his military prison and is pursued relentlessly across the desert as he tries to make his way back to Betty, it is completely engrossing as we discover the full extent of his endurance--by this point the film is in full flow.  I was sobbing by the end of the sequence as Connolly makes her way toward the Hulk and we see them both collapse into each other's arms--I mean, it's just a movie, folks.  What more do you want?  How about watching the Hulk being flown into the outer atmosphere and dropped from a staggering height?  It certainly left my mouth gaping.  Throughout, Lee's meticulous homage to Marvel Comic's framing puts the material--especially the script--in the perfect context.  It's like the film is bowing to it's origins throughout--it doesn't pretend to be realistic, it's about images and framing that immediately and economically communicate motion and pathos to the reader.  (I mean, cinema goer.) Characters speak with the economy of the thought bubbles or narration one would find in a comic book--it's refreshing to see this material transferred to another medium without losing the unique narrative of a comic book or graphic novel.  Lee is very faithful to the style of his source--as anyone who's actually read a Marvel comic would tell you.  Like all the great Marvel heroes, Hulk is about duality, about the shadow that is a part of all our characters.  By the time we arrive to the final showdown between Bruce Banner and his mad scientist father, David, Lee reveals the jewel in his crown:  Papa Banner, mercilessly winding up his freak of a son, says, ""The more I GET to you--the more you GIVE to me!""  It certainly sounded like the crux of a father/son relationship to me.  It's a moment that equals if not surpasses the ""with great power comes great responsibility"" ethos of Spiderman (an ethos that, rather ironically, has apparently gone ignored by Americans in their quest to remake the world in their own image) and acknowledges the darkness and depth of humanity that a comic book can reveal.Given the complete inanity of the trailers that preceded the film (formulaic retreads like SWAT, from the makers of 2 Fast 2 Stupid and, heaven help us, XXX--can't wait!), I suspect that multiplex audiences have been conditioned to consume large doses of destruction without any subtext and certainly without caution.  Hulk must have seriously disappointed those that just like their blockbusters to go BOOM! without questioning the nature of our destruction to ourselves and others.  Although the sad, unspoken commentary throughout is the level to which audiences have been dumbed down when a simple parable of this nature is somehow classified as demanding.  If nothing else, the response to Hulk exemplifies that audiences can no longer sit still and listen for longer than three minutes at a time.",Hulk
326,Rebochan,The Incredible Nothing,1,26 January 2006,"With the one-two punch of the entertaining Bryan Singer-helmed X-Men films and Sam Raimi's brilliant Spider-Man take, it seemed like comic films had finally found their way. It really WAS possible to tell the deep, moving plot line that has entranced comic readers for decades while including the requisite explosions that have also entranced comic readers for decades. Naturally, when I saw the trailer for the Hulk, I was expecting Bruce Banner to get an equally good treatment. I mean, they brought in Ang Lee, meaning they wanted a more serious exploration into the Hulk's multiple personas, right? And the man knows his wire-fu, so the action sequences would be good too, right?Wrong. The Hulk was one of the most painful theatrical experiences of my lifetime. It even managed to top Wild Wild West and The League of Extraordinary Gentleman for cinematic torture. Of course, that two hour run time of badness can do anyone in. At least those films were short enough to escape from. The Hulk is not only bad, it's long too. The more recent Batman Begins clocked in ten minutes longer than this and and it just zooms by while achieving everything the Hulk fails at. And that had the Memento guy helming it for crying out loud!Let's get something straight - many in the media and the internet are under the impression that The Hulk is some grand artistic opus overlooked by dumb theater goers due to lack of explosions. They laud it's artistic vision, it's brilliant insight into Banner's head, and a bunch of other artsy crap. These elements ARE NOT IN THIS FILM. The movie I saw was so caught up in convincing the audience it was smart that I was just waiting for the ""Oscar Moment"" subtitles to pop up. Sadly, it's hoodwinked quite a few people into its vision. People who should know better. Hence why this review exists.No, this film is a cinematic Seinfeld. This film is about nothing. On top of the title character not even appearing for the first third of the film - we learn absolutely nothing about Bruce Banner to make us care about him. He is a total blank slate. Eric Bana is a fine actor, but his Bruce is someone I never cared about. And there's plenty of angles they could have used to make Bruce intriguing, all of which Marvel Comics has gone in depth over(Grey Hulk anyone?). There's a lot to the Hulk character but Ang Lee never got it - he just liked making pretty pictures and vague plot points that amounted to nothing.Then there's the conflict with his father. Namely - his creepy dad is trying to do...something. The film doesn't really tell you what. It does use that clever smokescreen of being vague so you supposedly need to analyze to find the plot, but no, deep analysis reveals dad is nothing but a creepy old guy with mutant poodles. At the end of the film, his showdown with Bruce is nothing but a giant metaphor for...nothing.We get a lot of flashbacks, supposedly to establish conflict. They add nothing to the film except that Bruce's dad is Not A Good Person. We get shots into Bruce's head that are supposed to show an identity crisis. But since we never get anything resembling an identity from Bruce, there's no involvement in his crisis. And naturally, these scenes are way too long and go nowhere. That's not artistic vision - that's someone stumbling around trying to find something more to do with the concept than ""Hulk smash!"" There's nothing for the Hulk to define himself against - we are given a few vague sources of antagonism. The military sort of plays a role - nothing like a good cliché in our monster movie. But for a film that's supposed to be innovative in its presentation, how come the best they can up with for the military are nothing but tired clichés? It's as though they exist solely so someone can throw tanks at the Hulk.Oh, sure, there's action sequences, but those are boring too. The only thing the film gets right is that helicopters are not giant tanks of nitroglycerin waiting to go off at the slightest touch. But we do get a thirty minute or so chase sequence through the desert where Hulk jumps...and jumps...and jumps...and winds up in San Francisco so he can...wind up right back where he started! Oh sure, he overturns some tanks and helicopters on the way, but we just had a thirty minute chase sequence go absolutely nowhere but boy did it buffer that artistic runtime.Folks - do not be fooled. This film is not an unsung classic. It is undeserved of that praise. Bruce Banner's consciousness has been explored in depth in his comics since the 70's, and Ang Lee couldn't even get close to it in three hours. Even the TV series had a better shot at the character and he wasn't even named Bruce in that one. There are plenty of better three hour films out there, and plenty of better comic films out there.",Hulk
327,jamesnicholls-58600,The most underrated film of all time,10,17 May 2019,"I first watched this film in 2003 when I was a little kid, despite it being a film more fitting for mature audiences I still understood it to a certain extent and enjoyed it. When the other Hulk film came out in 2008, I initially enjoyed that one more because it had more action in it and I was still too young to appreciate the story of the Ang Lee Hulk film fully. Then a few years later I rewatched Ang Lee Hulk and realised just how great it was and how underrated it was. My point is, only intelligent people realise how great this film is, and from my life experience I can prove that personally as I didn't like this film nowhere near as much during my childhood when I was of course less intelligent than I am now. If people were smarter on average the ratings for this film would be far higher.I thought the CGI in this film was brilliant, especially for it's day. It's quite pathetic that with the new Ruffalo Hulk in the Avengers, they have millions more dollars to spend extensive CGI work done to that and newer technology but despite that Ang Lee's Hulk still looks better in my opinion. The Hulk in this film not only looks the most ferocious out of all the Hulk incarnations from films but it's also truer to the comics as well, in this film Hulk actually grows in size the angrier he gets unlike in the other films and his colour is also more accurate to the comics, more green and in general more of a better colour. Another reason why I think the 2003 Hulk character is better is because Hulk in this film seems to far more powerful than the 2008 version and more powerful than the new one, for example I can't imagine the Hulk from this movie losing to Thanos like the Hulk from the MCU did because this Hulk actually had unlimited power and clearly got much stronger the angrier he got.A lot of people criticise this film because it doesn't have as much action of the Hulk smashing things. But that's part of the problem, if the typical Marvel fan got what they wanted then 90% of this film would've just been non-stop action involving the Hulk, but that's simply not what intellectuals crave, certainly not in that enormous quantity, of course though if it was like that then it would be hardly any different from a typical MCU movie of today but probably even worse. I think it had a good mix of action, drama and emotion in this film. If Marvel fans want mindless action then they should go see a random Bruce Willis flick instead, this film is for smart people who appreciate the sheer emotion this film dishes out.I think Thunderbolt Ross was far better in this than the other Hulk films. The Thunderbolt Ross in the 2008 version was pretty much straight up villain whereas the one from this film was more like an anti-hero, a grey character, which made him all the more interesting. He actually had legitimate reasons to go after the Hulk which made the film more tragic. meaningful and memorable. The acting was superb, to the extent I think all the actors/actresses did a well above average job in this film with the possible exception of Jennifer Connelly, but her great looks make up for it. I was very impressed with the anger the actors portrayed, it seemed very real and realistic nothing like the so called anger MCU characters have in the MCU films nowadays.The action scenes were superb such as the Hulk vs mutant dogs scene, Hulk vs the army and of course Hulk vs his Dad at the end. I liked the fact some of the camera shots were like a comic book and it also made fans connect closer to Bruce at the time, as his angry mind and eyes during those comic book scenes would've been all over the place so the comic book movie scenes really do help the viewer connect with Bruce in that regard. Eric Bana's Bruce Banner wasn't so geeky compared to Norton's and Ruffalo's Banner, and I liked that aspect. The 2003 Banner also had much more of a backstory than any of the others, and it certainly turned out to be an interesting background. The 2003 Banner is a far more complex character than the others, mainly due to his background, the 2008 one and Ruffalo version on the other hand, well we hardly hear anything of their backstories at all, at least the 2003 version has plenty of backstory information available to viewers.Last but certainly not least I would just like to say that David Banner from this movie is my favourite Marvel villain ever Very complex villain and a lot more grey than people might initially think. It's very interesting working out some of his hidden motives in the film, I recommend fans of this film to watch the film again but watch it from David Banner's perspective, it's extremely interesting. David Banner was a very power hungry villain, that's the thing he cared about the most but his love for his wife and his Son when he was a small boy (before he tried to kill him and before he wanted to harness his Son's powers for himself) has made me sympathise for him which makes all the more interesting and tragic villain. I recommend this film to anyone who has a mind and has patience.",Hulk
328,thrix,Actually better than expected,10,19 July 2003,"Not having seen the original series/movies, I didn't have too high expectations on this movie than it rather being just another throwout in the 'action' cathegory. I was wrong. The beginning was somewhat confusing and didn't improve my assumptions much, but as the story went on I was almost breathtaken by the scenery, camera shooting and effects, not to mention the excellent story. Much of the praising must go to Ang Lee, undoubtfully a master director shown with 'The Hulk' if you did not yet know of him from crouching tiger hidden dragon. 9/10.",Hulk
329,Ken-120,"Suspenseful, Thoughtful and above all, Smashing!",8,20 June 2003,"Remembering the debacle of the Schumacher Batman and Robin, it is wonderful to see that the superhero film genre has come a long way.Ang Lee has taken one of Marvel's most iconic character and successfully made the best kind of cross between the action of Spider-Man and the sheer intelligence of Unbreakable with the faithfulness to the spirit of the comic as the X-Men series.Ang Lee made the perfect choice with Eric Bana with his haunted nature darkening even his happy moments with what lies just below his surface. Jennifer Connelly is ideal as Betty Ross, the steadfast love shows such courage and commitment for her love who carries such a bizarrely dangerous curse.  Nick Nolte is the perfect villian, expanding on the original comic idea of Bruce's abused childhood and wow, Sam Elliot is the perfect actor for General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross!People complain about the dialouge, but for me, the enhanced the film wtih the resulting suspense, first for the gamma rad accident that would curse Bruce and after waiting to see if the next minute will be the one that pushes him over the edge and unleashes the Hulk.  The suspense is so strong, it is a relief for the change to occur.  Once it happens, the Hulk is incredibly expressive with only his face!  He is a child cut off from the rest of the world and can barely understand it as it is, especially with the baddies he has to smash.Speaking about the smashing, each Hulk sequence is wonderful.  The 1st time is heartrending as the Hulk wrecks the lab and Bruce's life's work in an analogy of his life.  By the far the best is Hulk's battle with Ross' forces in the most classic kind with Ross throwing everything he has to stop the creature while Hulk gives as good as he gets.And for all the mayhem, nothing is more traumatic to Banner than the recovery of his painful past which contributed to his difficult present and facing the horrible man who caused it.  That is the heart of this drama and the film is better for it.True, it could be cut for time, but on the whole, a wonderful film about a man who we like when he's angry.8/10",Hulk
330,raptor_2,Big Green Soul,9,29 October 2003,"*WARNING*  SPOILERSWhat happens when, expecting a big, loud, dumbed down summer action movie, you get something that is character driven, well acted, and has even better action than any of the other summer movies?According to most people, it seems you get disappointed.To me, ""Hulk"" is a wonderful film (although I still wish it had the words ""The Incredible..."" before it).  I love it to death.  I saw it four times in theaters, loved the story, and felt what it was like to be the Hulk. However, it's NOT a summer movie.  The acting is too subtle, the script too rich, and the film's overall soul too deep to be widely accepted by people looking for a quick escape during the summer (not to knock other summer movies though).I won't recap the plot, as it has been done over and over.  What I will say is that the makers of the film weave the story of poor old Bruce Banner in a weird, intriguing way.  The script plays the characters like chords on a dying violin.  However, one of those strings vibrates so loud it shakes the whole instrument.  All the characters are well written, with distinctive dialogue, and little hints at each of their lives.  It is like a subtle, yet vibrant, symphony. 
The acting is near perfect.  From the second I saw him in the dorky bike helmet, Eric Bana was Bruce Banner.  However, as good as he and the rest of the cast are, sometimes they are too subdued (sometimes with Bana and a little too often with the great Jennifer Connelly) or too emphatic (Nick Nolte, although perhaps I not seeing just how clearly insane he was).  Josh Lucas was a bit too one-dimensional in his portrayal of Glenn Talbot, but perhaps that's the scripts fault for giving him a slimy weasel to play in a soulful film.  However, Sam Elliot strikes all the right notes as good old General Thunderbolt Ross.  But, nonetheless, I felt for everyone in the film...except really for Talbot (but, strange as it sounds, especially for David Banner).The special effects are as top notch as you'd expect them to be in a big budget movie, but it's what Ang Lee does with them that makes them special. Instead of just pointing the camera at the effects (as, to me, was what it felt like watching ""X2"", even though I do like that movie) he shifts focus around things, letting the camera fly as the Hulk jumps, bringing the experience of the film to life.  Even in the quiet moments, when Hulk is just looking at Betty or a desert flower, I still enjoy looking at him. But, he's still more fun when he's throwing tanks around.Danny Elfman's music perfectly sets the mysterious, violent, and deep tone of the film, with excellent uses of bombastic tones and quiet, sad vocals that help bring out the soul of the movie.  However, considering this is from the man who made the great `Batman' score, is it too much to ask for a little Hulk theme music?And then, of course, there's the famous (or infamous) editing.  To me, it made otherwise boring things, like Bruce and Betty's lab, interesting. However, it did get unnecessary a time or two (do we really need to see the helicopter carrying Bruce into the desert from five different angles?) Also, it wasn't used as much during the Hulk action scenes, where I think it could have made cool scenes even cooler.  Imagine seeing Hulk fight the dogs from five different angles!  All these things on their own are great, but it's when they're all added up that the movie gets its great, big soul.  I felt all the pain David and Bruce felt for their lives when David talks about how he accidentally killed his wife, heightened by the great acting, editing, and the music that made the whole scene seem to cry.  I longing between Betty and her father for the great relationship that could have been.  But all that just makes me care more for the movie.  What made me love it was the feeling of being the Hulk as he jumped for miles at a time.  I still get teary eyed at the pure joy of that one, long shot as Hulk just runs and jumps over the canyons, the music of pure freedom playing behind him.Without the soul of the movie, it would be a great package of great parts of acting and special effects and all that.  With just that, I'd give it an 8 out of 10, since it still has a few faults.  But it's with that soul, that big green Hulk soul that has all the basic human emotions wrapped up in their purest, most exciting forms and put on screen, that I love this movie dearly, and look past it's faults to give it a 9, or even a 9 and ½ or a 10. But numbers can't measure love very well, so I guess I shouldn't try.Knowing how great the film is now, I know it would have been torture to have to wait for it to be released at a more opportune time, like in the winter, when most of the other, more thoughtful movies are usually released with a chance at the box office.  However, I think Universal should have pushed it for Christmas with an advertising campaign that focused on the soul of the movie instead of the action, which as I saw firsthand, made some people think it would be too corny.  Maybe then it would have been accepted better. But, maybe by choosing Ang Lee, the film was destined receive mixed views, as those expecting a mindless action `Hulk' would be disappointed and those wanting a deep character study would not like the action.  Lee said in an interview (and I'm paraphrasing here), that he saw little difference between dialogue scenes and action scenes, as both served ways of progressing the story.  I guess most moviegoers couldn't see it that way.  But, I feel fortunate to have `gotten' this movie, because it touched me with its heart, and rocked me with its muscle.  Maybe the summer during a major war wasn't a good time for a deep, thoughtful, big budget movie to be released.  Maybe it will be better accepted in the future when people can look back and reflect on it, who knows. But I sure know now that I love this movie to death, and no mixed reviews can take that away from me.",Hulk
331,lawnboy1977,Not even a shot of Gamma rays could save this film!,5,21 June 2003,"When I first saw this film in the theaters on opening day 2 years ago I was impressed. I thought that Ang Lee did a good job for really capturing the fury of the Hulk with his directorial style. After having watched this film a few more times, I realized there were a lot of holes in the film that aggravated me. The beginning of the movie was absolutely horrendous. There was probably a good hour of nothing other than Banner working in the lab and talking to his girlfriend Jennifer Connelly. I had no problems with the casting in this one, Bana, Connelly and Sam Elliott were all solid, but there were too many variances on the comic book version of Hulk's origin that didn't make sense. What was the deal with Banners father, played by Nick Nolte? I don't ever remember his father being mentioned once in the comics, let alone becoming some sort of electrically charged monster. You can tell this was a studio driven movie as the story is a choppy and it leaves a lot to be desired. It has its moments, but in the end, they really butchered the legacy of the Hulk, one of the greatest comic book superheroes of all time.",Hulk
332,pjmuck,"Yep, it's as awful as it looks",2,20 June 2003,"Being a marvel comic collector all of my childhood, I was eager to see this film when I first heard about it. And then, over the course of many months, we were fed trailers that revealed more and more of the Hulk's rendering with each subsequent trailer. If you were like me, you cringed at each of these trailers, as it seemed apparent, even in what little they showed of the Hulk, that the computer generated results were terrible. But after all, realism isn't everything, especially in a fantastic and fictional storyline. After all, King Kong is still a highly entertaining classic with a good storyline, and nobody would ever mistake the stop motion in that film for a real gorilla. So I decided to shrug off the less than satisfying animation that was briefly revealed in the trailers and go see the film anyway. I'm sorry I did.The first half of the film was fairly engaging, as the plot started to unfold and you're left wondering where it will lead to (other than the obvious and eventual transformation). But then you wait...and wait...and wait..., and finally we get the first transformation, aka the emergence of the title character. And then it's obvious, without a shadow of a doubt, that the animation is terrible. (anyone who's impressed with the visuals must think Gumby's a masterpiece of animation as well). The movement isn't fluid, and I've seen better work in Playstation games. Fine, if that's the way it's gonna be then at least we have some good acting and a good plot to carry it along, right? Wrong. While I did enjoy Sam Elliot's and Nick Nolte's performances, the leads are incredibly stiff with no chemistry at all. And the plot doesn't go anywhere, except for a last minute after thought to inject an arch villian into the climax, which ends up being just about the most anti-climactic finale I've seen in along time.
About the only positive comment I can make about the film is that it appears that Ang Lee at least tried to do a different kind of superhero film, and while many have stated that the multiple split screen shooting style was annoying, I at least found it an interesting and unique way to show a scene. Problem is, do we really need to see 5 multiple camera angles of a scene when there's nothing going on in the first place? IMO, the worst offering in the Marvel film series yet.",Hulk
333,redbirds525,Was that the Hulk or The Jolly Green Giant,6,20 June 2003,"I will be honest..the trailers and commercials made me not want to see this movie. I was a big fan of the TV show. When I saw the Hulk looking like a 12 foot Jolly Green Giant instead of how he was on TV, it kind of turned me away. But when I woke up this morning, I started reading the reviews and figured what the heck?Overall, it was not a bad movie. Eric Bana did an excellent job as Bruce Banner. And any movie with Jennifer Connelley is all right for me. The two actors that really stole the show were Sam Elliott as Connelly's Army General father and Josh Lucas (from SWEET HOME ALABAMA). Nick Nolte looked like he just walked out of his DUI arrest.The only real problems I had was the fact that the Hulk was twelve feet tall and looked like the Jolly Green Giant. It would have been better if an actual actor played the role as Lou Ferrigno did on TV. I guess that's what we've come to expect in the world of CG. The other thing I hated was the fact that kept doing the split screen thing. HELLO PEOPLE..this is a movie, not a comic book. This annoyed the heck out of me. Also, the ending was kind of corny. Made me say out loud ""all ritey then.""Oh, don't take the kiddies to this. It was PG-13 for a reason. This is NOT Spider-Man. Some pretty disturbing scenes involving animal experimentation, especially in the beginning credits. And there were was a pretty violent scene when the Hulk was fighting the mutant dogs. This could have very well been an ""R"". Other than that, this was an enjoyable movie. It was better than Spider Man. Worth a matinee price. Rating 6 out of 10.",Hulk
334,ollie1939-97-957994,An overlooked film,5,4 July 2011,I really liked this film but this film has gotten a mixed response from both audiences and critics. I was quite surprised but I can understand why. It's trying to be more of a serious film than your average popcorn film. It's trying to tell a story rather than have lots of action and I think that's what Ang Lee (the director) was trying to do and I really liked that. The performances are really good particularly Eric Bana as the Hulk and Nick Nolte as his father. Like everyone else I would have liked to see more action and the biggest one takes place in the desert. It would have been funner if the Hulk was in the city and smashing buildings up but I can't have everything I want. A thing that I had mixed feelings for was they were trying to make it look like a comic book and it had this annoying cross dissolves thought that was a bit annoying. I didn't like Jennifer Connely as I thought she was pretty useless. Overall I think this is the most overlooked superhero film ever made and I like this one more than the Edward Norton film that came out in 2008,Hulk
335,BrohmaBull007,It Was Good,7,17 February 2006,I don't understand why people hate this movie. I thought it was a good film. They really did capture the essence of the Hulk. To start the plot was strong. I do have to say that there were a lot of holes but overall I say the plot was a very good one for this movie. You would look at this and you would think this is going to be a brainless reek havoc on the city sort of movie but Bruce and the alter ego known as hulk have depth. Hulk isn't just some green guy who is mad he actually shows emotions of sadness and guilt as well as confusion. I occasionally read the Hulk comics from time to time and I must say they did a great job. The roars of the Hulk really blew me away in the theatre. They once again capture a comic book hero as it is in the comics. This like the other comic book movies deserves a sequel because I fell a little more needs to be told. Overall not much more to say except it was good.7/10,Hulk
336,Jisk,"Nick Nolte is obvnoxious, but otherwise...",5,25 June 2003,"After reading some fairly negative reviews of this film, I have to sayI was pleasantly surprised when I finally did see it for myself. Ithought that the performances were entertaining and the greengiant looked fantastic. Everyone in the theatre seemed to belaughing out loud when he came onto the screen - NOT LAUGHING AT HIM! We were all just so enthralled we could notstifle our joy at seeing him throw, smash, jump, etc. for the veryfirst time.          Less enthralling was the character of the bad-guy dad, playedby Nick Nolte. It was depressing to see Nolte acting so crazy afterthat mugshot of his - it didn't really seem like he was even acting insome parts, and there is one scene (at least) with him that is justtruly awful - embarassingly so.         That said, the movie itself is well worth the price of a ticket. Itgets a little bogged down with its' protracted scenes ofpsychobabble - Betty and her father, Betty and Bruce, Bruce andhis father, etc. etc. But when the not-so jolly green giant is on thescreen, watch out for some serious fun. I was thrilled completelyby him.         Another thing about this film I liked at times was the splitscreen stuff they did. It was overused a little bit, but they seemed tofind new ways of using it and the editing was unbelievable, aswere the special effects, and most of the acting.       Overall an enjoyable experience, and one I would definitelyrecommend. Watch out too for a great ending scene; it will leaveyou with visions of superheroes and waiting for more...",Hulk

339,jonathan45,Why hire Lee if you wont let him work?,6,14 February 2007,"When i first heard that Ang Lee was chosen to direct The Hulk i was pleasantly surprised, an established Oscar winning art director picked for what was inevitably written to be a popcorn -'whack an explosion in every five minutes'- brain anaesthetic.Not that there is anything wrong with dumb*ss movies, they can be fun and entertaining if there done 'right' and don't dominate the box office, leaving people, who want something, anything else scurrying for cable or DVD. I was further gratified when i saw the actors he had chosen Nick Nolte ( who always was an art movie actor in a leading mans clothes), Eric Bana ,who turned in one brilliant performance in Chopper...then nothing else since but i was prepared to give him a chance since i knew he could be good again. Ang also chose sundry other top quality supporting talent, all this raised my level of excitement. The film itself was a sad disappointment, the film seemed to be fighting with itself over whether to be an intellectuals art movie about the themes of violence being learned by a son witnessing his fathers violence and reconciliation with ones own inner rage, and the strange grim future science may offer us if unharnessed by cynical interests. Contrasting with the Hollywood Hulk bursting through walls and flipping cars over but with no real reason why. The result was a film that left both sides of the audience let down. There was a much better film under the surface that could have pleased both but it never emerged. There are action films that have good clever, even erudite scripts and exciting fast paced tension ( the French Connection, The Wire, Sopranoes) so why not here. Sadly this was an all too rare example of Hollywood executives taking a risk on a great director and letting him loose on a potential action franchise i suspect this film will limit the chances of this sort of symbiosis being green lit again.",Hulk
340,dung_rat,A defense of HULK...,8,17 November 2004,"*MILD SPOILERS*To begin with, it's simply not 'right' that HULK has received so much negative criticism. Of course, it's still receiving the obligatory slurs from a mob of po-faced fan-boys, pedantic 'nerds' or simply those who are too myopic to see past (pointless) comparisons with other Marvel franchises; say, Spider-man, for example.What HULK presents us with is a very engrossing and entertaining piece of cinema. Granted the pace may be a little slower than other 'hero' flicks that's not to say that it is lacking story, motive, superb effects (think what you will), and a unique directorial style. I personally found the CGI HULK to be a real success. It was near impossible to make it not look so animated but during fight/action scenes it really does not become a factor.The direction is certainly above par and the cinematography and arrangement stinks of quality. I was particularly impressed with the way that Ang Lee utilizes the 'story board' effect throughout the film. Scenes literally move from frame-to-frame in a similar manner to regular comic books. Sure, it's a gimmick but it does work surprisingly well regardless of the kitsch factor. Lee manages to focus on the troubled nature of the HULK/Banner identity 'crisis' which culminates in the HULK coming across as a very tragic character  someone who wants to do right yet due to circumstances out of his reach, doesn't always do so. In that respect it has a very appropriate and contemporary feel about it.Eric Bana does a good job as the subdued and (mildly) introverted Bruce Banner and Nick Nolte proves that he's still very much on top form playing a sort of haggard, wino-looking villain  Bruce's father...who appears to become the Absorbing Man. What's really worth noting is the prolonged scene in the desert where the HULK takes on a slew of military muscle  tanks, helicopters and such, in an all-out acrobatic fight  it's in true comic book style and an amazing feat. It reminds me of the old HULK cartoon I loved as a child! In closing, I wanted to defend this film because it seems that most people didn't even give it a chance. Those who did were far too willing to pan it before it could gain anything as much as a good reputation. Bana has personally said that he was very happy with the outcome and there is indeed a strong following of viewers (fans or not) who found this to be a far superior film to the likes of (the lamentable) Daredevil, or (no-brain) X-men. Hopefully it will stand the test of timeit deserves to.",Hulk
341,toby-brace,Underrated work of art,9,26 June 2013,"This film demonstrates the danger that lies in making a film which does not conform to expectations of the genre. The criticisms of it were unjustified and ludicrous in equal measure. It is a beautifully crafted and highly creative piece of film making. Ang Lee really tried to make something like a moving comic book, and not some childish comic but more like the kind of adult scripted graphic novels of Frank Miller. At times it was really breathtaking how the animated and CGI effects became a kind of moving artwork. I also thought the characterization and story were way beyond what you might expect from such material, really quite credible and moving. A brilliant piece of work that was just too innovative for the simple minded viewers and snobbish uptight reviewers who trashed it.",Hulk
342,DerBarenJude,Definitely above most comic book movies,8,9 May 2004,"The first thing that struck me about the Hulk, prior to its beautiful CGI special effects, was its ambition.  Ang Lee, in bringing the Incredible Hulk to life, has created a rather original movie.  It is impossible not to compare the movie to the comic book itself in its format, as I am sure was intentional.  For those unfamiliar with the extremely long-running comic book, Ang Lee's film captures the Hulk in his purest form:  pure, unadulterated rage.  Without giving away too much of the plot, Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk when he loses control of his anger.  Chaos ensues.  Now for the details:The Hulk looks great.  Even for those not very enamored with CGI, the amount of emotion portrayed by the Hulk's computer generated face is magnificent. The animation flawlessly blends with reality, and one forgets that there is even a mixture of the two.  There are moments in the film where I was struck by the beauty of the setting, particularly in the desert scenes.  Watching the monster glide through the air made me think of Crouching Tiger, even though the similarities are minimal.  Ang Lee has created art, an original piece of film-making about an old, overdone story.Now for the rest:  the acting is good, if not great.  Jennifer Garner is a wonderful actress, and her skills are a bit under-utilized here.  The actor playing Banner is good, and conveys the self-anguish inherent in his character well.  The plot is very good, often surprising even Marvel enthusiasts.  This film caught a lot of flack for many reasons, but I think that is the result of this film being so over-publicized.  Ang Lee has made a film worthy of his talents, and even non-Marvel fans should be able to appreciate this original movie.",Hulk
343,El_Rey_De_Movies,"A thinker's ""Hulk""",8,3 November 2005,"There are a lot of people who disliked this movie, and a lot of critics who panned it. I look at this movie, and I see another prime example of ""not getting it"", of public and critics expecting one type of movie, getting another, and feeling disappointed and angry over it. Ang Lee, who directed ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""The Ice Storm"" and ""Sense and Sensibility"", would seem an odd choice to direct this adaptation of the long-running and much-beloved Marvel Comics anti-hero, but it's precisely his talent for exploring character and motivation that lifts ""Hulk"" significantly over the soap-opera melodramatics of ""Spiderman"" or ""Daredevil"". I've read reviews from people complaining that you don't see the Hulk until almost the half-hour mark, but what they don't get is that Lee uses that time to build the characters of Bruce Banner, Betty Ross and her father, General Ross, into believable and well-rounded people whose fate we care about. What also grabs your eyes is the dazzling array of cinematographic tricks that Lee uses, from multi-panel scenes straight out of a comic-book to some of the coolest and artiest scene changes you'll ever see in a movie. But let's not forget the main attraction here: the big green giant, the Hulk, a massive CGI creation that still expresses the full gamut of human emotions while creating havoc throughout the Southwest and San Francisco. If all you want to see is a movie with a big green guy yelling, ""Hulk smash!!!!"" then this is not for you. If you want to see a comic-book movie that combines human drama, super-heroics, state-of-the-art computer imagery, and old-fashioned adventure then go soak in some gamma rays, put on a tearable t-shirt and go pay a visit to that mild-mannered Dr. Banner  you'll get insight, but you'll never get a cure.",Hulk

I am also a fan of the Hulk character, so my hopes fr this movie were pretty high.I'm torn about my opinion of this movie, because I think it's great that the story has such intelligent, adult themes and introspective looks at the characters, rather than one-line meaningless dialog of most of the other comic book adaptations, I think the effects are superb, direction faultless (I love the little comic book style visual breaks up on the screen) and superb photography.However, the story is ultimately too grand, and at the end rather confusing, you leave this movie just confused. The love connection between Jennifer Connely's character Eric Bana's Bruce/Hulk is just not believable. In my opinion Connely completely over acts everything in this movie, making her time on screen annoying. The pacing of the story is also too slow, I mean it takes over 40 minutes to finally see the Hulk. The Hulk action sequences are superb, and once they start yo get the sense that the movie will pick up, but in the end the actions sequences are separated by too much exposition and character development, and a slowing down of pace.As I said, the ending is confusing and a let down on previous action sequences, which is why i say this movie promises a lot but doesn't deliver. The direction is good, but the pace too slow, the action sequences are great, but too few and far between, Bana is excellent, but not given good dialog (it's a shame and a surprise he isn't returning for the sequel, he is really is good).I think this movie is ultimately great example of how hard it is to get big budget comic book adaptations right. Do you go for the comic book crowd and alienate those that don't know the Hulk and his history? Do you dumb it down and annoy the true fans? Do you skew it towards the young fans and negate story, leaving older fans feeling left out, or do you go for a more mature movie, leaving the kids screaming for action? I guess these guys tried to do it all, but ultimately that's caused it to be disjointed and unfulfilling, although still better than most comic book adaptations.",Hulk
346,Bob_647,"Interesting, quality look at an unusually cursed super hero.",9,13 June 2020,"Like the Frankenstein stories that are its predecessors, ""Hulk"" is a warning about the folly of those who would toy with the secrets of life. It is about the anguish of having powers you did not seek and do not desire. ""What scares me the most,"" Banner tells his only friend, Betty Ross, ""is that when it happens, when it comes over me, when I totally lose control, I like it."" Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" (the movie's title drops ""the"") is the most talkative and thoughtful recent comic book adaptation. It is not so much about a green monster as about two wounded adult children of egomaniacs. Banner (Eric Bana) was fathered by a scientist (Nick Nolte) who has experimented on his own DNA code, and passed along genes that are transformed by a lab accident into his son's hulkhood. Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) is his research partner; they were almost lovers, but it didn't work out, and she speaks wryly of ""my inexplicable fascination with emotionally distant men."" Her cold father is General Ross (Sam Elliott), filled with military bluster and determined to destroy the Hulk.Spiderman (in particular) follows the exact steps you can read in a tutorial for film making that may be neat to watch but leaves no space for surprises or artistic inputs. Ang Lee seems to have taken especially this thought very seriously and created a piece of art that the average pop corn formula film liking movie goer may find hard to digest. No doubt, this movie is not made for assembly line film lovers. It is constructed very thoughtfully and goes beyond the interpretation of a superhero. It plays with the chaos that erupts out of the events rather than glorifying another world savior.There is no real good and evil, there only is an overcharge from both
sides that don't know how to master the situation. The American movie goer averagely wants black and white sides, a proud United States flag waving and a hero that saves the day (nation and eventually the world, maybe even the universe). Nope, not in this one. While most of the other films establish superheroes as something that fits perfectly into our society, Hulk plays with the idea of what would happen if unknown uncontrolled unnameable power surfaces and that both sides act incredibly humane. At this point 80% of movie-consumers are out and 90% of movie-lovers come in (that number is small as we know).The crux is that this movie does not know who it's aimed at. The intellectual Ang Lee connoisseur picks his nose when it comes to the Hulk, simply due to its humble roots, while the average pop corn cinema goer is slightly irritated when confronted with the films odd approach to comic movies. This means that only viewers which are a bit of both can truly appreciate this masterpiece.The movie brings up issues about genetic experimentation, the misuse of scientific research and our instinctive dislike of misfits, and actually talks about them. Remember that Ang Lee is the director of films such as ""The Ice Storm"" and ""Sense and Sensibility,"" as well as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""; he is trying here to actually deal with the issues in the story of the Hulk, instead of simply cutting to brain less special effects.All the other elements for a good piece of entertainment are there and present: Eric Bana is, as usual, fine as the tormented soul which manifests itself in green rage, Jennifer Connelly is as solid as ever and Nick Nolte steals the show with what is a truly weird turn as Bruce Banner's/the Hulk's dad. The visual effects are beautifully executed as well. There is not much left to be desired.Five years later the audience won and an assembly line version was released, not as bad as some others but definitely not as creative and visionary as this one. Great job Ang!!!",Hulk
347,j_crist,Terrible (maybe Spoiler),1,22 November 2003,"Another comic book superhero becomes a horrible movie. For sure Ang Lee was not the right director for this film. The movie is terribly slow and become annoying after a little while, to me allready from the start. Lets say that a good chunk of it could have been removed in the editing, so that one hour of good material could have been the result of the final film if not less... but regardless the script... Fancy cut away F/X from scene to scene and split screen aren't enough to give a good tempo to the movie. The 3D Hulk is bad, nothing compared to the TV show. Honestly why did they do it? But the worst of it is the story. It's impressive that such a crappy story even get produced these days. My reccomendation is to avoid the film so that they won't make enough profit and in the future those kind of silly production would be avoided. Isn't that Ang Lee is getting a little bit overrated now. I believe any other director could have done a decent work they didn't need him, he has certainly slown down the film a lot... without considering the many jump cuts through the whole picture, what's with that?",Hulk

But surprisingly it wasn't really all that bad.As far as story and plot and special effects it was pretty good.  The only problem I had with it was the way that the talking scenes were quiet and the scary or fighting scenes were way louder.Oh and the stupid scene at the end, which you will have to see to understand, was stupid.  I don't really go for those fights in the clouds, sort of thing.It had some neat special effects though and some ""Green Giant"" type tricks that were fun to watch.  I liked Jennifer Connely & Eric Bana, they had some good chemistry.   It really had a comic book feel to it too, which was kind of fun.Eric Bana has really dark eyes so it was fun watching them turn green.  And of course Jennifer Connely is incredibly beautiful and a good actress.  I guess she seems like the perfect tragic mate to some crazy men, like in a beautiful mind, the hulk, requiem for a dream, etc.",Hulk

I have really enjoyed the effects and how he just smashes everything to bits. Everybodys hero should in fact be the Hulk because you could count on him to do your dirty work. I have also liked the many games they have released of the Hulk because it puts you in his shoes, what would you do if you were big, green, muscular and had an appetite for destruction, I think it would be pretty cool to have a bullet proof body. One thing I could not understand that if he grows stronger by getting even more mad, that means shoot him right? Wrong. General Ross figured that out the hard way.",Hulk

354,CC_The_Martian,A miserable confused experience,1,4 April 2016,"Wow. Justjust wow. Dear god in heaven. This film is one of the worst, most sorry excuses for coherent cinema I have ever seen, it's bad but it's the worst kind of bad, it's 'no fun at all' bad, it's 'cry out for humanity' bad, it's don't even think of trying to watch by yourself bad. This movie is horrendous. In order to go over how this movie fails across the board I have to go over the worst aspects one by one. Acting: this film's acting is some of the worst I have ever seen. None of the actors or actresses give believable performances, everyone sounds like they're here for their paychecks. Effects: this film uses primitive CGI and so the effects are horrible you can practically see the little numbers and lines from production. Story: this movie has one of the most needlessly complicated plots I have ever tried to slog through; characters do random inexplicable things, nothing makes sense, clichés manage to work their way in there, and with a concept like Hulk its amazing that this film manages to be no fun at all, there's a scene where Hulk's dad sends a trio of hulk dogs to try and kill the love interest forsome reason and hulk has to fight them, about one fourth of the way through the scene you're bored. Let me say that again, a scene with the incredible Hulk fighting a trio of Hulk dogs becomes BORING!!! Music: the music is uninspired and lazy, Danny Elfman at his worst which is frustrating because Darkman and Nightbreed have proved that the man can do so much better. Tone: this film is way, way too serious, it has not the first clue what kind of material it's working with and tries to do it's best to create a thought provoking movie, It fails. Cinematography: this movie goes for a really really pretentious visual style with big wide far away shots, mainly of deserts, instead of giving a sense of scale which I think was the intention it just makes the film feel big and hollow. The editing: this is where I actually have my biggest problem with this movie: this film's visual style is so out of place and so jarring it actually breaks the illusion. Not even the worst Ed Wood movies did that for me. Ang Lee seems to be playing a game called 'transition the scene in a different way ever time', sometime the next scene slides across, sometimes it comes out from the centre, sometimes it comes from on top and once it even flow upward all wavy like water. I am not kidding. Aside from the scene transition game this movie also tries to have a style which brings comics book panels to mind with two different but related scenes or even the same scene but from different angles happening right next to the each other with a thick black line in-between. The comic book panel thing is creative and in a better movie it might have worked but this is a movie that's going out of its way to be serious a thought provoking, it can't do that with comic book panels and clumsy scene transitions. This movie is a black hole of fun, Hulk is one of the most simple and fun concepts in all of superherodom but this movie sucks it all away, the movie's two hour runtime and lacklustre feel mean that it overstays it's welcome fast. The only good I could possibly see this film bringing is as an endurance test for the most die-hard cults of bad movie fanatics. Every copy of this film needs to be hunted down and destroyed, with fire, it's the only way aside from maybe silver bullets.",Hulk
355,marcyu,Not an Action Movie,4,18 September 2004,"This is not an action flick. You'll get about 20 minutes of it in this very long movie, but not much else. Ang Lee, the director of ""Sense and Sensibilities"" is not the right director for this movie. The seemingly endless usage of flashbacks, family mysteries, and misused starpower successfully drags this movie almost to a screeching halt. Lee did a much better job on ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". You're not supposed to look at your watch in an action movie, but I guarantee you'll be wishing it (a) to get to a good part or (b) the end to come. Unfortunately, you may feel like the latter comes before the former.As for you ""true believers"" out there, you really don't want to know how badly they hacked the origin of The Hulk.

It just couldn't seem to decide if it was going to be a drama or a Godzilla rip off. I wish they stuck to the drama, and I wish the creature wasn't SO cartoonish.  I understand what he was trying to do - which is to be true to the comic and the cartoon, but the story was so compelling before the Hulk was unbelievably (and I mean that in the true sense) bounding across the country that I wish the story would've stayed in the earth's atmosphere.  I got into the story and I was willing to suspend disbelief while the characters were developing, butit was almost as if the directory was slapping us and saying, ""come on, -IT'S A MOOOVIIIIEE, you idiot.  Watch, I'll make the damn thing be carried into space and live.  That should get you out of this 'this could really happen' mode.""Anyway, I still liked the movie.

I want a intriguing and involving story, and interesting characters that grow. Maybe my expectations were a bit high, and maybe I forgot how Ang Lee can confuse boredom for character development (anyone see Ride with the Devil?).I thought the last 1/3rd to 1/4th of the movie was pretty good, lots of revelations and an over the top feel that is true to the comic book style. I thought the bright, comic book colored motif and the frame and panel camera effects were some of the most original and entertaining elements of the movie. But most of the first half of the movie is extremely boring. Too much stale dialogue and too many random events that don't contribute to the story or character development.Overall I give it ** out of four stars...",Hulk
358,XFLRWF,Hulk Runs Wild!,8,3 July 2003,"Incredible!  The word synonymous with the legendary angry green giant known as the Hulk also describes the latest Marvel Comic theatrical release of the same name.  The infamous comic tells the story of Dr. Bruce Banner.  A brilliant scientist who when he loses his temper transforms into the property-destroying green colossus.  Following in the recent string of comic hits such as, ¡§Spider-Man¡¨ and ¡§X-Men¡¨, ¡§The Hulk¡¨ continues the trend with outstanding action sequences accompanied by a great script.
Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a scientist who studies the effects of gamma radiation UC Berkley.  All his life, Bruce has suppressed his emotions.  He does not become easily angered nor does he lash out at anyone.  He does, however, have horrible nightmares that leave him waking up in a cold sweat. His partner and ex-girlfriend, Betty Ross (Jennifer Connolly), is his constant supporter, helping him through his difficulties.  While repairing a gamma-emitting machine one day, Bruce¡¦s assistant accidentally activates the machine to go off.  Shielding his assistant, Banner takes the full force of the radiation.  Suddenly, Banner feels stronger and healthier than he¡¦s ever felt in his life.  But his new health comes with a terrible side effect.  When he becomes enraged, he transforms into the enormous, destructive Hulk.  Banner now struggles to subdue the beast within, a battle that the new night janitor (Nick Nolte) may hold the key to winning.
The marvelous partnership of director Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and screenwriters John Turman (Time Killer) and James Schamus (Ice Storm) give ¡§The Hulk¡¨ life unique from a typical comic book movie.  The masterful direction of Ang Lee is practically enough of a reason to see the film.  One of Lee¡¦s unique methods of storytelling in ¡§The Hulk¡¨ is his prodigious use of the split-level screen.  This allows the audience to view every possible angle in the scene and to further advance the story.  The split-level angles also give the film a more ¡§comic book¡¨ feel.  Just as there are multiple scenes illustrated in the graphic stories, they are also presented in ¡§Hulk.¡¨  Lee¡¦s direction does not limit patrons to simple one-dimensional point-of-view.  Rather, it allows the viewers the take in the whole picture. While some purists may argue with the film¡¦s version of the Hulk¡¦s origin, Turman and Schamus regardless present a very enjoyable story.  The writing duo does not simply pen a script about a man who turns into the beast when he becomes enraged.  Rather, they focus on the more underlying factors of Banner¡¦s anger.  Why has he suppressed his emotions?  How has it affected his life?  Will he ever be able to control it?  However, Turman and Schamus have not written a mere psychological evaluation.  The movie tells a good tale and is packed with stunning action sequences that comic fans have come to expect from Marvel.  Turman and Schamus bring the best of both sides to the screen.
Eric Bana sells the role Dr. Bruce Banner.  More concentrated on his work than anything else, he does not let relationship break-ups or other matters steer him off track.  Bana keeps his character¡¦s emotions in check.  While he may be angry at someone, he never lashes out at them.  While the film¡¦s Bruce Banner is perhaps a bit more brave than his comic book counterpart, Bana¡¦s portrayal of Banner is just right to the contrast of his angry alter ego.  Jennifer Connolly¡¦s Betty Ross is almost a scene-stealer of the movie.  As Betty, Connolly is the everlasting crutch for Bruce.  She is always there for him and is his calmer whenever he feels stressed.  It is Connolly who brings the emotion of the film.  Her faithfulness to Bruce and her desire to protect him from himself comes through in her performance for it is Betty who can still see the man behind the Hulk.  Audiences can feel her sincerity and grief as she struggles to help her ill-fated friend.  Nick Nolte delivers with the mystery and aura that emits from his character.  No one knows where the recluse janitor came from or what ulterior intentions he has planned at the institution.  Nolte¡¦s performance of the mystery man evokes both compassion and hatred.  Whereas one moment it may appear he is helping Banner with his research, the next scene he may appear to sabotage it.
¡§The Hulk¡¨ is a terrific movie and has all the elements to make it remembered for years to come.  Not only are there eye-pleasing effects but a good story, remarkable score, and superb directing accompany it.  Moviegoers and Hulk fans will appreciate Ang Lee¡¦s comic-like directing and the great performance by the cast.  ¡§The Hulk¡¨ is not to be missed in theatres for patrons will well receive their money¡¦s worth.  ¡§The Hulk¡¨ is simply: Incredible!

Why? After Daredevil, Blade, Elektra, Aeon Flux, League of extraordinary gentlemen, Spiderman (yes, i mean it), Spawn, etc etc there are many parallels you can draw between superhero films. And Hulk is the only thing that the others aren't: un-American! In a very rare exception we have a film here that doesn't have the arrogance and straight-forward story that we seem to have gotten used to too easily.Spiderman (in particular) follows the EXACT steps you can read in a tutorial for film making - that may be neat to watch but leaves no space for surprises or artistic inputs. Ang Lee seems to have taken especially this thought very seriously and created a piece of art that the average pop-corn-formula-film-liking movie-goer may find hard to digest.

At this point 80% of movie-consumers are out and 90% of movie-lovers come in (that number is small as we know).I appreciated the rather unconventional storytelling, I admire the cast, I treasure the artistic hybrid of comic and reality and I enjoyed the portrayal of energy. Now, anyone who has seen Asian action films will find many parallels - the question is, are YOU ready to adapt to some of those standards when they are being poured over a western story? I was... And I was overwhelmed!Anyone calling this movie the worst film they've ever seen (and there are quite few stating this) should stay with Spiderman, Transformers and Blade and get the same product over and over again (because they keep buying it). For my part I was grateful to see that there are people out there who get the chance to put a very distinctive stamp on their work making it unique and deep.Five years later the audience won and an assembly line version was released, not as bad as some others but definitely not as creative and visionary as this one.

360,DarkLugia1969,Hulkamania Running Wild!!!,8,21 June 2003,"-Note this comment may contain spoilers so you have been warned-Ang Lee is arguably the most versatile director for both the last century and for this century.  In his latest work entitled ""The Hulk"" is based loosely from a Robert Louis Stevenson novel entitled ""Doctor Jeckyl and Mister Hyde"".  Stan Lee and Jack Kirby then took that idea and brought the 1962 Marvel character to life.  In this Ang Lee rendition of ""the Hulk"", David Banner (Nick Nolte, ""48 Hours"") have been giving himself and his child, Bruce Banner secretly a serum that makes them nearly invincible.  As an adult Bruce (Eric Bana, ""Blackhawk Down"") saves one of his fellow scientists from harm but he is soon irradiated with gamma radiation.  When Bruce is provoked, he is transform to a large green behemoth that causes mass destruction.  His love interest Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly, ""A Beautiful Mind"") and her father General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (Sam Elliott) who have major impact for and against the creature dubbed ""the Hulk"".Ang Lee like most of his movies have a meaning that makes you think why people do things that they shouldn't do.  The meaning in this movie is that the children were being used, lied to and abandon by their fathers.  This definitely have a negative effect for the child.   As for the Hulk, Lee took this tortured creature and brought him feeling and life.  The only thing that I was disappointed in this great movie is that in the comics, the Hulk talks a lot but in the movie he only spoke two words.  Hopefully in the sequel that the Hulk talks more of either ""HULK SMASH"" or ""NOTHING CAN STOP THE HULK"".Overall, the Hulk was very impressive with the special effects as the creature destroys anything in his way.  The movie will be very successful for a sequel and if director Ang Lee has his way may be a nomination for next year's Oscar award.The Dark Gengar from one Gengar to Ten Gengars rates this INCREDIBLE MOVIE: Eight Gengars   The soundtrack was okay.

361,Lori_ruelo,The Green Giant is awakening!,6,20 August 2018,"As a little baby, the Offspring Bruce Banner Genmanipulativ is changed. Later, as a young man, he is a scientist himself and is employed with gamma radiation. He wants to try to reach scar tissue and injuries, using the radiations, a healing method. Through an accident with the radiation, banners mutate when he has a tantrum, to a Green Giant: the Hulk!
Eric Bana plays the shy and vulnerable Bruce banner. Although he does not really trust the role, he mastered the insecurity in person, sovereign. 
Jennifer Connelly plays Betty Ross. Connelly embodies Betty cool and sober. It is only when she experiences how banners mutate that she shares a helping emotion.
Josh Lucas plays Glen Talbot. Talbot is fully fixated on his career and is a smug Sesselfurzer. He wants to develop the invention of banners for the military and thus create super soldiers. He has every means right for that. Lucas was arranged as a little villain. Unfortunately, he doesn't necessarily come across like that.
The military commander Ross, is portrayed by Sam Elliott. Elliott plays his character cool and iron. He really wants to protect his country. That is why he acts defending and patriotic for his country. 
Although Nick Nolte has at least playtime, he plays his role most deeply. The few minutes of presence, is a pleasure of acting. 
The visual language of the director Ang Lee is very special. His idea of using certain settings as a split screen is also closer to the Marvel Comics. So that you really also realize the Hulk is a comic book template. 
The effects from the year 2003 are good, but you can already notice certain Unperfektheiten.
The animations are still kitschy. Which seems a bit ridiculous, too. The story leaves a lot to miss. On the one part, because Hulk belongs in the MCU, here the humor and sarcasm is very rare to see. The colourful and colourful MCU can not be classified here. The story is portrayed here rather as a fantasy drama. Which then looks rather dull for a comic book template. 
In the last third, it is right to the point and it is going to be quite an effect thunderstorm. It's really a pity that you have to wait more or less until the end until the Hulk drops off steam. 
Conclusion: A down-to-earth stand of the character hulk of Marvel Comics. Unfortunately, it diminishes the story through seriousness and dramaturgy that happens!",Hulk
362,sdillon-1,An unusually different summer blockbuster.,7,31 July 2003,"Certain critics have attacked Ang Lee's adaptation of the Incredible Hulk comics and quite rightly so.  After all, how dare an action-packed summer blockbuster contain plot and character depth, not to mention profound statements about anger and the relationships between fathers and their children.Ang Lee has never made a less than very good film and in my view, Hulk is no exception.  It is an extremely ambitious picture both visually and in terms of content.The basic story from the comics concerns scientist Bruce Banner, who is exposed to dangerous gamma radiation causing him to transform into a gigantic Hulk every time he gets angry.  The plot of the film however, goes considerably deeper, with Banner's abusive and possibly insane father being responsible for his son's unusual powers.  Add to this repressed childhood memories, a complex web of relationships between all the characters, and it makes for quite an intelligent film.  Of course it has the requisite action and explosions, but for once they seem to support rather than dominate the story.Eric Bana plays Bruce Banner and has clearly been cast because he doesn't look like a movie star.  This was a brave decision and works reasonably well in the film's favour.  Jennifer Connelly is quite good as the love interest. On the other hand, Nick Nolte as Banner's father is outstanding.  The direction from Lee is stunning, especially in his use of wipes and split screens, giving the constant impression you are watching a moving comic strip.  The special effects are excellent (if a little too bizarre at times) and Danny Elfman contributes his best music score in years.My main criticism is the film has virtually no humour.  If Steven Spielberg could invest a film as serious as Schindler's List with moments of comedy, then surely a few laughs wouldn't go amiss in the Hulk.  It takes itself far too seriously and adding comedy would have enabled the audience to suspend disbelief better, as well as enhancing the human drama.Despite this, I liked the film a great deal.  It's an unusually different summer blockbuster and deserves praise for that.  It also has an interestingly ambivalent attitude to anger.  On the one hand anger is shown as a great emotional release, enabling Banner to confront his repressed memories, and on the other it shows it to be destructive as the Hulk goes on his rampage.  If the film is ultimately judged a failure, then it's one of the most interesting failures of recent years.",Hulk
363,the_crock,Not incredible,3,3 August 2005,"From the terrible self important titles, to the really bad cameo from Stan Lee and the original Hulk, this movie is terribly obvious. And I don't say that lightly, because I think Ang Lee is a very talented filmmaker, but this is just nonsense. All the unnecessary transitions and CGI for no reason at all is almost a match for Eric Bana's uninspired performance. That terrible conversation between Eric and Jennifer is almost painful in the way only George Lucas dialogue can be.Maybe it's the constant fighting that this movie is having within itself, trying to be true to the comic book, while trying to show the deepness of Bruce Banner, but really it does neither. Whether it's the redicoulesness of trying to make this story into something similar to the recent Batman movie, rather than a more hellboyesque movie that this should have been. This is a comic book story nothing more, and unfortunately there is no need to make it seem credible, just have some fun with it and let the green guy break some stuff.Then when the big green bloke does finally start to break stuff, there is so much CGI that it's like watching a cartoon. All credibility that this movie had tried to build up, through Bruce's flash backs and the General crazy scientist angle is lost when we see a 4 minute scene where the green cartoon character is jumping across the desert.Ang Lee lost the plot while making this movie, why try and make the inner struggle so important if your going to back it up with a cartoon character bouncing around like a clown.

As is so often the case it seems to me to be mainly caused by false expectations. I am a big fan of the original comic book and I though this was a wonderful treatment of the story. I imagine the younger audience this was likely to appeal to just didn't have the patience to give the film time for the pay off. But when the action gets going it is very well done. Ang Lee deserves praise for tackling such a fantastic story with so much humanity and attention to detail.The other positive reviews here have said pretty much all the same things I would so I will spare everyone the repetition. Suffice it to say I thought the film had great action, excellent drama, good script and acting and was very true to the feeling of the original comic book.The saddest thing is that the kind of negative reaction this film got will just continue to dumb down the industry and make some of the best film makers think twice before they consider trying to tackle fantastic subjects in a serious way.",Hulk
365,Y-Sly,Incredible,8,18 June 2003,"Yes.. it is! This movie is a lot better than I expected. This is not an ordinary action movie, this is a great comic book adaptation (like X-Men 1-2, Spider-Man, DareDevil, Batman 1-2, Superman 1-2). I liked the romance between Betty and Bruce, the father-son 'affair' and everything: the script, the CGI, the music, the cast and really everything. Enjoy this movie! 9.5/10",Hulk
366,kornkicksass_69,Not just a bis ass green guy,8,25 November 2003,When I saw this movie with my friend my expectations were very low. After seeing it I think it is one of the best super hero movies. When you see commercials you think it is a computer generated shrek with muscles in purple pants. But when you see it it has a steady storyline and is very interesting. I think people (including myself) judged this too quickly. So next time you watch a movie trailer watch it before you start to trash it.,Hulk
367,Vinny-28,1-1/2 STAR DISASTER,1,20 June 2003,"This is the worst Marvel Comics film adaptation thus far.  The character of Bruce Banner is now a creation of his deranged father, and was basically a monster when he was born.  This destroys the entire concept of the character.  Eric Bana is a total bore in a badly-written role.  Is there any reason to give a darn about Banner with this new origin?  Any compelling reason to follow him in a sequel?  No.  The much-talked-about split screens add nothing to the film since there is nothing even remotely complex enough going on to take advantage of split-screen techniques, and become tiresome after the first few minutes.  The Hulk looks ridiculous not because he looks fake--so did King Kong--no, he looks ridiculous because his face looks like a fat pouting version of Eric Bana.  Hulk fighting three Hulk dogs?  Hulk fighting his crazy father who inexplicably turns into a confusing version of the Absorbing Man, finally becoming some kind of energy cloud?  What the heck is this film, anyway?  Who in the heck decided to make a film called ""The Hulk"" and then create something that includes both a goofy green monster jumping around the desert AND a flashback with a crazed father stabbing a mother as the young boy looks on?  Just who did they think they were making this film for?  The answer is...no one.  It's a total bore with embarrassingly bad dialogue, no plot to speak of, flat performances, a couple of fun Hulk moments that are over way too soon, and a totally ludicrous third act supervillain.  Hey guys, this was supposed to be a superhero monster movie, not a bogus repressed-memories melodrama.  Ang Lee was the wrong director for this material, but the real culprit is the producer and writer.  Shame on you, Schamus.",Hulk
368,josephtheowl,The Incredibly Mediocre Hulk,1,12 December 2006,"As a comics fan I'm embarrassed I took 3 of my friends to see this movie. It's made me more skeptical of the credibility of the superhero genre. The Hulk is supposed to represent a real dark, repressed part of the human psyche, the inner conflict within a man's mind made real. Instead, his motivation is reduced to ""daddy issues"" like so many teen adolescent dramas out there.Except that Bruce Banner is a grown man.Eric Bana, (who played an elite soldier in ""Black Hawk Down"", mind you) plays Bruce Banner, even though he doesn't resemble the nerdy, bookish scientist Banner in the least. Bana monotonously voices each line and doesn't seem to resent at all the Hulk persona, who isn't seen until a good 40 minutes into the 138 minute movie.Just the way it was shot, the way scenes were put side by side with one another was awkward, and the explosion at the military complex scene with Josh Lucas' character 'Talbot' after he tries to extract a sample from the Hulk was farcical. Anytime the Hulk created vast amounts of destruction, nobody died. He tosses a guy through a window, guy doesn't die. He threw a tank and destroyed it, no one died (the army guys even report no casualties right after). He catches and throws a missile at a helicopter, sending it crashing down into a rocky canyon, nobody dies. I'm surprised Banner's dad David (Nick Nolte) and goldfish Goldie didn't bust out of their watery grave at the end. It's that ridiculous and laughable after a while.The movie did more to hurt future comic book franchises than help. Ang Lee is usually a talented director, but this kind of film really isn't his niche. It's like having Michael Bay directing Schindler's List. Like everything in this movie, including Hulk's pants, it shouldn't and doesn't fit.",Hulk
369,colinjbooth,Perfect comic book movie,8,22 July 2004,"what i expected of 'the hulk', ang lees somewhat spiritual take on the stan lee legend, was a talky id-driven angst superhero flick. what i found, however, was that Lee (ang) had crafted a movie which carries a technically superb dissection of what a real comic book would be like in film form. Hence split screens, wipes and stylish fades straight out of Marvel #248. Sure i'll admit it is quite a slow starter but the last hour is feckin kick ass entertainment.I would recommend this film to any comic book film fans, and i even told my dad he should watch it. It's more substantial than X2, grounded in a science which spidey and Blade could only dream about, and has a 15 foot behemoth throwing tanks 10 miles!",Hulk
370,giantdevilfish,"Great Effects, but dull story",10,15 November 2003,"First off the Hulk had incredible effects. The Hulk looked ultra realistic, especially in closeups, and was faithful to the comics (they even kept the trademark PURPLE PANTS!!!). While there are a couple of cartoonish effects, for the most part the effects were truly amazing. The standout scene was the Hulk's viscous fight with the mutated dogs, hands down the best part of the movie. The Hulk taking on the military in the desert was a classic scene straight out of the comics. The only complaints I have is, why does the Hulk grow when he gets mad? In some scenes he's standing almost 20 feet tall! That made the Hulk look like a giant green version of King Kong. He's only supposed to be about 7-8 feet tall! The madder he gets the stronger he gets NOT the bigger he gets! The fight with his father (The Absorbing Man) had potential but came off as disappointing (especially the water fight). Also it would have been cool if the Hulk spoke. ""Hulk Smash!"" ""Leave Hulk Alone!"" etc. My beef with the film though, is the complex story which dragged on in most parts and didn't make a whole lot of sense in other parts. Ang Lee tried to turn this movie into an dark art film which almost ruined it and turned off a lot of the mainstream audience. He would have been better off treating this as an action style movie like the other comic films out there, as opposed to a melodrama . Still overall, it was a pretty good flick (alot better then most people will give it credit for), and hopefully we'll see a sequel.",Hulk

372,RockytheBear,Call it Angry Shrek...,2,8 July 2003,"ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.
First, they made Coleco-Vision.  Then they made Turbo Grafix.  But now the makers of PlayStation 2 bring you The Hulk, or as I like to call it, ""Angry Shrek.""  Of course, this is sarcasm, I don't know what animation team created The Hulk, but whoever they are, they should be fired.  I don't mean fired from their jobs, I mean fired by a firing squad.  They were right to drop the ""Incredible"" from the title, because this Hulk is anything but. This big green guy was about as menacing as Sprout from the Green Giant ads. Drop Dead Fred was scarier than this animated feature passing as good CGI.Good CGI is Starship Troopers.  Bad CGI is The Hulk.  Good action is Speed. Bad action is The Hulk.  Challenging foes are the dinosaurs King Kong faced. Bad foes are the gamma ray infected dogs The Hulk faced.  Dogs?  Dogs?? This scene wasn't even funny accidentally.  I couldn't believe what I was witnessing.  That movie Congo must now pass its torch-- we finally have animals that look more fake and are even less scary.  And that ""puny human"" scene...let's talk about that.  No wait, we'll get to that later.I should have known the movie was in trouble when I realized the star was some guy nobody ever heard of named Eric Bana.  But I gave the film the benefit of the doubt because after all, Christopher Reeve and Mark Hamill were both unknowns when their blockbusters came out (and ironically, they both still are.)  But this movie started bad and got worse.  The first 10 minutes move at a crappy lightning pace, and the comic book directing style gets old and annoying very quickly.  Watching the movie was like sliding down a razor blade nude...and to cool off, landing in an alcohol river.Nick Nolte plays a (mad) scientist and father of Bruce Banner.  Nolte has experimented with his DNA against lab policy, and he is banished.  He then goes nuts and does something to his wife that isn't shown, and we don't care.  Jennifer Connelly plays Betty Ross, a fellow scientist and colleague of Bruce's.  Take a guess if a love affair between them ensues.To make a long story short, which this movie is firmly against, Bruce gets infected with gamma rays and that causes him to become a big Hulk whenever he gets mad.  But that's hardly the problem with this movie.  The problem is the fact that Kangaroo Jack looks more real than The Hulk.  And how about that ""puny human"" scene?  Oh, God.  Bruce has a dream that the Hulk grabs him by the throat and says ""PUNY HUMAN.""  It is easily the worst scene of the film.  Even worse than the scene where The Hulk, or as I like to say, Angry Shrek, fights off more animated dogs in a never ending scene.Another never ending scene is the climax, or as I like to say, Bouncing Banner.  The Hulk bounces like a Superball for the last 45 minutes of the movie and it isn't even in a city.  It's in a desert.  At least a city would make it more exciting, but The Hulk bounces for 45 minutes throughout a non-scenic desert and it wears thin very quickly.  Then the military comes and tries to destroy the Hulk, Nick Nolte is captured as well and becomes some strange electro-super monster that isn't even explained.  He then fights The Hulk in a final duel and of course, the Hulk wins.  After all, we need a sequel.  Bruce then ends up in Columbia somewhere speaking Spanish and then says in espanol the famous Bill Bixby quote, ""You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.""  And if you don't wish to know the ending of the movie, don't read anything I just wrote.Sam Elliot is also in the movie, as a General and father of Betty Ross. But he trimmed down his push-broom, so you hardly recognize him.  Ang Lee, helloooo.  I only like my Sam Elliot in hillbilly mode, thank you very much. And Lou Ferrigno has a ""don't blink or you'll miss him"" cameo and in that small scene alone, he is ten times more frightening than the actual Hulk. Sure, they gave him a security uniform 4 sizes too small, but he looks like if he punched you, you'd be seeing pink hearts, yellow moons, orange clovers, and green diamonds.  At just the sight of him, I felt like such a puny human.  God in heaven, what a bad movie.Zero out of 5.",Hulk
373,sweetnlowdown2,"The Best Comic Book Movie Of Late, But, That's Not Saying Much",3,30 June 2003,"One of the problems I have with Hollywood making comic book movies every month is that none of them are good. I've noticed that all of these comic book movies being made are just for the fans. None of these movies have strong enough character development. They are all campy. A movie like ""Spider-Man"" did try to make us believe what we saw, but I felt that the casting was wrong. ""X-Men"" movies are strickly for the fans. So if you know little to nothing about it don't even bother. It's a mess of a film. And then ""Hulk"" came out. I admit I thought it was going to be junk. And I couldn't for the life of me believe that Ang Lee was going to direct it. He has such talent. Movies like ""The Ice Storm"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" are masterpieces of modern day cinema so why would he waste of talents here? I read good reviews for this film. The critics stated that the movie was unlike previous lame brain comic book movies and this one had depth to it. That Ang Lee was interested in telling a story and not so concerned with action scenes. This all sounded like a good idea to me. I thought just maybe I might enjoy this movie. But, alas it's not a very good movie. One of the first problems with the movie is it takes too long with it's set-up. Most people, even those unfamiliar with ""The Hulk"" comic books I think understand the character. You don't have to read a ""Superman"" comic to know who he is, do you? So there is fault one. We all pretty much know the basic premise of this movie already and the movie drags before it starts to make it's point. Flaw number two, ""Hulk"" wants us to take it serious and yet at the same time it's campy. The line ""Your making me angry. You won't like me when I'm angry."" sounds like something out of a second rate ""b"" movie. The final scenes involving the big fight is just well...lame. I mean think about it for a second. Just think about what Nolte is doing. The man turns into water!!!!!!! Another problem I had was that somewhere along the way Ang Lee got confused and though that the ""Hulk"" was ""Superman"" or ""Spider-Man"" because all of a sudden it seems like ""Hulk"" can fly. When he jumps he's flying almost. Lets be logical for a second. If a 15 ft 1,000 pound ""thing"" was to jump, would he A) fly away or B) Create a hole in the ground and maybe even get stuck? You chose. If I were to grade you, I would hope you all said B. Also a conversation between Connelly and Elliot it states takes place one year after the events when infact the way they are talking you would believe only a day, week, or a month has passed. There are some good things to say about this movie. It is the best comic book movie to come out. It's better than ""Spider-Man"", ""Daredevil"", ""X-Men"" and it's sequel. Ang Lee does TRY to create something more but, I just feel he was the wrong choice to direct this piece. Maybe somebody like John Woo. There's an idea huh? ""Hulk"" could of been a good movie. All comic book movies haven't attempted to create the atmosphere this movie does. All they allowed on was the audience already being familiar with the characters and just having lots and lots of fight scenes but never given the movie any depth. Here with the ""Hulk"" they tried to give the movie depth but forgot to make it exciting. The movie does offer hope. I honestly thought you couldn't make a good movie out of a comic book. But here with this movie maybe one day it could be done. Someone just has to find out how to blend the depth and the action together in a way that won't single the other out but yet balance the two out evenly so we are getting the best of both worlds. I feel it can be done now. We will just have to wait and see. ""Hulk"" gets ** out of **** or on a scale of 1 - 10 I give it a 3. p.s. Look out for a cameo from Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno (the original ""Hulk"" from the old tv show)",Hulk
374,knightsend2k1,What a complete train wreck.,5,10 January 2004,"What happened here ? I'll tell you what happened here : Ang Lee.Action Fans do not want some artsy fartsy rendition of Pop Americana.Ang Lee would be fine if you want something in the likes of The Ice Storm,but for Hulk he just sucks.Most of the people I have talked to that have seen this have the same problems,and are as follows : # 1 - Hulk Dogs.Hulk Dogs ??? Okay I can live with that......but a Poodle ? What genius thought of that idea ? # 2 - Bruce Banner's Dad was a sick, twisted,murdering individual....not a sick,twisted,murdering super villain.Who's brilliant idea was THAT one I wonder ? # 3 - Transitions every few seconds for no apparent reason.Hey Ang,you're making a movie about a comic,not a movie INTO a comic ! Boy did those grate on my nerves.... # 4 - The apparent lack of any coherent direction.Someone tell me exactly where the direction was in this picture ??? This movie presented itself as a collage of unfinished ideas slapped together with all the precision of a first year film student.Horrible. # 5 - The ending.The worst ending I have ever seen in a superhero movie aside from the inept low budget Captain America from the nineties.Can you say anti-climatic ??? How about boring ? # 6 - The pacing.Before we even see the Hulk the story moves along at a snails pace.I almost fell asleep.Alright,now that I've said what drove me absolutely batty about the trainwreck called "" Hulk "" let me say what was done correctly.Unlike alot of other people I had no problem with the way The Hulk looked.I think that he was probably the most realistic character this side of Golem in any CGI movie ever made.What was he doing stuck in such a boring movie like this ? I also liked the character of General Ross.Nice performance there Sam.Great as usual.That's what was so sad about this movie as a whole : it had great actors, but it lacked any coherent direction or intriguing story.Someone should have told Avi Arad that you need to find a good writer and director as well......Truth be told I hope there is a sequel.Why ? Maybe they'll get it right the second time around.As it stands now,the t.v. show with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno was a whole lot better.My favorite comic character flushed down hollywood's toilet.What a waste. I hated Ang Lee's other movies,including the goofy Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.I guess this makes it official,I hate all his movies,and Ang,you couldnt direct your way out of a wet paper sack.How about you retire and leave The Hulk franchise alone ? Batman had Joel Schumacher,but at least that was three movies in ! Thanks for destroying what could have been a great franchise.",Hulk
375,VenomX,"Hulk hurt by studio, Hulk mad!",7,2 September 2003,"The Hulk was both a giant on the screen and in the media, hyped up beyond belief during the 2-3 weeks prior to release.  One could not escape from The Hulk's fury.  Now, granted I was excited about Hulk but I preferred to let my own expectations guide myself into the theatre and not some magazine cover so I didn't let the hype get to me.  I enjoyed watching the teaser and year prior and the Superbowl adbut that was about it, (I like to get a small taste to get my mind going).  But I felt the hype went overboard, granted it wasn't as bad as Godzilla's was, (then again, Godzilla was much worse that Hulk was) but it does suffer from the same problem: hype killed the monster.Hulk suffers from two problems: pacing and style of direction with both mutating and causing mayhem much like the Hulk does.  I have nothing against Ang Lee and respect him as a director but his style just doesn't work with this film.  The multiple screen view, (where there are multiple frames on the screen each showing the same scene at different angles) works for shows like 24 but not on the big screen.  The comic book drawings and designs are not need and just look ridiculous, (Bruce Banner turning into a cartoon when hit by gamma rays? Come on!).  As for the pacing problems, I think there needed to be a good blend of action and plot without cramming it all into one section.  The 90-minute plot at the beginning is a real drag for what Universal expected to be a summer film, while the 45 minutes of action at the end was rewarding but too shortthen there's the ending which really came out of nowhere.  Basically what I am trying to say is that this was supposed to be a summer film, judging from what the studio hyped yet it clearly was not that.But Hulk is not all bad; I walked out of the theatre feeling my money was well spent.  The CGI was mighty impressive, (regardless of what anyone thinks) and really showed the green guy well.  The acting was up to par while the action was mind-blowing, (I still like seeing Hulk smashing up those tanks in the desert, doesn't get old).  But the pacing again was the real problem as I felt the action should have been more present with the plot doing it's job of holding the film together while not being an artificial brace.So, why did Hulk turn back into a disappointing summer movie after being an unstoppable monster?  Hulk is such a great concept; it has the character development and the action to make a great film.  Hype and a flawed direction ruined its chances to become the next X-Men and provide another franchise to the superhero genre.  Even though Hulk was riddled with flaws it provided an entertaining two hours, which I felt, were well spent.6.5/10",Hulk
376,cwf97,The Patriarch Of Intense Comic Book Films,10,25 August 2017,"Many people believed that Batman Begins started all of the intense comic book films but Hulk actually started it all without letting people know firsthand.Ang Lee and James Schamus did a very original and creative interpretation of the iconic Marvel monster while making him much more tragic and relatable at the same time compared to the Marvel Cinematic Universe interpretation. The film is very similar to a Greek tragedy and somewhat inspired Logan due to the gritty and pessimistic feel.The acting from Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Sam Elliott, Josh Lucas and Nick Nolte were top notch as well as Schamus' writing and Tim Squyres' editing that is very unorthodox compared to quintessential film editing. It made it look like an actual comic book film.Hulk is a hidden emerald and should be understood better for being more bright.",Hulk
377,Chicky5150,An Unjustly Maligned Movie - Mild Spoilers I Suppose,9,28 December 2005,"Ang Lee takes a simple idea and tries to reinvent it and mostly succeeds. Sadly, most people are familiar with the seventies television show where a scientist turned into a hulking bodybuilder with a green wig whenever he got mad, something that would have been laughed off of the screen.Instead this is about a driven scientist who experiments on his own son, a son with a repressed memory. After an accident with radiation, whenever he starts to remember this incident he turns into a massive computer generated giant. He'll need his new abilities to fight the return of his father - and the entire military.The attacks against this movie are laughable, mostly because people haven't considered the other options. The Hulk doesn't appear for a while. In most great movies, the pivotal character doesn't appear early, Jaws being the best example of that. The character is computer generated. A man in a wig would have been laughed out of theaters, so it was computer generated. Yeah, it looked fake, since there are no fifteen foot tall green men around. Let it go. Yeah, every time he gets mad, he doesn't turn into the Hulk. That was cool for the television show, but for a two + plus hour movie, that would have been stupid. Basically, every time he was in a traffic jam, out of decaf coffee, or dropped his pen, he would turn into the Hulk. This is a cool movie that requires some patience. Yeah, its a little overwrought, but an ambitious film that misses excellence is still pretty good.",Hulk
378,tlawrenceintel,One of The Best Superhero Movies,10,29 September 2018,"Definitely not a superhero movie even though it is about a character grouped with the superhero multiverse. Ang Lee created a moody drama about one mans struggle with an uncontrollable prevail that is passionately drawn and poignantly years ahead of its time. Released at the same time as the Spiderman trilogy it set the tone for the Christopher Nolan helmed Batman trilogy that followed. Its a shame that it was overshadowed by the reboot that followed because it is by far the better movie. I am a huge Edward Norton fan but I believe that Eric Bana was far better as the troubled Bruce Banner. All of the supporting cast were excellent in their roles, especially The Moustasche who played the typical protagonist. Nick Bolts was excellent as the demented mad scientist father who was guilty of poisoning his and his sons DNA. But...as I mentioned earlier...Ang Lee was the real star here. An almost realized masterpiece. Is it me or is the phallic shaped rock formation intentionally placed?",Hulk
379,omouallem,All the Hulk had to do...,3,2 November 2003,"...was smoke a joint.  Seriously, Mr. Banner, Mr. Bruce Banner and his hundreds of antagonists, instead of forcing this monster to undergo so much stress related tests and anxiety -- what you should have done was roll him a joint and smoke it.  Hell, Mr. Ross, Betty, the Hulk's Father should smoke one too.  I wish Ang Lee smoked one, then maybe he would have sat down, chilled, and thought this one out before he signed on the dotted line.  The many screenwriters on this project (doesn't surprise me that there were so many, money-gobbling films like this tend to undergo as many rewrites as physically possible until one draft contains enough dialogue and irrelevant action to make you cringe) -- well the writers probably smoked a whole once every morning before they pulled up a seat to their PC's.  That would explain the reluctance to focus on one topic.Look, of all the Comic books movies out right now, this one is the most stylized.  But style does not make this worth seeing.  Nor does its great cast.  It suffers from a lack of integrity.  It condescends to its audience by repeating facts over and over again, it disguises back story as essential to understanding this opus.  Too many damn antagonists for one (or two) protagonists, and with an inciting incident that comes 30 minutes in, you wonder why it was so necessary to take two-and-a-quarter hours to explain the story.  Not too mention the fact that the excess use of flashbacks will have your eyes rolling so far back, you're going to see white.The last twenty-minutes are so laughable, so inconveniently placed to set up a sequel, you will wonder -- why not use that footage as part of the sequel. But that would probably make the next Hulk 3 hours long, and god forbid they ever do that to the public.  145 minutes as long enough.This film had potential, as do all the comic book films of this year (excluding LXG).  I mean look at X-Men (and X-2) they are great simply because they merge great story with great storytelling.Save yourself some time, some money, some dignity.",Hulk

382,lochnessmummy,Know that it is long; understand that it is great.,7,19 July 2003,"The best thing that happened before I saw Ang Lee's Hulk, was being warned how long it was.  I was prepared for a film that would run slowly in parts, but took its time exploring its characters.  As such, this film was one of the best of the year.Lee created a very moving and emotional telling of the seminal comic book hero, and does so with a wonderfully innovative use of split-screen technology, which is normally a turn-off.  It reminded me of what Dennis Hopper was trying to do with his flashing segeways in Easy Rider.  But where Hopper failed, Lee perfects.  It is not recommended that anyone try split-screen, ever.  But if someone does try, they must use this film as a reference.The cinematography and performances are stellar, especially Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, and Nick Nolte.  The film is far from perfect, however. The dependable Sam Shepard is an annoying ham here, and the script does sometimes push our suspension of disbelief too far.  Such is the consequense of filming the story of a monster, who only manifests when some convenient character can make him mad.Anyone who judges this film badly because the computer generated Hulk looks synthetic, ought to stay away from this genre of films altogether.",Hulk
383,kmthomas-1,Almost A Classic,7,21 June 2003,"After SpiderMan and Xmen2, I was expecting very little from Hulk.  While the aforementioned movies were entertaining enough, they pale in comparison to Ang Lee's Hulk.  I thought the CGI in the commercials looked cartoony, at best, and wretched, at worst.  However, once you are drawn into the movie, the CGI becomes brilliant,at times; it's acceptable, at others.  It's nowhere near as expressive as Gollum from LOTR:The 2 Towers, but the musculature (and hard work it takes to make that believable) serves its purpose.  Bottom line: the CGI doesn't detract from the story, but boosts it at the appropriate times: and that's the most one can expect at this stage from CGI characters.  The acting is on the mark, with Bana very convincing as Bruce Banner.  Nolte and Connely deliver in their roles equally well. The direction, however, is a little mixed.  At times, the segues and fades that Lee chose in this movie were awesome.  However, the oddly spaced moments of turning the screen into a comic page were not only irritating, they snapped you away from the movie itself.  The 'comic pages' only remind you that this is based on a comic, and therefore, shouldn't be taken seriously.  This would seem to be the exact opposite of what you'd want to achieve.  The music by Danny Elfman is nonexistent, at best, and merely more of his usual drivel.  He evidently blew his wad on Batman.  Aside from the odd direction, this could've been a classic comic adaptation, almost up to Superman and Batman levels.  On a 4-star scale, it gets 2.5 stars.  As it was, the odd 'comic screens' and poor music hold it back.",Hulk

He has perfectly captured the essence of the Hulk in this movie. It has all of the humanity and tragedy of the hulk with no filler.  I was amazed at the camera work in the movie, which appears just as a comic book would read.  I thought the acting was great for a comic book movie (because it's a comic book-based movie I know that the acting is expected to be at times cheesy); but the acting here was really, really good.  The best actor of the bunch was Sam Elliot who pulled of General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross almost to perfection.  Josh Lucas, who played Major Talbot was a bit of a sissy at times, but Talbot always was a conniving sissy.  I also thought Betty and Bruce Banner were portrayed very well, by Jennifer Connelly and Eric Bana, respectively.  The special effects are what got me the most.  While a lot of people are upset at the effects and say that the Hulk looks too fake and cartoony for this movie to be taken seriously, I loved it.  While the Hulk DOES look a little like a cartoon at times, I believe that this is the best look for him.  I loved Lou Ferrigno as the Hulk, but there's only so much that flesh and blood can do.  With CGI there are no limits.  There's so much more that I can say about this movie, but I don't know where to begin.  The movie was PERFECT in every way.  This is by far the BEST comic book-based movie.  I feel that the origin of the Hulk should have been with the Gamma Bomb (Rick Jones could have been in the movie as well) I feel that the alteration in the movie with the nanomeds and gamma technology was a good move.  I'll agree that the ""Hulk Dogs"" were kinda corny, but it shows the insanity that David Banner has achieved throughout the years.  Nick Nolte was great as the villian, and his energy absorption/fusion powers were really cool.  I HIGHLY recommend this movie to everybody.  I give it a 5/5. In fact, I bought this movie BEFORE I saw it!!!!!",Hulk
386,ArArArchStanton,"It's introspective, and that's a good thing!!!",8,17 November 2005,"There are 2 major reasons to love marvel movies. The action, and the characters. X-men is huge because it's about how these people deal with power, and how power can also be a negative thing. It reminds me of the principle of anne rice novels, where she explores how the idea of living forever might not be that great in the long run. Hulk has this kind of introspection. It builds up the backstory better of the character better than any other filmed comic hero. the lower rating stems from the fact that it is not wall to wall action, but quite frankly the action, when it comes, is great. The final fight seen is jaw dropping as is the lead in to it. In short, this movie is perfect, don't let anybody tell you different.",Hulk
387,hydrocilator,"Unengaging, then fun",7,31 October 2003,"We don't see the Hulk in action until about 1/2 way through the flick. The science & drama leading up to this takes too long.  I nearly lost interest before the hulk arrived because all the drama failed to make me feel empathy for the characters.HOWEVER, the movie is really fun to watch after the Hulk arrives.  He is the dirtiest, scrappiest fighter in recent memory.  It was fun enough to make me want to ignore CGI, plot, & other problems that caught my eye.",Hulk

389,sackleywhistle,"Stylish, exciting, touching, but not for everyone",9,13 August 2003,"Being a big fan of the old Lou Ferrigno TV series and having seen the trailers, as well as being a long-time fan of Ang Lee, my hopes were sky high for this one to be my film of the summer, maybe the year. Well, it wasn't, but that doesn't mean it was a wash-out. It just wasn't the film that we had been promised by the trailers. That's probably because this is a hard-sell from the film that Lee delivered.If you want mad, rampaging Hulk action, its there - in spades - for the best part of an hour. Its beautifully shot, well-designed and exciting, not to mention highly amusing. Watching ""Hulk Smash"" those tanks is pure geek nirvana, displaying a helluva lot of character at the same time. However, either side is a lot of exposition, with a good 45 mins or so of setup before the Hulk is unleashed. Suffice to say, when he is, it's glorious.But there is alot more going on here. Ang Lee's films are about repression. Here it is about a child so scared of letting his rage get the better of him that he has grown into a man unable to express almost any emotions because he's hidden from them for so long. As such, he doesn't know his dad and is unable to tell Betty (the never-more-luminescent or effective Jennifer Connelly) how he feels for her.When his father (the always great Nick Nolte) turns up after years in the wilderness, his rage begins to re-emerge. That's when the action kicks in. There are surreal asides throughout - the Hulk dog fight is a joy, but weird. Nolte's developing strengths are touched upon before being explored more towards the end and, because it comes as such a surprise, can seem like an afterthought and a bizarre one at that.The final twenty minutes or so, while in many ways the perfect wrapping up of all the issues Lee raises, are both surprising and confusing. Perhaps an extra five or ten minutes in the climactic scenes might have given a bit more weight to a slightly soggy ending to what is largely a thrilling film.On the plus side, the editing - while slightly over the top - is at times very subtle in its handling of several subjects at once and this is the closest to comic book framing that there has been. It really does feel and move like a comic book. The cinematography, though a little dark in some scenes at night, is gorgeous, particularly when we are in the military base or out on the mesas. The scoring is fine, the acting excellent from the four leads - Bana is well-cast as Banner, Connelly continues to extend her range and grow in beauty, Nolte is gruff (of course) and believable as a bit of a nutjob and Sam Elliot does what he does best, while sharing a few more personal scenes with Connelly. The only false step is Josh Lucas who doesn't have much to work with, but he gets his in due course...Finally, the much-debated effects. In the early Hulk scenes, he is difficult to see and it feels as though they may be hiding what they couldn't muster. But once he lets rip in the daylight, i stopped looking for the joins and just went with it. He looks a bit goofy at points, but then he's a several ton green giant in purple shorts, so what did you expect? I loved him and he looked like the Hulk to me. His roll down the dunes is flawless fx work in my book, as is his transformation into Banner in San Francisco.Its not the best film Lee has made (a toss-up between Crouching Tiger and The Ice Storm), nor the best comic book movie (X2?), but it is something different in a summer of sequels and knock-offs. Well worth a watch, but go in with an open mind and you will find it all the more rewarding.Sackley",Hulk
390,Brian_E_Watters,"Love It, But Second One Is Better",7,21 October 2009,"Yes, I do like this movie quite a bit. It's a good comic book movie. There's really nothing especially wrong with it, but I think it pales in comparison to a lot of the other big comic book movies made around the same time.Also, some of the special effects in this movie just aren't as good as I would like. If you watch it, you'll know what I mean.I don't fully understand why a second Hulk movie was made fairly soon after this one. The stories are totally unrelated. Regardless, the second recent Hulk movie (in 2008) is much better than this Hulk movie. If you have to pick one, see the second one, since the two movies seem to be totally independent of each other. Or, like me, see them both.",Hulk
391,GTDMAC,Hulk Smashes!,10,23 June 2003,"Where to begin?  Just saw the redeye at the megaplex last night and I have to say after reading all the reviews that all of them are right to one degree or another.  The Hulk is a very ambitious film and the atmosphere created to host that ambition is flawed.  Still, it manages to be more of a believable story given you understand that Eric Bana really is SCARED to death to be playing the role of Bruce Banner, a man who is perpetually scared to death.  So I disagree that he did a bad job.  In fact, he did it right since Bruce IS a cold fish who doesn't let anyone get close if he can help it because of his terror.  Also people should remember that Bruce takes a long time AFTER he starts turning into the Hulk to unwind and become a real person.  Before that he is an introverted genius who is so self absorbed that a cure is all he cares about.  Before he realizes that the Hulk actually can do some good in the world, that is.  Then he loosens up and begins to actually think he might manage to make a difference.  This is shown in the last scene in the movie and with a tip of the hat to Bill Bixby as well. 
The special effects are great if you are a microbiologist or geneticist. To the layman and the kids a lot of the more vivid scenes are merely swirls of color unless you can tell mitochondria from whole cells at a glance and are familiar with species of desert lichen.  The figure of the Hulk himself is as perfect a comic book CGI adaptation as there has ever been.  Ok, so there are some minor texture and coordination issues.  Still it gives us a view of the Hulk we wish we'd seen on television years ago.  What is being shown here that doesn't quite get through is that the Hulk is ultimately a product of the environment and thus, yet another part of nature.  Ang Lee attempts to give us a broader picture, a wider angle on the drama that is life and still retain his signature look and feel to the film.    I feel it succeeded but only if you know what to look for.  Otherwise, I could see kids being put to sleep by it before being shocked awake by screeching metal and loud explosions.  Which is kind of like reading a Hulk comic book...Yes, I agree with those who say this movie has flaws and yes, I agree that this film captures the essence of The Hulk beautifully as no other visual media has ever before.  One has to remember that, when one sees his powerful legs propel him from a building top that, by rights, should have been crushed or, at least damaged, if he did anything more than tiptoe lightly, there is a real need for a willing suspension of dibelief here.  This reminds us that this is inspired by a comic book and yet, because of the purpose and the focus, manages to transcend the genre.  You aren't seeing the ""older but wiser"" Hulk of today's comics.  You are seeing the beginning of his development.  I honestly think this movie will inspire sequels but that they won't have the same inner purpose this does.  Ang Lee and The Hulk show us the beauty of being green and free and maybe that's the way we secretly all want to be ...",Hulk
392,jmuntmootcourt,"Achieved their goals, but that wasn't enough",4,7 January 2008,"Though I was thoroughly disappointed in this movie, Ang Lee and company did accomplish what they set out to do. Instead of a film adaptation of a comic book, they tried to make an actual comic book on screen. The editing, cinematography, etc. were very cool in that sense, because it was quite literally like watching a live-action comic book.That is about all that I found interesting. The acting, delivered by some very talented folks, was very flat and unconvincing. The plot and villains were uninteresting. The CGI, though well done, was just so sensationalized that it seemed ridiculous. It's worth watching, but definitely isn't on my ""must-have"" DVD list. Catch it on TV if you can, as Sci-Fi runs it once in a while. Let's hope that the new one turns out as a better overall movie, even if it's not as artistically unique as this was.",Hulk

Hulk would have to be my least favorite superhero films ever. I haven't watched The Incredible Hulk (you know, that other Hulk movie?) for a while but from what I remember of that film, it was one hundred times better than this garbage. In writing this review, I understand the CGI wasn't as good as nowadays but even still, it was better than what was served in this. If you don't believe me, watch a movie made from this time such as Spiderman, Lord of the Rings or Star Wars and you'll know what I mean. As mentioned in the above sentence, the special effects seem outdated, even for a 2003 movie, editing was mashed together rather sloppy like something out of a B-grade television show, acting was beyond wooden and I could go on and on.

394,elpresidente-4,A huge miss,3,4 October 2021,"This movie is a mess, with a lot of boring parts and the interesting parts are very few in between.First of all, when you are making a movie about a green monster that smashes things, why do you turn this into a psychological drama? Not only was the psychological drama completely unnecessary it also failed to create actual drama. It's like nobody supervised Ang Lee. He definitely needed some supervision. The direction and editing is very weird. Ultra zoomed faces everywhere, split screens and picture-in-picture. Annoying! Due to the aforementioned attempt at psychological drama the pacing of the entire movie is bad. There's a scene near the end where two characters talk some boring nonsense face to face for six minutes straight and nobody is smashing anything. In a Hulk movie! Someone should've had the sense to see what a bad script this is and throw it out before filming even started. And funny enough, the movie ends right when there was something interesting about to happen. The Hulk is in some South American country and delivering medicine to local peasants, but local militia intervenes and steal the medicine. You see, that is interesting - there is some actual stake here, something to care about. The Hulk can use his powers to do some good, instead of randomly smashing things that confuse him. Anyway, this movie was a huge waste of money and talent. I should give it a score of one, but I'll add one more for the action scenes and one for Jennifer Connely.",Hulk

His mannerisms, his strength and power, his innocence...  These were things the movie got perfect to a T!  When the Hulk fought, the audience (myself included) cheered out loud.  And with good reason!  Here was the green giant himself, brought to life to the true extent of his power and being for the first time ever.  Lou Ferigno had a fairly good as a powered-down made-for-TV Hulk, but this is a role that no ""puny human"" can truly play.

I liked the first part of the movie which was making me think it was going to be like Darkman but 15 minutes the after ""the accident,"" I was wondering if he was ever going to change at all.  As in Daredevil, there was way too much back story, and the plot conveniances were a bit much.  Some of the CGI scenes are so dark you can't tell what's going on.  Despite its flaws I did like the comic book paneling done through some of the movie and the cameo with Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno was pretty awesome. The CGI worked for most of the movie, but there wasn't much in the way of bad guys to balance out the hulk.  Having the hulk attacked by a guy in crutches is kinda.. pathetic?  The biggest weaknesses though were that the movie ran too long and the story line too complex when we just wanted to see some smashing. Nick Nolte mumbles so much so you can't make out what he's saying and his character and plot line just doesn't add to the movie.  Get the director of Darkman online for HULK 2.",Hulk

In the theater where I was at, I just kept hearing the little kids say when does he turn into the hulk, and I'd hear them breathe in really hard whenever Bruce would get angry, and those weren't the times he would turn into the hulk yet.

401,Mister_Gordon_Shumway,Green Goliath,8,4 December 2007,"Flawed. This is the key word used by critics to describe HULK after its initial cinematic release. I think, in general, the fans were happy with the film. I'm going to go with 'very good'.Synopsis: ~ David Banner is a scientist working on human DNA. After the birth of his son, Bruce (Eric Bana), he becomes concerned, the child being quiet and withdrawn. The child only shows emotion when he is angry, his skin tinged with splotches of green during these moments of rage. Banner disbands his research after attempting to find a cure for his son. He causes an explosion at the research centre, accidentally killing his wife, and is subsequently condemned to a mental institution. Bruce is put into the care of foster parents.Twenty years later Bruce Krenzler (Banner) is a successful scientist like his father. David Banner (Nick Nolte) returns, working as a janitor in the research centre, watchful of his son as history seems to be repeating itself. Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) is the ex-girlfriend of Bruce and daughter of Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (Sam Elliott), the military commander who originally shut down David Banner's research. Ross is concerned that his daughter is working with Bruce, chiefly because Bruce is conducting similar experiments to those of his father. An accident in the lab results in Bruce being hit with large amounts of gamma radiation, which mixes with his already altered DNA. Enter the Hulk ~ Ang Lee's effort, I think, comes close to the original Marvel comic book created by (Stan Lee) and (Jack Kirby), especially with the use of picture-in-picture multiple scene framing. The juxtaposition - and movement of - these frames on screen is effective in that the viewer could be simultaneously watching a film and reading a comic book. A radiant score by (Danny Elfman) compliments the picture, the composer seemingly discarding his dreamy - almost whimsical - melodies like those found in films like 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Batman'. The idea of science and experimentation is conveyed with this 'new' almost off-beat electronic Elfman music while the tense scenes are punctuated by brass instruments; the stark sequences - the arid desert and the military base - enhanced with Middle Eastern vocal interludes.Lee has kept the storyline - the origin of the Hulk - along with the imagery - close to the pulp comic book whilst injecting his own style, drawing influences from Greek mythology and texts like 'Frankenstein' 'King Kong' and 'Beauty and the Beast'. The storyline running alongside this is the unstable relationship Bruce and Betty have with their fathers. This is not just a rampaging monster movie, but a film with depth and heart.What keeps 'Hulk' from being a five-star film is the effects used to create the Hulk. He is a computer-generated monster who could be just as comfortable on a Playstation or X-Box machine. Granted the effects are impressive when compared to the 1970s 'Bill Bixby' Hulk, but perhaps a little too impressive.Of particular importance - and what many critics have missed - is that Lee has captured the essence of who (or what) the Hulk is with the proficiency of a well-established director. The Hulk is neither hero or villain; rather, he is a tortured soul wandering the land in search of solitude ... and Betty Ross, of course.Lou Ferrigno (Hulk in the TV series) and Stan 'the man' Lee both have cameos in the movie as security guards.Matthew J Lee-Williams, Review.",Hulk
402,martin_g_karlsson,"The Hulk Hysteric, Nolte goes Nietzsche and Connelly Calms",7,11 May 2006,"The Hulk is angry again and this time hes not Lou Ferringo but a CGI monster, as strong as he was in the Marvel comic and greener than ever. But why is Nick Nolte, with his now trademark vagabond look, lurking in the background? The Hulk here becomes a symbol of male aggressiveness in general, or an over-aggressive person in particular. Its about power, and Nietzsche is paraphrased by Nolte on more than one occasion. The military is of no use here, they are just another type of aggressive power, and no power is as great as Hulk power! The Hulk can only really be stopped by a female, a Jennifer Connelly is needed to calm his green ass down. Ang Lee is no fool - the film makes a quite conscious attempt at creating a more systemic mythology, which gives it a substance that makes it rewarding to watch, in a way that it otherwise would not have been. Much like 'Batman Begins', and the Spiderman films, there is enough humanity within the frames of this picture to make it more than a CGI extravaganza.An FX feast it is though, but also cinematically beautiful. Photography, scenery and overall aesthetic is quite perfectly executed. Eric Bana as Banner works just fine (though he is no Bill Bixby!) and Jennifer Connelly is always very nice to watch on screen. Nolte plays his slime-ball card well. All in all 'Hulk' is more than meets the eye, and what does, is quite appealing as well.",Hulk

The first third of the movie that we spend waiting to see the Hulk really detracts from the rest of the movie.I will say that when the Hulk is on screen, when compared to the comic books (of which I have hundreds) he is almost 100% dead on. Fans were worried that Lee's interpretation would ruin the Hulk.  I don't think this is the case. Lee's only flaw was dragging on the non-Hulk scenes for far too long.If I only had to grade the scenes with the Hulk, I'd give this 10/10. Unfortunately, factoring in the rest of the movie, I have to say 7/10.",Hulk
404,flipcritic,The most introspective of the Marvel superhero movies that have come out so far,8,24 June 2003,"Of all the big name superheroes Marvel has to offer, HULK is one of the easiest to gravitate to. It's not hard to find what makes him appealing. Superficially, he is an unstoppable raging behemoth whose strength is rarely matched. This alone would be an obvious foundation for a film franchise. What is surprising (and ultimately refreshing) about this one is its willingness to explore the depth of the Hulk's dilemma. If the film's jade giant were absent from this movie, its story could still be the frame for another.The movie starts with an army scientist named David Banner who performs genetic experiments for the government. He carries one out on himself before fathering his son Bruce. After a few years into Bruce's childhood, a tragic event occurs, which results in David's incarceration for 30 years and separation from his son.Upon maturing, Bruce also becomes a scientist. Instead of his father's obsession with genetics, he develops a fascination for gamma rays and nano-med (almost subatomic medicinal) technology. He becomes victim of a lab accident that unleashes the Hulk; partly due to genetic mutation he inherited from his father, who just happens to work on the base as janitor, recently released from his sentence. To make things more interesting, Banner's co-scientist, Betty Ross is his former flame. And she just happens to be the daughter of General Ross, the man who jailed David Banner during his family's tragedy. It is this terrible event that holds the key to why Bruce transforms to his monstrous side, and to how their reunion will end.The movie starts slow, with admirable character development. By the time the Hulk appears, everyone's motivations are known with each personality sharply distinguished. Ang Lee loves showing humanity and human frailty in his stories as he has done exceptionally in EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN, THE WEDDING BANQUET, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, and THE ICE STORM. We discover the hidden storylines, the human aspects that can be just as interesting as the action. We discover that Bruce and Betty have both had fathers that they could never count on (that's probably what brought them together). We see David Banner and General Ross not primarily as power hungry males, but as caring fathers as well. We experience Bruce Banner's awkwardness and inability to express himself adequately, which makes us understand all the more why he begins to `enjoy' transforming into his raging alter-id.Though it's true that the Hulk doesn't appear until 45 minute into the movie, once he does, the action hardly stops. Sure there are scenes of destruction, but they are calculated, punctuating turning points in the movie, instead of bombarding the audience as mayhem in others. The backdrops upon which these action sequences are set upon are breathtaking. The battles rage from an underground base, to the vast majestic Monument Valley landscape, all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge and even to the very stratosphere. I can still vividly recall Images of the Hulk clashing with `hulk-dogs' in the California Redwood forests and him being chased by helicopter gunships in a concave rock formation in the Arizona desert.People remember Ang Lee for CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, which many consider (present company included) to be the greatest martial arts picture ever made. It left such big shoes to fill, even for Lee (At one point TIME Magazine labeled him, `America's Best Director'). Those who recall CROUCHING TIGER remember its sublime images of combat, but what set it apart in its genre was its poetic character involvement. We cared deeply for Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien, for their values, and for their quest for the green destiny. Lee does the same for HULK. In exposing its characters to danger, he wishes to reveal the gravity of their situations. Hardly ever does anyone utter a mutter a snappy line, emote a mushy sentiment, or deliver a cliché expression.Compare Bruce Banner's discovery of his newfound abilities with Peter Parker's (of SPIDER-MAN). He reacts with deep fear and confusion, whereas Parker reacts with excitement and exhilaration. The latter may be more amiable for audiences, but if I found out that I was growing microscopic claws on my fingertips and spewing webbing from my wrists, I'd be freaking out. Spider-Man has the comfort of shooting off a few quips along with his webs as he confronts his foes. Banner, along with other characters in HULK have no such luxury. The movie is not without joy though. It has several humorous moments, none of them in a light-hearted sense though.It should be said that this picture was blessed with a great cast. Eric Bana (BLACK HAWK DOWN & CHOPPER), who has star written all over him, conveys inner turmoil-slash-solidity very effectively as Bruce Banner. The ever-beautiful Jennifer Connelly reprises her wife-of-a-brilliant-but-mentally-unstable-scientist role from A BEAUTIFUL MIND as Betty Ross. I thought her main purpose was to appear as a captivating yet unreachable beauty for both Banner and the Hulk, and she serves her role perfectly. Nick Nolte has to my mind never given a bad performance, and he appears valuably scruffy and deceivingly two-faced as David Banner (he could be confused for one of the hulk-dogs). But of all of the main players, Sam Elliot (THE CONTENDER, WE WERE SOLDIERS, & THE BIG LEBOWSKI) impressed me the most with his controlled and palpable intensity as General Ross. At one point, with his glistening complexion and bulging neck veins, he looked more intimidating than the Hulk.The movie has a lot of other assets. It has a memorable score by Danny Elfman (who also did BATMAN and SPIDER-MAN). It has beautiful cinematography by Frederick Elmes (THE ICE STORM). It has wondrous visualization by using split-screens like window panes in comic books, such as several angles in one shot, or one window opening up into another (this is the most inventive use of the technique since Brian De Palma's FEMME FATALE). It also has buried moments of lyrical dueling between different characters. When Betty Ross says, `You weren't that hard to find.' and Banner retorts `Yes I was.' that instant carried a greater emotional weight. You'll understand it once you see it.Fans of the Hulk (like me) will be familiar with the several storylines that have been amalgamated into the screenplay, one of them being David Banner, who is Bruce's character in THE INCREDIBLE HULK TV series (speaking of which, Lou Ferrigno, who portrayed the TV Hulk, appears in a cameo with Stan Lee). The rest I leave up to the `Hulksters'. But for all the pluses that HULK has, the ones that I will take home with me are its ideas. That the Hulk is not just rage, he is pure innocence. He only smashes when provoked. He is a near mindless brute, but when calm, he is a child. He smites tanks that fire at him as a toddler would kick a toy after tripping over it.
As a character, the Hulk is the ultimate childlike id, the source of all instinctual impulses and demands for immediate satisfaction of primitive needs. As a film, THE HULK is the most introspective of the Marvel superhero movies that have come out so far. The X-MEN films have had the disadvantage of having too many characters, resulting in too many protagonists to follow. SPIDER-MAN and the BLADE movies were all about entertainment. Many comic book films barely touch on their themes, but HULK actually wants to deal with the issues it raises. No wonder I gravitate to it.",Hulk
405,Matt-441,"For grown-ups, not for kids",9,7 August 2004,"This movie is 50% drama and 50% action. The character depth is comparable if not better than the spiderman movies. This is not a kid's movie and I can see kids getting bored really quickly. Compared to other superhero movies including Superman, Batman, Spiderman, the hulk has a storyline that is quite touching - similar to the x-men series of movies.  If you liked the x-men series, you will like the hulk. If you enjoyed the newer batman movies, then this movie might bore you.  I give it 8/10 stars for great acting, great CGI detail, great character development, great storyline but poor CGI directing.  I hope they make a sequel.",Hulk

Why does the scientific imagery seem like it's from a cartoon. The jumpiness of the film imagery causes you to lose track of the story line very quickly. Plot elements are offbeat. Filming locations are strange.3.9 stars",Hulk

I mean, you didn't get to see the Hulk for the first hour of the movie. In the middle of the movie I just wanted to see the Hulk through someone. It's so dissapointing, expecially after spiderman (which was great.) They spent millions of dollars on this movie and now everyone thinks it sucks. Including me. Spare yourself from 2 1/2 hours of pain and don't see this movie.",Hulk

One of the least appreciated movies by marvel.",Hulk
409,JimShine,well I liked it,9,26 July 2003,"There are a lot of really negative comments about Hulk here, and if people like it so little there's probably nothing a really positive review would do to change their minds.  So rather than try to justify my position all I'll say is I had decided I wanted to love the movie and after a few minutes of the opening montage I was certain that I would, and all the way through I was thinking ""this is great"" and at the end I was happy.  So there.  Loved the Greek tragedy storyline (children punished by the sins of their fathers), loved the acting (especially Jennifer Connelly), adored the editing (the closest watching a film has been to reading a comic, not just the split screen but the closeups, significant lack of panning or tracking shots, etc), loved the fact that there was so little action for most of the movie, was amazed and constantly surprised by the action when it came (heh! Hulk falls from the stratosphere and Ang cuts to a brief metaphysical interlude! oh yes!)... OK, yes, I am justifying why I loved it.  I had a feeling this was going to be the first summer blockbuster that people hated because it was too clever, and it seems I was right.  People don't seem to appreciate Ride With the Devil either.  Puny humans!",Hulk
410,Capt_comicbook,"Hulk Smash, but not Smash Hit",7,23 June 2003,"Well, I rated this film a 7 of 10.  I am a comic book collector.  That half of me did not  enjoy the film, like it wanted to, the other half of me realizes that non-comic book fans have a greater possibility of enjoying this film. First, let me say that despite reservations concerning the CGI Hulk, I was impressed with the 'Hulk' scenes...  they really did strike a chord with the side of me that likes to throw temper tantrums when I don't get my way.   Several of the scenes were quite impressive not only in their execution but also with the approach Lee took in filming the scene. I also thought the acting was OK.  Not distracting, but added to the overly long and at times boring screenplay, the performances loose their luster, and youstart to look for flaws. I think that a lot of times when a movie doesn't keep you attention, people will tend to drift and find flaws that really aren't that important, and when a film is really boring in parts, we tend to find a lot of them as we aimlessly wander over the screen...  I think this is what happened to the Hulk, and I would discourage any parents from taking any attention-challenged children to this show... they will bore easily.",Hulk
411,devinshee,I Don't See Why It Is So Hated,8,10 September 2007,"It may not be 100% true to the comics, but its pretty good. I don't really care if it is not 100% true to the comics, but it is the comics. I am a big hulk fan. I love the TV series with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, ever since i was a kid. I used to read the comics, but not anymore i guess. And i liked the movie too. It was really a comic book movie, with the comic book panels on the screen, that was cool, and comic book come to life, i did not really find it distracting, it was creative and new. This movie is obviously more based on the comics, so no Lou Ferrigno running around in green paint. I thought the action scenes were pretty cool, especially the desert battle. But it is a little hard to see the action during the night scenes, such as the fight with the dogs, but you can see it though. I thought the special effects were cool, a few spots may look a little fake of course. The hulk may not be shown too much on screen, so it can show some talk and stuff. But it is a very intelligent movie and not goofy or anything. The music in the movie was very good, with the Hebrew music and stuff. The acting in the movie was serious, Eric Bana wasn't bad, and that goes for Jennifer Connelly, Sam Elliot is good as always. I think Eric Bana has a good thing going for him. The ending of the movie is good, but a little goofy and corny, but it was good. The story may not be everyones cup of tea, but i kind of liked it, even though the science stuff can be a little confusing. I really don't see why a lot of people hate it so much. I have been waiting for the movie a long time before it came out, and wondering how it would be with Ang Lee directing it, and Eric Bana being Bruce Banner. It turned out well, and intelligently. The model and special effects of the hulk were good, the action. I am looking forward to the new hulk movie next year, hope it's good. I just hope it is not a complete remake like people say. I hope it would have a sequel resemblance to it. So, i give the hulk movie about 8 and a half stars out of 10.",Hulk
412,NYKMarin8161,Disappointing film of 2003 (so far),5,26 June 2003,"OK, I admit. I saw the Hulk on my computer. It was a pretty good bootleg. I sat there expecting to see the type of super hero flick just like Spider Man or Daredevil. But I sat in front of the computer for 2 hours and saw a film with such a great story, drag before my very eyes. The Hulk had a great story and the direction of Ang Lee was perfect. I wanted to see more action. You don't advertise a film with such eye candy. You are going to get the dollars but you will have the audience disappointed. The point is that the Hulk had no real action what so ever. The scenes with the Hulk in the commercial, are the only scenes you see the Hulk at his prime. The Hulk isn't the only movie to succumb to lack of entertainment. Men in Black 2 was supposed to be my favorite summer of 2002. MIB 2 turned to be corny. Queen of the Damned made money because of Aaliyah's name, not the quality. She was only in 2 minutes of the friggin' movie!!!!!!!!!! But anyway, the Hulk gets one star for the direction of Ang Lee and a star and a half for the interesting story.**1/2 out of ****",Hulk

But the appearance of the actors is spot on and so is Hulk  himself.Most importantly the outside daytime scenes with Hulk in action are amazing and believe me unmissable for any movie fan...

414,masondbk-599-80448,i've had a better time watching paint dry,2,23 May 2015,Hulk is an American superhero film about one of my favorite superheroes so what could go wrong. Well to start the comic book panels and wacky transitions were stupid and annoying. There is way to much drama and there aren't enough action . this movie is so boring I would put it on my top 5 worst superhero movies of all time list. The premise is almost impossible to explain since the film seems to change premises. for the first 40 minutes it's about a boring unlikable scientist after that for 20 minutes it's about a raging green monster who smashes things. then it's about the scientist who is locked up in a military base underground then once again it's about a monster. long story short this movie can't make up it's mind on what it's about. With unnecessary brooding and too much dialogue this movie is just stupid. the only reason it's getting a two out of ten is because i respect Ang Lee for trying to make a good movie even if he failed.,Hulk
415,RMR-2,A comic book movie that seriously considers its characters,10,10 May 2004,"Hulk is not the usual superhero movie. There are exciting action sequences but the movie on the whole doesn't leave you feeling exhilarated, but rather sombre. Ang Lee has made a more thoughtful movie, which actually tries to develop its characters, and is interested in the relationship between Bruce and David Banner and Betty and General Ross and the resulting relationship between Bruce and Betty.First of all Betty. Her father is a career military man and has always been distant from her. She wants to be closer to him, but it seems clear that he doesn't quite know how to do that. She trusts him at times during this film, and those times prove to be detrimental to Bruce Banner.
Bruce Banner in this film is the walking wounded though he doesn't even know it. There is deep trauma in his early childhood and he has buried in down. He loves science and that's the only thing that seems to animate him. He loves Betty as well but can't open up to her - he just doesn't seem to be able to. He's repressed and he often awakens from nightmares that he doesn't understand, and doesn't want to. General Ross scorns Bruce's father and distrusts Bruce as well. David Banner, a military scientist, experimented on himself and passed the changes onto his son and he loves Bruce as the outcome of an experiment and nothing more. After the accident takes place, Bruce isn't able to repress all the time and clamp down on his feelings. Instead he lets go and becomes the Hulk.After two viewings, I realized how expressive the Hulk really is. The Hulk is Bruce's Id set loose. When he's not bothered, the Hulk is quiet and still. He looks closely at the desert flowers. When provoked, he replies in kind without hesitation. He is the four year old Bruce, full of pain and frustration, but this time supremely powerful and able to fight back. His roars at one or two points in the movie are roars of hurt and frustration, of a giant child who is desperately unhappy and angry. There are also moments when he is tender. When the rampaging Hulk sees Betty in a helicopter, he halts his attack, his anger gone at once, seeming almost wistful and ashamed at the same time. There is another, shorter moment when the leaping Hulk comes to Bruce's childhood home in a military base. He studies the house and we see the Hulk swallow a sob as some memory of Bruce's childhood returns to him. The Hulk, in the comics, is never a happy story. Betty is always longing for relationships with her father and Bruce, while Bruce is terribly scarred by what his father has done to him. The only way he can fight back is through the Hulk, and becoming the Hulk has repercussions. He is unhappy as Bruce and targeted as the Hulk. The leads in this movie are dysfunctional people, and the movie deals with them in a serious, even realistic way of a dramatic film. The Hulk is not a normal popcorn superhero movie. It doesn't deserve to be one.",Hulk

Well, I was really looking forward to watch this movie...even after a few of my friends told me i'd better save a couple of bucks rather than spend it to watch this movie...but still...i thought this movie is going to be nice ! Boy...i was wrong... the first part of the movie was particularly boring...i didn't know what Ang Lee is trying to do...maybe he's going for oscar again with this movie ! but it's for us to enjoy...something like popcorn movie...spiderman...x-men...but then, it has to be this boring...i'm not a movie critic whatsoever but just normal moviegoer who hopes for pure entertainment...save for a few interesting scenes especially at the desert, other than that this movie is a total disappointment. I don't know what other people is trying to say about the father-son relationship...etc...but in simple words, the HULK is not entertaining at all !!! So if there's gonna be a sequel, i just hope that someone take note of the flaws of this film and make it better...and lets not talk about the CGI...i've heard a lot on the fake CGI so i was prepared when i went to watch the movie...my expectation was really very very low...so I didn't bother so much about the CGI...just kept telling myself...oh...i knew about that...so a boring movie with bad CGI...you decide yourself...  **1/2 out of 5.",Hulk

Maybe you prefer the fantastic emptiness of the later Batman flicks. Yeah the CGI looks suspect in a couple of places, but it's never bad enough to make you have to fully suspend your disbelief in order to just continue watching the movie. It's more plausible that we have all just become special effects snobs in todays world of ever escalating new effects wizadry.Hulk is imaginitive, thoughtful, beautiful, entertaining and stylish. Not sure what the detractors were quite expecting, but I can't see that any other approach than the one Ang Lee and his crew took would have worked as well. Beats Spiderman. Nearly on par with X2, but for different reasons.

Avoid at all costs.",Hulk
419,impfac,Grrr! Frown! Boring!,2,30 December 2004,"Bottom line: Hulk frowns, grunts and groans a lot, but simply doesn't entertain. They should have put some of that $150,000,000 budget into a better director and screen writers.The hype lasted for months. Hulk toys. Hulk shirts. Hulk green cereal. Hulk ice pops. Hulk flavored condoms. Hulk was everywhere.Then we saw the green beast, and we all groaned. But him being a 13 foot behemoth didn't stop us! We're fans, and we see him if he was purple and wore a too-too (right?).Well, it turns out the problem wasn't with the Hulk's looks at all. The problem was he and his human counter part were horribly boring. the final insult: Hulk bounding miles into the air.

420,teppo-2,A great movie,9,26 May 2009,"This is, to date, my favorite superhero movie. I can but wonder why so many people think it is so bad.First, since it's a superhero movie, there's the action scenes. There's not too many of them, and what there is, is quite good.I recall there being some criticism about the Hulk's 3D model and how it is not detailed enough. While I kinda agree that it could be better, I do not think it is too distracting.Now, on to the story and characters. And here is the strongest part of the movie. The interaction of Hulk and Betty Ross is something that touches me on a personal level. And in general the characters are mainly well developed and have interesting enough interaction. The story progresses at a nice pace, not being too fast or too slow. It's definitely a ""smarter"" and even more emotional than, say, the Spider-Man movies.I can't think of too much else to say, since to me so much of what is good about this movie I can't really find the words for, and in the end it's the overall feeling that counts. I'll end this by saying that while the new ""The Incredible Hulk"" was a decent movie on its own right, in my books it doesn't hold a candle to this movie.",Hulk

422,customX13,More TALK than SMASH!,6,20 June 2003,"As a Hulk fan, I expected The Hulk to be on par like the rest of the recent super-hero action flicks one example ""DareDevil"" but came up a little short as far as timing. I understand they had to explain the story of Hulk but the beginning started out a drag and lasted all the way until finally in the middle of the movie where the comic book action at last kicked into gear. Just like the first ""X-men"" movie where they had to explain the existence for a handful of characters but in the Hulk this is one man for crying out loud, get to the action already! For the CGI, the Hulk does indeed look convincingly real. I'm glad they decided to go with this perspective rather than try to fit some pro-wrestler into a muscle suit or use green body paint, phew what a disaster that would've been. The action was just like I expected, right out of the comic book, very Hulk-like intensity, Hulk breaking and smashing things to pummeling evil villains to bits. The movie itself reads just like a comic book, showing dream sequences to split-screens to the dramatic positioning of the characters. I give applaud to Ang Lee and the crew for doing their homework. Like I said before, the only thing I hated was waiting for the Hulk to come alive, and it took way too long. Hopefully the sequel will be more exciting with a super evil villain for Hulk to play with. I'm a huge Hulk fan and I know this is just the start but overall 6/10.",Hulk
423,elusivedream78,If you're able to get through the slow beginning.. a treat.,6,15 November 2003,"I haven't read of the Hulk comic books, so the beginning of the movie (where we get the background and setup for the rest of the film, of course) was a little bit dull to me, I have to admit.  I was really looking for an action film, but in order to keep fans of the comic book series happy (in being faithful to the written version) and also those into mindless big-budget action, I guess both were needed.  It'd just be nice if they could've perhaps integrated the two together in a more condusive manner.  Regardless, I really did enjoy the later scenes of the film, especially the Helicopter-to-Ground fights.  Not a bad film, but the second hour is a lot more enjoyable to those who haven't turned a comic book page in many years, most likely.",Hulk
424,tomiron77,Better without the ending sequence,6,26 January 2004,"The movie was better than I thought until the ending sequence. *SPOILERS* ---meaning it was good up to where Jennifer Connelly (an absolute ANGEL for geeks!) calms down Hulk/Bruce while the whole LAPD and a sizable portion of the military surround them with weapons.After this scene, the ""dad"" had way too much movie-time, and the ending became somewhat too ridiculous. *REAL SPOILERS* Having the dad realize ""superpowers"" was the worst move. He was a pretty interesting figure up till then. And the mom running out in the desert after getting stabbed raising her arms toward the green explosion was somewhat strange and maybe the only typical Ang Lee ""narcisstic"" scene I didn't like. Meaning that I felt the flavour of the movie was uneven.In any case the tension in the beginning of the movie (mad scientist lab scenes etc.) was excellent. As was the US military trying to hunt down and destroy the Hulk scenes.Maybe one of the visually aesthetical problems was having two major characters being rather unkempt old men with a lot of facial hair. Somewhat opposite to the success of ""Pirates of Caribbean"" which avoided the usual pirates-movies trap of too large a grunge factor by having two extremely handsome leads in Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom.",Hulk
425,Keith-35,"Limited action, action movie",3,21 July 2003,"I did not enjoy this movie.  The seat began to feel uncomfortable half way through, and that's not good.  There were a number of problems with this movie.It simply took too long to start.  The story leading to the action was just too long.  Hulk, the comic hero!  I expected an action movie with some supporting story.  This was a story with some supporting action.The story was implausible.  It is not clear why there was hostility against the father. And even when the truth was finally revealed, why it intensified.His father wasn't evil, well not initially anyway.  It is not clear why he became evil.  It seemed out of character for him to send the dogs or even possible to mutate the dogs to that state.  (Isn't a generation needed?)During the Hulk's great escape, it was said that fighting made him more angry and made him fight more.  The to catch him was to calm him down.  `The Girl' was used to this effect.  When this father became a ball of energy, supplying more energy seemed to destroy him, not make him stronger.  And the whole fight between the Hulk and father made no sense.  It was nonsense, and that was the good part of the movie.In short, this was a waste of my Friday evening.",Hulk

I liked the story line and it had a great cast. The one thing I didn't quite like was the colour they chose for Hulk I reckon they should've gone with a darker tone. This certainly isn't the worst marvel movie in my opinion that position goes to Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance but it's not the best either. I do like the 2008s MCU movie The incredible Hulk a bit better but my favourite portrayer would have to be Mark Ruffalo In the Avengers films.

Parts of the beginning should of been cut out it was too long before he got hit by gamma rays.  Ang Lee is a good director, but they should have gotten a fan of the Hulk to direct this one.

430,Krakn3Dfx,"Flawed, but still highly enjoyable",8,27 August 2003,"I didn't expect much from Ang Lee's interpretation of The Hulk mythology. I've never seen his previous movie, Sitting Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or whatever it was called.  People say it was excellent, but I've never been remotely interested in seeing it.  Regardless though, I went into The Hulk with the lowest of expectations, already tainted by the fact that Hulk would be completely CGI. Was I surprised?  You bet.  I enjoyed this movie immensely.  Were there problems with the script?  Sure, it's a superhero movie, there are always holes big enough to drive a Mac truck through in superhero movies.  XMen, Superman, Spiderman, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, all had plot holes, all had issues which you can sit and nitpick all day and still not resolve them to everyone's satisfaction.  Did this lessen my enjoyment of The Hulk?  Absolutely not.  People have complained that the first half of the movie is filled with boring, unnecessary setup before you get to see The Hulk for any real amount of time.  I say these people need to go back and watch the series with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, and even read the original Hulk comics.  The Hulk mythology is about Bruce Banner's struggle to separate his own life from The Hulk.  It's about how his mutation affects his relationships with the people around him. There's a scene in the movie, which is shown in the previews, where Banner has a dream and is looking in the mirror and sees The Hulk, and The Hulk reaches through the mirror and kill him.  That pretty much sums up the world he lives in, where he is constantly being pulled between being a normal, civilized human being that goes to a job, comes home, and does things that regular people do, or becoming a raging green monster that destroys everything it touches and has little regard for anything except its own core fury.  This movie touched on that perfectly, and while I think Eric Banya may not have been the best choice for the Bruce Banner character, I think he did a more than acceptable job as far as stepping into the shoes of Banner for the first time.  I eagerly look forward to a sequel, and hope that Lee is once again at the helm of this exciting, dangerous world of The Hulk.",Hulk

Did you read the comics?The Hulk is not a violent character by definition, he is cursed and trying to control his new found 'disability'! If you wanna see action, see Matrix or Daredevil (if you dare!) but Hulk is a guy cursed with a weakness of character (or in retrospect a strength of will) who is trying vainly to control his rage and not become that which he hates, a controless animal!It is not a story of anger and hatred but bravery and hope...!So lets not hate a film for portraying a character as a man who hopes to control his anger and be a normal guy but embrace it as an insite into our own hopes of control!",Hulk
432,Holitao,"Ang Lee's ambitions efforts based on the popular DC Comic book series are often masterfully executed, yet fails to bring toughness and excitement critical to this genre.",7,23 June 2003,"Even with all the muscle and rage, potentially explosive `Hulk' is an unsatisfying action film experience.  At first, it seemed like an odd choice for a character sensitive director like Ang Lee but considering his genre-breaking resume, the producers were hoping to breath art into action. As it turns out, Ang Lee's ambitions efforts based on the popular DC Comic book series are often masterfully executed, yet fails to bring toughness and excitement critical to this genre.  Nick Nolte's tyranny and Jennifer Connelly's aching stare are effective as the tormented father and compassionate girlfriend, Betty Ross, respectively.  Eric Bana's Bruce Banner and Sam Elliot's military man Ross are serviceable but too often get eclipsed by their counter parts.  Danny Elfman, a veteran scorer of blockbuster movies, provides the film with energy often lacking in the film.
 `Hulk' aims to remain faithful to the original material and to connect emotionally but come at a price of tensions either being subdued or indirect, critical for an action arena where the experience is more visceral than emotional.  Making a good action film that rock is as difficult as a good art film that transcend.  Still, it is welcoming to see Hollywood trying to do something different and this one rates 7/10.",Hulk
433,jmm509,A hit of entertainment!,7,21 June 2003,Ang Lees terrific film Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was a show of his brillance now he's enlightend it with us again. A doctor experimenting with scientific studies finds himself soon aenough a massive green hulk whenever anger seems to strike.  Jennifer Connely plays Bruces love intrest and also the daughter of a four star general who had Bruces father locked and plans to do the same for Bruce.  He battles for his freedom from the army halfway through the movie until they place him in a desert base. I liked the action intensity that the movie contained but the only downfall of the film was the daffy looking computer-generated hulk.  I would found the movie to be even better if they would have just used a regular person. We find great acting in the film especially from Nick Nolte who plays Bruces father and also the reason who is and Sam Elliot who gives the film its intelligence and the reason why it belongs on stage.  Hulk seems to be like no other character like Batman or Superman because he doesnt actually save people from danger but he tries to avoid.  SEE IT!,Hulk
434,duke33,The Unbearable Hulk,3,27 September 2004,"Somewhere, Bill Bixby must be rolling around in his grave. Ang Lee managed to take a fantastic comic book story written by the genius Stan Lee, and twist into this garbled mess of a movie. I'm not a comic book purist, so I'm not going to debate the origin of the Hulk as depicted in this movie vs the comics. However, Ang Lee's adaptation of the Hulk origin is bizarre, and frankly just not that interesting. The acting is fine, but it's really the directing and editing of the movie that is really sub-par. The scene transitions were just nauseating...I think Ang Lee was trying to keep the movie feeling like a comic book (with the ""panels"" of action going on) but it didn't do it for me.The special effects when they do show up are pretty good, but if you're looking for any big fights, then you'll be sorely disappointed. There's a scene where the hulk battles 3 dogs (granted, they were mutant dogs, but still...how lame) and another scene at the end that defies explanation, as to how stupid the fight is.In closing, I gave it a 3 out of 10...I almost turned it off halfway through, but felt that I had already invested an hour, so I might as well watch the rest. Maybe not my best move.",Hulk
435,Sergeant Hulka,"One of the year's best, even though it isn't as good as it could have been.",8,3 July 2003,"I don't understand why so many critics and moviegoers disliked this film so much. If one paid any attention at all to the massive hype surrounding ""Hulk,"" one should've known that it was going to be a departure from the character of the Hulk/Bruce Banner as he has been portrayed before. If you went to the movie uninformed, you can only blame yourself...In contrast, I never appreciated The Incredible Hulk until I saw this film. Ang Lee whips up some juicy psychodrama at the beginning which, unfortunately, is never properly resolved. The stars of this movie are Sam Elliot(in an uncharacteristically reserved performance), Nick Nolte(who puts his heart and soul into a difficult role that a lesser actor would fudge), and Josh Lucas(who plays a smug _____, which is his specialty). The only regrettable thing about ""The Hulk"" is that Ang Lee set out to make an artsy, ambitious film based on a comic book. Somewhere along the way, the film got away from him and the conclusion is somewhat unsatisfying. It's still one of the year's best(so far).",Hulk

438,mrmunkoms,More of a comic book sense than all the others,8,27 November 2003,I find that this movie is highly underrated.  I expected this movie to bad but what I got was a great adaptation of the comic.  Ang Lee did a real great job in giving it such a sense of a comic book.  Bravo to you Ang Lee. The CGI is very well done though it may not look that way from the previews. Most people find the movie slow paced but I think the pace is just right. A good action/thriller movie. 8.5/10,Hulk
439,daveogilvie,Ahead of its time - Good back story,7,21 May 2016,"If you saw this when it first came out, you would probably have hated the split screen cut away's etc The story seemed complicated at the time and it was the first re-enactment since the TV series so a lot of the audience had a sentimental attachment to Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno. I've watched this on TV over the years and for some reason I am strongly drawn to it. I just think its underrated. Watching it now 21st May 2016 I think it does fit in with the Marvel Universe and offers a good backstory especially of his love for Betty Ross. The affects are not totally bad as when you watch you become more enthralled with the story. I am still not a fan of the split screen/24 dual story imaging but otherwise I think it is an underrated film. I'm neither DC or Marvel i'm more the action hero and for me it was always Superman and Spiderman /Incredible Hulk as the also rans. Superman was just the hero. As a kid growing up nothing more i'd love to do sometimes would be wear a shirt id grown out of and try and do muscular stretches at 10 and burst that old school shirt. This film has grown on me now i'm 43 and while I did n't like it at the time its grown on me the more I've seen it over the years on TV. Superman Returns V Hulk then this wins as Superman Returns was such a missed opportunity. Casting is great Bana,Elliot,Connelly and even Nolte buying into comic book Folk Lore for the time. When I first watched Hulk id have given it a 5.5 i'd now have to say its worth a 7. The special effects are not bad still - ie they draw you in and you don';t question the rendering like some tech head. The story seems easier to understand and HULK as a character fits in with the current Avengers Marvel Universe. Overall it's a film thats aged well and should be up-rated rather than under rated.",Hulk
440,Jollycox,In a Word...,4,9 July 2003,HORRIBLE!!!Where do i start? The Hulk isn't one of my favorite Comic Characters but Ive always been interested in him. Before going into this movie i thought this movie would have a horrible CGI Character and A SUPER Awesome Plot. What I got was switched around.The CGI was pretty awesome except for the desert scenes. I mean He looked great and had awesome facial features. The shadow and dirt was good too.The story in one word or less.....SUCKED. They could have stuck to the comics a little more. The script for this film should have never been greenlit.The story was slow and whenever there was action I didn't care for it. It dragged on forever with a crappy ending.I give it a 4/10.

This Hulk film on the other hand is exactly what I expected and further more what I wanted; I wanted it to be what it is a hard hitting, guns (big forearms) blazing, popcorn flick for turning the brain switch to off and kick back.

By the story, the charcters, the CGI but then it just dragged on and on.By the 120 minute mark EVERYONE in the cinema wanted it to end and its ending, where Nick Nolte turns into a big dragon is absolutely dire and totally ruins the movie.

It wasn't that late, but we may admittedly have been tired.  Still, we've seen a lot of movies in that state, and as long as they are interesting, we somehow manage to stay awake.I decided to trudge through it until the first transformation, at which point I figured I'd be able to stay awake.  No such luck... I was falling asleep DURING the transformation.  We gave up, and decided to get a good nights sleep and pick up from where we left off the next day.Second night: same thing.  Started with the transformation, during which were parts we didn't remember - because we must have been dozing.  So we watched that whole scene again.

I could maybe go with the scenery chewing performance of Nick Nolte. I could talk about the unnecessary use of split screen shots. I could talk about the new-agey smarmy poo that passes for a film score. I could go on and on about the heavy handed use of Psychobabble that tries to add depth and only drags this goofy mess into nothingness. I could see how the Budget probably tempted Ang Lee to try everything, like a freak show fat teenager at an all you can eat restaurant. On the same night I watched this yuck, Jackass the Movie, and The In Laws and I can truthfully say that Jackass is much better film. Ang Lee forgot one major factor when he did this, FUN. It was never for a nanosecond, FUN. This was a comic book, not War and Peace. There needs to be at least a fifteen year moratorium on making any more over-budgeted comic book movies, but as long as Hoolyweird has its way with teenage boys we will have more of this stuff until the loss of enough money stems the flow of garbage.",Hulk
445,Johnny_Shannow,Migraine inducing movie!,1,5 November 2005,"This movie is horrendous and painfully boring to watch, it gives me a migraine to see it all the way through. The annoying comic book like split screen, especially will gives you a splitting headache. I can't believe it's rated on average any higher than 3 stars. The acting, directing, and script are a joke, such a shame that a great character like the hulk got the worst cinematic treatment of a comic book movie ever. Ang Lee's art house style of directing was probably fine for Crouching tiger, hidden dragon but in Hulk it really feels out of place.Eric Bana is a fine actor in the other movies I've seen him in Troy and Chopper, but in this film whenever he was supposed to be enraged to the point of turning into the hulk, he seemed like a 3 year old play acting. Actually it's totally hilarious to see him gasping, groaning and struggling for breath, even the film itself makes a joke of it, when Nick Nolte mockingly imitates his childish whining and screaming towards the end.",Hulk
446,lee3993,"HULK: One that is large, clumsy, or awkward (Webster's dictionary)",6,19 January 2007,"That's exactly what this movie is. Large, in that it is well over 2 hours long and probably cost a fortune to make. Clumsy, in that no one wants to see a movie that turns into a cartoon whenever the main character is on screen. And last but not least, awkward, in that similar more successful movies, such as ""Spiderman"", have proved that live action is what makes a comic book hero come to life on the big screen. If a man could be transformed into a ""Predator"" or an ""Alien"" over 20 years ago, surely todays make-up artists can turn one into the ""Hulk"" in 2003. What were the producers thinking? I can't believe that Stan Lee allowed the makers of the ""Hulk"" to turn what could and should have been a cinematic breakthrough into a second rate misfire. A fine cast is totally wasted in this convoluted mess. Eric Bana was excellent as Bruce Banner. Sam Elliot and Nick Nolte were also feasible in supporting roles, but the whole concept of transforming from a man into a cartoon character is totally unforgivable in a time when modern technology (CGI for example) allows us to accomplish almost anything on the big screen.",Hulk

Any chance to see one of my comic book heroes from my youth on the big screen is always worth the price of admission.We've seen a lot of them, over the years...Batman...Superman...Captain America. (Ick.) We even saw the Punisher. The last few seasons have been a nice thrill ride. It's so nice to see the Marvel name up in lights. The X-Men. Spiderman. Daredevil. And now the Hulk.I heard quite a few snickers when the Green Beastie was doing his Batroc imitation, but that was a serious cool factor for me. Too bad they couldn't have pulled that off back in the Lou/TV series days...I always thought that was kinda hokey, but heck, like I said...any time you get to see your fav comic book heroes come to life...Anyway...back to the film. I loved Sam Elliot as General Ross. Awesome job. But the backstory...Oh. My. God. It's been a loooooong time since my eyelids actually got droopy in a movie. And the fades and transitions...hmmm...I'm not that familiar with the director, so I don't know if the frame screen sequences are a directorial trademark, or just a tip of the hat to the comic book panel origins of The Hulk. I just know they didn't do much for me...All in all, I was just a little disappointed. After seeing what was done with the X-Men, X-Men 2, Spiderman and Daredevil, I guess I just had my hopes up a little too high. Visually, they made the Hulk everything I could have hoped for. I just think there was too much in the beginning, and the end...well, I don't care much for swirling, metaphysical baddies. Probably why I never cared for Dr. Strange.So, I was entertained, but I would have been better entertained if I had waited until it went to the cheapie movies, or out on video.",Hulk
451,ptcommish,Just Not That Good,5,30 June 2003,"I really tried to like this movie.I was a fan of the comic, and watched the 70's Bill Bixby show.  I was a Hulk guy.I read the reviews and saw that it was not your typical Blockbuster film. It was dark, it had depth.  I liked what I was hearing.But when it came down to it, the film just did not work.  It was messy and convoluted - it trudges along and does not go anywhere.  I don't mind a buildup and don't need to see an explosion every minute. But with so many flashbacks and information about the main character's fathers, it became a jumbled mess.Make the story simple and make the emotions and experiences of the main characters complicated.  Why did we have to have the subplots of the fathers?  Couldn't a laboratory accident work by itself, and not have to be tied to the ""sins of the father"".One positive is the CGI.  When I saw the TV ads, I too thought the Hulk looked fake.  But as I watched the movie, this was not the case.  In particular the scenes where Hulk is being shot look impressive.  The CGI is not the problem with this film.Hulk is not ""Godzilla"" bad, but it is just not good either.  Rent this film and save the money and buy a good movie on DVD.Rating: 6 out of 10",Hulk

Though I'm not a big fan of Eric Bana's work in this film, the entire cast seemed reasonably comfortable and the story pushed forward as a reasonable rate, then Nic Nolte comes into the mix.Don't get me wrong, I think Nolte put forth a comendable performance (though it was easily over shadowed by Sam Elliot), but his character was almost completely unnecessary. David Banner served no purpose in this film after the opening credits initial set up. Each time the movie brought him into the mix, the plot seemed to simply stall until his character had left and the other elements of the film were allowed to push onward.This dilemma grows worse as the film goes on. There seems to be no comprehensible reason for Nolte to send his mutated dogs after Betty. And even less of a reason for Nolte to suddenly gain the power to absorb the properties of whatever he touches. Why, when you have gone through an hour and twenty minutes of a film without giving the Hulk a super villain, would it be necessary to throw one into the mix in the last act?Having done this, the writers then feel the need to extend the movie well past its most climatic point just so that the Hulk can now do in his, now supervillain, father. Why?Why, why why?Do yourself a favor. If you haven't seen this movie... DON'T. I feel like I wasted 2 hours and 8 dollars on this piece of garbage.

I found myself rivited by the effects coupled with the intricate plot, for they are truly a step ahead of the rest at the moment. I laugh at people when they say ""waah, nothing happens for an hour!!"" well, that is a dull inexperienced view for a little thing known as character development. If the film had started with action i would have been disappointed because Stan Lees vision wasn't of just mindless destruction, but an intricate story with intelligent undertones and evolving characters. Ang lee has used his unique talent to take a slightly different view on what could have been another rubbish spiderman clone.

There is much sadness and tragedy in this film and most of it is too dark for small kids (there was one child or another crying throughout 90% of this movie). That is not to say it is not an exciting film. I just feel that it is more exciting as a unique vision in film-making rather than just action for the sake of a thrill-ride type excitement.Go see this film if you want to see an Ang Lee film.

457,Freycinet,Best of the recent comic book adaptations.,8,18 July 2003,"Hulk is a surprisingly good movie, and will please someone who has been disappointed by Spiderman or - shudder - X2 in recent months. It has much more psychological depth than either of those two offerings (easy, when compared to X2) and Ang Lee uses some ingenious effects to convey the feel of a comic book. This especially shows in the very creative cutting of the movie. Scenes change not just by fading into each other, but by weird shifts, in-laid boxes, etc., just like the pages of a comic book. A great way to pay tribute to the original medium and make it obvious that the movie is not here to represent reality.As for the acting it is good and convincing. Actors being mainly just hollow vessels for the dialogue in the script, they do the job well. The script is very good, especially because it is serious about the personal issues of the main characters and doesn't degenerate into a succession of mediocre one-liners as in most recent superhero movies. Nick Nolte seems to have been asked to play himself, which is rather amusing: he looks exactly like his recent drunk driving mug shot...Another funny bit is the obvious references to the computer game Half-Life. A huge underground laboratory is an almost exact copy of the one in the game.All in all a film I can truly recommend, if you want to go and see something superhero-ish and with good effects.

Many reviews cry about it being lumbering and boring.This certainly not Spiderman. It is not a loose and joyful film. It is a thinking man's film for lack of a better term that tries to give some emotional weight to what's going on.It's funny that by the end of the Batman movie franchise's run everyone (including comic book fans) cried about how ridiculous it had all become. All flash no substance. No reason to care about the characters and plotlines that have no purpose but to set up the next big budget action sequence.Now if you dare to try to put some substance into a comic book movie people cry that it's boring. I appreciated the Hulk for trying to be a legit unique movie and thought it suceeded in making me care about the monster and a character I had little interest in going into the theatre (even as a comic book fan). I liked it alot more than I expected to. I just wish it ended 15 minutes earlier than it did because the final action sequence was hard to follow and existed to tie up a loose plot end that could have waited until the inevitable sequel.,Hulk
461,Mr. Bennett,Nice try though and Jennifer rocks!,6,17 March 2004,"First of all, let me say that I am not much of a comics fan. I knew the story of Hulk but not the details. I wanted to see it because every now and then I like watching an action flick and, mainly, because I wanted to see what Lee would have done with a movie like this. I think the story is pretty much known to most people in here so I'll focus on the impression I was left with. First thing that 'hit' me was the split screens thing. I have to admit that this technique gives the movie the comic book looks but in many scenes I found it irritating and confusing. I didn't know which way to look and what to pay attention to! Another thing that looked weird was... Hulk. I don't know how he looked in the comic book but in this movie he looks so...how shall I put this...he looks like these football guys in college, with lots of muscle but no brains. That, on the other hand, is exactly what makes you feel sorry for him. A different face might have given him the sense that he's too cruel too care or something like that. Thinking it again right now, I think it served its purpose. But it still looks kinda weird. The special effects were well made with many colors that, once again, gave you the feeling of actual reading a comic book. The performances were pretty good, especially Bana's. I think he was the perfect choice. Now, Connelly, once again, proves that she is a very, very good actress. Her performance was just the right one. She is not going over the top, or something. She is losing the man she loves, her father is responsible for that, but instead of screaming or yelling, she looks calm while her emotional explosions shows us how she really feels. Not to mention her beauty. (She should really keep that hair style) And we're in the final scene, the fight with Hulk's father, that just did not make any sense. The effects were all over the scene, images just kept rushing. I did not get a thing. :o(I think Lee wanted to do so many things, thats why he shot scenes from many different angels and many times, and the split screens, that in the end he overdid it. I believe he tried to stick to the comic book looks but in a movie that is not necessarily a good thing. I can't say I did not enjoyed watching it, no, I had a great time, except some of the split screen scenes. The music was nice, and the performances too. I think I'd go with a 6.5 out of 10. But when I get to vote it has to be either a 6 or a 7, right?",Hulk
462,jcorpuz@ucsd.edu,A great movie with lots of style to go around,8,25 June 2003,"The Hulk is the latest offering from the suddenly hot line Marvel comic book hero movies. It is dark, exciting and wonderfully stylish.  Although the movie suffers a little from its seriousness (a little humor he and there wouldn't have hurt), it is refreshing to see an action movie that tries (and mostly succeeds) to have a more dramatic tone, rather than having to add in gratuitous sex or pointless little gags in order to hedge its bets.  The real strength of this movie, and the real reason to go and see the movie, is the flair that director Ang Lee crafts the movie with.  He brings the comic book to life and the style of the comic book wonderfully drenches every shot. Case in point, its an interesting new take on the comic book movie genre that really will surprise you. It's certainly not Oscar-worthy deepness but it isn't so cheesy as other action movies are.",Hulk

Hulk is not your typical summer action movie where the action drives the movie. Instead it's a beautiful, well-paced movie with complex characters and an interesting story that just happens to have a lot of action. I know it sounds strange that a movie called Hulk could be all this, but in the director's hands the `monster' has been elevated to a classic status, more like Frankenstein than a comic book character. If you are familiar with Ang Lee and have seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon then you know what to expect and won't be disappointed.",Hulk
464,iftekhar25,A new touch to a new genre,9,10 July 2003,"This movie really adds a new touch to a new genre of movies. The comic book style fonts is seen before in Spider-Man, but the comic-book style screen layout is really new and very nice, actually. I actually like the idea of the screen looking like a comic book page with live action scenes in each box. A smart, but inevitable development, I think, in this relatively new genre of movie that is probably going to monopolize summer blockbusters for a long time to come.I also enjoyed the artistic representations and relations between big and small, the way the universe and a cell are put into a screen and made to seem almost the same, or a desert landscape and fungus on a rock.All in all, I really enjoyed this movie. If people complain about the CG mindlessly, I'm sorry, but that's really dumb. The Hulk's modelling was very good, but I'll admit from one of the posts in the forums, that they could have textured him better. When I showed my mother a poster of The Hulk, she said it looked like plastic. That is intelligent criticism. Just saying ""The CG sucked"" is dumb. The CG was good. He interacted very nicely with his environment.I liked the idea of them developing the story properly for almost an hour into the movie before giving us even a whif of the Hulk. I think that does justice to a large movie franchise in dedicating the first part to proper, human development of the character (unlike in Spider-Man; I was somewhat surprised at how fast they introduced the superhero).And this character development wasn't at the expense of the entertainment either. There was enough ""Hulk Smash"" to keep it entertaining.The ending was also good. It nicely wrapped up the story in the movie while leaving enough room for a sequel. I'm sorry, but after Lord of the Rings and Matrix Reloaded, movies that end as if they were a whole movie cut into half seriously, SERIOUSLY tick me off, even if that's the point. Even the Spider-Man ending left a lot hanging. It left with Spider-Man all fine and dandy, swinging around. The ending in Hulk is where something actually ends and nothing but a new story can only ever develop.Casting was really good. The young and old versions all looked like each other. Absolutely seemless. In fact, even their 4-year-old versions were good.I'll rate it a high 9/10 because 1. it has a good story, 2. it has good action, 3. it was deep for a comic book movie, and Ang Lee didn't mess it up, and 4. the novelty in the comic book-ish feel on-screen.",Hulk
465,Mr__Underhill,Fails on so many levels....,1,16 January 2004,"I didn't expect much from this having laughed at the trailer.  Having seen it I can't say that Hulk succeeds on any level, though possibly the split screen (comic book) camera angles are an effective feature to have on this comic ripoff.  Nothing need be said about the acting...it was awful. 
The public generally hated the special effects, and for once they are correct.  As computer animation goes, this is by far the least convincing of this century.  The realism was so absent that they might as well have just painted in the big green guy.  He didn't match with the scenery and the physics governing his movements didn't resemble the way any object (living or otherwise) might move on Earth.  The closest depiction I can compare the Hulk to is that of a bouncing rubber baby/frog on the moon.  Somehow I was more convinced by the original King Kong and virtually any claymation figure you may care to name.  The screenplay was far too unfocused to hold any tension.  The characters motives were far too one dimensional hold any interest.  In general the 70's TV show was better in spite of Lou Ferrigno's comical grunting and flexing...at least he looked like a real creature.  What I liked about the TV show was that the main focus wasn't just about a monster that breaks things...though that's how it usually ended (thanks Lou).  The main focus was on the issues surrounding David Banner (very well acted by Bill Bixby). It was a good exploration of the nature of human emotions and in a way it could be compared to the secluded lives of people who for whatever reason fall through the cracks or have a side of themselves that they can't show. I didn't really get any of that from the movie, which seemed to be all over the place.  I felt the same way about the new Planet of the Apes, though that was at least somewhat watchable.",Hulk

I'm a fan of comic books, (although I never read the hulk) however, this movie didn't capture the feel of a good comic book movie (see X-men II for an example of a good one).  The CGI was pretty terrible as well, and that's all I really went to go see. The protagonist was a lifeless character whos flacid acting and terrible voice did nothing to move the movie forward.  The villian in this movie was also a failure.  It seemed that the writer has some deep seated emotional problems regarding his(or her) father.

This is a very different comic book movie,one that takes time to develop the inner conflicts of a character,and here that is very compelling. We witnes Bruce Banner's tortured past,how he is holding onto a dark seceret. This add extra layers to the film as his father comes into play(the reason he is so tormented) The story is about him manifesting all his internal problems physically,enter the Hulk. The Hulk is the opposite of Banner,barbaric and powerful. able to accomplish incredible feats of superhuman strength but simple in intelligence. He is everything Banner isn't and is able to express the rage banner has bottled up. I find this story very compelling,the actors are all well cast and strong and the action scenes are very good. One thing I could never understand is why people ripped on the special effects in this movie,they are startlingly real looking and astonishing to look at. I also believe that the action scenes in this movie are more epic and emotionally fueled. From the dog fight to the epic battle in the desert to the final confrontation,it is epic",Hulk
469,DeadpoolX,Flawed but interesting,7,7 November 2003,"Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" is without a doubt the most bizarre big-screen comic-book adaptation I have ever seen.  It's a bizarre dichotomy of comic visuals and arthouse drama, with a couple of big action sequences thrown in to appease those viewers who were expecting a summer blockbuster.""Hulk"" is not about a large green monster smashing things, although it has that too.  It's about how parents mess up their children and then deal with it in all the wrong ways later in life.  Bruce Banner is an emotionally dead ticking time bomb thanks to his evil father's genetic meddling, while his recently-ex-girlfriend Betty is completely estranged from her career-military father due to his lack of involvement in her life.  When the Hulk himself finally comes along, we realize he's not Banner's rage - he's ALL the psychological baggage his father left him with.Fittingly enough, the two show-stealing performances here come from Nick Nolte and Sam Elliott as the two fathers whose sins are at the core of the film.  As it stands, ""Hulk"" is not the best movie around, but it's an interesting one, and I prefer a unique film that makes me think to a more consistently paced one that doesn't.  It's a fine piece of unexpectedly cerebral melodrama - but it's far too thoughtful to be a successful action movie.",Hulk
470,aeriz,Better than expected.,6,20 June 2003,"I had my doubts about hulk being transferred to the big screen.  Thought that he was too cartoonish to be a believable realistic character. X-men for example was a comic book movie too but you could buy what was going since it tried to be realistic.  After watching the hulk though, he was still cartoonish but I accepted the fact that he could exist in that world.  The problem I have with the film is the excessive use of fancy transitional effects.  There was an abundant use of multiple onscreen frames likely used to simulate comic book pages but that eventually began to hurt my eyes and became a distraction since you couldn't focus on a single frame without ignoring the others.  Hulk is a decent movie but it suffers by being way too much like a comic book which in the past, of early comic book films (fantastic four), brought the genre down.",Hulk
471,jriddle73,"""Hulk"" & the state of criticism of it",9,29 June 2005,"Ang Lee's ""Hulk"", at two years after.Perusing the negative reviews of the film collected at the Rotten Tomatoes site, I'm stricken by the degree to which the negativity directed at it by allegedly professional film critics is based upon the fact that it dashed (rather than living up to) their rather low expectations for it. The assumptions underlying so many of the criticisms are that the film is supposed to be a brainless ""summer blockbuster,"" but isn't. Another variation: that it's a film based upon a comic book, and that all such projects are supposed to be mindless rubbish for dazzling bumpkins (To those of us with some genuine knowledge of the field, this variant is particularly entertaining in that it's inevitably accompanied by a string of authoritative assertions regarding comics which demonstrate only the offended critics' abysmal ignorance of the medium). ""Hulk,"" it seems, doesn't know its place; it commits the sin of aiming for something more than mediocrity. In a sense, this is a testament to the film's quality. It clearly doesn't cater to such low expectations.Criticism of the film's CGI--a more common one at places like IMDb where there's far less pretense that a poster actually has anything of value to say--can be set aside as the superficial whining it is. In spite of what so many ""summer blockbuster"" fans seem to think, special effects aren't a story; they're just a means of telling one. The CGI in ""Hulk"" is competent. Beyond that, it doesn't matter.Likewise the vacuous ""it's boring"" complaint. Modern viewers with no attention span be advised up front that you will find ""Hulk"" challenging, and would be better served by spending your ""entertainment"" budget on trash like ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" and leaving the real movies to the adults.I don't insist that a fan of typical Hollywood summer fare actually offer some rational critique of the picture--I'm not a cruel man. I do, however, insist that, for anyone who expects to be taken seriously, ""Hulk"" must be accepted or rejected for what it really is. For my part, I think it's a misunderstood minor masterpiece, a film in the vein of ""Blade Runner"", ""Excalibur,"" and ""Once Upon A Time In The West""--all generally snubbed in their day, all now just as generally hailed as classics. I'd like to think I live in a society where this is the fate that one day awaits ""Hulk""; it certainly deserves it. Time will tell, I suppose.",Hulk

May be because of that ""temper-struggeling theme"" (like ""The Shining""), but now......I really don't care about the movie. I think it's OK, nothing special; and the special effects aren't great - the Hulk looks like just another drawn character. But it isn't the worst movie, it's just average.And there's Eric Bana. Well, first I thought he was OK. He did OK in the movie as well, but the big turn off came when he starred in ""Troy"" - that really bad movie.

Theatre was filled will all age groups and the audience's laughter at some of the intense? emotional? scenes pretty much indicated the reaction by conversations overheard as we walked out.

476,bdavis-5,An Interesting But Questionable Experiment,9,18 July 2003,"7/10This is a difficult movie for me to assess because it is an interesting but questionable experiment. It seems that Ang Lee, the director, decided to adapt a superhero comic by fleshing out a serious, profound drama on the skeleton of a literally-translated, comicbook framework of style, dialogue, and story. This is a fresh but risky approach to the adaptation of a comicbook, and I admire Lee for his daring. However, I think that his lack of familiarity with the Marvel comics disqualified him from being able to follow his own approach successfully. The film's problem is not that it tries to tackle psychological and religious themes that are too pretentious for a comicbook - after all, those of us who grew up on Marvel know that their comicbooks always tried to combine (often unsuccessfully) these kinds of literary themes with the superhero action. The problem is that too much of the dialogue is delivered as isolated talking points meant only to describe the characters or drive the plot, in the same way as dialogue in the comicbooks is delivered frame-by-frame and baloon-by-baloon for the same purposes. I believe that, if Lee knew (and loved) his source material better, he would have followed the Marvel writers who dealt with this limitation of their medium by inserting liberal amounts of action, humour, and romance to prevent the more esoteric stretches from being overlong. However, it does speak well of Lee's talent that he was perceptive and consistent enough in his innocence to translate the style of the dialogue so literally to screen, in addition to the obvious, comicbook-inspired scene transitions and split screens. (Unless I am misinterpreting as an artistic decision an inclination to use actors too much as tools to speak to the audience.) Personally, in Lee's place, I would have adopted the more standard approach by taking advantage of my medium with more naturalistic direction of my actors that depicted more casual interaction between the characters.I wanted more explanation of the genetics involved in the story - it is about scientists, after all. There is more technical detail about the U.S. military then the biology of the Hulk and his father. Danny Elfman's score, as usual from him, fitted and enhanced the action with some lively themes. The CGI was impressive to me as a computer programmer. There are some scenes where the expressions of compassion on Hulk's face show why live-action movies will be made with CGI stars in the future, as depicted in ""Simone"" last year. The acting was good. Nick Nolte, Sam Elliot, and the beautiful and graceful Jennifer Connelly were all superb. However, I think that Eric Bana was miscast and misdirected because he actually had too much personality and not enough self-repression, especially in his opening scenes in the lab, and especially for an introverted, dedicated, nerdy, 35-year-old academic. And I don't think that Nolte's character was written clearly enough. He should have been given more time to depict his motivations or have been deleted from the film altogether. *** SPOILERS *** His comment in his final tirade that he made about super-beings ""walking the earth before the pale religions of modern man"" interested me, but where did an obsessive genetic scientist get that from? If he loved his wife and son so much, why would he try to hurt the only thing he had left from his marriage after so tragically killing her? If it is because he is a power-mad scientist, why couldn't he just continue trying to guide and persuade his son instead of trying to take all the power himself? I think that this needs more explanation, other than the desire to see a climatic battle between super-powered father and super-powered son. And, despite the spectacular, artistically conceived, flying tackle through the clouds, the ending is weak because what happens to ""Energy Man"" is presented too quickly and with too little explanation.In a nutshell, ""Hulk"" is a mixed bag to me. I would give it less than 7/10 if it weren't for its interesting creative elements.",Hulk

They can't seem to keep a consistent size / scale to it as it interacts with the rest of the film setting and people.  It doesn't have any depth or realism to its textures and the colors are freakishly bad.  Have you ever seen a colorized western, where the dust of the cattle trail causes an un-natural glow to the 'assigned' skin and clothing colors?  Well, Hulk looks worse than that. There's really no excuse for such a bad CGI job. The creature was the whole point of making the film (well, after making money anyways).

The bright points were few and far between, although I thought both Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot turned in great performances, but theres only so much brooding Eric Bana one person can take. (He was so much better in Black Hawk Down)In the second half the Hulk fights some tanks, helecopters and jets. Jumps around a lot and is even carried into inner space.

My hope is that after this piece of garbage and the terrible Daredevil movie that hollywood doesn't wash their hands of comic books again, but it looks like the genre may be on the decline.

I was just about to think 'perhaps this will be pretty good,' when we were suddenly thrown into 40 minutes of confusing, overblown and disjointed plot. That really summarises the film as a whole. The action sequences were pretty good, building up a tempo, yet suddenly they were interrupted or cut with horrible multi-screen cinematics. The last 20 minutes of the film, are quite possibly the most frustrating moments of my life. The plot spiralled completely out of control and i found myself leaking brain matter everywhere.

Bill Bixby wasn't a person totally devoid of feelings (like Bana seemingly is) and therefor better to be indentified with. Oh and the reason not to wear biker-helmets: they make you look silly ! the only 2-dimensional character is Nolte (as Bruce's father), but that's probably because he was as new as the background story (which I didn't like). If I can suspent disbelief enough that the CGI-Hulk looked real and acted real, I would have also prefered the Gamma-bomb ""original"" beginning instead of a newer more believable story. Nick Nolte plays the deranged scientist well and him creating the Hulked up dogs is somewhat believable. Josh Lucas basically played an overdone Talbot. the scene where he tried to anger Bruce in the room in the militairy installation, even I would have punched him in the face though Bruce kept calm even when tortured with the ""cattle prod"". which for me was unbelievable, that was the whole point of the Hulk: Bruce couldn't control him when he got mad !Ang Lee wanted to create a tragic story about the Bruce Banner/Hulk with some action, but fails in my opinion on some points:1 the split screens, fine comic-book looking but when they aren't in action scenes (would have been a reason to see it again) they are overdone.2 the final battle ! the Hulk is it's own worst enemy the ""Absorbing man"" made it feel like he wanted a big splashy action-packed ending which was bad and too artificial comic-book like. Ending with the calming down scene with Betty (Jennifer Connelly)in San Fransisco would have been MUCH better.good things:seeing the Cameo's of Lou Ferringo (the cool looking Hulk from the TV-series) and Stan Lee (with lines) was great, to be honest I didn't notice Lou because I was looking at Stan Lee and was listening to what he had to say.the Hulk smashing ! the Hulk only fought back when attacked by the army and basically wanted to be left alone.I give it a 5,5 out of 10 stars not a bad film though it leaves much to be desired to be good. see it for yourself, but don't expect to much.",Hulk

Rather than a straight up live action comic book action adventure in the vein of the Spiderman or x-men films , ang lee has presented the hulk as an emotion driven art movie that happens to have a giant green monster in it . Its an ambitious attempt to add depth to a superhero movie ,and while its mind blowing in some places its not entirely successful. When the hulk does his trademark temper tantrums of mass destruction , its very entertaining to watch as he destroys tanks , mutant killer dogs and fighter jets .

There are a lot of revelations that occur in the story but the characters are so casually played that these plot developments are not as shocking and moving as they should be when they occur .As for ILMs hulk , all the money and complex development techniques used to create him was worth it to an extent - it does look amazing , but only from certain angles . Close up he looks as real and organic as every human actor in the film , but from a distance he looks a kind of video game character .Hulk is a very different kind of comic book movie ,that's of an acquired taste and while it wasn't the best way to interpret the comic in movie form , its definitely got some great ideas and its miles ahead of many a superhero flick in terms of artistic integrity .",Hulk

The story has no villains except for the dumbest thing they come up with, Bruce Banner's father who gets mutant dogs to kill his girlfriend. The only incredible Hulk I see is an emotional wreck. The father as another angry green giant is hardly seen, you can barely see him.

488,cmerrittphantom,Underrated masterpiece.,10,7 January 2018,"I don't call something an underrated masterpiece lightly. That's a bold claim, but I feel like this is necessary. Compared to the light and fluffy depiction of Banner and the big guy in the MCU these days, and especially compared to the safe, generic, boring Edward Norton flick, this movie is a deep and intimate journey through the breaking dam of latent rage.Ang Lee is one of my favorite action directors of all time. This movie is sharp, lucid, cognitive... everything in it builds to an effect. The bold split screen effects are more than just comic book emulation, they are confusion and discomfort of an overload of information. The editing in this movie is deliberately crafted to make viewers angry... which was a huge risk that didn't really pay off, because resisting it makes you uncomfortable and it's not really an aesthetically pleasing thing to behold without the effect. But surrender to it, and you really find yourself in Bruce Banner's head... lapses in imagery and real-time continuity, jumbles of information and incoherent panic. The cinematography is perfect and unlike anything else.The saddest thing about this film is Betty Brant's reaction to the monster, and Bruce Banner's dependence on her reaction. And that's really what this movie is about. Can Betty accept the rage and trust in something so wildly unpredictable? Logic versus heart. And Bruce is just lost within it. It's a sad story of helplessness.For a film ripe with sporadic editing, the pacing is rock solid. The tone is very, very deep into the terrifying uncertainty and vulnerability of the two lead characters. We see a relationship unfolding in the first act, focused on vulnerability, and then throughout the second act, we are subjected to experiments with and invasions of that vulnerability in its peak state... and in the third act it builds to a ferocious release of pure chaos.There's a strange sci-fi ending that feels a bit gratuitous, but as a cognition of the incoherent rage, it's cathartic and necessary. The ending of the relationship with Betty and Bruce is left ambiguous, which only makes the impact of the journey all the more potent.This film is a piece of art. The characters may not be charming or likeable, but they're sympathetic. And what little humor there is may be dry, but the true joy of this movie is seeing the beast unleashed. The action in this movie is ultra physical. It is no jumble of grays like the 2008 film, it is no comical joke like Avengers Hulk. It is a terrifying and kinetic rampage. It's a story that is a contradiction, both human and inhuman. It's a monster of a film.",Hulk

490,LordBling,Underwhelming,5,20 June 2003,"Ugh.If you're a comic book fan, you're gonna LOVE it.  If you're like most other human beings, you're gonna find a lot wrong with The Hulk.I think the reaction of the average kid will be mixed.  Some will like it for the visuals (when there are any), but I think most will be bored through most of it.  And some will be scared in a couple of parts.Eric Bana was decent, but largely boring in the film, and it won't help people to connect with his character any more than they already would (or won't).  Nick Nolte, Sam Elliot, and Josh Lucas all overacted more often than not.  Jennifer Connelly was solid, and the only positive on the acting front.The CGI was a mixed bag.  The first two times you see the Hulk, it's at night and there are a lot of close-ups, almost to obscure things ... was the CGI 100% completed?  Can't really tell in those.  But the desert scene is very well done ... although the running animation looked choppy.  And I have to agree with the Dallas Morning News ... ""He looked like a green Pillsbury Doughboy.""  Especially when he's being hit with bullets ... it looks less like muscles and more like a green ooze.  However, the entire desert battle was well-done, and should be what most people will refer to as their favorite part of the film.There are a few plot holes in the final act, and from two friends of mine who saw it last night (in different cities) both didn't think they were plot holes, mainly because they're big fans of the comic series, and they just knew who the ""Great Absorbing Man"" or whatever the hell he was called.  For most of us regular summer action Joes ... well, the final act is one big mess.  And the other problems I had with it will wait until you've seen it, as they are scene specific.For once, the early word on the internet was correct!  One of the early reviewers said, ""It won't matter what kind of prom dress they put on this pig...""So, two final ratings: Comic book fans - 3 and a half stars The rest of the filmgoing public - two starsI think the film will do between 75 and 80 million on opening weekend, because of the hype and the marketing has played to children more than they did in the beginning ... I mean, it looks cool to see him jumping miles and smashing.  But I think the word of mouth will be lukewarm, and that will hurt the business throughout the rest of the term, especially with Charlie's Angels 2 coming out next weekend.  A warning for the Hulk: Unless you count the over-acting, there is ZERO humor in it, so people will be ready for some humor to go with their action next week, and they'll also be ready for more action than thirty minutes out of a 138 minute film.  So I think it's gonna finish around 200 million, and not the 300 or 350 that some are predicting.",Hulk
491,sageaqua,Dying a unforgivable death (spoilers),4,3 July 2003,"Its to bad: 	For me the best part of the movie was the live action, and theextensive background information, and a number of nice looking shots.Over all it was well structured. 	The problems with the film is the CGI is garbage, no better then mostof today better computer games. and it varied a lot in the shoot.Perhaps the worse scene was the fight between the hulk and the mad dogsthat had been injected with the hulks DNA. The live action in thatportion of the film was fine, the CGI so bad that, I feel sorry theartists. and If I feel sorry for someone, its very bad as I make myliving judging Public Access TV and I tend to be indifferent to qualityand supportive of the artist in general. 	Their are times the film that it almost works. Either as a comic or asa film not both. I think I prefer the comic and the TV show, and I'mfilm producer. I just feel sorry for everyone involved. 	Some fairly good Comic book films, Unbreakable: is outstanding as aorigin story, but it often over looked. Daredevil  needed just a littlework to improve the story it looks good, I'd rate it better then theHulk at least. The Batman and Superman movies were good, Super girl andwonder woman films are better then the Hulk, and that's bad, becausenether are very good movies. And I like both films.

There were a few things that bothered me along the way but it didn't get in the way of the movie.  I thought that this movie ruled.  It was a billion times better than Spider-man.  Yes, I admit that there were times that the Hulk looked fake and you could tell he was CGI (I thought it was a lot more noticable in Spiderman . . .) but for the most I thought he looked really cool.  When I saw Spiderman I thought ""hmm that was cool but I was in no rush to see it again or to even get it on DVD.

494,Skorpyos,Worth this review...,4,20 June 2003,"Though I normally not write reviews of any kind, this movie just forced me to include a small note since the reaction it inspired in me was unique.  The movie was bad, quite bad.  The plot is simple and essenceless, the acting is inadequate, especially by the main character who reminded me of a psycho instead of a repressed person.  The CGI was overdone and made the movie look way too fake.  The confrontation towards the end was the stupidest ""battles"" ever and made no sense.  The whole movie is basically about this psycho who screams and throws tantrums and turns green.  Then he takes huge leaps from city to city (what??!) and fights with mutant dogs.  The main actress is only eye candy and her only purpose is to be the anti-depressant of the hulk.  I gave this movie a 4 and I am generous as after one hour into the movie I was falling asleep.  At the end of the movie people booed the film, not to forget the laughing when the hulk was jumping all over the world.   DON'T WATCH IT and I am a HUGE Marvel fan.  X-Men still rule!!",Hulk

From its score to directing this movie had it going on.  Being both a fan of the comic book and the TV series I can say this did justice for them both.  As for the Hulk him self.  I don't get where people are saying he looks to cartoonie.  In my opinion he looked just like he does in ninety percent of the comic books. CGI was the best it's ever been and better than that in the Matrix movies. This was one of the most visually stunning movies I have ever seen.  And I've seen a lot.

500,LeonardPine,Not perfect but rather underrated,8,7 April 2005,"The Hulk is far from perfect, but it does seem to get a rough ride from a lot of people. And as for people calling it, ""the worst movie ever made"", oh please, it's not even close.I'd commend Hulk for being an ambitious film. At least director Ang Lee has tried to do something different with a 'summer blockbuster', and for all it's faults there are a lot of pluses.Yes the film is to long with far to many 'character development' scenes that slow the film down. A lot of these scenes could have been cut without damaging the film. In fact the film is probably a half hour to long. I think if the film were 1 hour 40 minutes it would have been a much better movie. How about a shorter directors cut!I find the action scenes with The Hulk very enjoyable, and straight out of the comic book. The sequences where Hulk battles the army are the best in the film, and i loved the bit where he clings to the fighter jet! The climax is a huge disappointment as well as being confusing and at a time when the film has run it's course. It's never clear what Nick Nolte's character becomes or what he's trying to achieve.Still, worth checking out for all it's faults, and probably worth seeing again if you've only seen it once. The comic panel editing though skillfully done can get annoying, but the film does look superb and has a good score by Danny Elfman.",Hulk
501,Wasting-my-precious-time,Decent enough,9,31 July 2003,"I haven't seen a lot of Ang Lee's previous films. I caught ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and enjoyed it thoroughly. He seemed like a strong choice to helm the Hulk, or at least give the comic/hero genre a go. I can't say i was ever a big fan of the Hulk, before my time really but he never struck me as a real hero. The whole point was that his powers were a curse upon him and with that in mind i thought that Lee may be able to make a different kind of film.It started out well enough aside from a rather dissapointingly bland performance from Eric Bana. The rest of the cast is superb, Nick Nolte in particular. The story moves along swiftly and soon the Hulk is romping and stomping. The problems start when Lee tries bringing some of the comic book elements over to the screen too literally and a lot of the action just looks stupid, almost like it belongs in a parody.The films is well shot and edited toghether but half way through it feels like Lee is having something of personality crisis. One half is trying to inject a decent story with depth whilst another is trying to make it marketable to the kiddies. It was always going to be a struggle and with that in mind Lee deserves credit for his boldness.It's worth the price of admission in any case it's still one of the better films I've seen this year. Just don't expect your typical superhero film.",Hulk
502,SevenStitches,A Comic Book film with more brains than brawn.,6,23 June 2005,"It's been a while since i saw this film, way back when it first came out. I'm sure if i see it now my opinion might change. But two years isn't that long so i think i'll invest in this review.First off, marketing killed this film. I guess it was inevitable since how can you herald the big screen translation of the big green smashing machine without annunciating the action, which this film does have. But people missed a far bigger point integral to enjoying this film. The hulk is not a hero. He's more like marvel's King Kong, a magnificent beast that's misunderstood and taken advantage of by mankind. He's also the enraged alter ego of Bruce Banner, a nuclear scientist with a traumatised past dominated by his father who past on mutated genes to his son after an illegal experiment conducted by himself on himself. He murdered his wife (I think) and since then disappeared, until now, working as a janitor in Bruce's institute. Bruce gets exposed to a heavy dose of radiation after some gutsy heroics to save his comrade after an experiment goes wrong. The radiation has now triggered the mutated gene, causing him to turn a bit green when angry. Now the army want's him for his unique genes, as the hulk goes on the rampage.It's Bruce's troubled past and his relationship with his father that really puts oomph to the drama here, and sets up a truly harrowing final battle at the climax, which i'll leave you to enjoy. The rest of the film works too, with great special effects, good acting and action sequences. People have really been unfair to this movie's look, especially the hulk. I think he was great, considering the alternatives. Are there any? Guy in suit; limited mobility. Animatronics; yeah right! And we can't complain since who's really supposed to know what a super-sized green man beast is supposed to look like? I think this is the best hulk they could have possibly made and while not perfect (special effects almost never are), it was good enough for me. Spider-Man had the same problems, but people got through that. I also loved the film's comic book panel split screen work, which really made the scenes far more dynamic and allows you to see a scene from multiple perspectives. This film only has a handful of action set pieces, but all are fantastic and well paced. CGI fight scenes are usually a bit too synthetic, but they do good here, and since anger's the motivation it makes them that much more enjoyable. There are flaws however. Eric Bana is good as the mentally restrained Bruce, but seems a bit too suppressed and doesn't always succeed in selling the scenes. The first transformation into the hulk was supposed to look quite ominous and confused with it's dark setting, reflecting Bruce's confusion, but you see too much of him, which kinda makes it less ominous. But the next transformation makes up for it though, which becomes the first time you see the transformation properly. Finally there's a truly confused section just before the final fight, and just after the previous action set piece before it. It just stops the film in it's tracks for around 10 minutes, making me think it was going to end it was so solemn. I was prepared to be really disappointed, wanting the hulk to come back once again, or for at least some of the film's plot line to be resolved. This all came true in the end, but this section made it so inconsistent. But it did end well in the end though, so i looked past it.An underrated film that deserves a look from anyone who can keep an open mind. Hold your expectations back, just go with the flow. You might be pleasantly surprised.The film's poor box office success shouldn't retract from a more action packed sequel. It needs and deserves one. Don't't let us down universal!",Hulk

504,alexisbessonmackain,Unfairly rated,10,7 September 2018,"I have just finished watching the Hulk and I have previously watched the incredible hulk and his portrayals in the marvel cinematic universe. This is however the better of the two solo films because it has better acting, better music and better direction.
Good(other than the points stated above):
Visual effects are good, i do not see why everyone is complaining about the hulk
Less action but still good when it shows
Allows a wider narrative and more drama akin to another film, watchmen
Pacing is near perfect
A bleak tone helps to make this film relatable and realistic just like the dark knight trilogy only different as this is marvel
Overall, I think this film is one which has been unfairly rated on websites like metacritic and rotten tomatoes by audiences and unlike its complement of the same year, daredevil the film, deserves a chance to be seen by all.",Hulk
505,Craig87-1,Suspend Disbelief /Turn Up The Volume/Sit Back And Enjoy,6,10 September 2009,"First I have to say of the bat I collected the Incredible HULK comics as a kid, and am indeed a fan. A real disappointment was the fact that this is a 2 disc edition and yet has NO English SUBTITLES! There is quite a bit of technical jargon that begs for subtitles, so I ask WHY 2 discs and no English subtitles? Another fact remains, that, at least for me, it felt like there was a fully animated character running around a live action set. Sort of like ""Who Framed Roger Rabit"", without the humour. You really had to suspend disbelief. I especially liked the comic style editing, pure genius although a bit overused. . I also had a hard time with the origin alteration. No Bruce Banner throwing mindless hot rodder Rick Jones into a safety trench before the atomic blast, etc. BACK TO THE MOVIE...It took me about three viewings of the movie for it to finally settle in, and I must say this is a highly ambitious and likable film. Yes, it has it's faults and does ask a lot of demands of the audience, but having said that, it's a film that grows richer with repeated viewings, and as a true fan of the comic, I must say it's a MUST SEE for any true HULK fan. Let's hope, if a sequel is forthcoming, they correct the lugubrious tone and make it more fun for the audience. For the viewer, a movie shouldn't be work, it should be fun. It's time to put the INCREDIBLE back into THE HULK. Let's hope fans get another chance to see one of Marvel comics, most enduring tragic characters, get the movie he truly deserves.",Hulk

But for those of you who want to see something that goes beyond the traditional formulaic films so popular these days in America, you will find Hulk to be a blessing.

507,Opus-16,"bold, unique, intense",8,23 June 2003,"I debated with myself somewhat on whether or not I wanted to pay to see this in the theater due to the mixed reviews.  Now that I have actually watched it, I'm glad I didn't listen to the naysayers.  I can see why this is not some people's cup of tea, but I really got into it.  It is one of the most interesting moviegoing experiences I've had in some time.
The movie IS somewhat schizophrenic, the first half being broodingly intense and character driven, while the second half focuses more on straight action with even a little bit of humor thrown in.  I for one enjoyed both sides of its personality.  I think Danny Elfman's musical style, which I sometimes find somewhat annoying as in ""Men in Black"" fit extremely well in ""Hulk"". Ang Lee gets great performances from his lead actors as well.  I liked ""Crouching Tiger"" but didn't really see what all the fuss was about.  With this film, I can see why he is hailed as a visionary director.  The film itself is beautifully shot.  Lee's decisions and fingerprints are present and evident in every scene, but the techniques he employs are never overtly intrusive. He obviously experiments somewhat in this film, to good result in my opinion.  Love or hate what he does here, but you've got to admit to and admire the vision, determination, and just plain guts it took to make this film the way he did.As for the green guy, he is hit or miss.  In some scenes he feels so real you can almost feel his breath.  Others are laughable.  For the most part, however, I was able to accept the result and suspend my disbelief.  I felt for the big guy, and that's what counts in the end.",Hulk
508,atcalvary4477,Hulk ... ? maybe ... Incredible? ... not by a long shot,7,30 June 2003,"I'll start by saying that this movie gets a 6.5/10 ... Here's the breakdown ... What follows is the ""Bad News""1. This movie really has nothing for acting. First and foremost, who is Eric Bana? No, seriously, like, I've never seen this guy before. If you're going to try for a blockbuster movie, let's pick a blockbuster lead? I have a feeling we won't see much more of Mr. Bana after this.2. Why did Josh Lucas have such a small part? Why did Sam Elliott's part take him to the depths of dull? Neither of these actors, both far more capable than our leading man, were put to the highest of their potential.3. What was with the beginning of this movie? Flashback, flashforward, flash-to-middle-of-dream ... I mean, come on, I haven't seen that much jumping around since, well, EVER! Give us something to build off ... I left the theater still wondering where some of those scenes came from ... come on now ...4. The CG was ""incredibly"" overdone ... that's about all I have to say about that ...5. Ok, there is absolutely no reason this movie needed to be as long as it was ... cut out, oh, I dunno, the first HOUR of this movie and it probably would be much better.Ok, and now the ""Good News"" (AKA, the part that kept me awake)1. The scene with the destruction of the tanks was very cool (unfortunately, we saw that in the trailers)2. The dog fight (as CG as it was) was at least able to make me sit up a little bit from the slouch I was in.3. As small as his part was, Josh Lucas played a great villain (had his part been expanded, this well could be a 7.5 out of 10)4. This movie was released at the same time as the huge and sudden influx of comic book hero movies ... why is this good? Maybe it will be overlooked by the much more powerful X-Men movies ...Overall, this movie PROBABLY deserves less than what I'm giving it. However, I'm keeping this 6.5 because of one other reason; I believe that this movie, more than any of the other comic book movies, sought to keep a little piece of the comic books in the film. How so? Many of the scenes contained box-style viewing, a classic for fans of comic books. Though, at times, this was slightly annoying, it created a different viewing style that moviegoers aren't so used to. Furthermore, as little as I know about the original comic (hence, no comments were made about that above) I have heard that the movie was pretty true to its backing, a trait I greatly respect and like to see. Would I recommend running out to see this? No. But when it comes out on video, it might be worth the rental fee to check it out.6.5/10",Hulk
509,themanager,What a disappointment!,4,30 June 2003,"I waited for so long for this movie. Ang Lee directing a character that can give you incredible action, this had the potential of a classic. But what happened? Its the ""John Woo syndrome"" all over again! Great work in Asia but when the director is brought over to Hollywood the work is TERRIBLE. Just judging by this movie Ang Lee is better suited for cinematography NOT directing. Crouching Tiger built up the expectations SO HIGH, so the drop to the Hulk's level is HUGE. Mr.Lee seems totally lost in this movie, there is no angle to the story and the story is bad too. I don't know if Mr.Lee wanted this project or was it given to him but it feels forced.This movie is Resident Evil all over again and that's an insult.",Hulk
510,michaelflatley,A flawful movie,1,26 June 2003,"The movie is called ""The Hulk"".  But our superhero gets cheated as Bruce and Betty takes up most of the time in the movie.  The movie tries to be really serious, but how can it?  It is about the Hulk!  And to add more insult to its seriousness, the Hulk computer-generated character is unconvincing. Which leads us to the biggest flaw of all, bad CGI.  Although it made a valiant effort in new territory, making computer-generated humans look real is still a long road ahead.  The Hulk does not look real.  He is very silly when he is with real humans since he stands out like Roger Rabbit.  During scenes when he fight with other CGI creatures, it looked like a video game. Because he looks so fake and stands out from everyone else, you don't really feel for him since he is not perceived to be real.  Perhaps they should use a wax Hulk next time.  Wax statues can fool me sometimes, but not CGI humans.",Hulk
511,lifeinaslan,GREAT,9,20 June 2003,"The Hulk is probably the best Comic book movie ever made (around the Midst of X2). It is more like a comic book than any other comic book based film ever. The Cameras are absolutely wonderful, the unique shots keep you watching and wondering what happens next. At times yes the visual effects could have been better, but that means they would have to spend 4 years on it like the Star War films, for just under two years of production the Hulk looks great. Most of the Scenes are overwhelming. Great Acting, Superior Direction (especially for a comic book film). Entertaining Action and Adventure, and best of all dark emotions. There is emotion in this film which propels this film. (this is where Spider-Man lacked). Overall: 9/10. One star off due to some of the visual effects. Everything else is top notch.",Hulk
512,mssandlin,"A great comic book movie, but the ending stunk. (Spoilers)",8,26 June 2003,"This movie had a really original feel to it.  The acting is pretty good all around, and the fact that they didn't tone down Nolty's mad scientist dialouge is commendable.  I love the comic panel scenes, and the CG is great especially during the dog fight.  I would have rated this movie a nine or even possibly a ten if it weren't for the ending.  Somehow, the same gama ray exposure that made Bruce Banner huge and green made his father, David, into ""Absorbing Man"" aka God.  Then, the army, which up till now has been literally dying to kill Bruce Banner and his father, allow them to have a moment together.  Then when they see that Bruce is getting angry, instead of frying him, they twiddle their thumbs and allow his father to bite into a power line (yes that's right, he BIT into a power line). This allowed him to turn into lightning and carry the Hulk around.  He wants the Hulk's power (though why a person who can turn into lightning and ""absorb all ambiant energy around him"" needs to be able to turn big and green is beyond me. 
This ending is one of the all time movie blunders, and the problem is that it comes at the end of a really great movie.  I'm really upset because when I think about the film I don't remember any of the wonderful scenes (there were tons of them).  All I really remember is a big lightning fist carrying the Hulk through the air (I'm still unclear how lightning can grasp a person and carry them through the air)while David Banner's face flashes in the cloud.  I plan on buying the DVD and turning it off after the scene where Hulk reverts into Bruce after the San Francisco rampage.  You should do the same.",Hulk
513,aziffle13,"Why? Why? Why? I don't know but, Stan Lee owes me $4.50!",2,23 June 2003,"Okay maybe Stan Lee owes me $2.25 and Ang Lee owes me $2.25 but someone definitely owes me the price of that ticket back. Why? I'm not sure that I know where to start. Stan Lee should be ashamed of himself for allowing a Marvel Comics icon to be treated so poorly. Ang Lee should be sorry for spending nearly an hour to tell the `origin'. I'm sorry but, if I go to see a big green computer generated creature in a movie I don't want to wait an hour for him to emerge from the plot to smash something!I will admit that I am a bit of a comic book person but I also understand that certain changes are made when the character makes the jump from the comic page to the big screen. Spider-man, X-Men, Daredevil, Blade, Blade II, and X2 are all examples of good to great comic book based movies in spite of and in some cases because of changes made from the original comic books. That being said I knew they departed from the 1960's comic book ""exposure to radiation from a gamma bomb test while saving Rick Jones who happened onto the test site"" origin. I was prepared because I had heard they were changing the origin. What I wasn't prepared for was the length of the setup or the fact that they were going to try to play this like some Greek tragedy. Maybe I'm simple minded here but, establish the fact that he's really a good guy and give us an origin in the first 15 to 30 minutes (at most) and get on with action, establishing the villain, action, story-line, and some more action with a pinch of romance thrown in for good measure.Spoilers ahead!The origin was convoluted but understandable. The villains of Glen Talbot (an under developed character) and David Banner (the deranged father) never hit the mark with me. Talbot was evil but they never really developed your distaste for him enough before diving in with him. David Banner on the other hand they developed and developed and never could really decide what they wanted him to be; was he evil, deranged, misguided, or all of the above. His mutated hell hounds where laughable in appearance, as were his superpowers that came into play late in the film. There was no real explanation as to why his powers were so different than those of his son's despite the similarity in how they came about. The scene where General Ross brings the father and son together in shackles and Nolte's character flips out actually caused several theater patrons (myself included) to laugh out load.
No one can explain the cloud-to-cloud jumping by the lightening version of David Banner and the Hulk. Okay so the lightening character can do that but how does the Hulk tag along?  Also, what is with the bubble containing both characters that is exploded near the end of the movie? How and why did it form?Not to mention the silliness of the size of the Hulk in certain scenes, the lack of a sense of humor throughout, the ridiculous outline view of Talbot as he explodes, the endless departures from everything that was the Hulk in comics, and the seemingly impossibility of making much of the movie very boring.Finally, someone needs to exhume Jack Kirby and reline his coffin as I'm sure it is shreaded from the barrel rolls he has been doing over the treatment of one of his characters.",Hulk

516,0rbita1,Ang Lee is both the film's blessing and curse...,6,5 August 2003,"'The Hulk' is the most interesting and original approach to a 'Hollywood blockbuster' that I've watched in a long time. It's also the most problematic and for that you can thank Ang Lee, who a certain webslinger would call both the film's blessing and curse.'Hulk' looks stunning - some typical art cinema symbolic shots, others so beautiful you want to frame them. Even the action sequences - which, despite the Hulk's much criticised CGI are great - have a real poetry in their rhythm. A lot of comic-style screen wipes and camera zoom-outs as well as split screen techniques to try and establish pace too. Also, this is FAR more character and psychologically-driven then any blockbuster I've watched before. You really feel for the Banner/Hulk character - a real feeling of pathos and tragedy surrounds him (Lee pays homage to the original Frankenstein at one point with a scene by a pool and the 'tragic monster' similarities are plain throughout).The problem is that you also expect certain things of a comic book film and you can't help but feel that Lee struggled to compromise himself for the audience that 'Hulk' will appeal to. That's to be applauded at one level - but, at another, it made it a distinctly uneasy mix. The film is almost uniformly downbeat in tone and, when Ol'green skin doesn't appear for the first 45 mins, it becomes a little gruelling despite setting up some fine melodrama. Also, the rhythm is of the film is uneven because the Hulk sequences are so energised up to the rest of the film. The fancy editing and techniques talked about above are used in strange places sometimes - they're refreshing but whether they add to the film's 'feel' is questionable.Overall, you have to applaud Ang Lee for attempting what he has - it works on some levels and it's astonishing that he had the artistic freedom to do it (you can clearly see where the 'Hollywood' stops and Ang Lee starts). But the mix is also a problematic one as its far less 50-50, more 75-25 in favour of Lee and it is easy to see why audiences have had real trouble with accepting it. Personally, I hope he gets the sequel - am sure that, with mainstream action practice now under his belt, he could refine it to be an absolute classic film. But I dunno if studios will take the chance again. A valiant effort, but flawed masterpiece or interesting failure? Hard to tell.",Hulk

518,Anijo,The incredible  Freud?,4,6 November 2007,"I think that 'Hulk' suffers from the same problem as some other recent sci-fi films, like 'The Core'. Instead of accepting that these kind of stories is all about fantasy & giving the audience a fun thrill ride, they try like maniacs to anchor them in reality & waste half the time on excessive talking & presenting ""plausible"" scientific explanations. Anybody with knowledge about this genre knows that such mumbo jumbo never makes the audience connect more, it totally works against its purpose. So it's a mystery to me that movie makers who are able to spend millions of dollars on their productions continually fail to understand basic facts about good screen writing.In 'Hulk' the back story is presented very quick in the beginning, which I thought was good, but unfortunately this does not lead into a fun & fast paced action movie. Instead it almost comes to a full stop for about 40 minutes that is filled with romantic nonsense & lots of psychobabble. And when the action finally starts to unfold the development is still very slow, and it's only in the last half hour this really feels like a movie about the incredible Hulk. So once again we see that Freud, real world science & comic book characters don't mix well. Sorry Ang Lee, watch 'Blade II' & better luck next time.",Hulk
519,Comiccritic83,The best Marvel Comics based film of '03 could've been better,8,22 June 2003,"Warning! Warning! This review is spoiler heavy! If you haven't seen the film, don't read this review!Still with me? Good. Here's my review...We all know the deal of the Hulk, mainly due to the 1970's Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno series: ""Don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry."" This isn't like the '70's series, and that's both a good and bad thing.Dr. Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is adopted by Mr. (not seen) and Mrs. Krenzler after his birth parents are thought dead when he's only 4 years old. The truth is more darker. After being bombarded by nano-meds and gamma radiation while saving his assistant, Harper (Kevin Rankin), in a lab, Bruce later learns of his real last name from his alive-and-well psycho father, Dr. David Banner (Nick Nolte, who earns most of the praise on the part of the film's live-action actors -- and looks eerily like his drunk driving mug shot to a tee). David tells Bruce he's unique and that he passed on a genetic imperfection to Bruce after he tried experiments on himself, which enabled him to survive the accident.And by ""unique"", I mean that Bruce turns from repressed scientist to a 15-foot, green-skinned man-monster with a knack for mood swings and smashing things up real good.Bruce finds comfort and support of his new condition with his co-worker and on-again, off-again love interest, Dr. Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly, who is as talented as an actress as she is charming and beautiful).But he's also hounded by three people -- his dad, David, who has some gamma-irradiated dogs to help his cause; Glenn Talbot (Josh Lucas), who wants to not only steal away Betty from Bruce and exploit the good doctor's research, but harness the Hulk's genetic power as well; and finally, Betty's own father, General Ross (perfectly played by Sam Elliott). General Ross locked away Bruce's dad when David murdered his wife and tried to kill Bruce, and wants to stop the Hulk's rampages -- at any cost. He also doesn't want Bruce to be anywhere near his daughter, either.And when David Banner uses gamma rays on himself to become powerful in his own right, with the ability to mimic anything he touches (a la Crusher Creel/the Absorbing Man, a Hulk villain from the comics), but with no green, the Hulk winds up fighting his own dad in a duel to the death (gee, guess who wins?).Anyway, the C.G.I. (computer generated image) Hulk isn't very effective and Lou Ferrigno did a better job when he played the Hulk. The C.G.I. looks fair, which is the one thing I usually criticize about a film, whether leaping away 3 miles in a single jump, pounding a tank in a fight sequence or his tender facial expressions when seen smitten with Betty. But the C.G.I. Hulk looks like a Playstation character (and he gets a mere two lines in the film -- ""Puny human"" in a dream sequence and ""Take it all!"" in the final fight).However, the Hulk isn't a good Marvel film as, say, Fox's first ""X-Men"" or Columbia's ""Spider-Man"" films. This psychodrama isn't for everyone to watch and enjoy (granted, that's the premise of the Hulk in the comics, but two hours and fifteen minutes worth?). Its violence and disturbing images (like a seeing a frog exploding in a lab trial) isn't suitable for some to watch. It also isn't appropriate for kids, parents (like when Hulk makes a ""Hulk-dog"" explode into green powder from a punch in one of Hulk's berserker rages -- it IS rated PG-13 for a reason). And the film's ""what the heck?!?"" cliffhanger ending makes you wonder not only how certain characters got to where they are, but why they chose to end the film like that.And brief partial nudity, my foot -- you see ALL of Banner's bare rear as he staggers to Betty's car after the Hulk-dogs fight.The look is also confusing because of its comic book-like panels. It's cool in concept, but seeing multiple images of the same sequence can come off confusing, and some still images (like the death of a main character during an explosion) of shocking moments can come off unintentionally comical.And even the music by my favorite composer, Danny Elfman, could've been better. However, to be fair, Elfman was hired less than two months before the film's release to do the music, so I'll count it up as a default complaint due to rushed time. Still, some of the woman's vocals during some of the score not only distracts Elfman's good music, but the tone of the film as well. It's like Ang Lee hired Elfman if only he could have some ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-like themes to it.Also, in the comics, Bruce's full name is Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, but he's called Bruce. The ""Robert"" part of his name is M.I.A. in the film. And he doesn't start off as a gray-skinned behemoth when he first turns into the Hulk after the gamma rays exposure, like in the comics (in the second issue of the ""Hulk"" comic, Hulk gets his emerald skin due to exposure by cosmic rays, if I recall correctly).Still, despite nit-picks, ""Hulk"" is one of the best films I've seen this year, and is head and shoulders -- literally -- above this year's other two Marvel films, February's ""Daredevil"" and the debut of ""X2"" this May, both by rival company Fox.While I yearn to see the sequel, I hope to see a better, more clever, action-packed and more appropriate ""Hulk 2"".'Nuff said.",Hulk
520,teddeman,"You wouldn't like me when I'm angry, i.e. the way I felt leaving the theater.",3,17 June 2003,"Wow, what a let down.  A great director and the magic of Industrial Light and Magic didn't stand a chance against a horrible screenplay.  The audience and I that were ""lucky"" to see this advance preview should have realized something was amiss when Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno showed up in a cameo 15 minutes into the film.  Unlike a Hitchcock's cameo, which allows the viewer to focus on the film, this was the first coherent element in a meandering plot.  It was the first, and one of the only things in the film that made any sense.The action sequences were great, nothing compared to the Matrix 2, but still very impressive.  The problem was that by the time the action sequences happened the audience and I were practically in a coma.  The Matrix had its slow times as well (everything leading up to Neo clobbering agent Smith with the concrete post anchor) but at least I was looking forward to where the story was leading me.  I found myself looking around the theater in disbelief that there were 500 other people suffering through this madness with me.  So many of the scenes seemed to just go nowhere.  It was a shame because there was some very interesting editing lost in the story's shortcomings.Ang Lee created a filmic comic book with multiple, simultaneous camera angles.  This technique was changed from that of the TV show ""24"" by enclosing the multiple shots with comic book frames and scrolling them off the screen.  It made you feel like you were reading a comic book and was a unique transition tool.You can have too much of a good thing though.  The comic book font ""One Year Later"" blurb at the end of the film drew reactions of anger and disgust from the audience.  These emotions were masked with that confused laughter one uses when they are in shock at the ridiculousness they are witnessing. Spoiler??  I don't think the following is, but you may stop reading now just to be safe...
There will be another Hulk movie and Bruce Banner will still warn you not to make him angry.  He and the films producers should heed his own advice. If you really want to play it safe, stay home and read a comic book instead.",Hulk
521,ronaldotheheel,What Went Wrong?,3,21 June 2003,"Ok, let's look at the advantages of the movie (that's possibly the wrong word):--Ang Lee directing--A great lineup of actors like Jennifer Connely and Nick Nolte--Cutting Edge CGI--Music from my favorite composer, Danny Elfman--A Stan Lee cameo as well as Lou FerrignoAdded on to all of the above, I'm also a huge fanboy. Ever since I saw it last night, I've been contemplating why I didn't like this film. Though I'm still not quite sure, I think it might have had a little bit to do with those constant split screen techniques constantly going on. Sure, maybe it worked for two seconds, but then it just got annoying. If I wanted multiple angles, I would have gone and rented Timecode. I also think it might have been due to the graphic violence. This sounds really wierd because it all seems just as bad as something like any of the other comic films. I think especially when {{SPOILER}} he sucker punched that dog in its unmentionables. Actually I'd say that whole scene was too much. {{END OF SPOILER}} I guess the last possible way to contemplate it is that it was just plain BORING. The Hulk comic is a pretty basic concept. A guy gets mad and turns into a green goliath. But in the movie they made it more complicated than it had to be. Ang Lee attempted to make the movie more like an actual comic, but the problem is I don't think he's actually read too many comics in his life. Incidentally, he didn't catch the mood too well. Overall, I'd just suggest this as a rental.3/10",Hulk
522,jack_horner01,Hulk smash! Ang Lee destroy!,7,30 June 2003,"First off. Better than Spider-man, not as good as Daredevil, on par with X-Men 1 and 2, not a scratch on Batman, a little under Spawn, and crushed by Superman. If you do not like any of the films i have said the Hulk not as good as, then go and see it. If you agree with the films i enjoyed, then go and see Hulk any way.Good to see that Ang Lee has used the comic book for basis, and not the TV show. Don't get me wrong. I loved the show. But the film needs to be a comic book adaptation. So all you people saying, (IN WHINING VOICE) ""Why is he 12 feet tall?"" keep it shut.I am not too sure i liked the transitions. Lee draws too much attention to them, thus retracting from the film and withdrawing the fantasy element. If you want people to belive what they see, they need to become one with the world they are viewing. Using silly comic transitions will take away from that.I think we should have had a bit more Hulk for our money. Despite the fact that i would love to sit and watch Jennifer Connelly play sexy scientist for two hours, it is the big green beast that i have come to see.Apart from Nick Nolte, most of the acting is very wooden. There is alot, of what i call, porno dialogue. Sentences seem to be written and spoken in a very abnormal way, the actors do not seem comfortable saying them. The scenes become very un-natural. However, saying that, nothing i have seen in ages compares to the famous Banner line said in another language. I actually yelled out in joy, after reading the subtitles. I cannot believe that Ang Lee made us wait until the final moments of the film to hear Banner say it. But it is definately worth the wait. I think he says it in Columbian.The major problem with this film is that it is a spectical. The CGI, the silly fighter jet scene, the pathetic battle scene at the finale. These are all heavily reliant on the audience being wowed. There is no sense of reason behind them (Obviously, Lee has been watching the Matrix Reloaded too much).The film is a good attempt at re-inventing a slightly confusing comic book character (what is the Hulk's actual purpose?). However, it falls slightly short and becomes just another Hollywood flopbuster.3 and 1/2 out of 5",Hulk
523,Kingveggeta87,"Hulk excells in Effects, but sadly, story is slow...",1,23 June 2003,"As the title suggests, The Hulk motion picture turned out to be loaded with plenty of excellent special effects, but the story needed a huge pick up. Sure Eric Bana, Jennifer Connley(sorry if I misspelled her last name.), and Nick Nolte make a great on-screen trio, but not even their excellent acting could make up for the slow paced story. Sadly, I don't think that a sequel will be possible, unless this movie really racks up good bucks. But all that aside, the fully digital Hulk really stuck out as the best part of the movie. The way he smashed up everything and anything, including the ""Mutant French Poodle"", was enough to keep me hooked. See the movie, but don't expect much.",Hulk
524,derekblake,Most Confusing Film Award,3,14 January 2011,"One of the worst Super Hero films I have seen in a long time. The opening scenes are confusing and difficult to watch because of the use of 'Picture-in-Picture' techniques, often using the same scene shot from different angles. The earlier storyline is fragmented but does come together later in the film, I really lost interest because of this but pushed on to the end. Too many scenes seem to have been shot in almost total darkness and it was impossible to see what was going on during these times (which were many) especially the fight with dogs, this was almost completely lost to me. The sound also was lacking and much of the dialog passed by as the actors growling at each other, this was especially true of Mr. Banner Senior whose voice was so low that a subsonic converter should have been used instead of a microphone. The CGI of the Hulk was poor and unconvincing. As you may have detected I really enjoyed the film.",Hulk

I'll always have fond memories of the 1978 television show, ""The Incredible Hulk,"" so it was with a bit of trepidation I wondered how this movie could improve upon the transformation of the diminutive, Bixby into his alter-ego, the Hulk, played by Lou Ferrigno. Fear not, as technology is wonderful and with the aid of computer graphics, Bana's strapping 6'4 frame bulks to ungodly proportions! Nick Nolte, cast as ""David Banner,"" would not have been my first choice to play Bruce Banner's father, but if the director was going for the ""mad"" scientist look, then Nolte was right on target...he was definitely scary looking! Jennifer Connelly, as Bana's love interest was just a perfect mixture of brains and beauty-with a heart after all! Probably the two most memorable parts of this movie were the scenes focusing on the HULK's eyes...it brings tears to my own eyes just recalling this, and the scenes of the down-sizing...INCREDIBLE!Overall, this movie was fun and leaves the audience just primed for a sequel.",Hulk

I enjoyed the helicopter battle out in the desert, but everything else was just boring.  I'm all for character development (which I felt Spiderman was completely lacking), but there is little or none of it here.  Just endless, droning dialogue.I don't think enough was made of the fact that as he gets more angry, the Hulk gets more powerful.  I've read that the Hulk once lifted an entire mountain, but here he just plays with tanks and has trouble killing a few mutant dogs.  When I think Hulk, I guess I just think bigger.  Like Hulk vs. 200 tanks, not 3 or 4.  Or Hulk vs. a squadron of fighter jets, not just 2 or 3.  Too bad.",Hulk

I found that it was a painfully slow build up to any action, with nothing of any interest going on. When 'The Hulk' did appear I just could not give it any credibility at all, to me it looked like a huge computer generated green monster. Yes I know the TV series had a man painted green, but I was quite young :) I still found it far more believable than what this film had to offer. To be honest I normally try to find something positive about most films, but to be honest, the only thing that was positive about this film was the fact that it ended. TRULY AWFUL",Hulk
528,andy_krysiak,A great example of how you shouldn't make a Marvel movie,2,17 April 2016,"I honestly cannot believe I am reviewing this. I absolutely believe this is one of the worst comic book adaptations ever, so I just hate talking about it. But here we go anyway.This movie came out around the time when superhero movies were just starting to become a popular thing, but also long before they basically dominated Hollywood. Ang Lee's Hulk is a terrible movie mixed in among good comic book movies of its time like Spider-Man and X-Men. I understand how one may at the time have been impressed by the movie's special effects. Today, however, they are really un-special effects. The enormous (For real, he's, like, REALLY big, bigger than he should be) Hulk looks so fake in this movie, almost to the point where you feel like you're watching a Pixar movie whenever he's on the screen. No, that's not an insult to Pixar. They make good movies. ""Hulk"" is not a good movie. There is a scene in this film in which Hulk fights a bunch of CGI monster-poodles. Yes, you read that sentence correctly. CGI monster-poodles. No, we don't want a Hulk movie where Hulk battles good villains like Abomination or The Leader. Hulk will fight radioactive, retarded dogs... wow, Ang Lee, thanks for that one. In this scene, the most WTF part is the fact that Hulk kills all of these dogs, and when he does, they---get ready for it--- disappear in a cloud of green puff. Green puff. I want to say so many bad things right now... ugh.This movie calls back to Hulk's comic book roots. Because it actually looks like an effin' comic book. For those who have never seen this film, I tell you that the scene transitions have awkward panels that come off as being really cheesy and laughable. There is a death of a character in this movie whose death on screen is so terrible, it is just hilarious. This is because they choose a comic-book-ish style to display the death, probably to maintain their PG-13 rating because a more realistic representation of this character's death would be too gruesome and R-Rated. So yeah, this movie just looks so fake and unbelievable.Oh, and I should probably mention that this movie is super long and so boring. The film gives you absolutely no reason to care about the characters. It tries to be emotional and it just comes off as bland. The characters are so dramatic and stupid, you just don't feel any sympathy towards any characters in the movie. There is just a palpable feeling you have that none of the cast wanted to be on set to make this movie. And that makes sense, because I am just going to say the two words that describe this movie the best: It sucks.For anyone who hasn't seen ""Hulk"", I actually recommend that you watch it. But not for its so-called ""emotional"" aspects. Watch it with a bunch of your friends and get a good laugh out of it. Because it's bad. I am really trying to stress this: IT IS TERRIBLE. It's a shallow boring mess that tries to be melodramatic but instead will leave you laughing. From how bad it is, of course, not because it's humorous. I think Hulk spends more time staring at moss than he does doing cool Hulk things. And I guess I could have just told you that sentence and that would have represented my feelings as good as this entire review did.Rating: D-",Hulk
529,jjsledge-95899,The Hulk movie that never should have been,3,8 March 2019,"This is up for the worst Marvel movie of the ""modern era"". While not a part of the MCU, it was made trying to capitalize off the success of the Spider-Man trilogy success. Only decent part is the Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno cameo as security guards.The first issue ""Hulk"" faces is the storyline. A good chunk of the movie's early stages and latter stages involves Bruce's dad, who is more or less one of the villains. There is way too much backstory that takes kills the movie at the start. There's not really a flow to the story. It starts with young Bruce, then basically jumps to college, then jumps to adult Bruce. Once it hits the ""main story"", it jumps around way too much.The second issue is the cinematography and score. The movie has way too much of an artistic style for a comic book movie. I assume they were trying to make it somewhat like a comic book. But it just makes you dizzy. The CGI Hulk looks nothing like Eric Bana. It looks like Hulk is almost of Asian decent. The score makes no sense. It borders on copying ""The Lord of the Rings"" soundtrack at times and almost has an Egyptian/Middle Eastern vibe, despite being set in California and Arizona. An action movie needs an upbeat soundtrack, not awkward vocals.The last issue is the acting. Eric Bama was not the right choice for Hulk/Bruce. He doesn't command the screen. Josh Lucas clearly doesn't know how to play a power hungry character. It's laughable how ""hard"" he tries to go after the Hulk.Sadly, Marvel and Universal went all in on this. This is the Hulk movie that may have led to the roller coaster. Fortunately, Edward Norton saved the character in that later ""The Incredible Hulk."" However, he also killed the character by wanting too much money and forcing Marvel to change once again to political nutcase Mark Ruffalo.",Hulk

534,roadrunn,Worse than bad,3,1 July 2003,"In a nutshell, Ang Lee can't direct, the film is poorly photographed, terribly edited and no one can act except Nick Nolte.   One of the great things about the TV series was that Bruce Banner (Bill Bixby) was a very appealing character and you got to know him and his ideas.  In this film Eric Bana can't act, and you never get know Bruce Banner, at all.  Even Bruce Banner doesn't get to know Bruce Banner.  He doesn't even know he's Bruce Banner until three-quarters of the way thought the film, if that.This film is filled with a lot of rage (not including all those in the audience watching it and wanting their money back).  Almost every character is extremely angry, except Jennifer Connelly who plays the same type of subdued (or should I say somnolent) role she did in `A Beautiful Mind.'The movie is extremely incoherent down to the amateurish and lose-end directing of Ang Lee.  He makes several film-school mistakes that take the audience out of the narrative, little that there is of it.  The first thirty minutes are worthless, and should have been cut and replaced by 45-seconds of narrative exposition.  There's so little development with the villain, his demise is anti-climatic.This film just isn't good.  Save your money and see Finding Nemo, again.",Hulk
535,sorrow,Excellent movie,9,21 June 2003,"I am a long time fan of the Hulk and a movie buff. I have fond memories of both the comic book and the TV show from my childhood. When I first heard that Ang Lee would be directing and that the Hulk would be CGI, I had mixed feelings. I thoroughly enjoyed Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and knew him to be a talented director, but a CGI Hulk sounded frightening to me as I felt CGI artists were still far away from being able to pull off human-like characters.I can pleasantly say that my fears had no basis in reality.Ang Lee has crafted a fine film and the CGI is convincing enough to work well. The Hulk is very impressive to watch and his close ups show a wonderful range of emotion. Watch for the scene early in the film where Nick Nolte's character first sees the Hulk. The emotion shared between Nolte's character and the CGI Hulk here is amazing and beautifully touching. That is not to say that the CGI is flawless, but it works for the most part and is a bold step forward in good CGI work - an area that will only make further improvements when directors such as Lee, Lucas, and Jackson with the necessary financial backing can push the animators to break previous limits. With the CGI discussion out of the way, I can now safely discuss the movie itself.Hulk is an intelligent and moving drama and is the first comic book movie in quite some time that can fit comfortably in the same league as classics like Superman, Superman 2, and Batman. Like Hulk, these films were simply good movies that happened to be about a comic book character. Unfortunately, Hulk may prove too mature and cerebral for much of the core audience that is attracted to big blockbuster action films. For example, there is a scene where after the Hulk has reverted back to Banner, where we briefly glimpse Banner nude from behind and several people in the audience laughed, demonstrating the maturity of 6 year olds. Such a crowd may not be able to enjoy a serious film with actual character development, symbolism, and themes, but will alas find that they have stumbled into such a film with the Hulk rather than the mindless action feast that perhaps they were hoping to find.Don't expect to see the Hulk until well into the film. Lee takes his time as an expert storyteller and develops the film's central characters so that we can understand and care for them. All the acting is top-notch. Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly have a nice and tragic chemistry (much better than Spiderman's Peter Parker and Mary Jane which IMO felt artificial and sappy) as the two lovers who have been separated by Banner's emotional distance and then later by his Hulk condition. Nick Nolte is creepy and fascinating as Banner's father and towards the end equally tragic though not as sympathetic. Sam Elliot is perfect as the fiery General Ross who wants to protect his daughter, but has come become a stranger to her through his overzealous attempts to keep her from danger. Also, I would greatly commend the actors who played younger versions of Nolte and Elliot's characters as well as whoever found and cast them. Not only do they perform admirably, but also they are spitting images of what I'd imagine the younger versions of the characters to look like.The script nicely blends the classic origins of the comic book Hulk with a few new twists for a modern audience as well as the psychological underpinnings of the excellent storylines involving Banner's father and his past from Peter David's run as writer for the Hulk in the 80's. It is a thoughtful script that explores such classic and universal archetypes as the conflict between father and son while examining the ethics of genetics research and the nature of the military.Lee goes to great pains here to give us a stylized film as well. The film features a very nice technique where multiple angles of a scene dynamically shift and play across the scene at once creating an energized feel that helps recreate the comic experience on film. It takes some getting used to at first, but ultimately it enhances the film and gives it a very distinctive feel.And yes, there is a lot of action in the film as well. Once the Hulk is unleashed and becomes a hunted creature, we a thrust into the territory of King Kong and other great misunderstood beasts. Hulk definitely delivers some stunning action sequences that should delight the inner child that appreciates sheer awe and spectacle. This is the REAL Hulk as comic book fans know him. When you see the Hulk take on the army in this film, you'll see why no painted `puny' human can play the Hulk.I thank Ang Lee and all the cast and crew for bringing us an intelligent film that takes itself seriously and delivers the goods as both a compelling drama and a spectacle. Viewers who enjoy good movies will find a rewarding experience here, while people looking for a simple thrill-ride should try something else instead.",Hulk
536,FunkMcLovin,Not your typical summer blockbuster/comic adaptation,8,20 June 2003,"When you go to see a summer blockbuster in the movie theater, you pretty much have an idea of what you are going to see before you get through the opening credits. Usually, you are in for good special effects, pretty good acting, and a lot of action. Things usually explode, people die, and when you leave, you are not totally fulfilled. The Hulk, from the start, sets out to do the opposite of what you would expect from a comic book turned movie with a $150 million budget. Sure, you have your gratuitous action scenes where things explode and people die, but you get a whole lot more. This movie is all about the story of Bruce Krensler/Banner and his father and Betty Ross and her father. We learn a lot about why the characters are the way they are today. There are a lot of emotions and excellent acting. Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot in particular, shined with their performances. If there is one problem with this movie, it is that it is too smart and sensitive for its target audience. It is probablyh not action-packed enough to please the scores of young children and teenagers who just want to see things blow up.Ang Lee should be commended for this movie, as I am sure there were plenty of people at Universal Pictures that fought with him over his vision of this movie. He went out and made this story his own and succeeded in blending an action/comic movie with a dramatic picture. In addittion, his work of the split screens was trememdous, adding an extra element to the comic book feel.Overall, this is a very good movie, but suffers a little bit in the same way that the original X-Men did. There is a lot of story to tell and both of these movies were not made to stand by themselves; they were treated as the first movie in a series of movies. X2 was significantly better than the first, as would a second installment of The Hulk, if it does indeed come to fruition. I give this movie a very good 7/10, with room for improvement in a sequel.",Hulk
537,bcorse,The Hulk as he was meant to be!,10,22 June 2003,"I agree with those who say this movie is not for everyone, but not due to any fault in the movie itself.  Ang Lee has presented a brilliant, undistilled version of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's original vision, and it is breathtaking to watch.Unlike other Marvel characters, the Hulk was conceived as a tragic character, almost gothic in his original incarnation which dates all the way back to 1962.  The 70's TV show was good in its own way, but often substituted melodrama for real pathos.  IMHO no director but Ang Lee could have rendered this vision so accurately or so vividly, yet remain true to the essence of the characters and the story.  And yes, Sam Elliott is perfect as ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, and Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly nail their parts as well.Parents beware:  this is NOT a kid's movie!  It is very intense, and some scenes are truly frightening, so leave the little ones at home.",Hulk
538,kaessner,"Green, mean, and different...Cool!",8,20 June 2003,"WARNING! MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! LOOK AWAY IF YOU WANT TO BE SURPRISED, BUT KEEP READING IF YOU DON'T (OR HAVE ALREADY SEEN IT)!The Hulk turned out to be a curiosity more than anything for me. Sure, I love action movies like I love ice cream. It's just my genre of choice. But before actually seeing The Hulk, I had some serious doubts. Part of that skepticism arose when I saw the first previews, revealing the hero as a bastardization of the comic character. The CGI was what worried me the most, considering my favorite action movies tend to tone down on such fake effects. The only incentive which really drew me to this movie (honest to God) was Connelly. If that was all I was looking for, I was in trouble.Luckily, now that I have seen the movie, I can easily say that all of my fears and doubts were squashed just like that crazy mutant poodle. Getting over early that this movie was showcasing nothing but a CG Hulk, I soon became fascinated with the story. It didn't bother me that they focused on actually developing his person before having him go berserk and smash the place to bits. (Gee...it makes you think, doesn't it?) The creative direction, Elfman's innovative score, and the enigmatic plot only added to the flavor of this menacing blockbuster.Ang Lee is an incredible director, and his talent shows through here beautifully. He uses a device which made me love the movie even more than I would have. Using a lot of split screens, he turned the live action movie into a living comic book. The action, however brutal, was calmer than, say, Daredevil or Blade II. There was also a serious tone which I credit to Ang Lee, making the story more mysterious and dramatic. It may be had to feel any empathy toward a green giant who tosses tanks like shot-put, but I feel for the man. (I really do.)Eric Bana, Jennifer (The Most Beautiful Woman on the Planet) Connelly, and Sam Elliot star as the main characters, giving each their own outstanding performances. Elliot surprised me the most, being both rational and irrational at the same time (weird, huh?). Unfortunately, I am not a big Nick Nolte fan, so his dimension was lacking a bit. But Bana really did a fantastic job as Bruce Banner, better than I had thought. As for Jennifer...enough said. (DYNAMITE!)I love this recent boom of comic book movies. My Marvel Comic dreams have finally come to light with X-Men, Spider-Man, Daredevil, the works. Counting out Blade II, this is the best of all of the recent Marvel movies. The reason, I feel, is that The Hulk is not so quick to be an action movie. It is a story which must be developed before it can be exploited. Much like Spider-Man, you get the background of the hero in extreme detail. Yet this film weaves the entire tale of his becoming throughout the film, ultimately revealing his dreams and nightmares when the time is right.Overall, this is a fantastic movie which impressed me greatly. I would have given it more credit, if it had not gone the way it had at the end. (Sorry, I just didn't get the Absorbing Man ending) Aside from that, Ang Lee has created another work of art. While with Crouching Tiger, it was the complacency and art of war. Here...it's the all out fury.",Hulk
539,rjaymolina,7 Years Later...,8,31 July 2010,"Ang Lee's interpretation of the Hulk remains to be one of the most underrated comic book movies of all time. I've learned to appreciate what Lee was trying to do at the time and rank this film up there with The Dark Knight. To put his career on his line and create something unique is a bold move on Lee's part and I've got to say: Bravo.When I was younger I really only loved the action scenes. Everything else was okay by comparison. But now if I want the Hulk in action, I can at least view Ed Norton's Incredible Hulk.Ang Lee's Hulk is a though-provoking piece of art with it's only fault being that ridiculous dog fight scene. Eric Bana gets lost in the role of Bruce Banner, conflicted with repressed memories from his childhood. Jennifer Connelly turns in an Oscar-worthy performance as Betty Ross, trying to justify everything that's happening to a man that she still loves despite their relationship problems. Sam Elliot plays the conflicted father, who at first appears to be a by-the-book general, but by the end really puts himself in any father's shoes. Josh Lucas is the corrupt corporate sleaze bag, trying to own a piece of the world in the palm of his hand. And lastly, Nick Nolte, who plays the edgy scientist who's curiosity with science transforms into a dangerous obsession.At the core of it, the film is really about father-issues. It's a psychological drama, and a damn good one. Lee masterfully blended reality with comic book fiction through the use of his editor, who was able to give the film it's comic book feel, literally, without making it redundant. Lee's editor should have also gotten an Oscar-nod.The pace is beautifully slow at times, trying to find what shakes Bruce Banner at his core. But whenever the action kicks in, it leaves you wanting more.Danny Elfman's composes a unique and haunting soundtrack that really pushes his boundaries and almost makes you forget that it's a Danny Elfman score. Within the first couple of seconds of the opening titles you know you're in for a dark and twisted ride down Bruce Banner's mind.With Marvel's recent films they're really only using each individual superhero movie to build up to the Avengers. And while that's okay, it really doesn't leave a lot of room for each character to grow. This film, along with all the other superhero films that came out around this time, accomplishes that. Well except for Ghost Rider and the Fantastic Four...To sum it up, after seven years I feel like this movie should be given a second chance. Ang Lee has never disappointed.8/10 (NOW YOU MAY ALL DISAGREE WITH ME, because I know that's what you guys do.)",Hulk
540,cubs2001,"Over directed, under acted, and boring!",2,25 July 2003,"I have to admit I am not a huge fan of comic books or the Hulk. I still thought it might be pretty good because I did like the television show and Ang Lee at the helm, what could go wrong. I'm guessing someone forgot to tell Ang Lee this was about a comic book character and not Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon II. I do like and have read the comic books of Batman, Spider-Man, and X-Men. So I figured this would be just as good. So I know comic books can have a good story and drama to tell. The plot and story of the Hulk are not the problem, it is the acting and directing. The acting was not too boring, but close enough. The actors and acting seem to be as dry as cardboard and reading from a script that is just as dry. Both Eric Bana and Sam Elliot act like Al Gore showing little if any emotion. The only bright spot to the acting was Jennifer Connelly carrying her oscar winning acting from A Beautiful Mind to the Hulk.    Now there is the directing to the Hulk. At first the comic book style split screen was cool and neat, but after fifteen minutes it got real annoying. Mr. Lee I think the audience knew the movie was based on a comic book. There also seemed to be a large number of cuts and of fade ins and outs, like every thirty seconds. Then there are the action scenes which are far and few between. I thought the CGI effects looked really good, so tell me why most of the action scenes where shot in complete darkness. Finally can anyone tell me what was with the sequence in the middle of the main action scene when the Hulk suddenly appears and says ""punny human."" Why did the studio get Ang Lee and not Tim Burton, Sam Raimi, Bryan Singer, or even Richard Donner to direct this. These directors might not have done any better with this so called grade ""A"" material. The Hulk ranks with another disappointing comic book movie Dare Devil both earning 1.5 stars out of 4 or a D+.",Hulk
541,Counter-Strike,A Classic.,8,4 July 2003,"I watched the movie yesterday amidst mixed reactions from movie-goers. And I finally understood what some meant when they wrote that the Hulk is for people who want to be entertained at a more intellectual level.The Hulk is definitely not X-Men 2 - don't expect action from the second the movie starts till the time that it ends. What the movie is really is about good old fashion story-telling. It's more like the original Superman the movie, and takes it's time to establish character background and so on. Unlike what some naysayers had said, the movie didn't drag for the first hour because Ang Lee did very well in the character build-up. The first hour seemed more like fifteen minutes to me because the story was told so well that I was engrossed in what the characters had to say.
And when the Hulk finally appeared...I was blown out of my mind. All my fears about a CGI Hulk vanished into thin air as the experts had done their homework and the Hulk looked incredible. What hit the spot for me was the facial expressions of the green creature that really exhibited the humanity beneath the monster - greatly illustrating what the Hulk is really all about, a person cursed rather than a blessed super-hero.Sounds like I'm taking apart a literary piece of work? You bet, 'coz the Hulk is a classic. And that's why some people hate it.8 out of 10 stars.",Hulk
542,sulari,A hulking mess,3,20 June 2003,"I think I only hated one movie more than this one: The Royal Tenenbaums. The reason for that is that I got Soooo BOOOOOOred with this piece of nonsense. People were laughing throughout and some others left. I wish I did too. I think director Ang Lee took this material too seriously. The way the actors were directed simply did not mesh with the material, which had some of the worst writing. Writing about this is boring too.",Hulk
543,trumpman30,Never have I seen such a boring movie.,2,29 June 2003,"Some Spoilers.I didn't really want to see it in the first place; I had seen the trailers and they all looked really cheesy, but I went to see it anyway because my friend bought me a ticket and I thought if it was really bad at least it would be entertainment.  Boy, was I wrong.About 20 minutes into the movie, I fell asleep for the first time and woke up about 30 minutes later....I looked over at my friend and gave him a hand signal that meant ""alright already, let's get on with it.""  Seriously, the first 50 minutes of the film will make you feel like you just sat (or slept) through an exceptionally boring science class...complete with frogs and everything.  This section of the movie was so mind numbingly boring with absolutely NO comic relief that it ruined whatever else the film had to offer afterwards (which wasn't much)  Well, anyway, about 50 minutes in, for one reason or another, our main character has the ability to turn into a huge green guy after being exposed to some gamma radiation.  I still don't know why it's a big green guy and not a big (not green) guy, a normal sized green guy, a dog, a cat, a flower or why he even has an ability to transform at all even though the first 50 minutes of the movie was a vain attempt in trying to explain this.  But getting past this, we get to see what we came to see the movie in the first place anyway, the Hulk.  So he turns into the hulk, and has a fight with what I think were dogs that also apparently had the ability to grow in size and strength but they weren't green.  Now you can't really tell what's going on in this fight scene...no no...that would be too entertaining...instead it's shown in the middle of the night by absolutely no street lights so you can't tell what's going on at all.  He turns back into the bruce (I think that was his name) again for whatever reason and the movie goes back into a mind numbing state of boringness for another stretch of time. 
Once again, the slow pace of the movie left me again in a confused slumber. I woke up again surprised.  I was actually looking at an action scene with the hulk in broad daylight!  I, however was quickly dissapointed when I found out that the hulk is apparently invincible in addition to being big and green, so whatever suspense the action scene carried bounces away faster than bullets bounced off the hulk's chest.  So despite being invincible, the Hulk still runs away from the army  and finds himself in San Francisco.  In this scene he jumps on the back of a fighter jet to save it from hitting a bridge.  Now, I'm no physics expert but I'm pretty sure the hulk had to weigh a great deal as he is bigger than the jet he jumps on to.  Not only does the jet not plummet into the water under the stress of the hulk's weight plus the additional force that was exerted on it b/c the hulk jumped some 40 feet onto the plane, the plane is able to fly straight upwards carrying all that cargo at such an angle that would make any regular fighter jet stall.  But that's ok...at least it's good action.  Anyway, the plane flies until it can see stars...the hulk passes out and plummets 10 miles back to earth, makes a tiny splash into the pacific ocean and is unhurt by the whole ordeal.  He goes on fighting for 5 more minutes until he sees his ex wife and shrinks down to normal size (awww..how sweet.)  Anyway,  I'm thinking this is the end and I'll finally get to go home, but before I do, they made me sit through another extremely darkly lit action scene with his father.  I won't try to tell you what happens b/c it was too dark to know, but his father is killed by a gamma bomb (yes, the hulk doesn't even kill him and he is killed by the same thing that apparently gives them transforming abilities in the first place)  The hulk is of course unhurt by this b/c he is under a shallow layer of water.  Afterwards, the movie just teases you with a painstakinly slow conversation between the hulk's ex wife and her father, the military commander.  Apparently, this is the first time they've talked in a year since all this happened.  Please god, no Hulk 2 =(.",Hulk

There's action, drama, and the story line and cinematography is awesome!!!   The only people who don't lie this movie are dullards!! There's no way  it has everything!!!  There's something for everybody except a kid under 8.-(which by the way I had to sit in front oftalked the whole movie, and I still loved it!!!) This movie was awesome.head and shoulders above Spiderman. (Spiderman being my favorite marvel hero)  Spiderman tried to relate to a certain age group. It looked like it was filmed on a set. This was a movie made for the sake of making a movie.  That's what makes it so great.  If you can appreciate a movie, you will like this movie. And it has talent.   If you go in with a pre-formed opinion, you'll come out with one.   If you just can't get it, can't follow the story line, have a short attention span, you won't like it either.  It takes some intelligence and attention to follow the plot. All the people that I've spoken with who have reserve of with this movie (without even seeing it), are hung up on the hulk as it was for TV with Lou Farigno.  If you think the hulk should have been some bodybuilder in a suit.get over yourself.  Get with the times!  These/you same people would be the ones to criticize it if they put someone in a suit, saying  `they should have used a computer generated characterwhat with all this technology.  Put it to some use!!!  They did this movie top notchcouldn't have been better.  If you think you could do bettermake a suggestion!!! There are scenes where the hulks hair is blowing in the breeze!!  I was amazed.  It was unbelievable!!! Let me tell you I don't vote movies lightly.  I see every movie that comes out.   I am just a movie buffit's my hobby.  This makes my comment credible, unlike some of these other fools. I recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys an overall great movie.  It has everything your looking for in just the right amount.  Character development, great plot, action, cinematography, great acting and special effects.

546,charlietruffles,Not a clue about science or American Comic Book experience,4,14 August 2003,"Ang Lee has great skill in directing and narrating personal relationships. This worked great in the exotically placed Crouching Tiger, especially since he approached it from a young girl's perspective; and it seems that milieu held a special interest for him.  But the Hulk is an American pop icon and such should be treated as such: ""give the audience what they want.""What we were treated to was an unstable balance, like the Bruce Banner/Hulk personality, of summer entertainment and ""high art.""  The major film critics ragged on how unreal the Hulk appeared, but I think it was amazing to see a completely CG created monster who thought and interacted with live elements(and bravo for not making him to cute and cuddly).  What destroyed the believabilty of this film was the unbelievability of the plot and the lack of empathy with the characters.  The secret of every good comic book is to buy the next issue.  The film was very caught up in technique and backstory to really let this film take off.  In addition, Bruce Banner spends a lot of time in a lab that doesn't appear to be believable.  These scenes made me think: ""Wow! that's Jennifer Connely in a lab coat"" or ""Eric Bana looked cooler in Black Hawk Down.""  Do a little reasearch on biological science if you're going t obombard the audience with it for half the movie.
It was in essence two movies.  One a character driven film and the other a chase film with all the bells and whistles.  Bruce Banner's backstory and his relationship to his fathe, Nick Nolte, is so contrived and lame that once again the final showdown at the end is a complete letdown.  I don't believe the filmmakers knew how to end the film so gave us a light show. When Spielberg gives us a light show in Raiders or Clos Encounters at least there was meaning behind it.So, in conclusion, I want to ask that with the size differential between the Hulk and Bruce Banner how come the Hulk's pants fit? If the film was fun I wouldn't have worried about it.",Hulk
547,lazylaurablue,Somewhat Disappointing,4,7 January 2007,"Just quite what the production team were trying to achieve over and above what has already been done with the Hulk rather escaped me. ""Look what we can do with the computer graphics!"" seems to be the theme here, and all I got left thinking was ""Okay, what a shame Lou Feringo didn't want the part..."" Quite a nice story, but of course that was already laid down. I thought the monster was laughable; ET was very much better- and how long ago was that done? It's okay for the kids though, and the acting's okay. It's just a shame about the animations, although I must admit to enjoying the bit where the Hulk gets the better of a pack of nasty dogs. That's about all though. I preferred the original David Banner too, but I suppose it's not the done thing to look much over 30 these days, is it? The rest of the film is okay, just not the Hulk bits, and surely the Hulk is the main point of the film, isn't it? Not a patch on the old 80s TV series, no way.",Hulk

Let me explain this to you; I don't EVER turn off movies or leavebefore they are over. My motto is ""Every movie has at least 1 thing about it that is good"". I have gone to the local video store and rented everything in the oldrelease section, starting with the 'A's and making my wayalphabetically. And I never turned anything off before. Never. I have sat through crappy horror movies, boring dramas,braindead action movies, sappy romances, and unfunny comedies. I have sat through bad porn. I have sat through bad gay porn, and I'm NOT GAY!! I have sat through the Star Wars Holiday Special. This is what it means when I say that the film was so bad that Ihad to turn it off.I gave it a second try, and managed to force my way through untilthe end. The movie sucks. I was expecting a bad, cheesy action movie with mediocre specialeffects. I was right, but it was also an incredibly long, drawn out,slow paced, nonsensical piece of utter garbage. The dialogue not only is extremely poorly written, but thecharacters talk at length about nothing. There's this one scene in the movie where Betty Ross goes to talkto David Banner, presumably for a specific reason, and the scenegoes like this: She walks in and introduces herself. He rants, raves, and drools for something like 10 minutes. She walks back out again. What the HECK was the point of that!?The casting was bad, the acting was good only in the sense thatthey did what the director wanted. The CGI Hulk effects werecartoonish and he looks somehow a bit Chinese.The movie is bad. Not ""so bad it's funny"", not ""purposefully bad tomake a point"", not ""low-budget bad"", just BAD in the strictestsense meaning evil, painful, and malevolent.

My normally quick wit wasparalyzed by the sheer awfulness of this film.I tried watching it again one time, just to see if it was as bad as iremembered, but my eyeballs took such offense to the notion that Imight once again subject them to the pure and utter hell that is thismovie, that they popped out of my eye-sockets and tried to roll outthe front door. I crawled along the floor, bleeding out of my empty eye-socketsand listening for their squishy rolling sounds. Eventually I caughtthem, washed the dust and cat-hair off of them, and put them backin.

549,The_Master_Critic,The Hulk is boring. It's as simple as that. (slight spoilers),3,6 November 2004,"Following the path created by Spiderman, X-Men, and even Daredevil (as bad as that was), Hulk jumps into the theaters at a time when Comic Book movies have become extremely popular. One of the reasons that Spiderman and the two X-Men films were so popular is that they didn't take themselves too seriously. They were a lot of fun with their over the top villains, incredible effects, and characters that we could all relate to in some way. Well, with the Hulk, Ang Lee decided to ditch that formula altogether. He has created a dull, drab, BORING comic book movie with mediocre effects and actors that are trying way too hard to create characters that we just don't care about.Speaking of characters we just don't care about Eric Bana's Bruce Banner just happens to be one of the most stale characters I've seen in modern cinema. The only thing I can relate to is that neither he nor I can successfully carry a movie well I've never really tried. I think it's time for introductions: ""Made for TV"", this is Eric Bana. Eric Bana, this is your future. As bad as the CG Hulk was (and he was bad), the CG Hulk was much more personable than Bruce Banner. It's bad when your computer generated non speaking mediocre effect driven alter ego is better in the film than you are. Sorry, BanaNow for the rest of the cast. As much as I dislike Nick Nolte, he did have a few good moments. Too bad the rest of his over the top antics seem forced. As for his appearance. I'm pretty sure he went straight from his DUI arrest to the set...Then there is the lovely Jennifer Connelly. Why was she in this movie? I'm guessing to give the film some sort of credibility. She did make the movie less excruciating to watch, but she was really wasted in this role, and she really had nothing to work with.A couple positive notes: I enjoyed Sam Elliot in this film, even though he is playing the same character he plays in other movies. He was entertaining to watch. I also enjoyed watching Josh Lucas from Sweet Home Alabama. Sure he's a poor man's Matthew McConaughey, but he still brought flare to his small part that was very much needed in this bore.Now for the CG hulk. At times, the Hulk looks OK, but most of the time he looks like he was ripped out of the video game and superimposed over the appropriate frames. The film makers had to realize that the success of their film relied on the success of the computer generated Hulk. I wholeheartedly believe that once they saw how unsuccessful their Shrek-like creation was ( DONKEY !! ), they decided to showcase the Hulk to a lesser degree which is why we are forced to endure the excruciatingly slow first act. The entire first hour is full of back story and 'plot' that really makes the film drag. We didn't pay 8 bucks to catch up on some overly complex plot that would have been better served as a voice over narration during the opening credits. We paid the money to simply see the hulk cause havoc. And eventually he does just that. There were enjoyable moments where the Hulk gets to cause mass destruction and these are the moments that I remember most fondly (besides the closing credits when I got to leave ). These moments are few and far between, but they are fun though unoriginal.There a few scenes which really bothered me. Firstly, there are moments when the hulk is jumping across the desert with each leap seemingly covering miles. It was as if he were flying across the land. Yes, Ang Lee. I saw crouching tiger get over it. The other scene that bothered me worse than anything is truly inexplicable. It happens about 20 minutes after they should have ended the movie and it involves Nick Nolte's huge electrical beast (don't ask ) trying to suck the green out of the Hulk (I'm serious). Somehow they become some huge amoeba type mass of energy and I really have no idea why or how. It was at that moment that I realized the movie just kept getting dumber and dumber. Each minute was worse than the previous, so at any given moment I was watching the worst part of the movie.One thing I feel Ang Lee did well was to use some comic book stylized transitions between scenes. There were some really nice transition effects using different frames ( ala 24 ), that really gave the movie some much need personality and style. Well done.

551,dashaunfolife,Hulk Rules...........,10,14 February 2015,"This film is not only in my opinion the best MARVEL film but the best character study in a comic book film ever, and it's disappointing to me that the stuff taken from the comics is considered inaccurate. 1st the Hulk dogs were in the comic books they first appeared in 1984 called a gamma dog. 2nd the computer generated imagery they say he looks like Shrek 1st the film came out in 2003 2nd they were done by industrial light and magic and 3rd he does not look like Shrek to me at all the cg for 03 is amazing and to me they still hold up. 3rd the plot is to complicated in my opinion this film is easier to follow than dark knight and i was 3 when i first saw this in theaters and it didn't bore me at all.4th they change hulks origin what i have to say is your a freaking idiot like Stan Lee's original comic Bruce banner saves someone from the gamma rays and he gets stuck in it but instead of a blast its a machine like the 1970's TV show. Finally in my honest opinion this film is a great well acted character study with great visuals characters and villains with an amazing plot ahead of its time.",Hulk
552,Rimsey,What's Big Green and made of Plastic?,1,8 July 2003,"I have to admit I was interested to see what the Hulk would translate to on the big screen.  With the success of X-Men and Spiderman from the Marvel stable I thought it would be a safe bet that The Hulk would be up to the same high standard.I was sadly mistaken......This is the first film in my living history that I can say was truly awful!With the marketing frenzy of toys and Hulk gear, you would think that it was suitable for a young audience?  No - nowhere near it.  Parents be advised *DO NOT* if you value the sanity of your children take them to see this. There are images in there that will give them nightmares for a week.For shame Ang Lee.  Exploding Frogs and mutilated Dogs do not make good Childrens viewing!",Hulk
553,TVkid,"Hulk Smashes, Crashes!",6,20 June 2003,"I was so tempted to go with the cliche, ""It ain't easy being green."" But considering that every newspaper and magazine (including EW) already has done so, I'll throw aside the tripe and get down to business -- this movie was a BIG disappointment. The beginning moves way too slow and given how much time is spent on dialogue, we're only given caricatures of characters. Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) cries, Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) mopes and General Thunderbolt Ross (Sam Elliott) gets mad -- and they all do it a lot. This is supposed to be a movie about a giant green monster who smashes things, but the action sequences are short and too spread out. Director Ang Lee basically has tried to making a thinking man's film about an unthinking creature ruled by emotion, most of it rage. The concept just doesn't work.Also, even though most of Industrial Light and Magic's work in creating the totally CGI Hulk is good and makes a believable creature, some of the effects are sub par. The ending battle sequence between Banner and his father was too dark and I had trouble making out exactly what was going on. The same was true -- though not as bad -- in an earlier fight sequence in the film between the Hulk and some gamma-irradiated dogs.After reading several articles about the making of the film, I would guess that Industrial Light and Magic and Lee added shadowing to make the Hulk look more realistic and just went overboard.This wasn't a terrible film, but it's not going to set any box office records. Wait for the DVD.",Hulk
554,ihateleo,Excellent and Misunderstood.,10,3 September 2003,"First of all when I sat down to watch this film I was definately expecting it to be nothing more than an intellectually-devoid piece of summer crap.I was so wrong by the time this film ended, what I witnessed was a beautifully filmed and told drama story.It was obvious that director Ang Lee intended for this to be a real movie as the scenes are mature, compelling and sometimes dark.This film was not very well received by many 'critics' and movie-goers alike, I guess they expected it to be like many other overrated and highly regarded garbage like Spider-Man, LOTR etc.Once again this truly excellent movie shows you that it doesnt take a cast of pretty-boy actors, cgi overkill or countless lines of braindead humor to make a very pure and exciting film.This is intelligent cinema with a very talented and visionary director and a cast that all boasts unique and superb performances.Better not turn your brain off for this one.",Hulk
555,MWilley,Don't expect a typical action movie,8,23 June 2003,"(Minor Spoilers Ahead)*****I liked this movie, but it is far from what I expected walking into the theater.  The best scene in the film is not one of the CGI action-fest scenes full of tanks and explosions, but the start of Act III - a simple backdrop on a empty, darkened stage with just a single spotlight on each actor, where father and son scream out their pent up Oedipal rage to each other and the heavens.

556,tommx,so bad it's worse,1,30 November 2005,"i'll admit right out that the hulk was never quite a favorite comic book of mine. i tended to find the hulk annoying. my opinion changed when the TV series came around, and they managed to create a compelling tale out of this idea. while the effects were very primitive (with the hulk's green often wearing off of his body as he moved around), i could buy the show.when the movie came around, i largely banked on it being an ang lee production thinking that he could make it really really good. boy was i wrong.to begin with, the script simply doesn't work. i don't know whether the goals were too ambitious or what, but the result was endless exposition about something i ultimately didn't care about. the whole subplot about bruce's mother being murdered by his father did nothing for me. the hulk itself honestly made me laugh out loud when i first saw it. i just couldn't take it seriously or suspend my disbelief.and nick nolte...oh my god...he was terrible.i actually walked out of the theater on this one but later decided to check out the ending out of curiosity, thinking maybe there was something i'd missed or that i was being unfair. i wasn't. the ending is as laughable as the rest of the movie.i guess the moral of the story is, don't try to make hamlet out of a comic book, and don't assume that just because spider man and the x-men translated well to the screen that every comic book hero is going to work as a movie. the hulk proved to us pretty tellingly that this is not the case.let's hope they have the good sense not to try to make a movie out of thor. that would be even worse.",Hulk
557,VietDo,What a movie....,10,25 June 2003,"I was very happy with the movie.I heard that Ang Lee does not comic books, but the way he subliminally had the split screens, transitions, and multishots was awesome, definitely a homage to comics.  I've seen movies overdue that way too much, but you can count the number of comic style transitions on one hand.  My only complaint was the ending with the father should have been made extended, it would have given the hulk more of a climax ending.  I'll definitely have to look for the extended version on DVD.I know someone made a comment about the proportions of the hulk not being consistent, I hope they realize that the hulk gets bigger when he's mad.",Hulk
558,fAiNt,not a good movie,1,21 June 2003,"Disregarding the hype, the buzz, and any expectations, The Hulk was simply a lousy film.  It tried to be something that it wasn't.  Rather than just accept the fact that it's a superhero movie about a big green dude in purple pants and take it for what it is, the film tried to intricate and deep, and the result was simply lame.  The attempt for a complex plot resulted in a pretty week story that tried to be suspenseful by just not telling you things.  This made it frustrating rather than suspenseful.  It also made it very long and very slow at parts.  There was way too much buildup.  Anyone going to see a movie about a comic book character that becomes a green monster when he gets mad is coming to see an enjoyable (and expectedly mindless) action flick.  The filmmakers should have just gone with this. Instead they took on deeper issues and tried for over-the-top and clichéd character depth that just simply did not work.  The comic book panel effect was far too over used and really just gave me a head ache as I tried to follow what was going on in each.  I wasn't impressed by any of the acting and was honestly bored throughout most of the film.  There are super-hero films like Spider-Man which understand what they are and work well with it.  On the other end of the spectrum there are super-hero films like X-Men and X2 that take on more of a story line and add character depth and do a good job.  This one didn't know where it was and turned out pretty badly.",Hulk

561,Me Grimlock,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Hulk",1,22 June 2003,"Art house director Ang Lee took on the ambitious task of making a summer popcorn flick with ""Hulk"".  In my opinion, Lee has failed.  He tries hard, damn hard to make Hulk into a ""deep"" film.  Ang Lee is an art house director that makes movies for the intellectual minded moviegoer that prefer films with subtitles rather then watching action and quick editing.  Lee's credits include ""The Ice Storm"" and ""Sense and Sensibility.  With the ""Hulk"", he brings the same art house feel to this movie, but it's totally wrong.  Lee tries to make a deep film out of a very shallow premise.  Come on now Ang, this is comic book material you are working with. Hulk is not supposed to be an artsy, talky film.  This should have been a comic book movie, not an attempt at deep Jungian psychodrama.  Hulk SHOULD have been a movie that was a 12 year old boys wet dream.  Hulk should have been loaded with ""kewl explosions"" and lots of fake looking CGI.  The Hulk succeeds in having plenty of fake looking CGI.  The CGI created Hulk is terrible and very cheesy looking.  But the film has very few action sequences, and what it does have makes little sense.  We don't even get to see the Hulk until 50 minutes into the movie.  Then there's that WTF ending that leaves you scratching your head.By summer blockbuster standards, Hulk is already a box office bomb.  It only raked in about $60 million in U.S. domestic dollars for it's opening weekend.  You just know that there will be plenty of bad word of mouth for a movie like this, and then add on the unavoidable drop in box office gross for the second and third weekend and you have another Godzilla or Waterworld type film.  By the way, I saw SEVERAL WALK OUTS.  It was usually parents escorting their restless kids out of the theater.  Don't take a child under 10 to this movie.  There is no bad language, sex, or gory violence,....but the movie is WAY too SLOW and TALKY for children.  Any kid under 10 will be bored out of their ass with this movie.4/10",Hulk

I didn't know who was the director, and later when I discover it was Ang lee, I understood the special style of the film. The beginning is the part I liked the most, the music and the way the images are displayed is really pure art, the movie it's not perfect, but it's far the best adaption I could imagine for this character which is not really my favorite from the Marvel Universe, but since I saw this movie that perception has totally changed, The cast and the performances are also very good. I still don't understand why some people didn't like it, fortunately the majority of friends I recommended the movie have agreed with me ""the movie is really a great adaptation from the comic book"" I just hope the second part won't ruin what the first one achieved",Hulk

There is no prisoner type plot where the Banner wanders into danger and the Hulk gets him out. This is a drama, and the origin of the Hulk. It's long, and the Hulk is made of CGI.I loved this movie. I was enraptured from the beginning till the end. I've watched it several times on cable and I own it. I can't understand who wouldn't like it, except for people who expect the Fast and the Furious, and get the Ice Storm instead. Sorry there weren't enough explosions for people.Overall, the only problem with the film are the comic book paneling of it, which is sometimes obtrusive and the length.

Crouching tiger... didn't impress me much and Sense and sensibility bored me to the point where I fell to sleep in the theater watching it(Ice storm is his only great film). But still, his work is highly praised, Crouching... made a lot of money and Hollywood mogul's decided to give him 130mil.$ to make The Hulk. What he made is something that's so bad that it's hard to beleive,the worse 100mil.+ budgeted film since Armageddon. What Lee tried to do is a serious film about a man that turns in to a huge green monster when he gets angry,10 times his normal size,but still never loses his pants,they just stretch. In doing so, he made Nick Nolte deliver the worse role in his life and almost sealled Eric Bana's Hollywood carrier. The film itself is extremly boring, and when something interesting starts to happen Lee screwes it up with splitting the screen in 2,3,4 or even more small screeens simply because he had to be cool. Split screen worked in early De Palma's work, here it's just annoying. CGI is so-so,with such a huge budget it should have been much better.",Hulk

What a waste. What surprises me the most isn't that Ang Lee tried to make a story like the Hulk one of deeply profound emotion and feeling...it's that the studio execs who only care about the numbers actually greenlighted the final cut of the film.

But once the plot of the film began to unfold, and the major father figures played by Sam Elliott and Nick Nolte got into the action, the movie really started to rock.The action sequences are tremendous and the acting is very strong. Ang Lee's directing is intriguing as well ... and I particularly love the way he evokes comic-book-panel imagery in his shots. The film has a very inventive visual style that is as impressive, or more so, than the Hulk himself. And I did find the Hulk creature great fun to watch, whether he is having a touching moment with Betty or he's fighting tanks or he's part of a horrific dream sequence.  Good stuff.  Actually, it has been a while since there has been a cool, ""misunderstood"" monster film, and I felt an appreciation for this movie even as I was reminded of classic films like King Kong and Frankenstein.While faithful to the comic book, this film is actually superior to its source material in that the characters are more realistic and more complex - especially Bruce Banner's father, who has a truly fascinating background and motivation. And it is harder than it looks doing a good job bringing a comic book to life on screen. Just look at the Batman films, which are all seriously flawed. Certainly the movie critic I respect most, Roger Ebert, has yet to really be wowed by any super hero film since Superman 2, and I can understand why ... they sometimes seem bi-polar when they shift from live-action actor to CGI when Eric turns into HULK and Tobey turns into SPIDEY. And a lot of these movies do recycle origin stories and villains like nobody's business. (ie: the endless Joker rehashes.)You know... it is a very difficult thing trying to come up with an objective way of judging the quality of the super hero movies that have been coming out the past few years, because everyone has a different level of expectation about how realistic the film should be, how fun it should be, how literate the script should be, how faithful it should be to its source comic or tv show, how many punk-rock characters should be included, and how many nuclear countdowns and car chases should be involved.  And I bet it is even more difficult for the directors and producers and scriptwriters to decide how they will balance dramatic considerations ... and to do justice to the acting talents of the A-list casts that are being assembled for what was once considered B-movie material ... with the requisite number of action scenes meant to please audiences hoping to be wowed by the latest advances in CGI technology.Although this balancing act is hard to pull off successfully, I was delighted with the Spider-Man film because I feel that the movie managed to strike the balance quite nicely.  In that film, the comic character that I love best was realized wonderfully by Tobey when in his civilian mode ... and he had great fight scenes with the Goblin when he was in costume. I didn't like X2 because I felt that the characters got left behind by one glitzy special effect after another, so I found it to be a very boring and numbing film ... while the more character-driven X-Men (1.5) was a more exciting movie to me because the characters were more real and the actors were given the chance to emote before the camera cut away to the next effects sequence. On the other hand, I thought Daredevil had too many slow character scenes and not enough action. But Hulk, like Spider-Man, gets the mix right.

The movie reminded me of something out of the 50's as far as the plot goes. Yes I understand this is a comic book movie, but look at good examples of comic book movies like Spiderman and Xmen. This movie just doesn't cut it. Everytime he turned into the hulk I felt myself laughing at how ridiculous he looked. Good CGI = Yoda from Attack of the Clones, Bad CGI = The Hulk. Now this whole plot of him and his father was so bad I found myself wanting to fall asleep, and then when his father became the electric man I wish I had a gun.

570,BradleyUK,Great...until the end,7,14 May 2004,At first I was really enjoying Ang Lee's HULK. The Comic book style & split screens were excellent. The CGI Hulk was incredible. I even cared for Bruce thanks to the excellent build up to when he first gets angry...ROARRRR!Then Suddenly...POP..The Hulk bubble bursts and there is some weird blob/Energy/Fight/Mind power mess of a final battle which for me ruined everything. On a second viewing where I expected this to happen I wasn't so disappointed so id advise all people to view it a few times just to see the few moments of Ang Lee brilliance that are in this flick.I'm giving it 7/10 for the fact that up until the final scene I was enthralled by this movie (with a different end it would have got an 8),Hulk
571,tdelaney1,Hulk Smash Evil Military-Industrial Scum,8,12 December 2003,"I bought the Hulk from the first issues and for years later. At first I was concerned at the 'updating' of the origin story but adapted comfortably a few minutes in. Ang Lee's direction, the cinematography and effects were truly at a new level of technical excellence. It was always a joke that the Hulk would expand from skinny Bruce Banner into the giant Hulk and somehow the pants didn't burst off of him and then shrank back when he became Bruce again. Ultraviolence is always acceptable in comics or cinema, not so full-frontal nudity, especially male. Maybe this says something about the 'buried trauma' of our society that makes it so much like the Hulk.
The acting by Bana(Banner), Connelly(Betty), Elliott(General Ross) and Nolte(Bruce Banner's father) was all appropriate and fine. I had actually expected that this movie would be a gross, shallow brute-force-only kind of affair and was enthusiastically surprised to find it none of these.Casting was great. Ross (looking just like his comic-book character) and Talbot exemplify the archetypes so nearly universally despised. Too bad Jack Kirby didn't live to see this.Great touch of the Arabic music in the soundtrack (which rose up when the heavy desert battle scenes occurred). Most Americans and most humans prefer to root for the underdog rather than the dober-men in olive drab.So gratifying to see high-tech tanks, copters and jets reduced to rubble. The movie took on the evil of militarism and correctly portrayed the demonic weapons development industries.In this jingoist age, I was surprised to see this allowed by a usually official-line tethered Hollywood.I imagine this movie made a lot of warmongers squirm in their seats and call for more pressure for 'patriotic' spin in tinseltown. If there are working theatres in Baghdad now; I doubt the 'coalition' allows this movie played there. Nolte's speech about all the misery caused humanity by these people had us on our feet, going ""YES!""",Hulk
572,SolidSnake86XX,Ang Lee's American Masterpiece,9,28 September 2003,"First off, I'd like to say that superhero movies get a lot a of bad hype. They're not bad movies, it's just sometimes telling origins gets in the way or the director/producer doesn't take enough of a creative license with it. Ang Lee did an excellent job with Hulk.  Of all the superhero movies I've ever seen (which is nearly all of them), this one remains the pinnacle of underlying philosophical substance (excepting possibly Raimi's Spider-Man). Hulk deals with how sorrow, anger, and all the other related emotions can build up within a man and can manifest physically.  Admittedly, no one will become big and green, but that's more symbolic of the kind of monsters people can become.  Hitler, for instance, was hardly an eyesore, but when it's all said and done, he remains one of the most atrocious monsters in the history of mankind.Hulk's plot was a rather interesting spin on Bruce's life and his relationship with Betty.  Again, I enjoyed the creative license they took with the property, and I even enjoyed the little twist at the end between Bruce and his father.  When I saw this movie, I was on the edge of my seat. I could feel every bone-crunching hit between Hulk and the mutated canines. I felt all kinds of emotions during Hulk's battles, including the jet scene. I felt so much in the movie I could almost smell Ross's breath during his close-ups.  I loved this movie, more so than even Spider-Man who happens to be my favorite American superhero.  And to be honest, I was never really a Hulk person.  On a scale of 1-10, I'd have to give it a solid 9.",Hulk
573,whatisitskip56,A film with no home,6,22 January 2006,"For me HULK was somewhat of a letdown even though I couldn't admit it until several years after seeing it. I am a fan of the character and the very theme of dual natures striving for supremacy in a person as well as the exhilaration of throwing civilized inhibition to the wind and going for a mindless rampage. The problem with this film is that it tries to be so deep and human in these themes that it loses balance because the hulk sequences feel like an afterthought and the drama of Banner's turmoil is not dealt with very well at all.The build up to the first transformation is nothing short of boring. Bruce Banner is supposed to be a distant guy but he comes across as two-dimensional. I have fond memories of watching Eric Bana on Australian TV and in the filmic masterpiece that is CHOPPER but in HULK he seems bored and confused with the material. His lines are delivered very flatly and all complexity in the character is gone. To me, Bruce Banner/the Hulk is a modern Jekyll and Hyde and the Hulk is the engine of destruction through which Banner's darkest feelings of hurt and rage can burst forth loose his demons upon the world. It is a shame then that when the Hulk is unleashed he comes across as an afterthought. The rampages seem really tacked on. They look awesome for the most part but you don't get the feeling of a manifest personal demon taking revenge on a harsh world, you see a direction-less blob of CGI doing stuff that looks cool for the camera. This would have been fine if it wasn't so jarring to the pace of the film, which needs a good kick in the tail pipe. Personally I blame Ang Lee. Hulk is a drama and is supposed to be but the sterile character direction and development, along with the painful dialogue and stagy flashbacks that should have been very personal and harrowing but instead came across as sterile and storybook make for a slow burn that is resolved with abrupt disappointment. The end of the film is awful. Nothing is resolved, there is an ugly, bland and unfathomably abstract battle with a villain that is a mockery of it's original comic book counterpart (Absorbing Man) and you are left feeling as though the last pages of the script were written in a mad rush to finish a film that wasn't heading anywhere to begin with.Ang Lee has a great art-house drama kind of sensibility that has created some beautiful films but in the context of HULK it comes across as totally sterile. The abstract desert imagery spliced with CGI jellyfish and other such puzzlements add nothing but pretension to a film that should have been kept simple. In blending art with pulp we are left with a mess that could have been polished into something both entertaining and thought provoking but was sadly left as a mess.I give this film a 6 for ambition, some nice CGI and action sequences (although they're better watched separate from the rest of the film), some fair performances (particularly from the lovely and talented Jennifer Connely) and for the fact that it tries to take the bland genre of comic book movies into a new direction but unfortunately it failed to do so. It is hard to explain why this film felt so awkward and wrong so i suggest all who are curious just see it and make up your own minds.",Hulk
574,Route 66,Terribly Disappointing,1,7 July 2003,"In going to see the Hulk I was expecting something in the style of Spider-Man, with fancy special effects, a good story line and some nice touches. The only thing that the Hulk had was good special effects. The story line was predictable and static, with very little intrigue and interest. The film mainly focuses around the Hulk (obviously) and his rage. His father genetically engineered himself and passed on the traits to his son. In the present day his son is working in a biotech lab when he is exposed to a great deal of gamma radiation. For some miraculous reason he is still alive. After this the film plummets quickly. For some unexplained reason the radiation 'triggered' the genetic engineering that was previously present inside him. Because of this he became a mutant. Whenever he became enraged at something he would transform into the Hulk and go around destroying things. The computer generated animations of the Hulk were quite impressive, detailing his face and body very well. After destroying things for a while the army gets on his back and decides that with a few bombs he'll be dead and the world will be saved. Not really. The more they shoot at him the more his rage fuels  him and they go on a long and pointless journey around the country blowing things up. There is no balance between feelings in the film, each scene is either very explosive and rather over the top, or it is boring and overly drawn out. <---Spoils Ending After this Point---> The ending comes over incredibly strangely. We find the Hulk battling his newly mutated father on the shore of a lake. His father turns into whatever he touches so the Hulk ends up fighting a stone monster, a water demon etc. etc, but then the army decides to nuke them both. The camera zooms out, and a plane flies in and nukes the lake that they are fighting in. The screen then becomes a flurry of motion and green swirls while faces and memories fly past after a few intensely boring minutes of this the screen changes to some unimportant things, and then they show the main character living in South America selling something to the natives, who try to steal something and he says ""You don't want to see me angry."" A pathetic attempt at a twist on the ending. Another gripe that I had about The Hulk is the editing. The transitions from scene to scene are done using outlined boxes containing parts of the movie gliding around the screen. Sometimes the screen has three or four angles of the scene that is happening, which gets very hard to watch, trying to decide which small section of the screen yields the best view of what is happening. When you find out that none of the angles offered are very good shots of the action then the scene changes and some other strange transition comes into play. It is nice to see people trying something new for a change, but this is not a good example of great editing. It is distracting and detracts from the movie, but maybe thats a good thing when you see how good the film itself is.",Hulk
575,exarch3d,"The Hulk: Not a bad film, although probably not what most people would be expecting.",7,18 July 2003,"This film doesn't resemble most of the OOT CGi fests summer superhero blockbusters that have been coming out over the last few months (possibly a good thing if you have overloaded on them like me). Matrix fanboys might find it rather dull, in fact. The movie it most closely resembles is Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. It has the same sedate pace, some of the beautiful desert scenery shots with accompanying classical music could actually have come straight out of CTHD. (It even has a fight in the tree tops).Lots of reviews have complained that it takes 45 minutes for the Hulk to appear, but it didn't feel like a long time to me. I actually liked the creation storyline and build up at the start. The other complaint i have seen around is that the Hulk looks fake. I actually thought the graphics looked pretty good (and about as real as a giant green bloke CAN look) and in general better than the scenes in the trailer made them look. My only real problem with them was that they seemed to be trying too hard to make the Hulk a good guy... he never seemed to hurt anyone (almost A-Team style with people always crawling out of crashed vehicles) and in fact came off a little too much like a sulking 2 year old throwing a tantrum and not enough like a menacing hulk.All the acting was good, especially Jennifer Connelly (grr!) and the old guys (Elliot, Nolte). Eric Bana was ok as Bruce Banner, although since he was playing someone who repressed their feelings he didn't really have a lot to work with.My favorite bit of the whole film was the cool split screens and clever foreground->background and background->foreground cuts which i thought gave a great comic book look to the whole thing.So: If you are looking for mindless non-stop action and explosions you probably want to give this a miss... if you liked CTHD or LOTR:FOTR and don't mind slower paced films then you might like it. 7/10That is rating on a scale of 1-10, not the usual 5-10 scale used in computer game reviews or anything.",Hulk

I was really surprised to find that the film was actually pretty damn good. The CGI was good enough and not as artificial as one might think from some of the screen shots. I was actually more impressed with the story and the dialogue, even if it was a bit complicated. The performances were good, Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly played the unlikely couple as well as they could have. Nick Nolte was a bit odd, but played the psychotic father quite well. Ang Lee has done a good job here, done his best not to make people think of CTCD, but instead enjoy this film in its own right. The only thing I thought was a bit silly, was when Nick Nolte turned into an electric freak, which spoilt the climax to the film (although the cgi was pretty cool).Anyway, would recommend it to people to go and see, good fun at the flicks.",Hulk

I expected a real action movie from beginning to end, but it is more of a drama. The story starts quite slowly (how it all started) and you have to wait for some real action.A very good thing is, that they made him actually as strong as in the comics.

580,KingOfLullaby,I shudder at the perfection.,10,20 June 2003,"When I had heard about the famed ""HULK"" returning to the silver-screen I had my doubts, because MARVEL had a good run with the movies it had released earlier in the year, and the year before. So, I had assumed that HULK would be the downfall. I never had a real respect for the HULK because, it sounded like a dull idea to me, but I promised myself I would never judge a movie without doing my homework. So I went and read the comics. Incredible, is all I can say. HULK was perpetuated, with the exception of a few events, so wonderfully that I could do nothing but look at the screen and clap blindly. The movie was fluid, one event leading into the next, no jumping, or plot gaps. Everything is given to you, then all you have to do is sit back and enjoy. Instead of basing a movie solely on it's FX, or Acting, HULK brought both aspects expertly to the screen. I can safely say, that this is by far my favorite MARVEL movie to date. Ang Lee has really outdone his-self this time and I hope his movies will be equally good in the future. I guarantee that anyone, from the hardcore comic book reader to the average action seeker, will thoroughly enjoy this film. And hopefully, they will gain from it the same satisfaction that I have. HULK does not let down. Any nay-say for this movie would most likely come from someone that hates action movies completely, and/or bases these movies entirely on the comics that precede them.5/5 Stars.",Hulk
581,joemovies-2,BORING !!!!! Typical tawainese directing,3,11 June 2008,I was so excited when i heard about a live version of the Hulk but as soon as i heard its directed by ANG LEE boy i was so put off. I had a feeling it'll be a real drag but just give it a shot anyway because i really like the Hulk. Man i should of believed in my instincts it was SOOO DRAGGY and when i showed it to my girlfriend only the action scenes she even slept.Trust me when i say its boring & draggy i believe majority of the audience agrees with me.

583,wmelick,Deeper than anything I've seen in this genre,10,22 June 2003,"I think people looking for fluff or mindless action movies (ala X2) will be very disappointed with Hulk. I don't even consider it in the same league as most recent Marvel movies. Spiderman was very good, but was ultimately a light-hearted positive movie. This is every bit just as good, but entirely opposite in tone. Why is there an outcry against it (at least in several reviews)? As I see it, this film has been advertised to the wrong audience. It appears as though the studio marketing people suddenly pushed it as an action blockbuster when they realized Ang Lee had made a much more intellectual, darker take on the comic series than they thought he would have. They panicked and wanted to try the big-opening-weekend tactic to generate money. I read all the negative reviews and went into it without high hopes. But I was blown away. The effects shots, while mostly very well done, are the least important to me. Ang has made real human characters out if these roles. Truth is, Ang's Hulk is a psychological story about childhood trauma and dealing with parents and their control. The real subtext is children having to deal with the choices their parents made...when it inevitably shapes who they are as adults. It could have been told against a more mundane background, but the Hulk part of it just gives it a fun twist. The characters are forced into situations beyond their control, yet they have to to try and deal with it nonetheless. Bruce is emotionally distant due to a fractured childhood (a protective response)...Betty is obsessed with trying to emotionally ""open up"" such a guy, since she could never do that to her military father (and thus fix their relationship). The two lead characters (Bruce & Betty) love each other deeply, but events and psychological scars conspire against them...and ultimately separate them. This is a classic tragedy story. I think people aren't used to that and they have a very strong negative reaction. The expectation was for lighthearted, humorous summer fluff, but they got handed heavy Greek tragedy instead. No wonder the negative reviews. All I can say is that I will definitely be paying to see this film again while it's in the theaters. I expect a lot of people to ""not get it."" Those who do will hold this film in high regards. I agree that Ang Lee is one of the most talented directors of our time. Highly recommended if characters mean more to you than action.",Hulk

585,almdudler,A train wreck for comic-based films,3,21 June 2003,"I was eager to see this one. As a frame of reference, I loved Spiderman, X-2, and thought Daredevil was so-so. The Hulk strikes me as lagging behind even Daredevil as the weakest entry in the comic book-based movies of late. It was truly a groaner, and the audience I was with seemed to react the same way. Here are the points against this film:1. The tone was entirely wrong, both for fans of the comic, and I would add, entirely wrong for fans of action films. The trailers clearly billed this as an action film, not a heavy, brooding drama. That said, I had read reviews indicating that Ang Lee had placed a heavy emphasis on the story and character development, so I was actually excited because a comic book movie doesn't need to be superficial. However, there was no humor, no levity at all. It was painful. We've been conditioned with action films to have a few light-hearted moments here and there as a catharsis from the weightiness of conflict, but there were absolutely no intended humorous moments in this film. The only humor, unfortunately, came during very dramatic moments, as I found myself and the audience laughing at some rather corny lines and poor acting by the lead, Eric Bana. I will add that there is a scene toward the end where two characters are talking on a stage-like apparatus; it's supposed to be a moving moment, but instead, it was over-the-top and had the feeling of high school theatrics.2.  Filmic technique - I admit this is more according to my personal taste, but Mr. Lee used a lot of split-screens throughout the film. It was okay the first time, and indeed, they may have been impressively and seemlessly spliced/integrated into the film, but they were used far too often and distracted me. In fact, I had flashbacks to the 80's when my friends got their first camcorders and tried out all the panning and dissolving effects that they could. The film started to have that same cheap 80's experimental camcorder feel to it. Many of the multiple shots did nothing to serve the action. For example, three panes showing helicopters coming to fight The Hulk did nothing for me. It didn't reveal anything new to me.3.  Special effects - I agree with others who have expressed that the CGI just wasn't up to the task of depicting the Hulk. I thought the distant shots worked well enough, but the close-ups showed a creature slightly less believable than the original hand-puppet yoda. There were also a few scenes that looked very sloppily done. There's an explosion at one point, and the person being blown up had a cartoonish outline around him/her and was suspended in the air. I saw audience members groan and look at each other like ""was that supposed to look real?"" It was pitiful.4.  Convoluted plot - I would think that in most cases an action film has better pacing when the storyline is kept fairly simple or at the very least is coherent. Had the filmmakers chosen to stay true to the origins of the Hulk from the comic book, I think it would have worked much better. Instead, they spent a lot of time with techno/pseudo/medical jargon and psychobabble in making a storyline that was too complicated and tripped over itself many time. I was so sick of hearing the term 'repressed memories' thrown around by the end of the film. Too much talking about the main character's problems and too little showing. We were beat over the head with pseudo-heady dialogue at times that sounded like sci-fi crap, and Lee's surreal shots of molecules didn't help.5. Poor lead actor - This will be a common refrain, but the lead, Eric Bana was a terrible choice. He was like a wooden version of Keanu Reeves, if you can conceive of that (Reeves is bad enough). The guy wilted every scene he was in, drained any energy and drama that the scene had to offer. I felt no sympathy for the character; he was like an android.That's probably enough to make my point, but I could go on. Unfortunately, there aren't many positive points to make. There were some decent action sequences in the film, but not enough to warrant the time that I spent in the theatre. A definite thumbs-down for me.",Hulk
586,garyhobson,Awful,2,18 July 2007,"This movie was awful. It starts off slow and takes far too long to get to the action. Everything up to that point where Bruce Banner transforms to the Hulk was incredibly boring. Far too many drawn out scenes of talking. Just yabber yabber yabber. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for talking. But not this much. About 10-15mins into the movie, we already get the idea. Yeah yeah, it's Bruce Banner. Mad scientist. Good looking girl in there. Father is a big army boy, whatever. So lets get to the action! No, more and more pointless talking. It's just shoved in your face, teasing you for the time wasted.There simply wasn't enough action. People are paying money to watch the Hulk smash stuff. SMASH!!! The best part of the movie was when the Hulk fights the 3 mutant dogs. And when he rips apart the tank. Really that was all the good stuff. Everything outside of those 2 moments were super boring. The bit where he jumps between the mountains, well that was sort of silly. I'm just glad I didn't see this in cinemas.",Hulk
587,CoolDan,The Hulk: A deeply confused movie.,7,22 June 2003,"If I could describe The Hulk in one word, it would be confused. Everything about this movie is either confused or confusing, and you may get confused as to why the movie is so confused. Now, don't get me wrong, there are many good qualities about this movie. The acting, the action and the visual effects are all excellent. There are ambitions about this movie that are very brave and daring. But they all seem inferior when you look at the movie as a whole, because in that perspective, it just does not all hang together. The movie is confused about what it wants to be, where it wants to go, where it wants to begin, where it wants to end, when it wants to start, and when it wants to stop. It's confused about how fast or slow it should go. It's confused about what to emphasize and what to downplay. And the most annoying confusion is how many comic-bookish transitions and split-screens it should use, because there are waayyy too many. It gets pretty irritating after a while. Even in the most inappropriate scenes for these transitions and split-screens, there they are. And there are many moments when the movie seems to be building to something high, but then wimps out. Almost everything about this movie is indecided and lost, and thus the movie really suffers. There were actions and decisions made about the movie and scenes included that had my mind boggled as to why they happened, or why they were there. Some of the experience of watching this movie was frustrating and trying, rather than thrilling or moving. Sure, some scenes are thrilling and some scenes are moving, but it just doesn't help the fact that the movie is deeply confused. Maybe it's because Ang Lee was confused when he directed this. After all, I'd probably be a little confused if I were an acclaimed director stepping into a comic book flick. All I know is when the DVD comes out, I want to watch this movie with director's commentary on. I have many questions about the movie, but somehow I doubt there are very good answers. And that in a nutshell is my big problem with this movie.
I give this movie a 7/10. I'm torn as to whether this score is too low or too high, but this is the way I think I feel about this movie for now. But what I do know for certain is that it falls way behind comic book movies like X2 and Spider-Man, and this movie, more often than not, is lost and confused. But it's worth seeing once, I guess, if you're curious.",Hulk
588,ironman9932,Hulk Brought to life,10,21 January 2011,"Hulk is one of the best Marvel heroes ever. I remember seeing this film back when it first came out and being astonished to to finally see him on the big screen. The special effects are outstanding and the Hulk looks so real you could just reach out and touch him. Eric Bana did an excellent job, as well as Sam Elliot and the rest of the cast. And the action sequences were all heart thumping to say the least. And the icing on top of it all, Danny Elfman delivers a grand score that makes the movie ever more involving. Many bash it, but I view it as one of the best superhero films. At times the pacing is a tad off, I'll admit, the only real consensus being that audiences did not want deep characters and a plot that made you think. They just wanted more action and a trimmed down storyline. Sounds about right.",Hulk
589,falkar,A Noble Failure,6,5 June 2004,"It's sad to see so many people lay into ""Hulk"", saying it's dull, confusing and has far too little Hulk in it. While I didn't exactly love the film, I would like to speak in it's defense here. I believe that the relative failure of ""Hulk"" was down to the fact he isn't as iconic or popular a character as Spider-Man, Batman or the X-Men. Also, it is hard to relate to CGI characters and at times I'm sure the audience felt alienated from him. Now, I'll agree that Hulk had to be CG but ILM's effort didn't seem that convincing, especially when compared to the dinos in Jurassic Park or Gollum. Also, the marketing campaign was terrible-all the kiddy tie in merchandise and the Hulk filled clips, making it look like any regular summer movie. So when people sat down and saw it was a physcho dramatic movie about hidden potential and inner demons, I'm sure they shifted uncomfortably. In the age of dumbing down, Hulk seems lost. People seem to complain that the film was ""dumbing up"". I also want to point out the common complaint that Hulk doesn't appear until 40 minutes in. Well, compared to the 58 minutes of ""Superman"" or the 47 minutes of ""Spider-Man"" this is quite speedy (although the fugure on Spidey doesn't include the bit when he is in sweats.) The actual film is indeed flawed, but there is a lot to like-strong performances all round (especially from Bana and Nolte, who ""tantrum"" moment is a highlight.), the effects for the most part are stunning and it continues the tradition of serious, edgy comic movies. Sadly, this movies disappointing performance may make Hollywood nervous about making a sequel or making comic movies serious, meaning that we may go back to more ""Batman and Robin"" level A-Grade trash.Score-7/10",Hulk
590,Aspie33,Good but not great,10,9 February 2004,"Okay, where do I begin? When I first saw previews for this film, I didn't really know what to think. Not really being able to go into a movie theater, I decided to buy the soundtrack first. Loved the soundtrack, but craved more. Finally, when ""The Hulk"" came on video sometime in October, my mother bought it for me and I watched it immediately.Again, I didn't know what to expect. For starters, the movie begins with maverick scientist David Banner (played as a young adult by Paul Kersey and in his later years by Nick Nolte) experimenting with the human body's ability to heal itself from disease and injury. Forbidden to experiment on humans by his (somewhat?) nemesis General Ross (played as a young adult by Todd Tesen and later by Sam Elliott), David decides to experiment on himself and later, his wife bears a son, Bruce. Years later, Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a scientist like dear old dad also experimenting with using gamma radiation to repair damaged cells. Having grown up in a foster home after his parents supposedly died and plagued by a considerable amount of emotional turmoil and an inability to open up emotionally, Bruce's relationship with co-worker Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) has suffered to the point where they have broken up but still work together. Bruce's experimentations catch the eye of high-and-mighty Glenn Talbot (Josh Lucas) who plans to take the project and tries to con both Bruce and Betty into working for him, but they both refuse. Then, one day, something goes wrong with a gamma ray-emitting device and Bruce rushes to aid of a co-worker, throwing himself in the path of lethal gamma rays. While he survives what would normally kill a human being, Bruce's life is forever changed as now, whenever under extreme stress or rage, he transforms into a 15-foot mass of green monster that later becomes known as the Hulk. General Ross, who turns out to be Betty's father, takes notice and seeks to capture (and then destroy) the Hulk while David Banner comes around and begins stalking this troubled but docile son. Soon, all hell breaks loose as various characters (Talbot, General Ross, and even Betty included) make one poor decision after another, but I won't spoil you with the exact details.The plot was fine as it gave a more reasonable explanation for how Bruce survives what would usually kill a human. The only thing great about this movie was the music, courtesy of Danny Elfman. The acting was fine, but nothing that could warrant an Academy Award nomination (no offense). Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Sam Elliott, Josh Lucas, and Nick Nolte all handled their parts well. On Bana's part, this is something Christopher Reeve could've pulled off if only this film were made in the late 1970's and if Reeve hadn't done ""Superman"" (no offense). On Nolte's part, his performance was something Christopher Walken could do in his sleep. Overall, this movie was good but not great like last year's ""Spider-Man"". In my humble opinion, the musical soundtrack and the novelization by Peter David is a bit better than the film.I give this film about a 4 of 10 on a scale of 1-10.",Hulk

592,sadclownrep,Excellent Comic Book to Screen Adaptation,8,18 December 2003,"The failure of ""The Hulk"" was one of marketing.  People went in, perhaps, with a certain set of expectations based on the trailers (""Oh, it will be just like 'the X-Men'"") and instead found a much more ""artsy"" film.  When you want to see super villains and explosions and, instead, get psychological depth and pathos, you are bound to be a little disappointed.That being said, I found ""The Hulk"" to be a pleasant surprise.  There are many things to recommend it, but I would like to focus on the editing. This is, in my opinion, one of the first movies based on a comic book that actually looked like a comic book.  Split and multiple screens allowed Lee to give us multiple reaction shots all at the same time.  This was, for me, great fun.Every writer and artist who take over the comic book take it in their own direction.  I believe Lee did the same thing when he took charge of this project.  Lee's ""Hulk"" isn't an awful lot like the one in the TV series or the most recent comic book versions, but it is one worth visiting - without any preconceptions about style or content.",Hulk

594,rat_202,Smashing Hulk,6,2 December 2017,"This movie proved to be VERY divisive upon release. We heard the now familiar rumblings of 'superhero fatigue,' and talk that the comic book bubble was about to burst - and this was fourteen years ago!Let's be fair - Hulk is not a bad movie. Ang Lee doesn't know how to make a bad movie. Having said that, was he the right guy for this movie? Hmmm... The story comes across more as an art-house type Greek tragedy than a superhero flick, when people really just want to see The Hulk and The Abomination pummelling each other. They did so in the Incredible Hulk, a lame reboot nobody went to see. The action beats, when they do eventually come, are pretty impressive. We see Big Green taking on tanks, helicopters and, er, poodles. The Hulk himself looks really weird now. People were criticising the CGI even then, and of course, time has not improved it. It would be a while before they would get the Hulk right. One thing that I hadn't seen before was the framing of some shots in the style of comic book panels, a technique later borrowed by other comic-book movies (see Kick-Ass). Eventually Marvel realised that The Hulk works better as a supporting character than as a lead, but Hulk remains and underrated curio.",Hulk
595,smvouriot,surprising art film,8,23 July 2012,"Hulk is a very surprising film. When I first saw it when I was like nine or ten I was confused, shocked and somewhat disappointed. My expectations at the time had not been met. What I had been expecting and hoping was just endless scenes of the hulk smashing sh#t up. What I got was an art film. At the time I didn't understand or care about any of the split screens, dream sequences, etc, I was just waiting for the hulk to show up and destroy stuff.(The hulk dosen't show up till about 40 minutes into the movie, by the way.) I eventually began to get restless because it is a very slow movie and when it was over I felt very disappointed.A few years later I bought the DVD to give it another try, and I was very surprised with how good it actually was, now that I had gotten older and could appreciate the style, acting and pretty much everything else. The acting is quite good in the film, especially Nick Nolte, who almost steals the show as Bruce Banner's father, David Banner. Eric Bana is decent as the hulk, but I prefer Mark Ruffalo as the hulk in the avengers. Unlike other movies based on comic books, Hulk actually looks like a comic book, due to the split screens. This works most of the time,as it gives the film a unique look thats different from other comic book movies.Now to the much criticised CGI, which for me is a mixed bag. The close ups of the hulk work, because his facial expressions are well done and you can actually feel sympathy for him. However the long shots of him, especially in the desert scenes, look a bit cheesy but definitely not as bad as some critics have been saying. Apart from that the visual effects are top notch.Overall, Hulk is a refreshing change from standard and bland superhero movies. It takes its time setting up the plot and characters, which works because you have almost fully fleshed out characters and not cardboard cut outs. The repressed memories and psychology of the hulk is much more interesting than the standard heroics of superman or captain America. So to sum it up, I wouldn't recommend this movie to young kids because there are a number of intense scenes and it is a fairly long and slow movie, so those with short attention spans won't be well rewarded. But for those who are prepared to accept that it is more an art film than an action film then you will be well rewarded.The film isn't perfect, but every time I watch it on DVD it grows on me and I find myself wishing sometimes that more action blockbusters were like this, but then if they were I doubt they would be blockbusters.",Hulk
596,brockmporter,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,1,15 June 2005,"""Hulk"" was, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was missing some very basic elements, which I will recount for you now.The first thing I notice was the conspicuous absence of a plot. This movie was deathly slow. By the time anything happens, you're so tired of waiting for something to happen that the payoff simply isn't worth it. What happens is this: a guy (Eric Bana as Bruce Banner) becomes the Hulk, and they military doesn't like it, so they fight him. Also, Banner's father (Nick Nolte) shows up for some reason and is revealed to be some sort of weird, crazy guy who is also a doctor, apparently, who also fights him, although we're never entirely sure why (we'll get to him in a minute).The directing was terrible. Yes, terrible. I've heard criticisms that I just didn't understand the film, but frankly, what's to understand? The director was trying to make a movie that watches like a comic book, which is a mind-numbingly stupid idea. He utilizes split-screen shots to try to emulate comic book panels, overlooking the fact that comic-book panels are a limitation when trying to present action to an audience-- a limitation that thankfully the medium of movies can circumvent. Not this one though. The director, apparently completely unaware that he was doing a movie based on a comic book, tried to be artistic.The characters were all terrible. I don't blame the actors; the cast was in fact pretty incredible. But the characters were terribly written. No sympathy, no empathy, and no development. Bruce Banner was apparently some sort of personality amputee, although it may be by some birth defect that he was simply born without one. Trying to care about this character was a chore in itself, and detracted from what little there was to enjoy about this movie altogether. Again, I can't blame Bana for this, it was a badly-written character, but I have to say, acting like nothing doesn't really count as acting. Nor is it in any way entertaining to watch. The love-interest, Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) is extremely lukewarm. She's the ingénue, who loves-him-because-she-knows-what's-right, despite the fact that Bruce Banner has all the lovable personality traits of a toilet plunger, but with a tendency to rip the heads off puppies because he gets cut off in traffic. The chemistry between them is bland at best, and quite frankly, someone who looks like Jennifer Connelly could do much better.By far the worst character was Bruce's estranged father (Nolte) who shows up out of nowhere and rambles incessantly in an irritatingly mumbled voice like some sort of hobo with a Ph.D. . This sort of thing goes on for tedious minutes on end before one stops wondering ""What in the hell is he talking about?"" and begins wondering ""when is this scene going to end?"". Father (for that's his name) also develops an unlikely super-power, which he describes, in typical form, as the ability to ""partake with the essences of things,"" which essentially means he can become stuff. (Admittedly, the visuals here were actually pretty cool. Not cool enough to make up for having to hear him describe it in prolonged bouts of Ivy-League gibberish, though). In the end, Nolte and his son fight for some reason (I think because he's a weird, crazy nut-ball, and Bruce is just a guy who fights people), Nolte partakes with the essence of some lightning and strikes Bruce, and presumably the whole thing is over, except that, for no reason whatsoever, Banner emerges several months later in the amazon, telling some South American drug lords ""you wouldn't like me when I'm angry,"" at which point I actually found myself in throes of agony in the movie theater thinking ""Dear God, he survived, they're setting up a sequel.""In short, a man who turns into a giant green monster and tears buildings in half when he gets mad should be quite exciting enough to hold my attention for an hour and a half. If you can make tedium out of that, you might want to reconsider what line of work you belong in.",Hulk
597,ajbru,Highly Underrated,7,13 February 2006,"People are way too harsh on this movie. I'm not too sure what people were expecting, maybe something like Spiderman. But people seem to forget that Spiderman and the Incredible Hulk are two totally different types of hero. The Hulk is more or less hated by allies and enemies alike, because of his angry nature. But as for the movie, the special effects were awesome, the story did well with more or less sticking to the comics, and Ang Lee's constant use of frames to change scenes give this movie even more of a comic book feel to it than Spiderman or X-Men ever did. The acting is also great, Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly do wonderfully in their roles, as does Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot. If you're looking for a more serious comic-based movie, definitely watch it. It's a truly under-appreciated film.",Hulk
598,dleroari,Best movie,10,28 August 2020,"One of the greatest movies ever seen. The effects, storyline, actors everything is perfect assembled. This is what marvel should be about, not mixing all heroes.",Hulk
599,UltraJoe,"Excellent, when taken on its own merits",9,21 June 2003,"This, to me, was a movie exploring characters, not the bang-up action that some may want. As far as Marvel movies go, it probably strides the farthest away from the original tale, but, when taken on its own, it works well.The movie isn't all ""Hulk Smash!"" which is a good thing in my opinion. We see rage personified in Bruce Banner's alter-ego, along with the temptation to finally be free of the heavy control over one's emotions. The special effects were great (although there were some times when it was fairly obvious the Hulk was CG), but the movie wasn't about special effects. It was used to tell a story rather effectively.",Hulk
600,RichNice,Tried to do too much in one movie....,4,22 June 2003,"Simple as that.  It appeared the director and screenwriter attempted to go the ""Spiderman"" route and give you a great story, and then end the last half of the movie with great action.  They got it half right.  While the action was great (once it finally got there), it seemed the script was too rushed, the dialogue too forced, and character interaction to generic.  I can understand wanting to give the moviegoer as much information as you can about Banner's/Hulk's origin, too much was forced in one sitting.  Maybe it's not the director's fault more so than the editor who should have paced the story better.  Well I give it a 5 out of 10 (and that's because I love the Hulk comics).",Hulk
601,wilyum,Exceeded my expectations,8,3 August 2003,"thanks to all the bad reviews this movie got this movie I went to see it without any expectations even though The Hulk was always one of my favs, and I have to say I really really enjoyed it, I can't understand what everyone was going on about, the SFX were great and unlike Spiderman and X-men I felt a degree of tension and actuallyempathised with the characters.Seems so many people have judged this movie based on their preconceptions of what a summer superhero movie should be like.",Hulk
602,mashcity,"Nice try, or was it?",3,22 June 2003,"This movie had such potential, now it needs to quietly go away to the video store!  How can a movie with such potential and star appeal go so very wrong?  Perhaps the Hulk doesn't have all the story lines that Spiderman & Superman have or perhaps we prefer our super heros to be more than special effects.",Hulk
603,rob-437,"Ah, so that's what they call character detail...",8,30 July 2003,"Finally, after the recent action/Marvel comic book transfers we have a film, not driven by the words summer cash in and wants to tell a story about people.Not since the days of being shown the messed up minds of the Joker and Mr Wayne, have we really been given the opportunity to see what makes Characters inject themselves with jellyfish antibodies and starfish gunk...The Hulk uses a substantial amount of the viewing time given the background to the creation the character, without loosing the focus on the storyline or in fact cutting back on the action, and this is the next thing that really sticks out from the film.  The cost of feeding someone that much and painting them green was obviously going to be too much of a cost so CG has taken over to provide a character that is not over the top in either actions, size, ability and most importantly interaction with surroundings, making it believable that a 20 or so foot green hulk in running around the Nevada deserts.Photography has obviously been thought about as well, as the greeness of the hulk stands out on the bleak surroundings of the desert and the metallic finish and concrete gray of the military institutes.  Ang Lee has made sure that the film does have enough substance to make it enjoyable to watch and really get into and still leaving in some action to make you smile.  A must for comic book conversion junkies as well as general movie-goers....",Hulk
604,jmcgarmott,Character-driven drama,10,16 July 2003,"Hey, the film's actually not bad! I walked out of the theater feeling slightly dizzy, a feeling I get after watching movies such as The Pianist or The Hours. What that implies is that Ang Lee was probably trying for another Oscar, somehow, though hardly in the acting department (not that Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly weren't good, just that ... comic-book Oscar winners, anyone?). They do have a chance in editing and a slight one in special effects though. People who watch this film should, as most of the other positive-reviewers agree, watch this as a drama - go in with your expectations programmed like you're going to watch Road To Perdition or something. The action is more a representation of his anger, and I loved how intense it was. There were even attempts to make it look realistic in an already unrealistic Hulk-comic-book world - the way Hulk landed he stil had to hop another step to break his jump. Basically, it's all about emotions. Just that, all about emotions (that means you, the audience, not only the movie).",Hulk
605,jmcgarmott,Hulk - Oscar Winner,10,26 November 2003,"Many people have commented on this film and they belong to either of these two groups - those who think it's boring (maybe they saw the green lights and thought it was The Matrix) and didn't understand what was going on (yup, like philosophy) and then when the action happens it's cool except that it's unbelievable that Hulk didn't drop his pants when he shrank (yeah, right, now that would be both realistic and in good taste ...). The others understand what Ang Lee is trying to do (without having to really analyse the film, in case some people think that is the case), enjoys the seriousness and graveness the film presents, and think that when the action happens it's downright cool and entertaining too.I belong to the latter group (anyone who's able to work that out does deserve some prize - currently the split is 50/50). The name Ang Lee would have sounded alarm bells in the first place - for me it sounded like 'WHAT?!' Then was the anticipation - the studios have made an interesting choice ... it would really be interesting to see how the film turned out to be like. It's so long since I've been to a film where its contents are unexpected - unlike every other film nowadays, through either the trailer, synopsis or review you know some of the stuff that will appear on screen, so that what was original when the script was penned suddenly became a cliche simply because you experienced the film from all three sources. And when I finally saw it - wow. I was half-dizzy from the experience - my brain was numb, couldn't think, not even of what the whole thing fully meant. All I knew was it was a good movie - it told a story, acknowledged its roots without distracting (those who were distracted by the you-know-what probably have short concentration spansanyway), and also surprised me. I didn't know the Hulk could jump, run and hop like that, but it was interesting that he did. It was real - just let yourself believe that it is real in the world of the film and you will enjoy it, as simple as that. Instead certain people chose to pay with their hard-earned cash and go in with a set expectation of what's going to happen (under 2 hours of smashing stuff) and refusing to let that expectation go even when it was clearly wrong, even if letting it go means enjoying the film. As for his pants? It was a special material that could stretch by a large amount - they're the military, they have enough money to spend on this stuff. Now enough about the pants, coz I'm more interested in seeing what happens next with the relationship between Bruce and Betty and his father ...Point is, this film is aiming for the Oscars. Best Editing (hey, JFK won remember?), Best Sound (notice the sound used when Hulk is running), Best Cinematography (the shot of the helicopter flying above the waters was stunning), Best Special Effects, Best Direction - and Best Picture. The signs are all there. It won't win Best Picture, but see that it gets nominated. The cast won't get a nomination, but that's not because they did it badly. Some people complained that Eric Bana wasn't explosive enough - erm, anyone with a sober brain would realise that he is playing a quiet introvert here. There is a point to choosing someone who's capable of exploding to play someone whose explosionshappen within and not without - Bruce Banner might almost never explode but you feel it subconsciously. (But of course I'm being idealistic. The Academy Awards are not about awarding awards and nomination to the right winners, but to wade between the heavy pressure of anticipation of the press and the audience in general. For example, how many people understood what was the theme of The Hours?)Some people complain about the film being a franchise and all and that the ending suggests a sequel. Yes it does, but I'm comforted by the fact that if (unfortunately it's a BIG IF, thanks to all the film-bashers out there) there is a sequel, no one else can take over and still maintain the same tone and style of this film and hence will be an abomination (take the case of Brian De Palma vs John Woo). It can only be directed by Ang Lee.P.S. - For the record, I thought it was great that the film was 2 hours and 20 minutes. If there is a sequel it had better be as long as that.",Hulk
606,mafox,"Some fun stuff, but mostly boring",5,25 June 2003,"My wife and I went to the hulk expecting another typical Hollywood check-your-brain-at-the-door action movie.  We got that, but we also got all this extra character development.  Why?  I don't know.  It wasn't interesting nor necessary for the development of the plot.  We also got about 15 minutes of some really beautiful visuals.  Salt flats, hoodoos, water, clouds, lichen on trees, lizards, sea-life, and much much more.  But come on, 15 minutes worth?!?After the first hour, things started to get moving, then we get a fifteen minute reprieve from anything that would keep us awake.  Then, FINALLY, in the last half-hour of the movie things get fun.There's some really clever stuff here.  (The dogs were great.)  There's also some pretty stupid stuff.  (Dad's power?  What animal did that come from?) The Hulk looks really really good.  Hats off to the CG crew (and I've got on MSc in CG).  Connely doesn't look half-bad either, and doesn't do a bad job of looking distraught and confused.  But more than anything, this movie delivers a lot of boredom.Shave half-an-hour of boring footage, rework Mr. Banner senior's power, throw in another Hulk rampage, and you'd have had a fun film.  As is?  Well, do yourself a favour and bring something to read.",Hulk
607,pksoze22,Sometimes directors & movies don't match,5,23 April 2005,"I am a fan of the character of the Hulk. Not only did I watch the Bill Bixby series but I collected the comics for years. I am also an Ang Lee fan I found the Ice Storm to be brilliant and enjoyed Crouching Tiger. So what could go wrong? Turns out plenty.In the comics the origin was a guy saves a kid from a gamma bomb and the radiation makes him the Hulk. Well, in this movie its not that simple. There is no bomb it has been scrapped. And the gamma radiation is only a part of why he becomes the Hulk, the other part was his crazy dad experimented with him which interacted with the gamma rays. Then Bruce is adopted and is not even called Banner until midway through the movie. Does that sound jumbled and needlesly complicated? It does to me.The actors do a good job with the exception of Nolte who is way over the top. Bana is OK as Banner and Connely is good as Betty. But the film suffers from pacing issues and spends way to much time before he Hulks out.The movie actually shines when the Hulk appears but the needlesly complicated origin, an over the top performances by Nolte, and the glacial pace hurt the movie. I think Ang would have done better with a better script but sometimes certain types of directors can't make certain movies. I know I wouldn't want to see Von Trier's Superman no matter how talented he is.",Hulk
608,pspmichael,Disappointing to say the least,7,11 May 2004,"I grew up reading the Hulk comic books and watching him on TV.  The Hulk has always been something that one could relate to.  Superior strength in the face of danger or bad guys.  This movie turned the Hulk into something too far out there to relate to.  Leaping over deserts, falling from the rim of space and then taking a swim, tossing tanks around like they were made of plastic, all much too far beyond what the Hulk really is.The editing was very distracting with it's split screens all to often.  It reminded me more of a first year college student trying to impress someone. The split screens were completely distracting and a waste of time.All in all, the movie dragged on mercilessly which equates to boring.  It was not the Hulk we grew up to know and the split screen action was dumb. It's a real shame they did this to the Hulk.",Hulk

When I sat down to watch this film I was mildly shaking with anticipation and my adrenaline level was increased, I was so engrossed in this film. The background information on Banner was an important element to the film  and when the hulk appeared first of all I was in awe. The amount of work gone into the detail of the Hulk I can only applaud the guys at ILM for.The Desert scenes were breathtaking and the whole cinematography was awesome, everything about this film was awesome. Some have critized this film on its lack of humour and tendencey to  be dark, this is basically a tragic story of a mans affliction with a disease, its not meant to be light hearted, and funny.This film is not meant to be like spiderman in any way, its darker and more intelligent its  witty and truly is a work of art.  I thank the whole production team for bringing back a character I have loved since I was a young boy.  I eagerly await the sequel. This film may not be for every one, perhaps children found the first 45 minutes boring as did some adults but hey it needs a good story, and I felt it lead to a great climax in the film ,the acting was superb, and was pretty much an adult film.

613,david-1230,Plot smarter than its shrubs.,6,25 January 2006,"What a strange and interesting beast of a film. I rather enjoyed it for its pathos and its camp exploration of Bruce's psyche, i enjoyed it for its restrained pacing, i enjoyed it for its lack of cliché in the face of what has got to be one of the stupidest plots this side of King Kong (it is a comic book after all). I enjoyed it rather a lot, that is until the green one started leaping all over the Utah, precipitating a war with his deranged father and generally spoiling all the good work of the previous hour. At that point it just got boring and i promptly fell asleep. Hmmm. Why you may ask? Isn't action what we are paying for here? No, it really didn't seem so to start with, and that's how i was suckered into watching the thing. To me the film initially seemed to be quiet a good attempt at circumventing the idiocy of the original comic book plot and delivering itself as a decent, light hearted, scientific paranoia thriller with a discerning lack of accursed mutants and such-forth to spoil what might have been a nice little plot. Of course this wasn't to be; my desire for Banner to reveal himself as an enraged and perhaps slightly larger than life version of Erica Bana, released from the burden of torn clothes and that dreadfully painful looking change of complexion experienced each time he gets vaguely annoyed was, well, flattened by the rapid emergence of an awfully rendered CGI green bull of a 25 foot tall man out the roof of a laboratory with a healthy comic book zest for destruction. Very, very boring. I was lying on the couch thinking, why couldn't Ang Lee have just gone:'Okay, we have this character right, and for some reason he turns green and monstrous each time someone pushes the wrong buttons. Very silly. Okay, now, how about we change it to when he gets massively disgruntled he can't control himself and smashes *hit up like the big comic book guy - but lets, for the sake of keeping to the script i've already half written, not make him 25 feet tall, green and able to jump like a giant flea all over the place but someone who has a massive personality shift and a perhaps humongous amount of adrenalin each time someone throws sand in is face and then we just let him loose on the world. Ooo, and hey, lets not turn the ending into a Manga style nobody-understands-nobody-else-chaos-freakout.""Why didn't he say that? Because if they did that it wouldn't be The Hulk then would it? My problem then is that the film is just far to intellectual in its initial plotting for its own good. With a central character possessing an intellect the size of a shrub any small amount of intelligence is going to be wasted. Its a tragic fact that stupid characters will always ruin any half good idea by stomping all over it. A likely reason why King Kong has been so popular is that it doesn't have this kind of two mind thing going on. The plot IS as stupid as its central character and that seems to help out somewhat. Bruce Banner's Hulk is big and stupid. Ang Lee's The Hulk initially was slim and smart, then the beast took over. And a damn shame because we seem to end up with a somewhat schizophrenic film that seems to justify itself by not making any sense in its finale. Oh well.",Hulk
614,villiards,Good start; bad finish!,4,24 May 2006,"Ang Lee tends to be quite good at directing action movies, but his efforts fall short in ""Hulk."" Based on the long-running Marvel Comics series ""The Incredible Hulk,"" Lee presents us with the story of David ""Bruce"" Banner (played by Eric Bana), a genetic scientist who's life is dramatically changed when he is exposed to a large dose of gamma radiation. As a result, whenever Banner becomes angry or feels threatened, he morphs into a gigantic, green monster known as the Hulk. As the Hulk, Banner is completely ruled by his own rage, and capable of destroying practically anything in his path. He is seemingly indestructible and unstoppable, until his anger fades away, and he reverts back to his normal, human form.The Hulk is not without his enemies. Once his new found alter-ego is discovered, Banner finds himself continually hounded by a decorated Army General (Sam Elliot) who wants to use the Hulk as a weapon, a jealous reporter who is fighting for the affection of David Banner's love interest, and Banner's own estranged father (Nick Nolte) who has his own sinister ideas for pursuing the Hulk.In the beginning of this film, Lee gives us a good story. While the characters never really develop into anything fantastic, viewers can actually find themselves feeling sorry for Banner as he struggles to make sense of his life, which is now turning upside down with the addition of the Hulk and the return of his real father. Both of these events bring up issues from Banner's past which he has repressed, and seemingly must confront if he ever wants to control the beast the rages inside of him.About half-way through, however, the pace quickens and the movie quickly starts to degenerate into a mess. The Hulk goes on a rampage to avoid being captured by the military, and eventually ends up having to face a super villain, which is actually Banner's father, who has exposed himself to gamma radiation in order to gain super powers similar to his son's. For as good, and interesting the first part of this movie is, the latter part has the feel of watching someone play a video game. Its filled with little more than a bunch of extended scenes that feature the Hulk demolishing tanks and planes, jumping over canyons, and eventually beating up a giant monster at the end. Now, while I will acknowledge that this is what the Hulk commonly does in the comic books (smash and break things, that is) and that this is probably what everyone in the audience was waiting for, it still could've been done much better and in a way that helps enhance the story. As it is, these later scenes of destruction go way too long, and sometimes comes across as being meaningless and over-the-top.This film has some good actors in it, but the characters never really develop very far, and none of the actors ever seem to truly get into their roles. Eric Bana doesn't do a bad job of playing David Banner, but something in his performance is still lacking, and he fails to fully convince viewers of what his character is thinking or feeling. Really, about the only actor who seems to do really well in his role is Sam Elliot, but playing a grizzled Army tough-guy is nothing new for him, so that's pretty much expected.It was a good try at a making a movie about a popular comic book, but overall, its not very satisfying and could've been done better. Fans of the comic book and the 1980's television series will still enjoy this film, but many of them will probably feel as though something is missing, too.",Hulk
615,shaofutzer,Best comic to movie adaptation so far.,7,4 February 2005,"If you're going to let people like ""princessleia912"" influence your decision to watch this movie, then you're going to miss out on the best comic to movie adaptation thus far. The aforementioned reviewer made the uneducated comment about PCR not being around in 1965 when it's obvious the movie never took place during 1965. If it was supposed to be 1965, then Bruce Banner (in the movie) would be pushing 42 when he first becomes the Hulk. I don't think so. It's more believable that he was in his twenties - which is plausible because the PCR machine was invented by Mullis in 1985 (which is twenty years later, not thirty - obviously math was not a prerequisite at the lab Miss Leia worked at). After re-watching the film I found absolutely no time reference. Anyway - don't you think a top secret government lab would have access to advanced technology before the public does? Besides - it was a movie! If you're going to nitpick - then you should hate almost every Hollywood movie ever. If you're going to down a movie because of its lack of biological accuracy - then shouldn't you feel equally miffed about all the people who get blown many feet backward when shot by hand-held firearms? That's physically impossible. So are the laws of physics to be overlooked? I think ""princessleia912"" needs to take elementary general science again. I really wish people would think before they posted comments about movies here.Anyhow, you're reading this because you want to learn about the Hulk movie aren't you? Not to read the idiotic ranting of someone who thinks they know something (princessleia912). So I'll give you my take on the movie now.I really enjoyed it. Sure it seemed to drag for just a minute, but the movie more than made up for it with the ton of action it delivered at the end. Although there was 45 minutes of character development to contend with - the last hour or so is pure action-packed Hulk-smash goodness. ""Depicting the military as evil"" was pretty much the theme in the original Incredible Hulk TV series - so to bring up that point is just wrong. If you liked the original show, then this movie will blow you away. If you're a fan of the comic book, you'll love this adaptation. With so many crap translations such as Daredevil and Spiderman, this movie truly surprised me by being extremely faithful to the look and feel of the comic. The CG was awesome and as good or better than anything I've ever seen in a movie - and I'm extremely picky when it comes to CG use. If you're going to talk badly about the CG in this film - then you surely must hate the CG in films such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which in my opinion was not an ounce better than this film. ILM handled the eye-candy marvelously. To whoever said The Hulk didn't look like Eric Bana - what movie were you watching? You obviously downloaded the pre-production screener off the internet or something. They couldn't have made him look anymore like the actor who played Bruce Banner without pasting his face to the Hulk's body. This movie was expertly directed right down to the excellent transition effects that take place between nearly every major scene in the movie, giving the whole thing a very comic book feel - much more so than ANY movie ever made.I don't want to spoil anything for you or set your expectations too high, as obviously some people are stricken with bandwagonosis. So I'm just going to let you decide - but do yourself a favor and don't let some of these movie thieves, nitpickers, Hulk-haters, and wannabe-scientists impair your judgment of this excellent film.

616,Icarus_geo,Sets a new record in the stupid cinema,2,26 May 2005,"Well, I'm sure this ""movie""(?) has already been the target of many hate and flame, to the point of being used as an icon of comparison when discussing other movies, as in ""almost as bad as the hulk"", or when trying to insult the doubtful qualities of a critic saying ""you're surely the kind that thinks the hulk was a good movie"".I agree with all that, but it makes me think why also the mediocre mass of ignorance hunger that pays to see this film and its kind, flames it as if they'd want to revindicate the fact that they're not as stupid as the box office proves. Well, I suppose it's the same people that affirm to hate Bush, just because they think it's cool to hate him (but still voting for that donkey).It pains me to see that Ang Lee ""directed"" this, coming for ""Tiger & Dragon"" must have been certainly a killing downhill.I hope there's still hope for Lee, at least.",Hulk
617,donie1798,should be played to insomniac patients,1,3 December 2005,"I've only ever fallen asleep in the Cinema once. It was during this film. Evidently, I didn't miss much of the film, a fact that was much to my annoyance at the time. As the credits began to roll, a friend stood up and boo-ed. I then tried to explain the legal arguments for and against asking for his money back, and how is time would be better spent using alcohol to remove any memory of the film whatsoever. Never before has a film attempted to bore the viewer into submission in the first 45 minutes with made up science. Then came the Hulk.A series of ""arty"" scenes of how in-fact the ""hulking process"" actually happens weren't so much informative, but rather needlessly complex, as if the audience would feel cheated by seeing uber-human feats being performed by the Hulk, if they couldn't themselves understand the ""morphing"" that takes place.",Hulk
618,lizness,Should have been more emotional,6,28 October 2005,"I wish I could give this film a higher rating.When I was little I loved the Hulk, watching every episode without fail. I was a bit of a tomboy, but not so much that I read superhero comics, and I probably wasn't even aware of the Hulk's origins. And now I love comic book films. Sin City blew me away, both Spiderman films have thoroughly entertained me, and Batman Begins is just fantastic. So when they made the Hulk with Eric Bana, probably my favourite actor since seeing Chopper years ago, I thought I was on to a winner.At the end of every episode of the Hulk I cried my eyes out. Dr Banner's life was so tragic, it was a bit like a more intelligent 'Littlest Hobo' (LOL). Every week you would hope that he could start over again and have a normal life, but by the end he would have to move on, and it broke my heart every time.So the film should have at least made me feel some emotion, even just a little choked up! If they do make a sequel that's the one thing they need to concentrate on, making everyone weep like little girls by then end.",Hulk
619,ramificating,"Terrific film, bad advertising",10,19 January 2006,"When I read the reviews for this film all I heard were criticism which made me skip it when it was in theaters but when i rented this film I realized what idiots some of the critics were for calling this film crap or awful or what ever word they used to insult it. Because of their reviews not very many people went to see it which made it very unpopular. If your reading this i urge you to rent this film and make up your own opinion of the film. I thought this film was fantastic they really explain the hulk very well in this film and the way it's shown on the screen, with different scenes that are happening at the same time displayed at once made it look a bit like a digital comic book which i enjoyed about the film even though you may focus on one of the shots and miss the others. This isn't as good as x-men or spider-man but you shouldn't really compare because its completely different in its own way. If you love the hulk comics or your just love action films then see this film without listening to any one else and you will see that its in fact very good, very well made film by Ang Lee and terrific acting by Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly and many others.",Hulk
620,Kitrich,Maybe I just didnt get it,5,20 June 2003,"The Hulk is a slickly packaged comic book movie that will do decent buisness, but ultimatly fail to garner what Spider-Man and X-Men have done.Eric Bana as the title character seems awfully reserved until he gets blasted by gamma radiation.  His character turns into what best could be described as a pervert.  Everything from his facial expressions to his demeanor is perverted. The movie attempts to tackle hard hitting science themes, but winds up as another King Kong rip off.  Seriously, watch it and think to yourself, this is what happens when King Kong gets it on with a soy bean. Ang Lee tries to keep the film from collapsing on itself, due to a very weak story, with a comic book presentation of split screens.  This is very well done, yet distracting from the final presentation. Overall the movie fails to live up to what it could have been, especially with the disasterous ending sequence that will have um rolling in the aisles. 2 stars out of 5 j.pauley",Hulk
621,leonardogyn,Impossible to be worst !!!,2,30 June 2003,"The last 'super heroes' that were made dissapointed me a little. Spider Man was OK, it wasn't perfect but it was fine. Daredevil was bad, VERY bad.I must confess I wasn't expecting too much from Hulk. My fears were confirmed.

622,HurricaneDexter,Requiem for a Dream meets Comic Books.,1,21 June 2003,"What was Ang Lee thinking?  This movie was the slowest moving movie that I have EVER seen.  The first hour of this movie was nothing but boring background story with stupid cut scenes.  The scenes were supposed to make it look like a comic book but all they did was annoy everyone.  Every other scene contained a microscope close up (similiar to the drug scenes in Requiem).  Then there were about 100 dream sequences.  There was even a dream sequence INSIDE a dream sequence (when he is dreaming while looking at the photograph).  If this movie was anything but a Comic book or Comedy, Ang Lee would have directed a masterpiece.  But there was too much unneeded stuff going on.  The fight scenes were barely legible.  You can't tell anything that is going on in the fight scenes except for at the end when the Hulk jumps out victorious.  They were boring at best.  The one thing that I enjoyed about this movie was Nick Nolte.  His roll was pathetically written but luckily it was acted well enough to get by.",Hulk

They did a nice job with the special effects, and the scenes in the desert were cool.  This movie seems a little long/drawn out for a Marvel movie, so I didn't like it as much as Spider-man or X-men, but still a decent movie.  Worth seeing in the theaters. 7/10.",Hulk
624,CSe7en,Very very poor.,4,23 June 2003,"Watching these movie I decided that there is an ever increasinging gap between a film and a comic-book film. The comic-book film is a new medium. To truly understand it, you must be up on thousands of comics, animated cartoons and lots more trivia. You are really playing catch-up if your just an average film fan.Ok so the Hulk, what can I say what a waste of acting ability and the over-hyped Ang Lee over-hypes his career again. The CGI was poor, it would have been realistic if they would have painted Arnold Schwarznegger green. The split-screen, this only works on 24, but Ang Lee uses it to confuse the audience and to show young directors how not to make a film, ever heard of the 180 degree rule.Eric Bana brilliant in Black Hawk Down is wasted here, Nicke Nolte is prepared to grunt his way through the movie and the one characters played by Josh Lucas is so one dimensional he could fit underneath the gap at the bottom of doors.Does Ang Lee specify in boring his audience, first 45 minutes of Crouching Tiger the whole of Ride With The Devil? This is a very poor film, but while there are geeks out their who will see this film 20 times, we better prepare for the sequels. But I don't care I won't be watching them.",Hulk
625,ToReignInHell,What a waste of time...,1,25 June 2003,"I didn't have high expectations for this movie.  As a regular movie-go-er, I usually like most movies I watch.  Granted, I see enough that more than a handful aren't decent, and I've had some arguments with friends about how good movies were (yes, I like b-movies, so sue me.)  With this said, I approached the Hulk expecting a fun, interesting movie, not necessarily good, but at least entertaining, within the realm of the rest of the super-hero movies that have come out lately, with much success.Boy was I wrong.  This was the first movie in a long while that bored me, and the first movie I can remember that actually made me want my money back. I thought the CGI would be the worst thing about this movie, but it was the best, and it wasn't all that great.  Oh, I'm wrong... Sam Elliot was good, it was nice to see him in a ""block-buster"" picture, and Jennifer Connelly put in a good performance, but the rest of the movie was crap.  How they got once superb actor Nick Nolte to play such an awful part is beyond me.  The editing was atrocious, among the worst I've ever seen.  The editor couldn't figure out how he wanted to get from one scene to the next.  Wipes, dissolves, cuts were all used, and for a while it was more entertaining to count the number of different methods used than to actually watch the movie. But only for so long, because after a while you can't remember if you were on #63 or #72.  The soundtrack was bland, not even coming close to the excellence achieved in Daredevil.Don't bother wasting your time with this movie.  If you must see it, wait till it's out on video, and see if you can con a friend into renting it, so you don't have to waste your money on it.",Hulk

627,RyanittoTD,Me angry...Me VERY angry....AT MOVIE!!! ARRRGH!!!,1,22 June 2003,"Let me begin by I was hoping The Hulk would be a very cool movie about holding up your rage and just letting it out because the whole world is becoming a very hard place.Um, I guess when your expectations are turned differently it can be a good thing, but honestly... What the heck happened with this movie?!?***Spoiler-time: Read if you seen, read if you want to be warned and convinced to save yourself 5-10 dollars...free of charge!***But I was confused of what Bruce was so angry about... When he first turned into Hulk, he was really angered by a dog about to bite him.... ABOUT to bite him. Now I'm no hot-head, but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't get p***ed off and go rampaging across the city.Anyway, enough about talking about the story (wait, there was a story!?)I know this isn't just me, my friend right next to me fell asleep off and on in the movie, he woke up when the action sequences came in and fell asleep right after they ended. I ALSO notice this movie doesn't use music very well at all... Maybe a total of 6 orchestrated songs for the movie?The CGI however, I will say that they did a pretty good job with making the guy look like Bruce... But does no one realize that they went a little HEAVY on the transitions!? I read an article and they said they used about every single transition style that is possible in one movie. I hope everyone understands the concepts of why transitions are used... most are to show a time difference, but these were used almost in every cut! Sure they must have planned it well, but who cares about transitions when you can't understand what's going on in the movie in the first place?And about the debatable ""comic book look"" to the movie. The multi-camera angle thing CAN be seen as a more free way of expressing the movie, because after all you get to see everything in a different way. But why would anyone pay 8 dollars to go see a movie that LOOKS like a comic book? The guy dying in the explosion was just a terrible way of making a guy die... A white outline of him and fading into the explosion, then zoom out.My opinion on the multi-camera angle concept, it IS a new way of showing a movie... no doubt... But it totally ruins the concept of a ""drama"" feel when you're trying to make something serious... because why on Earth do we want to see 3 people's emotions when we can't even understand ONE person's emotions? (besides HULK MAD! HULK SMASH!)The plot took a very long time to get up to pace, about 40 minutes into the movie we finally see The Hulk come into action... Whereas X-Men took a solid what, 10 minutes tops? Spider-man took about 20 minutes, but at least we are shown a love interest development and comedy relief, which does tend to flow better than confusing drama for 40 minutes...As for the villain...Um, where is he?! Oh the father? Didn't know, but why did it take so long for him to show up with the Hulk?Honestly, the time length of the movie.. Can be SERIOUSLY dropped down another HOUR.I'm sure ANYONE can come up with something better to fight, I mean... dogs?! All right...t...that's nice...And can someone please tell me... WHY the movie didn't explain why he turned green when he got angry... No, they explain how he GOT that power... But why on Earth does he turn into a massive creature? Are we just supposed to assume he turns into a big thing or what?! You understand why Spider-Man can shoot webbing because he was bit by a spider, that's what spiders do... But what kind of creature turns into a big green muscle monster?!?!??Oh wait that's right, the movie didn't say... Heh, there's a lot of missing elements aren't there? I haven't seen many movies with plotholes like... in a very long time (The Musketeer movie) but this one just tops that movie right off and certainly brings blockbuster movie making to a whole new level... A level covered with confusion, disappointment and utter ANGER at the movie.Hulk: -1/10(P.S. - To the producers of Hulk, never make a movie again)",Hulk
628,prplmnky-1,An awful waste of a great hero,1,4 November 2006,"This movie left so much to be desired as to make me feel physically ill while watching. That is not even an exaggeration, the camera work and scene changes were so mind bending it made me feel motion sick sitting in my theater seat. While Jennifer Connelly and the rest are great actors, this film was a mockery of both their talents and the essence of The Hulk. The convoluted and downright erroneous back story was just the beginning of the missteps taken in this movie. One of my biggest peeves was the egregious use of CG to construct the Hulk into an irritating lightbright. While the Hulk should be larger than life, he shouldn't also be brighter than the sun, I couldn't even take his interaction with the other characters seriously. And the idea of constant metamorphosis was laughable, to have him be larger than a tank in one scene and then eye to eye with Betty in another? Please. While Lee may have been trying to construct a master peace out of the walking demolition machine of Marvel I believe he far overshot his goal. In the end, I demanded my money back, and the hours from my life.",Hulk
629,Elwood-2,You Won't Like Me When I'm Angry,1,25 November 2003,"Therefore you will not like me after watching this film.
Ang Lee's apparent goal for this project was not to make a dull, drawn-out, overwrought mess of a film, but to do so in a random nonsensical and quite frankly ridiculous fashion.A cure for insomnia, for certain, Hulk, the movie, had as many distractions from the ill-fated story line as it had poor visuals. The first 35 minutes of the film go nowhere slowly, then the rest is just a painful combination of a bad story and worse computer-generated animation.Slowly tapping a spike into your forehead will undoubtedly be a preferred way to spend an evening.The inner beast was released -- and sadly made it onto film and DVD.",Hulk
630,mike-492,Strange intepretation of a simple concept,7,6 November 2003,"After seeing this last night on DVD after having viewed it opening night in the theatres, I can safely say that HULK is a big, misguided, meandering mess of a film.  I think Ang Lee's intentions were definitely noble and honest, but I feel the mistake is made when he applies the complex editing techniques used throughout the film to the script.  The concept of the Hulk is simple---The Hulk is the physical manifestation of an introverted person's subdued rage.  That's it. The problem?  For one, this movie explains too much, too soon.  Do we really need to start chronologically, examining the past of Bruce Banner and moving forward to see where he ended up?  I don't think so.  How about we start with this weird introverted person, and as HE picks apart the clues to this life, these questions and answers are then exposed to US, the audience, while the auxilary characters in the film are trying to understand what made this man become green and angry?  It's really that simple. The big memory he is supressing is not only that much of a mystery, it's actually quite lame!  *SPOILER* David Banner accidentally kills the mother!  It's an accident! Why are you so upset, Bruce?  The comics treated David Banner much simpler---he was simply a paranoid workaholic abusive father, who felt that his work at a radiation plant may have had adverse effect on his genes, which would maybe manifest in Bruce. When his wife has a difficult pregnancy, he thinks its because the baby is a freak.  You see?  It's not about a man injecting his son with chemicals, and its not about accidental murders...this is a simple story about a dysfunctional person and how his childhood has effected him.  Making David Banner into a super villain was a pointless mistake---how about just making Talbot into The Abomination and have those two duke it out?Anwyay.  I could go on and on about the plot, but there is no point, the movie has been made, and the majority of people think it missed the mark.  I can't honestly recommend anyone seeing this film, unless you happen upon it at Virgin Megastore or you talk a friend into renting it.",Hulk
631,tedgyz,Booooorrrriiiinnnnngggggg!!!,3,3 January 2004,"Despite the generally negative reviews I had heard from friends, I rented this DVD with an open mind.  I truly wanted to like the movie.  I never read the comic book, so I didn't have a chip on my shoulder.The plot was painfully slow.  There is a continual feeble attempt to make you feel for Bruce Banner and his trauma, but in the end it is just annoying.  There is far too much time wasted trying to explain why he is The Hulk and not enough actual Hulk.  I didn't find the special effects as bad as most people have stated.  I just feel that a movie about The Hulk should have more of him, instead of the tortuous wait to see him appear.{Minor Spoilers ahead) While I usually like Nick Nolte, I thought his character (Bruce Banner's father) was horrible - probably attributed to a bad script. This is painfully evident in the ""climatic"" end when he meets with his son.  His philisophical ramblings are a jumbled mess leaving you dazed and confused. He then morphs into some crazed lunatic monster and the whole movie falls off the precipitous edge of believability.  After all, the whole point of super-hero stories is to create unbelievable characters within a believable story.Sam Eliot also comes off weak in this movie.  It feels like he is holding back, like he is fighting off some demon.  Perhaps he is internally wracked by regrets at agreeing to the script.  The whole sequence where he goes after The Hulk are silly.  He has to call the President just to justify fielding a few Apache helicopters?  C'mon!  You keep waiting for them to pull out the really big stuff, but it never happens.  Again, the believability just isn't there.  The jet fighter scenes just don't seem real.I give this movie 3/10.  It is as flat was week-old ginger-ale.",Hulk
632,carmackdaddy,The bravest movie of the year (thus far),8,3 July 2003,"Ang Lee's ""The Hulk"" is the bravest movie I've seen this year, if only in concept. It's the world's first character-driven, art-house inspired comic book adaptation that cares more about the psychological complexities of its characters than it does on its slam-bang special FX. Logical questions immediately pop up, such as ""Do we really need a SERIOUS comic book film?"" Well, probably not, but still, the idea is intriguing, and leave it to Ang Lee to make it somehow work. ""The Hulk"" is the ""Natural Born Killers"" of superhero movies; some absolutely love it, others dispise every bit of it. I'm in the limited crowd of its admirers; I thought it was brilliant in almost every way, from the acting, writing, directing, and musical standpoints (Danny Elfman's score is utterly incredibly). The movie reminded me much of last year's ""Minority Report"" in the way it sort of looks like a popcorn action movie but sort of rises above it; sort of a perfection. ""The Hulk"" is not the greatest comic book ever made (""X2"" deserves that honor) but it is a maginificent film experience. You'll never see anything like it. Although Eric Bana plays Bruce Banner, the poor soul cursed with an inner green monster, the real star of the movie is Lee's inventive direction, which involves everything from ultra-cool split screen ""panels"" to bizarre, head-scratching close-ups on fungi. Lee is obviously having a wild time directing his little ""big"" movie, and brings the same sort of thoughtfulness and power that he brought to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" While ""Hulk"" is not where near as amazing as that film, it is quite a movie. Nick Nolte has to be seen to believed as the crazed father and the special FX range from amazing (the evil killer Hulk dogs) to mediocre (the Hulk jumping). Despite an awkward, out-of-place final scene that cries out for an ineviatable sequel, ""Hulk"" proves to be a successful non-conventional attempt at a conventional subject matter. Overall, I recommend this movie just for you to argue about it with someone. **** out of ****",Hulk

The only people that may not like this one will be those who demand an exact recreation from the comic.  The Hulk is similar to previous comic book adaptations (such as Spiderman, DareDevil and X-Men) which means that they are all don't follow exactly to the comic books, but are close.  The Hulk does differ from the previous comic book adaptations with the camera shots and camera views, making the movie simialar to a comic book.  Some scenes have 4 different camera angles all showing at the same time, or an additional camera angles that pan across the main view.

639,Denpon,Superb!!! One of my favorites of 2003,9,17 June 2003,"I saw this movie in a sneak preview, so I was lucky enough to be able to tell my friends about the caliber of this movie. This movie was actually incredibly good, and I'm completely serious in that. The plot was excellent, Jennifer Connelly was once again amazing as Betty Ross, the part of Bruce Banner excellently portrayed by Eric Bana, and the sadistic and maniacally evil father was played to the T by Nick Nolte. When I saw the trailers, I thought this movie was going to be incredibly bad, and from other posts, people agreed. However, as they say ""you can't judge a book by its cover"". When I first heard about the changes in plot as compared to the comic book, I was distraught, as I am a huge fan of the Hulk comic. However, the underlying complexities, the egotistic and insane ideas of the father, and the Beast within us all gave an extraordinary depth to this movie. The final scene shows a battle between good and evil, a fight used far too often, but in this case it works. Probably most pleasing as a comic book fan was the directing and cinematography of Ang Lee. Many scenes, including *spoiler* when Hulk is escaping from the Army Base and reflects a rocket propelled grenade*, transfer using comic book panelling, and this was used very well. All in all, I would recommend this movie to anyone, including comic book lovers and haters alike. This movie is beyond that spectrum, and I hope everyone will enjoy it.",Hulk
640,TheKarateSpider,Made Me Angry,4,17 October 2010,"Every now and then, maybe once in a cinematic generation, a film comes along directed by someone who is considered beyond the source material he is working with, OR someone who is the polar opposite of the genre of the movie. This nearly always causes a buzz from fans and the entertainment industry prior to the movies release then slating from film critics upon its release. Good examples of this would be David Lynch's Dune (1984) and Sir Ridley Scott's Robin Hood (2010). It is very true of Ang Lee's Hulk as well. For various different reasons the movie simply fails to deliver a movie that audiences across the board enjoyed, and it is fair to say this is because Ang Lee gets it wrong on many levels. The Incredible Hulk is my favourite superhero and comic book title, i was weaned on the 1982 Animated Series and the excellent, classic Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno starring live action TV series. As a comic book reader i cut my teeth with Peter David's Hulk titles. Ang Lee fails to deliver a movie that has any of the enjoying factors of any of the above, he gives us a clunky, clattering and clumsy over long look at the world of Bruce Banner and The Hulk. The pace never picks up and the characters and their worlds are boring. Part of the problem is with the casting of Eric Bana as Bruce Banner, Lee makes the character such an alien and unaproachable freak that it is hard for anyone watching to relate to him or identify with the character. Lee undoubtedly got it wrong but Banas performance also lacks the charisma and qualities of say Christopher Reeve as Superman, the freakish nature of Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne/Batman or the every man qualities of Bill Bixby's David Banner, all of these performances prove what is capable in genre acting so there can be no excuses. The tone of the supporting cast performances are uneven to say the least, Josh Lucas is put in a horrible situation not knowing whether to perform Talbot as over the top sneering villain or pantomime camp. Nick Nolte is miscast as Banners father and delivers a truly odd performance that gives the impression he just wondered in undressed, under groomed after a night on cocaine from the actors studio. The biggest problem though lies fairly and squarely with the unconvincing and poorly realised special effects, none of which look convincing and look like proto types, and this is a huge problem : The character of The Hulk himself is a CGI realised effect that went badly BADLY wrong, not only is the design of Hulk poor (he looks like Shrek's angry steroid pumped uncle!), it leaves the film with a sense of anti climax following his first appearances and subsequent metamorphis. Also it is impossible to relate and identify with a CGI monstrosity such as this when it goes right,when it goes wrong it is even more so and you just don't believe in The Hulk here in the same way as you would do with a credible acting performance or the way you did do with Lou Ferrigno. Praise must be given for at least attempting to produce something bold but the finished result has nothing commendable. Hulk never manages to echo the greatness of the comics and subsequent versions of the character, Bana doesn't come any where near to matching the magic of Bill Bixby, and Ang Lee's movie, with its slow pace, lumbersome heavy handedness and over seriousness fails in a big way to offer up an entertaining piece of cinema.",Hulk
641,disgracian,I actually liked this movie,7,26 June 2003,"The time spent on Bruce Banner's background probably shouldn't have been left in the final cut. It just took time away from mayhem.If I had have directed that movie, it would have started with the Hulk just walking down a street, kicking cars over buildings and throwing mimes into the stratasphere. Then the tanks come along, so he can throw them and bash them to death with other tank bits, then he could have gone on to wipe out villages and then all sorts of strange and cool things would attack him, and he'd destroy them all easily.",Hulk
642,bryedtan_02,A thinking man's comic book movie,8,27 June 2003,"Ang Lee's new motion picture the Hulk is a brilliant mix of CGI action and psychological drama on the relationship of father and son. The sequence of the movie makes you feel like you were literally seeing things in the perspective of a comic book reader. The CGI effects of our giant green friend may seem hokey to some but in it all they are mind blowing. The true greatness lies in James Schamus' terrific screenplay which mixes comic book imagination, sins of the father, and fear of what man can't control into one movie. I have heard some people complain that the film was over dramatic and too dizzying. I have to say to them is first of all this is a comic book movie more in line with the likes of Road to Perdition than Batman and before they watch they need to have more of the sensibilities of comic book fans. This is one of the best comic book adaptation movies I have seen since From Hell. The conflict of Bruce Banner and his father reminds me of the earlier works of Ang Lee in his Father knows best movies.Which proves the Ang Lee is one of the best directors I have seen in years.",Hulk
643,aashish,Big green storm cloud,5,20 June 2003,"Good and bad.The Hulk sure delivered what it promised. So if you're ready for another big budget, badly written, comic book adaptation... you'll love it. However, as a true fan of the cartoon... I must say that the movie's story itself was a huge disappointment.Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, and Nick Nolte all gave stunning performances, and the CGI was incredible.A 6/10 I'd say. If this movie was compressed and made much shorter at its beginning and its end... it's probably deserve an 8/10. However, the tedious story and terrible dialogue make it a real pain to sit through however. The only thing that'll save this one is the action sequences.",Hulk
644,thesar30-1-977531,"Puny Humans, Indeed",5,14 March 2011,"I grew up on the Hulk. Let me start over – I grew up on TV's (Bill Bixby's) The Incredible Hulk. Oh, that and Wonder Woman (on TV that is – Superman was my movie hero) were it for me. Glued were my eyes whenever those two superheroes were on the small screen.That said, I had an open mind about the first (of two. Three?) Hulk outing on the big screen knowing that they'd probably revert back to the true legend of the Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde comic book character. Personally, I wanted the big-screen version of the TV show where no one knew who David (not Bruce) was and he was always on the run. But that wasn't in the cards.After watching Ang Lee's 2003's art-house take I had mixed feelings. I knew I wanted to like it more since it was one of my childhood favorites. I even watched it multiple more times in theatres and at home, because that's all I had for a ""new"" Hulk vs. all the TV reruns. I'm guessing people might have done the same when Star Trek: The Motion Picture was it for trekkers before The Wrath of Kahn came to pass.To this day, eight years after release plus one reboot, I'm still divided. Much like Jar Jar, I hated the father story then, and still do. There's other problems with the movie, but the number one is the complete father story. Eliminate that and it would've been oodles better. Notice: not replace, for it was far too long anyways.Adding in more Hulk burst-outs, heck – have at least one during the first 40 or so minutes and stop that annoying split screen/comic book look could have also aided in the movie's recovery. But these are here nor there, what's done was done.The positives were the casting – Eric Bana was great as Bruce Banner, Jennifer Connelly wonderful as Betty Ross and most of all, Sam Elliott was excellent as her father, General Ross. Also, despite the all-but neon green hulk, he did look real on the screen, for the most part. In addition, whenever he attempted lifting or smashing, it looked pretty real to what in my mind would happen. Case in point: when he tries to first lift/break the ""gamma"" emitting sphere and he hadn't counted on it being too heavy. And, with the tanks – with/without his strength, he would have some problems pulling them apart. These are just two examples of what they got right.Ang Lee admitted prior that he was not a fan and further, never picked up a Hulk comic book. He just wanted to make it from his mind. Sad. I'm not going to produce and star in a Shakespeare play without ever reading it. That's ignorance.And his showed. He tried far too many artsy ideas that normally work in his movies, but not in a COMIC BOOK MOVIE. He got so caught up with making it swank he forgot his (MINE) fan base. Unless it's a comedy, I don't want to see Pride & Prejudice & Predators.In one of the best scenes, the Hulk is tearing up an underground government lair and at the most inopportune time, Lee reduces visibility with his multiple comic book panels. I was p*ssed and didn't want to pay any attention to what Lee wanted me to see on the screen other than the one that showed the Hulk smashing and prancing about. Lee also went further by switching back and forth between the styles: real time and his cartoonish freeze-frames and ""Batman POW!"" shots. It was as if he, himself, had little faith in what he was doing.It's not a basic plot – another problem for a COMIC BOOK MOVIE – but here's the quick synopsis: Daddy Banner (I refuse to call him what they named him, let's just say he was played horribly by Nick Nolte) was involved in mysterious experiments and after injecting himself against orders by General Ross, he inadvertently fathers a child who, of course, grows up and out as Bruce Banner.Daddy's locked away, while now-grown Bruce does similar experiments and blunders which triggers a jolly green ""angry man"" (their name for it, bleahh.) Everyone knows it's Bruce and everyone wants a piece of the green to make, well, more green.From there, it gets pretty over-complicated – again mainly from the Daddy-Issues. Suffice to say, Hulk will make just a few more appearances, some a little too big and even making it into San Francisco.Let me stop there. Much like The Lost World: Jurassic Park, how disappointing was it when you have a real-looking giant (sorry, Godzilla) enter a city for just a few minutes? But, even with the few precious moments we had him in a city setting, the movie absolutely should've ended right there becauseIn one of the worst endings in comic book movie history (or just about any film) come following. I do spill out spoilers in my reviews, but I won't ruin the ending for anybody curious. Suffice to say, one word: RIDICULOUS.Thank God, they did give Hulk another shot five years later – though not much better, but it was a bastard Hulk, thankfully. That's another story. As for 2003's Hulk, eh, give it as least one viewing. As bad as some of the film was, it could've been a lot worse.",Hulk
645,daddyrifle,Give it a chance!,8,7 August 2003,"The average rating looks low but give it a chance. I thought it was pretty good and deserves at least a 7.5 rating. He did look suspect a few times but overall the story, CGI and acting were good, especially Jennifer Connelly.",Hulk
646,franseca,Better than I expected.,8,28 November 2003,"I must say, it was better than I expected it would be. The special effects were wonderful, and as far as I could tell it was a pretty accurate portrayal of his abilities. If you haven't seen it, let me give you fair warning that they do take some liberties with the storyline -- but what they came up with was nonetheless plausible. I especially liked that it didn't get boring -- it was fast-paced, and they did an interesing comic-book styling as far as scene switching and framework. All in all, quality entertainment. :-D",Hulk

A very entertaining comic book film and not disappointing, for me at least.",Hulk
648,ry-bier,Could have been so much better,5,26 June 2012,"I watched this movie with sorta high expectations, even though most people hate it. It starts out boring and slow, and I thought it would get better, but it doesn't. That is what makes it a bad movie. An example of this is that you don't see the hulk until about 40 minutes into the movie, and when you do, it's not very exciting. Another reason this movie is bad is that it's plot is thin. It hardly has any story, except the origin of the hulk and Bruce Banner's parents. That is what makes this movie hard to sit through. When I was watching this movie, I didn't like it until the end, but when it got to the climax, I hated it. This movie's climax is just plain weird. The Hulk's dad turns into this electric monster then blows up. Now onto the special effects. Now I understand that in 2003 when this movie was made, special effects were not as complex and advanced as they are now. With that information, you should know that the hulk's appearance in this movie was as good as it could be. It wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible either. So overall this movie suffers from a very weak plot, not to mention bad acting. It's only strong point was it's special effects. Do not see this movie.OVERALL 4.8/10",Hulk
649,mostlygreek,It ain't for kids!,8,25 October 2004,"Hulk is a great film made by a great director. But Hulk has two huge problems. Firstly, its audience. And secondly, its release date. Hulk is a very insightful film about the true nature of heroism and also of identity. Its rare to see a film about a super hero that actually deals with one of the most important aspects of heroism- the fact that most super heroes would rather not have the power(s) they possess. Of course the incredible Hulk is not a typical spandex- wearing hero, and in this movie version we see Eric Bana's character struggle with his new identity. However, audiences that have been used to watching such releases as x men, spiderman, and even daredevil, are not tuned to Ang Lee's vision of Hulk. Quite the opposite is true. So the fact that Hulk tries to flesh out its characters and provide enough emotional weight to its scenes is completely irrelevant to a young and action-thirsty audience.The special fx are awesome. The integration of cg and live action is great, and the hulk himself looks amazing when bullets are rippling on his skin and when he is bounding from place to place. Sam Elliot plays Betty's father and gives a convincing performance as a general forced to protect his country and his daughter. Jennifer Connelly is perfect as Betty and even Bana manages to stay believable at some of the most unbelievable moments. Its just a shame that Hulk was released at a time when super hero movies are two a penny. Is Ang Lee the only film maker who realises that real comic book fans aren't kids anymore? Has Hulks box office takings doomed us to flimsy scripts and trailer-worthy visuals? Lets hope not, because i don't think i could sit through anymore spiderman films.So the next time you hear someone telling you how bored they were during Hulk, tell them to go watch Xmen 2...then go watch Hulk with dts- a real hero film with a great story, terrific cast, and beautiful visuals(even when things aren't being blown up!) It ain't for kids!",Hulk

651,alexosborne80,"Some great action, its a shame about the story.",6,11 July 2006,"Hulk was one of my favourite comic book hero's, he is great so my expectations for this film were a little high. Now I am going to hate myself for doing this but.......the film needed to be dumbed down a bit.The story although OK got a bit confusing and there was no real explanation for the things that were happening. That combined with the fact that when they did explain things you still didn't understand because Nick Nolty mumbled his way though his line during the whole film. Also the big fight at the end of the movie just leaves you scratching your head going HUH??? The basics of the story is not the HULK, so hulk fans beware.The action was 100% Fantastic it almost felt lifted straight from the comic, Its fast paced and epic. However there is not enough of it, so you get bored allot sitting through a story that just drags. As soon as the Hulk is on screen though wake up. Hulk fans this is HULK action, straight from the comics. Some of my friends thought it was silly when he jumps a few miles, but hey he does that in the comic all the time.The effects are also fantastic, there are a few questionable scenes where they look a little dodgy but the Hulk who is 100%CG looks pretty cool throughout the movie.The acting is also superb and i would give them all an A+ with the exception of Nick Nolty who in my opinion was one of the reasons the film was not as good as it could've been.It is a shame really that a film with Great acting and Great action, is let down by a story that over complicates quite a basic concept....oh and Nick Nolty.So HULK fans beware this film takes some liberties with the story but check out the action. People with Kids have the remote ready to fast forward to the action. For non comic book fans, stay away.",Hulk
652,unforgivenmaster737,A truly unique experience.,9,5 July 2005,"No, seriously.""The Hulk"" is not only an immensely underrated gem, it swells with originality not seen in any other comic book film at the time..No, this is the first true comic book turned film. Forget the X-Men, hell, even Spider-Man. Ang Lee's vision not only makes this film unforgettable, he's able to do the unthinkable: he makes you feel like you're reading an interactive comic book.Ang Lee's viscerally razor sharp editing and multi screen camera effects are still not to be matched. It not only makes ""The Hulk"" very unique, it's this characteristic that makes the film as good as it is.Anyways, the film is about how Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk, as a combined result of his father David's (Nick Nolte) self induced experiments and gamma rays. The gamma rays awaken what was a part of Bruce his entire life, and they trigger whenever he has a momentary lapse of rage, usually when he has a nightmare. This is of course, after he discovers that not only is his father not dead, but he's been hired as the new janitor of the lab he works at. He was locked in prison for 30 years because of the experiments he performed on himself, and now he's back to doing the same old thing. Jennifer Connelly plays Betty Ross, Bruce's one time love interest and lab partner. She's good in the role, but one can only imagine what it wouldn't been like had they used her more. Sam Elliot turns out a very memorable performance as her father, the very same person who locked Bruce's father away. His sole duty in this movie is to be a hard ass, non-likable guy, who's sole purpose in life is to destroy the Hulk, and with that he does a very good job. Nick Nolte in my life has never done a bad acting job, and he really shines in this role, even if he does look like he needs a bath most of the time.All in all, a very well written, acted, edited and directed movie. It simply does not deserve the bad reviews it's received.",Hulk

Yes the CGI is dodge, and the comic screen sharing is not too everyone's taste, but the actual story is great and so much better than the intro of Abomination. It's a well pieced together movie and thoroughly entertaining, with great performances from Bana and Connelly. I mean Bana is really good at acting angry, freak, it must have been a little unnerving filming him at times. So much better than Norton, (though he's an amazing actor, but he's not a patch on Bana in this role). This has to be a cult classic, while Norton's Hulk will be quickly forgotten. Great comic style, great acting, great story, great music, best intro to the Hulk.",Hulk
654,IrishVisionary,Delves deep into characters and story. Although the effects are dated.,7,30 April 2016,"One of my favourite Marvel films, I do like the casting of the characters, especially of Nick Nolte as David Banner. I love the storyline, I love the more than black/white character development in many of the characters, again, with David Banner. The effects for the Hulk seem to have dated quite a bit, although much of the rest of the effects seem to hold well. I do feel there was a little too much talking in some places, but I thoroughly enjoyed the story over the action, and if comparing this one with the 2008 version, I'd probably choose this one, due to better acting and story.

657,Ogar1,The Hulk falls flat,4,20 June 2003,"After walking out of the theater showing Ang Lee's Hulk, I asked myself two questions: `Why in the world did I spend some hard-earned money on a ticket to see it?' and  `What were they thinking?' The writing for this movie is just awful.  It seemed as though the first hour would never end as we learn of Bruce Banner's tragic past.  I heard people groaning in the crowd as Eric Bana's Bruce Banner and Jennifer Connally's Betty Ross kept talking and talking and talking.  I was under the impression that this was an action movie, yet most of the first half is dedicated to the action of people running their mouths.  Worse yet, the characters overstate the obvious!  They repeat situations out loud that we've already seen on the screen.  Forget more careful editing they should have thrown out most of this movie! The audience waited for Banner to undergo his blast of gamma radiation and change into the Hulk.  They waited and waited and when it finally happened, the Hulk appears onscreen for a few moments, throws a few things around, then smashes through a wall and runs away.  Wow.  We waited that long to see this?  Later, when the Hulk goes on a smashing spree, the things they chose to do leave you wanting more.  But great, memorable scenes just don't happen here. Even the great Sam Elliot's performance as General Ross couldn't save this movie from the horrible overacting of Nick Nolte and the dull performance of Bana.  Even the action scenes were poorly done in spots.  As the Hulk is fleeing from the military, this horrible slow music is playing in the background with whistles and whatnot.  Ang Lee, this may have worked for Crouching Tiger, but it is horribly misplaced here.  Lee also elected to show parts of the movie in panels, seventies-style.  My guess is that he wanted to show it like a comic book with panels.  Instead, it just annoyed me. The creature is impressive; it is just not used enough.  They must have had only so much dough to spend on the computer-generated Hulk and the enormous marketing campaign (Hulk Cereal, anyone?) that they skimped on screenwriting and had to fill in time with useless babble. Stay away if you're looking for a good action movie, or even a decent superhero movie.  Go rent Superman or Spider-Man or whatever.  I'm kind of wishing I'd gone to see Hollywood Homicide, and I heard that sucks!  In fact, From Justin to Kelly probably has more action.  Oh well.",Hulk
658,mafv,"Slow and boring with terrible direction, writing and acting.",1,23 June 2003,"One point (pointless is closer to the truth). The simple origin story in the comic book is replaced by a long and very dull family psycho-drama dating back 30 years. It's a good 40 minutes (actually it is a very bad 40 minutes)  before we get to see The Hulk, and even then the action scenes are no fun at all. The standard of the dialog in this movie is very low. It plays like Ang Lee wrote the script in Chinese and then got Google to translate it into English. The direction is appalling. Ang makes heavy handed use of split screen in an overly literal attempt toevoke the feeling of comic book panels. What Ang should instead havepreserved was the fast pace and simplistic story lines of the original. This film desperately needs comic relief - lots of it. It takes itself so seriously you'd think this was Schindler's List, not an attempt at a Summer action movie.",Hulk
659,DigitalM,Ang Lee raped my childhood,2,18 January 2004,"I waited until this movie arrived on DVD to watch it.  The trailers made me feel as though this was a well-acted movie with terrible CG at the centerpiece.  Boy, was I wrong.  Everything about this polished turd of a film was awful.  Great actors deliver canned lines from a script that is the clear product of groupthink.  This film has postitively none of the emotional resonance that it should have ... or so desperately tries to attain.Ang Lee has proven that he is not blockbuster material.  The beauty of his body of work is sold short by his overuse of split screen (the TV show ""24"" knows how to use this device correctly) and jerky editing.  Nevermore has one pined for a Kubrick movie (even one as mediocre as ""Eyes Wide Shut"") just to have a long, slow pan across a scene to build tension.The 70s/80s TV version of The Incredible Hulk, even though they changed the name of the titular character and had none of the supporting characters from the original comic, still is far more powerful.  You gave a damn about David Banner and wanted to tune in the next week to see him find a cure, or at least inner peace.  At the end of this film, you'll be wondering: ""What in Stan Lee's name were they all thinking?""",Hulk
660,habeeb-2,no masterpiece but decent enough,7,22 June 2003,"The Hulk does have it's fair share of problems but in the end is decent summer entertainment. The biggest problem with the film is the pacing. Ang Lee takes a little too much time setting up Bruce Banner's origin. I understand that he really wants this to be a story and character driven film and there are some engaging scenes in the first half but too much of the same information is repeated over and over again. I am usually a very patient person at the movies but even I began to squirm and fidget a little bit. I'm reminded of a line Monty Python liked to use: ""Get on with it""!! I really feel that if they had cut 20- 25 minutes this would have been a great film instead of merely a good one. Anyway enough with the negatives, let's get to what i did like about the film. The acting was excellent. All four lead actors are excellent, making their characters into complex interesting individuals. Despite all the complaining on the Internet, i thought the CG Hulk was excellent. The amount of facial expressions they were able to give him was astonishing. The effects weren't 100% perfect but they do the job good enough. After awhile i didn't even think of the Hulk as an effect. The last 45 minutes of the movie were GREAT! They almost completely make up for the slow beginning. From the moment the hulk escaped from the base up till the ending was awsome and completely engaging. The sight of the Hulk battling the military and leaping around were spectacular to watch. Warning! Spoiler ahead. i also liked the final battle between the Hulk and his father. A lot of people and critics said it was a let down, but i thought it was a very poetic ending. I really feel a sequel would be even better because, like X-men, they don't have to do alot of exposition. Overall rating- 7/10",Hulk
661,romeovoid,Definitely worth it!,9,29 June 2003,"I highly recommend this movie.  I found the time to delve into the Bruce's origin worthwhile, as it was inventive (it deviates from the comic books) and compelling.Yes, it's not frame to frame mayhem and destruction.  But, the action is well placed and thoroughly in tune with the rest of the movie.  In other words, the action does not overwhelm the narrative.I saw the mini features for The Hulk on the SciFi channel and formed a negative impression of the CGI effects.  But after seeing the effects in the context of the entire film, I say BRAVO.  The Hulks facial expressions makes it really easy for the viewer to have empathy for his confusion and rage.What a story!  Again the critics have it wrong. This a mature person's action film.",Hulk

They did however manage to make the computer version of Hulk look just like Banner. And the Hulk wasn't as bad as he could be.Not really worth your time.I only watched it because it was on SciFi on a Sunday afternoon. Don't let the previous writer fool you.The best scene though is where Banner sees Hulk in the mirror, as Hulk is taking over the human side of Banner.",Hulk
663,jasmine_kung,Brilliant filmmaking!,9,28 June 2003,"Roger Ebert said the Hulk was a comic book movie for people who wouldn't be caught dead watching a comic book movie. Well, I'm one of the people who wouldn't be caught dead watching not only a comic book movie but any summer blockbusters. I'm much more an arthouse and foreign film fan. The last comic book movie I remember seeing was the first Batman. I thought that's lightweight fun. I don't remember much from that movie, but I do remember it didn't touch me emotionally in any way. Hey, it's a comic book movie! The Hulk is a completely different film. It's a suspense drama based on a comic book and what a brilliant filmmaking this is!The way the filmmaker told us the story made us emotionally feel for the Hulk. He withheld the Hulk's source of rage until close to the end. When it's revealed, it's so powerful that it made me burst into tears. Sorry, US Army. Love you guys, but I was rooting for the Hulk all the way because of the emotional investment I put in the Bruce Banner character as the story unfolded. And what a stunning visual style Ang Lee adapted to tell the story! He made scientific experiments look cool! All the shots of blood, DNA, eyes, atomic bomb explosions were amazing. I was awe struck by all the inventive transitions and all the morphings from one image to another. The style is not like the classical beauty of Crouching Tiger, rather, it's more like an edgy, abstract contemporary art. Yes, Ang Lee proved a comic book movie CAN be art. And I love the opening credit segment! It laid out the framework of the story in such a visually stunning way!The acting was good all around. I thought Eric Bana and Sam Elliot were excellent in their respective role. Nick Nolte was a bit over the top, but the role seems to require it. The father-and-son confrontation toward the end was almost like dramatic stage play. Great performances by Nolte and Bana. The fact that Bana held his own on that stage versus a theme-stealing Nolte proves to me that he's not just a pretty face. He can act. Jennifer Connelly's performance was restraint but good. Her face while holding Bruce after the mayhem in SF was heartbreaking. I wish Lee would show her face after hearing the news of the bomb rather than Elliot's. Her character was the emotion center of the Hulk, not her father. This is a film that doesn't spell out everything. It requires the audience to think. The psychological battles waging in Bruce Banner's head were revealed in dreams and images. After I saw it for the first time last week, I wasn't clear on some of the points of the story and thought the film had a few flaws. I just saw the film for the second time and I thought everything was brilliantly done. In its core, the Hulk is an arthouse comic book movie. It's made for adults who appreciate their entertainment with a brain and a heart, even in summertime.",Hulk
664,jdolan74,Big fat dumb green movie,3,20 June 2003,"Okay... not every good movie HAS to be an origin story.  I'm almost getting sick to death of the origin story.  I'd rather see the movie that makes the origin a mystery... the way Star Wars did back in the old days.  Just jump right in the action.  Do we really need to see JAWS as a tuna?  How he swam and learned to eat his first seal.  No thanks.  Indiana Jones waited till the third film and a TV series before we got an inkling of how Indy picked up that whip and got so `fraid `o snakes.  As much as I wasn't the biggest fan of Spiderman, they did do the origin bit justice and they didn't make it feel so dragged out.  With The Hulk we are not so lucky.  I mean, Ang Lee goes crazy with the flashbacks and while its innovative editing has some fantastic ideas, it eventually steals from the drama.  But don't blame the actors.  They were good.  It's the writers who should be locked in a room with the Hulk dogs.  Man... they just blah, blah, blah the movie into one gigantic bore.  It's funny because one would think that you'd have more trouble with a movie like X-Men where there are a ton of characters, but this flick, which basically has five roles... They saturate the story with more psycho-babble than the Matrix... and this time, it's unintelligible psycho-babble.  There is no truth in what the people are saying and feeling. It's like the worst comic book writing you've ever read.  The five people are stretched so thin, that each turns out to barely be one-dimensional. Ultimately, they would have been better off beginning the movie where it ends... the guy you don't know too much about, who rights all these wrongs... and then we learn who he is... basically the TV show.  Yeah. They should have pulled a Charlie's Angels.  Oh, and I have to mention the title credits.  If I see one more f***ing DNA sequence ala X-Men, Spiderman, you name it... can't we be original?  They're all basically ripping off Fight Club at the end of the day anyway.  I will say this about the special effects.  They were good, but I am sad to report that there is something just a little too synthetic about the big green guy.  It's not as bad as Jar Jar Binks... but he ain't no Gollum either.  And I was up for the challenge of accepting the idea to make the guy more than an actor in face paint, but eventually, I think I am going to fall victim to the belief that it may have actually been the better way to go.  There's no empathy.  His fight scenes are great.  But movies need to be more than just fight scenes.  They need wit and believable situations.  The characters need charm.  They need magic. This movie lacked that magic.  Its not the worse film I've ever seen, however I can't remember being more disappointed.  Grade: C",Hulk
665,RickyMovieMan,A good adaption of the comic (*Spoilers),7,17 December 2003,"Personally, when I heard about Hulk' I was very weary about watching it. My friends went to see it in the theaters and their comments were mixed. Some of them liked it while others had nothing but bad things to say. So that would make anyone think, Wow, I'm kind of afraid of it now. If I don't like it, then I will have wasted my money, but how will I know if I like it if I don't see it. So, I did the reasonable thing. I waited until it came to DVD to view it. 	My wife did NOT want to see it. She had no desire to, so I watched it by myself. And I could see why a person would think either way about it. I, from my standpoint, liked it a good deal and I only had a few beefs' about it. It was enjoyable watching after he has discovered that he can change. The visual effects, which were the biggest issue anyone had about the movie, were done well and I believe it was because the visual effects designers knew that if it wasn't done a certain way, it would look ridiculous. I don't know if this is the best way to say it, but it just didn't look fake. It looked real. Another thing that I noticed was that you could see hints of Eric Bana (who did extremely well as Bruce Banner) in the face of the Hulk.	The most enjoyable sequence of the whole flick is when the Hulk escapes from the underground facility and is being chased by tanks, helicopters, and jets. You get the idea of just HOW strong the Hulk is during this sequence. (Oh, by the way my wife was watching it at this point.) My wife asked me how exact this was to the comic. She was concerned most of all with the size of the Hulk. It seems extreme to those who have never read the comic, but it is true to form that the Hulk was that big, that he could jump those long distances and grow even larger than he already was when he was angered more as the Hulk. 	Here are the issues that I could see people having biffs about. First off, there were a lot of funny transitions between scenes. Funny' meaning that they were designed in the format of a comic book (several boxes on the screen at one time showing different people. This was Ang Lee's artistic venture in to making people aware that this is fictitious piece of work and a comic book type of fiction (which is much different). Though at times it is amusing, some could find it very distracting. 	The other issue that might be a distraction for some is the ending with the fight between Eric Bana and Nick Nolte as their monster counterparts. It was okay, but I felt that the movie could have ended with an open question of What will happen to Bruce?' and Will Bruce's father return?' It should have ended with the Hulk turning back to Bruce on the streets of San Francisco. That's just my opinion at least. 	Overall, I would recommend this movie to people who are looking for fun fights and visual effects. I would not recommend it to those who have a closed mind' and can't accept what they see on screen. Like a comic book transports their audience in to that world, you must allow Hulk' to do the same.",Hulk
666,de_gib,"""Hulk"" deserved to be more of a smash.",7,16 April 2008,"On a budget of $120 million, Hulk (2003) made $132 million. This makes me wonder, does this lower the bar for the box office expectations of the new Incredible Hulk movie, coming out in 2008. But first, I recommend you see this Hulk, in a different universe and starring Eric Bana, so you can compare the two. This Hulk is actually very good and was better than I had expected. But did its flaws really weigh it down?If you've read the comic book series, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, you know the story - otherwise, I can't say much more. But it seems to play the typical mutation in comics, caused by a gamma ray experiment. The creation is the ""Incredible Hulk"" - a giant, green, muscle-bound creation of pure surprise and unexpectedness. As you've probably heard before, you won't like him when he's angry. I can't guarantee you'll like the movie either (a lot of people didn't) but the CGI animators were at the top of their game making this movie. And director Ang Lee won't be recognized for this film a lot in regards to his own work, but his own touch is clearly in the film, and you know what that means: greatness.So, if you're checking out the new Hulk movie, try to at least rent this movie first. There's no saying you'll be glad you did, as many people didn't see that. But in my opinion it was a good movie, and worthy of a big old HULK-SMASH!",Hulk
667,fly4taiwan,Superhero movie unlike any others,9,21 June 2003,"Director Ang Lee delivers the traditional comic superhero onto big screen with a whole new approach.  Instead of just dumping in tons of mindless action and stupid emotion twists into the movie like other ones (Batman, X-men, Spiderman), we see someone who's more realistic to a real human in the real world.  The fear and the emotion in the movie is just so engaging, and the action scenes are superb.  CG is good from ILM, music is good too. I like how Ang Lee plays the presentation of the segments on the screen, that's really some refreshing view.  I gave it 9/10, recommend for people who has some longer attention span and expect to see something that has more sense than mindless actions.  If you love spiderman then you probably won't enjoy this movie, but it is good, maybe just not what you want it to be (with mindless actions again).",Hulk
668,halderic,Surprisingly Good,6,20 June 2003,"I just got back from watching an AM showing of Hulk on June 20th, Friday, and i must say i was impressed with this movie.  It's not your usual mindless action summer blockbuster.  There is nice depth to the story and plenty of character development.  The Hulk has limited screen time, which is nice, so we don't get sick of watching him too much.  There have been people complaining the CGI effects dont look very well, but they do look a whole lot better in the theatre than they did in the trailers.  And yes, there are times when the Hulk doesnt look real, but then it is a comic book movie, and you have to take certain liberties when watching such a movie.  The movie has many emotionally powerful scenes (scenes that the x-men movies and spiderman lacked, but needed).  On a whole i enjoyed this more than the before mentioned films, though i did enjoy them.  I want a good script along with good CGI effects in a movie, and this delivers enough of both to be very enjoyable.  Don't let negative word of mouth keep you from seeing this movie, go see it, form your own opinion.",Hulk
669,jchernesky,Wow...this was garbage.,2,7 November 2003,"I love superhero movies, I loved the Hulk TV show, I loved the premise of Ang Lee staying true to the real comic book Hulk (15 feet tall, etc.).  I didn't mind the CGI in this film, in fact it's some of the best parts to the movie...which is a sad statement.  Despite all of the things I like, I really found this movie to be a sad disappointment.My faults of this film (SPOILERS AHEAD):1) Incredibly annoying editing - nothing particularly clever about it (unlike Crouching Tiger), just a jumbled screen with too many images flying around without sense or purpose - as though he was making a video for MTV.2) Too many plot holes to go through in this review, no doubt the result of one too many screenwriters involved in the writing process.  An unknown writer submitting this as a spec script would be laughed out of the room. This is obviously one of those films that got the green light first and then the script was developed.3) Murky ending at best with no real explanation for the motive behind Nick Nolte's anger, nor his sudden transformation into an almighty beast in the closing scenes.  The scene where Bruce is tied to the chair and his father (Nolte) bites the electric cable...man that was almost too embarrassing to watch.My advice to anyone who was looking forward to this film but hasn't had the chance yet - don't waste your time.  Better to keep the mystery of the unknown than spoil the surprise with the reality of this trash.ebhp",Hulk
670,jimpludthura,true to the spirit of comic books,10,27 June 2003,"Ang Lee shows why he is one of the best visionary directors in the world today. ""HULK"" is perfectly cast, ingeniously and innovatively directed, and uniquely possesses a perfect blend between story and special effects.  The special effects are so good that the Hulk actually looks real. It is a fantastic film with great performances from the lead actors. What I really liked the most about this film was that it reflected the in-depth story-telling of comic books in its golden period of the 80s and 90s. None of this elementary superhero story-telling between good and evil generally directed to wider viewing audiences. Because this is not a film for the kids. Instead we see more darker themes which are more apparent in the actual comic books. It is abundantly clear that Ang Lee has made this film especially for the comic book enthusiasts, electing to stay true to its spirit, ignoring the usual Hollywood tendency to ensure a wider viewing audience i.e. children will enjoy it. Studio execs will hopefully realise that this is how comic book adaptations should be made.",Hulk
671,MetalHead13,"Worst ""Marvel"" movie I've ever seen....",2,25 June 2003,"I really don't know what the director and producer were thinking when they created this movie..... First--the hulk looked terrible....he was completely fake....looking like Shrek on steroids.  I don't know what went wrong in ILM, but they did a horrible job with their main character. Second--cheesy lines filled the entire script.... I know the hulk always says ""You're making me angry....you don't like me when i'm angry.."" but that line is so cheesy i wanted to cry.... Third--Just the overall story was bad....how is it that the hulk can jump for ten miles in a single bound??  He leaps in about ten jumps from the deserts of Nevada to San Francisco (while fighting off tanks, jets, and helicopters....catching the missiles in midair and throwing them back to his foes) And why did the giant mutated dogs just explode into green mush when the hulk hit them really hard??  Did they eat too much puppy chow before they left the house??      Also, i have to ask what the director what thinking about the finale.... what kind of ending was that??  *Spoiler*  After he gets hit my a nuke shot from a jet....he somehow survives....so i guess he's invincible....which probably means....his sequels will never stop... :( All in all, ""The Hulk"" is terrible.   I'm putting it my 'worst movies list,' i have no idea what the director was thinking.....director did a terrible job with his camera work....his in/out movements from one scene to another get old and can cause more nausia than you get already from watching the movie....don't waste your greens on this garbage.....i give it a 2/10 stars..",Hulk
672,mcfine,Simply beautiful,9,21 June 2003,"Thats what was going through my head throughout the movie. It was near perfect. The opening sequence couldn't have been any smoother in setting up the story. The story was beautifully told, the CGI was great and never had me thinking, ""Oh men that looks crappy"" like some scenes in Spiderman and that awful fight scene in the Matrix Reloaded.What I liked about the movie is that it didn't fall in to the typical formula for comic to big screen movies. Build up to the creation of the hero, introduction of a bad guy and then right back to regular action movie. The story was so well blended into the movie that it never felt like the usual squashing a story line in for an excuse for the super hero in action.The comic book style shots were also well done. The only reason I can see anyone not liking this movie is because Banner hadn't turned into the hulk in the first 15 minutes. But thats exactly the kind of movie I dislike when you forget the plot and are looking for any excuse for super hero action. In the end there is more than enough of Hulk smashing. The last fight scene was a tid bit much but other than that the acting and everything else was well done.Best marvel movie as far as I am concerned. Gave it a 9 out of 10",Hulk

Personally i found the acting to be extremely dull and almost amateur-like. But perhaps it had something to do with the horrible plotline and the amazingly moronic dialogue. Basicly the story tries for big time epic drama but stumples and falls almost immediatly.I find the horror of this movie surprising after seeing the pretty succesful movie adaptations of other comicbooks heroes, like Spiderman and X-men.I give it a 1/10, and i think its incredible that i didnt fall asleep while watching it.",Hulk
674,Ephemeriis,I can't believe they actually pulled it off...,8,22 June 2003,"Going in to this movie, I didn't expect much.  The trailers and previews all looked really bad.  I'm not even that big a fan of the Hulk.  But...the tickets were free...so why not?I walked out of that theatre completely amazed.  I can't believe they managed to pull it off.  I found myself saying words I'd never expected to hear uttered - ""it's good.""Now, that isn't to say that the movie was the greatest piece of cinematography ever...or that it had no flaws....  Merely that it was a good film.  The acting was good, the story was entertaining, plenty of action, and amazingly enough the CGI was believable within the context of the movie.I honestly did not expect to like this movie.  I would not have gone to see it if the tickets were not free.  But having seen it, I am very glad I did.",Hulk
675,superaska,The vision of Ang Lee,5,4 July 2003,"I didn't find Hulk so well. Story is not so deep even if the movie is quite long. This is not necessarily bad to spend time to settle characters and story but here, it's sometimes boring. Actually Hulk takes a long time before really starting whereas the ending is quite expeditious and the final battle is a great disappointment. Acting is okay but not amazing except Nick Nolte whose way of playing is in osmosis with his character in the movie.The most interesting in the movie, and which seems to me very positive, is that we get the vision of an author : Ang Lee. He gives us how he see the Hulk and his story. Despite i think a lot of obligations and difficulties linked to the adaptation of comic books, Lee seemed to have a great freedom to make this movie. He tried many things, imposed his style  and has made action scenes which are sometimes great and not set like a movie clip. Finally, i didn't really like the movie but i truly respect the work of Ang Lee as he didn't made a formated movie. 5/10.",Hulk
676,sherrimichel2004,Hulk Review,7,18 June 2008,"This is an anti-blockbuster. From the outside, it looks like a big cgi fest. I kind of wish it was. This is what happens when you get an art-house director to direct a comic book film. Now I love comic books (Ultimate Spider-Man is my favorite)but there needs to be some fun in them. When Ang Lee was offered this, he was probably worried that people would think he would be selling out by making a silly action film. So the film had to be made as serious and deep as possible. So he got three screenwriters to create a mess. Ang, it's the Hulk. Yes it should have some emotion, but people paid to see HULK SMASH, not hulk, let's talk about our feelings so we can control the beast inside. This has always been a hard film to watch (and this is from a guy who watched Once upon a time in the west and loved it.)",Hulk
677,Elektrum,Slow and mediocre.,6,22 June 2003,"This film was slow, and Ang Lee's attempts at comic-book feel (through the use of split-screens and multiple angles) degraded the quality of the otherwise decent cinematography.Eric Bana was fortunately a good fit for the role of The Hulk. The film's problems were primarily the pacing of the story. Midway through the film, you assume that it will have to last another 2 hours if it continues at the same speed. And somehow, the film manages to last another two hours, or at least the audience will feel that way.",Hulk
678,Elijya,Walk in Late,8,18 June 2003,"I'll begin with a warning: You do not actually see the Hulk until the 45 minute mark of the movie. I know this, because I was wondering where the heck he was and kept looking at my watch. This lull at the beginning of the movie is quite noticeable and annoying.During this time, Ang Lee takes the chance to do some very cool comicbook-like editing to the movie, which keeps those 45 minutes moving, as well as some great character establishment. But if you're just looking for the more compelling scenes with Hulk, walk in late.After you finally see the hulk, you'll know the wait was worth it. Of course, everyone is complaining about the CGI, but it didn't bother me. I thought it was excellent CGI, and required little suspension of disbelief for me to enjoy it. For those of you who still can't get by it, well, I'd say you're being closed-minded and missing out on a good time.The CGI was not only good enough for me, the battle sequences were incredible, with cool ideas (which I won't give spoilers about), with the exception of the movies final battle scene. It uses something which was introduced in the movie earlier, and seemed cool at the time, but was just poorly executed for this final battle. Sometimes with these comicbook movies, I get the impression they never know how to end it. The Epilogue makes for a great laugh, thoughAs for the performances, Bana, Connelly, and Eliot are all fantastic, going above and beyond for what is sort of supposed to be just a big, silly summer action movie. This, of course, is probably credible to Ang Lee. But beyond these three, Nick Nolte shines with a brutally vicious and evil performance (much better than the Adam-Sandler-film-like-villainy of Josh Lucas).Oh, and if you walk in late, you will miss the best joke in the film: Keep an eye on the lookout when teenage banner first gets to Berkeley for two guys walking out of a building.",Hulk

This movie had magic powers, it made good actors look bad. Since when can the Hulk fly? (or is jumping 2 miles considered a high jump?), since when are bullets impenetrable on human skin, I mean he's still human isn't he?why did the dad choose a POODLE to experiment with? a poodle? really? how come the Hulk is fighting dogs (which by the way magically exploded in the air into green mist..again the poodle) with shorts on but when he turns human hes naked? the shorts disintegrated?

The movie comes close at times, but with a $150 million budget, you'd think we'd be more afraid of this CGI Hulk than Lou Ferrigno's fright- wig-and-green-body-paint version - we're not. Still, the scenes where the Hulk is in action are fresh and exciting enough that the film well earns your nine-plus dollars. The snail-paced, `human' scenes, however, just seem to hang there more lifelessly than the screen curtain. At least these occasionally joyless moments will give you plenty of time to get more popcorn and take a leak, or even a long, luxurious dump, depending on where you are in the two-and-a-half hour movie.While the action sequences are truly great, it bothered me that the original comic book storyline was actually toned down, believe it or not, to the detriment of the film's believability (isn't the stereotype supposed to be that comic books are the kids' medium?).In the comic, Bruce Banner's father is a physically and verbally abusive, raging alcoholic who beat Bruce's mother to death. After witnessing this, young Banner fell to the floor, emotionally frozen, cradling his mother's bloody corpse without shedding so much as a single tear. In the film, the father is a mad scientist who, in one clumsily staged piece, accidentally falls on someone with a knife. I guess a murderous father with a drinking problem doesn't make for a best-selling action figure.The emotional impact was further softened when Ang Lee jumbled up the character's history and muddled the story in an attempt to make this a more ""personal"" film. Add up the incessant comic-strip-style, multiple-screen-splitting (which after a while grows into more of a tiresome distraction than an innovation), the Enigma-esque background music (enough with the idea that wailing and chanting automatically translates into a movie being soulful), and angst-ridden, soft-spoken dialogue (WHY IS EVERYBODY WHISPERING? WHAT'S THE SECRET?!?!? HERE'S AN IDEA -- EVEN TORTURED SOULS SPEAK UP EVERY NOW AND THEN, GODDAMMIT!!!), and you have an often self-indulgent, art-house-wannabe film that should have been called THE INCREDIBLE ANG LEE'S hulk.Great directors and screenwriters are supposed to know when to get themselves and their egos out of the way of a story.

Second-rate comic book writers, at their cliché', hyperbole-loving worst, would have known better.Throughout the film, Eric Bana's, Jennifer Connely's, and Sam Elliot's acting, much like the uneven script, runs the gamut of impressive creative achievement to borderline-embarrassing hack work.As for Nick Nolte, well, he's very busy doing something on the screen, but I'm not sure if you can technically call it acting. He's running around stalking people, shooting himself up with experimental drugs, and biting into electric cables. I had a funny feeling this is what he'd be doing even if there wasn't a movie happening around him. I'm being kind when I say his portrayal of David Banner had more ham in it than Mama Cass in '74.Since such a large chunk of the film's production time was wrapped up in just coming up with the look of the Hulk, I'm hoping that when the sequel arrives he'll appear much more, well.incredible, and a great deal more savage.

684,borntrini,"Good, but could have been better",8,3 July 2003,"The Hulk started off very slow. In trying to get the viewers more acquainted with the characters, Ang Lee failed to keep an eye on the clock. But once you got beyond that, the movie moved at a very fast pace with awesome special effects.As a former comic book collector, I was pleased with the representation of the comic book character. Unlike The Incredible Hulk TV series, this Hulk was more of an experimental nightmare, rather than some green guy dosed up on supersteriods.Most people complained of the animated, or computer image Hulk that was used numerous times in the movie. But they have to remember that this is a comic book character, and to be able to make this Hulk just like the comic book, you need the computer effects.I think where the movie failed was to make viewers really connect with the relationship, or feelings, between Bruce and Betty. I don't know why, but I didn't feel that it convinced me enough that they were really in love. Not the same way I felt about Peter Parker and Mary Jane. Don't get me wrong. I know that Bruce and Betty were in love, I just didn't feel it. There was just something missing. Because of that, there was an almost disconnection in trying to make that love spill between Beauty and the Beast.Overall, I think the Hulk was a good movie. I would recommend those who haven't seen it to do so. Drink some strong coffee to get through the first 30 to 45 minutes. But once you do, hold on for some great action and effects....8/10.",Hulk

I thought I could only rely on Lord of the Rings and Star Wars to give me that. Character Development, Emotional story, and of course..Hulk smashing.Although, not too much Hulk Smashing. I doubt though kids will be pleased with the movie, out of its 2 hour and 20 minute running time, only about 20 minutes of that are action.This didnt bother me any since the movie was done so well, but indeed it will probably make the kids squirm a bunch. I absolutely love the split screen comic book like useage, Just like pages from one of the books. Excellent.Is this movie better than X2? IMO..Absolutely.I liked X2 alot, but the action scenes were way too short, Stryker was probably the most boring villian Ive seen in a movie, granted the character development was great, but when the first 5 mins of a movie own the rest of the film..somthing is wrong.But anyway, about Hulk..Yeah, Great movie, enjoyed it a ton.One thing I'm really appreciative of, Jack Kirby and Stan Lee being credited around the start of the end credits in big letters, rather than a small spec of a section at the end.On the whole, it's a really impressive movie.

688,vodkatini,that's ok,7,27 June 2003,"i'm not a big fan of action movie and thus nothing disappoints me in this new work of Lee.  in fact i find it quite interesting. the action is impressive. i like the camera works also. the description to characters is ok, especially the inner world of scientists, although i would be happier if it can go a bit deeper. of course it's still much deeper than movies like Matrix Reloaded. perhaps it's no easy task to keep a balance between certain commercial elements and Lee's style. i'm not saying that Lee can't make a commercial-success movie. Crouching Tiger is an example. it's not the best work of Lee but certainly worth seeing.  but of course please don't expect something like T2.  7/10",Hulk
689,Pi72,Interesting and different superhero adaptation,7,25 June 2005,"Hulk is an excellent action/drama and science-fiction film based on the classic superhero (or antihero) The Incredible Hulk. Following the trend on the last years about recycling comic superheroes, Hulk's turn became a very interesting alternative to other formulas used in several of these adaptations.Knowing that many people consider this movie as dull and boring, please let me state that it's far from being dull. After the critics towards Spiderman just scratching the surface of character development, and where other movies simply failed miserably (e.g. Daredevil), we should be grateful that we can finally see some depth in the main character as we're used in the good comics.Ang Lee's direction shows his usual way of telling stories, in a sensitive and personal way. Instead of letting the movie drown in its limitless action possibilities, he conducted the story through a sensible path. The editing work, which remarkably resembles comic frames in many scenes, and contains some awesome transitions, is simply wonderful.And all this not forgetting Hulk's main point: a green, angry mass of power and destruction. The movie has some of the best action scenes I've seen lately, which makes me wonder what is expecting some people who blame this movie for its lack of massive fights against entire armies. My opinion is that the action scenes of Hulk are perfectly balanced; more than showing Hulk's sheer strength but never going completely overboard. And also showing some of Hulk's main weaknesses, keeping the character real and not entering the area of fantasy.One side of this movie that people also seems to throw tantrums about, is the refurbishing of Hulk's origins. The story of Bruce Banner's transformation has been updated with including today's technology, and making it in my humble opinion much more interesting and 'believable' than the original. Not being a huge fan of Hulk's comics, I didn't feel personally attached to the original story, so I actually liked it more. But I can understand that the purists or the die-hard fans will be disappointed by these changes.Along with Hulk's origins, the plot includes good science-fiction elements. Don't misunderstand me; the stuff is in general barely believable. A scientist conducting advanced genetic experiments in 1965 (all by himself!) is not a good start... But in the end, it doesn't matter. This superhero adaptation is as good science-fiction as other excellent adaptations like X-Men (including its sequel X2), where others will just remain as good or bad action films with just some sci-fi scattered around. Where others lost their opportunity, Hulk didn't.What other things are good in this movie? Well, the main actors all do a good work, specially Jennifer Conelly and Nick Nolte. The special effects are great, and while there are entire scenes made just of CGI, they're still not the strong point of the movie. The plot and dialogues aren't just bridges between computer generated action scenes, which I'm thankful for. Furthermore, the plot is also rich in references to the comic, Hulk's enemies and other subtle things. The movie is full of small details (has anyone noticed the frog over the hat in the final scene?) which reward you when watching it a second or third time.The main down of the movie might be that followers aren't used to see Hulk in this way, a deep and sensitive character, and probably expected more action and enemy-smashing and less deep dialogues running after child traumas... Which could explain its relatively low rating and some bad critics. Maybe I just connected very well with this movie and that's why I put it so well, but I can also see that the elements of this film, taken independently, also have their merits and all together form a solid production. In my opinion, of all the comic superhero adaptations, Hulk is the most interesting and best quality one which I've watched to date. I just wish people would concentrate more on enjoying this different view of a superhero's life. But oh well, each one has different tastes.And one final note. The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful!",Hulk
690,DownLoAdEr,Hulkin pile of crxp,1,12 June 2003,"I am sorry, but after seeing the screener of this, for the first time I am able to say that a film sent me to sleep. I was waiting for an all action MARVEL comic film..............soreeeeeee it ain't!!!! All I can say is go to X2 instead! ...and DO NOT take your kids to this!! You will only hurt after!0 out of 10sorry guys, this is a bummer of a film",Hulk
691,richyreay,Ang Lee loses himself in wipe city,1,12 July 2003,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. I know people have complained about the lack of action, but that really didn't bother me. I am interested in the psychology behind the characters and the depth at which that can be explored. No my main problem is with the ""stylistic"" choices made by Mr Lee, after an interesting visual opening that seemed to fit with introducing any kind of comic book movie it should have stopped there, but no Ang Lee decided it would be ""in keeping with comic book stylings"" to utilise frame breaking wipes and split screen action that is disorienting and sucks any drama from the film completely. The CGI was impressive, but not the best ever seen. So many plot points muddled into obscurity leaving far too many situations unexplained. Interesting character moments are opened and then not followed through, maybe this was the script or maybe it was the direction but whoever is to blame should be hauled out into the streets of south central Los Angeles and left to the social reprebates who inhabit that wonderfully violent area. While I eagerly anticipated this film, and got more excited as I heard about the areas that would be explored I left the cinema feeling as if I had been physically and emotionally assaulted by Messrs Lee and Shamus. Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly and the ever popular Sam Elliot were hoplessly wasted, as was the opportunity to show a visually startling transformation from man to rampaging green id. No marks out of ten for this one boys. To all those in the UK eagerly awaiting this movie, I suggest you don't bother wasting your money. This film is a template for what is wrong with the studio system in film making today. All bucks and no bang.",Hulk
692,G-Faust,Mainly excellent..,6,26 July 2003,"I found this film much more intriguing than other recent Marvel comic book adaptations. Hulk combines a dark, sophisticated plot with action and some great performances from the likes of Jennifer Connely.Apart from the CG animation, this film is excellent. I find it difficult to believe that this film has a lower rating than Spiderman and also that a large amount of people are pivoting their argument around the idea that Hulk is poor purely based on the CG. Perhaps Ang Lee should have used a muscley man wearing green body paint and a bright green wig eh?",Hulk
693,magicrevolver,Ang Lee Pulls it off.,8,14 August 2003,"This has really been dividing people and critics alike. Personally I think it's a great film. I guess that people expecting the usual summer blockbuster no-brainer might be disappointed, it might (shock horror) make them think a bit! There's been criticism that Ang Lee has tried to mix art-house sensibilities with the comic book blockbuster but as far as I can see it he pulls it off admirably. Ok, you don't get to see Hulk smashing things up straight away but when you think of the TV series you didn't in that either. The spilt screen comic book effects work perfectly and really look wonderful. The story is well told and the hulk himself looks great - when the action comes it's worth it! Overall I feel this film deserves to be up there with the other great comic book adaptations like Spiderman, Batman and X-men.",Hulk
694,d2-d4,Good movie...absolutely horrible fx on the Hulk,7,9 April 2004,"This movie had it all : plot, story, dialogue, cast, history, set design, etc. Why oh why couldn't they have paid someone to do a better job on the Hulk cgi. Come on, we didn't wait an hour or so to get a glimpse at a Roger Rabbit-esque cartoon. He was big and strong and ready to take on all comers but they may as well have had a censor dot fighting the bad guys, then we would at least be left with a sense of mystery and possibly awe. The only reason this movie doesn't get a 9 out of 10 is the cgi. Otherwise, I absolutely loved it. Peace.",Hulk
695,NewOrleansMovies,Disappointed,1,29 November 2003,"I was very disappointed with the outcome of this film. Afterall, Jennifer Connally, an Oscar winning actress, unfortunetly for her didn't pick a better script for great acting potential; which was at least recognized by the Academy. Not worth any money!",Hulk
696,bourdan,Packs too much of a wallop to hold to one movie.,5,23 December 2003,"It's a fine film of its nature but I think the main problem that it has is the fact that it put too much in the film's story to make every thing seems implausible. If they just stick to the simple origin of the Hulk instead of trying to put too much too soon, it would have been a better story.  If they wanted to tell more of the Hulks origin, they should have waited for the sequel instead of packing this film with too much detail. The special effect does not do the character justice, and we really don't see the big guy intill 45 minutes into the picture. The acting is top notch, and the direction is fine but with out a script with some coherency  (Hollywood's biggest sin) you don't have much of a film at all.They should have waited for a better script.",Hulk
697,emopunk628,Not worth it,1,3 January 2004,"Warning, this review may ruin the movie.This movie was terrible! I couldn't believe how bad it was overall. The movie lacked many things. One being a normal camera view, it was cool for the first couple of minutes with the comic book angles, but not the whole movie. Also it lacked a sense of intelligence, I (along with many others) did not understand why every transition was them zooming out from an object, especially a rock growing a fungus on it. Lastly, it lacked The Hulk. When you make a movie on a guy who turns into a beast, make him the beast for more than two scenes. The movie also jumped around the size of the hulk. The original hulk did not grow 15 feet tall, he was just an extremely strong man. He also did not the ability to jump 100's of feet. All in all, this film is not worthy of the name The Hulk, and is not worthy of our money.",Hulk
698,emopunk628,please just shoot me now,1,12 May 2004,"I watched this movie expecting nothing special. Well, they upset me, they did more than nothing, they tried to make this movie artistic. I don't get it. How can you screw something up so well? They tried to add characters never before seen, tried to make a puzzle to the movie, tried to add cool special effects, and then tried to pretty much create a brand new Hulk. The true Hulk was not 100 feet tall and couldn't jump for 10 miles at a time. I think they should have read the comic book before making the movie. Also, the puzzle that can't be solved. I am tempted to rent the DVD of this movie to try and get an insight on all the zoom outs from a rock growing mold on it. Lastly, a good 20 mins of the movie the guy was the HULK! Whats up with that?! Not even having the true main character in a movie is like taking the beef patty out of a hamburger, nobody wants it. This movie should have just been should have just quit while it was ahead and just released only the merchandise.",Hulk
699,emopunk628,Sheer Crap,1,31 May 2006,"I wasn't expecting much, they really didn't do that great with the daredevil movie but I did expect this to be better than that, but it wasn't. They tried to make it artistic by zooming in on rocks, congrats you figured out how to bore your audience to death. They tried to pull something like the Warriors by going between comic strip and movie, they did not do well with it. It also had a very weak plot to it. The worst part of the movie was that he was only the Hulk for about 1/8th of it all. I saw more moldy rocks than I saw of the Hulk. I think I was more entertained by the redneck couple in front of me. The mom with a mullet and the dad with greasy long hair. At least they were funny.",Hulk
700,pancakes27,"I found it pretty good... But of course, it is not without flaws. Nothing is perfect.:) Enjoyable. *SPOILERS AHEAD*",8,14 March 2004,"I only just got around to watching the movie today. When it came out in the movies, I heard so many bad things about it... how fake it looked, how long winded and boring it was, how stupid it was, how it wasn't all that great etc... the list goes on... We can see it in the debates here as well. Then there were of course mixed critics about it but either way, I wanted to see it for myself to judge, as always but I never got around to it, due to lack of time :(.So... I just watched the DVD and I was surprisingly rather amused by it. I must say that I didn't expect much from it and actually didn't even know what to expect anymore. But I quite liked it.I've skimmed through some of the comments made in the threads here and also managed to grasp some of the msgs in between the flaming posts :-D hehe... and this is what I think:""If The Hulk was announced in the beginning that it was going to be a trilogy... right from the start and that the story is going to be split into different parts... I think the critics might be a little different."" It's kind fo hard to say now, now that most people's frame of mind are in the ""this movie was so bad I walked out after 10 mins or fell asleep or whatever. But I personally just saw this movie as an introduction. Why? Well... :As many in here mentioned... IT WAS A LOOOOONG movie. As others mentioned... ""Where in the world was THE HULK??? Me wanna see mo' gweeeen guy"" However, I thought that there was more character build up by not showing the HULK all the time. It didn't overdo the character build up either but shot scenes at the right time. I guess the reason why I felt this way, when watching it was cause I walked into the movie with a very neutral frame of mind. Most that I have come across had expected this movie to be something like Spiderman, X-Men, etc... the ones which really got a better audience than previous attempts like Spawn hehe.But, what I found was that the beginning had a pretty cool introduction. It showed different parts and made one wonder what really happened. It kind of followed the mindset of the Hulk himself... Whatever he didn't know, we didn't know... The way he was emotionless most of the time, carried a fake smile every now and then... I thought that it fit with the character, esp. considering the internal turmoil that he's been going through, day in and out. It already hinted to us in the beginning how he was already as well, when Betty said to him that it wasn't his fault that it didn't work out etc... and that she just can't be with someone who's so emotionally distant... And this is what I liked in the movie too... There was consistency in that retrospect.As the movie goes on, Nick Nolte's character... I felt a mix there... One second I'm feeling p***ed off at him, the next I'm starting to feel sorry for him and I get the feeling that maybe he did what he did because of the situation... the next second he seems like a hypocrite but at the same time, you wonder if it was because despite his determination, his goodwill etc... he was weak... and ""easily"" influenced by the surroundings... self-esteem problem. If he doesn't get what he wants... he gets lost and after some time... angry because he can't solve the problem himself...
This trait passes onto Banner as well. Like father, like son... Even Banner seems to have a self confidence problem. At times he tries to act tough e.g. the scene where he tells that irritating dork to get out of the office etc... But at the same time, he never punched him or did anything drastic... Everything seemed to be a face thing... all a cover up of what was really going on inside.I felt the confusion and trauma that he was going through - as in, I felt rather sorry for Banner and all that he was going through. You could just feel his frustration of not knowing what was going on. Sure, this part could have been done better.. by adding a few scenes and taking some out... But, overall, the effect came across to me anyways. Also the part where he's talking to General Ross and he's getting grilled. That part was efficient in bringing out the confusion aspect of it all.
I could go on about the small details of build up etc. but I won't, as you're probably falling asleep, reading this already :D Hehe.
--- In the case of the filming... I thought it was nice that it changed angles here and there... camera view etc. And as for the ""24"" effect... yeah, it was a bit overdone in some areas BUT... I thought that the parts where it all looked like a comic book was pretty cool. It was a very experimental thing but new... and quite neat. Someone made a comment about whether it was necessary to shoot the same damn helicopter in all five screens haha. I agree with that point :-D... although with the helicopter in five scenes, I got an even better visual and feel of the large empty surroundings.
--- As for the CGI itself... I thought it was amusing as well. Sure, it doesn't look ""REAL""... but heck, it's an extract from a comic book... I gotta be open minded when I watch such a movie. But I definitely agree with those in here who mentioned about the details and all. The muscles and tissue texture... the face even (rather Shrek like :-D hhe), the details of the sand and dirt and wounds, the hair etc... that was all done REALLY well. Sure, it ""could've been better"" but man, it was nice enough. I also noticed that the more dirty he got, thereby having some brown, dark brown and light brown colours on his green skin, actually enabled him to blend in better with the surroundings. When all green, he stands out a bit too much but still... not too bad. If they had used a yellowy green, I think that would have made it easier to ""blend in"" to everything else. But that's besides the point really...As for the movements... he's supposed to be fast, swift, etc. And when you're that, you're going to have those cartoony movements... ""1 sec the hand is here, the next it's there..."" etc. It would have been awesome to hvae a cartoon with that CGI, that's for sure... but I still thought that it was amusing watching him smash the tanks up... That scene was cool enough. And being open minded about the fakeness etc... let that part get by with no problems :).I didn't want to bring this in but the discussion about Lord of the Rings... I can see that a lot of the stuff is CGI as well. But it's still amazing. Gollum vs. Hulk - I don't even think there should be such a comparison... The whole scenary is different... the envronment etc...When comparing it like that, maybe one could just use ""Mighty Joe Young"" for comparison... when they digitally made the big ape... That was cool too. But I think props were used as well. I can't remember but I remember something about the hairs all being computer generated.But ether way, I find both doing quite well. Gollum had a more emotional and in depth script... thus more forms of facial expressions... I was amazed by it... that's for sure... Yet with all these CGI things coming out, sometimes one just begins to take the enhancements for granted... e.g. ""Ah, about time!:D"" Hehe. But really cool.The Hulk... if he was asked to act more, then maybe it could've been done... The scene where Hulk turns back into Banner with the SWAT team all around him... the stage in between The Savege Hulk and Banner, I thought was good... If they had made the movie with that shot of him... like that... withthat skin tone etc... I think that people would be complaining less... However, as fo teh movements etc. who knows. Poeple will always complain in some way or another :-D. But that's what makes the new things better:).
But... imagine if they had used Hulk... dressed up Banner with vasts amoutn of makeup, special fx, and given him props to wear to make huge muscles... etc. and then dumped all the actions into a computer and added it to the scenes etc... maybe that would have looked more ""realistic""... But heck... comic book.... comic character... comic style movie... Cartoony is all cool :). --- What I had hoped for was a bit more time of self reflection by Banner... e.g. when he's in the desert etc... looking at the plants and wanting to rest for a while... thinking things through, when he suddenly gets interrupted again. I would have liked a scene where they'd show a bit of ""acting"" by the CGI. But I guess being interrupted during such a moment is what would p*** someone off... But I thought he made a cute and cool face when he heard that the plane couldn't turn up and he jumped right on it to bring it under the bridge hehe.--- Ahh I could go on but I won't... I'll basically make the rest short now...
As for the ending... yeah, it would've been cool to actually see the Hulk interact with ""bad guys"" for once... (okay he did that in his own house, throwing the IDIOT out of the house and into the agent car etc.) but a bit more action with other types of props. And since they were in the jungle, that could've made things interesting ;). However... it ended that way... and if it ended with another form of cliffhanger... slightly different from that... ""because we are making a trilogy""... I think the movie would have gotten slightly better reviews and this part... being long and all would be seen as an introduction.It's kind of like LOTR, Fellowship - there it was extremely long in the beginning... You just had to give it the chance... get into the story... allow yourself to let your guard down and wait patiently for things to happen... After 1.x hrs... things start to happen... And just as soon as it gets more interesting... ERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR... the movie ends and you had to wait a WHOLE YEAR before watching the second part... and the continuation... Hehe.Then watching the 2nd part... you end up watching trees for one quarter of the movie :p. Nah, I liked it too... But it got slow in the middle of the second one as well but had some really cool fight scenes... The orcs and stuff looked real cause ... they were simply makeup and a lot of them were probably ""copied and pasted"" over and over again but doing different things... The large monsters were clearly CGI but I still found them cool... Big powerful beings with swift and fast fatal swings... But either way, the 2nd Part.... Two Towers... was yet another build up for the third part.. AND that's where suddenly most of the action comes into play... You start seeing new things etc... Some parts were really quite ""fake"" but I simply looked at the scenes where one could see a glow behind the characters... as a magical thing...--- Psssh all this makes me sound ""ignorant"" I'm sure hehe... As in, very ""not critical"" towards movies... However, I often try to make the best of every movie I watch. Some of them are just hard lol. When I watched Daredevil the first time around... I was like, ""What in the world is this? What did they doooooo??? There was so much potential and they screwed it up pretty bad :(""... Then I skimmed through the movie again, this one other time and some of the scenes were so so. It really does depend on the mood when you start to watch a movie... that's for sure... A lot of it depends on expectations too.I personally have watched a movie where I didn't really like it the first time around but the 2nd time around, I ended up liking it... cause it had a deeper effect on me. Sounds weird huh? But I guess that's what can happen when you watch movies depending on the mood + attitude.
--- So, overall, I found The Hulk pretty cool. As a standalone movie, it could have definitely done a better job, with regards to the script. The last fighting scene was so so but at the same time... unsatisfying. I would have liked a bigger fight but still... whatever happened to the dad? Hehe. He passed away from the bomb shock, even after gaining power? Or was he too unstable?Ah yeah, Nick Nolte, I thought he did alright... I haven't seen him play like that for a while. The part where he goes nuts and says one thing and then the next... the whole scenary felt as if they were on a stage... performing some play... but I got the feeling, at the same time, that he was a bit of a nutcase... not really knowing what he wanted. One second he wants one thing, the next second he wants something else and starts saying that he had always wanted that something else in the first place, when in reality, he's hurt from all the years of distress... He was filled with anger... and that's what made him go crazy... But I thought the father's character could be built up a tad bit more... showing a bit more of his craziness etc... but all this adding will simply make the movie THAT long :p. I wonder if there's a director's cut of this movie or something.Either way, I enjoyed it... I dunno why but I did :-D. Hehe. The acting I found was alright... Got a comic feel to it :). Hehe. Jennifer Connelly played quite alright... She's good with those tears :D Haha. But unfortunately, I didn't feel the hurt enough... It almost got to me when the scene changed... or when they said something else etc...
To those that haven't seen it, I still recommend you to watch it and not be overly critical in the beginning. Don't expect much when watching it and you might be surprised... Someone might come and say, ""Don't waste 2.5hrs of your life for this movie etc."" but we waste so much time doing other things anyways:D Haha j/k.Check it out... and those are my $0.02 for today :).",Hulk
701,BananaKidOfDoom,Hulk smash bad movie!,4,16 April 2005,"I walked into Hulk excited. I was hoping for a joyous smash-fest movie about the Hulk and his destructive powers. However, I got majorly disappointed. The movie started out with some promise, with an acceptable origin, and a decent Bruce Banner. However, everybody else is so ridiculously different than in the comics that if you changed the Hulk and the names, you could fool somebody into thinking this wasn't even a comic movie.Now, the first thing you notice is that major characters have been removed or revamped. I never knew Betty Ross was a scientist. I didn't know Rick Jones was apparently never born. It seems so, since he is completely removed from this movie. This might be a decent movie underneath everything they made so different, but as an adaptation, it's awful.The best thing about this movie is when the Hulk is set loose. The CGI they used to make him is extremely well-done, and makes for a very believable not-so-jolly green giant. However, he also has a total of two lines, one of which is in a dream sequence. You don't hear a single ""Hulk Smash!"" throughout the entire film. Still, he's strong, and does pull a couple multiple-mile leaps. So really, the Hulk is the best thing about it.Now, the humans aren't all that great. They came up with a decent way of modernizing how Bruce Banner got the monster in him, but it is way too hammed up, just as all the other characters are. It might seem they're deliberately trying to be campy, and they are, but not in a good way.The villain is completely implausible. I won't identify him for sake of spoilers, but he makes no sense and is completely new and has nothing to do with the comics. Bad. And the fight scenes, while they show Hulk's strength, can be ridiculous. Hulk-dogs? Just seeing a green, mutant poodle made me want to vomit in my seat.However, there is a very nifty comic-book touch in how the movie's shot. Occasionally, multiple camera angles will be shown on screen at once, which gives a feel very like comic book panels. It's a really nice touch, and a very memorable thing that I hope more comic-book movies do, at least the campy ones.However, there's just not enough I can say to compliment this movie. There are nearly no Godzilla-esquire destruction scenes, which would make the movie well worth watching. The characters talk too much. It tries too hard to pull a Spider-Man by focusing more on Bruce Banner than the Hulk, but they failed to notice that the Hulk is interesting and Bruce Banner isn't. All in all, this movie is simply impossible to recommend to anybody who's ever read the comic. However, if you've never read a Hulk comic book before, you may be able to enjoy this. It's just sad this appeals to the opposite of its intended audience. 4/10",Hulk
702,MovieLegend,Gut-wrenching masterpiece. Too bad most people misunderstood it,8,4 June 2019,"2003 Hulk is exceptionally underrated in my opinion. Perhaps because people didn't get what they were expecting? The older one is more cerebral and insightful with lots of flashbacks to the past and more back story, whereas the 2008 version was more about let's get to it, smash up action and special effects... although I don't think the special effects were so bad in this one for 2003. The characters and acting are what make this movie great. Eric Bana, Nick Nolte, Jennifer Connelly, and Sam Elliott are all the best at the characters they play. I find myself now disappointed with the later incarnations. The 2003 version had deep, thoughtful characters, with appropriately developed motivations. The scenes particularly between Nolte and Bana near the end are gut wrenching and disturbing. With a current rating of only 5.6, I guess most people don't appreciate that. To a certain degree and especially now with superior CGI, I can understand somewhat why this movie hasn't held up. Parts of it come across as cartoonish and the split screen method showing multiple angles and viewpoints at once was unconventional... but hey, isn't this based off of comic books? In that regard, this movie holds up the most consistently with the Hulk's comic book roots. I'm willing to forgive some weaker special effects, especially since they were so unique... however the dog fight scene where Hulk protects Betty Ross and then the tussle near the end with Hulk smashing apart military tanks, tossing them miles away like rubbish, are still impressive to this day.",Hulk
703,tobisama,Great movie....,10,13 May 2005,"I guess Hulk was a great great movie, it was directed by an Asian director so thats the reason for the slow action in the first half of the movie.I m a fan of that kind of films I guess the people in America needs to learn how to watch that kind of movies, movies are not only fast action, fast jokes or fast jumps (thats the USA style), and every movie which is out of that stuff is rated a bad movie.THAT WAS EXACTLY THE VERSION OF HULK THAT I WAS WAITING..... By the way, the style reminds me the movie Unbreakeable (i like that movie too) Thats the reason of all the remakes of Asian movies (ring,grudge,dark water and the list keeps growing and even not only Asian movies, like the awesome movie from Spain ""Abre los Ojos"" with the US remake Vanilla Sky) 10/10 ..........you can say anything.......",Hulk

705,cheap_as_chipios,i wanted to rip my eyes out,3,30 January 2006,"The Hulk is just plain bad. it never engages it's audience like xmen or the old superman films, it takes itself far too seriously by going into the science of the thing- he's a big stupid green man it's not really science it's a comic book. Which mastermind contestant was trying to think of something really cool to attack the Hulk with and thought oh poodles are scary. Banners dad was a lame bad guy- several people walked out of the cinema during the showing and the rest of the audience spent the showing laughing at the poorness of the film (i kid you not), i only stayed because my lift home wasn't coming until the end.

706,alexis-muirhead,Hulk no smash...Hulk feel!,7,28 December 2005,"I'll begin with an admission: I've never read a single issue of the ""Hulk"" comics, or even many Marvel comics (I'm strictly a DC gal). As a result, this review comes from a non-fan, and as someone who didn't know anything about The Hulk when I walked into the theater, I walked out a fan of the character.This film is the antithesis of empty action spectaculars like ""Daredevil"", ""The Punisher"", ""Elecktra"" and ""Fantastic Four"". ""Hulk"" earns its action sequences by doing strong character work beforehand: the movie is, at its heart, a melodrama about the legacy of childhood trauma and abuse. Superheroes are at their best when they're working as metaphors for the human experience, and the Hulk, as the collection of Bruce Banner's rage and unhappy inheritance from his father, can be viewed (like King Kong, the Beast and a host of other characters framed as the embodiment of male rage and aggression) as male trauma writ large.As the big green menace, Eric Bana works hard to deliver a real performance amidst the CGI and sci-fi origins of the character. He's a little over-the-top sometimes, but as a guy who turns into a musclebound green monster whenever he gets mad or stressed out, Bana brings some desperately-needed believability to the role. The protagonist's relationship with Betty Ross is nicely complicated: rather than giving us a typical comic-book romance in which a new relationship blossoms only to complicate the hero's mission, the three (!) screenwriters deliver a complex, adult relationship which is formed by mutual suffering - both Betty and Bruce are their father's children, and that fact alone causes them much misery. Jennifer Connelly is wonderful in the film: her scenes are played for emotional truth, not the hysterics expected of women in the ""girlfriend role"". As a scientist, she's more fascinated than frightened by the Hulk and those mutant dogs who attack her SUV; even her screaming is subdued. Compare that to Kim Basigner in the 1989 ""Batman"" film and you can understand the relief the audience must feel to be offered a heroine who brings more to the table than just a pretty face and a great set of lungs.The villains of the film are, interestingly enough, often overshadowed by the Hulk himself, and the danger he poses to those around him, and to alter-ego Bruce Banner. Nick Nolte does a good job as the film's most visible antagonist (his performance seems inspired by that 1999 drunk driving charge and famous mugshot) and Josh Lucas (""Stealth"") chews the scenery as greedy corporate scientist. Sam Elliot plays General Ross as a man who doesn't give an inch: he has no qualms about killing the Hulk, even though it would also kill Bruce Banner. Seeing that kind of moral certitude in a military figure not played as incompetent or completely corrupt and sadistic is a refreshing change, one of many offered by this film.""Hulk"" may or may not be a faithful adaptation of the comic-book character; I neither know nor really care. I loved this film, and find it immensely rewatchable. For those who believe most superhero flicks to be dull excercises in wire fu and bad CGI, ""Hulk"" offers something new and different. You won't regret the price of admission.",Hulk
707,mckernanx32,Addressing many issues...,4,28 May 2008,"The idea of having a thinking mans comic book movie is a good one, and it should of worked. The problem with this attempt by Ang Lee is triple fold, though... First off, The extremely tragic and dramatic story line and direction just don't mesh well with the over the top comic book editing and (sometimes cheesy)""mood enhancing"" effects. i.e. the music and the lighting. Second, we have a very poor script that stretches too long, and looses all semblance of coherency in the last twenty minutes. The style and ideas were good, but the execution was very poor. The dramatic style could have fit perfectly with a by the numbers origins of the hulk storyline, and the dialog did not have be so cheesy. At times it felt very forced and unnatural. Third, The acting. I like every actor in this movie. The problem is, most of them had no place being in this movie. Eric Bana is good as a cardboard cutout type of character. This particular movie, though, required a little more. Connelly is a great actress, but seemed like she herself thought she was out of place as Betty Ross, and that threw her character for me. THe only actor i really felt fit well was Sam Niel, who plays his role perfectly, balancing the hard ass military man with the concerned father, and really bringing to life that struggle.Furthermore, i would have liked to see a more complete villain, with a more complete final fight. David Banner is just a weird amalgamation of different hulk villains, with no real coherency, and the battle of these super foes is very brief and literally just stops. There is no final blow, there is no epic battle, there is just ""ehhh...its over"" At the end of a comic book film, this is the make or break or point. Fans can accept a bad movie, if the final battle is worth the wait, but most viewers judge the entire movie on that final payoff, and if its not there, as it was not in this film, than we feel cheated.",Hulk

Of every person associated with this film, I must now say, as Queen Bavmorda said to her daughter, ""Now I must despise you!""Awful characterizations. Poor acting. Implausible action scenes. Consistantly inappropriate character tension. Phenominally bad lines throughout. nausiating (literally) and pointless camera effects.And it COULD have been GREAT!

710,DrWetter,What the heck was THAT????,4,22 June 2003,"I have to confess that my expectations were low for the Hulk, ever since seeing the television commercials aired since the superbowl. My expectations, however, were lowered even more with each minute that I watched the movie (and trust me, I felt each and every minute). This film is in DIRE need of editing. The best thing: Elfman's soundtrack. As always, in top form. The worst thing: everything else. The CGI, yes it was okay... but c'mon... make it INTERESTING!! I didn't care for one character. And Nick Nolte... especially at the end... what the hell was all THAT about???? The story would have been better had they left dear old dad out of the picture. We didn't need sappy or sugary sweet, but providing some sense of momentum would have been appreciated. This movie inspired me to do only one thing: rush home and watch Spider-Man on DVD. If there is a Hulk sequel (and I'm sure there will be), I hope that it will be more dynamic in both story and pacing.How I longed for the days of Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno.

711,Topsider,Not Incredible (get it? ha! I'm clever.),6,20 June 2003,"Why? why why why why why why why? At least Marvel's older, crappier movies (The Fantastic Four, Captain America, Punisher) were so bad they were fun to watch. With the Hulk, we get what we've come to expect from the horde of new digital headaches that include most of Marvel's new films (save X-Men 2) A.) Yet another Marvel opening credits sequence where the ""camera"" rushes through some sort of bloodstream, DNA thingy, Spider-Web, etc. (you know what I'm talking about) B.) A long, drawn out ""origin"" scene that weighs down the movie (every person on earth knows how Spider-Man, Hulk, X-Men, Daredevil, et. al were created!!!! You didn't see this kind of heavy handed exposition in Batman, the standard by which all comic movies should be judged). C.) Stan Lee Cameo. This time accompanied by Lou Ferrigno--which, by the way, some jackass guy involved with the new Hulk movie on some MTV special had the audacity to proclaim that ""with current special effects technology"" there's ""no more use"" for someone like Ferrigno. Well, guess again. The look of the Hulk in this movie is about as convincing as Rolling Stone magazine calling Christina Aguilera ""sexy."" That is to say, not very convincing. And speaking of Christina Aguilera, she is actually uglier than the new hulk, which is all cute and babyfaced looking. They call him a mindless monster in the movie, but then he's all about saving the iddle bitty soldiers inside the tanks he smashes up and looking sad about doing it. I'll wind this up. The film is way too long (OVER 2 hours), I don't know why they got Ang ""everything is weightless and unconvincing"" Lee to direct it, there is a Punisher teaser preview before the movie (""They killed my family, and I'm going to Punish them!"" Wow! Here we go again, true believers!) and ultimately no ""Hulk Smash!"" line which I anticipated for two hours with baited breath (or popcorny breath) to no avail. There are a few good scenes in Hulk, but not enough to merit seven bucks. Unless you're a lady, that is, in which you get to see Bana's bare ass. I was excited when Marvel started getting some movie success, but now they are just churning out run-of-the-mill, shiny blockbuster crap (Daredevil, the upcoming Punisher, you name it) like Hulk. At least the X-Men series is fantastic. I'm going to go now and enjoy my pot pie because I'm hungry. You wouldn't like me when I'm hungry. Hoo-boy! This movie still has a hold on me I guess!",Hulk
712,savas-3,Many excellent sequences make this worth renting,8,20 July 2004,"From the opening titles sequence, where we see a starfish's arm sliced off to illustrate regeneration (the starfish will regrow the missing limb plus the arm will grow into a whole new starfish), I knew this adaptation was being played very serious. Trust Ang Lee to turn a typical comic book story into some serious philosophy of the good and evil that lurks in all of us...and add to that the eternal conflicts between fathers and sons.That being said, this isn't the movie I would have made. There are too many minor nitpicks in the story that could easily have been fixed. First, I would have preferred a more realistic and less comic book rendition of the Hulk. Just as most musicals destroy any illusion of reality when everyone simultaneously bursts into song, this film's CGI is way too reminiscent of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" for my taste. Second, the film's time frame should have been placed further into the future so that the pivotal genetic science aspects would more accurately parallel reality. Finally, it was plausible on the TV show for Lou Ferrigno to still be wearing tattered trousers after the transformation since he was maybe about 6 inches taller than Bruce Banner. It isn't plausible if the Hulk is King Kong's size, as Ang Lee has decided to portray him.Everything else about this film though is topnotch...you can see every cent of the $120 million+ they spent making this, right up on the screen. If you don't go into this with too high of expectations you will likely not be disappointed.",Hulk
713,brianh2006,You'll actually like him when he's angry.,8,20 June 2003,"When I first heard they were doing a live action version of The Hulk, I wasn't all that excited. I'd never really even liked the Hulk and didn't know much about him, mostly staying staying with more popular characters such as Batman and Spider-man. But after seeing the movie I have to say, this is a good movie for anyone, whether they be an avid Hulk fan or someone who's never even heard of it and just wandered into the wrong theater. The movie stays true to the comics (mostly) and the movie is actually done like a comic with a unique form of editing. Eric Bana is great as Bruce Banner, though when he changes into the Hulk (and CGI takes over) you can't even tell it's the same person. Jennifer Connelly is also good as Betty Ross, but Nick Nolte does a great job as David Banner, Bruce's father, delivering a...somewhat long speech, and adding humor by making fun of one of Bruce's ""tantrums."" Also, the cameo by Stan Lee (creater of The Hulk) and Lou Ferrigno (played the Hulk on the original TV series) is great. All in all, this is a fun movie that stays true to the comics and gives everyone something to relate to (the anger we bottle up, you know you do.)",Hulk
714,brownranger-53883,It was a great adaptation,8,7 February 2020,I enjoyed the film Eric Bana as Bruce Banner great choice and whoever played the hulk did good as well and the animation of the clothes ripping off(inculding the pants)was great it almost looked like it was real. And to be honest I wish I was the Hulk,Hulk
715,jbanet,The Hulk tries too hard,5,23 June 2003,"I went to this movie expecting the raw emotion of the hulk to really pull the audience in, to make us feel for him, to make us get angry along with him. What I got was a lot of characters yelling, crying, and trying very hard to appear emotional, but coming off forced and unconvincing. The bonds between the characters, and more importantly the bonds between the characters and the audience, were not developed well enough to ever make these emotional outbursts very motivating. Perhaps it would have helped if the beginning of the movie had focused less on just telling us the back story and more on building the characters in the present, letting the audience become clued in to their history as the movie progressed.The action scenes suffer from a similar problem. Some were good, but for the most part, they were uninteresting despite the over-the-top action. It seems that the creators were unable to make the action more subtly interesting, so they just made it bigger and wilder. Unfortunately, boring action made bigger is still boring action.The comic style scene cuts were interesting but overdone. Not every scene needs a fancy cut. Eventually the strange cuts just became repetitive. It looked more like someone playing with new audio-video equipment than someone seriously making a movie. They should have focused on making excellent comic style cuts at key scenes instead of making mediocre attempts at it throughout the whole movie.All in all, ""The Hulk"" is not a bad movie. It is, however, a movie that lacks subtlety and tries too hard to make up for it with quantity and extremity.",Hulk

718,dylgates,An noble failure,6,16 July 2006,"Remember this movie getting pretty bad reviews but wanted to see it due to the good cast and a great director. It's no classic but Ang Lee obviously tried to do something different with this film. It works on many levels; the acting's decent (in particular the actor playing General Ross manages to subtly convey the divided loyalties of a military man who realises that he will hurt his beloved daughter), the special effects, though occasionally ridiculous, are solid, and there is an obvious attempt to develop the characters.On the other hand, it is way too long and the plot is far too convoluted. Ang Lee deviated too far from the source material by making David Banner (Bruce's father) a key figure. While this may have worked with a bit more restraint, the final scenes were too over the top for a film which started off so slowly.Overall all, worth seeing if you've got a couple of hours to spare and want to see a reasonably intelligent and (ending notwithstanding) restrained blockbuster.",Hulk
719,acejm2001,"Not Great, Not Bad",1,19 June 2003,"First off, I will admit I am not a big comic book fan. With that said, I cannot say the Hulk was a bad movie because it simply was not. However, the movie just simply failed at getting me ""involved"" into the plot. I walked out feeling pretty much the same way as when I walked in. I just had no feeling toward any of the characters. Great effects during the action sequences, although I did not like the way they designed the actual ""Hulk."" If you are a fan of the genre, then of course, it is a must see. However, for the rest of movie fans, it may just simply be another movie.",Hulk
720,t3646p,Very well done,9,24 June 2003,"I didn't have too many preconceptions going into this movie except hoping the story would be good and that the actors would have natural and flowing delivery of decent dialogue. Some of my favorite TV shows and movies of the past had extremely cheap FX (remember Doctor Who) but still kept you glued to the screen seeing what would happen next because of interesting characters and good story. I think this movie delivered very well in all aspects of what I mentioned above and also in some extremely well done action sequences. I was very impressed with the look of the hulk fighting in the bright daylight (perhaps even more so than his night battles). The use of split panels and crossfading scenes was fantastic and really helped the movie flow.
Being an adult I enjoyed the serious setup at the beginning and that the tone stayed throughout. I didn't feel any drastic change in tone when the Hulk first appears and I think they did a great job with Sam Elliot's character by not turning him into a cigar chomping, fascist ""destroy at all costs"" military freak. He comes across as a soldier doing his job to protect the public and a father trying to regain a connection with his daughter. All the characters were very three dimensional.People can complain and nit pick all day long on CGI details but after seeing huge disappointments like Matrix Reloaded and to a much lesser extent X2, excellent CGI does not a great movie make. Characters and story do. If a steady diet of MTV style editing and Calvin Klein shots of beautiful people has become substance for up and coming movie watchers today it's not a surprise that anytime you have people actually spending time talking to each other in real language as opposed to catch phrases and tag lines, the camera doesn't jolt around through 10 different angles, they're bored and think nothing's happening.Well done Ang Lee....I hope you don't rush back to small independent character studies anytime soon as you really know how to humanize big action spectacles...P.S I thought the CGI in the HULK was seriously kick ass anyway (Ok, the dogs looked a little like they were injected with helium, but the energy in that scene rocked)",Hulk

Perhaps the more impatient would find some parts slow, but I found the focus on character, with patience in developing sympathy for them to be appropriate, and refreshing.

725,MrBlondNYC,Ang Lee made me Angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.,6,3 December 2005,"I don't remember Bruce Banner being the son of Charles Manson in the comic book. Jeez, Nick Nolte! Any emotions I was supposed to feel with their relationship was lost with Nolte's scenery chewing. I bet he still has pieces of blue screen stuck in his teeth. I have the same kind of troubled relationship with my father and I felt nothing during those scenes except embarrassment for the actors. Not only were these scenes embarrassing but also unnecessary since they weren't based on the comic.The fact of the matter is, in a comic book movie there just has to be a great villain. It's the villain that really makes these kinds of films. The best superhero films or just action films in general always have a strong actor playing the villain. Josh Lucas is a decent actor but not very striking and his character might as well have had a black hat and handlebar mustache. But wait...Bruce Banner's biggest enemy is himself, right? Right. But we really didn't need that explained to us for 2 and 1/2 hours! And the final chase, while it was supposed to be beautifully poetic in the Ang Lee style, with Hulk jumping across the Southwest, ended up looking ridiculous and being nonsensical and boring. I don't remember him having the ability to do that in the comic and there's not much fun in watching a solitary figure fly through the desert. This scene might not have been longer than five minutes. But it seemed like an eternity. Why not have Hulk jump to the Vegas Strip while you are it? At least that would have been visually stimulating.On the plus side, the acting by Eric Bana, Jennnifer Connelly and Sam Elliott was excellent. Especially, Connelly making a mountain out of a molehill of an underwritten role. She really showed the pain of loving someone who is emotionally unavailable (both her father and Bruce). Bana is actually very fortunate that this movie failed because it has freed him to take on a variety of interesting roles without being typecast or contractually obligated. Welcome to Hollywood, mate. Please stay! Ang Lee is a fantastic director. But he was the wrong man for the job. No, he didn't write the script. But his writer James Schamus added a ton of his usual flourishes to the hacky script by John Turman and Michael France, leaving the viewer with two different movies HULK SMASHED together. The comic book panel scenes were a nice touch by Lee and he made the film visually interesting overall. But a different director could have taken the script and made something exciting out of it. (Look at the other films Michael France has written for example) So ""Hulk"", even with the pedestrian script and weak villain, could have been a lean, mean summer popcorn flick and a perfect set-up for sequels under someone else. Too bad. My rating 6/10.",Hulk
726,seawasp,"A very creditable job with a very, very difficult subject.",8,20 July 2003,"Doing comic-book characters on the live screen is extremely difficult. The number of failures far outweighs some of the recent triumphs (Spider-Man, X- Men).Virtually all of them require some kind of tweak -- sometimes a large one -- to make them work for a modern live-action audience. Spider-man's origin was slightly modified, and his powers tweaked. The X-men's uniforms had to be changed, and origins modified.***THERE MAY BE SPOILERS HERE. Read at your own risk***The Hulk may be one of the hardest to do well. His origin was, itself, so very 1950s - 60s that later adaptations have all evaded using it; we know that being exposed to bomb radiation just kills things, and the WSOD (Willing Suspension of Disbelief) doesn't need any extra strains on it when you're trying to deal with a comicbook character brought to life.  The TV show with Bixby and Ferrigno tried to create a more live-action-friendly version by seriously weakening the Hulk's powers and making them more akin to some kind of overdriven adrenaline surge.  This worked to some extent, but one of the most common problems Hulk fans would mention is ""It's not a bad show, but that's just not the Hulk"".For the movie, Ang Lee decided to go for the ""real Hulk"" in terms of power, looks, and so on. This required thinking out an origin which would allow sufficient handwaving to make it work. In my view, they succeeded amazingly well; the origin makes sense, within the comic-book world context. Nanotech combined with gamma radiation and genetic manipulation -- this at least gives us enough bizarre combinatorial possibilities that we can sit back and watch what happens.The interplay of characters in the Hulk series has always been a major issue as well. The simple fact is that the story of the Hulk is very much a takeoff on Jekyll and Hyde, on control versus uncontrolled passions, and on prejudice, fear, and hubris. Ang Lee, fortunately, seems to have understood this and tries -- mostly successfully -- to give us delineated, flawed, yet mostly understandable people. The only ones without any sympathetic aspects are one rather stupid, grasping corporate exec, and Banner's father -- who one first might give the benefit of the doubt, but who soon after proves to be as dangerously insane as anyone ever put on film.The action sequences are amazingly well done; the Hulk effects do not work on the small screen, and so the advertisements make the Hulk look very unreal. He looks MUCH better on the big screen, and the sequences involving him are very impressive indeed.Another point for the Hulk has always been to make him LOOK like a hideously dangerous rampaging monster (to justify the weight of metal thrown at him) while allowing the viewers/readers to see that he is not, truly, a villain. This has been pretty much a constant through the comics, the TV shows, and is kept here; even while being attacked, the Hulk tries not to kill any human being, but in ways that are subtle enough that only the viewer can be SURE of what they're seeing.Overall, this is an excellent movie of its kind. I highly recommend it. I went in expecting to be disappointed, and came out very pleased indeed with the result.",Hulk
727,jcon526,Highly worthwhile action/sci-fi movie,9,24 June 2003,"The Hulk was definitely a phenomenal movie that was worth seeing. Although it's a comic-book movie through and through, it was undoubtedly a character-driven movie, as the character development made for a long setup (I definitely wanted the action to kick in quickly, but I had to be patient, which is some ways was a good thing).  When the Hulk did manifest, it was explosive, especially in the drawn-out build-up of Bruce Banner's (Eric Bana) bottled-up emotions.  In the very least, the actor did very well in spilling out Banner's long-suppressed temper.  Some of the sci-fi was over the top, but this was definitely not a pervasive trait of the movie.  Well-done comic-book movie.  9/ 10",Hulk
728,pacree,A pleasant surprise,7,22 June 2003,"After the laughable trailers I was worried that Ang Lee had made Tim Burton's mistake of not taking his subject with the respect it deserved. I was worried for nothing.  Mr. Lee treated this subject as it needed to be treated; not as a comic book but as a monster movie in the tradition of Jekyll and Hyde and King Kong.  There are allusions to comic book style, of course (the comic-frame edits got very annoying), but over-all the subject and the characters were treated with dignity.  Above all, Mr. Lee resisted the temptation to make the monster appear ""cool.""  Instead, the rampaging beast was treated as it should be; the manifestation of the rage felt by an unfortunate young man caught between two powerful, obsessive men. Banner's father seeks to literally consume the offspring he envies; the general sees only a threat to his estranged daughter and wishes to destroy that threat. Bruce Banner, a victim never in control of his own destiny, succumbs to the terrible temptation to free himself from both of them  as only a man who's emotional development was arrested at age 4 could; by lashing out.  Bruce Banner's relationship with Betty Ross has been compared to a very similar role also played by Jennifer Connelly in A Beautiful Mind; basically as a loyal, highly intelligent and loving partner.  There are other lesser elements which distract somewhat and keep the film from being a total success, which is why I voted a 7.  Overall, it was worth my $7.25.",Hulk

That movie was out 20 years ago already, we've all seen it, no need to rehash. Likewise, there was not need to pile up melodrama about Fathers and Sons, that book came out a century and a half ago, we've all read the Cliff's notes when we had to pass World Lit in our sophomore year of college, no need to rehash.Loved the comic-book style transitions.

We got so much pleasure out of excellent comic book movies like X-Men, Spider-Man and Daredevil we had to be punished. And who better to give us our punishment than Ang Lee, the worst (and most overrated) director in Hollywood who directed the lacklustre Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the snoozefest The Ice Storm. He has completely messed the good reputation Marvel movies have been making for themselves. The film has so many problems I don't know where to begin.First has to be the script. I'll admit it's nice to see that writers are trying to add intelligence to action movies but the writers here have completely forgotten that it needs to make sense as well. They try to make things like being injected with serum and being hit with a bomb (was no one suspicous as to why Bruce Banner didn't just die) a common thing. Plus the bizarre ending just goes completely out of control and just ends up being confusing. And the dialogue could not be more flat. Oh, and the attempts of drama they have put in are embarrassing.Then there's the casting. Eric Bana is awful in the lead role. He makes the character dull and humourless so it's impossible to sympathise with him. He also looks more constipated when he starts to 'Hulk' up. Equally awful is Sam Elliot who has no fun as the General and just seems bored. Jennifer Connelly makes a stupid move to follow up her deserved Oscar winning role in A Beautiful Mind with a character that shows off none of her talent. She tries her best the role is just flat. Nick Nolte fairs a bit better but only puts in half the effort as Banner's father. Only a times going nuts he, like Elliot, seems bored most of the time. In fact the movie is stolen from the least likely of sources and that is Josh Lucas as a smarmy villain who is underused but at least seems to be enjoying himself. Plus the little chemistry Bana and Connelly have is wasted on boring and tepid romantic scenes.But the main problem is Director Lee. He can't pace a film to save his life so the film feels very, very, very, very, very, very slow. It takes three quarters of an hour before anything happens. Also he tries to make the film arty by using devices like split screen. Art and Hulk. Doesn't really go together, does it Ang? He is also void of any sense of humour and takes the film way too seriously. No comic book references and no one liners. The mildly funny ('You found me.' 'You not that hard to find.') is crippled by sentiment when Bana says 'Yes I was'. Get your bucket out!!!Any other director could have made this a fast paced action movie that gets you on the edge of your seat but Lee makes the film an hour too long and only fills about 50 minutes of his 138 minute running time with what we came to see. The Hulk!!!!!And what about the Hulk himself? Well, the CG Hulk is as good as you may expect as are the special effects but they're nothing impressive really.
In fact the only saving grace of this film is half an hour of solid action when the hulk goes out of control and starts smashing everything in sight but it's hard to appreciate it when thats what we paid for in the first place instead of this dull, fun-free, miscast rubbish. No sequel please. 2/10.",Hulk
731,IlustreBOB,CGI are wonderful!! People need to review their own concepts.,7,27 June 2003,"I wonder why people keep complaining about the CGI in the movie, as if the special effects were the main character of the movie. It is NOT. Bruce Banner's wicked mind is.Moreover, IF CGI was the main character of the movie that wouldn't became a problem at all... ** CGI in ""Hulk"" is absolutely fantastic!! ** I just don't understand why people say it sucks. It's as good as Episode II's Yoda or The Two Towers' Gollum.What did you expect from a 50 feet green monster jumping between cities? Realism? C'mon. People are mixing things up. Hulk would never look really REAL, since he has an humanoid form and we are all inclined to compare humanoid forms with the real humans we know. So, the problem isn't in the CGI but in our mind and comparisons patterns. We compare a giant emerald hulk with us, human beings; not how well the CGI was made.That's exactly why most people think that Jurassic Park's CGI are still the best ever seen and Scooby Doo's are the worst! We have dogs in our houses to compare with Scooby, but we don't have velociraptors as pets. That's why they look so cool. I bet if we had raptors in backyards people would be saying that those from Jurassic Park looks fake...",Hulk
732,WeezerRob,"The horror, the horror",3,21 June 2003,"You wanna talk about one sad comic book fan, I am him. ""The Hulk"" was the biggest let down of the summer, if not the biggest let down in comic book to movie history. It was so bad that I would have rather watched all four Batman movies in one sitting. The storyline is so bland that you have no real concern for any of the characters. The special effects were pretty good but they only utilized them for one or two good action sequences. Can I ask where the storyline from the comic was? In fact, the only good thing this movie had going for it was the cameo by Stan Lee and Lou Ferigno. In closing, I would like to give you some alternative Summer comic options to do instead of throwing your money away on ""The Hulk"": go see X-men 2 again, save your money for ""The League of extraordinary Gentlemen,"" buy ""Daredevil"" on DVD it should be out soon (which I didn't see but I'm sure it was better than Hulk), or just do things the old fashioned way and go out and buy yourself a good graphic novel in trade paperback at your local comic or book shop. (I recommend preacher, it's great and they're working on the movie.)",Hulk
733,baddog66,Could've been better,1,23 June 2003,"Why is it that a production company will sink millions of dollars into a film and then overlook the little things to allow a movie to fall far short of its potential.I was eagerly awaiting The Hulk, but I was very disappointed.  While Ang Lee had directed decent films like Sense and Sensibility and Crouching Tiger, I have a hard time believing this is the same guy directing the Hulk.  I have 3 general complaints about the film:1) The constant and way-too-frequent split-screen panels are incredibly distracting to the story.  Anyone who has studied film knows that effects like split screen are cool once but annoying if you use them every 5 minutes.2) The story took way too long to develop.  This is the same problem Pearl Harbor had.  There is no reason to wait 40-45 minutes to get anything to happen in this type of film.  I am pretty sure their target market for this film is kids, teens and/or early 20's, but there were kids talking in the theater after about 20 minutes.  You think that they would have test screened the film and noticed that the movie is boring... EVEN FOR KIDS!3) The acting wasn't very good.  Nick Nolte, Sam Elliott and Jennifer Connely have all had better gigs.  This goes back to the directing problem. The film didn't make me really care one way or the other about Bruce Banner or the films ""plot"".  More importantly, why didn't they cast someone who could act to be Bruce Banner.  I've seen Eric Bana in other things but he never seems natural.  He always seems like an actor trying to act a scene rather than a character in the film.The film had one redeeming quality: the CGI Hulk was very good.
I am not against films in this genre.  I loved X1, X2, and Spiderman.  In this case, the Hulk is a film I wish I had waited to see after the DVD was released.  I feel cheated that I paid 8 bucks a pop to see this half assed movie.",Hulk
734,Max_Colston,"Some of it worked, some of it didn't.",7,13 July 2003,"Definitely the comic book adaptation you don't want to take your little ones to. Both because it's on the boring side and because it's really dark. Ang Lee, the director of such great films like `The Ice Storm' and `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', has done something that no comic book film (or any film) has done in a while: take its time by developing the characters and actually making us care for them. I'm not saying it was the greatest move, but I was glad Ang did it.`Hulk' is just the latest comic book to be made into a movie, following in the tracks of `X-Men', `Spider-Man', `Daredevil', and the upcoming `League of Extraordinary Gentleman'. It's not my favorite of the comic book film, nor is it my least favorite. Some of it worked, some of it didn't.The film focuses on a scientist named Bruce Banner. Before he was born, his father (Nick Nolte), who was also a scientist, tested on himself and passed his mutated genes onto Bruce. Now, Bruce, thirty-five, and his research partner Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) are performing experiments on animals with something called 'gamma rays'. The gamma rays are supposed to help heal wounds and other injuries. But it doesn't work. Once exposed to the gamma, the animals explode. Well, one day, Bruce is accidentally exposed to a dose of gamma rays. He should be dead, but he's just fine. Pretty soon he figures out that he can turn into a muscular 10-foot-tall monster. Kind of like me when I see Jennifer Connelly.Not my favorite comic-to-film movie. That award belongs to 1989's `Batman'. But it did remind me of `Batman' and `Superman'. Not since those films have I seen such a character-driven comic book adaptation. But it doesn't pull it off magnificently. Within the first 45 minutes, I was about to fall asleep. Well, not exactly fall asleep, but it wasn't turning out how I wanted it to. But once he (finally) turns into the Hulk, I was wide awake! Especially during that scene where he beat the living hell out of those Hulk Dogs that were exactly the same size as him. Good Stuff! I also personally enjoyed the scene where Hulk holds on to a jet as it tries to lose him by gliding up right into space. I don't mean to sound weird, but as the sound grew more quite and the further up they went into space, I found myself losing my breath. A film's never done that to me before!But between these uber action scenes, there lies the long boring patches of talking. Not that I don't like long conversations, but I found it unnecessary to have so many of them in an action movie. I was so disappointed as the film started to get really good, but started another long boring patch. What I also didn't like was how the Hulk looked. There were a couple parts in the film where it looked so fake.....I laughed.The acting in the film is strong. Eric Bana does pretty good as the mad, but charming scientist. And Jennifer Connelly does very well as the hard-to-get friend. Man, she is beautiful! I thought Josh Lucas did an awesome job as the enemy. With his smoldering good looks, smart ass voice, and con artist moves, he pulled it off magnificently. But I think the stand-out performance is Nick Nolte. People have been crapping all over this character, calling it an unnecessary subplot. But I uberly disagree! I enjoyed it as he used his rough voice, scary eyes, and his mug shot-looking haircut to the fullest!I appreciate what Ang did with the film. I think he just to comic book films to the next level. But, hey, buddy, you really could have laid off all the drama. You could have cut the film down from its 2 hour and 20 minute running time to a cool 1 hour and 50 minutes. I don't think we would have missed anything.An over `okay' comic book picture. Although it doesn't match up against this year's earlier comic book films, it still deserves a look.Grade: B",Hulk
735,albinus01,Should have stuck with the source material,2,23 July 2010,"This film is a terrible and boring adaptation of a beloved Marvel comics icon and a terrible and boring movie on its own. This is yet another example of what happens when Hollywood thinks they know best. The Hulk is popular for a reason. People like the character from the COMICS. The story was there, along with a built in fan base. Why not use it. ""HULK SMASH"" was really all they needed. They unfortunately went with the ridiculous idea that a stronger Hulk means a bigger and faster Hulk. Cause as we all know that Lou Ferrigno was well known as an Olympic runner. Add in some terrible CGI and some giant mutant poodles and we have a success right? WRONG. This movie is only for a great example of how to not make a simple comic to movie adaptation.The origins of Hulk drug on and on, it was soooo boring. NOT a good way to start any movie. All they had to do was have a quick flashback of the gamma bomb test accident, then lead directly into Banner evading the military and police, being spotted and then turn into the Hulk.

The Hulk is strongly character driven. Bruce Banner doesn't even transform into 'The Hulk' for the first 45 minutes. Once the action begins though, it comes hard and fast and very very cool. I was beginning to wonder if I had wasted 8 dollars until the first major fight scene began. From there, the movie goes from one jaw dropping action sequence to the next (with small breaks to develop the story, of course).  Ang Lee's use of split screening to give a comic book feel was 'cool', but distracting. I was impressed by what it must have taken to do it, yet it jarred me out of the story by reminding me I was watching a movie.The Hulk's story line is dark and sometimes a little scary (too scary for young children).Another high budget super hero film, not the best but not the worst either.7/10",Hulk
737,lordkinboat-1,A thinking persons movie that delivers.,8,21 June 2003,"Going into the Hulk I wasn't expecting much. But much to my surprise this movie delivered. It is a thinking person's movie, the plot is carefully crafted, not only through dialogue but though imagery. Paying attention is important, even in the starting credits, as the story development is quick and deft. This movie is very dark and I would not think that kids or the action junky would appreciate it for what it is. Also it has some scenes that were emotionally strong and violent, but may come across as scary and disturbing to the little ones. Therefore PG13 may be a little lax on the Hulk.I never felt that the action or acting were completely over the top. I have found myself saying,"" Oh Brother"" in many movies lately, but not with the Hulk. Near the end of the film, I did feel it was getting overly serious, but with his excellent craft, Nolte brought the story back to it fanciful theme. Nolte was brilliant in his role as David Banner and while this movie my not be the vessel for an Oscar, Nolte's acting bares resemblance to Oscar performances.So well directed, written, and acted, that the green man could have been Gumby and I still would have enjoyed it.

742,gavin-evans,Another blockbuster disappoints,1,12 July 2003,"A year on from the awful mess that was Spiderman, a new 'superhero' is transformed onto our screens with a big budget, CGI and a quality director. Everyones been talking about it and I was ready to see a decent film with some wicked computer effects. As the films not out in the UK till next friday (I saw an advance screening), I was looking forward to one of the biggest summer blockbusters of the year, and all I got in return was a numb bum. 2 hours and 15 minutes later, I walked out of the cinema without any good things to say about the film. The effects are dodgy to say the least, the Hulk's only in the film for about 15 minutes. The action sequences are dark, dis-jointed, poorly edited and as for the finale, well only Ang Lee knows what is going on!! Bana does a good job in a difficult role, Nick Nolte looks like he enjoyed himself but the other members of the cast are stale. The comic book style editing is a gimmic and it often leaves you wondering what Ang Lee is trying to tell us. Ok, the Hulk is massive and can probably kick some ass but he's never really given a chance. There's no 'baddy' as such so the story seems one sided and the running time is criminal. This film should of been a 100 minute, adrenalin rush instead I needed to be kicked every now and again so that I stayed awake! The story is dragged out and the first 45 minutes are empty. Although, the credit sequence at the start of the film is inventive, it doesnt give enough detail about the genetic engineering that provides the underlying core of the film. So, another year, another 'superhero' and another major dissapointment for the blockbuster hungry crowd. You can normally tell if a films any good by the reaction at the end of the film, everyone walked out in silence and went home! Nothing to say about a nothing film.",Hulk

A little mellow dramatic and maybe it drifted a little from the original story it still fulfilled and far exceeded my expectations of the movie. With great acting and even greater CGI/special effects the fact that more people didn't love this movie is a complete mystery.  Ang Lee has really out did himself this time and has became the first director who was able to not only capture the complete essence of the character but he was also able to capture the essence of a comic book. A sequel is being hoped for and going to be long awaited.  It is easily the best movie I have seen this year. Matrix Reloaded and X2 can move over and take there place as the lack luster sequels they were.  Easily the best special effects I have ever seen in a movie.

Having Nick Nolte touch the Hulk was a nice touch. The hair and water effects were impressive.  This movie was far more entertaining than that 28 days later..but that isn't saying much now, is it.C'mon, give it its due.  Its a comicbook brought to life, and it was entertaining in the end. The characters were way more believable than Daredevil.  Overall, not as good as X-men, and almost on par with Spidey. The action scenes really rocked!

The animated-Hulk took a bit of getting used to on the trailers, but in the movie, the viewer gets gradually adjusted to the transformation.  Also, Lee does a good job of playing up the ""kitschy"" comic-book feel of the movie, so you feel like you are watching a liquid version of a paper comic book. Quite interesting, actually.

Instead of a scientist whose ego results in an accident that creates The Hulk, Bruce Banner is now the complete result of his father's actions!  He is, to put it simply, a nothing.  The film itself takes forever to get started; comes to life for about forty minutes when the pretty funny looking--but still fun--Hulk begins to smash things, although the ""Hulk dogs"" are the worst idea imaginable; and then totally spirals out of control with the most ludicrous and non-sensical ending of any film this summer.

This film manages to genuinely portray vulnerability using a story that is typical comic book genetically-mutated-being material where other similar films offer style but not substance. Okay, the ending throws the film a little off-kilter, but I can forgive it that. I think people's expectations of this film were mislead or misinformed before seeing it - it is not the average, run-of-the-mill, campy old superhero film. It has depth, and to achieve that it requires to be a little more of a cerebral approach to it. I'm not saying it's on the same level as an Aronofsky or a Polanski film - it's a blockbuster after all - but as such it's unfortunately not everyone's cup of tea when all they want to do it mong out in front of big explosions for an hour and a half.",Hulk

Most of the time Eric Bana was on-screen, hilarity ensued... but not because it was a comedy. Was Nick Nolte's character even given a name? It was doomed from the beginning. There haven't been any that were even passable as a good movie. The writers (Schamus, Turman, and France) didn't seem to have even picked up any of the comic books in their research.

Contrary to the opinions of many self-proclaimed critics, Eric Bana gave an excellent performance as Bruce Banner, his co- star Jennifer Connolly was equally wonderful as Betty Ross. The supporting cast that follows them was very well assigned, such names as Sam Elliot, Josh Lucas and Nick Nolte. Ang Lee's direction gave this comic book film a unique touch that I haven't seen in other such films. His use of multiple shots appearing at once (reminiscent of the TV series 24) proved to be an interesting instrument to grab your attention, and beyond that the general fit and finish of the film came across as top notch. David Elfman's score was enchanting and thrilling to add to the characteristics of the film itself. Overall, I don't have much to say other than the direction this film had and the actors who were in it were all very excellent. This film wasn't made to be a masterpiece of the same caliber of works done by Steven Spielburg, nor should it be expected as such.

The movie started off slow and continued slow for at least an hour, then we got about 15-20 min of pretty interesting action and then back to slow useless dialogue again.

Well my son fell asleep 30 min into this film which pretty much tells you what the attention level of this film is. ""It was not interesting at all"" my son said. All he could think about during the film was ""When is this going to end"". The only part I did enjoy was when The Hulk was throwing tanks around and kicking some military butt, which is the only reason i gave this film a 2/10. The ending was horrible, seems like they ran out of story and just made it up at the last minute to rush this piece of junk out to the theaters. Bottom line is, this movie is not entertaining, it does not keep you excited or on the edge of your seat. If you like movies with lots of dialogue then perhaps this film is for you but I believe that Comic Book films are meant to be entertaining, thrilling, and exciting. This film definitely was not.",Hulk
760,Rosebud2000,An interesting adaptation,7,7 December 2005,"Hulk is not like your usual comic book adaptation. It's a movie directed by Ang Lee, which means it's a movie based on a comic, but it's the work of a director who will try to find something different, in the material, from your normal genre movie. And he does find it. Hulk is a variation of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.Hyde, the story of a meek, controlled man, Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) who is victim of not one, but two experiments that go wrong (one that happened before he was even conceived, thanks to his father's obsession, and one that happens to him as he's working on a genetic research in a university facility), and witnesses a transformation in himself. When the rage and anger in a situation becomes too strong, a primal force is unleashed in him, something powerful and primordial. He turns into a giant creature, wild and with a strength that's almost infinite. Hulk. One of the good things of the movie, is that Hulk is not good or bad. It has no real moral connotations. It's in a way nature, the wilderness, the roots of man. But it is still Bruce Banner, in a way, in love with a fellow scientist, Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). Hulk of course attracts the attention of the military, who wants to study it, see if it is fit to be used as a weapon, and if not destroy it. One of the very interesting things in Hulk, and something that separates him from other movies of the same genre, is that there are no real bad guys, until the third act, and when the villains do appear and reveal themselves, in the story as such, well they got pretty complex motivation. General Ross (Sam Elliott), Betty's father, who takes charge of the military operations regarding Hulk, is not seen as a bad guy. he's also a pretty complex character. He knows more of the story than he lets on to his daughter, but he's someone who's trying to deal sincerely at the best of his abilities, and within his limits and flaws, with an extreme situation. There are beautiful things in Hulk (like Ang Lee's use of the split screen in the beginning, which is totally at the service of the actors), but also things that don't work. One of them, and a pretty big one, is the creature himself. It's a total CGI work, it looks like it, and it's hard to buy him as a true being, made of flesh and bones. You accept it, but you're not convince by it. But, if even with this special effects limitations, Hulk remains an interesting, fascinating movie, and it does, well that's just further proof that this unusual big budget comic book film has really something good going on in its core.",Hulk

I even liked the CGI...but the plot left a lot to be desired.  It takes 40 minutes into the movie before the green one arrives. Another half-hour before a decent action scene takes place.  Too much brooding and under-acting by the two main characters can bore the crap out of you before you get to the payoff of the Hulk running wild. It is also a superhero movie without a villian.  If this was Batman, there is no Joker.  If this was Spiderman, there is no Green Goblin.  There is nobody to root against.  You cannot blame the people that are after Hulk...you would be too.

Big strong guys are boring characters. The movie dragged on for what seemed like forever, and was indeed well over 2 hours. This was entirely unnecessary. Instead of being cryptic and keeping the audience in the dark for the first 90 minutes, how about you just get to the friggin point! The comic book-esque directing, having multiple frames zooming around the screen was, I think, a desperate attempt by Ang Lee to distract the viewers from how bad the movie was, and it was just really annoying. And the ending? What the heck was that? So Bruce's father just flips out and turns into some kind of giant energy cloud and fights his son to the death? Riiiiight. This follows the story in so many bad movies where the ending just puts the nail in the coffin and you know you've just witnessed a total piece of trash. Very boo, Stan Lee.

Now I generally like comic book movies, even the not so good ones. But as an action film, this one is dead. We begin with Betty and Bruce having already broken up because of his lack of emotion, and that fault is carried throughout the movie. There is no connection between the two lead characters. But here, the Hulk kills needlessly. After bringing down a helicopter, he smashes his giant fist through the cockpit to make certain the crew dies. Is this a hero? His actions throughout the movie make him seem selfish. He's just mad all the time. The first ending is confusing, and says sequel, but the second ending is only tagged on, and SCREAMS sequel.

771,sado196,Trying too hard...,6,23 June 2003,"Ang Lee falls short on his attempt to bring high art filmmaking to low art comics.  In a genre that is full of formula, he tried delivering something different.  Too bad he fumbled it.Don't get me wrong.  The movie is good.  That is if you resign yourself to the fact that for the first 45 minutes you will be beaten over the head with the same facts about the characters' past again and again till you want to turn green and smash things yourself.  You will be slowly fed some mystery about Bruce's past that ends up being unimportant (and easily guessed). You will not see green skin that entire 45 minutes either.  Just overblown exposition on a back-story you'll forget (or at least want to).Once things speed up, you'll see some amazing eye candy of a more subtle nature than most Marvel movies.  The desert scenes are incredible and frame the action perfectly.  The movement and expressions of the Hulk makes up for his somewhat comical rendering.  And the actors themselves do a very good job.  My personal favorite was Sam Elliot as General Ross.  And Jennifer Connelly was as bewitching as always, and is easily believable in the roll of the beautiful scientist girlfriend.Ang Lee fails to combine all the ingredients in the end; perhaps because he's better as a different kind of chef.  More than likely it's because he was trying to prove that he could bring the Hulk out of the comic book genre and into the world of deep drama.  Hey Mr. Lee... it wasn't the mothers and art house film students wearing the t-shirts that said ""HULK"" on them.  It was the kids, comic book dorks and the rest of us who grew up on fantastic stories like the Hulk, and just want to be entertained.

Unless you can watch a movie solely for its special effects, you'll be disappointed.  The plot was uninspired, inconsistent and often making little sense (especially later on).  Though there were some decent actors, cheesy lines made many scenes hard to watch.  Throughout strange transitions and split screens were used, presumably in an attempt to capture the feel of a comic, but rarely added anything and were mostly gratuitous.  The fight sequences were well done because of impressive computer graphics, but hardly make the movie worth seeing.

The movie leaves you to guess on the exact circumstances surrounding Bruce's conception and eventual adaption into the Hulk. We see flashbacks but there is no real background information about what is going on! What was the purpose of Professor Banner's laboratory studies? Why was it so radical that he would use human samples for his studies? Why did Betty's father hate Professor Banner so much? At least that part is evident! Not to mention, what was the purpose of Professor Banner destroying the lab? The only purpose of the laboratory explosion, in the comics, was so that Bruce could become the Hulk. But since he was born the Hulk, there really was no need for the explosion at all! This movie leaves a lot of questions to be asked! That is why I give it a 5!",Hulk

In the teasers it looked kinda cheesy, but in the actual movie it looked good.  I thought the story and the performances were quite good. Nick Nolte, as Bruce Banner's mad scientist father, was outstanding, as usual.  Jennifer Connelly showed why she's an Oscar winner.  And Sam Elliot did a fine job playing the Army Four Star General bent on finding and destroying the Incredible Hulk.  Eric Bana, in the title role, may not have been my first choice, but he was very good also.I don't know why some people are slamming this movie.  There was plenty of action, great special efx, a good story and good performances. What more could one want?  I suppose there are those that don't want to allow any screen time for character or plot development.  Just wham, bam!  Give me the Hulk!  We want two frickin' hours of just the Hulk smashing things. Huh, huhhh, huhhhhh, that'd be cool.  Well, no thanks, Beavis.I think Ang Lee did an outstanding job with the style and look of this film and showed why he's such a great film-maker.

This is not in anyway remotely interesting to anyone except those who think that terrible acting and clunky dialogue is enthralling.

779,HouseofPainCakes,"Notable effort, lackluster result",4,2 September 2003,"What, precisely, are the elements that drive a successful action movie? It's a question that is trickier than one would think at first glance. This could be one of the reasons that action films, more than any other movie genre operating today, adhere so closely to well-worn cinematic traditions. So when a film like ""Hulk,"" the latest effort from Ang Lee and his frequent writing partner, James Schamus, comes along, it's hard to fault the creators for attempting something relatively different from the standard good-bad, bang-boom Hollywood fare.  But ultimately, the film's flaws far outweigh the new perspective, dragging the film down in a mire of needless backstory and unlikely plot twists.Eric Bana stars as The Man Who Would Be Green, Bruce Banner.  He's a bottled-up biotech worker, fretting away in a top-secret research facility that is somewhat lazily funded by the military.  Potential villians are everywhere: the general who signs Bana's checks (Sam Elliott), the hotshot private industry wag who threatens to buy out their operation (a sniffy Josh Lucas), Bana's deadbeat dad (Nick Nolte, doing an alarming Katherine Hepburn parody).  Considering the number of shady character running around, it's surprising to find out how long it takes the pieces to fall into place for the creation of Banner's alter ego, or more accurately, alter id.
Bana's performance in the lead role is less than electric. The filmmakers would like you to believe this is intentional, but watching Banner for an hour - it's that long before we see The Hulk in the flesh - is a wearisome chore.  Other than glowering at his coworkers, he does little more than shuffle listlessly between his microscope and his apartment.Lee and Schamus attempt to depict the creation of The Hulk as a combination of scientific accident, repressed rage, and deep-seated psychological trauma: Banner's father was engaged in research very similar to Bruce's work, there are hints of a domestic accident from Bruce's youth; both Elliott and his daughter, Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly), seem to have a history with the Banner family.  None of these separate plotlines come together in a satisfying manner.  Instead of building towards a powerful resolution, they distract the film endlessly for the first half, then retreat far into the background during the second half.
When The Hulk finally appears, the film struggles to find him a worthy opponent.  Since the most important battle, Banner versus his own rage and resentment, is internal, the action sequences seem secondary, although Lee stages some interesting showdowns against a barrage of tanks, super-soldier canines, and a creature than can assume the form of anything it touches. But as the film tries to juggle the dramatic and spectacular, neither are given the time or energy required to create a real impact.  In the end, we are left with two half-films, both vaguely intriguing, but both far more green than ripe.",Hulk

I personally would take charge of seeing to this happening, because spending an hour + in the movie theater was one of the worst experiences i have ever had in my life. The plot, the random comic book scene changes, and of course Nick Nolte's giant rabid dogs put the stamp on this movie for movie suicide. I am deeply disappointed that respectable actors such as Nick Nolte, Eric Bana, and Jennifer Conelly did not tear the script apart and warn others never to read it. They must really love money.

When the movie was finished, there was an overall excitement in the theater (adults and kids) and most people acted as Hulk....I would just add that I never read any Hulk comics before the movie so I was not influenced in any ways with the comic Hulk character.

782,angelsevillathethird,It's as bad as you've heard,3,1 April 2020,"The direction and tone set by Ang Lee is all wrong for this movie. The editing is weird too. There are a lot of fade outs and split screen shots. A LOT of them. Eric Bana's acting is not good, it's awkward with bad timing. Jennifer Connolly's acting has no range and her voice is too quiet. The whole movie is too quiet. I can barely hear Nick Nolte.Spoilers Ahead:They seem to be implying that Bruce Banner's Hulkiness has been in his blood since his conception, by way of his own father injecting himself with a strum that's supposed to speed up cell regeneration. He injects himself, impregnates Hulk's mom, and makes a baby Hulk.But the gama-ray explosion happens too, in Banner's adulthood. So like the regeneration helped him survive the explosion I guess, but he was already Hulky inside. He just needed to get mad about something. And luckily for this movie, Bruce Banner doesn't get mad at all in his life, ever, until he's like 25 years old.So he becomes Hulk, he kills some dogs, his father kills the only black actor in this movie, and then nothing else happens for about 30 minutes. He repeats that he can't remember multiple times. Thunderbolt Ross says he's gonna lock Banner up ""For the rest of his natural life"" multiple lines. The pacing after that really suffers. There's not actually much dialogue throughout, thank goodness because the dialogue that is here is not quality. And at this point Hulk hasn't even faced up against the movie's villain and I wish it was over.",Hulk
783,alaydown,Mixed Review--Mostly Bad,6,21 June 2003,"I had mixed feelings. I generally love this kind of movie, but this one had some problems. I'll preface my remarks by stating that the movie wasn't all bad. I'll get to some of the positive comments eventually.For the first half of the movie, one could say it dragged, but that might be the wrong label. There was history that needed explaining and characters that needed development. The movie attempted to explain the history, but I thought it fell short there and with character development. It seemed slow because some of the story danced around trying to keep a bit of mystery about Bruce Banner's past, but that got to be annoying the longer it went on. It would have been better to just let the viewer know everything early on, and then concentrate on developing the characters rather than dragging the viewer into the same slow-to-discover timeline that the characters go through. Some of the hammering of flashbacks would not have been so annoying. The opening sequence explains some of the early history of Bruce Banner well enough, but it forces the viewer to really concentrate too much on every detail shown because some of it was too fast and hard to read or understand. I liked the idea used, but some of it could have been better shown, better edited or better explained. By the time that ""mystery"" of Bruce's repressed memory is revealed by Nick Nolte, I thought sarcastically, ""big surprise."" Getting to that point was agonizingly slow, which might have not been slow if the director didn't try to shroud that part in a mystery to the viewers for so long.The scene with young Bruce heading off for college probably could have been edited out--it is almost like they were trying for a character relationship shown in Spider-Man between the title character and his foster mother, but it provides nothing for this story except to point out that Bruce is adopted. I never got the feeling that Bruce thought much at all as an adult about his foster parents. That info could have been passed along by part of the rapid early history shown in the beginning.There are two things that really bothered me about this movie the most. One is annoying split screens and multiple-angle views of some of the action/non-action. It was really overdone, sometimes showing as many as five views at the same time of nothing happening. The reason for splitting a screen should be to give the viewer a perspective that couldn't be shown by a single shot, for example to explain events that occur simultaneously. Instead, Lee bombards us with these 2-5 view split screens over and over when some of them serve no purpose at all. A few of them would have been alright if timed better to give the viewer a comic book feeling, IF that is what the director was really trying to do. To me it looked like the director and editor were experimenting for the first time with this movie-making technology. We also didn't need to see super-fast camera moves in some scenes--these only served to reinforce my opinion of their experimenting with technology.The other worst thing about this movie is the cartoonish CGI characters. One of the mutant hulk dogs looked like that silly cartoon dog in the movie ""The Mask"" when Jim Carrey's dog is wearing it. CGI can be well done, but for the most part it is over-used in today's movies when compared to special effects in older movies. These CGI characters look worse than the creatures in the 1950's Godzilla movies or some of the really bad old dinosaur movies. They don't move naturally, and they look too cartoonish. I appreciated the attempt to make Hulk look like the comic book character, even down to the purple colored pants. [The comic books before the Hulk used purple clothing only on bad guys.] But this Hulk at times just looks too weird. It's almost like they ran out of time working on it and slapped this character together. Some scenes look pretty decent, but other scenes are terrible. I don't think that another Lou Ferrigno would be the answer, but perhaps an actor with great body makeup combined with good computer special effects and digitizing the actor would be a better way to go.The acting was good in general for the story they had to work with. Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot were both good for their parts, but should have had better material. All of the characters didn't have much depth at all to them. To explain that would require a lengthy explanation and spoilers. Jennifer Connelly had too many crying scenes, and her first onscreen appearance with Eric Bana looked too stiff. These two are good actors, but they did not seem to have any chemistry together. Connelly was also not very believable as a scientist, probably due to the material she had to work with.Not all of the CGI was bad. For example, the transformations from Hulk to Banner were well done, and the daytime action between Hulk and the tanks was very good. The ending credits were great in comic book fashion, and the music score was good although not Elfman's best work. The basic story outline was good, but there were several holes in the details. Additionally, the climactic battle between Hulk and his father and the scene before it between Bana and Nolte were poorly written and directed. These were the wrong director and writer for this film.Overall, I am generous giving it a 6 out of 10.",Hulk
784,Ev_Rock,A Beautifully Dark Comic Book Character Study,9,26 June 2003,"Ang Lee's Hulk is a wonder to behold, even when the action on screen starts to slow. Many viewers will be disappointed by the big green guy's lack of screen time, but Lee's innovative directing style will carry film fans through the rough patches. When the Hulk is on screen, the fun manifests itself in the form of massive destruction, three-mile jumps, and a surprising conclusion involving Bruce Banner's father (brought to life by the wonderfully weird Nick Nolte). When Bruce banner is on screen, the movie takes on another tone entirely as it explores heavy themes such as domestic abuse and repressed memories. With his beautifully dark cinematography and comic-style editing techniques, Ang Lee pulls these seemingly disparate elements together into an equally thrilling and thought-provoking film. Thumbs up also to Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly for their emotionally layered performances. 9/10",Hulk

The Hulk takes some time to appear (about 40 minutes), but when he does we see the conflict at our protagonist's core. He does his best to avoid losing control, but as he admits, when he does give in to his rage, he likes it.Now compare this to Edward Norton's turn, where there is no display of conflict in his personality, and he turns into the Hulk whenever he becomes excited and his pulse rate hits 200 beats per minute (not 183, not 197, but exactly 200). To this reviewer, this felt akin to the introduction of midi-chlorians in The Phantom Menace, which tell how strong the ""force"" is with one, as if mystical abilities can be gauged through a blood test. In the 2008 movie, all Ed Norton's Bruce Banner has to do is to keep his pulse rate under 200, as monitored by a device strapped onto his wrist. And for the record, it is extremely difficult to get one's pulse rate up to 200 even through a very exhilarating run, especially for a physically fit person.Emotions drive Eric Bana's Hulk. He has repressed memories of his mother's death and his father's role in his early life. On the surface he is calm, but there underneath there is significant anger, enough rage to fuel the Hulk when it is unleashed. But the Hulk never kills intentionally, even his attackers. Mostly, he just wants to get away or close to Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). He incapacitates his shooters and in one critical scene, saves a fighter jet pursuing him from a collision.In the 2003 movie, the visual effects are there, but as necessary. The action scenes (and there are plenty of them) are necessary to the plot, unlike the 2008 movie where action is inserted for the sake of action.The only thing going against the 2003 movie is that it is perhaps not as true to the comic books as the 2008 version. However, even as I am a fan of the comics, I would prefer a movie that is not as true to the comics as a fanboy's dream but has heart over the comics-loyal but manufactured and soulless 2008 version any day.Perhaps Ang Lee should have read more comics. Iron Man, also released in 2008, is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comic-book roots and has heart.I am stunned that IMDb users have given such a low score to this movie. Normally, IMDb users provide very reliable ratings. I hope that in time this movie comes to be recognized as the classic that it is.",Hulk
789,Drucifer,An experiment gone horribly wrong,6,23 June 2003,"Ang Lee's Hulk may be the very first true comic book film. Forget about Spider-Man, Superman, X-Men; this movie is a comic book right down to the font used for the opening credits.  Comic book fans (myself included) are probably intrigued by this idea, but after just a few minutes into Hulk, one realizes that the comic book style does not translate well onto celluloid. At all.  It ends up being a self-indulgent bubble-gun fantasy, totally devoid of any deeper meaning.  This is not the film that the Incredible Hulk deserves.Hulk, directed by Ang Lee (of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon)  is the story of a genetic scientist, Bruce Banner (played by Eric Bana), on the verge of a great discovery in the field of cell reproduction.  He is accidentally exposed to gamma radiation during an experiment gone awry, which, in conjunction with his own already altered DNA, causes him to become a rampaging green giant when he is properly provoked.  It may sound silly, but it actually had great potential to be a very serious analysis of rage and the human psyche.  Unfortunately, the potential for Hulk to be a serious film is tossed out the window by Lee who chooses to edit the film not as a conventional director would, but instead as if each frame were part of a comic book, complete with frames within frames, freeze-frames and odd cuts.The common problem with films adapted from comic books is that they tend to fall prey to the 'cheese factor.'  The corny dialogue and ridiculous situations that can be accepted in comic books don't translate well into live action films.  Hulk overcomes this obstacle admirably.  The dialogue is well written and mostly well acted, especially by Jennifer Connelly, who obviously takes her role as seriously as her role in A Beautiful Mind (for which she won an Oscar).  Bana, in his first leading role, is also relatively good, especially in his scenes opposite Connelly.  The supporting cast, however, often rely on worn stereotypes to portray their characters, especially Josh Lucas as Talbot and the over-the-top Nick Nolte as David Banner.One of the biggest concerns going into the movie theatre was the appearance of the Hulk himself.  The CGI (computer generated imagery) had come under a lot of criticism by pretty much everyone that had seen the trailer.  Lo and behold, the CGI is actually quite good.  It's by no means worse than Gollum from The Two Towers (commonly considered the benchmark in computer generated characters): the only difference is that the Hulk switches back and forth from human to computer, which accentuates the difference between the two. The only thing that can really be complained about is that the Hulk is able to jump what appears to be several miles in a single bound.  Even with one's belief properly suspended, this appears out of place and silly.Even with the slight qualms about the effects and the acting, the film is still not all that bad.  Until you actually sit down and watch it: the film's editing renders it practically unwatchable.  The comic book style split-screens and cuts are, to be frank, nauseating.  Many of the special effects have a deliberately lo-fi look, as if they're attempting to capture the `comic book magic' on screen.  They look out of place and ridiculous. (Watch for the gamma rays.)  The script, performances, and even the direction (before post-production) are all good.  It is Lee's ambition to create the world's first moving comic strip that smashes (pun intended) this film into mediocrity.  Lee's split-screens and digital tinkering ruin scenes that demand a serious tone from the audience.  A more conventional approach could have saved this movie from being the campy farce that it winds up as.It's ironic how film mirrors reality.  An experiment gone horribly wrong turns something good (the well intentioned screenplay) into something disastrous (the finished product).  It's also ironic that a film about anger management left me so angry.(Note: the PG rating on Hulk is not to be taken lightly.  There are several scenes involving violence against animals that children may find very disturbing.)Final Rating: 5.5 out of 10",Hulk
790,geoffmart,"Unfortunately, The Hulk tries to be too much",5,24 June 2003,"It appears as though Ang Lee created a taut, psychologically intricate film that the studio forced him to re-work at the last minute. One article I read stated that Lee was told to increase the action element of the film; as a viewer, this seems to be what happened.The tension of Bruce's torn subconscious, his relationship with Betty, the involvement of General Ross, and the sociopathic ambition of David Banner are all lost in an overly-convoluted quasi-summer blockbuster.
I have nothing against plot strings that seem too numerous to count, but the problem with The Hulk is that the viewer can never see how one string crosses another or where one string ends and another begins; this leads to a jumbled mess that does nothing more than confuse and irritate the audience.Luckily, Lee's solid movie-making abilities allows the plot to progress (more or less), but it is undeniable that his attempt at making a brooding, introspective psychological thriller was derailed by somebody (money-hungry studio execs?) and never fully fit the mold of ""awesome summer blockbuster action movie"" or ""deep, engaging, thought-provoking thriller."" It ended up being a sloppy mess of each, never fully satisfying either audience.I feel bad picking apart a work that took so long to produce, but as a Marvel fan I would have been happy with a ""slam-bang, turn-off-your-brain-for-two-hours"" action movie or a ""hmmm...there's so much depth to the Bruce/Hulk dichotomy"" film. Instead, I paid $8 to see a half-cocked movie about a guy and his dad and a green monster... and stuff.",Hulk

792,John Farthing,"Boring, Long, and not Fun to watch.",1,20 June 2003,"The set up was long and tedious. Over an hour before he turns in the Hulk. Not enough action, not funny, not fun to watch. The crowd at the movie was bored. Kids were throwing candy. I don't blame them, you had to do something to kill time in between the action. What a bust!",Hulk
793,LeviticusStroud,Don't make it Ang Lee. You wouldn't like it when it's Ang Lee.,2,26 October 2011,"**Warning, Spoilers**The biggest shame about Hulk is that it had such great potential, which is desperately trying to get out from the shadow of a self obsessed narcissistic director whose talent has been vastly overblown in the telling.The story and acting are both, essentially, sound. Even the divergences from the comic mythology (David Banner, Absorbing Man, pre-gamma DNA manipulation) are well considered and fit the concept. Unfortunately, Ang Lee then steps in and removes all the best points of these and turns the film into a turkey.One notable poor point is the editing and the use of 'comic book panes' that drift across the screen, several at a time and often not in any logical nor chronological order of what is going on, is distracting, pointless and detracts from the rest of the film. This, however, falls to insignificance next to the utterly preposterous minimisation of violence and the consequences thereof!If Hulk hits you hard enough to smash you through a solid wall, across a street and into a car- with enough left over force to crack windscreens and dent body panels- you do not spend the rest of the movie walking around in a cast or two bemoaning a few broken bones. You're DEAD!Similarly at one point we see Hulk fight quite a few military vehicles, including attack helicopters and tanks. Does anyone die? Nope! Choppers are taken out the air at several hundred feet. Turrets are ripped off and the gunners still inside them get flung for hundreds of yards, but apparently landing inside several tons of metal without any fall arrest equipment will only leave you a little disorientated provided you land on a sand dune. Please, even the producers of the A Team TV series thought doing things like that was dumb and couldn't be taken seriously!So despite being such a huge threat to the military that they have to send billions of dollars of equipment to get blown up and wrecked, Hulk doesn't kill or maim a single person. In fact only one character dies 'because' of Hulk- and he is the aforementioned bad guy who went through a wall and ended up inconvenienced with a broken collar and a limp. And this guy effectively shot himself with an explosive due to it rebounding. Are you kidding me? Is this a Saturday morning cartoon for the under 10s?However, the final nail in the coffin of this film and the reason it got rebooted just 5 years alter without a single person from the production carried over is Hulk himself. Not simply the poor CGI which was so hyped as being the best thing ever, but because the motion capture for the acting is so inconsistent. At one point Hulk is believable, the next an exaggerated puppet. Having watched a 'making of' the reason behind this quickly became apparent. Failed actor Ang Lee insisted on doing a whole bunch of scenes in the effects suit himself, and funnily enough it is those ones which stink to high heaven.This could have been a great movie, and I suspect that taking the original footage, redoing some of the CGI (and motion capture with Eric Bana instead of Lee), a couple of pick up shots and re-editing could turn this into a solid 8 or 9. As it is the 3 rating I have given it is purely for the points where the actors get to actually do their stuff and aren't being held back by the man who thinks a few sweeping panorama shots are more important than little things like plausibility.",Hulk
794,moonkids,Decent but flawed comic adaptation,8,26 June 2003,"Hulk is certainly deeper than most other films of its genre. The acting is above average, and the story is slightly less cliched than usual. I also liked the comic-book style editing. Unfortunately it suffers from being over-long, from plot implausibility toward the end, and from the look of the CGI Hulk, who appears as though he's made of the same clay as Gumby. I would have liked him to be a darker colour and have less smooth and plastic skin-- maybe then he would be worthy of the boasting coming from his creators (they said he looks more real than Gollum in Lord of the Rings-- they wish).8 out of 10",Hulk

But....I came this past week to think, maybe Ang Lee could make it happen, so i bought my advanced tixs.The Film, to state it quickly was a little slow at first, allowing u to breath in the characters before all the action, then it kicked up a notch using a pannel multi split screen look to make the Comic in it arise. In all it was a settleing, action packed, but mostly character driven piece. With great acting from all sides of the spectrum, And to top it all off, you got Alan Lee, and the original Hulk as security guards....keep an eye out.I call it the best comic movie ever (aside from maybe the original Batman)",Hulk

The story told by the movie shows a warm compassion for my favourite main characters, Eric Bana (Bruce Banner), Jennifer Connelly (Betty Ross), Sam Elliott (Betty's Military Dad) and Nick Nolte (Bruce's Father - a most satisfying anti-hero).The Hulk effects were very exciting on the big screen, and it fit perfectly with the efforts made to fill in the story of Bruce and his father.I was getting a tad restless in some parts towards the end of the movie when the energy of the film starts to slide a bit, but I was just too hyped from the action scenes!My favourite scene: watching Eric Banna's charismatic face made huge, green and angry and then sad, lost, confused and somewhat love struck by the tender face of Jennifer Connelly (Betty Ross). (For some reason, it reminded me of a very funny Eric Bana in Channel 10's Full Frontal - used to be on Australian TV 1992 to 1994.)Rob :)",Hulk

First I would like to address that it takes and hour and a half before Bruce ever turns into the Hulk. This makes the movie that much worse. Second the action that takes place is cartoon action which leaves me very uninterested, not only that but the Hulk looks more a man in a giant rubber suit. Third Ang Lee directs and did some inventive things like makeing the shots more like a comic book which good but mostly confusing, not only that but I doubt that a Chinese man has ever seen let alone heard of The Hulk. The only good spot on this movie is that Stan Lee (creator of the Hulk) and Lou Ferrigno (The Hulk from the T.V. Show) make a cameo apperence.

I thought Sam Elliot and Nick Nolte did an awesome job in their rolls. Eric and Jennifer were also good. When I saw the Hulk Shrek did come to mind, it may be because they are both green and have the same size ears.

The acting was solid, the story was great, the action and effects were well done, and Ang Lee captured the emotion of the Hulk most superhero/comic book movies lack these days.Thats not to say there were some flaws in this film. My main problem is the plot goes a bit slow in some places, but not the places that people criticize the most. Most people hated this movie because its not a "" smash and bash"" big action movie it was marketed as. But I see the movie in the way its supposed to be made: About the personality of the Hulk, and not the ""smashing and bashing"" people wanted to see. The people who wanted to see that movie would have to wait 5 years before one came out ( the 2008 Incredible Hulk)Overall, an excellent movie, over criticized, underrated and disappointed they didn't make a sequel to this great film.

808,BNP,Horrible movie,2,17 June 2003,"Well, I have now not only seen the worst of the year, but I have now seen the worst movie, I have ever seen.HULK is one of the biggest pieces of crap ever made. I have no respect for Ang Lee, Eric Bana (not that I did before), Jennifer Connelly or Sam Elliott anymore. Well maybe I still have some respect for Elliot, becuase he's a cool guy. But still no respect for the others. Oh, and I'll throw in Nick Nolte as well.Where to begin in the bashing of this movie? Hmmm, maybe in the extremely long and boring setup for the Hulk. No. What about the horrid acting? No. Well, then what about the bad CGI? Ah, no. Then I must start with the lowsey transitions? God, no. Then what about the comic book style editing? HA!! No!!I'll just pick one. The performances. Wow!! Could anyone BE anymore emotionless in this movie? Bana and Connelly delivers such horrible performances. They seemed like they were just sleepwalking through the whole thing. The lines were delivered with no emotion, and everything was flat. No life. Come on people, you ever heard of pep pills?!Now time for the CGI. Wow, if I thought the CGI in the Matrix Reloaded was pretty weak, I think I need to change my mind. Hulk has some of the worst CGI I've seen. George Lucas is gonna freak out when he sees this stuff. The Hulk-Dogs get the worst of the animation.Now let me talk about (or rant) about the horrid transitions and comic book style editing. This movie isnt Star Wars, the wierd scene to scene transitions arent aloud in this movie, mostly becuase they dont work. Also the lousy and very stupid idea of comic book style editing was horrible. They put boxes on the screen and showed differant things going on in each box at times.The normal public doesnt already like comic book movies, so why give them something to hate even and fall back on as evidence as to why comic book movies suck?Superman, Batman (1989), Spider-Man and Blade are the best comic book to movie adaptations I have seen. They actually tried to look like normal movies, while also being comic book movies. Its a little hard to explain my way of thinking there, but it makes sense. I think Hulk brianed my damage.The dialogue is horrible in this movie as well. Like this line ""Ah s**t, he has my missle."" Oh, ah, I guess thats supposed to BE funny, but... I'm not laughing. At least when Blade & Blade II writer David Goyer wrote Blade II, he made it kind of sound like a comic book, with out it sounding lame.
The movie also suffers from lame action as well. All the battle scenes and action is crap.Now, I'm not a Hulk fan. Most all of you know I'm a Batman and Superman fan. Well I also like Blade and Spider-Man is alright, but over-rated. I dont want this to turn into a ""whos better/whos not"" arguement, but what I dont understand about the Hulk is, is he good or bad? In the movie he never actually helped anyone. All he did was destroy lots of Government property and city property. It doesnt appear to me that he is a ""super-hero"".
Like what does he do? If someone needs his help does he goto them and let them tell him the story and why they need him and then he says, hey ok, get me mad so I have a reason to stop these people. Pretty lame.Also, if he does help people, he does a bad job. In the movie he pretty goes on a rampage of San Fransico (wheres Dirty Harry when you need him?) and he destroys lots of city property like I mentioned. Now, I figure to fix all this damage, the city of San Fransisco is going to raise taxes pretty high. So in the end, Hulk didnt save anyone, he destroyed the citizens lives, becuase the taxes are going to be raised, and some wont be able to afford where they live and they will lose their houses. Husbands will divorced and lose their children and wife. They will lose their cars and everything they worked hard for.In the end, Hulk is a bad guy and needs to destroyed. I can understand why people want him captured. Look at what he did to their happy little lives.
Maybe I put too much thought into that, but if the movie wasnt so bad, I wouldnt have had to. Eesh.This movie is a lousy piece of crap. Go see it if you want, but you'll be wasting your money.",Hulk

I like that the Hulk is CGI because we can now see him on the scale of which he is meant to be seen. I didn't like that it took so long for the action to develop and the plot was a little thin. Another gripe I have is that they only gave Lou Ferrigno a 5 second cameo alongside Stan Lee. Couldn't they have come up with something better for the original Hulk.,Hulk
815,Queen-of-hearts,It's no Spider Man,2,20 June 2003,"X-Men and Spiderman were good adaptions from comic books for three reasons: Good character development, neat special effects, and neither one takes itself too seriously.  After all, they come from a comic book!Hulk has only one, SPECIAL EFFECTS, and even they're not very impressive.It's held back by its slow storytelling and over done drama, and refuses to have any fun with what it has.The Hulk jumping around like a grasshopper kept me from believing he's real, and is followed by his inconsistent movement. The acting isn't poor, but it's not great.  And overall, the comic split screen becomes old very quickly, and continues through the film.With all its faults, I could not enjoy the movie.  The sad part is, we're all sure to see more comic-to-film adaptions. I can only hope they're not anything like this.",Hulk
816,gj804,Not That Good...,4,5 January 2004,"I will have to admit. I am NOT a fan of the Marvel Comic. But with my general knowledge about this story I definitely expected more from the movie. The reviewers were right, this movie did look good. And the story looked like it had promise especially in the first act. But somewhere in the middle of the movie, the producers just decided to say ""to heck with the story, like get to the terrorizing."" Yes there is a lot of action and special effects but overall in the end it was pretty below average.2 out of 5",Hulk
817,wanatry_me,The worst film I've seen EVER makes the 70's series look cool,1,6 July 2003,"I almost fell asleep during the first 45 minutes of this waste of good celluloid, the cheesy abuse of Brian De Palma's use of split screen in his 1976 film Carrie, which was used effectively,(not that I've ever been a great fan of it) was taken to a new high presumably to distract from the lack of....of... well anything that one could consider either good cinematography or dialogue, how remarkably unlike Spiderman or the X-men, both of which I thoroughly enjoyed. Bill Bixby and Jack Colvin were far more believable in their 1977 TV series centred around childrens entertainment,  I believe on a sunday afternoon on the BBC. And to think I missed a re-run of Gerry Andersons Thunderbirds to watch it. My advise don't waste your money, maybe support your local childrens or amateur theatre, I guarantee it will be more rewarding",Hulk
818,spielberg00,THE HULK is truly amazing.,8,2 September 2011,"It's kind of cool how they made THE HULK look like an on screen, live action comic book. I don't think I've seen any of Ang Lee's other movies, but he did a fantastic job as director of this one. This film is much, much better than the 2008 reboot (which is titled THE INCREDIBLE HULK, and of the two, this one is definitively the incredible one), and it is much more intense. It begins as a life story, in superhero style, and when it has ended, it has already had its two hours and eighteen minutes to blow your mind. But that's the one thing that I don't like about THE HULK: it runs a little long. I guess we deserve something in the superhero sub-genre that's actually UN-superficial like this.",Hulk
819,l-wayne,A surprising (HULK) smash!,9,21 June 2003,"I was blessed enough to get a preview ticket to see HULK on Thursday 19th in London, and i am going on record to say that this movie cripples the other super-hero films out there right now. Having grown up with the tv series, tv films & cartoon i was a bit dubious about hollywood ge ,tting their money grubbing hands on this project but...This movie nearly has eveything that is needed for a blockbuster, action, budding romance, rivalry, character histories, sentimental values and a explosive ending. The only thing i have qualms about is the fact that it got a 12A rating when there are some disturbing scenes that i will not mention.(See it for your self) I have a feeling that only fans will like this comic to big screen transformation. 9/10Thank you for listening, L.Wayne",Hulk
820,Taizong,A comic brought to life - slow building action,10,21 June 2003,"I saw the movie The Hulk today, Ang Lee's grand interpretation of a comic book classic and huge fan favorate. My immediate response to this film is ""holy crap, it was like reading a comic book, only on film.....very wierd and immensely entertaining"". Watching each scene is like flipping through the pages of a good comic, with amazing transitions that make the surreal intricities of ""Fight Club"" look amatuer.Now onto the film. I won't bore you with an exhaustive plot outline, nor a quick narration - I'm sure that almost everyone is famailar with the basic principles of the Hulk story. I'll instead narrate my personal experience and give a breif critique of the cast:Jennifer Connelly was good as usual - no real complaints with her acting job. One scene in general with her bugged me however: being attacked by huge mutant dogs while being protected by your boyfriend that suddenly appeared as a huge green monster would usually put you under a great deal of duress. During the entire scene Connelly appears perfectly serene. Eric Bana's work as Bruce Banner really won him some respect from me. I was skeptical of his abilities coming into the film, but was relieved by his excellent work. Nick Nolte, as Bruce Banner's father, was terrific. Classic skulking Nolte highlighted by a rather dramatic flashback concerning the demis of his wife - I almost forgot that Nolte could actually act, and act very well. Sam Elliot as Ross, Connelly's father, couldn't have been casted better. The rest of the cast was really inconsequential. Nonetheless, Lee spent so much time character building that having only four main characters doesn't hinder the film at all.The first 30-40 minutes is very slow paced, filled with vintage Ang Lee character building, foreshadowing, and drama. Fans looking for a pure action film will be dissapointed with the first half of the movie. Hulk fans will appreciate the time that Ang Lee takes to identify the huge disparity between the calm of Bruce Banner and the relentless fury of the unleashed Hulk. Regardless of personal taste, it will be hard for many movie goers to discount how impressively Lee brings to life a breathing, fluid comic. I still find it hard to explain, it's difficult to convey with words what the experience is like - you really have to see it for yourself. A suprising cameo by Lou Ferrigno (the actor that portrayed the Hulk in the television series) and Stan Lee (creator of every worthwhile Marvel comic ever, including the X-Men, Spiderman, Daredevil, and the Silver Surfer) had everyone laughing.The initial ""release"" of the Hulk was ominous and creepy. The packed house (every seat was filled) collectively gasped at the scary transformation and insuing blitzkrieg of destruction. Each transformation is similar, highlighted perfectly with moments of calm and reflection that Hulk fans will instantly recognize: a brief moment of calm amid the flurry, the quiet distraction of a desert flower, the slow exhale before another rush of rage engulfs the Hulk. Did I mention that Ang Lee completely brought to life the Hulk character? You can tell that this guy was a major fan.Anyways, the second half of the film is highlighted by amazing action scenes that serve the film very well. Watchers that were becoming bored with the movie during the first half will be happy that they decided to wait it out. A fight scene between the Hulk and three mutant canines was about as visually impressive as the sword battle between Li Mu Bai and Xiou Long/Jen Yu in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The fight concludes with a brutal release of rage by the Hulk that many small children really shouldn't see (he basically tears his last opponent to pieces). The Hulk's escape from a secret underground military facility in the middle of the desert (vintage comic book material) was a hillarious and over-the-top action sequence highlighted by the death of his main adversary - a demise which is captured in perfect comic fashion - another scene that is hard to convey with words (I can tell you that the entire audience was laughing and clapping though). It ends after an amazing scene involving the Golden Gate Bridge, a F-18, and space. Fucking wicked.The build up to the finale is arguably drawn out, but again, I think that you will be pleased with the outcome. I won't go too much into detail, but the Hulk's arch enemy The Absorbing Man leads him through a battle that is quite simply the most visually amazing fight scene that I have even seen. Yes, even better then ""The Burly Brawl"" between Neo and a hundred Smiths in The Matrix: Reloaded. If you watch the movie after reading this review, tell me, wasn't the ""lightning scene"" genious?My final thoughts: 9.0 out of 10. See that shit.",Hulk
821,njmeyers,Solid effort,7,23 June 2003,"I really wanted to like the Hulk going in to see the movie and I did. I thought the acting was great, the story was pretty good and the CGI was decent. Eric Bana played Brue Banner perfectly. I look forward to the sequel and hope to see him in a lab trying to come up with a way to ""cure"" himself. My favorite part of the movie was a scene that had the Hulk and Brue Banner on screen at the same time. The battle with the military was sweet!I could have done without the very end of the movie that dealt with Bruce and his father. It just didn't click with me for some reason. Some of the split screen stuff was really good and some of it I could have done without.The CGI was much better than I was expecting. Don't let the bad commercials sway you on this. With that being said, it is very apparent that ILM is no longer the best FX company on the block any more. Gollum from Lord of the Rings was done much better.Now to respond to some things I've read in other reviews. This movie does have a couple of funny moments in it. It is not as dark as everyone is saying. I did not find the first hour boring at all. It seems to me that people are forgetting comic books do have dialogue in them. I did not find the opening hour too ""talky"" at all. Also I don't see how people are saying this movie is a ""box office bomb"" since it ONLY made 62 million. It had the biggest opening in history for a June release. Also please remember not all comic books are campy, ""funny books"". Some books actually tackle real issue, dark or otherwise, so it would be unfair to say ""Why was Ang Lee trying to make a film about a comic book ""deep""?"".This movie is not for everyone. There will be comic fans who love it, like it (like me), think it is just ok or who will hate it. There will also be non comic fans who will feel the same way. I will say this is as close to a comic book being on screen as we've had visually and structure wise. Let's just hope they take a step further with the sequel.",Hulk
822,bartman700,A thinking mans comic book movie,8,1 July 2003,"This movie stands on its own and that the way it should be viewed.  If you try to compare it to other comic book adaptions, then you won't enjoy it. And if you expect it to follow the comic book, then you'll be disappointed too.  Just as in the television version, the origins of the hulk were different because in modern times, the government isn't blasting nuclear bombs in the desert no more, so I found the origins of how Dr. Banner becomes the hulk orginial.  The same thing with Spiderman, there were little complaints about Peter Parker being bitten by a genetically altered spider instead of a radioactive spider and having webs coming out of his wrists instead of creating the wrist web shooters. The movies starts slows and thats what the moviegoer doesnt expect with a summer movie.  The action sequences are good when they arrive half way through the film.  The directing is good.  Ang Lee does a great job, even though some think he was wrong for this movie.  The CGI Hulk does appear better when hes in sunlight than at night.  Hopefully, Universal Picture will make The Hulk appear better when the sequel comes out, its already been announced there will be one. As I rate movies from ""It was so great I should rent it on DVD as soon as it come out"" to ""This movie was such a waste, I should let a friend rent it when it comes out on video so I don't waste my money, I would buy it and add it to my DVD collection.",Hulk

The scenes and the way they made the scenes look like it was out of a comic book was original and good. The plot though was stale. I expected more out of this movie and it sure has let me down.

826,profx72,You're Making Me Angry...You wouldn't like me when I'm angry,9,3 August 2003,"It makes me angry that so many people have panned this excellent and exciting version of the Hulk.  What many movie goers remember is Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno.  While this was good for the 70's, you have to remember a few things.  Firstly, the comic book was based on Robert ""Bruce"" Banner, and the Hulk mutated because of a military accident.  The TV show was based on David ""Bruce"" Banner, and was a medical experiment.  The movie combines the two, eliminating the first name of Robert or David, and combining the storylines.Secondly, in the comic, it took over 200 issues before any of his father's abuse to make itself known.  (I blame the comic code, but that's just me.) This evolution of the character made Bruce Banner a much more interesting character.  The Hulk isn't really about action and adventure, even though Ang Lee did an excellent job of making the action sequences more astonishing than anything I had ever seen before, including the Matrix.  It was about the inner turmoil of the man dealing with his past, and the rage and anger that is in all of us.  It is that subtle point that should be remembered when judging this movie.If you didn't see this movie because of these poorly written and considered reviews of the movie, see it when you can on video.  If you panned it, see it again and try to see beyond your previous opinion.  The movie was good, and you're foolish not to like it.",Hulk
827,Sabre77,Don't bother,1,27 March 2004,"So many places to start, but nothing good to say about The NOT Incredible Hulk. Boring, Boring, Boring. Any more Boring and I would have thought that this was a DC movie and not a Marvel one. Tragically awful comes to mind. I haven't seen something this bad since that Anita Bryant concert. I'm not joking. This movie S U C K S. The only saving grace is when the dialogue stops and the RAMPAGE begins!The plot is incoherent. The original concept featured a scientist bathed in gamma rays while saving a teenager from certain death, who then turns into a muscle monster! The ""movie"" takes more than the concept of liberty with the original plotline and produces precisely what you would expect of a bad Hulk comic book. I should say MORE than bad Hulk comic book to emphasise the frequency of bad Hulk stories. This rates as top worst all time. A pre-school attempt at a serious subject.I think that to do this movie justice I would have to rate it as below both the Captain America and the Punisher movies of the late 80's early 90's. That's bad for those of you scoring at home.I have better things to say about Daredevil and I really didn't like that movie.The Hulk should have been a better movie. It should have been entertaining. There is more than enough story there to accomplish this. Instead a really awful and poorly executed family trauma story between a father and a son is substituted. There is also a recurring green mushroom cloud that indicates a nuclear explosion and yet is never explained into the story.
This movie should be a ""how to screw up a good comic book idea when making a movie"" course for any potential moviemaker.I hope I'm being perfectly candid here;)",Hulk

It also had the problem of being to complicated for a relatively simple audience who expect blockbuster to equate to ""more things blowing up""From an objective stand point, this a fine movie that is beautifully composed and deals with many themes and a gripping plot. The CGI is not as bad as everyone seems to think it is, I don't watch a movie to see a green man constructed from images but from his character, his dialog, his personality. The comic book style editing and interesting soundtrack go quite well with this adaption of the once famous Hulk.Instead of a traditional blockbuster which would've been a fast paced action flick with unnecessary humor, it was a movie with depth that made you think, slightly. (It is a movie about a green man in purple shorts lest we forget)Compared to it's reboot filled with clichéd characters and a predictable ending between two biological beasts, one using his powers for good and the other for evil.

830,cpdickenson,Good action/terrible plot,6,19 March 2006,"Again, shocked at the other reviews on this website have to post some comments: p.s doesn't really contain a spoiler but does give away a little plot info.1. Why is everyone so shocked and pleased that the film dealt with the struggle that the Hulk has going on inside him? Isn't that the basic premise of the character - a basically mild mannered man trying to control his rage because then he goes out of control and becomes the Hulk. I remember that well from the t.v series and though I haven't read many Hulk comics I'm sure its in there too. Yes, the film does that rather well but if it didn't it wouldn't be a Hulk film.2. Am I the only one who found the storyline confusing? The whole thing about Bruce Banner's relationship with his father is just bizarre. Yes it explains the Hulk's background but what is his father trying to achieve when he comes back to find Bruce? It's never made very clear what his aims are beyond his own self preservation - which hardly makes for a deep character, and what the military are aiming for at the end when they let Bruce and Dad meet up is also mystifying to say the least.3.The relationship Bruce's girlfriend has with her father is equally bizarre and frankly tedious. The man agonises over how he has to track down and kill the Hulk because it will break his daughter's heart but he does it anyway, or tries to frequently. She gets angry with him but keeps helping him and in the end they reach some kind of understanding though neither has changed.4. Basically the storyline just goes nowhere - it can't seem to make its mind up over a direction so it just settles for not having one. The film isn't really a kid's film which in a way I liked, in a way found a shame because it should be. It isn't because of the violence that it isn't - its because the storyline is just gibberish and I am sure that children would find the beginning extremely confusing.5. That all said, once the film gets going, the action sequences are fantastic - really does bring the comic book atmosphere to life! Really enjoyed that. Hoping for a sequel, really am, but with a straightforward well developed story story.",Hulk
831,schnippel-1,Green is the colour...,8,22 August 2005,"Hulk is different from the rest of the Marvel comics-turned-movies.First of all, Ang Lee has tried to capture the spirit of a comic book and relate it to the big screen. He makes creative use of split screens and fades throughout the movie. While this is appropriate in the fights and faster (action) scenes, it distracts you from the plot in the quieter dialogue scenes. And yet he still uses them there. It is not as much a comic as Rodriguez' Sin City, yet, especially towards the end when the green man is jumping from canyon to canyon (which I had a hard time getting used to), it is a lot closer to the comic book original than the old TV series was.The second big difference to X-Men, Spider-Man and the like is: there is no humour in Hulk. Apart from the nerd comment at the beginning and the Atlas pose the Hulk strikes while destroying the laboratory, the movie is a dead serious character drama from start to finish. It succeeds in these points, too, but still it is quite unusual to watch a Marvel movie without snickering even once.Still, not that bad as some people might tell you.",Hulk
832,PhantomIsHot,"Underwhelmed in 2003, pleasantly surprised in 2021",7,4 April 2021,"I remember watching this movie in the cinemas when it was released in 2003. I was underwhelmed because I expected more action having seen Spider-man, Daredevil months, years before. I was 18.Last Friday this movie was playing on tv so I decided to watch it again. I was pleasantly surprised by the storytelling & direction. I enjoyed most of the comic book panel scenes - one scene involving death of character was oddly framed I think. The shoots when Hulk & his dad travelled reminded me of a scene of recent MCU movie (can't remember which movie). Perhaps this scene inspired the recent one?I also appreciate the plot now compared to when Hulk was first released. There's no black & white/clear cut good & bad in 4 main characters. I understand the motivations behind their decisions. I'd love to see Bruce's pre-Hulk activation struggles more.Eric Bana was great as Bruce Banner but Jennifer Connelly grabbedy aattention. Her character was multi-layered: scientist, ex-lover, friend/confidant, daughter. Betty's scenes with her father were my favourite. Nick Nolte also gave wonderful performance but that wouldn't have happened well without Paul Kersey's portrayal.The downside of this movie is the lighting. Night scenes are hard to watch.Overall I enjoy this movie very much. I rate this higher than Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2, Captain America: First Avenger, Thor: Dark World.",Hulk
833,stefano73,A great undiscovered movie,10,12 April 2005,"Before buying the DVD version of HULK I would have chosen 6.5 or 7 as vote (I'm a Marvel Fan and I was displeased about the different origin of the super hero chosen in the story). But after having watched to the special contents of the second DVD I completely changed my mind. I voted ""10"" because I saw the way Ang Lee directed the movie and the passion he used in it. From the computer graphic scenes and the interaction with the special effects crew, to the music used in the soundtrack. Ang Lee personally looked at every little particular aspect of the movie. Also in the special effects he tried to obtain a REALISTIC rendering (dust, sweat, breaths) and I think that he reached his aim. I'm disappointed in having seen a low average in the votes. Maybe it may look like a children movie, but the plot is very psychological and examines the difficult relationship between father and son.",Hulk

He was all alone, chased, hated and feared but was still standing.For me, when a movie makes you feel worried and really care about a character then it's succeeded. It's sad that the rating is so low (currently 5.5) but who knows, maybe it will be appreciated more in the years to come (just like what happened to Shawshank redemption rating )",Hulk

837,james-mcconnachie3,A missed opportunity,4,27 November 2005,"Don't get me wrong, this is a decent movie. But when I close my eyes and think of what the Hulk could have been the film can't help be a disappointment. My first introduction to the Hulk was in the late 70's, hiding behind the sofa as Lou Ferringo smashed through wall after polystyrene wall and ran about in slow motion. I was terrified! There are some reasons this film was not a classic. 1) Miscast - Bana was too confident, strong and good looking. Where was his angst and when he did get angry it was more like indigestion. I have seen a few Robert Downey Jnr films recently and his demons are never far from the surface. He would be the perfect choice for a sequel and closer to the Bixby mould.2) The Hulk - The Hulk was always meant to be a manifestation of Banner's child-like ID. Pure rage that Banner couldn't show. I always imagined him as a kind of bullying older brother, who has no time for you, but nonetheless will step in on your behalf even though he is disgusted by your weakness. The Hulk hates Banner but this was never evident. In addition, he looked more like a wrestler then a monster of rage. I wanted the Hulk to be frightening with rippled sinew not a big galoot with soft eyes.3) The transformation - now that was silly. It made the TV show look better crafted and the in the movie the change looked like someone inflating a dinghy. I loved the sound of the change in the TV show as it made the hairs on my neck stand up...still does. There was a simultaneously horrific foreboding and thrill as the eyes changed and the sound effect was heard for the first time. Banner and the Hulk were wrestling for control. I wanted it to be more Dr Jeykll I'm afraid. Sometimes lashings of CGI don't cut it. We are often more entertained and scared by what we can't see.",Hulk

839,ollie_myers,Ambitious but ultimately dissatisfying film version of the Marvel comic.,2,4 January 2006,"There are some moments of excitement in HULK, an introspective adaptation of Marvel Comics hero The Hulk. One has the big green smashing machine fighting three monster hulk-dogs, including what may be the screen's first monster French Poodle. But the film's most intriguing scene has the ultimate in human rage fighting instruments of mechanized warfare, represented by several attack helicopters. It is the 21st century battle of the angry man versus machine. But the moments of real excitement are kept to a minimum for too long in this film. Until the final third, the film is overly self-conscious and introspective as if Lee, in trying to bring more to the comic book story, lost the original vital essence. This is a film about rage turning a man into a monster and the audience needs to feel rage or they cannot participate in the experience.Berkeley scientist Bruce Banner (played by Eric Bana) does bio-medical research. He struggles with the fact he cannot remember his early childhood. He gets his clues in dreams which keep prodding him with images from a past trauma which has cauterized his memories of the past. Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) works with him and strangely also contends with her own images from the past.Bruce believes himself to be an orphan, but somewhere close by lurks his father David Banner (played by Nick Nolte and in flashbacks by Paul Kersey). His father did something just awful with biomedical discoveries. We never find out exactly what it was, but it left a legacy in Bruce's genes which when combined with strong radioactivity turns him a pastel green, inflates him like a Macy's float, and allows him to disregard walls and ceilings when he moves his huge bulk around. Betty's father (Sam Elliot) is an Army general. He knows that some powerful, weapon- related hocus-pocus is going on. and the Army has left him in charge of making sure America gets it first.This all sounds like it a little more fun than it actually turns out to be. The problem is the film is so dark and so slow to unfold. It takes too long a time to unravel what the mystery incident was even in a film a langurous 136 minutes in length. In fact, we never actually learn the full story. We never even understand exactly what all the scientific research is all about. Equally strange is why General Ross is given such a free hand to handle the situations he faces in the film. His occasional ineptitude is so obvious that it telegraphs action well before it happens. He also is inept in his relations with his daughter as part of the two dysfunctional parent-child relationships that support the plot structure. Lee maintains a subdued tone, trying at times to be deep and psychological and even verge on the pseudo- mystical. The Danny Elfman score is not his usual fare but neither is it greatly notable.There are at least two questions that the film version brings to mind. Bruce Banner seems to have something like 75 kilograms of mass. He at least triples his volume when he becomes the Hulk. Doesn't this make him rather fluffy rather than strong? Certainly it leaves the question of where he gets his strength.Even more intriguing is the question of how his pants manage to continue to fit his midsection after it expands to several times its size without ripping out the seams. The place where his pre- expansion clothing would naturally be the tightest would be his waistline. His pants would rip first instead of being the only thing that survives. Lee seems to remember this detail in one or two scenes, at one point showing an elastic waistline, but usually he ignores it, hoping it will not be noticed.",Hulk

Spider-man, Daredevil, and X-men have become great movies, but the real gem in the Marvel Motion Picture crown is the Hulk.  This movie really captures the spirit of a comic book.  The cinematography is astounding.  This film provides evidence of how great a director Ang Lee is.",Hulk
841,Sir Kodi,"Long, Slow and Not Green Enough",3,7 July 2003,"The film seemed very long and slow to get going.There isn't really enough action to appeal to me on that level.  The love interest isn't very interesting or fully developed, but at least there is the beautiful Jennifer Connelly.  There is considerable time spent developing the ""back story"" of Bruce Banner's father, but somehow that story doesn't even produce any real drama.  It seems to me that the movie spends too much time setting up for a sequel that I have no interest in seeing.On a positive note, the effects are very good and ""believable"", for a comic book character and storyMy second grade son enjoyed this film, though in retrospect, I don't think it was appropriate for his age.  I enjoyed the TV series, but I would rather visit the dentist's office for 2 and a half hours than sit through this film again.",Hulk
842,jayrob,not good,1,5 June 2005,"I was really hoping this would be entertaining. Instead it stunk really badly. Plot was difficult to follow, it was boring as all get out. My wife fell asleep. Bill Bixby is spinning in his grave!Everyone, particularly Bana, spoke in a dull monotone. Even Sam Elliott, who was so stellar as 'Wade Garret' in Roadhouse, was boring as heck. Eric Bana was as exciting as mayonnaise on wonder bread. Nick Nolte played his Down and Out in Beverly Hills looking character for the umpteenth time.I loved the TV show growing up and this movie was a real downer. Supposedly, the movie hulk is truer to the comic book, but I'll take the TV hulk.",Hulk
843,Jimbo-72,The most overrated flop of recent years?,4,17 June 2008,"People keep referring to this movie as being too introspective, too dark, too brooding, or too thoughtful for the fans. Alternatively it is accused of having too little action for the fans.All of these comments are invalid. The character is brooding and introspective and fans like him that way, especially when Bill Bixby played Banner. Furthermore this 2003 film had tons of Hulk time on screen. Most of it even looked like he was really there, more so than most full-CG characters, and much of the action was very appealing to those of us who love the Hulk.The problems the movie had with the fans were many but people seem afraid to mention them. I ""get"" this film, that doesn't stop me seeing all the things wrong with it. Let's give it a go.Eric Bana: His U.S. accent sounds put-on and fake, and he seems incapable of acting angry. The part wasn't very demanding other than that but that's a pretty key feature. He wasn't the worst actor in the film but being so central he represents the overall trend of bad performances in it.Script: Unnecessary mutilations of canon, such as the Hulk being the result of his father's genetic tampering, are offensive to some of us. Another great example is Bruce liking it when he transforms into the Hulk. This ""release"" is offensive to the traditional Banner's repressive personality. Furthermore the transformation was once described as feeling like all his flesh was cut off with a dull knife and sewn back on with a hot rusty needle. Beyond unfaithfulness, very little dialogue in this movie is really worthwhile (much of it is monologue or unanswered dialogue followed by an edit). Good acting could have saved some of it but that was absent also.Nick Nolte: He has proved himself as an actor and both versions of David Banner (an idiotic, backhanded homage to the TV show?) he portrayed were relatively believable I suppose, but his performance late in the movie, channeling Charles Manson raving about sky-holes, really detracts from the movie. His rant is nonsensical, his presence is virtually unexplained and his exit looked like a take he'd done as a goof when he didn't think cameras were rolling.Editing: The comic-panel idea was novel and worth trying, but it should have been thrown out if that was the best they could do. It pulled you out of the movie. Again, a clunky edit is often used in place of properly written dialogue. A competent editor would have nixed the long opening credits as well.The look of the Hulk: Hulk of the comics is officially about 7' tall. Obviously he's been drawn much larger than that and I'm sure that the official number has changed from time to time. 7' might have been a bit small for a movie, especially for fighting tanks. However, Hulk of Ang Lee's film is over 15' tall at times. Jennifer Connelly sits in his palm at one point. Hulk of the comics doesn't change size as he gets angrier, he isn't 15'+ tall and when he's been drawn in the more simian form portrayed in the movie, his face and head take a very specific form which was utterly ignored in the film to unfortunate, un-Hulk-like results.Story and characters: There was nothing to care about in this movie. The hero has no great tragedy except the mother who is neither introduced or consequential to the film. He doesn't seem to even care much about turning into a monster. His father is just a lunatic for most of the movie, no depth there. Betty cares about Bruce but not enough to actually want to be with him. The main villain is a wormy warmonger who is unsubtle in his sliminess. General Ross is all bluster with no real motivation for his Ahabesque pursuit of the Hulk, and while his distaste for Bruce may have been due to his father, it doesn't play in the movie. The movie ends with a sudden non sequitur fight with David Banner-turned-Absorbing Man (canon? what's that?) in which an immobile Hulk triumphs by inactively inflating dad with his essence before a gamma bomb destroys him. The fight is not well shot, not compelling, not pertinent to the story, and doesn't have a satisfactory ending. Hulk Poodle. Hulk Rat.The worst for last, Direction: Ang Lee may not have come up with all the ideas that formed this film, but he chose them all. He tried to throw away the ""You're making me angry"" line on a character who was begging to be twisted into a pretzel by the Hulk, not someone Banner would have felt any great need to warn. He didn't make the movie deep, he made it try to be deep. But, worse than any decision he made, he just didn't get the character. He took the job but he didn't get the character. However, in close contention with his failure to get the character would be allowing the pathetic final teaser scene to be in his movie, crummy fake beard and all.This movie is atrocious. The only thing it got right was the action, much of which was quite good as I mentioned. Sadly, because of people not admitting this movie was actually badly made, depth and introspection were intentionally avoided (to some extent) when they made the new movie. It would have been nice to see the movie they would have made if they'd solely tried to avoid making another bad movie.Go see the 2008 Incredible Hulk, it's actually pretty good. Support Marvel and don't punish them for trying not to be like this movie. But feel free to e-mail them and ask for genuine depth to Banner/the Hulk in the future. It's the wannabe depth that sucks.",Hulk
844,JMEC,The Hulk definitely NOT family entertainment!,2,6 August 2003,"I always enjoyed the TV series of the Incredible Hulk and after having seen and enjoyed Spider Man with the whole family, we went to see the Hulk, hoping for an equally enjoyable experience of a cartoon come to life. Well - this was definitely nothing like Spider man. If it weren't for the good computer animation of the hulk itself, I would have given this movie a 1 instead of a 2. Far too much time was spent in the beginning on shots of cruel animal experiments in science labs to try and provide ""scientific"" explanations of what causes the changes in the Hulk. A good editor would have cut at least 70% of these scenes. They add next to nothing to the story line and I just found them disturbing, as did my daughter. It doesn't get better from there. You can literally sum the rest of the movie up with: scientist changes into creature, military shooting with all they've got, girl crying, hulk changes back, REPEAT. Completely missing are any of the scenes that made the TV hulk into an endearing creature in spite of his monstrous appearance. The scenes that would have turned this film into a family movie. This is not a children's movie - in fact there is not one kid in the whole movie, except for flashbacks into the childhood memories of the lead characters (Hulk and girlfriend), both of which are awful memories and further disturbing to children.I can't see how the Hulk would appeal to any more than a very narrow section of the population, namely those that get off on techno-babble, destruction, military gadgets, and computer animation. The idea of giving the film a ""comic book feel"", by dividing the screen into different sections showing different images at the same time, also doesn't work - it's only confusing. If I hadn't read about that part beforehand, I certainly would have been left wondering what the heck they were up to with the split screens.My advice - if you're looking for family entertainment don't waste your time and your money on the Hulk. In fact this is not even a movie I would rent.Unfortunately with this one the producers missed a great opportunity at another hit - too bad, since that's what the Hulk could have been.",Hulk
845,ebert-8,Masterfully adapted from a comic,9,21 June 2003,"At what part of watching a movie adapted from a comic book causes some people to forget that it is ADAPTED FROM A COMIC BOOK. It is not supposed to be believable.  Ang Lee doesn't even try to make it any thing else, and thankfully so.  From the opening credits the audience is pulled into a fantasy world that is bound by the panes of a page.  But this movie isn't some mindless summer popcorn seller; it is a film that wants you to feel the hero's pain.  This film succeeds both technically (CGI, sound, editing) but also but also from a solid script that tells a solid story.",Hulk
846,^Mask^,Nice show but rather slow..,7,20 June 2003,"I just watched this movie in cinema yesterday and it basically was a nice show that you have to watch if you're a CGI-graphics fan or a major Marvel fan.Personally, I felt that the movie was a bit slow in pass and that would at times make you doze off for a few seconds. Also, the CGI-graphics were occasionally a bit too obvious.Enough negative comments. I thought the movie overall was worth watching and I really enjoyed the camera-techniques used in this movie. Their approach was a bit like done in a comic and comparable to that done in Spider-Man (2002). The story-line was also interesting at some points, but what seriously still puzzles me is: How does Bruce Banner still fit in those pants after he changes into The Hulk?? Hollywood is amazing, I tell you! ;)",Hulk
847,bomblade,"Just awful, simply awful",1,22 June 2003,"Contains spoiler Way back when, a comic book was written about a giant, green, rage-filled monster known as The Hulk.  Now this comic wasn't brilliant, it was maybe a little too far fetched, especially in terms of what The Hulk was capable of doing.  Later, they adapted this comic book character into a television show.  The show, by many standards and opinions, including Stan Lee, was better than the comic book.  There were some problems with the show though. It lacked the action you'd want in a Hulk show.  The Hulk wasn't on enough and they just didn't have enough super villains for this super hero.  Now there's a movie.  You'd think they'd take the aspects of the comic that made the comic successful, along with the aspects of the show that made it so good, and combine the two into an ultimate movie. THEY DID NOT! What I saw, was a very cheesy, poorly written, childishly directed, and with a CGI Hulk, that looked about as real as Shrek.  They could have just hadShrek running around in this movie, and it would have looked the same. When I saw the trailers, I figured I'd dislike the movie.  CGI Hulk looked terrible, and I could tell that the plot and origin were not going to be anything like the show and not like the comic book as well.  When I saw the movie though, I was able to just accept that The Hulk was a cartoon in a live-action movie.  I was not able to accept the orgin and poor story-line. The movie ended up being worse than I figured it'd be. Nick Nolte's character?  What the hell?  Could they have maybe defined what his motivation was?  Did he want to kill The Hulk, use The Hulk, be The Hulk, make love to The Hulk?  They sure did a bad job making it clear, and it changed throughout the movie.  Why was The Hulk's size so inconsistent? Bullets bounce of him?  He gets bigger when he gets more angry?  Since when? He was over 20 feet tall, which means he was about 2500 pounds, at least. His ability to jump 3 miles, is not only against the laws of physics, but just plain silly.  The Hulk can't be hurt, so why not kill him when he's in Bruce Banner form? The ending was crap too.  They decide to have Nolte's character become some shape shifting creature, who becomes whatever he touches.  Cool.  He becomes a rock-man, a water-man, and he battles with The Hulk, for about 5 minutes at the end of a rushed movie.  Total rip-off. The directing.  I'll first say, I thought Crouching Tiger was crap too. Of course, I didn't read the manual.  Was his vision supposed to be impressive? Trying to make this film into an actual comic book on screen is a bad idea. It takes away from the drama, the action, and makes the movie look like a 5th grader directed it.  I have seen reviews of this movie, and they all do nothing but praise Ang Lee's directing, yet, I really don't see what they thought was so ground breaking or effective. The two positives.  Some of the effects were good.  Unfortunately, a cartoon was creating these earthquakes and explosions.  The second is that I got to look at Jennifer Connelly for 2 hours.  She also put in the best acting performance in the movie.  I don't think she knew she was in a Hulk movie, but rather figured it was a love story starring Eric Bana. Overall, I dislike this movie the more I think about it and hope it can't even break 100 million.  I rated it a 2 on imdb and would give it a half a star.",Hulk

I can't believe a studio would actually release this drivel.  But on the other hand, the name ""Hulk"" is the what sells the tickets to jerks like me.

But 5 years after I first saw ""Hulk"", and I still hate it. Here's why:1. Took too many liberties with the origin. I've been a comic reader for years, and this disgusts me to no end. In the comics, what turned Bruce into the Hulk was a gamma bomb. Now, I'm not saying that we needed a shot for shot remake of the original comic, but Bruce had powers (or some form of them) since birth and never noticed for approx. 20 years?! Give me a break. 2. Not a real villain from the comics. His father never was the Absorbing Man, don't try to make him into one. 3. Hulk Poodle? Yeah, there were dogs, including a poodle, who were given Hulk strength. Ugh. 4. This is a movie, not a comic book. I will admit, it was bold of Ang Lee to try and make this as much of a comic book as possible, including moving panels on the screen. Noble try, but it failed. 5. Not enough action. This is a super hero movie, give the big guy a decent villain fight. 6. Hulk's size. Was it just me, or did the Hulk's height seem to vary? Sometimes I wondered why King Kong was green, then I remembered what movie I was watching again.This movie is a disgrace. Thank god the remake came out last year. I'll admit, The Incredible Hulk wasn't amazing like Iron Man or The Dark Knight, but it was WAAAAAAY better than this.Take my advice: If you want to see the characters of Bruce Banner or The Hulk, either watch the TV show (which I'm told is good, I never saw it) or watch The Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton. Or, go out and buy a comic book with the Hulk. Be careful though- Loeb's current run of ""Hulk"" is no better than this movie. Both blow big-time baby chunks.",Hulk
850,VariedMovieCollector,Cream of the Crap!,9,28 October 2006,As super hero movies/comic conversions go for me The Hulk is the best. The Hulk is not an all out action flick of any description by my standards but a detailed description of one man's struggle with what he does not want and does not understand.The movie is so deep and visual in almost every scene and sense. The colours in this movie are flawless with unbelievable shots of scenery and events when they unfold in their own superbly pulled off climax. The acting is impressive to say the least especially by Nolte. He really shows what he is still capable of in this movie given the chance and (as i can guess) motivation.I'll put my future kids in a vice here and say this is a must see for any movie fan.,Hulk

He gave one of the worst performances ever as Bruce Banner. And so did everybody else in the movie for that matter.I couldn't of cared less about any of the characters.The plot was awful.

852,LRPhillip,Finally a comic book movie done right!,10,29 June 2003,"Ang Le did pull it off. This was both a human-interest movie and a superhero movie. He paid homage to a 60's comic book hero. Some may think that there is excessive time spent on Bruce Banner and Betty but the hallmark of the Marvel revolution in the 60's was the greater emphasis on the human side of the hero. Some comics had more interesting story lines when the hero was not in his tights or purple pants.I went to see the Hulk with reservations. First he was not one of my favorites--Spiderman held that role. Second, his angry destructiveness could be a turn-off for a date. Third the trailers made the Hulk appear computer generated and not lifelike.To my surprise, I enjoyed this movie more than Spiderman. This movie had a strong human-interest component. But the real strength was the use of split screens. So often, the screen took on the appearance of a comic book page with panels showing views from different perspectives.My date identified with the Hulk in spite of his destructiveness and computer generated nature. Despite the impression left by the trailer, he really did appear to be human with emotions crossing his face.",Hulk

The Hulk from the TV series???I have to tip my hat to Sam Elliot and Nick Nolte who really stole the show. Elliot did the best job because sometimes you wanted to hate him and then other times you understand and even feel bad for him because he does what he has to do even though he may not want to...The movie has great cinematography in which it occasionally splits into 2-3 rectangles to give you the feel that you're watching the comic book... It really is a cool experienceTo close this out I have to say that comic book movies are getting better and better and have thankfully not gone the way of Bat-Man where the fight scenes looked more like a dance than a fight.

859,cmcavoy,Well Worth the Wait (and Hype),10,20 June 2003,"SPOILERI had a chance to see a preview showing of The Hulk on June 19th, and having been a Hulk fan since childhood, I must say I went to the film with a high level of expectation.  I was not disappointed.Ang and Stan Lee (no relations I'm sure) have produced a film that delivers everything a hulk fan is looking for:  action, cool transformations, and a CGI-creature that exhibits both unbelievable strength and a child-like soul. Eric Bana's performance as Bruce Banner was very original and well done, which is not easy given the huge shadow that Bill Bixby cast from his work in the TV series.  He gives Banner several dimensions as a character, and expresses the true Jeckyll/Hyde aspects of the man; showing moments of great restraint, but always eluding to the dark layer underneath the skin.  In addition, Nick Nolte and Sam Elliott also deliver excellent portrayals in their respective roles, rounding off a very strong cast of characters, and breathing life to a story who's roots come from sheets of colored paper and print.The most remarkable accomplishment of the film, aside from Lee's wonderful choice of cinematography (using a format that highly resembles a comic book layout), was the Hulk itself.  I cannot say enough to the credit of both Lee and the CGI engineers who designed the creature.  To their enormous credit, and my enormous relief, they did not design a creature that was too ephereal, or not of this world.  In watching it, you are able to suspend disbelief and give in to the idea that this creature was there. They maintained Bana's resemblance in the face, which gave credibility to the ""incredible one"", but moreover they designed a creature who shows emotion, sadness, contemplation and of course, rage.  In short the Hulk had a soul, and you not only relate to him, you side for him.  You care for him.I recommend this movie highly to any true Hulk aficionado, and to new Hulk fans who get a chance to see this story live on a screen for the first time. Ang Lee has done a tremendous job with this bit of comic legend, and this is by far the best of the super hero movies I've seen.",Hulk

So naturally, I was eager to see Ang Lee's treatment of my favorite character. On the surface, it would seem that you cannot do much with a character like the Hulk. Here you have a big green guy who goes around smashing things. How can anyone make a good story out of that ?Well, it would seem some people have managed to do just that notably Kenneth Johnson, Len Wein and the writer-of-writers Peter David. Unfortunately with the treatment delivered by Schamus and Lee, this audience member simply doesn't buy it. When I was a kid, the one thing that would intrige me the most was the transformation. Unfortunately when Eric Bana finally manages to get green behind the gils, you get the most uninspired transformation I have ever seen. The plot is average to poor. Some saving graces from the performances of Nolte and Elliot, but Bana as the main character is somewhat lacking in representing the tortured soul that is Bruce Banner. Schamus and Lee seem to have missed the point of the Hulk being a tragic character. The creature seemed to have no soul whatsoever.If you want to see a good Hulk movie, get the DVD release of Kenneth Johnson's 1978 classic. This pales in comparison.Four out of ten stars.",Hulk

The two grow closer as the film progresses, the comic backstory is ultimatley releaved, and the Hulk smashes a great deal of military hardware.  Sounds fine on paper, but the film has problems, and quite a few of them at that.The presentation of the plot and backstory of the film is needlessly convoluted--not that it is difficult to decipher or guilefully woven into the fabric of the film's timeline, its's just presented in gratuitious flashbacks and uninspired, cliche dialogue.And while the film means to slowly build up to its climax (where the infamous Hulk does indeed 'smash' a great deal) in a lengthy early segment, it ultimatley looses the audience's interest as opposed to creating anticipation.Moreover, Seeing a taciturn Berkeley scientist's internal struggles is just uninteresting--no one who likes the Hulk likes him (or it) because of its/his Bruce Banner side (the film's called ""Hulk,"" not ""Bruce"").And while the film's focus may be detracting, seeing what looks Gumby on steriods and speed trying to pass himself off as the Hulk is just outright dissapointing.  The special effects look remarkably artificial given the status of the film, and there is absolutley no realistic sense of gravity or momentum.  While other comic book movies have adapted the famous garb of superheroes to fit contemporary tastes (hence, Wolverine in X-Men does not wear a degrading neon yellow spandex jumpsuit), ""Hulk"" is apparently too cool for school in this regard.  The Hulk is, just like in the comics, bright green and adorned in magic purple shorts; this just looks unnatural and overly-cartoony.And finally, the end of the film is little more than a set-up for a sequel. This not only offsets the pace of the film, but also seems EXTREMELY presumptious on the part of those involved, especially considering a sequel will probably never be made given the film's modest box-office intake.As you can tell, I really, really did not enjoy this film.  It is melodramatic, redundant, unenvenly paced, and unfullfilling.  I encourage all who reads this to skip this fruitless cash-cow save the $8.75.",Hulk

863,iridium_ionizer,"good visuals, but slow; worth a watch in the theatre",7,26 June 2003,"The strengths of this film are its 1)impressive visuals, 2)good acting, and 3)a little bit of fun action. It's weaknesses are mainly tied into its story: 1)excessive details, 2)slow pacing, 3)lack of audience identification with main characters, 4)convoluted final action sequence, 5)lack of comicbookesque peppiness, and 6)lack of screen time for action sequences.
That said, I would like to elucidate my reasoning. **SPOILERS AHEAD**PROS1)impressive visuals: The comic-book style transitions hit me in a good way. The other visuals were great too, except maybe for the tree-moss motif being overdone.2)good acting: Overall great, the scene at the end with the lights was a little overdone.3)a little bit of fun action: I found the action satisfying.
CONS1)excessive details: Why did we have to see his origin explained several times over? Why couldn't they have left out the whole crazy dad part, except for the origin?2)slow pacing: Seriously, it took 45 minutes for him to first turn into the Hulk.3)lack of audience identification with main characters: Sure, making the protagonist emotionally distant may make him more real, but how are we supposed to root for him? They could have made the motivations behind Bruce and an antagonist (a clear-cut antagonist) clearer and less complicated. I believe it is possible to make a tormented soul still be liked by audiences.4)convoluted final action sequence: The dad should NOT have changed into anything. This just cheapens Bruce's own powers, not to mention the havoc it wreaks on the carefully built scientific background. I would have found the army just dropping the bomb on him more satisfying than this.5)lack of comicbookesque peppiness: If, as mentioned in 3), the motivations were clearer, the plot could have been much more fast and upbeat. Plus there could have been a lot more jokes and gags, especially in the fight sequences. They could have made the Hulk say silly things that have a deeper meaning. The audience I saw it with didn't cheer or laugh at all during the movie. That is a problem for a comic-book movie.6)lack of screen time for action sequences: Why couldn't he have discovered all of his powers more slowly? Perhaps clearing out a biker bar or something to show more hand-to-hand fighting before he starts jumping. The dog scene was great except for the poor lighting (and its tie to the dad).
Finally, its a comic-book movie we are paying to see some super-action fun, not a slow, emotionally unsatisfying story. I felt like I was tricked into seeing an second-rate art-house film. Maybe there was some kind of culture-gap between Ang Lee, audience expectations, and the reality of this film. Still I enjoyed it on the big screen. I don't know how they will squish some of the scenes onto DVD.",Hulk
864,jgwalt,"This movie blows, watch the trailers and be happy.",2,22 June 2003,"Warning: Take your Dramamine before watching this movie. I think Ang Lee was trying to give the movie a comic book feel with a lot of corny 1970's fades and slides and picture in a picture shots, but all he accomplished was to make this movie extremely painful to watch. That alone was not enough to kill this movie, but all of the lack of action was. They turned the Hulk into a wimp! Somehow they made a movie about a 15 foot ball of green testosterone into a some kind of cheesy chic flick about psycho-babble (i.e. psycho-babble, sins of the father, repressed memories...etc.).

Perhaps the scriptwriters couldn't decide on how to finish out the movie so they went into the desert with some reality altering substances decided to put it to film.

And after watching it, I also knew that the viewers' opinions would vary greatly. There would be the people who appreciated the tale told to them and wanted to fall into it.

But then it started to go downhill from there. For about half an hour I was seriously thinking ""My goodness, Lee's really lost it."" Then as soon as the Eric Bana and Nick Nolte's relationship started to pick up, I thought; ""Exactly what I was looking for.""The action of course was unbelievably fantastic. I found myself sitting there for a few moments drewling at the special effects. Even though at some points the Hulk did look slighlty cartoonish; what can you do, when you have to apply an emotive face and expressions along with a giant green muscle man?The final interaction between Bana and Nolte was brilliant. It was so much like a tragedy; it looked so much like a tragedy infested play, and that was perhaps one of the great factors which drew me into the movie.Overall, I believe that what grabbed me was how different this film was to others. The comic like split screens, the freeze frames; all of this was brilliant. What makes this film good, is just how different it is to others, as well as other comic book films. I give this film 9 thumbs up. No just joking.5.523432569875233345/6",Hulk
874,bunny_tz-1,Ant look into Hulk,9,9 March 2008,"After almost five years after the debut of Ang Lees ""Hulk"" i feel almost confused by the IMDb rating and the criticism that surrounds this movie, being not what i expected is still far from what should be reasonable to give when you come to face with ""The Incredible Hulk"".In one hand we have this legion of angry fans always moaning about the somewhat shallow movies that are being made about their childhood or adulthood comic heroes and on the other hand we have also a legion of confused professional reviewers and critics that, lacking better words to define their knowledge of Ang Lees ""Hulk"", don't know a thing of what they are talking about. So we are left with a three-handed-monster and the base to its existence it is of course to believe in the words of ""Marvel"" fans with one inch of guts in their fingers to write and post a mimic play of what should be the work of professional reviewers mind and hands to do.So, why this three-handed-monster balance when coming to face this movie? Ultimately, Ang Lees ""Hulk"" is without any kind of doubt the best comic hero novel export to the big screen and a minor masterpiece, standing on its own amongst any fantasy movie exploit that we can think of, and i dare not to say any names. It has balanced player setups, being the acting of both Mr. Eric Bana and Mr. Nick Nolte nailed with believable performances, and the others left with still this incredible effort of Mr. Ang Lee to assure every character is available to the viewers analysis because there is actually content to be watched and processed there, and not only one more name to fill up the plot. When it comes to plot ""cuisine"", this movie is completely delicious and goes where most movies of other genres baring thriller insignias aim to achieve but fail to complete. It has a very simple and linear way of get there, sure we are talking about a comic hero movie, but it nails the motive and the essence of the story that its being told to the viewer, never trying to inject any false pretensions of what is going on inside the movie and of what this movie is all about: the story of how ""The Incredible Hulk"" came to exist, in a way you wont find in any other movie of the genre and you wish you could find in hundreds of other movie genres.",Hulk
875,chazbo1970,Simple-minded Americans beware! Good movie warning!,8,9 July 2003,"There has been a typical American reaction to this film.  ""Too much talking!""  ""Not enough action!""  ""Boring!""  ""Why does it take so long for the Hulk to appear?""  You want to be wowed by mindless special effects, you pay your money to not have to think for two hours.  It should come as no shock that the next weekend after Hulk opened Charlie's Angels was the number one movie.  Now that's the kind of movie Americans want to watch. A nonsensical plot, terrible dialogue, even worse acting, but plenty of eye candy to keep a big smile on your face throughout.  You all sit through the Matrix Reloaded oohing and awing over the fantastic action scenes, when the rest of the movie sucked (don't be fooled by the meaningless psychobabble of the Architect, the Oracle or Morpheus).  You should have known that Ang Lee doesn't create that type of movie.  If you bothered to watch any other of his movies (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon excepted), you'd probably be just as bored.  Lee is a director who puts some thought into his movies, and there's a whole lot more for you, as the viewer, to think about than just wondering when the next action sequence is going to come along. Ang Lee has done a commendable job in making this movie, bringing his very different perspective to the superhero genre.  And while the film is certainly not perfect, it is still an engagingly cerebral take on the Bruce Banner story, and it's deserving of more credit than it gets.  So the next time you pay your 8 bucks to see an Ang Lee picture (and I'm sure most of you never will again), don't assume that it's time to shut down your brain for a while and be entertained by nothing more than a series of high-tech effects and images.  There are plenty of other directors out there willing to make empty, action-packed films about comic book heros.  Fortunately, Ang Lee is not one of them.",Hulk
876,desker513,Not For Movie Lovers,2,25 June 2003,"If Anyone has any sense of quality movies...they will agree with me in saying that the Hulk was the greatest disgrace in movie history bar none......Mr. Lee turned a once in a lifetime chance to make the greatest movie of his career and destroyed it. I admit the Split scenes technique was expiremental but should have not been used in one of the most anticipated movies of the year. The Story was too long to make sense and most of the dialoge was unnecesary, the plot was too large, the CGI's were too dramatic and exagerrated, and the entire ordeal at the end with the father turning into an energy lifeform was way over the top and a despicable way of bringing in more useless fight scenes. Top Ten Worse Things About The Hulk (but not all of them)1. Bruce Banner was not well protrayed...not by the acting mind you, but we comic book readers know that bruce banner was a loser who wore a white coat and glasses....the Bruce in this movie was neither of those. 2. The Hulk should have been about The Hulk's conflicts with the army and the army alone...The father should have been left out. 3. The Hulk was to small and too weak in the movie. 4. The entire ordeal between the general and his daughter was completely useless and added nothing to the movie. 5. The Split Scenes were so horrible and placed in the most crucial parts of the movie that it made the movie feel more like a comic book.. 6. Bruce was (in the movie) disturbed by his past experiences with his family and showed very little signs that he was outcasted socially. 7. Too slow in the beginning and too fast at the end....Mr. Lee does not know how to space it out. 8. The Hulk fighting the Dogs?? Come on....need i say more? 9. None of the original Music was used in the movie!! i was waiting to hear the Hulk theme but never did. 10.

879,laundry_ca,Go Green,8,26 December 2008,"Ennui, not Ang Lee, was likely the reason this movie was poorly received in its theatrical release. Stan Lee's writing insures that the film remains true to the tone of the comic book. Ang Lee's direction pays homage to both the comic and the television show of the seventies, which seems appropriate, given that the mise-en-scene and themes of that decade often factor into his films. The barren desert settings, the militaristic theme and the journeyman malaise of a protagonist forced on the lam, however, were, perhaps, not so very thrilling for audiences accustomed to Hulk's more cosmopolitan, superhero counterparts. Banner's anger--the trigger of his superhuman abilities--is raw and immediate. As such, his situation is far more tragic, desperate and, oddly, closer to average human experience than that of Peter Parker or Bruce Wayne--two fellas who, having less violent internal conflict, have more time to court the ladies in between bouts of masked neurosis. It is easy to see why general audiences, seeking or expecting complete escapism, may have balked at this picture--the films main conflict; so grotesquely instigated by the narcissistic, elder Banner and so violently played out between parent and progeny, is particularly stark for a fantasy film. Familial disaster strikes amidst the constant striving of the middle-class ethos: this is not only a theme that makes Hulk compelling, it is also one that Ang Lee explores in his more serious films, thereby insinuating himself as an auteur.",Hulk

I like the idea of the Hulk, but never read comics or followed the storyline with any interest.  I did watch the TV show when I was a kid when big Lou Ferrigno played the huld and loved it.  When I heard it was being made, but the hulk would be animated, I said to myself ""I am not going to see this animated, therefore very cheesy mockery of a film"". Then I thought after seeing preview after preview that maybe it would at least be worth seeing on the big screen.  So I went to see it, with very low expectations.  From a comic standpoint, I can't comment b/c I don't care for comics all that much, but from a sheer entertainment standpoint.... WOW! I loved the action sequences, and how powerful they were (I am big on strength, size, and power... and this movie shows them all).  It did get quite slow in some spots and the last 15 minutes (minus Nolte's performance at the end) I could have done without.  But for 25-30 minuted, the incredible strength that computer generated character had on the screen more than satisfied me.  To sum up, if you are into this comic book/stan lee stuff, you might like it or you might not... If you just love sheer power and excitment that isn't nearly as cheesy as you would expect, go see it. You might be suprised!",Hulk

886,piranhahead,A Modern Day Geek-Tragedy?,9,30 June 2003,"When I went to see Hulk on it's opening day, I had a lot of mixed feelings. On one hand, I was extremely excited to see one of my all-time favorite comic-book characters finally hit the big-screen. With Ang Lee at the helm of this incredible story, and such accomplished actors such as Jennifer Connely and Nick Nolte, how could it go wrong? I loved the idea of a relatively unknown actor like Eric Bana playing Dr. Bruce Banner, and to me, CGI was the only way to portray the *real* comic-book Hulk (the Hulk is supposed to be a huge scary monstrosity, not a body-builder in green paint and a stupid-looking wig).On the other hand, I was nervous. A comic-book geek like me could be traumatized by a highly publicized defamation of his childhood hero. A lot of bad buzz was going around before it's release... that the bad CGI made the Hulk look rubbery or like ""Shrek on steroids"", that the comic book panel-like transitions are overused, that the movie is a boring confusing mess.... so I was prepared to watch my favorite, most profound fictional characters in history become a pop-culture joke equivalent to that of Kevin Costner's ""Water World"". I read interviews with Ang Lee where he admitted that he knew very little of the actual ""comic-book"" Hulk, but knew how to make a ""Greek tragedy"" (?). I just hoped it wouldn't *be* a tragedy. The marketing was heavy months before the Hulk's release which suggested that the Hulk would be a watered-down cartoony fun- for-all-ages flick easily digestible for mass consumption. So, prepared for anything, I watched the movie unveil itself to me and a sold out theatre.Hulk was by far one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Where as Spider-Man was more of a kids' themed movie, Hulk was definitely for adults (there were times parents had to carry their children out of the theatre because the Hulk scared them so much). Even the Hulkless scenes kept my interest, and all the actors in the movie did a fantastic job. The actual Hulk was a flawless CGI creation matched by nothing else, and I honestly couldn't tell in some scenes that he wasn't real. *SPOILERS AHEAD* I thought endowing Banner's father with the Absorbing Man's powers was a brilliant idea, symbolizing what his father indirectly did to Bruce his whole life... taking everything away from Bruce, desperately trying to steal his powers the same way he tried to steal his life and the ones he loved. *SPOILERS END*Some complain that there isn't enough action and there's too much drama, but I thought that it was perfect. The movie Hulk isn't as much about ""Hulking-out"" as it is about Banner's conflicts from the things he experienced as a child with his father, and how his repressed emotions all came out after his Gamma accident. People actually commented that there wasn't enough ""funny jokes"" in the movie... as if a story about man who had been abused by his father and mutates into a monster as a result of his repressed emotional trauma *should* be filled with ""funny jokes"". The ending becomes a bit confusing, but for those like me who can appreciate a fantastic metaphor will love it and prefer it over a simple ending handed to them.I'll admit, though, some of the comic-panel transitions were a tad overdone. It distracted me from being involved with the story and temporarily pulled me out of it. And sometimes it didn't seem that some of the characters made smart choices (the military allowing Bruce's father to visit him ""one last time"" was a bad move, Talbot zapping Banner with a cattle-prod while in a small room to get him to Hulk-out wasn't too bright). But even with these minor flaws it's honestly all forgivable. The movie is fun and thoughtful at the same time, which is rare, especially for an action-packed special- effects heavy summer blockbuster. It's definitely one of those ""either you love it or hate it"" films, but I can proudly say that was one of the greatest films I've ever had the pleasure to experience.",Hulk

I always loved the comic books, and with the visual effects capabilities now, I thought this movie could be really good.  That being said, I want to point out that the reason I even gave the movie a 6 rating was because there are a couple really cool scenes.  If not for those two or three scenes I would have really felt ripped off.Visually it was absolutely stunning.  I couldn't have asked for more.  I also thought the acting was just fine.  Unfortunately though, the problem was that Ang Lee tried to hard to make too much out of the film.  It seems like an eternity before anything even remotely exciting happens.  I found myself very bored all the way through and just waiting for the Hulk to re-enter and create some havic.  Not to mention the movie felt really long, and the end climactic Hulk versus bad guy scene is a big let down.  With the exception of the few cool scenes, the other audience members started to leave, and yell things.  So obviously I was not alone in my feeling.  I think this movie will start off well at the box office, because of all the advertising, and then come crashing down.  If you need to see this movie, it is a movie that is good to see on the big screen.  I just hope that someday someone can really do this film justice, because this wasn't it.",Hulk
889,Newtype_Maikeru,The First Blockbuster and the Biggest Blunder of the Summer,1,25 June 2003,"I am not sure what Ang Lee was thinking here...  I came into The Hulk expecting a movie faithful to what makes The Hulk so appealing-- unbridled rage and anger, with lots of stuff being smashed.Imagine the look upon my face when I realized I spent 90 minutes waiting to get into the theatre and expecting a cool movie...  And then getting by far one of the most plodding and boring superhero movies ever made.To start, we get a very long flashback sequence to take up the first 10 minutes of the film, displaying Nick Nolte looking only marginally better than his infamous DUI mugshot as he tries to unlock the secret to human superiority -- invulnerability to the elements and regeneration.  Okay, fine, the writers added in the DNA messing-upping that was completely fine and cool in ""Spider-Man.""  I was expecting some Hulk action soon, because I needed something to get my adrenaline pumping-- this is a Hulk movie, and Hulk is all about smashing everything to bits! ...It takes a full hour before the Hulk Up comes, and by then, my interest is waning.  He looks great-- CGI being obvious or not, The Hulk looked detailed, and that's all I want.Too bad you don't see enough of him in the movie all about the big guy. Instead, the viewer gets treated to a convoluted angst plot that seems better suited for a late-90's X-Men comic...  Or a shoujo (girl's) anime.The angst is what killed me-- WHY is there angst in a movie about The Hulk? I don't need psychological analysis of the big green man, and I doubt anyone else does.  It padded a film that should have been 90 minutes of pure adrenaline by about an hour, and it wasn't even good padding.The direction of the scenery was almost a redeeming factor-- Ang Lee is an artist when it came to the comic-book transitions between camera angles, and it was quite the site to my eyes.  Unfortunately, the plot cannot be overlooked in place of the pretty pictures (unlike with most other action movies) in this case, so the movie ends up just suffering completely.Ang Lee should stick to the beautifully-done wuxia flicks, and James Schmaus should be drawn and quartered for his terrible rendition of the legend of the Incredible Hulk.*.5 / ***** (1.5 out of 5)",Hulk
890,rama7,One of the Best Comicbook Movies Ever!,10,21 June 2003,"HULK is an incredible movie.  Ang Lee and Co. have shown that one can have a very serious and intelligent comicbook movie while still delivering revolutionary action and special effects.  HULK boasts the best usage of CGI ever in film and the special effects of this movie are as revolutionary for the times as T2 and Jurassic Park were in their day.  While X2 is a superior comicbook movie, HULK is more spectacular in other departments.  The Hulk himself is simply incredible and a couple of the fight scenes are so explosive that they are unlike anything you've ever seen!As for the plot, direction and the acting?  Well, Ang Lee's use of interesting editing techniques and camera work is pure genius and instantly a trademark of HULK.  The plot and dialogue are all excellent without any cheese.  There were some elements of the story that could've been dropped and a couple of scenes shaved off and the movie would have surpassed X2 in comicbook excellence.  The story has a great deal of psychological depth and the psychodrama adds quite a few levels of depth to all the principal characters.  All the actors are tremendous and do their parts justice. Eric Bana IS Bruce Banner while Sam Elliot and Josh Lucas both give their characters more depth than their comic counterparts.  Jennifer Connelly is great as Betty Ross but it's Nick Nolte who gives one great, grizzled performance.  However, the show stealer is the title character who at times is so life-like, that you don't even think it's CGI.Great film that deserves to have sequels (unlike most so-called ""franchises"").",Hulk

When I saw the movie, I became more interested as to why each character acted the way they do. The action and computer generated scenes were excellent. Overall, I think this movie will be a success this summer.",Hulk
893,traceynjohn,"Big, boring disappointment",4,21 June 2003,"The Hulk didn't disappoint me, really. I went in expecting a bad movie and came out having seen one. The funny thing is, after seeing previews, I thought the CGI effects were going to be too over-the-top and that would be what I wouldn't like. Turns out, the CGI was really well done, but the rest of the movie was slow, slow, slow.There really are many things to dislike about the movie, so I'll just name a few. 1) Character and story development take way too long. By the time the Hulk first shows up in the movie, I was ready to leave the theater from sheer boredom. 2) Although an interesting style, the comic book pane look is distracting and annoying. 3) Too many bad guys, none of which is satisfying. A cranky general, a love rival/corporate type, and a demented father. That's the best they could come up with? I could go on, but why bother...others will undoubtedly provide ample examples.To summarize:If you're looking for drama, you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for action, you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for romance, you'll be disappointed.Rating: 4 out of 10",Hulk

All you have to do is fill a couple of hours with King Kong style smashing! Instead, the characters drone on and on about the most uninteresting and uninspiring details of a directionless plot, and we get to see a few blurry fight scenes.How anybody say the acting was good is beyond me. Not one actor did anything memorable in any way. I've never been so bored.There are fifteen good action minutes in this movie.

896,ring_ruler,Ang Lee forgot he's now in Hollywood!,8,29 June 2003,"First, the CGI (Hulk himself) looks fantastic on big screen. I don't know why people (most of them from online reviews) keep saying he's just a bigger ""Shrek"". Well, he isn't, ILM has once again lived up to the expectations. More of him would be nice, I'd say!All actors in major roles are great. Jennifer Connelly is solid (always looking sexy after all these years!). Nick Nolte is crazy but not over the top, you really do feel for his character. And Eric ""Hulk"" Bana makes a believable Bruce Banner. This is only his second films in US and with Troy next year, we'll sure see the best of him soon.Finally, one thing that so far people haven't mentioned is that the style of Ang Lee, this is where the film being let down. I'm not talking about the ""split screen"" stuffs. It's the constant used of ""flashback"" and ""dreams"" sequences. This is very typical of Asia or to be exact, Chinese film making. You can almost see it in most Chinese drama movies. Luckly, he didn't use the ""slow motion"" which is a fav. of John Woo!What it does to a big action film such as Hulk is slowing the pace of it. It's tedious and quite frustrated to see people keep going back to their past every 5 minutes.If they decide to do a sequel soon, I'd say dumb Lee and go for a more traditional Hollywood type. Ang Lee is a OK director but somehow I don't think he's suitable for these kind of film.",Hulk

And all the 'Great Scene' in the movie has already been played on the trailer. There are no reason to watch this movie at all.",Hulk
899,robert-saunders,It's been said already!,1,19 June 2003,"Well folks,Last night I had a special ""Invite only"" for a screening of ""HULK"" Ang Lee's new film. But, you don't need me to go on about this BRILLIANT Director whose film highlights span from Award Winning ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" in 2000 and other greats like ""Ice Storm"" and 1995's Costume Drama ""Sense and Sensibility"". We all know his work in these pictures has been flawless.Hulk however will show audiences worldwide that EVERY Director has his day and sometimes, you'll release a film like ""Hulk"" and say to yourself ""Ow - I shelled out cash for this?""  To be fair, Ang Lee had a very ""Romantically Enchanting"" story to work with, with large plot holes in the story. So already, the sense you are watching yet another ""X Men2"" or ""Daredevil"" is thrown RIGHT Out the window.The story is VERY Slow and for those expecting an ACTION PACKED film, forget it, this is a strangely awkward slow story of a man whose ""natural life"" is slipping away from him and those who are close to him realise this, as well as Scientist Bruce Bana played by Australian born actor Eric Bana.
Eric's performance leaves A LOT to be desired, and one strong point from his role is his capability of holding an American Accent throughout the duration of the film, which in some cases whilst watching the film the only thing from keeping me from falling asleep. Jennifer Connelly, who does look stunning in the picture provides a rather ""emotionless and directionless"" character, who seems to ""be in love"" with the Scientist in Question ""Bruce Bana"" but far to willing to hand him over to the High Authorities, who (WOW) Surprisingly is Connelly's characters Father in the movie played by Sam Elliott. Elliott provides a rather stable and believable character, but unfortunately IMO is the only one. Another ""mediocre"" performance is provided by veteran actor Nick Nolte, who plays Bruce's long dead father.Awful CGI, Which sometimes will have you thinking you are watching a friend playing a Playstation 2 game and an awfully slow storyline will have ANY fan of the Marvel Comic strip both disappointed and annoyed they've parted with the hard earned for buying a ticket to the movie. Long time fans may however enjoy the Comic strip style split screen which Lee uses throughout the picture to tell the story of ""Hulk"".Perhaps some Lint could be re-arranged on your bedspread? 2/10",Hulk
900,kblank97,Finally a movie that keeps the feel of the original,8,20 June 2003,"I wasn't sure how I would like the ""CG"" HULK before I went to the opening today.  I have to say that, having seen it, it was great.  Using the CG Hulk helps this movie keep the feel of the original ""Incredible Hulk.""If you like the original Hulk comics, you should like this movie.  It even has a comic book look and feel to it during certain scenes.  (you'll have to see the movie)All in all, I really enjoyed this movie.

901,phoenixp3k,"Good movie, brings what you wanted, and more you didn't ask for...",8,20 June 2003,"First of all, the Hulk is an entertainment. It is definitly, the most comic based movie, it includes all that you can find when reading a comic book. Some liked it, others didn't. So Marvel came back with an other baby, but this one is too big not to be considered. The story is a multi-layer plot. It's both a great adventure, but also a search within. You can't take the movie too seriously, they are not trying to make you believe it can be true. They want you to have a nice time. Most of all the visuals were awsome (not only talking about Special FX). The end is ""not"" that satisfying but I rarely saw a movie with a sensational end (let's say it was classic). To conclude... well Ang Lee, gave his personal touch to an all american movie, and gave it some emotions you usualy never see on big screen.

But if you want to escape from the everyday world for a couple of hours and and experience what it feels like to release every repressed memory and emotion in your body - you've got to see this film.It's a fanstastic movie and already one of my favorites.",Hulk

906,chris_539,good movie but not for everyone,8,1 July 2003,"The Hulk was a very good movie that not everyone will enjoy.  This is because of the style of the movie.  It is not just a typical action movie with a weak story, it is a movie that focuses on the emotional aspect more than the physical.  It tries to get into the mind of the Hulk and Bruce himself.  The movie does have some quite decent action sequences with the hulk smashing tanks and ripping apart mutated dogs. The CGI of the Hulk is what a lot of people complained about but it was quite good at parts. One of the strange things was the way they did the scenes.  they made it fell like a comic book in the sense that they had different frames with different angles of the action being played. The power of the Hulk was pretty cool ie. bullets bounce of his tough skin, explosions and high power tanks don't stop him, even a fall from the earth's atmosphere doesn't hurt him. All complaints aside this was quite a good movie but might not be your type.   I give it 8/10 stars.",Hulk
907,mandalore15,A missed opportunity,3,24 June 2003,"My impression of Hulk can best be summed up in two words:  missed opportunity.  This was a chance to tell the origin story of one of Marvel's most popular comic book characters, but instead we get a very talky and slow film about the estrangment of children from their parents.  This film is no Spider-Man or X-Men (or X2 for that matter).  It doesn't try to be, and I think therein lies the problem. When I heard Ang Lee was directing Hulk, I thought it was a strange choice. Lee was the director of the excellent Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and probably the seminal period-piece chick-flick of all time, Sense and Sensibility.  But because it was such an odd choice, I thought it could be something exciting and different.  The result, in my opinion, was definitely different, but by no means exciting. The massive amounts of promotional ads and trailers for the film show us a glimpse of the movie that Hulk should've been -- scenes of the Hulk facing off against the military, the Hulk battling mutant dogs, and the Hulk pounding through the big city.  And to be fair, we do get those scenes in this film and they are quite good.  The problem lies between these action sequences, where we get scene after scene of tedious and sometimes silly exposition with actors who really don't seem to be interested.  I found nothing special about Eric Bana, the actor who portrays Bruce Banner.  He stares blankly through most of the picture, only emoting just before his transformation scenes.  Jennifer Connelly seems equally bored, and shares little chemistry with Bana, her love interest in the movie.  Josh Lucas plays Talbot, a limp and ineffective villain who is about as threatening as an accountant.  Veterans Sam Elliot and Nick Nolte overact their way through most of their scenes, adding some spice to an otherwise boring cast. My favorite part of this movie suprised me:  it was the Hulk himself.  What I had seen of the Hulk in the promotional materials hadn't really impressed me much.  I thought the Hulk looked pretty fake, but I hoped he would work in the context of the movie.  Fortunately he does.  The only time the film comes alive is when the Hulk is smashing his way through one situation or another.  He looks more realistic in closeups than the long shots though. In this era of excellent CG creations like Yoda and Gollum, it seems like the Hulk is a step backwards, but his presence in this otherwise stale film is most welcome. The reason this movie will fail at the box office is because it's just no fun.  I can't imagine the target audience of this movie lining up multiple times to see Nick Notle and Eric Bana discuss Bruce Banner's troubled childhood in endless scenes.  Ang Lee set out to make a ""serious"" film about a subject which demands you cannot be too serious.  The result is a failure. However, the one scene that is pitch-perfect is the last scene in the film. It actually put a big smile on my face just before the lights came up, and made me forget briefly that I hadn't enjoyed myself for the past 2 1/2 hours.  It had that fun magic that the rest of the film lacked.  If there is a sequel, I hope whoever is at the helm can capture that spark and make a Hulk movie people will actually want to see again. My Grade: D+",Hulk

910,Naeriksgurl,Simply Smashing!!!,10,25 June 2003,"I Loved this film!! I felt the drama and character development in the initial 40 minutes was beautiful and very natural in terms of the acting. The performances here are touching and subtle. The tone is very serious compared to other recent comic adaptations and there is alot going on in terms of symbolism and emotional nuance. Everything just seemed very real and humanistic which really appealed to me. Once the action kicks in Lee doesn't forget about the drama tho...and that's a good thing as it is easy to get lost in the scope and fury of Hulk's rages. The big guy looked phenomenal! This is the Hulk form the comics. PERIOD. The desert battle with the army is some of the most spectacular action I have ever seen on film. Everyone turned in solid acting performances but Bana and Nolte really shined. Bana has the most expressive and soulful eyes I have ever seen. He plays the repressed scientist to a 'T' with such subtlety it hardly seems he's acting at all. Nolte is creepy and insane hitting spectral extremes in the same scene without missing a beat. This is a great, great film with something for everyone to enjoy!!!",Hulk

First off the complete lack of a plot. Secondly, you spent half the movie in flashbacks.  How many times did we have to see him under the table as a child.  They could have saved 45 minutes of film easy.  what more, the action scenes were very poor and predictable.  Not to mention, after seeing the advertisments for the movie you had already SEEN ALL the action scenes.

913,MachaSmook,Interesting but flawed,7,28 September 2003,"* Full of Spoilers *For the most part, I thought this was a pretty decent movie. I had no problem with the pacing of the movie, and appreciated the fact that we didn't see Hulk until 45 minutes into the movie. If you think about it, the existence of the Hulk at any moment almost necessitates a halt to storytelling, in deference to sheer spectacle and eye-candy. So parsing out his appearances the way they did was both tasteful and appropriate.However, I don't know why Ang Lee insisted on changing the origin story so much. I would have preferred Banner simply being a short-sighted, scientifically obsessed, severely emotionally repressed gamma bomb designer who ultimately pays a huge price for his monomania. The original comic book was a simple lesson in hubris, and it's still a relevant one.But back to the movie they did make, and how it could have been better:Lee tried to cover too much ground. The film should have been about a half hour shorter. They should have jettisoned the tail end with the father, maybe saving the resolution of that plotline for a sequel. The action should have ended with Banner and Betty hugging on the city street, surrounded by soldiers. Banner could have surrendered himself, then agreed to a devil's bargain of using the army's resources to search for a cure for himself, while they were able to use his data and his body for research to develop military weapons. A perfect setup for a sequel to feature The Abomination.As it is, the film wholly breaks down in logical story-telling when the army allows Banner to meet with his father. Why do they do this? If there is any reason at all, they fail to tell us. Is it simply because David Banner asked Betty to ask her dad to arrange it? She said it was out of his hands, and David accepted that. But then the arrangement is made, apparently just to set up the big face-off between father and son, hero and villain.And finally we see the climactic battle between Hulk and Dad, with astounding special effects that peak with a hovering bubble of imagery over a lake. What are we to make of this? Dad has the powers of the Absorbing Man, a relatively obscure Marvel comic book villain, but has motivations that have wandered all over the place over the course of the movie: Sometimes he's regretful of what he's done to his son and wife, sometimes he wants to conquer death via infinite power, but most times we just don't know what he's about. This makes for an emotional arc that quite difficult to discern, for both father and son.All in all, an interesting but disappointing effort. I'm predicting the studio will make a shrewd turnaround in franchise decision-making, and the second Hulk movie will be to this first one what ""Wrath of Khan"" was to ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" --  less artsy, more kapowee.",Hulk
914,sbiebel,Hulk was bomb!,2,5 July 2003,"I couldn't stand this movie. I went to the movie thinking I was going to see a beauty and beast film with Sam Elliot and the army trying to kill the Hulk, but the film was filled with so many subplots and scenes that made no sense it just became boring and confusing. Add to that Ang Lee split screens during the film. Some will think it cool and looks like a comic book, others will thinks its artistic, but during major scenes where the screen is cut into 4 pieces and action is taking in all areas which do you watch. I only have one pair of eyes. The only saving grace for this movie is the acting Connelly and Elliot and terrific as a strained father and daughter.",Hulk

There were moments and scenes I felt should have been deleted from the final cut.  The movie had been hyped up by the media but when it came time to view it was a major disappointment. It basically was about a lot of scientific mumbo jumbo which hardly anyone understood with a soap opera twist.An actual waste in my opinion.  The plot(if you wish to call it that) was very evasive when you thought you finally grasped the concept of the whole movie another issue reared its head!! Overall not enjoyable movie!! This film did an unjustice to the classic v show as well as the comic strip.,Hulk
916,StarTiger,Here's why I liked this movie?,7,15 January 2006,"I personally liked this movie and here are my reason's why: The Hulk is different then most super-heroes because his battle is a personal one with himself as much as its one with his enemies. And in this movie the major plot is that Bruce Banner just wants to live, not save the world or the city he lives in, but just his own life. Much like frankenstein with the tendencies of Dr. Jekle/Mr. Hyde (which is who Stan Lee based the character on). And in his struggle to stay alive he ends having to protect his gift from people that want to use it as a weapon. Which leaves Bruce in a bind. But the movie to me seems to be 50% precent of an action of the Hulk being unleashed and fighting Hulk Dogs and then fighting for his own survival, not to mention his twisted father and his hungry for power. But the other 50% is drama of this emotionally damaged Bruce Banner with repressed memories and something dark and mysterious brewing inside him. The dynamic between his father and him is one of my favourites, The father loved his son until his hunger for power clouded his love. I liked that memory Bruce had of his father during their final fight. All in all I think it was a great movie.""Your making me angry.... You won't like me when I'm angry.""",Hulk

I would of thought Ang Lee could come up with something better than that for such a big budget feature film.The C.G.I. of The Hulk character is pathetic, two of the major scenes with The Hulk in it are in almost complete darkness (probable to cover up such crap animation).The acting is pretty wooden throughout, but I guess that's to be expected when you act mostly with a blue screen.

I thought TV series was great when I was kid but this is so much better.I loved it and I wanted to see it again immediately.  I just wish there was a little bit more of that crazy hulk; just so well done.  Deliberately cartoonish but so powerful.  The contrast with Dr Banner was about as complete as it could be.The best film of the year so far.  I can't understand how anyone could walk out - I was gripped from start to finish.  This is the Asian take on Superheroes/ Monsters - what a refreshing change from the normal and unxchallenging formulaic offerings like spotty kid Spiderman.,Hulk
921,Patrick__Bateman,Hulk SLEEP!,3,27 April 2005,"It is probably unfair of me to blame the failure of a past relationship on a film, but nonetheless I hold Hulk accountable for the pointless arguing it caused after I convinced my ex to see this this snoozefest.I can't believe how much time I spent apologizing to my ex for my having convinced her to see such a mind-numbingly boring film as Hulk - because admittedly it's much easier to sleep during a boring film than it is to sleep when you're being nagged about dragging someone to see a boring film...All of that aside, even two years later I am haunted by the experience of sitting in the movie completely and utterly uninvolved in the film I was watching. I had expected bad CGI from the trailers, but held out hope anyway...only to have them crushed by the weight of a big, lethargic green cartoon character. The 15 minute-long scene of Hulk bouncing around in the desert was so god-awful I was almost embarrassed for the artists that had spent their time working hard only to fail so miserably. Hulk's fight with the giant dogs was done at night probably in an attempt to hide the poor effects, but it was ultimately only successful in making the scene too dark to know what the hell was going on...not that I cared by that point.The acting...well there's not much I can say about it because actors can only do so much with a script that moves slower than a glacier. Really, everyone involved with this film has done far superior work on other projects, and doubtless their failure here is due to the pacing of Ang Lee. Lee wanted this film to be a serious take on a comic book character, yet the film comes off as simply morose and uninteresting. Call me a fool if you will, but a good part of the $8 bucks I paid to see this film was spent to see a hopefully cool-looking Hulk smash stuff. I mean come on, Ang...this is Hulk, not Hamlet. When the day is done Hulk beats people up and throws tanks around, and when he does it he should at least look cool and not induce catatonia.So in closing, yes I hated this film, because for me it broke the cardinal rule in that it was not entertaining. It was so boring that even my attempts to ridicule it throughout could not keep me from wishing for my time and money back. Needless to say at this point, but my ex- girlfriend was also bored to tears...but to her credit at least she had ME to blame for seeing this flaming dud of a blockbuster.Save yourself the 2+ hours that this film takes in spinning its dull, ponderous web. You've got better things to do, I guarantee it.",Hulk
922,Cadly_dastard,Underrated,10,30 July 2003,"From the opening sequence to the end, this film was not what I'd expected- and it was all the better for it. Although the Hulk action sequences were great, it was the character of Bruce and his relationship with Betty, his father and his big green self, that made me return for a second viewing, a very rare event. It had great acting (esp. Bana and Connelly), pretty impressive CGI, and a few nice, subtle touches of humour. On the debit side there were some clunky lines, several scenes were too dark and the climactic battle was a little rushed and confusing. On the whole though, an excellent film and hopefully time and repeated viewing will do more for its reputation.",Hulk
923,LaVore7,"Really good, if you're in it for the story and the characters...",7,30 March 2012,"I can see why this got a low rating and some highly critical reviews. When you think ""The Hulk"", you don't just expect action, you expectation A-C-T-I-O-N. The very essence of disappointment is failed expectation. And this movie was far from action-centered, although not lacking in the action when it sparked. Man, once Hulk got going, there was no stopping him. No. This was a story about a character, more a drama than anything else, set on the canvas of a sci-fi legend. Interestingly enough, the TV show, that aired for several seasons, wasn't an action-centered show either. But, these days that's all people seem to want, which is why the latest rendition of the film with Ed Norton and Liv Tyler was more warmly praised and appreciated - a movie that I also thought was smokin' hot awesome. But, the director of this movie is not American. He is going to approach every movie with a non-western/non-American perspective. he took the essence of the real story and brought out all of it's best elements, particularly expressed Eric Bana's portrayal of the emotionally tormented Bruce Banner. Like I titled this review, if you want a good story with action as a seasoning to the overall stew, you'll love this movie.",Hulk

Everybody expected something spectacular, at least that's the impression left by the initial commercial on Hulk, but the movie...it's under anything i could of expected.It's lack of story and of good actors it's a real turn-over.All the fans of Hulk accepted it as it came, but the others, the ones that weren't really into it observed it with a more critical eye.",Hulk
926,infinity1248,Worst comic book adaptation ever,2,5 June 2004,"The writing in this movie was terrible, this is what really killed the film more than anything. The CGI made the hulk look like one of those toys that you put in hot water, then they grow really big as it gets saturated. The directing was passable, the acting mediocre, other special effects were passable. Overall, this movie really sucked. I am not saying it is the worst movie ever made, but it is the worst comic book movie I have ever seen, with Daredevil a close second. 2/10PS: I have seen Marvel's early direct to video movies, and many adaptations of comics from independent publishers.",Hulk
927,Curb_My_Enthusiasm,The film gets a bad rap like no other...,10,2 February 2005,"This film is one of the best action films I've ever seen, and aside from Spider-Man 2 and Dick Tracy, this is the best comic book film of all-time. It has incredible characters and emotion, incredible suspense, and thrilling action and special effects. Ang Lee delivers ten fold.As with the original Superman, this film takes a while to set up. But unlike Superman, Hulk's setup is enthralling... Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly team very well with Lee to bring this film's character development far beyond what you're used to in standard blockbuster films.Of course, the action is incredible. Sure his pants never rip off, but who wants to see the Hulk's hulk anyway? I'm just not that curious. It's a sad thing when that's what people find to hold against this exceptional film.The best scene of the film is towards the end, with Hulk running all over, being chased by military vehicles of all sorts. It's a visceral scene unlike any other scene in comic book films. While the whole film is magnificent, this is the scene I always rewind and watch again.Don't believe the negativity. This is an insanely interesting character piece about losing complete control, wrapped in a very expensive, very impressive action film. I recommend this over and over again.",Hulk

WRONG!It's just a jibberish movie with a terrible storyline that it's virtually impossible to keep up with ... and the end - what the hell happened to his dad???? Unless I google it I haven't a clue! And that is why I gave this movie 1/10 score!",Hulk
929,darkartist1977,Slow beginning but good,6,1 April 2019,The beginning was slow. Almost an hour before we actually see the Hulk. But afterwards a good action movie.

931,FoomMan,"Great movie, not to be confused with a Superhero movie",10,4 July 2004,"If you enjoy good film making and the Hulk (duh) then this movie is a blast. DO NOT expect a spiderman-ish, teen-friendly romp with Eric Bana making out with Jennifer Connely. It is a well paced, incredibly well edited, story driven experience of a movie. Bruce Banner is a character you must understand before you can enjoy. He needs the Hulk to act out his inner emotions, which can be seen oh-to easily in the dog fight sequence where his love for Betty overcomes the freedom and power based urges of the Hulk. I loved this movie and am proud to say I bought the DVD the day it was released and saw it three times in theaters.Hulk is a great movie, give it a shot, you wont be disappointed unless you only care for idiotic, stereotypical characters. However, if you are under 12 and/or are impatient, skip the first 45 minutes of the film. Trust me, I had to force family members to do the same.",Hulk
932,hatchchandler,This is a beautiful film,8,12 July 2004,"The Hulk is, with the possible exception of Spider Man 2, the best Marvel Comics film so far. The CGI, though it appeared ridiculous in many previews and commercials, was pretty impressive in a theater. The acting was generally very good, and if the script was at times corny, you have to remember that cheap melodrama is the essence of the superhero genre. The film was beautifully shot, particularly in the Mojave Desert scenes, and the comic book style was superbly emulated through occasional screen division showing a scene from several angles at once. The themes and motifs are not clumsily and overtly forced into prominence as they are in the other Marvel movies. The music, while repetitive, is effective. On the whole, the Hulk is an underrated and brilliantly directed art film/superhero story.",Hulk
933,Chris_Reyno,"If you like the Hulk comic books, you should love this movie",10,28 June 2007,"This movie has received a great deal of bad press and reviews since it was released. I am struggling to figure out what the bad reviews and comments are based upon. To me, this is the ultimate comic book movie.Comic books take time to develop characters and story over a mini-series of books and can take up to a year to resolve a story line. This movie manages to pack in wonderful character development with exciting action sequences seamlessly. Ang Lee truly understands what the term ""comic book movie"" really means and he applied it here with a masterful brush stroke.All of the actors were great in their parts, especially Eric Bana. His simmering intensity as Banner really drove the character in a more realistic direction using repressed childhood memories to trigger ""the change"". Jennifer Connolly was demure and strong as Betty Ross, while Sam Eliott raged as General Ross. Josh Lucas was sleazy as Talbot... just as he was supposed to be. I am not much of a Nick Nolte fan, but he really impressed me in this movie. His performance was totally over the top, but it was perfect for the genre and his role as the villain. To work him in as Absorbing Man really added a personal feel to the story and made the climactic sequence all the more enthralling.Lee's direction was top notch. There were actually scene changes where he added in the sound of comic book pages turning. The framing of scenes in a comic book style helped further immerse me into this fantasy world. His portrayal of Hulk for the CGI effects was wonderful and reminded me on several occasions of a child throwing a fit. In fact, you could see the physical change in the Hulk over the course of the movie from toddler-like to a more mature, adult looking Hulk at the end.This movie took the comic book genre and raised the bar to entertain an older, more sophisticated audience. I was not interested in seeing a ""Hulk smash!"" festival when I went to the theater to see this movie. I wanted to see how they handled Banner's transformation to the Hulk and the circumstances that led to the event. The background given to him by Schamus totally and believably explains how a ""normal"" man could survive being bombarded by gamma rays to become the greatest comic book anti-hero of all time.I have since watched this movie on DVD at least 8 times and see something new each time. It never fails to impress me. There is always something lacking in the latest rash of comic book movies... Spider-Man was never witty or smart-mouthed enough, Wolverine wasn't crude enough... This movie really tied up all the loose character ends and made me care about what happened to all of them.I am proud that Ang Lee had the guts to interpret this story in this way. His movies are works of art and Hulk should be looked at the same way. This is not some big-budget blockbuster wannabe. This is a touching story of a man's fight with his inner demons and his desire to free himself from the beast inside of him.",Hulk
934,sbmaho0,Horrible -- complete waste of time.,1,1 November 2004,This movie is horrible. Do not waste your time. I wish I had those two hours back. At least I didn't pay for it...it was on cable.Acting is lousy. Plot is preposterous. Special effects? I wouldn't know...I was too busy laughing at the ridiculous plot to notice.This movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Can special effects really add anything to a miserable plot? Not in my opinion.I can't think of one good scene or memorable moment from this movie. Most or all of the cinematic techniques are ripped off from other movies/directors. I'd give it a zero.I can't even write enough to meet the minimum length requirement for a review...there's nothing to say.,Hulk
935,AliceSlade08,"Awfule, dreadful wanted my money back!",1,10 July 2005,"First off I had high expectations for a hulk movie. How could you mess it up? Well, you can. The plot was slow and boring, if existent at all. The hulk only looked cool at night when you couldn't tell it was cg as much. Day time shots of the hulk look funny, not scary and hulk like. I found myself constantly looking at my watch and waiting in hopes the movie would get better. It didn't. The use of comic book panels was over done in my opinion, the dialog was terrible, the action was pointless at times and the whole over all movie was just a big waste of my time. I saw this movie with a free ticket I got for buying the video game... and I wanted my money back. I was actually Angery after watching this film because of how poorly it was done.Do you have any clue as to how bad a movie has to be to make me angry? So far only one movie has done it, and its this one. Others have come close. In my opinion, don't waste your money, or your time on this movie. Its best avoided like a plague and it would be even better if Hollywood would forget it was made and let a real director and writer that knows how to make a movie remake this film, with a better plot, script, directing, and effects.

936,lloydy272,A terrible film,1,5 January 2006,"I was looking forward to another great marvel superhero film, perhaps not as brilliant as Spiderman or X-men 2 but good like Fantastic 4 when I bought this. I had heard it had bad reviews and it was slow but I thought what do critics know. I saw it and was appalled. It was boring, with little action and what action their was disappointing. I only saw the film all the way through so that I could say I had seen it and express my views of how bad it is.The film had bad story that was slow and didn't make me care about the characters and just made me think most 10 year bolds could have given a better plot. The direction and editing of the film look awful with ridicules camera angles and a comic book style screen that was a joke.Not only was it a bad film but its science couldn't even pretend to be good. If you watch X2 their (as a geneticist) some big mistakes but you don't care because it is a fantastic film, but the mistakes in the Hulk are not covered up by such a thing. To start off with the opening of the film set in 1966 had someone using a genetic technique not invented until 1975 and that was only the start. I wont bore you with the details but this wouldn't normally be a problem unless the film bored me so much.Bad story, direction, science (even for a sci fi) and I don't think anyone should have to watch this. Just re-watch Spiderman 2 or something.",Hulk

I would love to know how fabric purple shorts fit after growing a number of feet. I thought clothing stops fitting after a Thanksgiving dinner. I think the t.v. show was so much better. I hated that he grew tall it just really dumbed down the film. The film was to long and slow. Boring for kids. The lady lead actress is dull and the only thing it had good going for it was Josh Lucas. Don't make these same mistakes again if the film's producer's are reading this. You have good material, use it wisely. People won't trust you to easy on this one. Hollywood stop making films to long!!!!!",Hulk
938,captneg1,awful movie,1,23 August 2005,"This movie really was what I would call a ""terrible waste of celluloid"" when our economy is so in need of petroleum products. The acting was awful and totally unbelievable. I felt no sympathy at all for the characters, and I spent the whole movie (when I wasn't asleep) wishing for an nuclear device to go off to kill everyone, thus saving the audience from the rest of this stinker. Someone also needs to tell Ang Lee that the multiple split screen went out with the '70's and there's a very good reason why filmmakers don't use it anymore...it SUCKED! Ang Lee also changed the story so much, that I couldn't recognize this from any familiar ""Hulk"" story. Stan Lee should be ashamed for even letting this piece of garbage out to the public. This adaptation was even worse than ""Daredevil' (though not as bad as Joel Shumacher's ""Batman and Robin"").",Hulk
939,VirtualRon,"Good film, but now needs a fun follow up.",7,11 June 2005,"Its not that bad. The CG Hulk is amazing and there are great hulk effects. The screen play is well constructed and the plot well delivered. Overall this is a good film. 3 things let it down. 1. It takes itself far to seriously. 2. There is a lack of emotional depth. This can be pinned on the slightly limp performances of Banner and Connely. 3. The film only really deals with how the hulk came to be, and ends where things might get really interesting. ie when he goes off into the world on is own.Hopefully they will make another and have a bit more fun with the possibilities of the indestructible green man. (and don't make the Hulk smaller so people can empathise with him) I did hear such talk, he's the hulk, your supposed to run from him not think he's sweet.",Hulk

941,grimmxx,"Great film, bogged down by boring, straight-forward people.",9,19 September 2020,"It's a slow-paced story, that tries to make it as realistic as it can, in order to make it a little more believable that somebody can be like this, as well as showcase what they'd go through. As a comic fan, it makes sense to me that Bruce is so numb to what's happening. It was something deep down; repressed. It was always there. It just had no way to come out.The CGI, not only amazing for its time, is still awesome to this day. Actually better than plenty of new movies, that funnel millions more into their projects. Only thing that didn't look great was the villain. Yet the physical effects, when he's shown, are still top notch.If you're a patient person, who actually enjoys movies that aren't typical, you'll enjoy this. It's not a copy and paste superhero film, though I enjoy those too. It tries to add drama, action, and mystery, and does it all well. Really, my only complaint would be the script can seem like a 2000's movie sometimes, and sometimes the acting seems that way too. And it could've delved a little bit more into Bruce's confusion about what he's become. Other than that, always worth a watch. Better than 2008 hulk, and much cooler than the current, occasional, weakling hulk we have.",Hulk
942,osborne-8,disjointed,3,30 October 2005,"People seem to be pretty polarized about the over-abundance of dialog scenes, the lack of big budget action sequences, and the choppy editing.It's clear that the editing, namely the use of split screens and quick shots filled with expository information, is modeled after the comic book medium and the extensive amounts of talking seem to be measures taken to try and establish back-story for certain characters and give them a chance to spout what their deepest idealogical philosophies are but it doesn't work for me.The craving for action sequences and tendencies toward falling asleep are because there's a lack of conflict throughout most of the film. People are chatting about their past, their feelings and their problems and not doing anything about it; it's simply not dramatized. Conversations can be dramatic when there's something at stake but not when it's pure surface-level exposition of feelings and back-story. A lot of folks seem to like the parts where Bruce fights, turns into the hulk and does stuff not only because there are a lot of visual effects but because the protagonist of the story is finally doing something (pursuing character need, taking measures to affect his predicament), not just being passive and talking about things that he remembers happening to him.My biggest problem however is the complete absence of logic about the hulk's anatomy and his abilities. It's a complete break from any semblance of realism. First of all the hulk does not look real at all, his anatomy is hardly related at all to that of a human being nevermind to that of Bruce; it looks and moves like a cartoon and so feels disjointed. Hulk doesn't look like part of the story world at all. Why can the hulk jump 300 feet into the air? (note:I know he's strong but so is an elephant, his muscles are proportionate to his body weight) How can an F-22 fly with a 9,000 lb. hulk hanging from the vertical stabilizers? Why does everything but his pants rip off? As a writer you must at least attempt to address these issues; tell me kryptonite, tell me adamantium, tell me something.",Hulk

944,bice,Bad!,3,21 June 2003,"I just watched the movie last night with a couple friends and we literally walked out of the theater laughing.  Actually, the laughter started about 20 minutes before the end of the movie.-The ending was incomprehensibly terrible.-The main plot was horribly boring and melodramatic. Which was no fault of the actors, the screenplay is to blame.-The departures from the storyline of the original comic were puzzling. The movie could have been much better had it simply followed the original comics. It always amazes me when moviemakers refuse to use the rich storylines available in the comic books.  After all, it was those storylines that made the comics popular in the first place. Perhaps being more faithful to the comics is what made Spiderman and X-men such great adaptations.-On the positive side, at least most of the action sequences were pretty entertaining, which is ironic because I was afraid they were going to be the worst part.
As a comic book fan from years back, this is the worst Marvel based comic book movie I have seen, and that's coming from someone who saw Daredevil.

Although far from perfect and slightly overlong I was pleased that the filmakers obviously took the subject matter seriously. If your attention span can't stretch to 2 hours I suggest you stick to cartoons.I also thought the Hulk was brilliantly realised to look like a mutation between Eric Bana and the Hulk character familiar to everyone.  CGI in this film was 95% convincing and never a distraction, a criticism I felt was justified in the fight sequences of Matrix Reloaded which ended up looking like a video game...",Hulk
947,twomoons,This is a moving comic book.,9,20 June 2003,"I must apologize first for being an avid comic book fan.  My first two comics were Detective Comics featuring Batman and The Incredible Hulk. Two characters that act on their childhood tramas.  While Tim Burton's film was a masterpiece of psycological imagery, dark mood and campy exchanges, Ang Lee (sounds like angry) visually creates a comic book tale that feels like high drama.The themes of repressed memories, the Hulk and Banner always as one, Betty as his blessing and his curse, and the unwillingness to know what lies beneath are all dramatic themes, that belong in the story.  The struggle between Bruce and the Hulk is the ultimate theme of the comics and hopefully this series of films.Eric Bana seems to have a grasp on Bruce.  He is emotionless without being cold.  Jennifer Connally was dead on for Betty, I was a bit afraid of that casting choice.  The fact that Bruce is passionless around Betty, yet Hulk shows tenderness and compassion.  So who is the real monster Hulk or Bruce?The sins of the fathers will be the sins of their spawn.  Sam Elliot and Nick Nolte are amazing in their roles.  The twist on David Banner was quite a nice spin (yes all the sticklers will hate it).  Nolte's performance belongs up there with Willem Defoe as Green Goblin or Danny Deveto in Batman Returns, he walked the fine line of high drama and comic book overkill and nailed.  Sam Elliot plays Thunderbolt Ross just like he needs to play him, single-mined to a perfection.The plot and script, like any sci-fi movie, move fast when doing science stuff and slow down for the human side.  I think the modernization of the plot is fine, and the fact that it pays homage to the original is a lovely bonus.But what about the Hulk?  He looked great, moved great and kicked much butt. The desert scenes were amazing, ahem, incredible.  The action sequences were well played and brought the same joy as if I were standing out side the comics shop reading a fresh issue.Ang Lee has not made a movie.  He has made a moving comic book.  A graphic novel with intense characters and incredible action.  A story that will make you call your local therapist so that you can exercise your own demons.",Hulk

Give me Lou Ferrigno (or anybody else as I would've rather watched Gary Coleman as the Hulk than the crappy rendition they gave us). It was like watching a cartoon character mixed with real settings and real people (think ""Mary Poppins""). CGI can be done much better and we've seen it - just look at the dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park"" or at ""Spider Man."" Even Jar Jar Binks looked more realistic than this garbage! I can't believe they were able to pass this off as a movie. The story is intelligent and the actors do a good job but the Hulk is the centerpiece and he is horrible. Come on Hollywood, take the time to at least make the CGI halfway believable if you are going to use it!

Instead I got what I consider a joke of a movie, the plot was weak, the Hulk looked like a cartoon, and there was very little action.  The movie spent entirely too much time on character development, and not nearly enough energy went into plot development or action sequences.  The two and three way split screen shots make the movie look like a cheap TV show, and the acting and dialogue follow suit.  In my opinion, this movie completely relies on it's CGI ""Hulk"" to put people in the seats.  I wouldn't even say there was a conscious effort to make this an entertaining movie, but more to show off what the film industry can do with computers & CGI.  Oh yeah, and since when does the Hulk fly?  This movie is horrible and the fact that it has already passed the $100M mark is an abomination.",Hulk
952,semiterrestrial,"Pretty, for film buffs. But boring.",4,14 July 2003,"WARNING: There will be spoilers in the following text, but you really shouldn't see this movie anyway.
I did not pay to see this movie. A friend invited me. And that is the only way in which this movie could be worth seeing. If it was free. For everyone. Jennifer Connelly is cute. The actors do a fair job, except Nick Nolte, who really should hire someone to yell ""OVERACTING again there, Nick!"" at a regular basis to keep him from doing it all the time. Eric Bana establishes that he is capable of looking really worried for long periods of time. The special effects are actually not that good. The CGI in this movie is too visible, you notice it's there. All the time. Has Industrial Light & Magic lost a bunch of their good people lately, or could they just not really be bothered? Or are they all working on Star Wars III? Anyways. Hulk basically tells the story of how Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk. Very slowly. In detail. As if trying to explain everything to Mr. A Guy Who Just Landed On The Planet. Oh, and for the movie buffs, there is some pretty funky editing going on. Cool transition effects, but brings very little to the viewing experience, except give you something pretty to look at while you're really waiting to see Hulk smash something, and maybe talk a little bit like Yoda. And when he finally does, it's pretty cool for a while. Hulk fighting tanks is pretty funny stuff. But short. Overall, I rate this movie a 4 out of 10. 2 for the editing, 2 for Jennifer Connelly. So, if you're a fan of either of those, you may wanna go see this, but only go if someone else is paying.",Hulk

I was very pleasantly surprised at Ange Lee's adaptation.  The lead in was great, a must for character development.  Many action adventures are just action no substance. The Hulk developed its characters which made the viewer actually care what happens to them.  The changes in story line which are always unpleasant to older Hulk readers were carried out smoothly.

956,Franknfatz,Ang lee has a unique take on the comic genre,8,10 June 2003,"I saw a workprint, so it's a given that some of the things may not appear in the final version, but overall i enjoyed what i saw.  Ang lee ditches the now typical formula for Marvel films, of flashy effects and more or less mediocre story line.  Instead he's produced a much darker films comparative to the original Batman.  This movie is intensley plot driven, don't expect to see the hulk withen the first 45mins-hour.  Naturally, this bothered me my first time through, but after seeing it a few more times, i appreciated what it does for the antticipation as well as the flow of the plot.  Nolte does a good job of playing banners insane father, which seems to be his forte of late.  One thing i found interesting is the use of multiple frames in a single shot, which i assume is meant to mimic the frames in the pages of a comic book.  At first i thought this was something to do with the workprint, but while somewhat unnesecerry, it helps you remember that this is a comic book story at times when it seems more like a serious drama. Don't expect the lighthearted romp you got with spiderman, or the painfull experience of daredevil.  Lee delivers a mysterious, dark, and at times depressing film deserving of your $7-$9...and yes, the hulk does smash alot of stuff, and yes, it's boss.",Hulk
957,ikhan,Best FILM that happens to be based on a comicbook,10,22 June 2003,"Ang Lee has done it again.  He's a taken a very distinctive genre and recreated it in his own way while keeping the enduring and beloved essence intact.  HULK is not the best superhero movie ever.  That title belongs to X2.  But that's because HULK is NOT a superhero movie.  This is a greek tragedy/intense psychodrama/adrenalin-rush all rolled into one.  This is the first comicbook movie that, when it shows us psychological drama or emotional trauma, it's serious and heavy without being cliched or pretentious.  Ang Lee uses symbolism, metaphors, and allusions to connect the themes of repression, identity, and consciousness.  The use of comicbook-like-panels editing is amazing and is going to be very distinctive of HULK from now on.  The acting by all parties is exemplary especially the title character himself, the Hulk, who looks amazing and somehow totally believable.Now that I've mentioned all the bits about the psychological and dramatic depth of the movie, you might be saying, well, it's a Hulk movie!  How about some HULK SMASH!  Well, when the Hulk shows up, you get everything you could possibly want from a Hulk movie.  What I really loved about the movie was Hulk's fighting style. This is what the strongest creature that ever walked the planet would fight like! Raw, messy, and brutal. Anything he can grab, he can break. Most action movies go for a sanitized fight choreography ala Matrix Reloaded which was pretty much punch-kick-block-jump-REPEAT in every single fight. X2 had Wolverine/Deathstrike which was bloodier but still pretty theatrical. However, Hulk fighting was anything but pretty. Heck, at times it seemed like the movie should have gotten an R-rating and that's only because we associate cheesy martial arts with fighting nowadays when it comes to action movies. The Hulk taking on the military was also awesome. Did not look choreographed or monotonous at all.The Hulk also had very realistic way of behaving when it came to approaching his enemies and what not. The attitude and savagery was displayed not only in his actions but also in his movements, his facial expressions, and the way he carried himself.  Great stuff!",Hulk

959,zosh2000,A film as misunderstood as the monster,9,28 July 2003,"When you advertise a film staring a green monster, ripping apart a city and tanks, that is what you expect in the theater.  The only problem with the Hulk is it doesn't deliver on that count.  But with a superb script, and performances, the film makes it up to the smart and intelligent viewer. Another connotation associated with the Hulk is that it's based on a comic, and that comics don't have serious themes, and adult situations. The Hulk proves that wrong as well.  The film is a blockbuster of another breed and quality.  The Hulk is also not the stereotypical `Superhero.'  He doesn't quip one-liners, laugh at his opponents, or get the girl in the end.  He is just a force to be reckoned with.  It was blasted by many critics and average Joe movie goers because of the bad advertising.  It's a shame the producers of the film couldn't make a trailer that reflected the serous nature of this film.  Ang Lee has crafted a masterpiece for senses if you're willing to give up a little bedlam.  The action seems even better sense your somewhat starved for it.  Plus allegations of poor effects are wrong; the Hulk lives and breathes in this film.",Hulk
960,myrddin99,"Decent movie, fantastic hulk, a sequel free from the burden of backstory should be better.",8,29 December 2003,"This is a decent movie. Not a great movie, but a decent one. There are some areas of contrivance (Bruce who doesn't have any memory of his parents or his life before they were taken from him just happens to work with and just broken up with Betty the daughter of his fathers boss AND he works in the exact same field in science as his father) but I always say that if you're thinking too much about this kind of stuff while watching an ""entertainment"" movie like this then you're just thinking too much. That being said the movie does try to be serious and put more into it than just entertainment so perhaps it asks for this level of analysis. The biggest problem this movie faces is the same as spider-man and xmen faced (and dealt with more successfully). Back-story. How do you get all the backstory the fans love into the movie and not just have it turn into a big exposition movie which relies on a sequel to allow the franchise to really shine. Hulk goes about this in an entirely different way than Xmen and Spider-man did. Those movies kept the title characters right up front and made the movie about them. You learned about the backstory in XMen via small scenes and conversations that were not central to the plot of the movie. With Spider-man the backstory was the movie but it was very much inline with the comic and the theme of the movie was straight out of the comic and centered on the title character. In Hulk the protagonist is not The Hulk, it is Bruce Banner. The Hulk is something that happens to the protagonist as part of the events of the movie. Although he takes more of a center stage towards the middle/end of the movie he is never really the focus. The focus of Hulk is the theme of the movie. The title character is a side effect of the theme rather than the theme being a side effect of the tale being told of the character. Basically the focus is inverted from that of the comics which focus on The Hulk and use him to tell the story or theme of the issue in a subtle way. In the film the theme (rage) takes center stage. Rather than having to look into the actions of the Hulk to see the theme you almost had to look beyond the theme in order to see the Hulk! The best way I could put it is: Instead of making a movie about the Hulk which had a message they made a movei about a message which had the Hulk in it. Which I think was the mistake that drew the ire of the fans. While initialise disappointed with it the movie has grown on me with each viewing on DVD and is now one of my favourites (admittedly mainly for the last 3rd - which is when the hulk comes out for a long play). Hopefully a sequel will be made (the film WAS profitable) and there will be more of a balance between Banner and Hulk (and possibly even more Hulk than Banner). If they make the focus more on the Hulk and make the theme of the movie more subtley told and not so upfront I think they will be more successful.",Hulk

963,sandman30528,A very fine film,8,31 May 2006,"""Hulk"" is an interesting film and one that is hard to put into a box. Luckily, you don't have to. It is beautifully and simply photographed by Fredrick Elmes. I marveled at the lengths Ang Lee and his writing team went through to give us a believable story with just the right touch of comic-book flare. The ending result is a pitch-perfect script, although a very quiet and cerebral one. Perhaps the scenes of whisperings and silence help to make the carnage of the action sequences all the more fantastic. Some do not like the film, I think because it does move at a slow pace and is not so accessible to the general public's attention spans. It's plot also does not follow the normal conventions of American action/sci-fi films and I think this tended to alienate some viewers. I was engrossed by this quality because I truly didn't know what would happen next in the story. Despite the initial negative reactions I think this film will be remembered in the future as one of the best comic-book adaptations from this era.",Hulk

It has been done by a serious director in a serious way and, in the most part, pulls its off. This in itself is a rare thing making a movie about a 15 foot green giant serious. There is no humour in this movie, it takes itself very seriously. As others have said, the performances are all very good - perhaps too good. I think in the most part this movie has trouble getting an audience. Because there is no humour and the emotions dealt are very 'adult' the kids get restless whenever the green giant is not on screen. And for the adults, well they didn't come to see Shakespeare and for them to accept this as serious cinema might be hard for them to admit - even to themselves. The acting is great, the CGI is faultless. But the subject matter could do with lighting up and the editing could be a bit sharper - knock maybe a good 45 mins off the top.",Hulk
965,ken_yukawa,Ang lee is the Albert Einstein of Scifi,10,5 April 2007,"Anglee is one of the most intelligent people in the industry and hulk is his best work till date. It has the psychological factor that no other film has not even AI or Clock work orange or 2001 Heshows that hulk is not just a comic book. He shows us the world where hulk is for real. He discourses upon the change in the society and the individual if the hulk were to exist. Not just the society , he explores the very psyche of the characters of Bruce banner and David banner and studies their minds in freeze frame and in detail as they progress from the beginning to the end. He also explores the nature of father son relationship in the context of a ""power obsessed "" yet intellectual father who analyzes and describes the society in detail without euphemisms and a son who views the world as good and works to make it a better place to live through science in spite of his poverty. The characters are 3D in Anglee's mind . Tf these characters were to exist in our world then characters like Talbot and Ross would automatically spring up. It seems like Anhlee has this little world in his mind where all laws of nature are valid and he is god in this little world and then he introduces his characters and the world changes in accordance with these laws and then he shoots all the changes in detail and shows it to us in the form of a film It is like best thought experiment since Albert Einsteins' when he discovered Relativity. Not only that there is a disturbing distortion in the film which gives the surrealist feeling of ""truth with out logic"" and ""More real than real"" and reminds us of Stanley Kubrick. It is a shame that people didn't receive it well. They seem to hate intellect and art - that raises man above himself .... art that frees man from the bandages of emotion and causality. Will I don't care what people think . I hate human beings and their mediocre folly of hypocritical intellect. It is a shame that filthy commercial capitalists (what more could be expected of them) have appointed an unintelligent , lowly hollow worshipper to direct the sequel. I wanted Ang lee to direct AND write the screen play fro the sequel with complete creative freedom. Then we would have seen what true work of art would have been like.

Ang Lee does a masterful job in lifting the characters in the Hulk off of the comic page.  He has exquisite vision in character interactions as well as the incredible action sequences.  As far as the main characters, Eric Bana has great acting talent, and he shows it.  The American movie newcomer will see many great roles after this.  His character analysis was excellent and his choices were evident.  Jennifer Connelly (Betty Ross) fits her role very well as the long time friend of Bruce Banner.  She gives a believable performance and connects very well with her co-star onscreen.  The supporting roles were also well done.  I am not much of a Nick Nolte (David Banner) fan, however he delivered a poignant performance.  Sam Eliot (General Ross) made a good counterpoint to Nick Nolte as well as Connelly.

One mans struggle against the beast within himself.Be warned this is not a film for kids, anyone under the age of say 15 will not like this film. Also if your a cheap main stream junky then I suggest you go and watch Armageddon or some such other tat.

971,sanjayss-03744,Under rated movie,8,20 September 2020,"I came in to write the review after watching the movie again after 16+ years and seeing just 5+ rating for the movie. I read in 1 review that it got some bad press...dont know what that was but this movie might not have got good reviews coz it doesn't fit completely into any genre...not even dark movie genre. That said the storyline where a father risks his child's life by experimenting on him and then tries to kill him on seeing the dire consequences is a deeply emotional topic that only few would understand. And the desperate struggle of that child when he grows up and fights and tries to come to terms with the raging being within him..the rage against humanity and what greed has made humans into is something relevant now as well as since ages.
Another big draw for me was the background score which I remembered since more than 16 years back when I first heard it.
The VFX is top notch and I had heard from a friend who works in the industry that it took batteries of very high powered computers to generate many of the fight scenes.

972,stephen-sondheim,So it's not spectacular...,5,18 October 2006,"Ang Lee knows what he's doing. Can we all just agree on this much, at least? He defies genre. He comes with a strong vision, and he gets results. He's done it with every project, and ""Hulk"" is no different.This movie is not perfect. Far from it. On the whole, as a matter of fact, I'd have to call it average. The second act is overwhelmingly slow and riddled with flaws. The CGI is laughable (even for CGI, which let's face it, is usually pretty laughable).But Lee does a better job than any director before or since at capturing the visual ""feel"" of a comic book. There are bold choices - double POV shots, insets, moving frames. He makes a real effort to make the movie LOOK like a comic book, and I don't think that he gets enough credit for what he did visually.Also, the acting corps puts across some very good performances. They're a somewhat weak group, working with lackluster material, but they rise to the challenge, and the performances across the boards are better than the material warrants. Ang Lee steps it up here, fighting against overwhelming odds to put across a good final product.",Hulk

They didn't do that in this movie, so from time to time the characters jump from one side of the screen to the other, and appear to be looking every which way.Someone should be embarrassed.

976,trolleywood,"When he loses control, I like it",9,24 June 2003,"Alright, I just saw the Hulk, and I personally thought it was better than Daredevil and Spiderman put together! Ang Lee does an incredible job presenting the Hulk as a real person with real emotions. I have heard complaints about how long the movie was, but I believe it was necessary in order to develop all the characters fully and to believe in all the conflict that is going on between the chracters, especially between the overbearing parents and the young scientist children. My friend even told me that he didn't like the movie because, ""It took forever to see the Hulk.""Although this movie may not be the typical marvel action movie i.e. Spiderman, it makes the transition smoothly because the Hulk was never a typical superhero. He was more the Mr. Hyde to Bruce Banner's Dr. Jekyl. Fans expecting to come in and see the Hulk during the first 10 minutes will be sorely disappointed. The film takes its (much needed) time to explain what happened to Bruce and why he would be so angry. It explains why the Hulk would even come out in the first place. All in all the direction was great, with the split screen sequnces which gave the movie a comic book feel, the acting and characters were believable, and the movie was a great delve into the mind of a man with a tortured past. There is little comic relief and the movie plays out more like a drama with the Hulk in there to take care of Eric Bana's (Bruce Banner) more violent scenes. I appreciated the psychological delve into the mind of the Hulk and appreciated the character developement on all sides.

980,ajsarte,"Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" is a singular masterpiece of the super-hero genre",10,29 June 2012,"I know the current ""Avengers"" movies are popular right now, and everybody digs Mark Ruffalo's version of the Hulk (myself included), I still consider Ang Lee's 2003 ""Hulk"" to be one of the finest comic book based movies ever, and contrary to popular belief, one of the most faithful. Being a true fan of the Hulk comic stories from the 60's to the 80's, I think I can say this with credibility. I'm also coming from the angle that the 70's TV show is not the real Hulk. First, Ang Lee's film is extremely faithful to the comics. Watching the movie, it was as if some scenes were lifted right out of the Stan Lee stories. Hulk fighting army tanks in the desert, Hulk leaping over canyon cliffs, Hulk touching the reaches of space, and yes, even Hulk dogs are from the comics. Hulk's father in the movie is directly based on Bruce's father in the comics, Brian Banner, who was abusive and allegedly had a hand in Hulk's origin. The many villain incarnations that David Banner takes on at the end of the film are not just the Absorbing Man, but are an amalgam of many of Hulk villains including Zzax.Second, Ang Lee's film was less about simply ""Hulk Smash"" and more about the idea of the Hulk. The idea of evolution, the idea of repression and subsequent freedom from that repression. It's interesting that every Ang Lee film is similarly about this idea of repression. Repressed gay cowboys, repressed women in China, a repressed slave finding freedom after the Civil War, etc. The evolution idea is expressed in the food chain of ""Hulk"" creatures we see in the movie. First a frog, then dogs, Hulk himself, and then a near ""Hulk god"" in David Banner. Evolution is also cinematically expressed in the morph edits seen throughout the film. Contrary to popular belief, the multi-frame editing was not just about mimicking a a comic book, it was about expressing the idea of freedom from repression, of seeing something from different angles, different points of view, different sides, much like Bruce has a ""different side"" to him. If you notice, the multi-angles many times show us the same subject but from a different camera angle. The idea of the Hulk is also metaphorically visually expressed through the imagery of atomic mushroom clouds and jellyfish, two visually similar objects. It expresses the idea that this Hulk was born of two of the greatest known forces in the universe, genetic and atomic force.It's Ang Lee's masterful filmmaking, strong use of visual metaphor, and faithfulness to the original comics that really sets his Hulk film apart for me. Perhaps the one scene that really spells out what Ang Lee is doing and also brought me back to the old comics was that first close-up we see of Hulk free and jumping through the desert to the haunting Danny Elfman music.

But, why is that a bad thing? There are too many films out there that offer non-stop action with no discernible story line what so ever, catering to the TV fed ""30 second"" attention span generation, leaving the rest of us frustrated to be bombarded with an endless tirade of generic action films that rob each and everyone of us out of $8-10, two hours of our lives and another failed expectation. I can honestly say that the Hulk was not what I expected. It exceeded my expectations. Finally, a film where the story was given precedence over CGI and explosions and not vice versa.Many had expressed dissatisfactions over the CGI, expressing that it was too ""fake"". One question? How can you make a 15 foot, muscle bound, invincible green monster look ""real""? Plus, I can honestly say that the CGI are the last thing I care about when I see a film. Too many films have been ruined because the concentrate more on the CGI than the story itself (Jar Jar Binks anyone? No? How about Jurassic park 2 and 3? Still no?). Plus, the CGI were quite nice and sublime and went beyond what I had expected them to look based on what I had seen in the trailers.A film is a medium used to provide the audience with a visual narration of a story, not a two hours computer graphics demonstration. The Hulk provided me with an entertaining story, the CGI were just pleasant window dressing, and for that alone, I can honestly say that the Hulk was both time and money well spent.",Hulk
984,dazdrew,Could Have Been So Much More.....,5,20 July 2003,"When coming out of this movie, I had a strange sense of impatiality as to what I'd just seen.  For me it's a definate mixed bag. Plus points are:- 1) Ang Less direction - excellent as ever,and as covered in other posts, the inventive editing, multiple angle shots, fades, wipes etc capture the comic book essence of the movie perfectly. 2) The HULK - Most of the time the Hulk looks fantastic.  Certain scenes really made the character look as lifelike as I could have hoped. 3) The Acting.  Bana, Connely, Nolte and the supporting cast do a more than adequate job here.Unfortunately, the Bad points ultimately let this film down badly for me. 1) The pacing - far too slow for the majority of the first half of the movie.  Sure character development is important, but not at the expense of dargging down the pacing of the entire movie, surely?  Far too often (at least for a big summer action\drama movie), you're feeling the movie d-r-a-g real bad, and are waiting for something to grab your attention. 2) The HULK - Bit of a contradiction to my comments above I know, but generally while the CGI HULK looks fantastic, this is let down by the odd scenes where he stinks - and stinks real bad.  The ""Foam Trap"" scene in particular, had me scratching my head (after I had been initially very impressed with the look of the character). The Ending - Over ambitious and completely unneccesary - the last half hour of the film should have been cut, and some of the effects work here is especially far from good - the huge ""bubble of energy"" anyone? 3) Hulk Jumping huge distances looked as ridiculous as it possibly could, and the part where he ""buries"" underground from the river was just plain dumb - both of these points were unnessarry character abilities for me, and just didn't translate onto the big screen.So a straight 5\10 for me - solely for the personal plus points raised above.

I did not mind so much, because I believe an excellent job was done giving background information and depth to the characters before we see the monstrosity at work.

987,pierrotem,"""The Hulk"" deserves more credit than it gets!",9,22 June 2003,"As for all good movies, you simply can't expect to be a passive viewer. The argument is even stronger when you watch a film by one of the few extremely creative and intelligent directors of our time, Ang Lee.  You have to work to watch his films.  If you meet him half way, then you realize how rewarding the experience is.  If you want to be a lazy audience, then you'll complain that ""The Hulk"" is too tedious to watch.  Then don't watch it. But PLEASE do not go around saying that it is a bad film.  Just say that you aren't up for it.  Be fair.So far, I have read over and over again that Ang Lee's ""The Hulk"" is a very confused film.  It may be a 'confusing' film (there is nothing wrong with challenging convention a bit) but it is certainly not a 'confused' film. As a matter of fact, I find it an extremely cleverly made movie.  Lee has managed to take a comic book character (one of the darkest ones, too), extract the tormented essence of the Hulk's character and infuse the entire movie with it.  ""The Hulk"" does not depict a realm in which everything is either black or white, good or evil, it is precisely situated in that twisted, dark domain of the inner recesses of our minds.  That may scare you.  It may not be comfortable.  But please don't shoot the clever fellow who tries to bring it to life on the screen!  He's a brave soul.  Don't judge it on the usual Hollywood dazzle scale and turn away because the film wasn't 'pretty' enough or because you didn't get enough laughs out of it.The naysayers seem to forget that this film is based on a comic book. They criticize that the Hulk looks stupid, like some big ""Gumby on steroids."" Why, because he is big and green?  Well, that's the way the Hulk looks, if you don't like it don't go see the film.  It's not as if the character was created out of thin air just for this film.  I even remember reading a certain critic's article in a highly reputable newspaper making fun of the unbelievable pseudo-science on which the story was based.  Well, it is based on a c-o-m-i-c book, no one said this was based on medical research to be published in JAMA anytime soon.  Get over it. If you have no better criticisms than that, well, you are obviously trying hard to dislike it. People criticize the CGI, because they feel it looks fake.  Well, film is a constructed realm to begin with.  And honestly, does anyone know how a 'realistic' Hulk is supposed to look?  Isn't that a contradiction of ideas? I think the CGI work in The Hulk was the perfect fit.  It had enough 'unrealistic' edges to add to the comic book feel that the entire film was working so hard to capture.All in all, ""The Hulk"" is a good film.  It may not be easy to watch. There may be moments when you're not too sure what to think.  However, it is definitely worth the ride.  Keep an open mind, sit back and just enjoy the show, will you???",Hulk
988,vmprspike,Excellence,10,20 June 2003,"I saw ""The Hulk"" on opening day, like I do for all Marvel Movies. I'll admit that, even though I'm a huge Marvel fan(atic), I was a little doubtful about this movie. I had seen the Super Bowl Trailer, and was a little disappointed, but I was (Thankfully) proved wrong. Ang Lee has done a wonderful job directing this movie, he has included cut-a-ways that just make this such a great comic-book movie. The CGI Hulk was impressive, the one part that I didn't fully believe he was real was his first transformation, he was too bright green, I think. Other than that, think ""Cave Troll"" from ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" but improve on that technology about 100 times. A very well done movie, I will definitely be seeing it again.",Hulk

991,Menonr,Arthouse meets Blockbuster... BIG MISTAKE,1,21 June 2003,"Ang Lee dazzled us all with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. He showed us his flair for making a good arthouse film. Unfortunatly The Hulk, made to be a big summer blockbuster, is trying very hard to pass off as an arthouse film. The dialogue, the cinematography, and even the actions just scream it. But then all of a sudden you see a large action sequence, destroying the flow ofthe film. THe movie doesnt flow. The dialogue, in an attempt to be classy, comes off cheesy. Eric Bana was a complete miscast. You just find it hard to believe with him as the Hulk. Avoid this movie!",Hulk
992,jameshannett,Great film. (Possible spoilers),9,4 August 2003,"When I first heard there would be a Hulk film, I just dismissed it as an attempt to cash in on the comic book movie phase in Hollywood. I then heard (well, read) that Ang Lee would be directing it, which I though was an odd choice for a summer action blockbuster film, but it wouldn't really make any difference. I was wrong, very wrong. I heard some good reviews and decided to see it. Right from the beginning I knew it was special. The way the credit sequence fills you in on the back story is unlike anything I've seen before and I loved it (particularly the time-lapse parts). The cinematography is striking, the comic book split screen panels in particular. While not being new (see 24 and Spooks), the way it is used definitely adds to the character of the film. The CGI and other visual effects are well done, even if the idea of a 3 metre tall green monster is hard to believe. The fact that the Hulk is green is probably the biggest issue with believability that I had. There wasn't enough contrast in the skin tones in my opinion, and that the flesh underneath is red (he gets wounded). Anyway, it looks amazing and the transformation sequence looks quite convincing. It's not all looks either. There is some very interesting character development, especially (and obviously) when it comes to Bruce Banner. The dichotomy of Bruce's personality is interesting in the way that he not only repressed his memories of his childhood, but also his emotions and an entire personality. The Hulk is not just the result of a mutation, but all the emotions Bruce has refused to acknowledge. When he says he likes it (the transformation), it's not just the power, but the ability to feel anger and rage once again. My only complaint is that I'll have to wait for the sequel.",Hulk

We return to similar montages, reminiscent of a Nine Inch Nails video, throughout the film.  It takes a grindingly slow hour before we ever get to see the titled star of the film in all his green glory.  In his second scene we get to watch the brute pummel a trio of mutant dogs to death while Jennifer Connelly sits by watching without much emotion -- a lack of feeling shared by the audience.

They second time I watched it, I was quite impressed by the creativity behind the Hulk and action sequences. It left me wanting for more. And that feeling put's you in a bad mood. The third time around, I notice the masterpiece behind the drama, the first class acting, and breath taking cinematography.

I understand where the movie was coming form and I am sure that many will like it but I do not understand why the magic that made Spiderman so great was not included in this film.  In addition, the Hulk is not a children's film and has some astonishingly graphic scenes.

If you're going to make a comic book movie that's entirely dialogue, at least it should be good dialogue. And what's up with all the stock footage? It makes it look like they were running short on time and money making it. AND.. that intro was the most horrible thing ever. The whole movie felt like a really bad 70s sci-fi flick.

The fun excitement of a comic book and also the integrity that I wish to have as a film viewer. I love the art house feel that Lee brings to the movie. Hulk is not like all of the other comic book movies that have been coming out in the past years where they throw the it right in your face.

1002,sankiesh1,A lot of special effects... a lot of plot holes.,5,7 July 2003,"THIS NOTE IS FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY WATCHED THE MOVIE, IT CONTAINS SPOILERS.First of all, I can't understand why, If Gollum looks so real, Hulk can't. I mean, CGI can look great, but some movies just can't achieve the realism. Star Wars is a good example of how some CGI can look great some times but others horrible. Hulk is the example of how ALL CGI can look false and almost laughable all the time.Most of the effects look like a cartoon. Why then make this picture if it will look like a cartoon. Make a cartoon-movie instead! Being edited in squares like a comic is a poor way to get closer to its origins, and moments like the explosion in the deep laboratory (where everything freezes like in a comic book) are completely out of the charts of wrongly used computer effects.But the CGI is not the worst, but the story itself. Is there one? Hulk's father is the worst character, always contradictory, awfully written. He passes from being a good man, a man concerned for his country and family, to be a crazy psycho. One moment he wants to kill someone and the next he refuses, why? Maybe because an action sequence with Hulk fighting sesame-street-looking vicious dogs was ""needed"". Nolte is a man passing from good to evil without a reason. Sadly use of a magnificent actor.Like that ""impossible to find or understand"" reason, we find many more. Why the green explosion at the beginning? Why Hulk's father wanted to kill his son at the end? Why? Why? Why? Many holes in the script, but, like always in Hollywood, ""great"" pointless action sequences. The problem is that, after an hour, the movie starts to be repetitive and emotionless. You know Hulk won't be killed, no matter if you shot him with a pistol or with a nuclear bomb, so where is the emotion?After an hour, I repeat, the movie is about the same and the same. The same Hulk movements, the same jumps, he gets caught, he escapes, he gets caught again... The last sequence, where Hulk fights his father is a truly ugly one, both in the CGI and in the story behind it. I wonder if the night has dramatic purposes or in fact is hiding the unreal images, the most false and boring of all final matches between characters. Spiderman-Green Goblin final match was enjoyable, no matter if it was a common punch fight.
Many action images, many broken houses and buildings, many characters that look like made with ""Play Doh."" NO story at all. Many people say it is full of character drama... Where? Where? I would like them to show me, because the Hulk looking with a sad, false face towards Jeniffer Conelly is not dramatic to me.Years ago, Superhero movies looked fake because of the lack of great special effects. Now, Superhero movies look fake because of an excess on computer generated effects, even the smallest camera trick has some computer effect involved. Hulk is a bad movie and its not-so-great effects do not save it. Ang Lee (who I considered great) was truly disappointing.",Hulk

The movie did perfectly fine with me, and I enjoyed watching Bruce's journey. So many people tried to bring the Hulk down, but he prevailed through it all. Bruce's love for Betty was so strong that he transformed back into human form for her. Overall I believe that no one should hesitate to see the movie, because it is engaging.

It's a good MOVIE first, and good comic book movie second.People are complaining that the setup is too long. I thought it worked well. It's not enough that Hulk smash(!) -- it helps to get an idea of what it is inside Banner that makes Hulk smash.I thought the action sequences did a good job of giving insight into Banner's inner workings. I like the fact that various characters' motives are ambiguous.Kids probably won't appreciate the depth of the film. More than requiring thought, this film encourages thought.

Not even when Hulk saved the Golden Gate bridge from disaster by jumping on the fighter plane. By that point I didn't care about him.Jennifer Conley's talent was wasted on this role.The special effects were just okay. A major disappointment in my opinion. With movies like The Matrix and Lord of the Rings turning out top notch special effects I would have expected a Hulk that looked better than a rubber doll.The first forty minutes of the movie was some of the most boring footage I've ever sat through and had to endure.

In the 3 years I've worked for the movie theater, there have only been 2 movies that were so laughably horrid that I wanted to walk out. I thought The Musketeer was bad, but my dislike of that pales in comparison to my feelings on The Hulk.We laughed at much of it, were confused by more (it never told us anything about the dogs), were bored by too much backstory in some areas, and confused by far to little in others. A few people were actually hitting their heads with their purses periodically through the movie.On the bright side, I've never seen a comedy movie that had as many people laughing so hard as they left the auditorium.If you're looking for a movie that is definitely a comic book, you may enjoy this. If you are looking for the bad comedy of the summer, you will most definitely enjoy this.If you're looking for a movie that makes sense and is worth the money, well, go watch Finding Nemo. Even if you've already seen it, see it again, because it is considerably better than wasting your money on the piece of garbagethat is The Hulk.Nevertheless, the movie did have its good points. It did have some really interesting camera angles, and at points it had the screen seperated into blocks that showed different angles, which I personally liked, though one of my friends found it extremely annoying and distracting.

This is not a man in a rubber suit or a stuffed-shirt super hero hung by string against a blue backdrop.  Movies ARE fake.  If you can believe in little green men, why not giant green men?  The new reality is that computer animation is far more superior to an actor with a 20-million dollar price tag. Trailers didn't do the movie justice. The film has all the story lines working--boy/girl, empathy for a misunderstood underdog, betrayal, villains, mystery and the best action sequences I have ever seen. You can forget TV Hulk Lou Ferrigno. Animators cranked up the volume on this Marvel Comic super hero to an unimaginable pitch.

The CGI sucks, if the Hulk where a cartoon, he would have looked ok, but this is a real movie, and its sad to say that the series in the 70's made a better looking hulk then that classroom full of fat computer geeks.But this wouldnt have been as bad if the story was actually any good...but my god, what the hell was this??!!!!!! First it takes three days before you actually SEE the Hulk, and then it just makes you wish you never saw him, and CERTAINLY not that idiot of a father.And then there is the end, which is to dark, pointless and just looks awfull.After Bombs like, Spiderman,Daredevil,Charie's Angels etc, this is just another megahyped, super expensive piece of crap. the kind that seems to dominate the boxoffice the last couple of years.A couple of weeks ago i saw Jurrasic Park again on TV, and this ten year old movie looks ten times better then all the CGI created 'blockbluster' of the last four summers put together.I give this movie a 1 (the one is for Jeniffer who still looks pretty damn good)PS, try and slip on a pair of pants two sizes smaller, then think of a 15 foot guy wearing yours ??????",Hulk
1012,friar01,Wholly Unsatisfying,4,20 June 2003,"I really wanted to like this movie; I really did. However, at the end of the movie, I felt a little disappointed, even cheated.There is no real ""plot"" in this movie in the sense that there's a concrete conflict that must be solved; rather, it focuses on the character of Bruce and how this beast inside him is aroused. This would be fine had they been able to capture the audience and get them to relate to the main character. Sadly, the opening hour or so of the movie does a poor job of accomplishing this; with the considerable chunk of time devoted to this part of the movie, it should have been able to do so. Most of the back story is told through short, abrupt flashbacks, which fail to get the viewer to identify with Bruce and understand his repressed rage. As a whole, the plot seems disconnected; it seems like those making this movie weren't quite sure with what direction they wanted to go. The ending is rather anti-climactic; while during the final half hour of the movie it seems like the action's building to this great crescendo, it kind of ends with a slight thud rather than with a flash and a bang.You'll hear a lot about the CG of the Hulk in these next few weeks; some people will praise it and some will say it would have been better done using claymation or stop-motion cinematography. Being that we would be seeing a lot of the hulk, it seemed necessary to me to have a CG Hulk that seems as lifelike as possible. I, for one, was rather unimpressed with the CG of the Hulk. The first scene where you see Banner transform is actually very well done, but for the rest of the movie, the Hulk seems rather out of place. It seems to me that the CG was rushed to meet a deadline; whether or not this is true, the CG still seems to be missing a layer of polish that would have been accomplished with a little more time. The scenes where it is dark do not look very bad, probably because you can't see him too well. The worst scenes by far are the ones where you are viewing the Hulk from afar as he runs through the desert; it is here that the second-rate CG truly rears its ugly head. While the CG of the Hulk was not the worst I've seen recently (Scooby-Doo takes that unenviable award in my book), I've seen much, much better (Gollum/Smeagol in The Two Towers, for example).
There are many times were Ang Lee uses multi-paneling in the movie. While this technique works well when used correctly, it seems that this camera trick was used many times solely for the sake of using it; many of the scenes where it's used could have been done without it. One scene in particular shows six or so different angles of a single helicopter landing. I ask, ""What's the point?"" While some may say that it adds to the ""comic-book feel"" of the movie, I found it irritating and even nauseating at times.The action scenes are actually quite good in the movie, and it is fun to watch the Hulk take on tanks and helicopters while running through the desert. While being the strong point of the movie, these scenes seem to come too late to save this movie from falling into mediocrity.Again, I really wanted to like this movie; I'd been looking forward to it for a long time. However, at the end, I felt wholly unsatisfied; this movie could have been so much more.",Hulk
1013,cepnoi,Spiderman vs. Hulk: my vote goes to Hulk,8,24 June 2003,"Spiderman is great but Hulk is greater, even though Tobey is a better actor, and even though Tobey is a better Spiderman than Eric Bana is a hulk.There is quite a difference between the Spiderman and the Hulk: Spiderman changes once, becomes spiderman, and we don't really see much of what he was before he obtained his powers.  We do see how he handles the change, and that's the most exciting thing about the movie: he handles it well, becomes a superhuman while remaining human.  Even if he loses the girl till the next sequel, he still gets a kiss.To become The Hulk takes much more than a spider's bite: The Hulk is a temporary superhuman incarnation, and seemingly does not retain much human from Bruce, it is something different.  To Bruce, ""hulking"" is like a dream, it's not Bruce anymore.  Kissing the hulk does not even occur to Betty Ross.What's even more interesting, is that while while Tobey's character *is* The Spiderman, The Hulk and Bruce aren't the same thing.  The Hulk is more of Bruce's hidden rage transformed into a green monster, and the monster's relationship with Bruce ain't simple.  In one of Bruce's dreams, The Hulk reaches out through a mirror and grabs Bruce in his fist.  Such relationship between the human and the sleeping monster within him is another entertaining aspect of the movie, impossible in ""Spiderman"".Spiderman is about ""with great power, comes great responsibility"", and this concept carries a bit too much moral weight for a Friday night, and resembles something on a junior school's required reading list.   ""Listen up kids, if you've got great powers, you better quit fooling around, drinking and having fun, you better be putting these powers to a good use....""The Hulk on the other hand is about hidden powers and rage darkly shifting within each one of us, dreams that we dream but that never come out, things that happened to us in the past that keep inside and that eat us.  The Hulk is what happens when the rage does come out and transforms us into something entirely else.  Unlike Spiderman, The Hulk is a discovery of things within us, rather than a doctor's lecture on how to handle a spider's bite.The Hulk is also about freedom, about breaking out of the tired and boring everyday life's egg shell and taking a flight and doing things you haven't been able to, and it does not come with a slight aftertaste of being lectured to.The Hulk: A+. The Spiderman: A",Hulk
1014,andygiven_2000,Could have been better,3,19 July 2003,"First of all...the first 30 minutes are the strongest in the entire film....despite a strong performance from Jennifer Connelly the show is a steaming pile of vomit. Ang Lee has tried to make the film more like a comic book than a movie, this frustrated me alot. Ang should have kept it simple. There was no story line at all, apart from the  from the fact the american military trying to be heros. There were scenes in the film that include the dog fight and most of the the hulk running through the desert which were totally unnessicery and the movie probably would have been 30 minutes shorter without them. That would have brought it to around the 1 hour 35 minute mark, more than enough for a film of that caliber. I just wanted to get up and leave but felt compelled to see how they left way for a sequel. In saying that i wasn't missing much. The ending to the film was shot totally in CGI and in total darkness. I couldn't see what was going on. im not sure weather this was the movie or the cinema i was in but everything else seemed to be fine. The only redeeming feature was the ""curious chemistry"" between Connelly and Bana. I don't know weather they were trying to imitate the chemistry in spiderman between maguire and dunst because there are only a handfull of scenes where they both come in contact with each other but these few meetings somehow pave way to creating a more believeable story. Maybe the hulk coming in contact with Betty Ross calmed the animal within him and made him come across as more man than beast. David Banner came across as a weak character helped by terrible dialouge. Noltes acting was alright but due to this dialouge problem he came across as a little bit muddled as to weather he loved he loved or hated his own son.I hope that ""Hulk 2"" creates more of an impact but we can only pray. out of five id give it a Hulk sized 1",Hulk
1015,carrion_comfort,Best Film of the Year.,10,9 June 2003,"Let me start off by saying, who ever posted the review that gives this film one star obviously didn't see the right movie, or they simply wouldn't know a good film if it punched them in the face. This film works on so many levels that it puts even the awesome X-2 to shame. First off the plot and the character development are so incredible and intense that you totally forget that you are watching a comic book adaptation. The tale is brilliantly told and the acting from all is top notch, Nick Nolte's character literally gave me chills. Now as for all of you wonder if the CGI was good, or if it was bad? Trust me it was top notch, and definitely better than any one could have imagined, I can definitely see this as setting a new benchmark for digital characters. You feel the anger and sadness and everything in between that the Hulk is going through, as he has to not only survive torment by the army, but also uncover the painful secrets of his past, face the sins of his long lost father and find his humanity in his love for Betty. Yes, it is that deep and complex. Another thing that deserve mentioning is the masterful direction of Ang Lee and the unique was he filmed the movie in a split screen/comic panel style (think of Fox's show '24'), which allows for a much more intense and personal experience. Also lending to the overall product if Danny Elfman's soundtrack, which is without a doubt his best to date and is very surprising. It incorporates a lot of tribal sounding elements (ala Gladiator) that really lend to the dark and dramatic tone of the movie. So basically, if great acting, superb drama and some of the best special effects I have ever seen are not enough to make you enjoy the film than I guess you just don't have a pulse. To me this IS the definitive comic book film. It does not water down the drama to sell it to little children like Spiderman did, nor does it try to infuse darkness and violence just because it would be cool (see, Daredevil). You see, while I like all of the above-mentioned films none of them really can prepare you for the real, dramatic and believable darkness of this film. The closest thing I can compare it to, even though comparing it doesn't really due it justice, would be X-2, if you took the atmosphere of that film and cranked up everything to eleven, the action, the drama, and most of all the sense of darkness and dread that is there without being over powering, that would be the closest analogy I could come up with. I think people will be surprised and very divided on this movie. They will either love it or hate it, and it is definitely not for the kiddies (not so much for violence, but just for the overall intensity and atmosphere of the film). Lastly, while I am sure a lot of die hard fan boys will balk at the dramatic change to the Hulk's origin, In terms of feeling and raw emotional power, this is a more faithful adaptation than I should have ever hoped for. In my opinion, this is not just the best film of the summer; it is the best film that has been releases so far this year. I HIGHLY recommend that everyone go and see this film. *10 out of 10 stars*",Hulk
1016,davidanthony-706-695990,The Most Awesome Comic Book Movie,9,7 April 2010,"I really do believe the people who reviewed this movie initially want to now eat their words when 7 years later this movie that they called trash turned out to be a complete masterpiece. This movie was made unlike any other movie before it and it was criticized by many who just couldn't grasp it and for a time I was one of those people. What I didn't understand is that this move was not made to be watched only once. And that it had a level of depth to it that at first glance can't be seen. The unspoken words, that are said. The deep emotional reactions portrayed by the excellent cast, who might I add played their roles to perfection. The story and all the interesting ways the director uses different mediums to explain how it all began. This movie is in a class of its own. Not to mention the best use of CG in a superhero movie to date.(Yeah I said it to date) The animations the RAGE!!! the POWER!!! everything was in its place. Ang LEE is a master. If you disagree just watch the 2nd one with Edward Norton. No comparison complete garbage. Oh yeah and I have to get this one in there Ang Lee's HULK was the real HULK. the second one was not. For those of you who don't read comics the HULK can grow to fifteen feet tall and can leap huge distances, who's strength has no limit. Let's look at the strongest men in the world, are they cut and ripped like Body Builders, hell no, so why then is the hulk all 'veiny' and ripped and small in the second Hulk. Ang Lee's Hulk is more convincing and powerful and more HULK than any other adaptation. I think Ang Lee laid a real solid foundation from which to build and Marvel could have used his foundation to surpass even Spiderman. But they messed up with Edward Norton. People went to see part two because of part one and they were terribly disappointed. When we should have gotten more we got less. Less everything. I think anyone who wants to see a real comic book movie should not look past this one. This is an awesome movie that like a fine wine only seems to get better with age. And I am waiting on a real sequel to this movie, and I know that there are many others out there that feel the same way. Get Ang LEE and Eric Bana and the whole team back.",Hulk
1017,jan-corstjens,Comic book adaptation overflow!,7,28 June 2003,"What do we ""realistic"" Europeans expect from a movie like ""Hulk""? We want to see a little drama, nice action and some ""realism"" too. We do know from the start we won't be intellectual challenged when watching it. This project has been waiting on the shelf 'till one Ang Lee decides to take it all the way: the movie has a comic book feeling with all the moving screens which is ok; it works for this one. A strong cast does the job and yes the special effects look REAL to me and many others. Making a giant green monster look real(human)isn't an easy job but it's been done quite well here. I am positive about this movie, but I can't say it's fantastic(see for yourself). Maybe we get to see too much MARVEL adaptations these days, because the logo in the beginning starts to look very familiar... Still good for a nice 7 I believe.",Hulk
1018,smit9590,What a mess!,1,25 June 2003,Most people who disliked this horrible movie thought that when Banner HULKED out that it looked too fake.  I disagree the scenes in the movie when he is the hulk are without a doubt the only parts worth watching.  The story dragged on in more then one part. For such an awesome director and great actors what a horrible movie.,Hulk
1019,NelsonNRG,"Slow start, interesting actions scenes, strange plot",6,27 June 2003,The movie takes for ever to get going but once it does you get some interesting action scenes of The Hulk throughing around tanks and knocking down helicopters. But toward the end the plot kind stretches to a father vs. son battle that really was a stupid idea and not really inline with rest of the movie. -- C-,Hulk
1020,elcubano-1,A thrilling blend of mayhem and human nature.,9,21 June 2003,"(SPOILERS)""The Hulk"" is a very effective piece of work both on it's own, and as an adaptation from a comic book.  On it's own, it is a manifestation of built-up anxiety and over-whelming depression due to neglected emotions and releases for these emotions.  As an adaptation, the Hulk (with help from very cool CG) is realized with radiance and pure, un-tamed power.  What makes the film so good is how these two elements work togethor to create an emotionally moving piece of cinema.  Anyone who has ever lived through a traumatic experience, or built up such emotional stress through lack of proper expression, will immediately relate to ""The Hulk"".Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a scientist whose mad scientist father, David (Nick Nolte) accidentally passed on a genetically altered gene to his son.  To activate the gene, all it needed was a little gamma radiation, and when Bruce sacrifices himself for a co-worker, and comes into direct contact with the gamma rays, the Hulk is unleashed....almost.  More like, the Hulk is enabled.  Now, whenever Bruce experiences moments of extreme rage or depression (mostly brought on by close-minded, greedy folk or repressed memories and emotions) he transforms into the big-green-giant.  But, even before all this happens, we are introduced to his ex-girlfriend (Jennifer Connely), who broke up with Bruce because he was too ""emotionally distant"".  Her father is, coincidentally, the military general who tried to keep a lid on David Banner's work back in the 60's.What amazed me about the film was the massive adrenaline rush that I recieved during the action sequences, when the Hulk is in top gear, and ready to kick ass.  Not only, however, was it the fact that he was about to kick ass that got me pumped, but rather, it was my emotional investment in the character of the Hulk that made me want it more.  Director Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""The Ice Storm"") does a fantastic (if at times hoaky) job of creating the relatable lead-roles through-out act one.  It isn't until act two that we are actually treated to the intensity of the battle sequences.  This method of approaching the film established a certain level of beauty in all the film's chaos.  To explain, when the Hulk is first unleashed from an unbearable collection of inexplicable depression in Bruce, it feels relieving and satisfying.  It's as if the weight that has been lifted off Bruce's shoulder, through his transformation, has been lifted off our's as well.  By the time Bruce has finally transformed into the Hulk, we know and like the character so well, that the very primitive method of releasing one's bottled-up emotions through physical exertion feels absolutely blissful. By no means does this indicate that Lee has pulled a fast one on us, and made violence OK.  Rather, he has captured the feeling of yearning and desire so well, that I would doubt one's humanity if they couldn't relate to the Hulk.""The Hulk"" is, for just this reason, absolutely entertaining.  We know what the Hulk is fighting for.  We know he is misunderstood, and therefore, we feel far more attached to him emotionally, that the level to which we are entertained is boundless.  This is the kind of action film that one could watch over and over again: a) to catch little details in the action-sequences that make them that much cooler, or: b) as a therapudic tool to find something with which to relate.To be honest, I found myself getting quite choked-up during, and after the film. The reason was not because of the tender moments between Bana and Connelly, or other character interactions, but rather, the self-growth that the characters (particularly the Hulk) seem to experience.  The metaphor of a green- fighting monster and confronting one's emotional dementia by way of destruction might be a far-fetched one...until you see this movie.",Hulk
1021,cityodww22,Pretty Good A whole better than Daredevil,7,19 June 2003,"Eric Bana did a splendid job of portraying Bruce K. I mean Bruce Banner. Ross was a tough customer but showed a little heart at the end.  They (producers/writers etc) left the strong possibly for Hulk2; which I would anticipate would be out by 2005.  The CGI was great; I like the fact the Ang Lee's team introduced different versions to the public i.e. Super Bowl Sunday, trailers on the net to see if the 'real' Hulk fans would accept it. I am not a true Hulk fan, so I hope that is a valid statement.  I don't believe the trailer (ad) from SBSunday is the same in the film.  I will leave that open for discussion. Right now for comic-to-movie it's like this in my book:1> Spiderman 2> Blade 2b> Hulk 3> Batman  -- if they stop changin you plays Bruce Wayne... 4> Superman The other film that was released this past February doesn't even belong on the list. Seriously they could of call the movie Electra and it would have done A WHOLE LOT BETTER.... The other ones:  HeMan/Punisher/Capt. America stunk it up! 7.5 out of 10 Gamma Rays",Hulk
1022,puglover0887,GARBAGE!,1,20 June 2003,"The Hulk was the most god awful piece of crap ever! This was two hours and twenty minutes of my life that I want back. I sat there for like an hour waiting for Bruce Banner (played terribly by Eric Bana) to turn into the Hulk. I sat through endless amounts of garbage that didn't have anything to do with the movie when it all added up. I particularly remember two scenes that were significantly horrible: 1) When The Hulk jumps on an airplane and it somehow takes him to outer-space, then he falls to the oceans and survives! HOW DID THE PLANE TAKE HIM STRAIGHT INTO OUTER SPACE?!?!? I have no idea. And 2) He jumped like three states with each and ever leap he makes. The last time I checked I didn't know the Hulk could fly! Another terrible part of the movie was David Banner (again horribly played by Nick Nolte). He served no purpose in the movie other than to be a horrible actor and yet another pointless addition to the already much confused plot of the movie! I will urge everyone I know very strongly to not see this movie, or if they want to see the worst work ever created out of a comic book...than they can go see The Hulk. As for me, MARVEL just lost a lot of trust here!",Hulk
1023,pablo80,so dull,1,29 July 2003,"I had the expectation to see an entertainment movie, I knew I could not expect for a very good one, but at least it could have been some action. You can easily start to see this movie in the second hour, because NOTHING HAPPENS IN THE FIRST PART. Then you will see a mix of a drama and an action movie but with a really awful script. In addition the action scenes are so not attracting that you keep watching your clock until the movie ends. About the performances, I have to say that Jennifer Connelly is really beautiful but she plays exactly the same role as in ""a brilliant mind"", Eric Bana is OK, and so does Nick Nolte, although you don´t know if he is a despaired father or a villian.",Hulk
1024,bheltebr,My Humble Opinion,5,20 June 2003,"OK, so I'll start off saying that I like most everyone involved with this film, so it's not that I'm bashing any of them personally. Basically though this movie is as mundane as can be. It just seems that since there was no push to make him a superhero in the sense that he fights evil for the betterment of the world, there just isn't much going on. Dialogues seem disjointed and conflict seems constructed. Basically it all boils down to a predictable family drama which is more about the Bruce's father than about his Hulk-ishness. I would be fine with this except it was pretty lame. The climax which we waited over 2 hrs for lasts only like 5 minutes and it's hard to even tell what's going on. And, the edits from scene to scene and the frame splits are so annoying. I mean, I understand Lee wanted it to look like a comic but 1. comic panels do not just portray varying angles of the same scene and 2. leave that alone! it's what's great about comics and really can never be transferred to film anyway. I'm not saying it was terrible, that I hate that I wasted my life like that. It was fine, just something I don't care to see ever again. So that's it, I predict it will do well this weekend and then taper off. The onslaught of mediocre comic films needs to stop, or at least they should turn their sights to more complex comic narratives like Watchmen and Dark Knight Returns, unless they're going to butcher them of course.",Hulk
1025,idman2000,What a dissapointment!,8,21 June 2003,Thats basically all I have to say. What a dissapointment. Not that it was a bad movie. It was ok. I just thought they could have done with out the first 20 minutes when they were looking over past events in his life. If they were going to do that dont do it so long. The action scene's and the little cameo by Stan Lee were the best part. But thats just totaling about 30 minutes of the whole movie.,Hulk
1026,luddewho,Ha! Worst movie of the year? No!,9,9 June 2003,"No, absolutely not. I think Ang Lee's version of The Hulk is beautiful to watch and a lot more serious than other new `comic movies'. The sfx/cgi is very well made and does not overlap the story/narration, a common problem in new action movies like Matrix: Reloaded for example. The great music by Danny Elfman is also worth pointing out. I liked it, almost as much as I like spider-man. And almost as much as I hate Dare Devil. The Hulk: 8/10",Hulk
1027,Oogaphlub,Skip It!,1,16 June 2003,"Possible Spoilers AheadGuys this movie is terrible.  The trailers are bad.  The movie is worse. I saw a screening of it, and it is terrible!  The cheesy special effects were bad.  The father/son storyline between the Hulk and His Dad has been played over and over in hundreds of different movies.  This movie offered nothing fresh, and some really corny one-liners.  You will be smarter to put your money towards a more promising looking movie like Terminator 3 that will actually have a story.  The Hulk you could tell was a CG effect, and how else could they do it?  They did the Predator (from Predator) as a makeup costume and it looked totally realistic.  The Hulk here stands out like a sore thumb.  A really bad love story, mixed with cheesy subplots, plus bad CG effects, add some corny action=a Really bad movie.

When the Hulk went ona a rage...he went on a rage! it was a blast, everytime he was beggining to change i would curl up in my seat and got ready to be entertained, now i admit that at times the movie moved a little slow and that little kids will probably not like it much but if your in the mood for a movie that makes you think and makes you wanna smash, the Hulk it for you.",Hulk
1029,ViNaN,A Brilliantly worked film from ang lee and hulk will knock you flying,7,9 July 2003,"""Hulk"" directed by ang lee is a wonderfully mastered film that decides to concentrate on the pain and anguish of bruce banner (Eric Bana. Eric is brilliant as the confused scared and sensitive scientist who darent release the hulk with in him. Connelly is the elegant lover of banner and is equally brilliant in supporting him while they both try to figure what is wrong with him.The basic storyline is rather simple, a scientist named david banner injects a virus into his body which mutates his genes, he then realises that these mutated genes are passed onto his son.  After traumatic family issues and vast exposure to gamma radiation, the hulk is leashed.What makes this film so variably different from other comic book adaptions is that it gets straight in, none of the superficial superheros and villians.  Its ang lees brilliantly created world with the outstanding hulk.Now theres the Hulk, Ive read many user comments that naively slate the cgi of the hulk, however the cgi wasnt that terrible and the hulk was believable, however he was the star of the show, throwing tanks, jumping 200 feet, crashing helicopters hulk ran the film. Lee creates a child like monster that is brilliant on the big screen.the downfalls are that the ending was a bit rushed and the hulk did look a little weird at points.However this is a marvelously crafted film from one of the greatest directors, this isnt just another spin off from a good comic book idea, this is a well worked film that should be one of your must see films for the summer.9/10",Hulk
1030,xiety,HOT! A lot better than expected...,10,20 June 2003,"This movie totally suprised me. Surfing on the internet for the last couple months, I've often heard people saying that the movie was going to be bad, etc. I honestly think it was good. Maybe not good, VERY Good. Instead of following the tv show, it followed the comic book. And please don't believe everyone that says Hulk sucked, because it can't, because it's The Incredible Hulk!",Hulk
1031,Pinky_Brain,A good movie,8,16 July 2003,"Honestly, I thought that this was going to be a failed experiment from Ang Lee, but I was positively surprised when I went to see the movie on the opening day here. Eric Bana plays his part extremely well and the Hulk is visually amazing!!! Ang Lee introduced directing details that give this movie an extra ""comic book"" touch that other movies of the same kind have failed to provide so far. Also, there's a close viewing and exploration of the sentimental and psychological side of the original story. In short, this isn't just another action-packed movie, where we only see kicks and punches throughout the entire movie. I hope there's a sequel and that it'll be better than this one, because there's always room for improvement. Good work, Ang. Congratulations.",Hulk
1032,ReubenClamzo,"This isn't your TV Hulk, this is a graphic novel come to film",7,20 June 2003,"There are a lot of detractors out there complaining that while they never read the comic book, they were fans of the t.v. show. Well, this isn't the t.v. show. It's also, thankfully, not the trailer. And it's probably not going to appeal to everyone.Well then, what is it? It's the most successful translation of a graphic novel (that is, a 'serious' comic book) to film that I've ever seen. The Hulk has never been a dialogue driven story, and this movie benefits from the use of visuals to propel the narrative. Ang Lee has obviously studied the visual techniques of comic books and masterfully applied them to film. He uses refreshingly complex camera angles and transitions scenes through picture in picture comic frames. He achieves surprising depth using reflections in glass and shifts of focus. He also increases the relative impact of the CGI by reserving it only to scenes where it's absolutely necessary.My favorite aspect of the film is the relaxed pacing and emphasis on story telling. Unlike the A.D.D. addled DareDevil, we're given the opportunity to understand and sympathize with Hulk's origin and complexities, without missing a terrific roller coaster ride of action sequences. The dream sequences are similarly thoughtful, presenting metaphors and symbols of Banner's ongoing transformation in surreal images and colors rather than cliche black and white shaky-cam dreams.As I said, this combination of art and literature won't appeal to everyone. People expecting 120 minutes of ""Hulk SMASH!"" will certainly be bored. Sure, there's plenty of action, but it's broken up by too much of this talking and acting stuff to keep them interested. Comic book accuracy nuts will also be put off by the detail changes to the origin and supporting characters. However, people looking for the unlikely combination of foreign film complexity in a sci-fi action film will be surprised and pleased.",Hulk

But when i went to watch the hulk i found that it was set out in a comic format, with multiple screens on occasions and the CGI hulk was absolutely brilliant, he looked life like. Nick Nolte was brilliant to play the father. Along with this movies a hell lot of action and tragedy, a battle for survival and battle for his fathers love. Ang Lee combines the action and tragedy with brilliant sound that suits its purpose. i would highly advise anybody, even if you have never heard of the hulk, to go and watch this movie. this is a powerhouse of a movie",Hulk
1034,Runik,Incredible,10,9 June 2003,This movie so far has been the best I have seen this year. I really enjoyed the build up of the movie . True there is some minor differences from the comic. I don't think any true hardcore geeks will mind the change it seems to fit better with story. Even though it takes about 30 to 45 mins for Bruce Banner to transform into his Big Green Alter Ego the story doesn't seem to slow down and draw on . My interest in the movie was intact from beginning to end and that is really good considering I am easily distracted.

1036,djmoibueno,"The good, the bad and the ugly",6,1 July 2003,"I have just seen the hulk and was quite looking forward to it, although I did approach the movie with a little skepticism after watching the trailer.The good. The way the film is shot is beautiful, the locations, the style of photography, the editing, the use of already existing comic themes to cut and fade left me really impressed. There is no doubt that Ang Lee knows his way around the camera. There are some good performances in there aswell. Jennifer Connelly gave an understated, mature performance as Dr. Ross. Nick Nolte who has had his share of problems plays Banners father with menace and humanity in equal measure and really seems quite unhinged. The leading man playing Bruce Banner was also good and reminded me strangely of Corey Fieldman.The Bad, for everything going in hulks favour, the most unsatisfactory thing about it is there is too much contrast. The movie lurches from an emotionally charged scene to CGI action too dramatically, too many times. Most memorable is from an escape scene to an almost theatrical moment when bruce must face his past. The audience couldnt take Nick Nolte´s speech seriously after just seeing the Hulk going crazy and laying waste to just about everything in site. The movie needed to make up it mind whether it wanted to be a comic orientated summer blockbuster or a thoughtful take on the genre. As I said in this instance I felt it was a bridge too far.The Ugly, for all the speculation after the trailers release what did I think of the CGI hulk. Hmmmmmm, it is really difficult, but now we are all used to digital effects, the hulk left me cold. Yes it was impressive that ILM (i believe it was) induced emotion from the graphic, yes his movement seemed largely realistic. For me it was in the conceptual stage when it went all wrong. The hulk seems half cartoon and half real. It just doesnt work.Summary: Go and watch the hulk, even if it is just out of curiousity, the acting, shooting and editing are worth it. The contrast between reality and the comic are strong and sometimes work well. But overall, try not to laugh when you see the hulk, as half the audience in the cinema did when I watched it. Because after that you just cant take it seriously.",Hulk

The character and situational development succeeds whether plenty of other action movies fail, it makes the viewer feel for hero, Bruce Banner. Eric Bana has completed his personal transformation from up-and-coming actor to a genuine Hollywood star.Although the movie was a little slow at the start, when the action started, it rarely slows down. My favorite action scene was when the Hulk squared off against the military (pure action and testosterone). The CGI Hulk was amazing, complete with emotional expressiveness and realistic body movement. A true achievement in the world of Computer-Generated Imagery.Plenty of credit to Ang Lee.

And unless you have read the comic, won't have a full idea from the angle of which the movie is coming from. I was expecting a fantastic action movie before i saw it. When, at first i saw it, i was disapointed. I still don't like the flash backs. But when i went away, the more i thought about it, the more i liked it. I realised that i hadn't got a fantastic action movie, but what i had got was a lot more. It was on one level, a great action movie. The bits of action in it where superbly done, with the beutiful scences where the Hulk Was jumping across the land. Then you have a great script, with solid dialouge, that carried the story well. You also had great acting from Nick Nohlt, and good acting from the rest of the cast. It may have been slightly slow to start, but it needed that to explain Bruce Banners situation. And the film delt fantastically on how you hard it is to deal with Anger, and how not to combat it. It also delt with Bruce's dads struggle with life. How he was obsessed with his son, yet could not propaly love him, the way he felt upstaged by his son. All this was fantastic and i thought it was a triumph for Ang Lee.8/10.",Hulk

It was better than I could have ever imagined, it was perfect!!  It gives you a tragedy, and a love story, a sympathetic hero and villain.  It gives you cause and effect.  All the elements ""Jekyl and Hyde"" are here, as well as a Greek tragedy, and a tale of fathers and sons.As you have no doubt noticed I haven't given any specifics to the films plot or details as to the actions, I won't spoil anything for you.

It is more of a good story which is backed up with good action and not vice versa. A lot of people might go to see the film to see non-stop action, in which case they might be disappointed. Ang Lee is a director who is aware of plot and story development which pleases astute readers. This unfolds the story of Bruce Banner in a way that requires the audience to follow the film from beginning to end in order to understand the way a scientist, Bruce his father and Ms Ross, is able to perceive the well being of individuals and society. Even without such thinking the film is more than well structured with good action with a comic book type viewing.

""THANK YOU!"" It was everything I hoped it would be, and more.First let me qualify my review by saying I'm not much of comic book buff, but for some reason I've always been drawn to the stories of The Hulk & Spiderman. I can relate to these two guys. They've always been very real to me, unlike many of the other Comic Book Hero's we all know and love. So I was understandably torn between excitement and concern when I heard each of these Films was being made.""SPIDERMAN"" certainly didn't disappoint me at all, but I wasn't nearly as connected to him as I was to `THE HULK.' Growing up watching the TV show, I definitely had a level of expectation for Ang Lee's Film that would be very hard to meet. Well let me tell you, Ang Lee, along with his Cast & Crew, have succeeded in not only meeting my expectations, but they have surpassed them with huge, mile covering leaps & bounds.Now I'm not going to try to rebut any of the many criticisms I've heard about this Film. I'm sure those critics are at least as hard to please as I am, and probably just as stubborn. You didn't like it? That's cool. No, I don't think you missed anything. You just didn't like it. A lot of other people probably won't like either. However, I did like it. In fact, I liked it a lot. I believed it. It's as simple as that. I absolutely believed it. For the 1st time, I actually believed that Bruce Banner and The Hulk was the same person. It really came through in his eyes. I saw and felt everything Bruce/The Hulk was going through. And again, I believed it. They were actually able to make Bruce Banner look like `The Hulk' (and vice versa), instead of having to replace one Actor with another Actor who was a lot taller and worked out a lot more. Oh please don't get me wrong, I LOVED the original HULK. I never missed a single episode. Lou Ferrigno was awesome (and still is). But every time David Banner got angry on the TV Show and turned into The Hulk, I always knew that it was a different Actor. What Ang Lee was blessed with the ability to do in this Film is something they only dreamed they could do back then.What I liked most about the Film is that Bruce Banner as The Hulk doesn't just get mad & smash everything he sees. Well okay, maybe the 1st time we see him as The Hulk he's doing some mindless smashing. But after that his reactions are the direct result of the attacks being made on him. And during these moments in the Film I not only want him to, but I absolutely need him to react the way he does. And I want to stand up & cheer each time he makes it through one of those amazing battles. This is where Ang Lee's thoughtful and inspired vision really comes through. He seems to have successfully captured the deeper, human origin of The Hulk, which is the part of the story I relate to and enjoy the most.Another aspect that I was very impressed with was the growth of The Hulk as a character through the course of the Film. We get to see him develop from birth into someone who's at least somewhat aware of his own abilities. I think Ang Lee presents this aspect of the story in a masterfully subtle way.And as far as the acting goes I thought Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Sam Elliott, Nick Nolte, and Josh Lucas all did wonderful work throughout the entire Film. I'm tempted to go on about their work, but I'll hold off for fear of spoiling any parts of the Film for anyone. Suffice to say they all did a great job of keeping me thoroughly engrossed throughout the entire Film.Well that's about it. I totally enjoyed Ang Lee's version of THE HULK. I went into it with some pretty high and unrealistic expectations. But please let me say again, Ang Lee, along with his Cast & Crew, have succeeded in not only meeting my expectations, but they have surpassed them with huge, mile covering leaps & bounds.I would recommend this Film to anyone who asked. I'll be back in line Friday to see it again, and again.",Hulk
1045,thatsmaboy,The Hype is a Bit Overrated,5,18 June 2003,"I was fortunate enough to see an advanced sneak preview of the HULK, and I must admit that even though I was skeptical of seeing the flick because of the CGI and one ugly looking Hulk, I was still curious and heck it was free!
I must applaud and give an A+ to the CGI team for their exceptional detail of the HULK. The CGI was interacted into the movie a lot more seamlessly than seen in Spiderman, particularly when good 'ol Peter Parker was web slinging after his uncles murderer.While the movie was over two hours long (2:17 min), I found my rump going numb. The movie tends to drag on for a little over an hour while it is laying down the foundation for its characters. Also, if you weren't a fan of the comics but instead a fan of the series it takes a little time to adjust to the new bios.The ""Goo"" team went a little overboard with their colorful yet simple graphics which are silly enough to overlook, but the comic book frame borders for scene transitions to give us that comic book feel, while neat at first, tend to become a tad excessive. All in all, the theme of the movie was just your basic love story verses a little dysfunctional parenting, with missile toting testosterones thrown in.C+",Hulk
1046,AftrSh0k,"Good, but dissapointing...",4,20 June 2003,"I expected more.  The storyline was a bit drawn out, so the first hour of movie is really slow and boring.  The action is good and all, but Xmen 2 just outdoes it.  Wait to rent this one. It's not worth seeing in the theater.",Hulk
1047,timlauzon,A bit slow...,7,20 June 2003,"The Hulk was a bit slow getting going. A lot of character building and stuff like that to set the stage for the rest of the movie. Even once things got going the movie was filled with a lot of ""stylized"" production that I found to be out of place. The Hulk himself was rather neato though.",Hulk
1048,wootwootandwoot,Enjoyable but confusing character development,8,20 June 2003,"I give this film a 7.  It's generally entertaining and gripping in some moments.  Let's first dispense with the usuals.  The CG is nice.  Hulk's skin is a little too smooth, but the animation is nice, especially where he kicks the sh!t out of some M1s and Comanches.  Definitely sweeeet. Acting is also ok, as the actors hit all their cues.  Bana is suitably morose, Nolte is insane, and Jenny Connelly is every grad student's wet dream. There's also the right proportion of smash and mayhem to flashbacks and angst to plot development.So what's wrong with the film?  Well, it's confusing.  Not the plot (well, the ending was a little weird), but its characters.  We never quite understand who they are and what drives them. Bana's character is so ""emotionally distant"" that we never learn what his fears and hopes are, just a pastiche of flashbacks which don't add up to actual motivation.  Nolte is also confusing, mostly due to lack of exposition.  Is he just a mad scientist.  Who was he trying to better, himself, his son, mankind, or just his ego?  And how did he change in the 30 years he was locked up?  You may ask why these questions matter.  It's because by not answering them, the film ended up being episodic and disconnected.  The action seems insipid, without an underlying impulse or logic.  It's more cartoon than comic book, if you make such a distinction.That said, this film still has more ""intelligence"" (read ""bite"") comic book movie fluff and beat'em ups.  Unlike, say, Spiderman or (barf) Daredevil, it makes you want to know more about Banner and his dad, even if the film doesn't quite provide the answers.BTW, this film could've been 9 if Lee developed the characters more.  It was quite enjoyable.",Hulk

1050,eric49er,Should have ended 20 minutes earlier,7,20 June 2003,"I thought it was good. It had a pretty interesting comic book feel to it. But the ending was kinda ""blah"".  I would have preferred something open-ended like Spiderman rather than the ""let's rule the world together"" crap they came up with.If you like comics you must see it, though.  Enough good things to make it worth your two hours.",Hulk
1051,ukwildcattravis,It isn't as bad as you think,7,20 June 2003,"The acting was good. I had never heard of Eric Bana before, but I think he did a good job considering it was his first major starring role.  Nolte, Connelly, and Elliot did their job well.  (What was up with dressing Jennifer Connelly in all the baggy clothes though?!?!)The ""fate ending"" was left to be desired (but I liked the final scene though).  The Hulk looked good sometimes, sometimes not.  But I expected that.  I went to see the story, not the CGI.I'm hoping though in the next movie they have more Marvel characters (Leader and Abomination) because the toys are just boring!  It's just the Hulk and nothing else!  At least give us 6"" Banner and Connelly figures!Finally, be careful if you take your children!  Some violent scenes! This isn't Spider-Man parents!!!",Hulk
1052,dankgage,"Good, but not consistent with the TV series",8,20 June 2003,"Ya, I know it's not supposed to be consistent with the TV series... but wanted to make it clear.  I never read the comics much, but was a big fan of the TV series growning up.For fans of the TV series you can consider this as ""Hulk"" on steriods. He's bigger and stronger than ever - in my opinion, to the point of being excessive.  But I hear this is consistent with the comic - so not necessarily a bad thing.If you go into this movie as a fan of the comic or can disassociate it with the TV series - then it's an enjoyable movie.  The plot, drama and love story are all decent - in general I would say it's very ""Super Heroic"" with some decent drama thrown in.",Hulk
1053,kingsman91,Bad,3,20 June 2003,"The Hulk was not a near perfect film. In the begining, it felt like it skipped order. Another feature I did not like was the split screen. During just about all the actions sequences, there was a little picture in the corner of the screen which made it difficult to concentrate on both. There was way to much science involved with it too. The action scenes were also not realistic. The story and plot were horrible, and so was the villian. Also this move was way too long, 2 hours 10 minutes apprx. My rating 3",Hulk
1054,bojatr,Boring...,1,21 June 2003,"Disappointed to say the least.  I'm sorry but I don't have anything pleasant to say except that Jennifer Connely is beautiful.  I'd go with the TV direction anyday over the new direction.  At least the 70s television show bonded with the viewer.  The new film was lacking in everything from storyline, and realism to it's ability to catch the audience's attention. The CGI was a big green disappointment.  The movie was slow...very slow. It had an awkward editing at the beginning, where several frames were shown together.  It failed to made me feel for the Hulk.  I couldn't really care what happened to the Hulk.  Nothing connected.",Hulk
1055,arvindnair84,Boring Film,1,22 June 2003,"The action was terrible and the Hulk looked like a cartoon. The split screens were very distracting and Ang Lee didn't succeed in making it look like a cartoon, even though he tried.  The acting was generally sub-par with dead performances- Eric Bana as the Hulk was especially lethargic- excepting Nick Nolte who was okay.  To top it all off, the movie was too long at more than 2 hrs.  For summer entertainment, this is pretty poor stuff.",Hulk
1056,mburma,Very Cool!,10,21 June 2003,"Do not let any of these negative reviews deter you!  This movie is perfect! From the moment I heard they were making a movie of The Hulk, I was very skeptical.  I have been reading comics for more than three decades and The Hulk is THE largest, most over the top character in the Marvel toy chest. And Banner was always the most forgettable.  Somehow Director Ang Lee gives you both an interesting Banner and a believable Hulk.  Don't buy any of these jaded naysayers!  The big green behemoth looks great!  The backstory is well thought out and the action is in precise comic language (notice that no innocent bystanders die - just like in any Marvel comic.)  Director Lee is well-versed in comic language -not only through ""Crouching Tiger"", but remember that ""The Ice Storm"" featured Toby Maguire reading a seminal Fantastic Four comic and using them as a metaphor for his own family.This is so much better than ""Daredevil"".  It may not be a summer roller-coaster, but it's well worth your eight bucks!",Hulk
1057,herb007,Sell Your MVL Stock Monday Morning: Hulk is a Disaster,1,21 June 2003,"Saw the Hulk Friday Night and in all honesty I don't believe I have ever seen a less entertaining movie. How one director could take such a talented cast and do so little with it is beyond me. The movie is totally devoid of any humor, although I could not help laughing during Nicks last rambling pointless speech.  Spiderman, X Men, X 2, both Blades, all had at least a little humor in them. If your one of those people that have found the hidden inter-spiritual meaning of the movie, tune into CBNC Monday morning and watch what those un-enlightened normal people do to Marvel stock. I suspected Hulk was a disaster when Lee was quoted as saying ""I really like the movie. I am not sure what others will think but it meant a great deal to me, and they cannot take that away"". when you hear that type of sentimental horse---- you know your in trouble. By the way before this nightmare is over for Marvel they be giving away those Hulk Hands if you will pay for the shipping. HULK IS A DISASTER. herb007",Hulk
1058,BeSoccer14,"The Hulk, Not Incredible!",1,21 June 2003,"The hulk has to be one of the worst movies i have ever paid 9.25 to see. No only was movie's plot much to confusing, the few action scenes that the movie had, really did not make any sense. In the final fight, the Hulk battles his father in the form of a lake. For some reason there are green particles that are constantly being ripped apart. This was outdone only by the unexplained flying through the clouds by a frozen/electrified Hulk.
In the closing scene as the camera pans out through the trees away from the Hulk look for the unexplained tree frog on his hat. Like every other part of this movie there is no reason for the frog.Overall this movie was the worst I have ever watched. It is a good movie to rent for a good laugh, unfortunately it was meant to be an action/drama. A 1/10 isnt a low enough rating. Better luck next time Ang Lee",Hulk

The CGI turned out to be very impressive and the story line and acting made it a very credible movie. I actually would catagorize it as a Matrix 1 quality movie. Everything was done right but the only one problem was my butt started to hurt because it was such a long movie. It worth it to see it once in the theatre and then own it on DVD so you can watch the whole thing with the comfort of a REAL chair.

The movie by Ang Lee is another story, it was a major let down.  The beginning to the middle was entertaining at most and then the end was just like what happened.  Then ending was ambiguous especially when Bruce and his father talk for the last time in that hanger and the fight scene occurs between the both of them.

I could not have cared less for any of them throughout the entire movie. The movie was so not funny i had to laugh at non-comical humor just to maintain my sanity (the success of which is still up for argument). This movie has made me forever angry at the movie industry and we, as moviegoers, to fall into their carefully planned attack by 1) hyping a movie this awful for over a year and delivering a piece of garbage 2)us emptying our pockets to see it. May we never forget this day(s).",Hulk
1062,mshkin,Hulk movie bad!,5,25 June 2003,"This film was incredibly bad.  I've read several comments from people trying to pretend they're more intelligent than they are by saying that those who don't like it just don't care for plot.  This seems like ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" to me: ""Only smart people enjoy this film, so if you didn't enjoy it you aren't smart.""I read comics as a child and still read them on occasion.  I also watch mostly art films which are largely devoid of action.  So, my criticism of this film has nothing to do with my underappreciation of plot or my lack of interest in comic books.As for what I specifically did not like about the film, well, the story was just awful.  This was extremely hackneyed and logically incoherent.  For example, when David Banner is obviously angering Bruce, why do the military persons allow this to continue?  They are watching the whole incident on television and know what will happen if Bruce gets angry, yet do nothing.I've enjoyed other Ang Lee films (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Ice Storm)so I have to wonder what possessed him to make this.  The comic book-style editing did nothing but detract from the film.  It may have been interesting to use the split-screen occasionally during action sequences, but during the closing of a door or a low-key conversation?  It seems as though Ang Lee was really trying to make a ""motion comic book"".  However, if I wanted to read a comic book, I could, in fact, read a comic book.  The interest in watching a comic book translated into a film is just that: the translation.One good thing I will say about this film is that it was much better than ""Daredevil""",Hulk

I loved the CGI Hulk BUT not enough to justify telling anybody to waste 8 dollars to see it on the big screen.  The fact that this awfully acted and directed mess of a cinematic comic strip made it to any screen is preposterous.  After hearing the glowing reviews from some respected cinema buffs it only serves to justify what I had always expected... that the Ebert-types of the world are getting kick backs from the movie production companies to aid in the theft of your dollars.  In a nutshell... rent The Swamp Thing.. although it is a campy, comedic attempt at a super hero, it never claims to be more than that.  Hulk, disguises itself as blockbuster and fails miserably.  It is true that Ang Lee has taken cinema to points never seen before... unfortunately these points are so low that no one figured they would be witnessed on the big screen.",Hulk

EXPLOSIVE action, intense storyline, unique storytelling, and several surprises make THE HULK a MUST SEE!!!! DONT MAKE ME ANGRY...YOU WOULDNT LIKE ME WHEN IM ANGRY...so GO SEE IT!!",Hulk
1066,treytop94,Flawlessly Awful,1,30 June 2003,"If there was ever a wrong director for a movie, this is it. He takes this entire movie way too seriously. At least with Spiderman and X-Men the directors knew that when translating an unrealistic comic book to a movie with actual actors you must have some sense of humor (and they did it well). The actors in this movie are forced to deliver their lines with such seriousness in tone and expression that this in itself is almost humorous. This movie badly needs to lighten up.Right from the start we are thrust full speed into a very slow paced movie. It takes around 45 minutes of tedious, unnecessary dialogs before we even get the change to glimpse the Hulk himself. And it seems that even the scenes with the Hulk are void of any true action. I did not mind the CGI, it's more of the character that bothered me. He is by no means raging, but rather seems quite passionate in many scenes. And the action sequences are merely a repetition of a massive amounts of Army machinery hopelessly shooting everything possible at a running green Gumby.Jennifer Connelly's motive is never really explained or clear. She loves him, yet she seems to always be the reason he gets captured. The movie's dialog is made up entirely of characters either screaming or whispering, no one seems to understand the beauty of a normally spoken conversation.The special effects are completely overdone. With the exception of maybe a few frames of this movie, which they probably forgot to cut, every camera shot of people speaking is zoomed into a head shot so close that the actors might as well be sitting in a room talking into a microphone with no scenery around them. Almost every time the scene changes it fades into the next scene using a fade effect you might find built into a consumer camcorder (yes, this is utterly overdone). The few scene changes that lack this effect are graced with flashy, completely pointless computer graphics rapidly flying through the screen.The limited minutes in this movie that are not occupied by people talking through pages of pointless, dragged-out script are riddled with moving and multiplying camera angles. It usually shows the same picture at 3-5 different camera angles at once, and at some points ventures into displaying multiple scenes on the screen simultaneously. Is this an attempt to make the movie appear more comicbookish? They certainly fail to accomplish that goal. It does, however, become quite irritating and very dizzying to attempt to follow. It reminded me of those annoying pop-up windows you get on some Internet websites, only these windows kept moving.With so much talking and dialog you would think a movie over two hours in length would include some character development. On the contrary, throughout the entire movie there is not a single character that you will care about. The plot is confusing, overdone and overly complex in many respects, and much longer than it had to be (and should have been).If you have not seen this movie yet and still feel a need to put in the time, effort and money it requires, wait until it comes out on DVD. This way you could skip to the only two action sequences watch-worthy - the tanks in the dessert and the mutated dogs. To see this movie in a theater you will have to endure many slow, long, un-fulfilling dialogs that will test your ability to stay awake.",Hulk

It's a lot more dark and slower-paced, and has less humor and action. That may sound boring, but it's actually one of the most interesting films I've seen all year. I was glued to my seat for the whole two hours and twenty minutes. My friend didn't like it, however, and the audience had very strongly mixed reactions; some were actually cheering, while a few others nodded off (namely the guy behind me who started snoring loudly right before the mutant dog scene. It made a really weird accompaniment) but like I said, I was totally hooked, so proceed at your own risk.",Hulk
1068,BurntCelluloid,Sound and fury signifying nothing,5,7 July 2003,"I admire much of Ang Lee's previous work, so I was curious to see how this project would pan out.  I decided to see it despite some of the scathing reviews because God knows there have been many great films that were misunderstood at first.  Unfortunately, this film succeeds more as a bizarre curiosity than as a popular film or as a work of art.  I'll try to cover the salient points:STORY & CHARACTER: Like something I blew out of my nose.  The characters are all one-dimensional Freudian stereotypes, and that's during their better moments.  So many baffling questions remain: what the heck was David Banner fighting with his wife about when he `accidentally' killed her?  More to point, why would a lovely woman like her even marry a psycho bully with a cheesy moustache like him in the first place?  Why is General Ross such a turgid pr-ck?  Did his daddy beat him too?  How on earth did a monster like him sire such a calm, composed (if weepy), loving, intelligent, down-to-earth woman like Betsy?  Who were the people who raised young Bruce? His adoptive mother (whom we see exactly once) seems like a good woman: why is he so emotionally cold and repressed when he was raised in such a loving family?  Are the filmmakers trying to imply that genes are everything?  I realize that these are silly questions to be asking about the characters in a summer blockbuster, but hey, the filmmakers are the ones who insisted on bringing family psychodrama into the picture, not I.  Making a psychological drama with one-dimensional characters is about as interesting as making a porn film with mannequins.CINEMATOGRAPHY & EDITING: There was some interesting experimentation going on here but it was inert: it did nothing to contribute to the story or add up to a coherent aesthetic experience.  Sometimes there were multiple panels and sometimes there weren't, but it all seemed rather haphazard.  The jelly fish and cellular patterns and lichens and so on were pretty, but overused.The editing was inept and self-indulgent, with huge stretches of dead time. Lots of totally unnecessary transition scenes, people just sitting around, stuff that even Tarkovsky might have left on the cutting room floor.DIALOGUE:  It absolutely defies belief that James Schamus, the man who gave us the zippy repartee of The Ice Storm, had anything to do with this script at all.  I'd like to blame the other two screenwriters for this botch, but I don't see why he didn't just rewrite their migraine-inducing contributions if that were the case.  I think there was maybe one (intentionally) funny line in the whole movie.ACTING: Eric Bana: Tried to look repressed, wound up looking constipated.  Maybe that's what caused his transformations: `HULK STUCK!'  Too bad they didn't do a product tie-in with Metamucil. Jennifer Connelly: She's starting to get good at her one and only character. Nick Nolte: Not as bad as he was made out to be.  He went over the top, sure, but there was something almost King Lear-like about his performance. Sam Elliot: Silly stuff, but he did what he could with a bad script.There were a few interesting ideas in this film, the best of them probably being the conception that fathers want to suck the lifeblood out of their sons.  This kind of pushes it too far of course but I'd guess even the most devoted fathers sometimes envy their sons' youth, vitality, energy, sex appeal, what have you.  So this turns into a nice inversion of the Oedipal complex, played out when father and son confront each other and Bruce says, `I should have killed you,' to which David Banner says, `No, I should have killed you.'  A lot of people laughed at that line, but I think it sums up the most interesting conceit in the whole film.  There was also a kind of Faustian subtext to the whole thing, but the Faust legend has been done endless times before and much better than here.  The only truly believable Faustian bargain here was the one that Lee/Schamus made when they accepted this project.Despite everything, though, the film does grow on you in a `boy I wouldn't want to sit through that whole thing again but maybe I'll rent the DVD to fast-forward to the interesting bits' kind of way.  For example, I'm still haunted by that look of melancholy ecstasy on the Hulk's face as he's flying through the sky.  Was it worth sitting through hours of dreadful dialogue, creaky plot mechanics, and static editing?  Probably not.  It's not worth a bar of Schubert, that's for sure.  But who knows, maybe this mad, mad movie will keep growing on me to the point that I almost, just barely like it.All in all, this movie was a noble failure.  Ang Lee and his team tried to breathe new life into a tired genre and create an ambitious film that would appeal both to mindless teenage boys and to thoughtful grown-ups who read Freud and Faust.  Well, `I've got a news flash for you' (to borrow one of the clichés that litter the script): it can't be done.  It puts the work at catastrophic cross-purposes with itself.  There's something frankly hysteric and schizoid about this film: stretched in all directions, it is animated primarily by an infantile acting out, an undisciplined excrescence of repressed material on the part of the filmmakers.  This is sort of fitting when you consider the subject matter, but it seems to me in the end to be a fatal confusion of means and ends, content and technique.Please Ang Lee, please, no Hulk II.  I and others admire your desire to stretch yourself; nobody expects you to go back to the lovely low-budget days of Wedding Banquet or the lively cynicism of The Ice Storm.  But there's just got to be a better way.",Hulk

1071,Elvis-SUN-,...a pleasant surprise,9,11 July 2003,"I went to see Hulk having very low expectations, mostly after reading dozens of average reviews.But I must say I was pleasantly surprised.I never read the comic book or saw any of the TV-show, so on that account I didnt have anything to be disappointed about.The movie is a bit long, but the editing made scenes interesting, which might have been a tad boring without it. The way the editing, the picture-in-picture and the switching camera angles (breaking the basic rules of film over and over) made the movie more comic-book'ish is very successful. It's a good way of showing this movie doesn't necessaily stay within the boundaries you'd expect.The acting was overall very good, with Eric Bana having the hardest job.. It doesn't matter how good you are, you cannot avoid looking pathetic when you 10 seconds earlier stood 15ft tall and wrecked half of town, and now you're whining and almost can't stay on your feet, only covered by your super stretch boxers.The action scenes were very energetic - none of them being too much (like in Matrix 2). Hulk was very brutal indeed, in a way i could've only hoped!I don't know if the story is close to that of the comics, but it was very entertaining in my opinion, with a nice quiet build-up giving space for decent character introductions. Action and drama goes well hand in hand, and in this movie, one cannot live without the other.While it's obvious Hulk is computer generated, the CGI crew did a great job blending him into the surroundings, and watching him jumping around, throwing with tanks and thelike is very enjoyable.I was afraid I was gonna be disappointed, but against my expectations I felt greatly entertained by Hulk, and I can only hope for a sequel.",Hulk

1073,grinchmatz16,...waist of my time...,2,7 July 2003,"The Hulk had to be the most anticipated and most advertised movie I have ever laid my eyes on. You couldn't go anywhere and not see it. [i.e. local grocery, internet] I myself was not that anxious to see it, but after awhile I said what the hell. Oh man was that a mistake. This movie was a waist of my time! First off there is a lot of talking [a lot!]. Kind of like the first half hour of SPIDER-MAN, but this is half of the HULK. It was boring. I was wondering if there was even a monster in it at all. Even when the good scenes start it is hard to make out what he's doing. It is dark and the camera is so whack. Why can't the unique split-screen effects [you see plenty in the movie] come into play when the Hulk is in action. The scenes near the end are the only good ones, but they're so silly. In the animated series it actually looks like the Hulk is leaping at a great distance. Here he bounces like a little ball a couple of times and then floats for a long time. The only thing good about this film is [no not the story, it was lame too] the characters. The actors portray them very well and I was pretty shocked on how they pulled it off. Never the less this movie would of been a lot better if it had more 'Hulk', less laughable action scenes, and an occasionable laugh ever now and then to balance out the boredom. This is probably the worst comic book movie released. For 'real' Hulk action go back to the comic books.RATING: 2/10",Hulk
1074,hologramx,Unique,8,9 July 2003,"Having just watched 'Hulk' I'd have to say it is completely unique to the current crop of 'Comic Book Action Hero Movies'. Unique in the fact that it is actually a decent movie.Ang Lee manages to present an involving Origin story without getting too bogged down in the details and leaving you constantly wanting for the few extra clues to Hulk's back story, while still paying attention to what is happening in the present. Amazing action, great story and brilliant acting, a first rate example at how to recreate comic book's on the big screen.Basically it comes down to this, did you enjoy X-Men 1 or 2? If so don't watch this movie as it's on a completely different level that you just won't understand.",Hulk
1075,BigDaddyT,Top Five worst movies,1,10 July 2003,"I went to see the Hulk for two reasons, the first being that I have seen all the other movies out at the moment and second I was bored. I have to say that I am an avid fan of movies and love all kinds. You name the genre I have seen a vast range of movies that will fall into the category, in short I have seen a obscene amount of films. I have to say that his movie is in the top five of all time in my opinion. I hate the fact that I went to see it and contributed to its box office success.Why did I hate this movie so much well to be completely honest there was not one thing redeeming about it. The story has been done over and over again. The effects would have been better if the film company used a cartoon where the green creature appears instead of the so-called state of the art special effects. The characters were so obnoxious except for Josh Lucas who looks good in suit and plays a good power hungry vilan and Connely whos wasted on such a stupid movie.The effects were so fake a sixth grader in paintshop could have created a more believable looking hero. Sorry to insult six graders, I meant to say first grader. I thought the effects in the Martix and in Terminator 2 made over 10 years ago were so much better and if at times looked a little fake you could see it wasnt for a lack of effort. The Hulk looked more like Shrek than the comic book character that we know and love. No offence to Shrek.Nevermind the acting, if we concentrate on the actors themselves. Nick Nolte a word of advice get out of the acting game. Bana don't even think about starting. Nick Nolte is so bad and annoying that I have lost all respect for him as an actor. Bana is the biggest geek I have ever seen in a movie, even worse than Jason Biggs in ""Loser"" and Brendan Fraiser in ""Bedazelled"". I could not stand him. I thought because he is a scientist that he might have that ""feeling sorry for"" oura about him but  he comes off as unsimpathtic and does not even change into a cool bad-a** by the end but remains a unsimpathetic geek.The story can be summed up like this. The animation of the Hulk is a fake and far fetched as the story. In short its crap. Written on the back of a pizza box. Also Hulk is not the only animation in the movie but his dad played Nolte also transforms into this inexplicable ""thing"" influenced by electricity or something, oh and that is also blatantly fake.Conclusion, do not go see this movie unless you wish to avoid someone, because I guarantee you I they follow into the movie they will leave after 47 seconds due to boredom. It was a total waste of time and the only reason why I didnt walk out was due to the fact that I have never walk out before the end of the film.",Hulk
1076,Janus822,"A Truly Great Movie, not just another comic movie.",8,23 June 2004,"This film was set up to be a winner. With a cast ranging from at the timeunknown Eric Bana to the great Nick Nolte this film had promise written all over it. To make the pot overflow with talent add the likes of Jennifer Connelly, Sam Elliot, and the beautifully unique direction of Ang Lee. From the beginning of the film you knew you were not in for your typical attempt at a big budget comic film but a comic film that aspired to truly flesh out the characters and bring them to life, something this film has successfully done. Although the plot doesn't stay one hundred percent true to Bruce Banner'scomic origins, the film does stay true to the spirit and overall comic basis. Even more shocking is the fact that the story lines are so universal that we can all relate to them, pulling the audience deeper into Ang Lee's vision and Stan Lee's creation.",Hulk
1077,achtungguy,"Hulk isn't Spiderman, and that's a good thing.",10,12 July 2003,"Hulk isn't Spiderman, and that's a good thing.  Not to say I didn't like Spiderman (I loved it) but the Hulk needed to be presented in a different way.  This is a story about a man and his inner (and now outer) demons and it has been told in a way that only Ang Lee could tell.  This isn't a cartoon romp through New York nor should it be.  Sorry if you were upset that Lee was trying to tell a story and not destroy all of San Francisco (though the Hulk did do a number on the city), but that's what Lee does. This was, in my opinion, the best comic book adaption to date by one of the great directors of our time.  Go watch it again for what it is supposed to be, not for the Spiderman clone you wanted.",Hulk
1078,MrDarko,Far better than the mainstream will admit!,8,27 July 2003,"The Hulk is an excellent attempt at trying to bring to life one of the most famous comic book characters of all time. What many people seem to have missed, is that this is not attempting to be a super hero film in traditional sense. There is not the generic and simplistic ""good guy vs Bad Guy story"" which are ever present in both the Spider-man and Superman franchises. This film is far more complex than that, in the sense that Banner himself has conflicting views on his own abilities, and that he does present a real danger to himself and others. The threat of this danger provide a tension throughout this film. The acting is very good by all the major cast. Eric Bana really gets across the inner underlying aggression of the character, and there is good chemistry between him and Connelly. Ang Lee should be commended for trying to add a greater complexity to this genre. The use of split screen panels provides the film with a fast moving pace, and also allows alot of information to be displayed and understood at anyone time. I also feel this film contains the most complex and ambitious CGI I have ever seen, though it is not the most effective. I feel the movement and the muscle tone of the hulk are spot on. Though the face could have been improved so that there is more life in the characters eyes. However I can ignore this due to the  breathtaking action scenes between the Hulk and the army which are far better than I expected. This is NOT a bad film as many people seem to insist. In fact in my view Lee has managed to create a film which is a very worthwhile addition to the genre. There was always going to be a backlash against comic book films due to there recent resurgence, and the Hulk has received the majority of this due to a less than impressive super bowl trailer. The simple fact is that most people had made there opinion on this film before they had even seen it. The Hulk is one of the most interesting and entertaining blockbusters of the summer and deserve far more recognition than it has received!",Hulk
1079,sadprofessor1,a spectacular cinematic achievement.,10,21 July 2003,"bizarrely underrated. an incredibly accomplished and beautiful piece of film making. faithful in all aspects to the essence and mythology of the comic book character, but also imbued with depth, subtlety, and lyricism. the directors individual style and flair is stamped all over the movie and imparts it with a gravitas that has not yet been seen in any summer popcorn flick. the photography and use of imagery is mesmerising, and the remarkable use of editing adds to the beauty. lee has shown that he is master of action directing. several of the key sequences are fantastically entertaining. the quality of the special effects and the CGI work on the hulk character himself is seamless and is probably the best work that ILM has produced to this date. astonishing. a surprisingly underrated gem that has obviously been a labour of love for all those involved in its making. hats off to lee, the producers, the screenwriters, and ILM. in my mind, certainly the best superhero film made to date, which is no mean feat considering the two xmen movies, and towers above spiderman and daredevil in terms of quality. makes one truly long for a sequel, and lets hope its not too far away.",Hulk

1084,JaceFury,Excellent Transition from print to screen,8,26 July 2003,"In truth, the Incredible hulk is a barely veiled retelling of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde"" but it has always been a favorite of mine. As a person who loves and collects comics, I was worried that this movie, like so many others, would ignore the subject matter. I was right.The plot of the hulk and the circumstances of his origin do not follow the stories from the comics and I really don't know why, but strangely... i found myself not caring too much. Quite simply.. the movie rocked.I must tell you that you have to be patient. Almost an hour of the movie goes by before any action starts. and i was seriously saying ""GET TO IT ALREADY"". Once we first get a glimpse of the Hulk, however, its all over. In my opinion, this is the single greatest realization of a comic book character to the screen. I edged to the tip of my seat and gripped the armrests watching the violent emerald behemoth. It actually made me want to break something or roar out-loud! The screen often breaks into comic book panels with action going on in different windows, which i found really cool and interesting. and the acting is quite good. You can feel the primal rage of banner as he squirms in anger... it looks like he is going to explode trying to repress his emotions.There are a couple of small problems. A) The first half of the movie is really slow. not bad, just slow. Kids will find it unbearable. B) Resolution of the main villain's plot is a little goofy.Other than these things, this movie is a definite ""Must see"". Marvel Comics is making a respectable Offensive in bringing their characters to the screen and the Hulk is definitely one of their better attempts.Go see it now -Jace",Hulk

It could have been a great movie, at least as great as Spiderman, but instead it sucks big time. It is supposed to be a sci-fi/action movie, but I would classify it as a drama/psychopathology movie, which means that the characters are all very mentally disturbed, and that the movie is only good for psychology students or professionals.Evaluation: 1 in 1000 (seriously!).",Hulk

1090,Yitzak,Surprisingly Different Super Hero movie,8,15 November 2003,"WARNING: CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERSLet's start with some of the other Superhero movies as of late.  I loved both Spiderman and X-Men, they were VERY well done and accurately portrayed the characters, although Daredevil was AWFUL (won't Ben Affleck just GO AWAY!)I was a little skeptical about the Hulk, although a) I was intrigued by the fact that Ang Lee directed it, and b) I am an absolutely sucker for anything starring Jennifer Connelly, so I decided to give it a try.  Plus, when I was little I used to love the Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno Hulk TV show :)The opening sequence of the movie starts with some kinda pseudo-genetic mutation stuff and is admittedly a bit hard to follow, so if you see the movie, pay attention to the opening sequence.  The film then takes about 40 minutes to build up story with Banner, his girlfriend, his girlfriend's army general father (good to see Sam Elliot still in movies) before we finally see the Hulk.  It is worth the wait, the CGI is VERY convincing, not to mention that the Hulk is friggen huge!  As much as a I appreciate the old Hulk TV series, I always imagined Hulk being about the size he is in this movie.  Anyway, the rest of the movie proceeds at a decent pace.  The last half hour is a really sweet chase scene which features the Hulk battling army vehicles and just causing general mayhem in the desert on his way to San Francisco (I think it was SF)Some complaints: after being very impressed with Willem Dafoe's performance as Green Goblin in Spiderman, I was expecting a lot out of Nick Nolte.  He didn't really deliver.  Also, the ending is kinda weird.
Highlights: 1) the way the Hulk looked 2) the action scenes, especially the fight scene with the three mutated dogs 3) the fact that the Hulk looked like a giant teddy bear when he wasn't fighting 4) This part was really different: the screen was separated into different panes in which the action was taking place during the really tense scene.  It was like a comic book with each pane having a separate action scene!  It sounds distracting, but it worked REALLY well.Closing thought: A lot of people think this movie is too slow.  I disagree. Most of us North Americans are impatient, and as such complain when a movie isn't BANG BANG over before it starts.  Although the dialogue may not have been oscar material, it was like ""Let's take some time to develop the story before we put the Hulk in.  Then, we'll keep developing the story"" as opposed to ""Gee, let's have Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner fight for no apparent reason, then we'll distract the audience from the fact that this movie is going to suck by throwing in the latest Evanescence song!""My rating: 8/10PS Sorry this is so long, this is my first ever user comment.",Hulk
1091,soothsayerinc,"Slow Start, Somewhat Entertaining. Too Long",4,21 November 2003,"I watched the Hulk was probably lower expectations than normal as several people had already said it was a ""middle of the road"" movie. We saw it on DVD and it has a very slow start. It does however pick up a bit in the middle where we eventually see the green guy do his thing. This was entertaining/funny but not at all very realistic. But why would you be watching a super hero movie if you're looking for realistic.
The movie takes a bit of a downward turn in the end - I never did fully understand what was going on.Overall probably less than excellent. If you want to see a good super hero movie checkout the X-Men or even spiderman. They're better. Possibly even Daredevil too - although thats open for question. If the Hulk was stripped down to about 60 or 90 minutes it would be a much better show.",Hulk
1092,calebacole,Why didn't anyone stop this guy??,3,4 November 2011,"I know this is a really late rating, but better late than never.Honestly all I can say is I only watched maybe 30-40 minutes tops for this movie, for a few reasons.1. Within the allotted time I was watching, I was waiting for Bruce Banner to turn into the Hulk. And needless to say, I was disappointed. When he finally did turn into the Hulk, it looked like a cheap plastic toy was used as a model for the designers/creators of Hulk's appearance.2. The story was going almost nowhere. It seemed like the plot was introducing background for the longest time. Some movies don't have enough background on the characters, but this one had to much. Main Character Backrounds should be only about 15 minutes in the beginning or gradually telling it a little at a time as the story is progressing.3. I was just plain BORED!

1094,GreatMuppetyOdin,"More poetic, but also rougher around the edges",6,30 April 2012,"This movie is in some ways ugly, in some ways beautiful. Well, maybe not quite beautiful, but there's some art and depth to it, it's just not very polished. Could have used a rewrite, some better visual effects, and a better DP. Also a better cast would have helped. Some of the acting is good, but - without naming names - there are a few poor casting choices in there. In some ways, it feels like a TV movie. A bit rushed, a bit shoddy-looking, and ""not quite there"", but it has some heart to it. There are some clever ideas, some emotional depth and poetry to this movie, but I can't help but feel like it could have come together a bit better. In comparison to the 2008 Marvel Studios version, it wins in some respects and loses in others. The 2008 film looked better, and had a more fun-to-watch Banner, but its Hulk was just anticlimactic instead of cathartic. This one has some of the same issues, but is slightly more balanced in making Banner and the Hulk feel a bit more like parts of the same character. Not to anywhere near the glorious extent to which it was accomplished in 2012's ""The Avengers"", but closer than 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk"" in my opinion. I also felt like we got to spend more time with Edward Norton's Banner than Eric Bana's, but on the other hand, Ang Lee manages to tell us a lot about Bruce Banner's psychology without using too much overtly expository dialogue to do it. In some cases, it works, and in others it doesn't. Some things are conveyed beautifully through subtext and symbolism, while others are straight up shown in overt and clunky flashback. ""Show don't tell"" is occasionally taken a little too literally in this film, jumping back and forth between subtle and on- the-nose. One thing that bothered me was the editing. I get the idea; Ang Lee is excited to be making a comic book movie, so he wants to make nods to the fact that it's a comic book movie by using comic panel-like transitions, which ultimately just ends up looking tacky and unprofessional. It's a cute idea, but it doesn't really work, as it takes the viewer out of the story and goes ""HEY LOOK IT'S A COMIC BOOK MOVIE I'M MAKING A COMIC BOOK MOVIE COOL HUH YEAH I THOUGHT SO"". It reminds me of that episode of The Simpsons where Homer starts editing home videos and puts star wipes everywhere. We get it, Ang Lee, you're making a comic book movie, you don't have to rub our noses in it. Unfortunately, this along with the lighting, photography and goofy-looking Hulk design adds to the aforementioned made-for-TV look of the piece. The dialogue also ranges between bland and poetic, but luckily never idiotic (although perhaps somewhat melodramatic in places). Danny Elfman's music is as usual inventive, strange and heavily percussive, and really adds to the pile of good things about this movie. Also a lot of Eastern influences are present, in somewhat more obvious ways than most of his other comic book movie soundtracks. Thematically, where 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk"" is mostly about self- control, this movie is about anger. Not about controlling anger, not about embracing it, but about anger itself. It's an exploration of a state of mind. In some ways, it works. In other ways, it's a mess. This movie is not stupid. Nor is it necessarily bad. It's very uneven, and a bit ugly, but it has some artistic value, as it's a fairly interesting exploration of the Hulk concept and the Bruce Banner character. It's a very different comic book movie, and definitely worth checking out; just don't expect perfection or a typical action comic book flick. This is a confused movie, unsure of whether it wants to be an action movie or an art house film, and perhaps that represents the duality of Dr. Banner himself. Too bad the action aspects simply didn't work. Given a bit more time and creative support, this movie could probably have been something very special. As it is, it's an experiment that didn't quite work out as planned, but had some somewhat interesting results. Much like the Hulk himself.",Hulk
1095,AditoSoze,Thoughtful and entertaining,8,6 November 2012,"Neatly written, poetically picturised and filled with terrific performances, 'Hulk' is one of the rare comic book characters that has been transformed beautifully into a mainstream film. Also add the mesmerizing background score. I loved the way the film portrayed the character of Bruce(Bana gives a brilliant underplayed performance) as a intellectual whose mind is filled with some serious trauma which he cannot remember initially. I felt empathy for Bruce whenever he has dreadful dreams about his past. Also the film tried to behave as a study of Bruce Banner's psyche rather than offering Hulk's stunts alone(which too were a great fun to watch). Bana and Connelly shared great screen chemistry which was emotional, realistic and far better than that of Spiderman's lead pair. The scene where Betty sees Bruce as Hulk for the first time and they stare at each other with mixed emotions was beautiful.It is sad to know that this film didn't do well commercially as a superhero film normally does. May be the reason was it tried to visualize Hulk as a sad character filled with fear and due to the fact that the film was dark and depressing and without any humour.I would compare this film with Christopher Nolan's work in Batman trilogy. All three films had dark styles and serious plots with very less humour(and were very good of course)but the second and third films were a great success commercially owing to the powerful villains in Joker and Bane. May be that is what this film lacked. Bruce's father was portrayed brilliantly but i couldn't understand clearly whether he loved his son or not. That said this film was entertaining and satisfying for me and i feel that it is seriously underrated. I recommend this film for anyone who actually like to watch the issues that are troubling the mind of Bruce along with the thrills and macho stunts which only the Hulk can provide.",Hulk
1096,blackogre1313,Misunderstood,9,25 January 2005,"Many of the people that I know didn't think too highly of the Hulk film (some actually considered it fairly wretched). I believe that this is partially due to the expectations people had for the film.I think many expected the jade Goliath to show up almost immediately and start swinging until the credits rolled, and perhaps utter ""Hulk Smash!"" intermittently.For me the Hulk has always been more than a simple adolescent power trip/violence fantasy. As clichéd as it sounds I've always seen it as a study of the nature of man, spotlighting the less refined and more naturalistic side of the beast as well as speaking sagely of the ills of emotional repression.When I explained that the Hulk is best viewed as a psychological study and not a ""superhero"" my girlfriend found the film much more entertaining.Ang Lee's direction was excellent as was Eric Bana's performance as the emotionally numbed Bruce Banner.Admittededly some aspects were a bit asinine ""Remember my bad knee, now it's my good knee.""

The plot is completely disjointed and almost impossible to follow. The characters have virtually no development or consistency. The CGI is awful. The sound levels go from zero to warp and back again for seemingly no story related reason.

They are clearly written by people who were expecting HULK to be a no-brainer,one dimensional action film.You should not go into this movie thinking its going to be another comic book superhereo movie. This movie was made by the makers of Crouching, Tiger Hidden Dragon,James Schamus and Ang Lee.They don't make one dimensional movie, but movies with many layers. The HULK is more a FRANKENSTEIN movie, where David Banner(Nick Nolte) creates a monster.

David Banner is shown running a PCR analysis in 1965, too bad Cary Mullis, who won the Nobel Prize for the technology, was not only a child, but was about thirty years away from publishing his finding!? Is it because I typically like Ang Lee movies so I had high expectations? Is it because I suffered through this mess because I kept thinking ""This movie stinks, but Eric Bana's hot."" I guess that's the punishment for being shallow. The bottom line is the motivations of the characters are preposterous or unclear, the supposed troubled love affair between Betty and Bruce is never fully explored and there are huge plot holes. There's no real pay-off in the end, and you basically are left thinking ""what the hell just happened?"" I don't blame the actors-I typically enjoy Bana, Connelly and Elliot, they were stuck with stilted dialogue and erratic direction. I blame the producers for giving the job to Lee whose talents lie in smaller, more intimate stories. Bottom line: stay away, far, far away.",Hulk
1101,Warble2850,People really hate this movie. I really hate people.,10,27 July 2004,"The Hulk, in the core story, never really was a superhero. The targeted audience, or more, the audience which targeted themselves for this movie, came in for a superhero movie. Is the Hulk really that unloved by the American non-comic reading public that they don't, at the very least, understand that the Hulk has always been a psychological thriller, about one mans inability to deal with emotional strain?If we were to have received the movie they had been expecting, where we see endless sequences of Hulk smash, we would be left wondering where all the rage was coming from. The Bruce Banner trauma storyline is used to explain why the Hulk can't be controlled, and anybody who watches this movie and fails to grasp that should feel right at home at this summers Catwoman.The story of the Hulk offers so much to people like myself who aren't exactly emotionally stable. Spider-Man can appeal to everyone, the Hulk is a more personal sort of character to identify with, and even through a few dryly delivered lines, still manages to reach inside of us and make us feel like we know exactly the sort of torment Bruce Banner is going through.In the end, the Hulk turns out to be a movie for either those most familiar with the comic, or those who would absolutely never read comics. The action sequences and the Hulks rage are all an extension of the drama, not the other way around. And while that may turn off thousands of people who were hoping for an action packed slug fest with no meaning, it distinguishes Hulk from other comic book movies, and will ultimately secure this movie a very loyal following.It's a damn shame nobody involved wants a sequel, there's so much dramatic potential in Banner attempting to rid himself of the Hulk, and now that all the people who don't need to be watching a Hulk movie won't want to, the sequel would probably wind up a lot more loved by those who do go out to see it.",Hulk

I cannot believe the garbage that Hollywood is coming out with. They didn't even try to come up with a good plot. They just tried to ride the Comic Book wave of crap that they are putting out. There was about 10 minutes of good action in the middle when the Hulk was throwing some tanks around. But sitting through what seemed like 5 hours of dribble is not worth it. If like the comic books, i would recommend Spiderman I and II. Do not watch this movie or Daredevil. They both stink.

It seems as though the writers were told about a giant green man named Hulk and they proceeded to write a thin script. With the amount of past story lines that were rich with characterization and pathos you'd think it'd be pretty hard to screw this one up. What was marvel entertainment thinking this time around? I understand that they can't placate the purists all the time but man, at least put some effort into it. I haven't hated a movie this bad since...ever. ""Hulk"" goes down in my book as the worst film ever made. James Cameron's got nothing on the disgusting pigs who made this steaming pile of dog turd.",Hulk
1107,robdixon,"A rewritten, convoluted mess",3,24 October 2004,"I had read some bad reviews of the Hulk film before I watched it. Ang Lee is one of my favorite directors (I loved the English Patient and Crouching Tiger) so I assumed he had added some intelligence and lyricism to the Hulk, and perhaps that was turning off some of the comic book film reviewers. In any case, I really wanted to see this film, just to see what Ang Lee would do with the material.If you feel the same way, I entreat you: don't bother watching The Hulk! For every interesting scene or technique Ang Lee presents, there are a dozen frustrations. This movie wasn't just bad, it was sometimes infuriating.The ""story"" was by James Schamus, a long-time Ang Lee collaborator and, I'm guessing, not much of a comic book fan. The premise of the original Hulk was simple and powerful: a wimpy scientist with qualms about making weapons gets caught in the blast radius of a Gamma bomb and turns into the Hulk whenever anger overcomes him. In this film Schamus alienates every Hulk fan with a cliché and convoluted new backstory involving a lunatic father, microbiological ""nanomeds"", a family tragedy, reptile experiments, and a poorly contrived Gamma radiation lab accident. To make matters worse Banner's Hulk transformation is now caused by ""repressed memories,"" not anger! Ridiculous scenes follow. At first Banner transforms because of a phone message he hears (that triggers a memory). Later Banner gets beaten and tasered by a bad guy, and he won't transform! They have to resort to a crazy underwater psychological experiment to trigger a repressed memory so he can transform.Stan Lee and the Marvel comics guys crafted some great, classic stories. The Spiderman films show that being essentially true to these stories can lead to great films. Ang Lee and James Schamus must not have understood the original story, or thought they could do better, and they created an incoherent mess instead.That said, Ang Lee's talents were not completely misused. The film is not 100% bad. What worked: The split-screen montages are the best approximation of comic book panel pacing that I've seen. The CGI model of the Hulk is awesome, with great musculature. The bounding-through-the-desert scenes are liberating, especially after the plodding pace of the rest of the film. Occasional flashes of good acting come from Sam Elliott and Jennifer Connelly.What didn't work: The lame new Hulk origin story. About 100 obvious holes in the story continuity (such as: Hulk destroys the research lab, but then a day later the evil Dad gets into the now clean, non-destroyed lab and uses it for his own purposes). The Hulk's skin texture maps: all the layering and work that went into making them realistic was wasted because of the neon green coloring. The extreme darkness of many of the action scenes makes it impossible to know what's going on. The list of bad stuff could be longer, but I'll stop there.If you watch this on DVD you can get some clues about why this film went so wrong. In Ang Lee's commentary he says that his wife has been a molecular biologist for years, and biology labs ""are what I know""-- so you can see how the forced biology and ""nanomeds"" elements in the story came about. Lee also describes, almost proudly, how he came up with some of the ""pseudo-science"" that made the story so nonsensical. I guess he doesn't realize that comic and sci-fi movie fans want their pseudo-science plausible and coherent. He talks about how costly it was to build a log cabin all the way up in Sequoia National Park--for a 10-second scene where the setting was not even important. Did the film's investors know how much money was being squandered this way? Has Lee's artistic ego gotten the best of his judgment?You also learn that James Schamus is credited as Producer/Story/Screenwriter, and that there were two other screenwriters added later, one of whom is a comic book fan. When a Producer writes the script, you can bet that story editing is going to be thin (who wants to cross the producer?). The comic book fan was probably brought in to fix some of the most egregious holes in the story, but it was too little too late.I'm afraid I can't recommend this film to anyone except film students who want to learn how NOT to make a comic book inspired movie.",Hulk

1111,pieries_is,Most Psychological SuperHero movie,9,12 March 2006,"i'm sure most comic book fans will disagree with me, but when a comic is adapted to a movie changes must be made, and only what will work as a FILM must be kept. Ang Lee did this very well. his mistake was that he aimed this movie at adults and not the younger audience. But as far as character depth is concerned, it doesn't get much deeper than this!Yes the parts that people had problems with the comic-film transition; the fathers' connection with injecting a serum into him bruce as a child. This only heightened his anger towards the father. The other reason for adding this change was due to the fact that the popularity of RADIATION-MUTANTS is not there anymore. Ang Lee did his research right; in the 40s-50s most movies, comics, cartoons had the themes of radiated creatures ranging from ants to earthworms(yes there was an old B&W movie that i saw). That is such a primitive idea, the audience of today is far more intelligent of general knowledge that it would not have been accepted. This is why he added a more complex twist.Others have been angered that his father becomes ABSORBING MAN. This too was done for a story reason. it would have been difficult to bring a character out of the blue and connect it to the way the story was moving. I do agree that there should have been more action, and the Dogs were Definitely a bad idea, should have scrapped that Lee. The camera-work with the panels, very appropriate.it was brilliant, and i can't wait for the sequel.",Hulk

Not only was it not like what we remember from the TV series, it took on a totally different genre. Let's call it sci-stupid.Maybe the director took a nap while this was filming. It's the only way I can see how this even got through the editing department. Lots of holes and confusing turns in the script that you get really lost in the story and are not sure what is going on with Betty & Bruce. Also the same thing with his relationship with his father and we never really understand what happened to his mother and for what reason. I was also confused with Betty's father.....sometimes he's a mean dude and then you think he's OK but then he's a jerk again.It was too long of a movie and it took way too much time trying to paint the base coat.

1113,miltonfludgecow,"Crouching Hulk, Hidden Nolte",1,20 May 2015,"Now that Marvel films are some of the greatest money-makers on the planet, it feels good to reflect upon a time when they spewed out movies that weren't up to par. Remember the Fantastic 4 films? How about ""Daredevil"" and ""Elektra""? And don't even get me started on the Ghost Rider films. Thankfully, with the introduction of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, bad comic book movies are kept to a minimum. But I personally think the film that started Marvel's downward spiral was ""Hulk"".Notorious art-house director Ang Lee is the film's field general and you could definitely smell his pretentious stench upon the first couple minutes of film. Most critics argue that his style brings out the philosophy of the character and helps explore deep psychological aspects that most comic book filmmakers haven't touched upon. In reality, his brand of cinema doesn't mesh at all with the comic book movie formula at the time of the film's release. Audiences were used to seeing over-the-top, wisecracking superheroes grace the screen. Ang Lee wanted to try something different, but I'm afraid he bit off more than he could chew. It wasn't until a few years later when Christopher Nolan directed The Dark Knight trilogy, which showed audiences worldwide how to successfully create a comic book movie with dark and philosophical themes.First off, the look of the film is exasperating. Lee throws in a menagerie of weird Malick-like visuals to create symbolism, but it only confuses the audience. The comic book motif was cute at first but got annoying real quick. Audiences are quite aware that they are watching a movie based on a comic book. Seeing four poorly-executed shots at once should be classified as ""sensory overload"". And while the overall cinematography wasn't all that bad, there are instances where the shots and editing are just plain awful (shots being flipped for no reason, shots fading to black for no reason, ugly scene transitions, etc). The effects are laughable, to say the least. Back in the day, the Hulk looked like the real deal. Twelve years pass and now he looks like a bad PlayStation character. The Hulk Dogs were even worse. They looked like computer-generated Scooby-Doo dogs from Hell. The editors and special effects crew definitely wanted to try some new tricks out, but some of the scenes look like they were made with filters in Microsoft Movie Maker. To think this film was released ten years after ""Jurassic Park""- one of the most groundbreaking films regarding special effects. Alas, the tacky effects are only one part of this hulk-sized atrocity.The acting is more wooden than a Louisville Slugger- and Eric Bana is the ringleader. We know Bana tries his darnedest to give us a performance for the ages, but he always falls flat. In ""Hulk"", he's either softly speaking in a dull, monotone American accent or yelling gibberish. The audience is supposed to empathize with his character, but after countless confusing scenes, we simply can't. I had tremendous high hopes for Jennifer Connelly- who was amazing in Ron Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind"", which was released two years prior. Sadly, she falls under Ang Lee's spell and becomes just as wooden as Bana. Most scenes with her character are drab and lack emotion. She is constantly starry-eyed and weeps over everything. Sam Elliot is Sam Elliot, plain and simple. Josh Lucas' character was surprisingly forgettable. But what really threw me off was Nick Nolte as Bruce Banner's father. Nolte used to be a revered actor, but now he's reduced himself to mugshots and box office bombs. When Nolte's character is in a conversation with someone, he is quite dull and dry. However, when he is yelling or something intense is happening, Nolte goes over the top. No one actor in the film can find a balance between too little acting and overacting.In the end, it's best to look back on Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" with a very open mind. Most fans of the film are fans of Ang Lee's previous works, such as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". This could be why fans and viewers are turned off by the film- Ang Lee's cinematic style simply doesn't fit in a comic book movie. Comic book fans and myself alike want a Hulk film to be about the monster destroying everything in sight. Sadly, it isn't this movie. As ambitious as it was, ""Hulk"" sadly didn't deliver. The combination of pretentious direction, scrambled editing, dated special effects, and rigid acting is sure to leave a bad taste in anyone's mouth. But if you're feeling adventurous and want to explore Marvel's not-so treasured cinematic past, I'd say 'go for it'.",Hulk

1115,s-kubrick,"Terrible Marketing, Great Film",9,3 June 2005,"""Hulk"" is a film which is widely considered a failure, both financially and artistically. Yet in the latter category this movie has a lot on offer: masterful editing, good acting and the direction of a true master. What Ang Lee has tried to achieve, namely merging the pulp-story of the Hulk with the scale and drama of a Greek tragedy has been well achieved. The scope of the story and its effects on the characters are only to be taken seriously on a truly grand scale, and by supplying the protagonists with interwoven back-stories Lee and his screenwriters are making it clear that this is not to be seen as a realistic story, but an epic metaphor. Special kudos goes to Timothy Squyres, who does one marvelous job of creating an editing similar to a comic's design. This pays tribute to the source material's pulp origins as well making an impressive visual statement. ""Hulk"" looks and feels like no other film, which makes it one of the most interesting, if not one of the best comic- adaptations of all time. The crux is that this movie does not know who it's aimed at. The intellectual Ang Lee- connoisseur picks his nose when it comes to the Hulk, simply due to its humble roots, while the average popcorn-cinema-goer is slightly irritated when confronted with the films ""odd"" approach to comic-movies. This means that only viewers which are a bit of both can truly appreciate this masterpiece. All the other elements for a good piece of entertainment are there and present: Eric Bana is, as usual, fine as the tormented soul which manifests itself in green rage, Jennifer Connelly is as solid as ever and Nick Nolte steals the show with what is a truly weird turn as Bruce Banner's/the Hulk's dad. The visual effects are beautifully executed as well. There is not much left to be desired.It's a pity such an interesting and brave film gets a rating of slightly above 6 at IMDb.",Hulk
1116,tshamey,"Finally a movie came along to replace ""Disorderlies"" as the WORST movie I EVER saw!",1,12 March 2005,"I don't even know what to say about this movie. Since I was a kid I LOVED the Incredible Hulk. It seemed that, after the Batman fiascoes that Warner Brothers put out, the movies were getting it right with superhero films such as ""Spider-Man"" and ""X Men"". So, when I found out they were making ""The Hulk"", I was REALLY excited. The teaser looked good: Basically the side of Banner's house exploding outward as a result of him turning into the Hulk. Then I saw the REAL trailer.Sweet Jesus, who made this movie? Who wrote the script? Who gave the damn thing the green light and, for the love of God, why did ANY of the actor's think it was a good idea? The beginning was nothing short of excruciating - The film CRAWLS!!! I mean, I know that building the background story and the suspense to see the Hulk is important, but this just seemed tangential. Who cares?What makes things worse is that there is no pay-off for the viewer's patience. It is unbelievable and unforgivable that in 2003 a movie could come out with CGI so SHOCKINGLY bad. It is IMPOSSIBLE to take this movie seriously. You CANNOT suspend disbelief. Maybe I am being too harsh. Nick Nolte as a mug shot come to life is mildly amusing and I guess I am glad that Sam Elliot was finally able to make a movie that makes him proud of his work in ""Roadhouse"".Look, I am sure that no one is even READING this scathing review.

1117,pirate_1i,"A great movie, innovative elements, not for the simple-minded",9,5 June 2005,"Hulk was one of the most interesting cinematic experiences of 2003. It was also underrated and IMHO maligned by critics who didn't like the fact that the movie had some intelligence wired in. Truth is, even if the film had pandered to the simplest, stupidest, ""Hulk Smash"" element, it would have been panned as too juvenile. Rather than expecting the character from the early 1970s (e.g., Bill Bixby's alter-ego), think of a classic combination of old Universal monsters (Frankenstein - an inspiration of the character, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, Hunchback of Notre Dame) and throw in some powerfully elemental Oedipal issues, shake well, and enjoy the fireworks. That's what it's all about - and for those open to think about it - it works!On top of that, the performances were great, especially from Nick Nolte, Sam Elliot, and Jennifer Connelly. I think Eric Bana did a good job as well; face it - he was meant to be the vulnerable, geeky straight-man to the Green Goliath. Not the kind of part the brings the range of Jack Nicholson or Robin Williams to mind.The effects were truly remarkable. Hulk himself exceeded most expectations. The style and cinematography - split screens, morphing elements transitioning between scenes - were VERY impressive and helped bridge the comic book lore with the live action.

The hulk looked fine and they really captured the strength and power of the character unlike any other superhero movie I've seen. You could just tell he would whoop up on the movie superman.

Hulk is probably one of the best comic adaptation ever made ""but"" it asks the viewer an exceptional maturity and a certain capacity to accept the conventions to be tumbled down.

A very few people seemed to realize the difficulties that Ang lee had to deal with, directing the movie adapted from the misadventures of the first super hero whose the enemy would be his own nature.For the action sequences, Lee did put entire pages of the original comic book in motion. All the fierce power of the creature is there, treated in such a way that the viewer is like in the core of the action, to make him/her intimately feel the visual fury.The best proof of the greatness of this film is the way it influence, without no one ever noticed, critically acclaimed followers like ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""Batman Begins"".Thank you Mr Lee.",Hulk

I'm saw the Hulk through the untrained eyes of a non comic book reader and despite what they'll say about ""appreciating it more if you read the comics"", I liked the movie already as it is.My friends told me that it was ""corny"" so I didn't watch it in the theaters. Now that I've seen it though, I realize that I should've paid a hundred pesos (roughly US$2). This one is one of those movies you SHOULD have watched in the theatre! So OK, some comic book fans didn't like it. Why? They wanted ACTION when this movie screamed that it was like a DRAMA. For an hour and a half movie, the story build-up between all the characters was well justified. There were added subplots of Hulk's disturbing family traumas tied up with memories the same as his lover Betty Ross. You won't get your usual ""movie"" feel watching The Hulk---you'll get a general ""comic book"" feel which is why I've forgiven it being too ""story"" and not the ""action"" movie. This is how I like to see most of my comic-book-movie-adaptations---into a movie with a comic-y feel.Whaaa? ""Comic Book Feel""?? YES, ""comic book feel"" through cool and well-thought *montage sequences* and cartoony/sci-fi-shows-like *scene transitions*. the opening scene will show you a very scientific but easy-to-understand montage sequence of the Hulk's origins and mad scientist father. It feels very ""sci-fi"" but then, you'll notice the transitions into the next scenes are very creative and this gives you your ""comic book feel"". Objects blends into the background to introduce the next, or the cameras from a macro-ed object zoom out to introduce a new setting--and these are just examples. I was struck at the effort the post-production editors put into this movie because only few movies only bother with creative screen transitions like here.I felt the emotion of this movie well because I was pretty engrossed at Eric Bana's portrayal of the Hulk. Yuh, I'm a girl and he's, like, gorgeous so I'm apt to like him but his performance justified the Hulk well enough for me. He was agonized and confused--I could see these emotions and more in his eyes as the movie patiently shows you the gradual ""Hulk"" transformation. Jennifer Connelly is already a good actress so I'll spare you guys the details of how I liked her as someone to be like. Bottom lines: Bana and Connelly work. I didn't find their love partnership sickening compared to other superhero love pairs like Batman Begin's Bale-Holmes.Admittedly, there are a LOT of noticeable inconsistencies in this movie (like CGI scenes of exploding green monster blood, and yet there's no stain where the blood landed). A bit of those ""corny"" scenes are also strewn in the story, like in one where the military, the SWAT, the police and everybody else comes together in one screen to catch the Hulk which proves to be an overkill. These things show the makings of a floppy film (scene/story inconsistencies and clichés) but I still recommend this movie.It's the effort the movie makers put in The Hulk in attempt to re-introduce comic books into the mainstream that makes this movie a must-see. I think it's the reason why they elaborated on an exaggerated storyline and worked haphazardly in shooting. I like to believe that they did well within the budget/time restrictions in this movie. I don't really care whether you see it on a boot-leg copy (like what's too rampant in my country), a rented one, or a bought CD-- just spare some time to SEE IT.On a side note: The special DVD collection is worth buying because there are ACTUAL features in it (not just deleted scenes or actor profiles). You're seeing the Hulk (scenes) rendered into actual comics from representative comic book artists, the anatomy of the Hulk, an Ang Lee directing tribute, the making of the movie, and the making of the crazy dogs CGI scene, among its cool extra features. ^_^",Hulk
1127,lauriejam,disappointing,3,18 February 2007,have to say i was incredibly disappointed by this film. i thought the visual effects were stunning and exceptional but i think it was a poor choice with Ang lee as the director ( hulk is no Jane Austen novel like sense and sensibility) i found that lee tried to make more of the character than was needed . HUlK SMASH was all i wanted to see - not emotional issues with daddy the whole plot with banners father was just unnecessarily complicated - o and the mutant dogs just were ridiculous - stick with planes and tanks. Eric Banna though was good as the hulk and i think i would very happily see a sequel as long as it was just a good action movie.,Hulk
1128,jackleecomics,Hulk 2003,10,4 August 2017,"I should mention that this film was influenced by the comics ""The Incredible Hulk"" (may, 1962) The film took the main idea of this character from the original comics and focused on the relations between Bruce Banner and his father. It emphasized the complexed relations between Bruce and his father. This movie is relatively slow, and hence it is difficult for people to be attached to it. This is not a sufficient reason for the negative criticism of many regarding this film. Few critics did not like Nik Nolte's performance, but we should remember that this character did not have its significant role in comics at all So that this very character was full modified only in our film and spectators do identify with it easily the interrelationships between Betty and her father were unique and interesting. Moreover, it enabled a comparative examination between the two sets of relationships - Banner and his father and Betty and her father We see that the two fathers acted against their families in spite of the fact that they present their activities as right and proper Betty's father is trying to stop Banner's father from his experiments in his wife and his son it designates him as the ""good family person"" but in the continuation, we realize his terrible activity when he tries to use the scientist's son as a kind of a weapon, and all that in spite of the fact that he knew that his daughter Betty was his colleague and his ex-girlfriend. Bruce's father made medical experiments in his daughter and her boyfriend...and his wife based upon the belief that it helped them. In fact, both fathers acted from their own interests and not based upon family care.",Hulk
1129,VoteForTarantino,Terrible Movie,1,18 August 2006,"I was excited to go see this, but after the first 20 minutes I was ready to leave. And then it got worse. The fight scenes were semi-enjoyable but I could not stand the rest of it. There were completely pointless flashbacks inside of flashbacks that had me bored out of my mind. It seemed to me that all the people were saying was, ""There's something inside of you and it was just waiting to be released."" I got the point after the first time, but for every other character in the movie to say something along those lines was just ridiculous. I honestly don't see how anyone could like this movie, but then again some people liked ""Date Movie.""",Hulk
1130,moonknight-3,Awful directing,1,2 December 2005,"I was very disappointed when I finished watching this movie, why? first and main thing that really bothers me is,that the direction of this movie is terrible, the director constantly opens 4, 5 or even more frames of action within the screen at once, you end up seeing nothing, because you don't know where to look at, and the screens are too small, its utterly confusing and also anti-climactic. I assume the director wanted to create a ""comic"" effect or something, but all he achieved was confusion that makes no sense and is not justified at all.I also had trouble understanding anything that nick nolte said throughout the entire movie, his distorted ultra low voice sounds like an old car running on this movie, or like a dog with a bad case of cough, they should have subtitled his lines. Jennifer connely usually has a good actress rep. but her betty role here was disappointing to me, she is supposed to love Bruce Banner but doesn't act too concerned when the army is using their whole bomb arsenal on him.the effects of the hulk were good,although the Hulk isn't as unstoppable as I would have liked to see him, but that's alright,anyway, as I said, the visuals are good but there's so many things that make this movie so.. soo... BAD.the story until the middle or so of the movie is not so bad and pretty much follow's the Hulks original comic story, but after a while, your oh so ""creative"" Hollywood script writers come up with absolutely vomitive ideas that result in something a 4 year old could have written. the ending was really bad, and also, hard to understand what the hell happened there.. it seemed like a totally improvised ""well, we gotta end this somehow"" type ending by those ""talented"" scriptwriters who get payed the big bucks.if you're a fan of the Hulk, watch it for fun, but I personally got disappointed,. but well, what would you except? the ""normal"" result of comic book based movies, is usually,. garbage.",Hulk
1131,thomasdrewsen,Partly wonderful,7,10 December 2005,"Saw The Hulk again yesterday and loved the first part of the film, including the crazy dogfight (best scene in the film, to me). After that it goes a little too much cops and robbers, if y'know what I mean, although the tank-bashing and some of the bullet-diving are rather cool. After the dogfight, however, only Nick Nolte really saves the film, from his wonderful initial transformation to his Oscar-worthy 'father-TO-son' chat later on... Though The Hulk is a slow builder, it's still partly a wonderful adaptation of a superhero comic book. Ang Lee is very interested in character development and in showing us some of the coolest images ever - very superhero'ish. By the way - they should've chosen Eric Bana for Superman! He displays some of the same innocence as the late Christopher Reeve. Bana's an obvious Clark Kent/Superman (just as Connie Nielsen would have been the obvious choice for Susan Richards in The Fantastic Four (bad casting all over)- check her out in Gladiator, you'll see what I mean. But hey! That's another story...)",Hulk
1132,LupinsLover87,It had potential,5,21 May 2006,"I tried not to be biased when I stood in my local video store debating whether or not to purchase The Hulk. I had never read a review for it, but I had heard so many people I knew say that it was terrible. Now that I've seen it, I have to admit that they were half right. But despite what I had heard about it, I bought it anyway (it was only $8 so I had nothing to lose). When Fantastic Four, another Marvel creation, came out, I was told that it was bad as well, but in all actuality, I loved it when I rented it, so in the case of The Hulk, I thought ""maybe they're wrong."" I don't feel that it was the worst movie that I had ever seen, since I have seen worse, but lets just say that it could have been much better than it was. Since there were some things I enjoyed about it, I'll start off with those.First there's the acting. I think Eric Bana did a wonderful job with what he was given, as did Nick Nolte. Eric Bana's pre-Hulk rage seemed almost as if the actor himself was really going to change into the green monster, and Nick Nolte had the deranged psycho look down to an exact science (no pun intended). Sam Elliot also did a good job with playing the worrying father, as well as the stern general. Jennifer Connelly's performance on the other hand, felt too dry and meaningless, almost as if she were bored. Same goes for Josh Lucas, who was only slightly better. However, the special effects in this movie were fantastic. Bruce Banner's transformation to The Hulk seemed very life like. And the action sequences between The Hulk and General Ross' army were very enthralling, leaving me on the edge of my seat. But my praise of the movie ends there.The first thing I noted when watching that annoyed me, and led me to believe that I probably wouldn't fully enjoy the movie, was the comic book-like split screens, which made it difficult to understand exactly what was going on. After all, how many people can watch two different things at the same time, and be able to fully understand what's going on in each of them, especially if the viewers are younger? I paid to watch a movie, not look at pictures in a comic book. Another major disappointment of mine, was that there was no humor at all. Granted, it is not a comedy, but neither was X-Men, Spiderman, or Fantastic Four, and even they had their light-hearted moments. The one attempted joke about exploding frogs didn't even get a chuckle out of me. It was just very dark, in more ways than one. During most of the action inside the military base, the lab, and the sequence with the dogs, it is too dark to even realize what is going on half the time. At first I thought it was my lamp glaring onto my television, so I turned it off, expecting it to help. It didn't.My final major problem with this movie was the story, if you can call it that. Where was it? You get a very confusing sequence of shots when Bruce is a child, a 20 second scene of him as a teenager, and then it jumps straight to him being a scientist. They give you no time to adjust to the character and learn anything about him. Ah yes, we do discover that he and Betty had some kind of relationship, but that's all. A few minutes later, they seem to work perfectly well together. If I hadn't been told that they had broken up, I would have still thought them to be together. They also don't explain the hostility between Bruce and Talbot. The two clearly don't like each other, but we have no clue why. The other issue is some major plot holes. When Bruce is in the hospital, his father tells him that that is something troublesome that he should know about Betty, but we never find out what exactly that is. Her father was the man that put Bruce's father away, but that had nothing to do with either Bruce or Betty. The other plot hole, is the fact that Bruce is a scientist. Now, since he knew nothing of his parents, or his father's line of work, it's kind of hard to believe that he would become a scientist working in the exact same field. Even General Ross noticed this. But the audience, which in the case of movies usually knows something that the other characters don't, are also clueless as to how he was motivated to study that particular branch of genetics. The movie just left more questions than answers.This film had the potential to be something great, but with a poor script, poor directing, and poor acting from some of the cast, it left me feeling like I was missing something important. If they chose to do a sequel, I will see it in hopes of them doing a better job, but I suggest that they definitely chose another director. Ang Lee may have done a good job with the dramas Sense and Sensibility and Brokeback Mountain, but he should definitely stay away from the sci-fi and action genres, as they clearly don't suit him.",Hulk
1133,joshuaspalding-52111,"Best, and least understood, comic book movie",10,3 June 2018,"This film has a solid cast and brilliant director. Ang Lee understood first of all that this was a COMIC BOOK film, explaining the cut screen in multiple scenes, as though you were reading a comic. If anyone understands the archetype of anger, they will understand this film. The film also used cutting edge CGI for it's time, to make hulk look as real as possible. In addition, the film explains briefly in the opening credits how David Banner creates the Super cell, by combining specific species genetics, and then his own. 
 Ang Lee includes the attributes that are unique to Hulk: He metamorphs when triggered by emotional stress, he becomes even larger when angrier, and his strength only increases as he becomes enraged. He can run incredibly fast, and leap incredibly far. Yes, he is incredible! His skin is resistant to great stress from bullets, tank rounds, missiles, and even nukes! His skin, if damaged, repairs itself at an alarming rate. His mind does not think clearly when he is angry. Does anyone's?
 On a side note: So how was Hulk so coherent in Ragnarok? ""He has the mind of a five yr old""? Than how the hell did he know how to fly a complex ship that took him to that distant planet?? Lame move Marvel!
With these things in mind, I must point out the great disservice marvel has also dealt Hulk in the latest installment of Avengers:Infinity war. The hyper brief battle looked like a video game clip, poorly done. Then, we never see Hulk again in the film, aside from Banner struggling to control him? Since when has Bruce Banner ever been able to control Hulk?!
Hulk will never shy from a fight. I understand that Thanos has the infinity stones, but that does not mean he can defeat Hulk in a matter of seconds, that was just insulting to Hulk's character. There is no way that the ""power stone"", packs more of a whallop than a nuclear blast. Besides, Hulk would have become enraged after that first counter attack from Thanos, and become stronger, and the fight would have continued for some time, until Thanos would eventually be destroyed by Hulk. Granted, Thanos was nearly unstoppable with all the stones, yet Thor was able to lodge his axe in Thanos chest. Which brings up another point. Odin pointed out that Miljonir was not the source of Thor's strength, so why did he need a new axe to suddenly have his power back?
Anyhoo, if you have patience and emotional intelligence, you will understand the ""angst"" this film Hulk, provides. 
Great film!",Hulk
1134,triadsnation,a beautiful film that needs to be witnessed,8,19 February 2006,this is a film that not everyone will enjoy but for me it was a very entertaining film. if you watch this expecting overblown action you will surely be disappointed because director Ang Lee focuses on emotion and story rather than the destruction. each sequence is beautifully crafted with lots of split screens to create a truly comic book feel. Ang Lee uses a lot of imagery and sometimes linger on them a bit too long but this is only a minor complaint.the pacing of the film is also great because the characters are properly fleshed out making you care for them during the action scenes. this itself is the best point of the film because most Hollywood films seems to just want to incorporate lots of action with out any care for character development whereas this film it is the main purpose.the first hour contains hardly any action but it only serves to introduces characters the second half concludes the bulk of the action which is really satisfying only the ending be a bit of a let down for it uses a lot of low key lighting.credit has to be given to the CGI team because for me they have created a truly outstanding Hulk with real facial emotions. they deserve an award for this.Eric Bana and Jennifer Conelly gives a good performance and a quite convincing but Nick knolts acting seems a bit fake.hopefully a sequel gets made because this is a truly outstanding film that is on par with x-men and spiderman. now that the characters are developed more action can be incorporated in the 2nd film which hopefully will satisfy those who criticised this.don't listen to those who says its crap. i highly recommend this film because it is a work of art with real emotions.,Hulk
1135,ohhollyhell,Just awful.,1,2 February 2019,"Earlier in day that I saw ""Hulk,"" my brother and I went to the funeral home to view my mother, who passed a over a week before and who's death was only discovered after newspapers started piling up at her front door.
