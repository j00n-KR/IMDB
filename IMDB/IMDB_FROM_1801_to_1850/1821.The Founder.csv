0,MartinHafer,Well made but a tough sell since the central figure is difficult to like.,8,4 September 2017,"""The Founder"" is a well made and interesting movie. The filmmakers had so much faith in the film that they counted on it being Oscar bait....and were apparently shocked that it didn't receive a single nomination. Why? Well, I'd bet that the film has one fatal flaw that prevented it from being better received...the central character to the story, Ray Kroc, was not an easy man to like. Selling a film that exposes him as a rather cut-throat businessman probably left more than a few people cold when the film ended.The story begins in the early 1950s. Ray Kroc is a salesman, on the road constantly, trying to sell his milkshake machines to restaurants...and without a lot of apparent success. However, when he comes upon the Dick and Mac McDonald and their restaurant in San Bernadino, California, Ray developed a dream...to franchise the McDonald brother's design and concept. The film is about the early rocky years getting the franchises going as well as how Ray handled his eventual success.I have no complaints about the film...it was well made and engaging. But, as I said above, the central character, Ray Kroc, was a tough sell. Although the world, and especially America, has a huge love of nostalgia, learning that the nostalgic feeling engendered by McDonald's is actually the dream of a rather amoral and scheming man. Still, it is worth seeing...just not exactly a feel good film.",The Founder
1,Leofwine_draca,Nearly as good as The Social Network,10,1 January 2018,"THE FOUNDER is a film much like Fincher's THE SOCIAL NETWORK: a business-based biopic that sounds rather dull on the page, but which turns out to be spellbinding when on the screen. It's a tale looking at the inception and growth of McDonald's in the 1950s in the hands of the ruthless salesman Ray Kroc, who saw potential in a small business and made it into the franchise it is today. The film is lengthy but perfectly made with just the right pace, and the acting from the principal players is exemplary: Michael Keaton is fully enjoying his career renaissance and as good as he was in SPOTLIGHT, while John Carroll Lynch brings the same heart to the film as he did to FARGO. As with THE SOCIAL NETWORK, this turns out to be less about business and success than about the human capacity for greed and ruthlessness, and man's ability to step on his fellow man in order to reach the top of the ladder. It's remarkably engaging.",The Founder
2,SnoopyStyle,fine and enlightening,6,11 November 2017,"Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) is a traveling salesman selling his milkshake mixer one restaurant at a time. The hours are long and so are the miles. His wife Ethel (Laura Dern) is tired of his long absences. He faces endless rejections and financial difficulties. The roadside burger places have long waits and many problems. He's surprised by a large order. He goes to San Bernardino, California to meet brothers Dick (Nick Offerman) and Mac McDonald (John Carroll Lynch). They have created an assembly line of the modern fast food restaurant. Ray joins the brothers to franchise the business but eventually disputes leads Ray to take the company from its founders.This is fine and enlightening. It lays out the character well but something is unsatisfying. Ray Kroc's journey is not a fun or enjoyable one. His success is not something I have a rooting interest. He really should start the movie with a bit of ruthlessness. Instead, he is downtrodden and his first time at McDonald is wide-eyed. It's too light at the beginning. It needs a little bit of darkness to foreshadow the coming storm. This movie needs to be about the fight between Ray and the brothers. Even if the movie needs to be told in flashbacks. His marriage breakdown is secondary. The structure needs some rework to increase the intensity and make it more than this straight traditional biopic.There is a need to tie his journey up in a nice bow and the movie decides to zero in on the name. Why did Kroc go with the brothers in the beginning? The movie claims that he wanted to steal their name. It's poetic and works well as a literary device but it doesn't really hold up to scrutiny. This is really a breakdown of a business relationship. This should be the story of these three men's connection.",The Founder
3,Horst_In_Translation,The fox in the hen house,6,28 May 2017,"""The Founder"" is an American live action film from 2016, so still a really fresh and new film. The director is John Lee Hancock thanks to whom Sandra Bullock is an Oscar winner right now, but he did not come up with the script here as the screenplay is by Robert D. Siegel, who proves once again how good he is when it comes to writing strong male lead characters as he has done as well in ""The Wrestler"" for example. The center of it all here is of course Michael Keaton, who keeps continuing with his strong phase after ""Birdman"" and ""Spotlight"". And even if this film we have here will probably not win another Best Picture Academy Award, it is still a really relevant and successful achievement I must say. It runs for almost two hours and this is quite a massive runtime where I would say it is pretty respectable that the film did not drag at all. Quite the opposite is the case: The longer the film went, the better it became, not just because not only Keaton got baitier and baitier material, but also because the story in general became more thrilling and interesting with Croc's rise to power. Major supporting players here are Oscar nominee Laura Dern (quite good she was) as well as Nick Offerman (Parks and Rec fans will love it) and John Carroll Lynch who really surprised me positively with his performance that was really good although he did not have that much to work with compared to some of the others, especially in terms of the amount of dialog.Anyway, I can only say that I enjoyed the watch a lot and I also recommend this film to people with an interest in business as there is major focus on this subject. I would not say that it is secondary that this is about McDonalds as there are references about food on many occasions like the one about powder replacing ice, but still I felt that the financial aspect and the business references were much more in the center here. Fittingly, you also don't see burgers and coke etc. as often as you may think you would. Another really crucial component here, however, is the character of Ray Croc and how he degenerates more and more morally. There are many really smart references in terms of that, also away from his rise in business, for example the quote about breaking hearts and contracts that comes right before the switch to the divorce announcement. Or the final scenes with the McDonald brothers where they are truly humiliated when they have to give up their name for example or how he mocks Offerman's character at the toilet room. There are many more examples and you will recognize them when you see them. It's really well done. And I also think that Keaton was the perfect choice for the role and I honestly would be perfectly fine with him getting another nomination for his portrayal here, if the film does not count for last awards season still. Then he still should have gotten a nom. So yeah, had the first half been as good as the second half then I would say it is one of the best 2016 films. The way it actually turned out, it is still one of the better films of 2016. I also loved the parallels between Croc and McDonald's, the idea of speed, the ruthlessness (he wants that younger blonde woman, he takes her), the sacrifice of quality and security for profit and so on. Don't miss out.",The Founder
4,Prismark10,The Founder,6,12 April 2021,"A fictionalised retelling of how Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton), a perennial salesman, managed to make McDonald's the largest fast food outlet in the world.In 1954 Ray encounters the McDonald brothers, Dick (Nick Offerman) and Mac (John Carroll Lynch) who ordered eight milkshake making machines.Ray has problem selling just one of these so he travels to San Bernardino to meet the brothers. He eats their hamburgers and is taken aback with the fast food service all served in a cardboard boxes in a paper bagWhen the brothers explain the philosophy of their McDonald's concept. Ray is a zealous convert and sees a chance to expand. This is just the opportunity he has been searching for all his life.Ray has persistence and a fighting spirit that the brothers lack. It is the beginning of the McDonald's Corporation and the brothers are eventually sidelined.The Founder is framed in the language of a Dale Carnegie salesman book. Kroc is all buzzwords such as persistence.The film is at its best when the McDonald brothers tell their story. Each time Dick and Mac is on, the film has a heart. Ray Kroc's story is just not as interesting in comparison and the director John Lee Hancock realised this.Nowadays Ray Kroc is regarded as a smiling shark toothed hustler who cheated Dick and Mac out of millions.The truth is really in the middle. Without Ray Kroc it is doubtful if McDonald's would has made much of an inroad from the west coast never mind the rest of the world.Dick McDonald was the last of the trio to die. He said he was happy to be bought out. He had one million dollars, a nice house and bought a new cadillac each year. He did not have to worry about money for the rest of his life.If he stayed with Kroc he would had got ulcers and would had needed eight tax attorneys to figure out how to pay his taxes each year.",The Founder
5,nogodnomasters,"Crosses, flags, arches",8,26 July 2017,"This is a kinder gentler version of McDonalds' owner Ray Kroc. The film concentrates on his early years as a struggling Prince Castle Multi-Mixer salesman, whose product was killed by Hamilton mixers. Upon visiting the McDonalds' store in San Bernardino, Ray became their franchise manager eventually taking over the whole operation from the McDonald brothers. The film shows him married to Ethel (Laura Dern) meeting Joan, (Linda Cardellini) a married woman and in the end married to Joan without much drama. He had divorced Ethel in 1961, married Jane Dobbins Green who he divorced in 1968 and then he married Joan. Michael Keaton makes Ray a likable business vulture.Guide: 1 F-word.

6,kosmasp,Found it,8,14 August 2017,"Or not, but sometimes it's about promoting and other stuff rather than being first. It's also about perception and about marketing. And about going for it as hard as you can. And the saying is, that history will only remember winners. On the other hand, movies have proved that there is a place for ""losers"" too.Now the movie itself is not so much about McDonalds itself as you may think. It's more about how it spread all over America. And all the obstacles it had to pass to come to that point. And with Michael Keaton you do have a star/actor who can carry this role. A very difficult one to pull off. Because he has to make it believable that he is pushing and never letting go off his dream. Even though even he has doubts of course.There is a fine line between liking a character and seeing their flaws as unforgivable. It all makes sense though and Michael is the ""hero"" of the movie. So if you like Drama and tension and the pursuit of your dreams ... This one will be the one to watch. Hopefully you don't draw the wrong conclusions from that",The Founder
7,classicsoncall,"""It's America's greatest food value!""",7,22 July 2019,"It's interesting reading the other reviewers for ""The Founder"" here on IMDb. One calls the '1954' Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) a washed up salesman, another describes his appetite for success. The film doesn't flinch in it's depiction of Kroc as a ruthless businessman who virtually eliminated the original McDonald Brothers from their creation to turn McDonald's into a hugely successful franchise and a veritable household name. Kroc's business acumen accurately foresaw the incredible acceptance of fast food in an increasingly fast paced American lifestyle, and was more than eager to do something about it. I had to marvel at the way Kroc maneuvered his way around Dick McDonald (Nick Offerman) and his brother Mac (John Carroll Lynch), a pair of honest, hard working siblings whose vision and perseverance created a 'Speedy System' for delivering hamburgers, french fries and soft drinks. What I wasn't too keen about was the way he reneged on his handshake deal with the brothers to deliver one percent of the franchise profits in perpetuity. I believe it still matters that a man's word should be his bond, and in that respect, Kroc proved to be a despicable human being. The ultimate irony for the McDonald Brothers was that they lost their family run business when they gave up the rights to their own name. Such is the cutthroat nature of big business and the path to wealth. The same thing happened to Famous Amos.",The Founder
8,lee_eisenberg,the beginning of industrialized food,10,1 August 2017,"One of the things that Eric Schlosser noted in ""Fast Food Nation"" is that how we eat has changed more since the end of World War II than in all previous history combined. ""The Founder"" makes that clear. At the start, Ray Kroc is a typical salesman offering businesses milkshake mixers. But everything changes when he comes across a burger joint operated by a pair of brothers in southern California. While Dick and Mac McDonald were all about serving customers the burgers, Kroc proposed franchising it. Before too long, Kroc saw it more and more as a way to simply make money no matter what.The movie plays with the audience. On the one hand, Kroc's actions suggest a man who has absolutely no qualms about what he does (he even says that if his business rival were drowning, he would put a water hose in the latter's throat). But at the same time, the viewer roots for him to succeed, even though we know that McDonald's did eventually become a worldwide conglomerate. Basically, the prospect of making money can turn anyone ruthless.The main credit should go to Michael Keaton as Ray Kroc. He continues his comeback by portraying Kroc as a someone whose nice demeanor hides Machiavellian schemes. In supporting roles we have Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch as Dick and Mac McDonald, respectively; the brothers realize too late that they can't control what their business partner does. There's also Laura Dern as Kroc's first wife Ethel, whom he ignores, and Linda Cardellini as Joan, a woman whom he begins to admire.In conclusion, I recommend the movie not only as a look at this particular story, but as a reminder of the dark side of the American dream.",The Founder
9,jboothmillard,The Founder,8,22 February 2017,"""Look after the customer and the business will take care of itself"", these are the words of the man who supersized a small restaurant business into the multi-million worldwide fast food chain we know today, I was instantly excited when I saw the trailer for this film, directed by John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side, Saving Mr. Banks). Basically in 1954, Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) is a travelling salesman selling milkshake makers, his wife Ethel (Laura Dern) is supportive, and he saved enough for a comfortable life, but he craves much more. Ray is surprised to receive a call for a big order of milkshake makers for a restaurant in San Bernardino, he drives to California to see it, there he finds McDonald's, a highly popular fast food restaurant, he is amazed with the fast service, good quality food, disposable packaging and a family clientele. Ray meets the two McDonald brothers, Maurice ""Mac"" McDonald (John Carroll Lynch) and Richard ""Dick"" McDonald (Nick Offerman), after touring the kitchen and seeing the strong employee work ethic Ray takes the brothers to dinner to hear how their business started, they explain every aspect from their beginnings to the growing success of their diner. The next day, Ray suggests franchising the restaurant, the brothers explain that they attempted to do so, but with absent owners and inconsistent standards they were unsuccessful, Ray convinces them to let him lead their franchising efforts, he also hopes to incorporate their image of restaurants with Golden Arches, they have Ray sign a contract agreeing that all changes receive their approval. Ray initially attempts to entice wealthy investors to open franchises, but meets with the same problems as the brothers' original efforts, he is successful when franchising to middle class investors, willing to follow the McDonald's formula. New franchises begin opening across the Midwest, with Ray representing himself as the creator of McDonald's, during this time he also meets Rollie Smith (Patrick Wilson), a restaurant owner in Minnesota who wishes to invest, Ray is immediately attracted to Smith's wife Joan (Linda Cardellini). Despite his success, due to his contract, Ray runs into financial difficulty with his share of franchise profits, the owners themselves are encountering higher costs, particularly refrigerating large quantities of ice cream for milkshakes, Joan shows Ray a powdered milkshake that could cut these costs, but the brothers refuse to compromise with this substitute. Ray is unable to negotiate a loan, but his conversation is overheard by Harry Sonneborn (B.J. Novak), a financial consultant for Tastee Freeze, reviewing Ray's book Sonneborn sees that the profit is actually to be made in real estate, the franchisees will not only provide a revenue stream, but provide leverage over his franchisees and over the McDonald brothers, new investors are attracted in Ray's new company, Franchise Realty Corporation. Ray is now bolder, increasingly defiant of the McDonald brothers and bypasses their authority, including providing powdered milkshakes to all franchisees, eventually Ray renames the company The McDonald's Corporation and demands to be released from the contract and buy the brothers out. Ray now has higher power over the McDonald brothers and their original business, they eventually agree to a $2.7 million lump sum payment, but Ray refuses to include royalties in the settlement. After Mac has recovered from diabetic shock, and the handshake agreement has taken place, Dick asks Ray why he took over their business and didn't attempt to steal their idea and recreate it, Ray reveals that it is the name McDonald's that is the true value, it sums up the glory of America. In the end the McDonald brothers are forced to take their name off the original restaurant, Ray opens a new McDonald's franchise across the street to finally put them out of business, it ends in 1970 when Ray has truly established himself as the ""founder"" of McDonald's, and has an elaborate mansion with new wife Joan, the McDonald brothers were never paid their royalties. Also starring Justin Randell Brooke as Fred Turner, Kate Kneeland as June Martino and Wilbur Fitzgerald as Jerry Cullen. Keaton is absolutely captivating as the downtrodden salesman who spotted a opportunity and turned into a global money spinning franchise, by the end he is an anti-hero, you can obviously praise his ambition, but he does become a greedy bastard, and you feel sorry for the wholesome brothers played well Offerman and Lynch. Most of what I knew about McDonald's, besides the tasty food (Big Mac, McNuggets, fries, etc), was what I had seen in Morgan Spurlock documentary Super Size Me, the film works really well as a story about how something small becomes something massive, and the ruthlessness of business, with a great witty script, you may not think of the Golden Arches the same way again, a delicious, full-flavoured and most satisfactory biographical drama. Very good!",The Founder
10,moonspinner55,Michael Keaton in the tale of the Golden Arches...a hard sell,6,22 June 2017,"True story of Ray Kroc, fast-talking food service industry salesman in mid-1950s America who befriends the McDonald brothers, fledgling restaurateurs in Southern California who have opened a successful hamburger-fries-and-shakes eatery in San Bernardino. Kroc sees their need to branch out and appoints himself their franchising savior--whether they like it or not. Glossy-coated character study from director John Lee Hancock and screenwriter Robert D. Siegel covers the not-uninteresting business angle of early McDonald's--with Keaton's Kroc as the fox in the hen house--but the bank loans, the hiring of franchisees and the legal meetings and entanglements tend to congeal in one's memory. This material might have been perfect for a cable movie, but on the big screen it lacks excitement (although the editing darts around, catching expressions on the fly, trying to create a buzz). The production design is handsome (if occasionally inaccurate), Keaton works hard at playing a likable sonuvabitch, and the supporting cast is solid.

12,zardoz-13,The Dark Side of Capitalism and the American Dream,7,15 September 2017,"Michael Keaton delivers a tour-de-force performance as a hero and a villain in director John Lee Hancock's cynical business biopic ""The Founder,"" about real-life Ray Kroc who discovered the McDonald brother's hamburger joint in San Bernardino, California, and took it far beyond their dreams. Initially, Keaton's Kroc toils for a living as an unfulfilled, Illinois-based milkshake-mixer salesman who lugs his unwieldy contraption around from one business to another in a woebegone effort to sell it with success. Indeed, Keaton evokes images of Willy Loman from ""Death of a Salesman"" as he appears to get nowhere. ""The Founder"" takes place in the early 1950s, and ""Saving Mr. Banks"" helmer John Lee Hancock takes us back in time to witness the changes that revolutionized the fast-food business. After repeated setbacks to sell the milkshake-mixer with his repetitive line: ""You increase the supply, and the demand will follow... Increase supply, demand follows.,"" our beleaguered protagonist learns that the McDonald brothers in California have ordered six of them. An incredulous Kroc phones them because he is sure that his secretary has made a mistake about the order, and he learns that the brothers now need eight instead of six. Kroc puts the mixers in the mail and cruises out to the West Coast to take a gander at their restaurant. What Kroc sees astonishes him beyond his wildest dreams. Dick (Nick Offerman of ""22 Jump Street"") and Mac McDonald (John Carroll Lynch of ""Face/Off"") have perfected the fast-food business through considerable trial and error. They cook hamburgers every 30 thirty seconds, and they have whittled down their menu to burgers, fries, drinks, and milk shakes. The moment that Kroc eyeballs their operation, it is like nothing that he has ever imagined, and he wants to be a part of their business. Actually, in real life, Kroc saw something that he could franchise, and he struggled for years against the McDonald brothers whose fair play values grated against his cut-throat business initiative. At one point, in an effort to triumphant against the competition, Kroc spells it out for the McDonalds, ""If I saw a competitor drowning, I'd shove a hose down his throat."" Ray Kroc is reminiscent of Alec Baldwin's unsavory salesman in David Mamet's who has no sympathy for anybody who cannot cut the mustard in the sales business. In one respect, ""The Founder"" celebrates the triumphant of capitalism, particularly in the story of the McDonalds, and then Hancock and scenarist Robert D. Siegel of ""The Wrestler"" show us the dark side of capitalism. Kroc embarks on a hostile takeover of the McDonald's business when they stonewall him in his efforts to expand the number of stores and spearhead innovations.",The Founder

Keaton gives a bravura turn as Ray Kroc the destined for greatness as the CEO of McDonald's but the titular signature is dubious at best in this biopic of the American Dream run amok with Kroc as a 1950's wash-up salesman who comes upon a needle in a haystack - the McDonald brothers burger stand - and sees dollar bills and a mecca to build come what may. Director John Lee Hancock assuredly handles the proceedings at hand to show how greed and avarice often is not punished or even acknowledged after the fact but Robert D.

Who knew a film about McDonald's would be this interesting? Of course Michael Keaton has no problem diving into the character of wheeler dealer Ray Kroc. His perfect foil is Nick Offerman as Dick McDonald, deadpan, a solid rock of a man with strong ideas about integrity. John Carroll Lynch as Mac McDonald, Dick's brother, a taller but more accommodating man, is also outstanding. Linda Cardinelli as Joan Smith, eventually to be Joan Kroc, is quite lovely and looks good in the period costumes. At the end of the film Kroc offers what are now, I believe, called ""alternative facts"" about the founding of McDonald's. The film is very much about two different visions of America as reflected in two different approaches to business.

16,ferguson-6,Kroc took their lunch money,7,19 January 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. How you define success will likely determine your interpretation of this film that is every bit as much about the humble beginnings and explosive growth of McDonalds as it is a biopic of Ray Kroc, the self-professed ""founder"" of the golden arches empire. Capitalism and its corresponding businessmen have not typically been favorably portrayed by Hollywood in such films as The Social Network, Wall Street, Glengarry Glen Ross, Steve Jobs and The Wolf of Wall Street. This latest from director John Lee Hancock (Saving Mr. Banks, The Blind Side) and writer Robert Siegel (The Wrestler) is no exception, and it's obvious why.It's 1954 when we first catch up with Ray Kroc (as played by Michael Keaton). He's the type of travelling salesman who totes around his latest widget (a multiple milkshake machine), rehearses and polishes his spiel (via extreme close-up), and listens to motivational record albums that preach the importance of persistence, while he stays at roadside motels that act as his home away from home. Kroc doggedly pursues the American dream, and optimistically bounces from one project to another  convinced that he's found ""the next big thing"".When circumstance leads him to a crowded little octagonal burger shop in San Bernardino, Kroc becomes fascinated with its simplicity and success. Over dinner, Dick (Nick Offerman) and Mac (John Carroll Lynch) McDonald detail the Spee-Dee kitchen design and unique focus on quality, consistency and speed that today is considered the starting line of the fast-food industry. The tennis court sequence is especially creative and fun to watch. While the brothers prefer to keep the business small and remain in control, Kroc pitches his vision of franchising  a pitch with emphasis on ""Crosses. Flags. Arches"".The full story is likely one most people don't know  despite the fact that McDonalds now feeds 1% of the world population each day (a statistic posted on screen). The relationship between Kroc and the McDonald brothers was never a smooth one, and it's a perfect example of dog-eat-dog, or unprincipled vs idealistic. Kroc sees himself as a ""winner"", while it's likely most will view his actions as unscrupulous, even if legal.Keaton's performance accurately captures a man who is impatiently ambitious, and whose confidence and ego grow incrementally as it becomes inevitable that the decency of the brothers is actually a weakness in business. Offerman and Lynch are both excellent, and other support work is provided by Laura Dern as Kroc's first and mostly neglected wife who is tossed aside when something better comes along; BJ Novak as Harry J Sonneborn, the key to Kroc's power move; Justin Randell Brooks as Fred Turner and Kate Kneeland as June Martino, two trusted employees; and Patrick Wilson as a key franchisee. Linda Cardellini (Mad Men, Bloodline) plays Joan, Ray's wife (she was actually his third) and business adviser from 1969 until his death in 1984. The film shortchanges her importance – at least until the closing credit recap.Bookending that opening extreme close-up sales pitch, is a near-conclusion zoom on Keaton's face as he prepares for an event where he will tell his story  at least his version of the story. The film does a really nice job of capturing the era. Of particular interest is that the cars don't look like they rolled right out of a classic car show, as happens with most movies. It's nice to see some faded paint and a dented fender on screen. The early McDonalds locations are beautifully and realistically replicated to provide a nostalgic look for some, and a first glimpse for others. Carter Burwell's score is complementary to the proceedings, and director Hancock deserves credit for not just making this the Michael Keaton/Ray Kroc show. Rather than serving up a Happy Meal movie, the film instead provides a somewhat toned-down historical view of ambition and drive, and the birth of an empire  one that changed our culture.",The Founder
17,FlashCallahan,The Wolf Of McDonald's.......,8,20 February 2017,"Ray Kroc was a salesman whom, in 1954, turned two brothers' innovative fast food eatery, McDonald's, into one of the biggest businesses in the world, with a combination of ambition, persistence, and a good dose ruthlessness thrown in for good measure.....Since Keaton starred in Birdman, his career has had a well earned resurgence, before that, he was support in films such as Robocop, The Other Guys, and erm... Herbie Fully Loaded.The epitome of wasted talent.But even though I do not hold high regard for Birdman, it enabled him to get roles (or buns) that he could really get his teeth into and show audiences just what a dazzling talent the man is.And here, Keaton is the sole reason to watch this film. Kroc is a desperate character, like a child in the body of a man, thinking that the world has dealt him a bad deck, and he should be bigger and more successful than he is.So he virtually stalks the McDonald's until they give in to his proposition...franchising.But Keaton not only makes the character of Kroc highly unlikable, but he makes you will him to win, because the writing makes other characters inferior to him, almost weaker than him.But it's fascinating to know that one of the biggest fast food restaurants on the planet became so big thanks to deception, selfishness, and careful plotting against two honest people.You will feel sorry for the brothers, and you will hate yourself for egging Kroc on, but all in all, it's a wonderfully insightful film.I'm Lovin' It....",The Founder
18,phd_travel,Who knew the history of McDonald's could be so interesting,9,19 June 2017,"This biopic of Ray Kroc who expanded but didn't exactly found McDonald's - (he bought it from the McDonald brothers as shown in the movie) is interesting from start to finish. The beginnings of fast food industry which changed the landscape of the country and many parts of the world.The story is well written in a straightforward non confusing manner. It clearly details the various stages and struggles in franchising raising finance and expansion and the various conflicts that can arise. Insightful contrast between old rich investors and hungry young struggling people as franchisees. Along the way the people who helped him with good ideas are shown and the poignant buyout of the people who started the first McDonald's with the innovative kitchen format.Michael Keaton sounds a bit Beetlejuice at times and he is good throughout. Enough of his personal life is shown. He is presented quite neutrally - it's shown he didn't honor his promise to pay the original brothers a percentage of profits but it comes across as just the way business is done in this country.

19,Mr-Fusion,"Likable cast, clumsy engineering",6,30 April 2017,"Not the most rewarding biopic, but if you're just in it to see Michael Keaton own all of his scenes, then you've come to the right place.""The Founder"" is pure Oscar bait, but given a cast like this, that never bothered me. But the script did, specifically the awkward tonal shift that comes somewhat late in the story. For much of the first half, it plays like a fairy tale; the origins of the first McDonald's restaurant told in the style of something like ""Saving Mr. Banks"". But gears switch quickly as soon as the franchising really picks up steam and Ray Kroc (Keaton) is a success story. From there on out, it's all dark underbelly with Kroc winning and the McDonald brothers getting nothing but the stick's short end. And that felt forced to me, that Kroc suddenly becomes a villain of the mustache-twirling variety.All of this is built on Keaton's performance, and he's ideal for the role; he's playing the huckster shtick like only he can, and that's always a treat. I don't think there was a weak member of this cast, which is also a perk. But you probably (definitely) won't look fondly on Ray Kroc once it's over, and that turn in the story isn't handled with grace.6/10",The Founder
20,namashi_1,"Michael Keaton Shines in an Entertaining, Uneven Biopic!",7,8 February 2017,"John Lee Hancock's 'The Founder' isn't as delicious or memorable as a McDonalds meal is for its customers, but its got a solid leading-man to sail through its bumps. And leading man Michael Keaton enjoys playing Ray Kroc, a rather unlikable man, with superb skill. This biopic too works, but only in parts. 'The Founder' is The story of Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton), a salesman who turned two brothers' innovative fast food eatery, McDonald's, into one of the biggest restaurant businesses in the world with a combination of ambition, persistence, and ruthlessness.'The Founder' explores Ray Kroc's journey from a traveling salesman to becoming a filthy rich businessman. His idea to turn McDonalds into a franchise & later literally taking away all the glory from its real inventors, is rather engrossing. We see a man full of ambition, skill, persistence & selfishness. Kroc is an underdog, who at the end, is the most successful scumbag you'd come across. If we have a McDonalds almost a mile away from where you may come (almost all around the world), its because Kroc, with his ruthless behavior, pushed those burgers & fries into the bloom.And 'The Founder' works best when it sticks to Kroc's obsession to McDonalds. And it works least when you have a sub-plot involving his wife (Laura Dern in a thankless role) & how his private life was a wreck. The sub-plot is weak & the sequences between Kroc & his wife, barely offer anything to the narrative. Another problem with 'The Founder' is its uneven pacing, that acts as a minus. While the film begins sharply, the narrative dips in the middle & gathers momentum towards its culmination. The pacing needed more to be consistent, considering this is a story that's nothing less than a business monument.Robert D. Siegel's Screenplay is decent. The Writing does have some interesting moments that definitely work & hold your interest, but as mentioned a bit earlier, the sub-plot doesn't work. A little crispness in the Writing would've done wonders. John Lee Hancock's Direction is good, yet again. Cinematography is passable. Editing needed to be better. Art & Costume Design are brilliantly done. Carter Burwell's Score is perfect.And now, to the strongest aspect of why 'The Founder' doesn't falter - Michael Keaton. The Legend is in complete form, yet again. Keaton, who's been a roll with 2 back-to-back Best Picture Oscar-Winners 'Birdman' (which also earned him an Oscar Nod) & 'Spotlight', keeps the momentum going with his portrayal of Kroc. He's entirely convincing in the role & shines all through. Even when the pacing goes uneven, Keaton remains unnerved. And special mentions for Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch, who co-star as McDonald's founders Richard and Maurice McDonald. Both the actors are excellent.On the whole, 'The Founder' is a decent watch, that could've been better overall. But, as far as Keaton's performance is concerned, I must say, I'm lovin' it!",The Founder
21,blanbrn,"I'm loving it! An interesting and compelling, provocative biography of an icon who would help America eat it up!",8,21 January 2017,"""McDonald's"" is by far maybe one of the biggest icons and corporations in U.S. business history, as all including billions continue to eat up on the menu. Yet many may not no the real story behind how the empire came about as the real story is about a traveling salesman and ambition, desire, and ruthlessness with persistence proves that you can get what you want. This film called ""The Founder"" is one rich in depth history type biography picture that anyone will enjoy as it's so revealing.Starting in the 1950's it looks at Ray Kroc(a fine performance from one of my favorites Michael Keaton who's still hot from ""Birdman"", and ""Spotlight"")a struggling traveling salesman from Illinois who just can't find any luck at all with selling his new made milkshake machine. So never fear one day after getting a call from two brothers Kroc makes a trip to California to visit Dick and Mac McDonald, as it's now a light has came on in Ray's head, he has an ideal to start the McDonald's restaurant as a franchise.It's with smarts and clever moving with the business deals and land buying that Kroc makes that leads to a valley of gold and it's his ideals of assembly line grills and sauce development that makes the food so good. And his design and building lay out of each chain makes McDonald's a winner, and he markets and does an advertising pitch of a golden arch to make the place so family friendly to visit and plus it's fast food ready with a drive thru.Along the way aside from these clever deals and path making days of becoming a gold mine for Kroc he's flawed as the film shows he struggles in a lonely marriage with Ethel(Laura Dern)and soon starts a new romance with his later to be wife a west coast lady named Joan Smith(Linda Cardellini). Aside from that Ray is a heavy drinker with the bottle and his schemes slowly but, surely make McDonald's one of the biggest corporations of all time, in the meantime both brothers Mac and Dick are left on the outside looking in. Overall good informative film that's historical,as it tells the rise of a business icon proving that with luck, determination, and playing tough success is possible especially if one is very strong with persistence.",The Founder
22,sddavis63,Biography Of A Guy Who Became A Real S.O.B.,9,5 May 2017,"This movie obviously has a built in, international audience to draw from. Is there anyone anywhere in any developed country (and probably more than a few undeveloped or under-developed countries) who hasn't at one time or another eaten at McDonald's? I can remember the old jingle (""McDonald's is your kind of place ..."") I can remember the old promise (""Change for a dollar."") McDonald's has a bit of a hold on the imagination of people who grew up in the western world. Remember the signs: 1 billion served. 2 billion served. 10 billion served. They stopped as far as I know at 99 billion served. ""The Founder"" takes us from the beginning through to 1970, giving us not so much the story of McDonald's (although it's there) but really the story of Ray Kroc - whose name became synonymous with McDonald's. I found it a fascinating bio-pic.It starts with Kroc as a milkshake maker salesman. He's not incredibly successful, but he does well enough that he has a nice home, and he and his wife Ethel are comfortable enough. His world begins its turn upside down when he gets an order for 8 of the machines from a hamburger stand in San Bernardino, California called ""McDonald's Hamburgers,"" run by brothers Dick and Mac McDonald. Kroc is so intrigued by the big order that he goes to California to look at the place. The brothers invite him in, give him a tour, explain how it all works. Kroc, impressed and seeing the potential for something much bigger than a hamburger stand, starts to weasel his way into the business. He first convinces the brothers to franchise, then he takes over the franchising. He starts up McDonald's back home in Illinois. It spreads through the state, then moves into the midwest and eventually national and international. He butts heads with the brothers. They're happy as guys who run a small company focused on quality. Kroc wants to make money. He starts a real estate company - owning the land that his new franchises are built on, amassing more and more power and becoming increasingly contemptuous of the brothers' values and ideas. He finally forces them out. Sure, they got $2.7 million - but that's really not much when you consider what McDonald's became. They shook hands on an agreement to pay the brothers 1% of the company's profits in perpetuity. It wasn't in writing. Kroc never lived up to that. The brothers kept their own restaurant but weren't allowed to call it ""McDonald's"" anymore - and Kroc opened a McDonald's across the street and put them out of business. It's a movie that certainly highlights the cut-throat nature and greed of capitalism that runs roughshod over small operators who don't want to play the game. And in the midst of it all, while Kroc is busy stealing the brothers' business, he also steals another man's wife. S.O.B. kind of sums up how you feel about Kroc by the time the movie comes to an end - and that's kind.But it wasn't always like that. At first, you kind of admired Kroc and rooted for him. He was a guy who worked hard and had lots of ambition and ideas. The McDonald brothers knew how to make a hamburger at breakneck speed, but didn't have that ambition. I liked them all at first, but by the time the movie ended, you definitely felt for the brothers and detested Kroc. Michael Keaton was great as Ray Kroc. He managed that transition from being a guy you admire to being a guy you despise wonderfully. He was believable in the role. I would readily call it one of the best performances I've seen him give. The brothers were played very well by Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch. Offernan's Dick was the one who constantly butted heads with Kroc, while Lynch's Mac was the one who probably felt guilty because it was through his invitation that Kroc appeared on the scene in the first place. I admired Laura Dern's performance as Kroc's first wife Ethel. She was content with marriage to a hard- working salesman, was happy enough at McDonald's success as long as it remained relatively small and family-oriented, but they drifted apart once Kroc became focused on money above all else. I was less taken with Linda Cardellini as Kroc's second wife Joan. There was nothing wrong with her performance. She just didn't become central to the story in the way that Dern did.Did any of this change my perception of McDonald's? Not really. They're a gigantic hamburger chain. I stop in periodically - usually not for hamburgers, but for something to drink. It is convenient, although you no longer get change for a dollar, and it takes more than 30 seconds to get your order. I will say, though, that I came away from this with a better understanding of how what has become a corporate behemoth actually started, and of some of the intrigue that made it what it is. And the title itself is thought-provoking. Kroc called himself the founder of McDonald's, but we all know that it was the McDonald brothers who started it. And yet, in all honesty, Kroc could lay claim to the title. In a way, he founded what became the McDonald's of today. Had the brothers remained in control, McDonald's wouldn't be in over 100 countries, and it wouldn't be feeding (as we were told in captions at the end) 1% of the world's population every day. Every. Single. Day. Think about that for a moment. Let it sink in. A truly fascinating movie. (9/10)",The Founder
23,Hellmant,Reminds me a lot of 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK'!,9,24 January 2017,"'THE FOUNDER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A biopic based on the life of Ray Kroc, and the businessman's ruthless acquisition of the McDonald's fast food franchise. It was directed by John Lee Hancock, and written by Robert Siegel; who also wrote 2008's 'THE WRESTLER' (which is one of the best movies of that year). The film stars Michael Keaton, as Ray Kroc, and it costars Nick Offerman, John Carroll Lynch, Laura Dern, Linda Cardellini, Patrick Wilson and B.J. Novak. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also performed well at the Box Office (so far). I think it's a very well made and effective movie, but it's also extremely depressing.Ray Kroc (Keaton) was a hard working, but struggling, traveling salesman. When a popular diner orders an extremely large number of milkshake makers from him, Ray decides to go visit the fast food restaurant. He's extremely impressed with the business, and he becomes obsessed with the idea of turning it into a successful franchise. The two brothers that own the restaurant, Mac (Lynch) and Nick (Offerman) McDonald, are reluctant to go into business with him; but he eventually talks them into it. Ray then becomes determined to make McDonald's a household name.The movie reminds me a lot of 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK'; except with McDonald's as the main subject, instead of Facebook. While it is funnier than that masterpiece ('THE SOCIAL NETWORK' is one of my all time favorite films), it also feels much darker, to me, and I think Kroc is a much less likable antihero as well (although Keaton gives an outstanding performance in the role). The film is a great commentary on business, in general, and capitalism (which I'm not a big supporter of) . It's also a great lesson on how life really works; how vicious, and highly immoral it all is (especially if you want to be financially comfortable). What else can you expect though, from a movie about one of the most immoral, and incredibly horrific, businesses in the world!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M9osPwjfbM",The Founder
24,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"An interesting and appealing drama, if a little under cooked",7,20 February 2017,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the early 1950s, salesman Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) is travelling around America trying to sell his milkshake machine to various catering establishments, with no success. Then he stumbles upon the McDonald's restaurant, run by brothers Dick (Nick Offerman) and Mac McDonald (John Carroll Lynch), who have developed a magnificent system that allows burgers, fries and beverages to be mass produced in record time. Initially, they establish a working bond together, but eventually Ray's ruthlessness and cut throat mentality come to rob the brothers of everything they worked for.If the history of McDonald's has no bearing on you, its legacy certainly does. Today, the franchise food chain will almost certainly have a branch on every high street or major retail outlet across the country, wherever you are, and they continue to be manned mainly by low income teenagers barely paid the minimum wage, whose exploitation has been highlighted over the years, just as they were when they started nearly half a century ago. Given this massive cultural impact that it's sustained, a dramatisation of how it all began certainly provides interesting food for thought (no pun intended.) And the name Ray Kroc sparked my attention even more, as I remembered hearing his name in Food Technology class many years ago. Given his depiction in this biopic, his name may even have come to have been used to coin such derogatory terms as 'what a kroc' and 'kroc of sh!t.' In the lead role, Keaton slips into another dynamic powerhouse role, as a man determined to succeed and driven by his theory of 'create supply and demand will follow.' Kroc is a petulant, spiteful character, who is anguished that two other people have adopted this idea and had far more success with it before him, and feeling that he is owed something, hones in like a snarling vulture on their more gentle, passive nature to take it from them. He is certainly a great example of the 'American Dream' gone bad, and John Lee Hancock's film provides a sterling show of how it all began, but you wish a little bit had gone into what it developed into, and how it was ingrained into the public conscious a little more (Ronald McDonald is not even mentioned!), and its present day position after the healthy eating scare, all of which would have given it that little extra vitality.It's generally well made, deftly acted and engaging, but, all the same, if it were a Big Mac you were nibbling on in one of those many McDonald's franchise outlets, you'd probably still send it back for being slightly underdone. ***",The Founder
25,ElMaruecan82,Founding a business is good but building the foundations of its durability better...,9,17 July 2019,"I often go to McDonald's, especially with my daughter, it's not much a product of the world's mass-market globalization but the way globalization has influenced our lives and standardized the approach to fast-food, people need to eat quick and well, and restaurants are kept for birthdays of Valentine's dates, job meetings or anniversary celebrations.It was during summer 1993 when the first McDonald's restaurant opened in Morocco, in Casablanca on the seaside. For a kid my age, it felt like going to Disney World (quite an omen knowing that a few months after, I would visit the actual place). I remember it as if it was yesterday, everything looked clean and impeccable, the hamburgers on the pictures were shiny and the names resonated like something that would come off the TV set. Then, I had my first bite on the cheeseburger, it felt like having a 'taste of America'... and it didn't taste bad.The rest is history, one couldn't count how many 'Golden Arches' are in every big city of Morocco, many kids were born with it and didn't have the privilege to taste that crispy apple pie whose cream would burn your tongue if you didn't wait long enough (I guess that's why the dessert was removed); for these children anyway, McDonalds' (which we call ""McDo"" like the French do) is part of their everyday life, anything but something to feel privileged about. ""McDo"" became part of the urban landscape and not just in countries with churches and American flags, but before going global, it had to prove its worth locally, and boy, did it deliver!I'm not praising the place as much as I praise the concept, one that proved to be in symbiosis with modern societies' expectations, to the point that the mark of modernity in an emerging country can be measured by the number of international franchises it got, McDonald's being generally among those that started them all. And I can't believe my grandmother was refused to open a McDonald's franchise back in 1981, the local bureaucracy couldn't share her visionary flair... something that echoed the journey of Ray Kroc, the titular ""Founder"" in John Lee Hancock's underrated biopic.First of all, what strikes in Ray's name is his lack of fame compared to the empire he built, we all expect McDonald's to be the creation of a guy named likewise who envisioned the fast-food chain like Bugsy did with Las Vegas or Zuckerberg Facebook, a man of guts and vision... and yet whoever made McDonald's possible wasn't meant to be praised like Steve Jobs would be, not because he didn't deserve it but because McDonald's is the result of a long process that preceded him, one that involved many protagonists until he gave that little boost it needed to definitely take off, a business masterstroke that might have looked great on the paper yet not enough to convince movie producers.It starts when the Great Depression convinced the two brothers, Dick and Mac McDonald to invest in food business because hey, ""people gotta eat"", and then they decided to have their little trademark: the Speedee-System, why bother with dishes, with fancy plates when 90% of the food goes into burgers, fries and sodas, they didn't invent the wheel, they just applied Ford theories in food business, but there's nothing like an idea ""coming from nowhere"". Anyway, we get through an exhilarating ten-minute sequence where it's both about the content than the form. I loved the way the two brothers Dick (Nick Offerman) and Mac (John Carrol Lynch) kept switching the lines like a story they've been telling countless times and you can see it from the listener how spellbinding it is.In fact, Kroc only came because they were one of the umpteenth clients he visited to sell some ice-cram multi-mixer but when Kroc learned about McDonald's, it was obvious they couldn't keep the concept for themselves. He convinces them to start making franchises and progressively, the man becomes the third parent to McDonald's... until he gets full custody, literally. I didn't expect much and I got a taste of what made the concept successful, more than any documentary, analytics would leave anyone cold, but the film treats its subject like a great story.The film doesn't glorify the brand, nor the name but the persistence that drove a man who didn't have the original idea, who didn't have an exceptional talent, but who could spot a good idea and talents when they hit him and didn't miss the opportunity. The film is straightforward and linear but is remarkably effective ... and Michael Keaton is just so good, I kept wondering where the hell was that film during the Oscar talks, I know it's not ""progressive"" to praise business values, nor that the film handles any timely subjects, but it's culturally significant and smart in a punchy way.At first sight, it's your typical business-driven success stories with a few dilemmas that force the protagonist to cut a few corners but the dynamics are good, the interactions with the brothers full of subtle comedy, and Michael Keaton is just the perfect actor for such roles. There are a few clichéd moments (Laura Dern has the thankless role as the abandoned wife) and the film works better when it gets to business. Even the title is provocative because one of the first 'a-ha' moments you get in the beginning is that Kroc didn't create McDonalds. Still, at the end, and that's why the film works, we accept him as the Founder, who bought an idea so big the creators (relegated as passive observers all through the film) couldn't handle it... it's one thing to create, but it's another to build the foundations of durability of that creation.Some would compare the film to Fincher's ""Social Network"" and they'd be right, I wish the comparison could have extended to the Oscar reception.",The Founder

31,ironhorse_iv,"While, the Founder is no Happy Meal. It did fed the hunger of knowing more of the man behind the golden arches.",7,16 February 2017,"With a great cast, great visuals, camera work, props/sets and wondering music. This film directed by John Lee Hancock indeed shows how, an unsuccessful milkshake salesman Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) turned the two McDonalds brothers', Maurice (John Carroll Lynch) & Richard (Nick Offerman)'s innovative fast food eatery, into one of the biggest restaurant businesses in the world, by seizing power. However, the film didn't quite show, everything. Don't get me wrong, without spoiling the movie, too much, for the most part, this film are very accurate to the real-life guy and his company. Yet, one of the things, this film fail to mention, is that McDonalds wasn't the first fast-food establishment like this movie acts it is. In truth, that honor goes to the Automat, a vending machine café which open in 1912. McDonalds wasn't even the first hamburger fast food establishment, as A&W, which open in 1919 & White Castle, which open in 1921, beat it to the punch. Nevertheless, McDonald was indeed, one of the first fast food restaurants to use the assembly-line system. Yet, another misleading thing that this movie put out there, was the fact that Richard McDonalds design it. It was not. Nor did he made the design for the Golden Arches. In truth, the brothers hire Southern California architect Stanley Clark Meston to design a replacement for the stand. It's here, where Meston and his assistant Charles Fish deliver the iconic Golden Arches design. Like the movie, in real-life, they barely got any credit. Also, by 1957, most of the McDonalds buildings had this design, as even the original restaurant in San Bernardino is rebuilt with a golden arches in 1957; which the film doesn't display. Another thing, this film didn't explain, was the true reason of why McDonald went on a franchise structure; which was to undermine the efforts of its workers to unionize; which was a bit factor at the time in California. Another thing, they didn't talk about, was the fact that before Kroc could open his first McDonald's in Des Plaines, Illinois, he had buy out the rights to use the McDonalds name from another company, Frejlack Ice Cream. I thought this part, should had been include in the film, as it adds to the reason why Ray Kroc was having problems with the expenses, that he could barely afford, and why the brothers and him, clash so much, over the issues of Ice Cream. Putting this minor detail, would help, bridge the gap, in logic, on why Kroc betrayed the brothers in the end. Instead, without it, it makes Kroc look like a big jerk, while the brothers, truly innocent victims. That is not the case. Despite that, I thought the supporting actors, like Lynch and Offerman did a great job, showing the brothers, unwaveringly traditional and morally resolute, even if there was barely any of that in real-life and they look a bit autism. Another misleading thing that the film has on the founders was the fact that all of them, were strict with how the business was run. While, it was true that the brothers and Kroc made rules for franchisees on how the food was to be made, portion sizes, cooking methods and others; but they barely govern it, as most of the franchisees had freedom in how to marketing themselves. It's this free range of ideas, came some of the biggest marketing ideas in history, such as Ronald McDonald, the Big Mac, the Happy Meal, McNuggets, and even the idea of the McDonalds playhouse. Another thing, the movie could had work on, is showing more, on how much, all of the founders were clean freaks. I felt that, parts of this was a bit lacking. After all, Kroc would often call, managers of his stores to clean their restaurant properly, until the day of his death in 1984. One thing that I didn't like, about the film is the love affair subplot. Don't get me wrong, Kroc did cheat on his wife, Ethel Fleming (Laura Dern) in real-life, but also in real-life, he didn't do it with Joan Smith (Linda Cardellini). Instead, he cheated Ethel with, his second wife, Jane Dobbin Green who sadly, isn't in the film, along with his real-life son that has the same name. In real life, it would take another eight years before Ray Kroc Sr. would end up marring Joan. Anyways, these parts weren't really needed, as Laura Dern seem a bit wasted in the role. Despite that, I like how Michael Keaton portray him. He was so charismatic. He manages to perfectly sell both Ray's optimistic beliefs and snakelike business decisions with a seemingly unending level of exuberance and persistence that not many other actors would be able to pull off. Like any great villain, he sees himself as the hero of his own story - one who believes that the rewards for his efforts have been long overdue. This film shows the good and bad side of American Capitalism. Because of this, I like how the film doesn't feel, like, just a generic happy go lucky commercial produce placement movie about its so called titular 'founder'. It really did show the complexity, while not undermining some of the strengths. However, the story structure was a bit too linear, and somewhat predictable. It was slow and clunky at parts, with a few large exposition dumps. Overall: The Founder had initially seemed like it was going to be a big end-of-the-year awards contender before the Weinstein Company suddenly moved it to a January release date. I still think, it should. It's worthy of a few awards. While, some of the language is salty, and there is a lot of beef between all three of the founders that could be cut out. I found the subject matter not too hard to chew. So, in the end, while it's unhealthy. It's decent. It's safe to say, at least, with this movie. It's not junk food.",The Founder

That's partially true, because this was inspired by the right kind of wrong thing. I mean it was not actually about the McDonalds' story, the McDonald brothers, but the fast food chain McDonald, how the franchise got rapidly spread across the globe and the person behind it. With the film having both good and bad side, it stayed mostly neutral. But due to the main character, you would see too much lean on what seems the reason behind the McDonald's today's popularity.So it's like another typical American founders' story like Apple, Facebook. I mean not the one who found the company with all the hard works, but the one who dived in and took all the credit. Ray Kroc was a traveling salesman and he's not doing any good. But one day he meets the brothers who had started a modernised kitchen and its fast food service. He shows lots of interest in it and so he joins hands with them. With his new ideas, how he makes a fortune out of it and the future of the company, all revealed in the later part.An enjoyable film. Particularly for Michael Keaton. Well directed film as well. Film wise it was a good one, but the story wise not morally right. It was about the flaws in our society, our system. Some men can do anything like pulling others leg to climb the success ladder. It's not them to blame completely, because they had struggled enough to understand their future path. So definitely for some people, this film would inspire. If you are a regular McDonalds' customer, you should watch it. Otherwise, just to learn the truth, it is worth a watch.7/10",The Founder
33,sol-,Fast Food Nation,7,4 December 2016,"Based on the true story of Ray Kroc, a traveling salesman who franchised the first family-owned McDonald's restaurant and turned it into the international conglomerate that it is today, 'The Founder' tells a fascinating slice of twentieth century history. The title is well chosen, hinting at the dynamic at the heart of the film with Kroc declaring himself the ""founder"" of McDonald's when in fact the idea of fast and efficient food service was never his to begin with - something that becomes a point of contention with the original owners. Michael Keaton is excellent in the lead role, exuding both charm and charisma while also always coming off as if he has something up his sleeve. There are several great shots throughout that linger on his face in close-up as he delivers persuasive sales pitches and there is a magnificent sequence late in the piece where several of his sermons in different locations are edited together to overlap as one big speech. Keaton also does well coming off as both victim and aggressor at varying points. At times, he comes across as an all-too-sympathetic underdog whose dreams are hindered by the McDonalds brothers' unwillingness to compromise in the name of progress. At other points, he seems insanely ruthless with how he circumvents everything in his way. Telling a similar slice of contemporary history, 'The Founder' is bound to be compared to 'The Social Network', to which it does not stack up as well, but it deserves to be considered as a film on its own. The storytelling approach here is more comedic than in the Facebook film and while 'The Founder' may have benefited from even more comedy to lighten the mood, it is an amusing film as it is - and a thought-provoking film when considers its basis in actual fact.",The Founder
34,Thanos_Alfie,The story of MacDonald's...,7,15 June 2021,"""The Founder"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch the way Roy Kroc, a salesman who turned McDonald's into the biggest restaurant business in the world. He had to be very ambitious and sometimes ruthless in order to succeed but nothing stopped him.I liked this movie because I did not know the story behind McDonald's and how it started. I also found very good and interesting the way it was presented from the start to one of the biggest restaurants in the world. The direction which was made by John Lee Hancock was good and he did an excellent job on the presentation of his main characters along with their own stories. The interpretation of Michael Keaton who played as Ray Kroc was simply outstanding and he made the difference. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were John Carroll Lynch's who played as Mac McDonald and Nick Offerman who played as Dick McDonald. All in all, I have to say that ""The Founder"" is a nice, interesting movie to watch and I highly recommend you to do so in order to learn more about the history of MacDonald's.",The Founder
35,zkonedog,The Rise Of An Empire,7,17 May 2017,"There are very few businesses that are recognizable the world over. McDonalds may be at the top of that list. ""The Founder"" is a film about how Ray Kroc created that empire.For a basic plot summary, ""The Founder"" beings with Kroc (Michael Keaton) struggling to sell milk shake machines. One day, however, he gets an order that brings him to meet Dick (Nick Offerman) & Mac (John Carroll Lynch) McDonald, owners of a revolutionary format of food- making (the ""Speedy"" system) that Kroc is utterly fascinated by. He immediately sees the opportunity for franchisement...but the McDonalds brothers are not fast movers. The rest of the film gives the back and forth between Kroc's more cutthroat, aggressive business model and the McDonald brothers' more conservative approach.The main reason that ""Founder"" succeeds as well as it does, I think, is because Keaton gives a great performance as Kroc. It is tough to make a film like this because the audience already knows how it all turns out (look at the McDonalds in seemingly every American town and it's obvious that Kroc's vision will trump that of the McDonald brothers). By giving Kroc traits that are both admirable and lecherous, however, Keaton creates depth of character that isn't necessarily built into the script.I don't see ""The Founder"" as a classic film, though, primarily because it is such a dry portrayal of the subject matter (save for some quality acting that does its best to rise above the words on the page). It's the type of movie where your expectations going in will equal your thoughts upon the final credits. It won't bore you (as it truly is a fascinating business story), but it won't necessarily completely engage you at all times either.I also wish that ""The Founder"" could/would have cut some of the exposition material in favor of advancing the story in today's times, where McDonalds has struggled mightily with health- conscious eaters and has seemingly lost much of the prestige the company once had. Those would have been very interesting topics to explore. However, the filmmakers and director John Lee Hancock clearly keep the focus on Kroc and the early portion of his building of the company.Overall, ""The Founder"" is a very well-made film, if not a spectacular one. It tells a story that probably deserves to be told, albeit in a very straightforward and thus often unspectacular manner. ""Workmanlike"" would be a good word to describe this film, as some solid acting and great visuals can't always cover up for the fact that the main story has built-in predictability and blandness issues.",The Founder
36,eddie_baggins,Keaton shines in this fascinating biopic,8,24 November 2016,"For many the thought nowadays of takeaway food is but a convenience we all enjoy (some more than others) but at one stage during human history the very idea of having your burger, fries and ice-cold Coke ready in mere seconds was a novelty that began sweeping the nation of America before taking over the world as we now know it today. A staple for over 60 years, McDonalds restaurants are a mainstay of everyday life, a reliable source of cheeseburger delicacies, crispy French fries and refreshing beverages that continue to supply the goods to those both young and those young at heart. When consuming McDonalds however, its unlikely many of us have ever truly considered where this establishment was born from and thankfully for all us, the story is a real doozy. It's often the case these days that high profile, well-marketed biopics are reliable as a Big Mac (you always know what you're going to get) but John Lee Hancock's film is imbedded with both an energy and pace that elevates it above the usual bio-fair and with another awards worthy turn from Michael Keaton as its centrepiece, this enthralling slice of history is a fabulously entertaining ride tinged in nostalgic 1950's vibes and garnished with a quick- smart script from The Wrestler screenwriter Robert D. Siegel. Capturing the time, place and allurement of this mankind changing business model, The Founder does a great job of transporting us back in time as we ride alongside struggling salesman Ray Kroc, whose eyes are opened when he comes across the McDonald brothers, whose business model of ""fast food"" finally gives Ray the chance his so longed for all his life, to make a buck and then some. Keaton's performance as Kroc is quite the feat. His a genuinely cold and calculated character but as the film begins we are happy to see him put in the hard yards as his franchise model of stores takes off but as the brand grows so does Kroc's ego and Keaton's performance morphs naturally as it does in fascinating and unexpected ways.Come the films later stages, the real feat of Keaton's turn comes into the spotlight and what we're left with is a layered character brought to life by the performer, whether it's in comical situations or brutally raw moments shared with lawyers, Keaton is on fire here and while his ably supported by the likes of Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch as the unfortunate McDonald brothers Dick and Mac, The Founder is founded off the back of Keaton's turn and whilst unlikely that this film will find itself in to many awards categories, Keaton is looming as a key player in the upcoming awards season.The Founder is one of those rare biopics that grabs you from the get-go and doesn't let up. A well shot, scored and acted studio film that tells a story worth telling (plus one of the best advertisements McDonald's has never paid for), The Founder offers a fascinating insight into the beginnings of the McDonald's brand that also gives us an equally fascinating real life figure and another chance for the career revival of Michael Keaton to continue on its merry way. 4 milkshake sachets out of 5",The Founder
37,leonblackwood,Great storyline which needed more detail! 7/10,7,1 September 2017,"Review: I quite enjoyed this movie, mainly because I didn't know anything about the history of McDonald's, and I found it interesting, how Ray Kroc took the McDonald brothers idea and made it into a billion dollar business. Michael Keaton, who plays Ray Kroc, starts out as a milk shake maker salesman, who tries his utmost to sell his idea but he doesn't get many sales. To his amazement, he gets an order for 8 of his machines, so he decides to see who wants them. After eating at the McDonald's restaurant, he has a chat with the brothers, who he is selling the machines to, and they give him a tour of there business, which changes Ray Kroc's life forever. He's amazed with the way that they run there fast food business, and he can see loads of potential of making it a worldwide business, so he listens to there back story and then he offers his services to franchise there company, for a little percentage. After building many McDonald's restaurants around America, he soon realises that the percentage that he agreed to, wasn't enough to live on, so he tries to renegotiate his original contract, which doesn't go down to well with the brothers. With loads of debt, his marriage in turmoil and the relationship with the Macdonald brothers going downhill, a lawyer gives him the idea to own the land of all the McDonald's, which means that the McDonald brothers would have to lease the land from him. After divorcing his long time wife Ethel (Laura Dern), he ends up in another dispute with the McDonald brothers about changing the way they make milk shakes, so Ray decided to take them to court, and finally ends up owning the billion dollar franchise. In my eyes, Michael Keaton is one of those actors that can't do anything wrong, so he was the perfect choice for this movie. The whole 50's look of the film, was also done quite well but it did feel like there was important information missing from the storyline. It seemed to jump from Ray being in debt, to Ray seeing the president, which was a shame because the rest of the movie was a decent watch. Anyway, I think that everyone would be surprised with how the worldwide, popular franchise started, and I can't help feeling sorry for the Macdonald brothers, who changed the whole fast food business forever but they never benefited from being in partnership with Kroc. Watchable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by John Lee Hancock, 60, who also directed The Rookie, The Alamo, The Blind Side and Saving Mr. Banks. He has certainly worked with some top actors, including Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock and Dennis Quaid, and he also wrote a Perfect World, directed by Clint Eastwood, and Snow White and the Huntsman, so he was a good choice to bring this unique story to the big screen. The way that the McDonald brothers came up with the ""speedy system"" on the tennis court, was a stroke of genius and I'm sure that type of system is still used today. I was hoping to see more of an in depth look into the McDonald's empire, especially when they went international but apart from that it's a part of history that needed to be told.Budget: $25million Worldwide Gross: $24millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/history/dramas, starring Michael Keaton, Nick Offerman, John Carroll Lynch, Linda Cardellini, Laura Dern, Patrick Wilson and B.J. Novak. 7/10",The Founder
38,TheMovieDiorama,The Founder showcases how greed lurks behind ambition.,8,25 February 2018,"I'm sure we've all eaten at a McDonald's before, the biggest fast food franchise on the globe. It wouldn't surprise me if we get a branch on the moon in the next few years. But do you really know the story behind the ""Golden Arches""? Businessman Ray Kroc was selling milkshake makers, when suddenly he is required to sell eight of them to a restaurant called McDonalds. Bewildered by the concept of a speedy food ordering system, Ray partners up with the original founders in an attempt to create a franchise. Forget about McDonalds, put aside the milkshakes, burgers and French fries, what we are presented with is a character study. An individual who is so blinded by ambition and perfection that he enables greed to take control of his mind. Businessmen typically have a mindset of just wanting to make money, and unfortunately Ray Kroc succumbs to the idealism of desiring success. He starts out with the best of intentions, but the rapid growth of the corporation moulds him into a sleazy unlikeable character. The contrast between him and the original founders was profound, where in the end you sympathise with them for what Ray did. Essentially stealing their business. Yet, would you have done the same? After all business is dog eat dog. Whether all of this is true or not, it's an interesting arc for the main character to take which does add much needed depth to a tired biopic formula. This is Michael Keaton's film, it's all about him. Luckily, he is a dependable actor and he continues his rejuvenated career with another captivating performance. He just gets better. Laura Dern added a subtle amount of emotion as Kroc's wife although I do wish she had more screen time. Her character could've been used far more to enhance the conflict of interest between the couple in their personal lives. Direction was good all round, loved the direct address at the start and end. Appreciated the continuity in regards to the McDonalds advertisements and merchandising. A highly interesting biopic!",The Founder

40,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Tells the McDonald's story in a fun, engaging manner",7,30 April 2017,"""The Founder"" tells the story of McDonald's Corporation founder Ray Kroc, the salesman and idea-chaser who turned two humble brothers' speedy burger concept into the biggest restaurant chain in the world. But Kroc isn't actually the most interesting part of his own movie.Kroc may be the focal point — and Michael Keaton the perfect fit — but the global familiarity of McDonald's makes the story of this ubiquitous and all-powerful company's humble beginnings the real captivating watch. Kroc's somewhat manipulative and ruthless takeover of the business and choice to cast its narrative in his favor is merely a supporting role and an interesting part of that story. A milkshake machine salesman in the Chicago suburbs, Kroc discovered Dick and Mac McDonald's (Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch) fast and efficient burger operation in San Bernardino, California. In the 1950s, burger joints were drive-ins that attracted a less desirable, loitering teenage crowd. So not only was McDonald's delivering the same or better quality food faster, but also its to-go system attracted families and working people. Kroc saw immediate potential and convinced the brothers to let him franchise out the restaurants back in the Midwest. Eventually, their partnership became two separate business entities, and the forward-thinking Kroc found that if he wanted to achieve greatness, he needed to squeeze them out.Robert Siegel's script presents this story in compelling, almost documentary-like fashion. Rarely is exposition so meaningful in a movie, let alone a vital piece of its entertainment value, and Siegel gets that. The narrative literally takes a break while we eat up the history of McDonald's. And a lot of what director John Lee Hancock (""The Blind Side,"" ""Saving Mr. Banks"") provides is visual exposition. One whole sequence early on is just the brothers telling Kroc their story. Cinematically basic, but a joy to watch.What ""The Founder"" lacks, however, is a willingness to tackle its story and main character's moral complexity. We sense and taste it as we watch this man, whose gumption we admire at the beginning, turn his back on the little guy, but the film doesn't access and confront these layers the way great dramas do. Instead, we're left feeling uncertain what to make of Kroc and how to feel when the dust settles.In general, both Siegel and Hancock struggle with subtext. What's happening on the surface of ""The Founder"" is so engaging and well-crafted, but moments that reveal character or deal with relationships between characters are either missing, inefficient or even heavy-handed. Scenes between Kroc and his wife, Ethel (Laura Dern), pop in and out to communicate the level of tension between them rather then presenting them in a way that we can burrow into their experiences and understand them. On the opposite end of that spectrum, when Joan Smith (Linda Cardellini) enters the picture as the alluring wife of one of Kroc's franchisees, she's playing piano and wearing a bright red dress to complement her bright gold hair. Picture that for a second. Yes, perhaps a little much.Yet there's a wholesomeness to ""The Founder"" that's not that far off to the wholesomeness and nostalgia of McDonald's back in the days before fast food became vilified by nutritional science and the scapegoat of upper-middle class frustrations with health and obesity. Anyone who was a child between the '50s and '90s probably has some fond memories of McDonald's, and the movie effectively taps into that. If you don't fall into that category, then you at least feel good about acquiring a more intimate understanding of the food service industry's biggest titan and the clever and pleasant ways ""The Founder"" depicts those facts and stories. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

41,paul-allaer,"""Contracts are like hearts, they are meant to be broken""",7,24 January 2017,"""The Founder"" (2016 release; 115 min.) brings the story of how Ray Kroc went into partnership with the McDonald brothers, and eventually ousted them from the business they started. As the movie opens, it is ""1954, St. Louis, MO"", and we see Kroc going door to soot trying to sell 5 spindle machines to make milkshakes, but with very little success. Then one day, out of the blue, an outfit in San Bernardino, CA called McDonald's. places an order for six such machines,""no, make that 8"" says Dick McDonald. Kroc can't believe his ears, and decides to drive across the country to check this place out. When he gets there, he cannot believe his eyes: quick service, and quality hamburgers. When Kroc asks the McDonald brothers why they haven't expanded across the country, Dick McDonald says: ""quality control"". It's not long before Kroc convinces the McDonald brothers to let him in on the action... At this point we're a good 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director John Lee Hancock (""The Blind Side"") and screenwriter Robert Siegel (""The Wrestler""--and not to be confused with the long time host of NPR's All Things Considered). Here they bring us a story that in spirit or concept is similar to ""The Social Network"", namely how the founder of what eventually would become an iconic company, gets pushed aside by a late comer (Mark Zuckerberg with Facebook, Ray Kroc with McDonald's). Let me tell you right now: ""The Founder"" ain't no ""The Social Network"", not even close. Whereas ""The Social Network"" is a riveting movie, ""The Founder"" at times feels like its strictly done by-the-numbers. Yes there are a couple of scenes that are memorable (midway in the movie, when it's becoming clear what is going on, Dick McDonald bemoans ""there is a wolf in the hen house, and we let him in""; towards the end, when it's an all-out war of words between the brothers and Kroc, the latter observes ""Contracts are like hearts, they are meant to be broken"", wow). but it's not enough to get me emotionally invested and wanting to care. The fact that Kroc turns out to be not all that sympathetic a person, doesn't help. Michael Keaton does the best he can with the material he's been given. Linda Cardellini as Kroc's love interest Joan does quite well too. Laura Dern plays Kroc's first wife. It's not like ""The Founder"" is an outright bad or poor movie, but to me the movie feels like a missed opportunity to bring us what should have been a riveting story. It just doesn't feel like it in ""The Founder"". (In the movie's closing photo montage, it reads that McDonald's feeds 1% of the world population every day... Can that really be true? I dunno.) The movie opened wide this past weekend, and did okay but not super well at the box office. The Tuesday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was also attended okay but not super well (understandable perhaps, it being a week night). The absence of any Oscar nominations (released today) will not help the movie obviously. I don't see this playing all that long in theaters, but maybe this is something you want to check out on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",The Founder
42,subxerogravity,Micheal Keaton is Ronald McDonald? Sounds great but the movie is a bit more intelligent than that.,8,21 January 2017,"Micheal Keaton is on a role since his career changing stint in Birdman. It's a worthy role for some sort of award season buzz (But I doubt that will happen since it was released in January) I only knew Micky D's as Satan's bar and grill, but at one point it was a wholesome Mom and Pop store (Or more accurate, Mom and Pop's two sons, the McDonald brothers, Rick and Mack). Until Ray Kroc came along and envisioned the American staple that the restaurant would become.As the Founder played by Micheal Keaton the movie mostly focus on Kroc's stake in it and how he successfully franchised it (Although the movie has this cool scene in which The McDonald brothers tell the story of how they came to start the 1st Fast Food chain through an amazing flashback).Micheal Keaton gets to play a role similar to characters such as Tony Soprano and Walter White, he starts out a struggling Milk shake machine salesmen whose ambition makes him hustle for more out of life. Then he meets the McDonald Brothers and struggles to franchise their invention, The Fast Food restaurant. You start to like him cause he's the underdog trying to keep the quality of the restaurant while extending the quantity of what is his franchise, and Keaton's performance makes you forget that this is the man who basically turn McDonald's into a massively powerful conglomerate and ambitious guys can't do that being nice as the movie proves.Just like with the Sopranos and Breaking Bad The Founder humanizes Ray Kroc, using Keaton's performance. He's a good guy, but when it comes to business he will not stop until his vision is met, and that's what makes this movie so good.Plus, it was interesting seeing the birth of McDonald's. Don't get me wrong, I act like I never had a Big Mac before (Which is never mentioned in the film so I guess it did not exist before 1970), but the story displays how someone could have a beautiful baby and then that innocent child would grow up to be Trump.Below the gut Jab, I know but the movie does a good job of examining the difference between those who have talent and those who have real focus and only the truly determine can make a name out of the golden arches, and that is The Founder.

43,jtindahouse,"Well made, but a touch forgettable",7,5 March 2017,"As a rule, I like to know as little about a film as possible before going into it. Unfortunately in the case of 'The Founder' that was not able to be the case. Firstly, I saw the trailer about a half a dozen times before other films leading up to its original release date. Then that date was pushed back at the last moment and I got to see it another half a dozen times before its second release date. By that stage I was thoroughly sick of the film, and I hadn't even seen it yet. Add to that the fact that it felt like the trailer was giving away practically the whole movie. I truly hate it when they do that. So I decided to skip seeing it in theatres and give myself some time before watching it. I finally got around to it tonight. Was it worth the wait? Meh, I suppose so. I wasn't wrong about that trailer telling you far too much. It's not a film that you could really spoil, but it still would have been nice to have some mystery surrounding the structuring of the story. I suppose you would describe 'The Founder' as a harmless film. it doesn't take any risks or stray far from convention, but it is well told. It's an interesting story (and obviously a true one), it's acted well and it's directed very tightly with good pacing. I can't help but wonder if there was a way they could've livened things up a bit though. Everything just feels a bit like it plays out exactly as expected.

Michael plays Ray Kroc, a milkshake mixer machine salesman in the early 1950's. He was not making a lot of sales but he was a persistent bugger. Then he hears about a diner in San Bernardino, California that is doing gang-buster business so he decides to check them out. He finds Nick and John, 2 brothers running an efficient hamburger diner and wants in on their success by franchising the business. Laura plays Michael's wife. It is an interesting story-if you are not familiar with it-about how Michael wheels and deals his way into making the global company that we know today. Sometimes, Michael is a sympathetic character and sometimes he is not-I mean he does make millions of dollars by franchising but he does steal credit from the 2 guys that came up with the ideas that have influenced almost every fast food restaurant since. You do learn the story about how McDonald's used to use real milk in their shakes and why they changed to a powered version and why they eventually changed back to the real milk version. It's rated ""PG-13"" for language and has a running time of 1 hour & 55 minutes.

We take for granted that they have always been there. But there was a time when these places were nothing like what we know today. Ask your grandparents and odds are they can tell you all about it. Or you could just watch THE FOUNDER and learn how they all came about with McDonald's as the centerpiece.Michael Keaton plays Ray Kroc. As the film opens Kroc is selling multi-head milkshake machines as a salesman. He travels across country with a machine in his trunk and goes to different restaurants and drive-ins (restaurant not theater style) to try and get them to purchase these. When he learns of a restaurant in San Bernardino that wants to buy 6 he calls to make sure they want that many only to learn they actually want 8. Curious, he drives across country to see why.What he finds is something he is amazed by. While most drive-in restaurants are local joints that kids hang out at, prone to getting your order wrong and taking up to 30 minutes to get that wrong order, this place is taking care of customers in the time it takes them to make change for your order. He tries the food, it's great and he eventually meets one of the owners, brother Mac McDonald (John Carroll Lynch). Mac tells him to finish eating and he'll show him how it works.From there we get the story of how the assembly line system put into place by the brother came to be with Dick McDonald (Nick Offerman) coming up with the concept. Kroc is amazed at the simplicity of it as well as how functional it is. The next day he returns to talk to the brothers with an idea in mind: franchise! But he's told they tried it once before and their concept of quality control was tossed out with each owner, all resorting to adding menu items, dirty kitchens and the same problems the standard drive-ins had.Ray eventually convinces them to let him try. He builds his first McDonald's franchise store and things go great. He's there to make sure it's done right and quality control remains intact. He then convinces several wealthy friends to do the same. But as with the first time this was attempted, they make changes. As with most things that happened to Kroc as seen in this film it was moments of chance that continued to alter things.Ray comes up with the idea of McDonald's owners as family. Rather than invite wealthy investors into opening stores he contacts couples, low income people with the dream of something better just like he had. The end result is it working. The franchises begin to sell and the company begins to grow. And that's where things begin to change once again.The goals of Ray Kroc and Dick & Mac McDonald were completely different. While they came up with the concept and were concerned with a quality product and system Kroc saw the potential for this to become the golden goose for his prosperity. He wants to include the brothers in this but they butt heads non-stop, never giving the okay to any changes he wants to made, their prerogative according to their contract with Ray. This eventually leads to a standoff between the two sides. Depending on your point of view either could be considered the good guy or the villain here.What makes this movie so enjoyable is just that, the ability to tell the stories of both the McDonald brothers and Ray Kroc as well as the history of McDonalds while not taking sides. Both have great ideas, both have something to offer but they also have issues that come into the mix that make things result in a terrible confrontation. Most know who won but the journey to discover that is entertaining and informative.The production values here are tremendous. The look and feel of the time is captured with flair and seeming ease. The photography helps to set the mood without taking center stage. And the performances are amazing from the three main leads, Keaton, Lynch and Offerman. The supporting cast also turn in fine performances as well.I watched this because I was curious to see what it was all about and I'm glad I did. The end result was a movie that never made me want to reach for the remote to fast forward. My guess is that most will enjoy this film as well.On a side note one thing I found funny among the miniscule extras here. At least one performer takes a shot at capitalism and discusses how this film shows the terrible things that come from it. I found it humorous to hear those words from someone with a net worth of $12 million. But then perhaps that's just me.",The Founder
49,AudioFileZ,He Was No Dave Thomas,6,4 February 2017,"As American business institutions go there are but a few juggernauts like Ford and McDonalds. It could be said to be the undisputed king within the restaurant business is harder than the automotive one simply due to a guy can brown bag a lunch but let him try to build a car.. That said when Ray Kroc visited the first McDonalds not even the true founding McDonald brothers could see a future past their front counter. Kroc did and he couldn't let it go. This was what he'd been missing and he had to have it. What followed were many ups with the only landmines being the obstinate McDonald brothers whose begrudged contract with Ray Kroc kept Kroc cash poor and under their thumbs. Kroc, who seemed like a homespun Mid-Westerner turned into a ruthless businessman in a kind of fight or flight survival scenario. As he morphed into a successful businessman, not just by his dogged persistence, but by a kind of providence of meeting key employees and franchisees at key times, Kroc turned a blind-eye to playing nice. In many respects he turned heartlessly dark. The Founder weaves the big picture of how the battle between the true founders and the man who called himself ""The Founder"" unfolded while McDonalds spread like an unbridled outbreak. Michael Keaton brings to life a wolf in sheep's clothing in this film. He leaves everything, including his wife, behind to pursue his vision. It's not flattering unless one subscribes to a kind of business model akin to selling one's soul. In this it succeeds and Keaton's Kroc is ultimately unlikable. Even so it's a story that fascinates in spite of the banality of being about hamburgers over the world. It's a kind of sad tale that few remember anything about Maurice and Richard McDonald who really were the birthers of the successful model of fast food. The brothers might have been stubborn, but they were light to Kroc's darkness. The final disdain a viewer walks away with by watching Keaton's Kroc is that he suckers the brothers into a handshake deal he never intends to keep even though he clearly says ""you've got my word"". There just might be a special fry basket for the Teflon Kroc after all?This movie isn't a celebration of a great American success story. It's a warts exposed interesting story of how ethics gets rewritten as business gets bigger. It's a good story for our times when huge banks, overblown government, and big business have squashed the American Dream by subversion of ethics. It will make you want to eat at home instead of grab a Big Mac and in that way this movie is a modest success while not being particularly entertaining. The Founder is about as good as the half-ass hamburger Kroc's chain conquered the world with which is to say ""good enough"".",The Founder

51,jadepietro,Kinda Lovin' It,8,3 February 2017,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5) GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: An engrossing film biography with a great performance by Michael Keaton in the lead role.SYNOPSIS: A biopic about McDonald's founder Ray Kroc's bumpy road to success. JIM'S REVIEW: The story of the billionaire businessman, Roy Kroc, and his underhanded dealings with The Brothers McDonald makes for an engrossing film about greed and the American Dream. Led by a wonderful performance by Michael Keaton in the ambitious and corrupt title role, The Founder shows the behind the scenes workings of this once small company with its giant ideas. Well, it was Kroc who has the million dollar vision and takes (eventually stealing) his inspiration from two local restaurateurs. These brothers, Ray and Mac McDonald, have a thriving business that Roy envies and sees on a more grandiose scale. He becomes their business partner and begins to build the well known franchise across the nation.The screenplay by Robert Siegel depicts this true story with conviction and style. Solidly directed by John Lee Hancock, the film is always compelling, although there are some serious omissions in both plot and character development. Except for the central role and the strong supporting characters in the McDonald clan, most of the other characters are underwritten. They are intriguingly introduced but suddenly disappear. These odd gaps affect the film's overall impact. It's as if some crucial scenes remain the cutting room floor and the movie-going audience must fill in the blanks. Some rewrites prior to filming would have made this film a much stronger offering. But it is the acting that truly registers. Foremost is Mr. Keaton. He brings many layers to his character's transformation from failing milk shake salesman to successful tycoon. At times, the actor talks directly to the audience in many close-ups with his glib quick- talking spiels and he rattles off his dialog with precision. We see how his ego and ambition destroy the man as he morphs into a corrupt and savvy entrepreneur. It is a brilliant performance that will be sadly overlooked by next award season due to the movie's early release.Bringing much gravitas and conflict to the plot are Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch, both excellent as the brothers. Their chemistry seems very real and they fill in any questionable lapses in writing by their nuanced portrayals. Laura Dern as Kroc's wife, Ethel, Linda Cardellini, Patrick Wilson, and B. J. Novak are underused but still make an impression in their sketchy roles.The Founder follows this fast food empire known as McDonalds and its origins. We watch the American Dream become a reality but also see its destructive and seductive power. Roy Kroc wanted it his way and got it all with mixed results. But it is Mr. Keaton who is the real burger king in this insightful biography.",The Founder

Michael Keaton gives a career best as Ray Kroc. A story of relentless persistence and determination.If you are curious about the beginnings of this great institution, 'The Founder' does a fine job of keeping you engaged throughout.

54,richard-1787,Star performance in well-made film,8,21 January 2017,"This is a generally well-made movie that never slows down, never gets boring.But what makes it so enjoyable is the performance by Michael Keaton as Ray Kroc. He could have exaggerated Kroc's already naturally exaggerated character and turned him into a buffoon, but he doesn't. He keeps Kroc human - though more and more despicable - and that is what holds you. His Kroc is a man driven to success - though we're not always sure of how he defines success for himself.The why of his character, the Rosebud, is not clear in this movie. The script is generally very good, but we never really learn why Kroc is willing to sacrifice his life and that of those around him to succeeding. Much is made of the real Ray Kroc's line about the wholesomeness of the MacDonald name, but from what we can judge, Kroc said that to the media as pr. What really drove Kroc remains a mystery.As the person I went with said to me at the end, she wasn't sure that she would ever want to eat in a MacDonald's again after seeing this movie, so hateful are Kroc's business practices.I strongly recommend this movie. Heaton's performance is remarkable, and the action holds you. You may not know what made Kroc tick after seeing it, but you will be fascinated by what he did while he was ticking.",The Founder
55,rannynm,The Man Who Turned McDonald's into one of World's Best Known Brands,8,30 January 2017,"The Founder is an entertaining, fascinating and interesting film that gives you a glimpse of the formation of one of the greatest and powerful food restaurant chain in America and worldwide - McDonald's. Throughout the film you experience the historical formation of this corporation and discover how a 50-year-old became the owner of a dominant corporation. As a viewer, I personally love the concept of the film and the rich iconic history of this massive food chain. Ray Kroc, a salesman, finds himself struggling selling milkshake machines for a couple bucks to support himself and his wife, Ethel Croc. As a salesman living in Illinois in the 1950s, Kroc has to face numerous rejections and several doors slamming in his face before he rises to become CEO of a grand corporation. On a drive across Route 66, Kroc comes across a family-friendly restaurant whose philosophy is ""30 seconds and not 30 minutes."" Amazed by this unique concept, Kroc will do whatever it takes to franchise and popularize this exclusive restaurant. American actor Michael Keaton delivers the perfect performance as Ray Kroc. Keaton's physical appearance and excellent acting skills bring us a perfectly believable ruthless, greedy, egotistical portrayal of Ray Kroc. Dick McDonald (Nick Offerman, Parks and Recreation) plays the McDonald brother who invented the idea of the ""speedy system"" and the iconic ""golden arches."" The supportive brother Mac McDonald is played by John Caroll Lynch, known for several film such as Shutter Island, Gran Torino and Zodiac. This review would be amiss without giving kudos to the film's amazing director, John Lee Hancock and its writer Robert D. Siegel. I really enjoyed watching this movie and watching the history of McDonald's unravel before my eyes. I like how the director and producers made this film so precisely accurate to the actual events that took place. The history of McDonald's is fascinating and intriguing. Minutes after the film, I was on my phone reading and learning more about its rich history. I learned that the director used exact locations, exact character names and exact details to produce this biographical drama exactly as he could. A clear and straightforward message is depicted throughout the 115 minutes of the film. A message of persistence and ambition can be seen through the actions of Mr. Kroc. He was a 50-year-old struggling business man who faced rejection after rejection, yet he does not give up or stop from archiving his dream. It's his persistence, hunger to succeed and ambition that lead him to achieve his goal. There is something we can all learn form Kroc, since we all have personal dreams and goals.As a history lover myself, I recommend this film to any history enthusiast who is interested in learning about the formation of McDonald's. I also recommend this film to ages 15 to 18 and believe adults will enjoy this too. I give this biographical drama four out of five stars. It is playing in theaters now so, go check it out.Reviewed by Maria G., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.",The Founder
56,Kingslaay,Criminally Underrated,9,29 April 2017,"The Founder is the best film I have seen in 2016. It tells the story of Ray Kroc and the foundation of the McDonald's franchise. The direction, narration and pace of this film is close to perfect. The beauty and ease with which this film is told is effortless. The start of it includes an interesting monologue from Michael Keaton to the audience and towards the end after the events of the story we see the monologue again as the film comes full circle. The acting is first class with Michael Keaton giving one of his finest performances. There is never a dull moment and you are captivated from start to finish. Who knew McDonald's had such a rich and interesting history. We see the gradual rise of a salesman and a restaurant into something that is ubiquitous in today's times. His rise is littered with so many interesting challenges and dilemmas, personally and professionally. Professionally he faces issues from the owners of the very first restaurant who hinder his expansion plans. Personally we see his marriage suffer because of his ambition. The revelation of being in the land business and change in business strategy was beautifully done. The film had some great moments littered throughout it like the first time Keaton orders his fast food and is surprised to immediately receive it. Or his great confrontation in the men's room towards the end about being the real owner of the restaurant. The Founder was also notable about showing the dark side of business, never have verbal agreements or handshakes but a contract. When there is an empire to be had one must not rely only on someone's word.The credit in many parts belongs to Michael Keaton who delivers a stellar performance. Others also give notable performances in the film. The pace and intensity of The Founder never stops. You are immersed in Ray Kroc's/Keatons story and journey. I am beyond astonished by its rating of just 7.2. I felt this film narrowly beat War Dogs to become the best film of the year. It deserves a strong spot on the top 250 films of all time.

57,bkrauser-81-311064,McDonalds Gets the Hollywood Treatment,7,31 January 2017,"Hollywood has always had a complicated relationship with biographies based on entrepreneurs. On the one hand, film as an industry adores innovation; both in front of, and behind the screen. Sure the industry has a propensity to navel-gaze, has a somewhat dysfunctional, insular and dare I say incestuous relationship with itself, its resources, its talent and (cough, cough) it's accounting standards. Yet aside from some notable exceptions, the message we hear all the time coming out of Hollywood is: no matter who you are if you got talent, persistence and a bit of an ego, you can succeed in La La Land.Yet whenever Hollywood points its magnifying glass elsewhere, at other industries, at other innovators, it becomes less about the innovation and more about corruption, avarice and ruination. If one were to draw a line through the skin-deep themes of The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), The Social Network (2010) and Steve Jobs (2015), you'd have an outline that says ""GREED IS BAD"" in big bold letters.The Founder tries to be a different kind beast. It tries to have its Big Mac and eat it too which is saying something, considering the one thing you can say about Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg as at least they're not as craven as Ray Kroc. The film begins with Kroc (Keaton), desperately trying to unload milkshake machines into the laps of unwilling restaurateurs. His pitch is rehearsed, enthusiastic but slimy to the core; ""are you familiar with the concept of the chicken and the egg,"" he starts. Most don't let him finish. He's the type of traveling salesman ""Cat's in the Cradle"" by Harry Chapin was probably dedicated to.One day, while checking his messages, Kroc comes across an unusually large milkshake machine order from a San Bernadino burger joint called McDonalds. Curious, Kroc stops by McDonalds; a journey that takes him through a Midwest full of mediocre drive-ins with slovenly food and long wait times. Then he gets his taste of his first McDonalds hamburger in 30 seconds flat sitting on a park bench. His response to the owners Dick (Offerman) and Mac (Lynch) McDonalds, ""franchise, franchise, franchise."" Yes it's true Kroc never came up with the McDonald's brand; he never came up with the concept of fast food, the automation system in which that food is prepared, the company's fidelity to the all-American hamburger or, heck, even the name. Yet the movie portrays his embrace and rapid expansion of those ideas as an innovation in itself. He covets the McDonalds name as if it was a painting and he the artist. Every cent of capital, Kroc uses to build franchises nationwide. He even uses his home as collateral. Truly, he's the quintessential obsessive rogue we've all come to learn to admire.He all but convinces us, the audience that he is deserving of the title ""Founder"". Yet the movie stops just short of being a working-class screed on the magic of capitalism. For one, the temperament of the McDonald's brothers and their ""parade of no's,"" clings to the usual humdrum highlights we've seen done better in other films. Yet their impression on the film looms so large that most audiences will presumably walk away with the same ""GREED IS BAD"" message the film is trying to sidestep. They're the small guys, they're the ones who believe in quality control, they're the ones who keep high ethical standards - thus you best believe they're also going to get squelched by the time the film is over.As the swindle is a matter of public record, its hard to fault a movie for being, you know, true. And had the movie leaned into an anti-avarice message, it may have approached the quality of a bonafide Oscar contender. But it didn't - and instead draws a picture of Ray Kroc that glinted with a Hollywood sheen rather than harsh lighting. Considering the subject, I would have rather the movie cooked him over a hot grill.",The Founder

The sheer propulsiveness of his own personal 'comeback' narrative adds extra and much needed texture to the movie, which simply would not have been there, had someone else been cast. It feels like he's spent his fair share of time hustling and scrabbling around in the wilderness, dreaming of something bigger... and the intensity of that really comes through, in his performance.Also, one thing related to the movie: Why would the McDonald brothers willingly shake hands with the devil, when he's explicitly TOLD them he's going to screw them over?!

59,Screen_Blitz,Michael Keaton shines in this satisfying account of the man who brought birth of biggest running food company on the globe,8,14 August 2017,"What does director John Lee Hancock, the man who helmed the football biopic 'The Blind Side' and the Walt Disney biopic 'Saving Mr. Banks', has to offer in the history of the rising fast-food chain we all know as McDonald's? This satisfying and intriguing biopic is a fascinating examination of the little-known history behind one of the largest companies in the world. What transpires in this near two-hour runtime is a character study of the man who crossed paths with the burger joint and transformed from your less-than-average fast-food network into a major franchise that spawned to over 100 countries across the globe. And Michael Keaton is the man in the suit, a man who faced many challenges while testing ethical boundaries that made him both a fascinating and somewhat unlikable guy. Collaborating with Hancock is writer Robert D. Siegal who serves as the screenplay wizard and illustrates a potent, if not masterful account on the man that changed the food industry forever. Opening up in 1954, the film follows the story of Ray Kroc (played by Michael Keaton) who went on an unsuccessful trek across the country, trying to sell his innovative milkshake machine to various food joints. He eventually came face-to-face with hope when he found a burger joint named McDonald's in San Bernardino run by brothers Dick (played by Nick Offerman) and Mac (played by John Carroll Lynch). Impressed by their unprecedented service, Kroc made a deal with the brothers who reluctantly agreed to turn the restaurant into a nationwide (eventually worldwide) franchise. But as the rising fast-food company was reaching many heights of success, Kroc found his relationship with the brothers tested as he began to dive into some questionable business practices that eventually led him to success while the brothers, who are tried to play things simple, were being pushed on the sidelines. Whether you crave the taste of McDonald's burgers or not, it is hard not to become fascinated in John Lee Hancock's compelling examination into a man who spat his face of business ethics to make his landmark achievement in bringing the once-local restaurant into a worldwide sensation. And when it comes to feeding audiences with intriguing information about the birth of the fast-food joint, this movie never takes that opportunity for granted. One of the biggest accomplishes that the film perpetrates is by not going too to lionize nor demonize Ray Kroc for his methodology to success but by simply painting an intelligent picture of his actions that took place during the inception of the fast-food joint into the major corporation. Michael Keaton plays Kroc, the man who set out to make a difference but did so breaking the boundaries and eventually lead to the initial founders of the company to flunk out of the business they originally built. As disconcerting as the story is, it is difficult not to admire the performance Michael Keaton displays, powerfully portraying the man who had the brains and persistence to strive for success but lacked the heart and soul that diminished the relationship with the McDonald brothers and his wife, played fantastically by Laura Dern, whom he neglected in the process. He is a man who you will be rooting for one moment, then a few moments later finding yourself conflicted by it due to his selfishness, especially when considering the fact that he also robbed one of the investors of his wife, played by Linda Cardellini. It is a triumphant tale, but with an unfair silver lining underneath the surface. The Founder is a provocative biopic sparkling with an astonishing performance by Michael Keaton and a strongly fascinating character study that injects powerful interest in the widely unknown history of the fast-food company many know and love to this day, despite the checkered history. Although it may not fit too well in the Oscar category, it certainly warrants for an important, if not superb experience.",The Founder

61,classicalsteve,The Story of a Washed-Up Milkshake Machine Salesman Created an Empire,8,7 May 2017,"France is known for its art museums and literature. England for its poetry and novels. Germany for its music. What about the United States? Fast food franchises! ""The Founder"" chronicles the creation of the McDonald's fast food franchise which changed the world in terms of fast-food production. At the center of the story is Ray Kroc who did not invent McDonald's, and he certainly did not invent the concept of fast-food. The brilliance of the film is an on-going question: who is ""the founder""? The McDonald's brothers created the original McDonald's restaurant in San Bernardino, CA in 1940. Ray Kroc didn't come into the picture until over 10 years later.Michael Keaton in one of his most convincing performances plays Ray Kroc, a down-on-his-luck seller of milkshake mixers. In the Post-Second-World-War Era, the United States' culture was shifting. Young people were beginning to influence the culture with slick cars, pop music, and fast food. Most drive-up fast food places employed girls in miniskirts roller-skating to customers waiting in their cars with mixed results (no pun intended). The casual diner seems to have a new competitor in drive-up restaurants. A tray was secured on the outside of the window and the customer would receive their meal while in their car.Kroc is trying to sell to different fast food restaurants his milkshake mixer which would speed up significantly the time to make milkshakes. These places seem to need his innovative product, but he has little success. He's been pedaling from restaurant-to-restaurant in the Midwest when he learns that a little fast-food restaurant in San Bernardino, California, has ordered 8 of his mixers. The restaurant, called ""McDonalds"" is about 2000 miles away from his residence in Illinois. Intrigued, Kroc takes a trip to see the restaurant.In San Bernardino he learns that a couple of brothers who lived through the Depression of the 1930's came up with an ingenious way to deliver meals: an assembly line. At their McDonald's, people walk up to a window instead of being served by a doll on skates, which is certainly much less sexy but more efficient. Kroc orders the typical lunch: burger, fries and a milkshake and receives his order in less than a minute. Happy customers receive their orders quickly, and more orders can be fulfilled in less time. Kroc meets the brothers who tell their story.Kroc realizes that there's an opportunity to expand the idea, duplicating restaurants all over the United States, which is I think Kroc's true innovation. The McDonald brothers lament that they tried with mixed results to expand, but managers in different locales had their own way of doing things. Kroc decides he needs to replicate the idea exactly. He then signs a contract with the brothers allowing him to entice other entrepreneur-investors to open up franchises. He signs businessmen with deeper pockets to open up franchises, but there's a problem. Despite that he convinces businessmen like himself to open up McDonalds restaurants, Kroc is receiving very little revenue for his efforts, and all the while the McDonald brothers are busy with their own restaurant in San Bernardino.After a confrontation with the bank which initially gave him the loan with which he is close to defaulting on, he meets Harry J. Sonneborn. Sonneborn explains why Kroc is not making nearly as much money as he could be. He explains to Kroc he shouldn't be in the fast-food business, but be in the real estate business. And this becomes the final piece in the puzzle to create the McDonald's empire.A thoroughly enjoyable film, certainly not a masterpiece of filmmaking in the same way that McDonald's hamburgers are not exactly gourmet. The brilliance of the film is its understatement without becoming too maudlin or idealistic. The point of the Founder is that while Kroc didn't innovate the idea of an assembly-line food outlet, Kroc figured out how to take the idea and make it global. The only piece missing from the story concerns the french fries. Apparently, on that fateful day when Kroc visited McDonalds in San Bernardino, he asked why so many people were at the restaurant. Burgers good? They're okay. What about the shakes? Pretty good. Well, then what? The French fries were the best they'd ever had!",The Founder

One of the world's greatest swindles was how an average schmuck was able to discover an ingenious fast food restaurant and pull the rug out from under the humble owners. McDonald's is a global fast food empire, but not in the ways that you might have thought it was. The Founder is truth to power, and it's a great film. Ray Kroc, portrayed here by Michael Keaton is as toxic to look at and listen to as eating a single McFlurry. He is slimy, gross and crooked, but that's what makes The Founder so intoxicating to watch. Ironically enough, this film about a businessman taking advantage of others was brought to the silver screen by Harvey Weinstein. I know art can at times imitate life, but this is ridiculous. I guess Weinstein, in that sense, is a kindred spirit to Kroc. Nice guys sadly finish last.",The Founder
65,rockman182,The Founder (2017),7,5 February 2017,"This film is not really what you expect it to be. Upon first glance at the trailer you would think its the story of the founder of McDonalds who comes from nothing and works hard to start a global fast food chain. That's really not what this was about. I would say this film is quite unique; I never expected the roots of a popular fast food chain to get a film. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued to see the film though. Overall, I'd say its a mixed bag with a stronger first section than second.Michael Keaton plays Ray Kroc, a down out of luck milk shake mixer salesman, who one day stumbles upon a restaurant owned by the McDonald brothers. This restaurant innovative service where orders are made in 30 seconds or less, through the technical setup of equipment, staff, and assembly line-like practices. Kroc becomes enamored with the idea of fast food chains and eventually sets into motion multiple stores around the country, much to the brothers behest. Kroc is not a lovable guy at all, if anything he is an extremely selfish, self-motivated snake who betrays his partners and family. Keaton is perfectly fine in this yet again continuing his acting resurgence.There is betrayal and greed at every turn, thus the films marketing doesn't prepare you for the type of greedy character seen in Kroc. It is what it is and this is probably how many business men get ahead in life. It was interesting to hear the McDonald brothers story and seeing just how the first store started up. As stated earlier, the film starts off very engaging but goes through lapses of being uninteresting despite being in an unfamiliar place from a storytelling perspective.I wasn't sure if this was going to be one of the Oscar season pictures but after seeing it I can see why it isn't because it becomes too generic and doesn't really offer much worth talking about besides a story that may be shocking to people. I'm not really sure if its a film we needed but at the very least you may be interested to see the history of probably the most recognizable fast food chain in the world.

66,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A cookie-cutter corporate success story with all its ugly edges.,7,5 August 2019,"I hate to admit it, but many of these biopics about successful individuals all come off as the same story. Some down-on-his-luck guy stumbles across an idea that he steals (or has stolen from him) and makes his own to enormous success, betraying his friends and family along the way. We saw it in The Social Network (2010), Jobs (2013), Joy (2015), and The Greatest Showman (2017). The Founder (2016) is just another in this almost cookie-cutter genre that covers the origins of the McDonald corporation we know today.That's not to say that The Founder isn't entertaining. As an engineer, I was fascinated at how the McDonald brothers were able to be successful by creating efficiencies and eliminating waste in the process of selling hamburgers and other fast food. The trick is that the titular character, Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton), is half protagonist (the one you want to root for) and half antagonist (the one you realize is a complete slimeball). I'm all for celebrating enormous success. However, these films often paint the picture with the subtitle of, ""but at what cost?""Perhaps that's the moral of the story for these films: complete power corrupts completely. You don't truly know the mettle of a man until he claws and scrapes and moves all the way up the ladder of success. Money changes people. Success changes people. There's certainly an aspect of ego that factors in here, with humility vanishing away as the individual starts to realize that people are beginning to seek him out, instead of the other way around. In the case of The Founder, there's pretty much straight-up theft of intellectual and marital property that puts a sour taste in my mouth like a milkshake that isn't made with milk.A cookie-cutter corporate success story with all its ugly edges, I give The Founder 3.5 stars out of 5.",The Founder
67,RforFilm,The Founder is the McDonalds version of There Will Be Blood...and I'm lovin it,9,13 February 2017,"When somebody like myself can describe their childhood as always remembering the golden arches from the McDonalds, I don't know whether to describe this memory as sad, like an imprinted advertisement, or simply American. Regardless of the opinion of their food, McDonalds is the standing example of the American dream, both for the consumer and the businesspeople. For a typical family, they have the option of forgoing the hard work of cooking in favor of having hamburgers in a short time (I never said it's a good thing, just an option). For the entrepreneur, McDonalds is more then just a restaurant; it's a success story of an American company that has gone global. McDonalds today represents American capitalism; always expanding, always trying to please the customer, and always ruthless. For a company that has prided itself off of its food, they've been criticized for the health factor and their aggressive marketing tactics. A lot of a companies behavior goes back to the ones the started it. It may be the case for a lot of companies like Apple, Starbucks, Wal Mart, and Playboy, but McDonalds actually had two beginnings. Their stories are shown in The Founder. Milkshake maker salesman Ray Kroc (played by Michael Keaton) seems to be doing well at his job, but is striving for something bigger. His usual sales to restaurants and drive-ins give him a glimpse at the flaws of these places including wrong food orders, long waits, and loud atmosphere full of teens. When an order for eight mixers is placed by a restaurant in San Bernardino, Kroc drives out there to see this ""McDonalds"". What he encounters is a revolutionary speed system that allows food to ready fast along with disposable paper and a family friendly environment. Kroc meets the McDonalds brothers, Dick (played by Nick Offerman) and Mac (played by John Carroll Lynch) who convinces them to let him help franchise the restaurant. Kroc at first has a hard time convincing investors to join in on this new restaurant idea, and the few wealthy ones that do try to do things their own way (including fried chicken on the menu!). Once he gets the idea that middle class investors are more likely to follow the McDonalds standards, restaurants start to explode across the Midwest and the business takes off like crazy. As Kroc gains power, he starts to become more defiant against the McDonalds brothers, despite being restricted by their original contract.My original fear was that The Founder was simply going to be a commercial for McDonalds. What I got instead was a very fascinating character study into the mind of Ray Kroc. A bad screenplay could have easily made Ray Kroc a pioneer or a monster, but this somehow balances out everything in a fair viewpoint. You don't agree with a lot of the tactics Kroc does to make the burger business boom, but the movie shows where he's coming from. They also portray him as vulnerable, as they show later that one of the companies biggest tactics comes from a third party.Michael Keaton is perfect as Ray Kroc. He balances the scripts tough job of making him tough and backstabbing, yet likable enough that you still want to follow him.I have to give a lot of credit to both Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch as the McDonalds brothers who have the caliber to pull off the perfectionist, yet naïve attitude that the original siblings had. The Founder is neither a pro or anti McDonalds movie. This is more like Patton or Nightcrawler; it's a study on a person in which your supposed to make your own judgment on. I'll give this nine McDonalds logos out of ten. Had I seen this last year, it probably would've ended up on the best of 2016. The good news is that even without the accolades it missed out on, The Founder is still a good movie from start to finish. Check it out and see if your lovin it like I am.",The Founder
68,cultfilmfan,The Founder,10,21 January 2017,"Who knew the story behind how McDonald's Restaurant became a worldwide phenomenon and franchise and the man behind it would be such a fascinating and engrossing film? I also find it interesting to point out that just this week as The Founder was given a wide theatrical release, earlier this week it was revealed on the news that the current McDonald's Restaurants, and I would assume that this would be not just the restaurants here in Canada, but most likely nationwide, it was revealed that most if not all of the food cooked there had come into contact with some sort of peanuts, or nuts which would prove to be a problem for anyone with any kind of serious allergy and I know this could potentially pose not only health risks to the customers, but also perhaps turn away those same customers as nut and peanut allergies in particular seem to be on the rise and those who are very allergic to it need to keep away from it at all costs. Just an interesting side note here as with this new film we are introduced into how McDonald's came to be and why in pretty much every city you will most likely find one. The film profiles the founder (if that is the right word to use) Ray Kroc, who was initially more of a salesman who embarked upon a small San Bernardino restaurant in California, run by two brothers who really seemed to be changing things in the fast food market. Keep in mind that this was back in the 50's and in an era when drive through meals were extremely popular and a big thing at that time. When, I say drive through, perhaps I should say ""drive in"" because this is where a cute girl in roller skates would come up to your parked car outside of the restaurant and would take your order and what was supposed to be a short amount of time, you would then get that meal delivered to your car by the same girl wearing the same pair of skates and you could then eat the meal in your car with utensils and other things provided. Not surprisingly that idea did not prove to be too novel and that is why when Kroc discovers this new restaurant in California, run by these two brothers, he discovers that they have an operation that not only runs smoothly, but also delivers great results. Forget the waiting in your car for the food as well as the girls in roller skates, but now you could go up to the restaurant window and place the order yourself and receive everything that you asked for in most times in less than a minute's time. Extremely impressive, isn't it? And so sparked the curiosity of Kroc, who didn't just want to invest in this restaurant, but turn it into a national franchise with new locations popping up everywhere. As the film goes along we really get to see the true kind of man that Ray Kroc is, or should I say was. He was a man who was more than anything else an opportunist. The two brothers with the original one location restaurant were big on quality, great customer service and everything meeting very strict standards and what they thought of to be the absolute best. Kroc, on the other hand was more interested in the cash he would receive from these restaurants and whether it lead to cutting costs when it came to quality, or being ruthless enough to cut people literally out of deals and leave them high and dry, he would stop at nothing to make more money for himself and what he considered to be his precious investment, when in reality everything about what Ray did was stolen, or copied from these two original brothers who had good ethics and values regarding business and Kroc milked them and the business for all that it was worth for the sake of profit. I don't have to tell anyone how this story ends because wherever you are living you probably have your own golden arched restaurant nearby flashing that famous name. This is another in a line of great films not just about seeking opportunity and finding a name for yourself in the business world, but it again addresses the absolute greed and corruption that can come from it. Was Kroc really a genius in the marketing world, or did he have the right people with him and knew how to bleed something till it was absolutely dry? This is a film that is tremendously entertaining and the fact that it is all true makes it even more so. The film will disgust you at times with it's look at greed and corruption in your fellow man, but at the same time it will leave you with a good look at society and what has happened to it. The script is intriguing and well written as is the spot on direction, and who could forget the marvellous performance by Michael Keaton as Ray Kroc? He deserves an Oscar for it and I am so glad that he has his career back on track again. A film with much to say and think about which is just as tasty as even the food which it may represent. One of the year's absolute best films.",The Founder

72,dave-mcclain,"""The Founder"" is interesting and solid, but unspectacular when compared to similar films like ""The Social Network"".",7,23 January 2017,"The 2010 biopic ""The Social Network"" won three Oscars and was nominated for another five (including Best Picture) for its depiction of the feud between Harvard students Cameron and Tyler Winkelvoss and Mark Zuckerberg, whom the Winklevoss twins accused of using their ideas for his social networking website which became Facebook. Some people may remember the name Winkelvoss but how many remember the names Cameron and Tyler? Many more people know the name Mark Zuckerberg – or at least Facebook, the name of Zuckerberg's version of the social media website which changed the world.The 2016 biopic ""The Founder"" (PG-13, 1:55) tells a similar story from the mid-1950s, when an entrepreneur named Ray Kroc used the ideas of Richard and Maurice McDonald to create the first global fast food empire. You may not know the names Richard and Maurice (or even Ray Kroc), but you definitely know the name ""McDonald's"". According to Wikipedia, ""McDonald's restaurants are found in 118 countries and territories around the world and serve 68 million customers each day. McDonald's operates 36,615 restaurants worldwide, employing more than 420,000 people."" Here's how it all began: Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) is a middle-aged traveling milkshake machine salesman. He has done alright for himself and his wife, Ethel (Laura Dern), who struggles to support him through his many money-making ventures and frequent absences from home as he pursues further success (which he admits to Ethel will probably never be enough for him). When his current job brings him to San Bernardino, California and into contact with Maurice (""Mac"") and Richard (""Dick"") McDonald, Ray is fascinating by their innovative fast food restaurant with its fast service, good food & family atmosphere. Ray wants in.Mac and Dick show Ray their operation, tell him their story (the little-known history of how they came to create McDonald's) and Ray convinces them to let him rejuvenate their moderately successful but frustrating attempts to franchise their operation. They make Ray sign a detailed contract which specifies consistent standards for all McDonald's restaurants and gives the three of them less than 2% of the profits from future franchises. Ray opens his first McDonald's franchise in Des Plaines, Illinois (near his home) and proceeds to franchise as fast as he can, starting in the Midwest, using his home as collateral.It's not long before Ray wants to make changes that the brothers veto. Ray wants to gain additional revenue by entering into an agreement with Coca-Cola for them to display their logo inside all McDonald's. The brothers say ""no"". Ray wants to get rid of expensive freezers storing ice cream and use a new powdered milk shake. The brothers say ""no"". Ray, frustrated by his meager share of the profits from all his franchises, wants to renegotiate his contract. The brothers you know. Then, Ray meets a financial consultant (B. J. Novak), who shows him how to gain greater control over the franchises.Mac and Dick McDonald are portrayed as both thinkers and doers who just want to make an honest buck for honest work, while Ray Kroc is shown to be a dreamer who wants to make a fortune and doesn't mind scheming to do it. He thinks bigger than the McDonald brothers, but he works equally hard. Ray is able to succeed at franchising where they failed – enforcing Mac and Dick's high standards across the chain – but wants more expansion than they're interested in. Ray also wants more out of his personal life, especially after he meets Joan Smith (Linda Cardellini), wife of one of his franchisees.""The Founder"" is solid but unspectacular. The script, by Robert D. Siegel (""The Wrestler"", ""Big Fan"", ""Turbo""), keeps things interesting, the direction, by John Lee Hancock (""The Blind Side"", ""Saving Mr. Banks"", ""Snow White and the Huntsman"") keeps things moving at a good pace and the all-star cast keeps us engaged. It lacks the pizazz of ""The Social Network"" (and ""There Will Be Blood"", both of which were influences for the filmmakers), but ""The Founder"" remains a fascinating and entertaining look behind the scenes at one of the greatest untold stories of 20th century American business. Even without the Oscars it was seeking, it's well worth a look. ""B+""",The Founder
73,swilliky,The amazing story of ruthless persistence,7,22 January 2017,"The background story of how McDonald's came to be on every street, delivering fast service is the story of Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) and his persistence. Keaton is great as the struggling businessman trying to sell milkshake machines to restauranteurs. When he hears of a large order, he visits the restaurant run by the two McDonald brothers, Dick (Nick Offerman) and Mac (John Carroll Lynch). Kroc immediately sees that this formula could be highly and works to convince the brothers to create a franchise.I found the story behind the brother trials and tribulations incredibly interesting and was fascinated with their outline of the restaurant and their constant working of the routine to arrange the restaurant so they could deliver services fast.

This film as a whole is constructed very well stemming from well crafted script(that does more than just check off boxes like many biopics)though some of the editing I feel isn't quite in sync with the visionary intentions.

77,DarthVoorhees,A contradictory American fable that cannot fully define it's titular 'Founder',6,13 May 2017,"'The Founder' tries it's hardest to be subversive. It really wants to be bold in dissecting Americana and McDonald's. The problem is that McDonald's has seeped so far into the American consciousness that 'The Founder' seeps into fear because it cannot take that extra step. 'The Founder' doesn't know if it wants to demonize Kroc or celebrate him and it is the film's achilles heal. Kroc as written is kind of all over the place. The truth is the one thing Kroc was exceptional at was being a predatory capitalist. The movie understands this to some degree and these are the best moments of the film. 'The Founder' acknowledges Kroc's faults but it really badly wants to still celebrate the whole myth of a failing milk shake machine salesman pulling himself up by his bootstraps and making good. You can't have your cake and eat it too here.'The Founder' is saved by it's performances. Michael Keaton is exceptional and tries his hardest with this uneven script. In essence he is playing two characters, Kroc the dreamer who says the Golden Arches will be a staple in every town's sky across the country. Keaton does good here and for a while brings out the charm in such a character. The problem is such material is uninteresting because it's become as cliché and mundane as a Big Mac. The more interesting piece of the performance is Keaton as the sleazy manipulative Kroc. It's a part that perfectly fits his sense of humor and irony. The best moment of the film comes across when Kroc explains that he wanted the atmosphere of McDonalds more so than the actual hamburger preparation process. He delivers the material in such a way that we see that this character has been two- faced literally the entire film. It's a brilliant scene and it makes me wish the entire movie had been from this vantage point but it can't because we need to see Kroc deliver schmaltzy Capra corn speeches before he twists the knife in the McDonald brothers.Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch are brilliant but they too don't have much to work with until the final act. When we meet the McDonald brothers they are doughy bright eyed business men. They essentially become puppies we get to see kicked over and over again. That being said I like the evolution of the characters. The movie it's self would have been more interesting if it were told from their point of view instead of Kroc's. Their story is more interesting and more relevant to the McDonald's myth. You expect an aw shucks attitude when the McDonald's business slips through their hands but the characters develop a cynicism. It's sad when they realize that their entrepreneurial spirit won't be enough to save them. Offerman and Lynch both have a warmth but when they turn angry and depressed it gets to you. 'The Founder' is a mixed bag. Like 'Saving Mr. Banks' and it's Disney exploration I think American pop culture doesn't have the courage to fully condemn McDonald's. A half condemnation like this isn't effective for the story being told. The Keaton fan will enjoy some moments of fine acting. The sad fact is that this really is just a rags to riches bio pic with unfulfilled promises of dissecting deeper material. I suppose you should just be glad the film didn't go to the other extreme and canonize Kroc.",The Founder

He believes this is a mistake so checks the order and travels across America to visit the McDonalds brothers, while there he is offered a tour of the kitchen. There it takes 30 seconds to assemble a completely uniform burger, Ray realises the carefully choreographed kitchen efficiency is so amazing that he wants to franchise this revolutionary idea and puts himself in charge of this.At first you really want Ray to succeed but soon learn that his devious, cut-throat methods make him an unlikable character. He is completely driven by greed, and it's obvious that he cares about no one but himself. The brothers' draw up a contract with Ray and here we start to sense that there will be many business conflicts to come.Later in the film Ray meets a lawyer who convinces him to buy the land the restaurants were built on, Ray soon realises that he was no longer in the food business but in the real estate business and the film takes a darker turn.There are more conflicts, heated arguments and slamming of phones. The brothers become increasingly worried about their new partner. One quote that demonstrate this  ""There's a wolf in the hen-house and we let him in"". Ray certainly takes the idea and makes the ""McDonald's"" name into a global corporate phenomenon but his methods were extremely ugly.The film makes you question whether the McDonald's brothers (who just wanted to preserve their integrity), were actually a burden on their company, or was Ray a commercial genius who was overly greedy with questionable business ethics?

I wanted to see this movie only because I wanted to understand the pattern of deceit, cheat and stealing, of the new American dream - of humanity at this lowest ebb.I loved Social Network not for the reasons everyone loves it - because Mark is one of the richest man in the world today. He cheated, he stole an idea, and for him everything went on fine after that. Legally he was given a clean chit – case settled - the corruption of thought was legalized. It is a fair game in the hands of justice. SickoI loved Jobs because it showed how Bill Gates stole ideas from Apple (Jobs) and build his empire. It is a small part of the movie - but made me interested in the cheat and success of the wealthiest man in the world ""tag""And I wanted to see ""The Founder"" because it is a story of unsuccessful sales-person, who comes across a product (burger) of two McDonald (Dick and Mac) brothers innovative idea that excites him, makes him so passionate that he first buys a franchise and overturns into a mighty empire.It is a movie about NO morals, no conscience, no values - just the passion to succeed - ""I do not care what happens to the other"" types.From a struggling small franchise owner of McDonald – Ray Kroc transforms it to an empire by a tweak in his ambitious plans of making it a property / land business where McDonald is set up - and that gives him a leverage of money pouring in to an extend that Ray Kroc in turn buys out the name of McDonalds and even the buys out the original outlet and brings the McDonald brother duo to a humiliating acceptance of cruel reality called American Dream with a court settled case with a ""handshake"".People celebrate Mark Zuckerberg, people imitate Bill Gates and people want to be like Ray Kroc. Sad, sad, sad...It is a story of persistence, ruthlessness and undying ambition. The story unfolds with a pace that makes us intrigue in the proceedings of what this Ray Kroc will do next - to overthrow and capture the McDonald and make it a world-wide phenomenon.The story-telling of the movie at places dulls. But the acting of Michael Keaton as Ray Kroc is perfect in terms of reflecting the age and restlessness and overcoming odds. The pitiful characters of Dick and Mac McDonalds are played by Nick Offerman and John Caroll Lynn perfectly. Laura Dern as Ray Kroc's wife Ethel plays her role as usual.Today McDonald is running in 100 countries and selling 1 billion burgers a year (claiming they feed 1 billion hungry mouths)When Ray Kroc died - he donated all his wealth to a charity foundation. So much so for cheating people, getting rich, and doing philanthropy. The direction of John Lee Hancock is good. As usual the story, writing and screenplay of the movie (as usual of John Lee films) are the winner here.I will rate 7 out of 10",The Founder

Whether you love the McDonald's brand or hate it, this film offers a compelling view into the way it has captivated us all with its worldwide presence.In 1954, salesman Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) meets with brothers Dick (Nick Offerman) and Mac (John Carroll Lynch) McDonald, the owners of the hamburger restaurant known as ""McDonald's"". Fascinated by the brothers' ability to have burgers and fries cooked in a matter of seconds, Kroc suggests the idea of franchising the restaurant nationwide, hoping to use this as a way to take control of the company and earn money for himself.Featuring yet another terrific performance from the ever-versatile Michael Keaton, his second best behind Birdman, The Founder is an interesting look into the way one man helped turn a small hamburger restaurant into a global fast food empire. It is fascinating seeing how one simple idea - fast food - has changed the culinary world forever. However, one cannot help but feel sorry for the misfortune the McDonald brothers went through as a result of franchising their name and the exploitation they received. I should also mention that the film reminded me of the 2010 film The Social Network, with its similar plot about one man exploiting a clever idea from two brothers for his own financial gain.I rate it 8/10.",The Founder
82,CANpatbuck3664,The Founder Provides a Nourishing and Well Balanced Movie Going Experience,9,25 January 2017,"Sometimes it kind of sucks loving movies and living in a small town. I wanted to see this as soon as I saw the trailer but it was only available in a limited release. So I had to wait for the expansion in the release after the new year came around. So I made the trip up to a larger city with a couple of good friends to get the chance to go see it. I walked away from the theatre impressed with the movie and glad I made the trip. The Founder could have taken the easy route, painting Ray Kroc as the cartoon villain but the movie rises above that and shows us a balanced and unflinching look at the creation and expansion of the McDonald's brand.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* When you think of people that have created billion dollar empires, you don't picture them where Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) is. It's 1954 and Kroc is slinging milkshake mixers on a diner to diner basis. He's got a nice pitch but his mixers aren't selling, his pitch is met with rejection, dismissal and slammed doors. After trying his luck, he gets food at the diners. He's unimpressed by the service, the quality of the product and the clientele. He puts on a brave face though when he's calling his wife Ethel (Laura Dern) and after feeding her some half-truths about his sales, he goes to be listening to an album about the ""Power of Persistence."" The next day he calls up head office and they tell him there's an order for 6 mixers out in San Bernardino, California. Ray thinks it's a joke so he calls the location and Dick McDonald (Nick Offerman) answers the phone. The order turns out to be genuine and instead of following his normal route, he heads out to California to see what kind of operation the McDonald brothers are running.I didn't know the story about McDonald's so I went in only knowing what the trailer showed. The trailer kind of made Kroc out to be a snake hiding in the grass, which would have still been interesting but the biggest surprise when it came to The Founder was that it took a pretty balanced look at how McDonald's was created. We see Kroc in the beginning and he's more like the hero you would see in a biopic. He's treated poorly by almost everyone because he was out there trying his best to create something. He's got vision but neither the capital nor the idea to realize it. The movie also shows that he had a lot of good business ideas that represented why he was so valuable. He tries new things like targeting blue-collar franchisees instead of the rich and he's dedicated to maintaining a high standard of quality. He's not afraid to roll up his sleeves to do it either. Don't get me wrong, Kroc is a villain and you'll hate him by the end but I appreciated how the movie didn't just distract you from the fact he was essential to this operation.Having seen The Founder now, I can't believe that it didn't garner some consideration for Best Picture. But the bigger surprise is that there weren't any nominations for Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor come out of this. I think this may be Michael Keaton's best work, considering his recent output (Birdman and Spotlight) I think that's a pretty big compliment. He conveys such a wide range of emotions through just his facial expressions. He brings some warmth to Kroc at the start but he's frightening when Kroc's motivations turn more sinister. I liked Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch just as much. They seemed to have a real rapport as brothers, they brought some comedic relief early in the movie but they both really sell the drama at the end. B.J. Novak and Laura Dern were good in their supporting parts. Linda Cardellini was a scene-stealer in her parts with Michael Keaton.If I had a complaint with this movie, although the first 20 minutes was important to setup Kroc as a character, the movie was pretty slow at that point. It picks up though when he gets to San Bernardino and it didn't suffer any pacing problems after that point. The other thing I would like to talk about is that those of you who always want a happy ending, don't expect one here. The ending was a real gut-punch, the events that happen made me want to yell at the screen. To provoke that kind of reaction from me means the movie did it's job.The Founder is a great mix of being informative about a restaurant chain that some of us come into contact with almost everyday. It also provides the right amount of drama to keep things interesting. I really enjoyed this movie and I wish it had gotten the awards attention I think it deserved. It has more mass appeal than the distributor gave it credit for. It hits the notes you need to see in a biopic but it provides more perspective and development than other similar titles. If you can find this at a theatre near you, go check it out.",The Founder
83,cliftonofun,A unique take on the classic American story,7,27 December 2017,"Somewhere around half way through, this movie went from a classic American story of grit and persistence and entrepeneurism to a cautionary tale. And that's when it got interesting. Keaton and Offerman were brilliant, and they help the movie human and messy. All too often, that's the missing element of stories like this. It got too cute and perfect at certain points, but it also gave a unique glimpse into what success really requires of us.",The Founder
84,oOoBarracuda,The Founder,7,7 February 2017,"I had been looking forward to seeing The Founder for quite some time, so I thought my Birthday was the perfect reason to treat myself to the film. Michael Keaton stars as either the best business mogul of the 1950's or the most ruthless of men in the 2016 John Lee Hancock film detailing the pursuit of franchising the McDonald's brand. The Founder tows a fine line of detailing a story highlighting an underhanded individual without painting him in a more negative light than his character necessitates. The Founder succeeds creating an engaging story along with a personal history that would change the face of America forever.In a brilliant opening monologue, Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) begins to detail the life he used to live as a traveling salesman before happening upon a revolutionary restaurant idea. In 1954, while Ray was traveling the midwest with his milkshake mixer, he checks in with his secretary to learn that a restaurant in California has ordered eight. Ray was having enough trouble selling one at a time so an order for eight was so jarring he assumed it to be a mistake. After calling the restaurant and speaking to the owner, who changed his order of the mixers to 10, Ray just knew he had to see a restaurant handling such volume himself. After making the long trip to San Bernardino, California, Kroc saw for himself that there was indeed a restaurant thriving enough to need the 10 mixers and all he could see was a golden opportunity to make money. After Dick (Nick Offerman) and Mac (John Carroll Lynch) gave Kroc the grand tour of their restaurant and detailed outline of their innovative business plan that birthed the fast food industry. Kroc leaves California relentlessly energized and focused on his plan to franchise the booming McDonald's restaurant. Kroc's wife, Ethel (Laura Dern) stays faithfully devoted to her husband despite his constant neglect. Kroc is a man that is incapable of caring too much for anyone, viewing people as disposable entities that can help his chances of business success, or be discarded if they no longer benefit his pursuits. Like a dog with a bone, Kroc maneuvers his way into the McDonald business, callously making changes and underhanded deals until he manages to push the brothers to the fringes of their own innovation. No matter how ruthless, Kroc believed his destiny was to become a mogul, and he would stop at nothing to see that destiny to fruition.Michael Keaton is one of those actors that is always wonderful. Keaton is always able to take hold of each role he takes and makes it believable and his own, no matter how diverse the roles are. Whether he's playing a snowman or a superhero, Keaton becomes the role while still maintaining his own charms. Laura Dern is an absolute treasure. I wish Dern was in more films so I could see her more often and in more lead roles, but I treasure her work in David Lynch films and had her star shone brighter, we might have missed out her perfection with Lynch. Anyway, like always, Dern doesn't have much to do in The Founder but she makes the most with her screen time with her non verbals, dominating her scenes. I had never before paid any attention to Nick Offerman, but for me, he owned the film, outshining even Keaton. I guess it's finally time I check out Parks and Recreation. John Carroll Lynch was exceptional as well as a soft counterpart to Nick Offerman's militant portrayal of Dick McDonald. Each performance in this film was stellar, and The Founder truly is a film that is performance-heavy. The period detail is exquisite and the costume design superb. It's easy to portray the 50's in a cheesy overdone way, and The Founder avoids this common pitfall. As mentioned above, John Lee Hancock doesn't pick a side in this battle, he simply gives ample screen time to both sides and lets the audience make the decision as to whether Kroc was a money-hungry selfish mogul, or the McDonald brothers were naive, overly trusting individuals more interested in chasing their dreams than making money. The Weinstein Company serves up the right order with The Founder!",The Founder

87,trinaboice,The story you didn't know about McDonald's,8,5 February 2017,"Grade: B+Rating: PG-13, 115 minutesIn a Nutshell: The Golden Arches! You may actually want to swing by McDonald's after you leave the theater to celebrate the American Dreameither that or ban it because of what Ray Kroc did to the real McDonald brothers in order to build his fast food empire.It's a fascinating look at business, persistence, and the history of America's original fast food chain. According to the movie, every day, McDonald's feeds 1% of the world's population!Uplifting theme: Hard work, persistence, the American Dream ""They all lack the one thing that makes McDonald's special"" – Ray ""Which is?"" – Dick McDonald ""Even YOU don't know what it is!"" – Ray ""Enlighten me."" – Dick ""It's not just the system, Dick. It's the name, that glorious name. It can be anything you want it to be. It's limitless. It sounds like America."" – Ray If you're an older entrepreneur, you'll be inspired by these older men who made it big later in life.Things I liked: I love what director John Lee Hancock did with the movies Saving Mr. Banks and The Blind Side. He has become quite the storyteller when it comes to biopic dramas. Michael Keaton gives a great performance, especially shines when Ray Kroc's behavior gets worse and worse. His piano duet Linda Cardellini was charming. The tennis court scene was fascinating to watch. Brilliant planning, eh? Parks and Recreation: The Complete Series fan favorite Nick Offerman plays Dick McDonald. You get to see video of the real Ray Kroc at the end of the film. You also get to see pictures of the real people who played secondary roles in this true story, as well as read what happened to them. Interesting stuff.Things I didn't like: Some people will be a bit bored. So, the moral of the story seems to be that you can step on people, be unscrupulous and win in the end...? You'll leave the theater in a bit of a downer. It's not a ""feel good"" story with a happy ending that leaves you morally inspired. So, Ray Kroc was basically a thiefhe stole a business and he stole someone's wife. He's a scoundrel, but because Michael Keaton plays Ray Kroc, you somehow cheer for him during the movie. I kind of felt bad for Laura Dern. Both she and Ethel Kroc, whom she played, probably both wished they could have been given a bigger part in the McDonald's story.Interesting lines: ""McDonald's can become America's new church: feeding bodies and feeding souls, and it ain't just open on Sundays, boys."" – Ray Kroc ""There are many things we could do to make a quick buck, but that doesn't mean we should."" – Dick McDonald ""There's a wolf in the hen house. We let him in!"" – Dick McDonald Good things come to those who wait."" – Joan Smith (Linda Cardellini) ""You think big Joan, don't you?"" – Ray ""Is there any other way to?"" – Joan ""Contracts are like hearts. They're made to be broken."" – Ray ""Business is war."" – Ray ""We will never beat him. We will never be rid of him."" – Mac McDonald (John Carroll Lynch) ""So, if you can't beat 'em, buy 'em?"" - Dick ""You're not in the food businessyou're in the real estate business."" - Harry Sonneborn (played by the all grown up B.J. Novak)Funny lines: ""When is enough going to be enough for you?"" – Ethel Kroc (Laura Dern) ""Honestly, probably never."" – Ray Kroc ""Would you eat at a place named Kroc's?"" - RayTips for parents: Some profanity, including 1 F-bomb. Those of us who grew up when McDonald's was truly popular (60's & 70's) will enjoy learning more about this American icon. None of my kids ever liked McDonalds, so the younger generations of viewers will probably only be mildly entertained by this movie.",The Founder
88,rubenm,The birth of the burger business,7,20 February 2017,"Suppose the McDonald brothers would never have placed an order for a new milkshake machine with Ray Kroc's company. The world would have looked different. Kroc would never have met the brothers, he would never have admired their restaurant concept, he wouldn't have built McDonald's into a multi-billion empire, many similar fast food chains would never have existed, and the world population would have been a lot healthier.But they did place the order. The film shows what happened next: the super-ambitious, ruthless businessman Ray Kroc convinces the McDonald brothers to franchise their concept. But when the empire grows, they lose control over the concept and step by step, Kroc takes over. In the end, he convinces himself and the rest of the world that he is the founder of McDonald's, and literally wipes the original restaurant from the face of the earth.Ray Kroc is a very interesting character. At first, you can't help but admire his ambition. He wants to grow the business, to try new things, to conquer the world. The brothers, on the other hand, are happy with what they have, and are reluctant to try on new things. You're inclined to side with Kroc, the dynamic entrepreneur. He seems nice enough, and convinces people to invest money or start a restaurant. But as the movie continues, his character becomes less and less sympathetic. In the end, Kroc breaches his contract with the brothers and tells them they don't have the money to sue him. Not only does he more or less steal the restaurant concept, he also steals someone else's wife, and he even steals the text of an important speech he has to give. During the film, his image changes from sympathetic to unpleasant and even heartless.Michael Keaton is perfect in showing this subtle mix of characteristics. He is the smooth, smiling sales rep, but also the inpatient businessman who throws down the telephone receiver when he doesn't like the way the conversation goes. The film itself also shows both sides of the coin: you have to admire Ray Kroc for having built this fabulous business empire against all odds, but on the other hand your sympathy goes out to the two deceived brothers who are happy with their restaurant and who appreciate values like honesty and trust.The film is also nice because of the optimistic and joyful way the fifties and sixties are shown. It has a certain happy, fun-loving touch to it, that makes you smile despite Ray Kroc's despicable business ethics.",The Founder

But do let people know the history of how it became such an icon? In Founder, you discover the circumvented route that Mr. Krog took to to make the hamburger an American food staple today. Michael Keaton does a marvelous job bringing to life this hard-working krumugen. Not a typical rags to riches tale but one of hard work and a very competitive work ethic. McDonald's not only changed the food landscape but what we consider is common place today, fast food. I found the movie interesting and entertaining with a little business savvy on the side.

91,CineMuseFilms,"A tale of treachery, greed and a code of ethics toxic enough to spoil a Big Mac.",8,26 November 2016,"Biographical dramas tell stories about significant people in history but they are always much more than that. The person chosen for the bio-pic reflects something about the values of the era and the society from which they came. In this sense, The Founder (2016) goes well beyond the story of a global hamburger empire to the values that made McDonald's possible and it does not paint a pretty picture. The mantra ""persistence is everything"" is heard at the beginning and the end of this film but when decoded it means persistent treachery, greed, and a code of ethics toxic enough to remove some gloss from the world's most recognised golden arches.The real founders are brothers Maurice (John Lynch) and Richard McDonald (Nick Offerman) who pioneered the idea of standardised burgers made quickly that led to the modern fast-food industry. Into their lives came Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton), a struggling milkshake-mixer salesman who is amazed at the queues of people lined up for burgers and fries. The brothers trust Ray, tell him their secrets, and in 1954 Ray becomes the franchise manager responsible for setting up new stores. Driven by insatiable greed, Ray wants to go national but the brothers fear loss of quality control. When Ray realises that owning the property on which stores operate gives him complete control of the business, his takeover plans are rolled into place.The storyline follows the facts of history but it is the film's characterisations that are its real achievement. Perhaps best known for his extraordinary performance in Birdman (2014) Michael Keaton is in a class of his own when it comes to portraying deeply flawed people living on the edge of sanity or evil. From the opening scenes his eyes express callous disregard for others, and at one point he boasts that if a competitor was drowning he would not hesitate to put a running hose deep down the victim's throat. His flawed humanity is contrasted by the authenticity and honesty represented by the brothers. Excellent casting, directing and period sets make this a thoroughly engaging story.This film also arrives with remarkable timing given the current global spotlight on the home of capitalism. Millions of McDonald's fans are regularly processed by one of the most sophisticated marketing machines on the planet. Seeing The Founder is a bit like finding out that Santa Claus is Satan in disguise. Good cinema not only entertains: it shows the world as it is, not as we believe it should be.

95,James_De_Bello,6/10,6,15 January 2017,"""The Founder"" follows the real life story of Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) and how he went from a fading salesman in his late fifties to building the empire known as McDonald's starting from a small town restaurant owned by the McDonald brothers.Having loved ""Saving Mr. Banks"" despite not even having any kind of special emotional attachment to ""Mary Poppins"", i was genuinely excited to see Hancock bring this bigger than life story to the screen supported by the great Micheal Keaton. Whilst it has plenty of grit and flare to spare for the audience, I found this to never really come together in a fascinating way and sadly always remaining on the surface, which fortunately has enough to entertain at the least.Keaton is once again on fire here and continues to strike with a series of performances that have made him come back from a faded star to now being one of the most respected A listers. He has an innate sense of physicality with his character that always adds a world of layers to them. He gives Ray ticks and ways of moving and evolves them through the film and his development, it is subtle work by an actor that really makes the world of difference. The way his mouth twitches or how he becomes imposing in a scene, it is all brilliant work on top of a performance that is already very good when delivering the dialogue.The rest of the cast unfortunately stays a little anonymous and not even veterans like Laura Dern really manage to stick out, the only exceptions are Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch that just as Keaton are doing brilliant physical performance work. The contrast between how Ray carries himself and how the brothers do so made for some really interesting subtext and visual flare. The two of them also sell being affectionate brothers in a way that I have rarely experienced in movies, they really felt genuine family to one another and their sweet and innocent dynamic was both a surprise and a great element of the film.Where the film has faults is in building a climactic story and an insightful look at this real life events. There is an informative and quite interesting look at the chronology of the events, they are presented to you clearly and I did not get lost for a second on what was going on. Yet. the film has a hard time on building on what happens, it does not raise the stakes or intensify the drama, it always stays a little flat, leaving all on the surface and often repeating the same dynamics over and over again between the characters without ever resolving them, from Ray and his wife to Ray and the brothers, there isn't really a depth into which the films taps into, it just presents a back and worth with the characters and leaves it hanging until a final scene of quick resolution.The film also has some very sloppy editing, there are moments that actually stick out as good stuff like some of the montages of the McDonald's empire growing and of Ray building the business, but for a good portion of the film there is some really bad stuff. Continuity mistakes start very early on and keep popping in and being disorientating, a lot of the flow of some scenes is unnecessarily cut with double the edits that the scenes require.From a comedic perspective too the film doesn't really make up its mind, as everything it stays of surface and never really delves into interesting comedic aspects. There are basic gags that don't really get out of the audience much more than a smile and because of that you are rarely ever clear if you are watching a drama or a comedy. That is also due to an honestly underwhelming score that, just as the editing, was really off putting at times, especially early on.Still, ""The Founder"" isn't a bad film, it offers enough of what it promises for viewers to be entertained for its duration even though there is much more that could have become of it if some with a more risky or quirky take on the material.",The Founder
96,colewaters,Fair,5,22 January 2017,The founder was fair. Michael Keaton fell a little flat in this movie. The movie had high and low moments but mostly low. It was about how McDonald's became what it is today and I was like who cares about McDonald's it is a fast food chain not a interesting story for the big screen in my option. If it was about the Madison Square garden then I think it would have been a little more interesting. Parents I don't even think a kid would even want to see this unless they love biography like I do. Because I love biographies a lot. I am not saying the movie was bad but it was not a outstanding movie. The film had a great great concept but it did not follow through with the concept.

97,coreyjdenford,Not Lovin' It,6,17 February 2017,"This review of The Founder is spoiler free*** (3/5)THERE IS ALWAYS something to admire when a director wants to create a biopic based on a world-wide fast-food restaurant and focus on the ambitious people behind the restaurant business, making their dream a reality. Then director John Lee Hancock's latest flawed, yet, simply powerful biopic about the dawn of the McDonald's franchise is something we have been searching for. As we know Ray Kroc built an entire empire by placing thousands of buildings with the symbol we all recognise all over the world. But it may surprise you to know that the life of McDonald's is a lie from which this biopic's title clearly shows. We open with Kroc (Michael Keaton) an ambitious businessman who's stuck couriering milkshake machines all over the country, while having a bite to eat at the different restaurants; he then receives a giant order from a drive-in in California. He goes there with his machine and sees the thing of dreams, we meet with the two brothers, Richard and Maurice McDonald (Nick Offerman, John Carroll Lynch) they tell him that they dreamed of opening a restaurant and invented a system of serving food - fast. There is an interesting, yet, slightly mis-placed montage of how these two brothers defeated the fast-food system, Ray has an epiphany he has to have their idea, his persistence, ambitiousness and ruthlessness (this is clear later), makes his dream comes true - of owning a fast-food franchise. The brothers don't want to give it up straightaway; Ray has to show what he can bring to the table. But they don't see their dream in Ray's, they think that he is big-headed (this becomes clear too). There is a second montage that gives the film extra footing, when Rey is talking about giving the restaurant a family friendly feel. Hancock plays this with almost perfect execution; unfortunately the material in the second act is slightly over-cooked and tastes a tad bitter, the film's story falls flat - seemingly never gaining its footing. There is something to love here, even though he's big-headed with his American dream Keaton's part of a sultry businessman goes smoothly, his performance is decent he's the beating heart when the film falls soft. In addition the chemistry between Ray and his wife (Laura Dern) plays its part with clarity. The Founder has some of the McDonald's heart, there is a lot of material here but, unfortunately the middle is left, lofty and over-cooked.VERDICT: A flawed biopic, with something to love and decent performances, unfortunately the film is left over-cooked with its material.",The Founder
98,jtncsmistad,"""The Founder"": From Busted to Billions of Burgers Bought",8,31 December 2017,"The late Ray Kroc was a selfish, conniving, hard drinking, ruthless jerk. He was also the driving force behind the most successful restaurant franchise in the history of mankind. And what man, or woman, has not partaken in a meal from Kroc's iconic Golden-Arched eateries? If you've never dined at McDonald's you would certainly seem to be among a minority, as 1% of the planet's population feeds from the bistro's menu every single day.Michael Keaton continues his brilliant career resurgence with an Oscar-caliber performance as the enigmatic hamburger king of kings. Keaton succeeds in giving us Kroc's cold-hearted crustiness certainly. But the gifted veteran actor also taps into the mostly hidden heart of this no b.s. global giant of business, as well. For example, while simultaneously stealing the original passion project of the McDonald brothers for his own, Kroc also literally offers them a blank check to do his bidding.While the guy was by and large a total a-hole, it is not made clear in the film why Kroc did not want Ethel (Laura Dern excelling in a typically natural turn), his first wife of three and of nearly 40 years, to benefit at all from the vast and burgeoning McDonalds's empire when the couple divorced in the early 1960's. Ethel is portrayed as a long-suffering supporter of an endless string of her husband's harebrained sales schemes to get rich. And yet in a scene where Kroc has the opportunity to reward his decades-long and dutiful partner he fervidly refuses to do so. Evidently this is a dynamic that Director John Lee Hancock and Writer Robert D. Siegel collectively chose not to explore. And it is particularly puzzling.""The Founder"" is a rare commodity-a movie that is damn near as educational as it is entertaining. You may come away not necessarily wanting to have learned what a crappy guy the founder of odds are is one of your fave fast food joints was in terms of how he treated too many people.

He's like a tamer version of Jordan Belfort from ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". While this movie shows how the McDonald brothers established the business (and the iconic golden arches), Kroc isn't afraid to take credit, with some help from new lover Joan (Linda Cardinelli).Unlike other biopics, ""The Founder"" avoids schmaltz and doesn't try to redeem Kroc - who revels in his ruthlessness - for the sake of a happy ending.",The Founder
101,kijii,The story behind my first pay-check job,7,29 January 2017,"This is a movie I wanted to see because of my own interest in the story. My first job, for which I received my first pay check, was at my local McDonald's in 1959 when I was 16 years old. As a high school student, I received 80 cents/hour. The McDonald's then was just like the one shown in the movie and I wanted to see how accurate the portrayal in the movie was. As it turns out, it was pretty accurate with buns, burgers. fries, a barrel from which the coke/root bear came, orange drink, and shakes. (The only difference I could find is that we wrapped the burgers in front of the customers and placed them in a warming bin until sold. There was no slide though from the grill to the warming bin as shown in the movie.) At the time only young boys and men could work there. (That was just the rule back then.) Our uniforms consisted of a paper hat with ""Speedy hamburger"" logo on the side, a white shirt with the McDonald's logo on the pocket and sleeve and an apron (all of which we could get at work without any cost to us). Most of us were familiar with the fact that Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) discovered the idea of fast food from the original McDonald's brothers, Nick (Dick Offerman) and his brother Mac (John Carroll Lynch). What I was not familiar with was who Ray Kroc was, what his background was, and the overall story of how he finally ""bought out the brothers."" The split was one that didn't happen overnight since Kroc and the McDonald brothers did try to work together for a while. The problem came with the idea of franchising the company all over the country, arguments of how to keep quality control over all the franchises and keeping the drive in the same as the McDonald's originally conceived of it. All three men were innovative and contributed to the idea, but Ray Kroc was the one who wanted the company—with its Golden Arches as American iconic symbol of America: Why shouldn't the Golden Arches be as popular as the crosses on churches and the American flags on local community buildings? Kroc had been a town-to-town salesman of all sorts of things (from paper cups to multi-spindle milk shake machines) for years before he discovered McDonald's. But, he was a dreamer too. Though he lived he Illinois with his wife, Ethel (Laura Dern), he often spent more time on the road than he did at home. This is not a essential movie by any means, but it is an interesting biopic about a man from the 1950s who was revolutionary in fast food franchising. He had to learn that franchising dealt not only with the industry itself but also real estate dealing too.",The Founder

I got exactly one feeling and that is hate towards Ray Kroc and the whole McDonalds franchise. I don't know how this film was supposed to present Kroc, because if its point is to idolise him even the slightest, I'm just even more furious about the whole thing.I got to appreciate Michael Keaton though. He doesn't portray Kroc simply as an asshole, even though that's what he is. We still see him as the jerk he was, since his actions are shown as ruthless as they were. Now of course in the capitalist wonderland this all might seem admirable, but the audience should be able to see that ruthlessness as something other than ""business blah blah blah"" or whatever it is to those same asshole businessmen. I mean I could go to a full anti-capitalist speech here, but perhaps I shouldn't. After all the fact that this movie made me actually feel something this strongly and made me think means it's a very well made movie. I didn't really have time to consider the technical side of the movie since I was mostly thinking about how angry the story made me and how much I wanted to punch Kroc.

106,bastos,"Good biopic, great Keaton",7,7 October 2020,"I thoroughly enjoyed this biopic on the life of Ray Krok, the man responsible for the franchising of the McDonald's restaurants or as he liked to call himself, the founder of the McDonald's restaurants. This seems like a simple story to tell, but it's not. Like many big corporations origin stories, this is a tale where ingenuity and greed go hand in hand, and it's hard to separate them from the success it eventually had. What makes this a hard story to tell, for me, is the fact that Krok was not a very nice man, and it's entirely told from his point of view making it very hard to empathize and root for him. But it's not that simple either, and I see a lot of people complaining about the fact that you're essentially seeing the story of a jerk that robbed the McDonald's brothers from their rightful legacy, but what people seem to forget is that if he didn't have that kind of personality you'd probably never heard of the McDonald's corporation, and as greedy as he seems he's always fighting for what he thinks is the good of the chain. And you usually need this combination of ingenuity and greed to have a very successful business story. Michael Keaton was a very good choice to portray Krok, as he exudes that very charming snake oil seller vibe, that was necessary to pull this off. All other aspects of the film are well made, with particular attention to detail on the recreation of the restaurants themselves, and the look of that era.",The Founder
107,harrylosborne,"A ""sanitised"" history of the brand",6,26 January 2021,"The Founder is a weird one for me: on the one hand, parts of this story are interesting enough to warrant this film, but on the other, I am painfully aware that McDonalds probably exerted a lot of creative control over the image this film would project (both of the brand and its creator).The Founder is not so much about the creation of the iconic brand, but more about the man who decided to franchise the business and take it regional (then national, then global). Michael Keaton is good, but I actually felt Nick Offerman (one of the founding brothers) gives the best performance here, even if it isn't a million miles away from his character in The Office.The supporting cast is equally talented with some more big names thrown in, but it is almost a one-man show revolving around Keaton. Cheesy bits of speech and some unnecessary one-liners bog down the script, plus some of major plot devices (that I won't spoil) are very much skipped over.Overall, this film is not going to change your life, but might at least grant you a mildly interesting two hours.",The Founder
108,PetarNeo,That famous name McDonald's,8,2 March 2017,"Once more John Lee Hancock brings us a new and fresh story about thing that we see all around the world but maybe never knew anything about it. With great work of Michael Keaton and effort that he put in movie alongside with very good story we got an interesting piece of art. It was a great trouble of Ray Kroc that led to reveal of the story and his drive that kept him pursuing his dreams. In the light of events and troubles that our Founder went through he expands his view and gives everybody a motive to grab an opportunity. Persistence as Kroc said is a way that everybody should move in life and gave their all to succeed. There was a dose of fun in the movie that is put in place at times so it doesn't feel like story where one man tricked them all but also wanted to enable others to be part of success. Bringing chemistry of Joan Smith (Linda Cardellini) and Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) and how they found themselves and changed their lives is pretty strange and it was intimidating to watch it on screen. Also how troubles of Ray somehow always seemed to solve themselves is quite a story. But if it wasn't for our leading guy Michael Keaton which played a famous Birdman and his charisma and innovation it would seem very different and he was a great leading man in this movie as he manages to drag us with him and give us a new view. Dick (Nick Offerman) and Mac McDonald (John Carroll Lynch) were great in their parts as they gave us different personalities but they alongside felt like being left behind and it felt like they could maybe put a bit of fight of see more beyond horizon. Franchise, franchise, franchise that glorious words that put a man on top of the world and allowed him to see his dream come true. 3/4",The Founder

In the desperate attempt to show us all how this magnificent restaurant chain formed, the staff, with the director leading the mess, they only succeeded to deliver a piece of crappy & unsuccessful ""blockbuster"".

111,ivko,A super-sized business story,8,24 September 2018,"I started watching this movie prepared to not like Ray Kroc, founder of the McDonalds Inc. brand. Of course, all I knew going in was the broad strokes of the history of the company and the fact that I worked for them for several years in high school in a job that paid minimum wage. But the crazy thing is, where the movie clearly wanted me to see a villain, I only saw a rational business strategy.The movie picks up the story with Ray in the early 50's when he was working as a traveling salesman of milkshake machines. The industry had turned in another direction, so the job was a miserable collage of various burger joints and rejections until his secretary informed him of an unusually large order coming in from a restaurant in California. Curious, Ray traveled to the original McDonalds to find out what made this place so different from all the others he had been visiting.What he discovered was a restaurant innovating way beyond the rest of their industry. From faster service to cleaner, family-friendly environments and an optimized menu and production lines, the McDonald brothers had conceived of something that he immediately recognized as being on a whole other level from everyone else. And he recognized that it was a system that could be spread across the country.Unfortunately, the brothers had attempted to do just that previously without success. The problem was standardization; making the restaurants the same in every location. Owners would be absentee landlords, letting the locations get dirty or altering the menu items and in so doing, lost the spark of greatness in the McDonald innovation.But Ray Kroc saw the possibility, and so desperately wanted to be the one to grab the opportunity that he mortgaged his home and agreed without argument to a contract the brothers drew up that put more or less all of the control in their hands, driving the wedge that would eventually destroy the partnership.The movie depicts Ray Kroc as a bit of an egotistical bully, and maybe he was, but honestly the problem I saw was just the opposite. The McDonald brothers were borderline genius, innovating ideas that would become industry standard for more than half a century, but they were also purists. Their genius had blinded them to ideas that they didn't have themselves. For example, Coca Cola offered to sponsor the restaurants, providing a constant revenue stream for formally selecting Coca Cola as the exclusive beverage supplier, which seems like a no-brainer considering they were already using Coca Cola products, but the brothers refused to hear of it. Ditto for an idea that lowered operating costs by making milkshakes from powder instead of ice cream.The thing is, you may agree or disagree with these decisions, but the salient point was that Ray Kroc had succeeded in doing what the McDonald brothers had struggled with, which was spreading their innovative design to restaurants around the country while maintaining basic standards that protected the brand. It was a remarkable achievement that they refused to see because they viewed him as an opportunist, or as one of them put it, the ""fox in the hen house"".They happily cashed his checks while disparaging his efforts. Largely, I think, because they viewed what he was doing as not up to their standards of excellence. Their own success and brilliance had made them uncompromising and dismissive. They couldn't seem to see that he was now in a better position to understand how to manage the franchise then they ever would be.The nail in the coffin, however, was the money. The original contract wasn't leaving Ray enough working capital to run the franchise operation. He repeatedly asked them to renegotiate, even offering to increase their percentage as part of the deal (by increasing franchisee costs), but they wouldn't hear of it. And that was pretty much it, because at that point he began looking for ways around their control and, well, we all know how the story of McDonalds turned out.The movie plays a little with the end of their partnership, suggesting a sequence of events that isn't really supported by the facts. I won't go into it, but sufficed to say that in interviews over the years with the McDonald brothers they had stated that they didn't feel cheated by the deal they struck with Ray. And indeed, in today's dollars they each walked away with about $10 million after taxes, more than they could have made running ten restaurants their whole lives, so I don't think they fared so badly.All in all, the movie is a fascinating look at the rise of the fast food industry as we know and love(?) it today. Michael Keaton turns in a solid and believable performance as Ray Kroc, a driven man who was maybe not so great to work for or be married to, but none the less changed the world with his vision, whether for better or worse I'll leave as a judgement call. The one part of the movie I didn't really have much interest in was the stuff about his marriages. The meat of the story is the history of the business; his marital problems always feel like more of a distraction than an interesting story. Still, all of the performances were solid and it's a fascinating story, so I'd recommend.",The Founder

This may be one of the best examples I have seen for years of film the way it should be. No interior monologues, no voice over, no big captions to explain things.Ray (Michael Keaton) has epiphanies and revelations, but you can tell because he is allowed to emote, then takes actions that show what he has learned. Really well done.It is written, directed, and edited so that the acting comes through and tells the story. Nick Offerman especially, entirely disappears into his role and is in many ways the voice of what is happening without sounding like an artificially-inserted chorus.I am reminded of the history of the game Monoopoly; It was intended to be used as a tragic warning of the evils of capitalism run amok. This I fear will be too much used the same way, as a way to revere the business sense of Ray Kroc when he's pretty clearly portrayed as a sorta horrible guy who cheated the McDonald brothers more than a bit.But, the film is played straight enough, that's also a strength in many ways.

For what it's worth, all of the main actors hit it out of the ballpark in this one. Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch as Dick and Mac were amazing. I really felt sympathetic for these guys and what they were going through in dealing with the fast-talking two-timing wheeler and dealer that is Ray Kroc, Keaton's character, who took McDonald's from a family-owned stand in San Bernadino and turned it into a national symbol and a pioneer in what we know know as ""fast food"" in the most reprehensible way possible. Did the means justify the ends? I guess that's what this movie sort of asks. Allow me to ponder that thought as I take another bite out of my Big Mac. In short, excellent film!

117,gcsman,Michael Keaton gives an acting seminar,7,30 December 2017,"A whole lot of the physical structure of our society was invented, or built, in the 1950's. One could make a good argument that nothing as sweeping happened again for more than 40 years (till the appearance of the internet and everything that has come with it). A great discussion of all this can be found in David Halberstam's excellent book ""The Fifties"", which I highly recommend. Among other things, in the 50's, suburbs and suburban housing were invented, as were the interstate highway network, the modern auto industry, widespread air travel for the millions. So were rock music and the invention of ""youth"" as a separate societal group and marketing target. TV wasn't invented in the Fifties but that's when it exploded into a major cultural force by taking over every living room in the nation.And, of course, fast food restaurants. That's what this movie is about - the invention and growth of an entirely new category of food marketing and consumption, which has now taken over the world. That's the basis of the storyline, but the heart of it is Michael Keaton's portrayal of Ray Kroc, the franchiser who took the first steps to turn a single little restaurant in San Bernardino into the McDonald's Corporation juggernaut it now is -- the world's largest restaurant chain and the first of many other such franchises that soon followed. Keaton is in practically every scene (even if just as a voice at the other end of a telephone call) and watching him work is like sitting in on a master class in acting. In his hands, Kroc comes to life as a cocky small-time businessman restlessly searching for The Big Break that will make his career, After a partly-by-chance meeting with the McDonald brothers, who are the true inventors of the fast-food methodology, he sees just what he's been looking for, and from then on he pursues it relentlessly. What we see is that Ray doesn't actually 'invent' anything. But the one thing he is very good at is recognizing good advice and opportunity when it comes along, and seizing it. As it turns out -- at least in this portrayal -- he pursues this ultimate American Dream at the cost of his humanity and even of fair business dealings. There aren't many actors as adept as Keaton at seamlessly inhabiting the inner nature of his movie characters and making them totally real people with all their good and bad sides together.There are a lot of good supporting parts. Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch play Dick and Mac McDonald and they're a completely delightful pair to watch (even if they don't look at all like brothers). The scene where they actually invent the best operational layout for their restaurant -- and thus where they conjure out of thin air the essence of the entire fast-food business -- is a wonderfully choreographed bit of cinema to watch; I can't think of anything else like it in the movies. The great Laura Dern, who plays Ray's long-suffering first wife, is excellent but is once again underused, as she is so often. Linda Cardellini and Patrick Wilson have nice parts as a couple who Ray uses as more steps up the ladder.As a story, this film can be seen either as a character comedy or an American tragedy. In the end, director John Lee Hancock seems to opt for the latter.",The Founder

By all accounts, this should have been a captivating movie starring Michael Keaton who seems to be getting better with age.The Founder never really commits to a clear picture of who the McDonald brothers were, nor who was Ray Kroc. The McDonald brothers are certainly somewhere on the autism spectrum. What other personality type would have wanted to or could have invented fast food? Their quirkiness is bemusing and not much else. We instead see more glimpses into Ray Kroc, who might be a psychopath, a salesman who knows McDonald's could spread across the globe. He emerges from a vapid life into one of billions, becoming a ruthless monster who refuses to let anyone stand in the way of his vision. He even employs selective memory and conveniently overlooks all the hard work it took to establish the Speedee system, all the exploited labor that served the billions.The biggest question left open is whether Ray Kroc was a psychopath before, or after, he became rich and powerful. The movie ignores pretty much every social aspect of commodity consumption and capitalizing on other people's work. What we are left with is about as satisfying as a Filet-O-Fish.",The Founder

In that respect, the concept is intriguing. The story flows as you would expect it to and is predictable.This would make a really good film for business students, educators, and the like, because it shows how it is done in the real world.DOWNSIDE -Michael Keaton did his best with what was given, but the character development was shallow at best... The only thing that kept the characters afloat were Keaton's ability to impersonate and the odd accents and nuances of the 1950's which they got right.I actually think Keaton was outdone performance-wise by the two McDonald brothers, Dick and Mac, whom he ""stole"" the ideas for McDonalds from. They give a very very convincing performance as two neurotic brothers that reminds me of how difficult a business partnership can be.The part where Keaton announces his divorce to his wife at the dinner table was very Deus-ex Machina I thought, ie it came out of nowhere. What exactly are we to think of this Ray Kroc guy? Is he a good guy? A bad guy? Also, at the beginning he is a struggling traveling milkshake machine salesman who has confidence and performance issues and is barely getting by. Then all the sudden, during the second half of the movie, he is the most savvy and ruthless businessman there is. Again, what are we to think of him?Keaton could have been villainized more than he was, or they could have made him into a sympathetic hero, but somewhere along the line, the plot took the form of a corporate film that they show to new McD's employees as a training video....

That film has now been made and it comes in the form of The Founder.Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) made his money as a travelling milkshake maker salesman in 1954 until the day he met Mac and Dick McDonald (John Carroll Lynch and Nick Offerman), tow brothers who own McDonald's, a single fast food joint that go about their business like no other restaurant Ray has seen before.Inspired by their meeting, Ray persuades the brothers to franchise McDonald's and, in doing so, sets in motion a trail of events that lead to McDonald's becoming the giant corporation we know it as today. The Founder is a good film but I wouldn't put it up there with films like The Social Network or Steve Jobs, mainly due to the fact that the writing doesn't really do a story of this size the justice it deserves. It plays a very safe game with both the story and characters, before bizarrely opting to turn Ray Kroc into a complete and utter prick for the final twenty minutes. I mean, he's a really likable guy at the start but then the total shift in his character for the final twenty minutes felt jarring. The story is a bit too light and fluffy for a story of such high stakes as well, when it should have been a bit more serious in tone. Not saying they should have copied The Social Network but a tone more like that would have worked better.The shining star of The Founder is undoubtedly Michael Keaton in the lead role of Ray Kroc. Keaton is one of the most underrated actors working today and he really is fantastic in this film.

He's introduced as a motormouth salesman with a strained marriage, yet he transcends this stock character and earns our sympathy through his cast iron perseverance and lack of pretension.

Director: John Lee Hancock image1.jpegThe Founder, Viewed at the Puskin Mozi in Budapest on Feb. 4, 2017, is the story of an unscrupulous promoter who turned the Original McDonald fast food hamburger stand from a single modest location into a multi-billion dollar chain of Golden Arch hamburger joints spanning the globe and symbolizing American beetle-brow culture world-wide. According to director J. L. Hancock, the film is only ""ironically"" called The Founder because the founder of this film was not the real founder of the revolutionary McDonald fast food idea, but rather the founder (and rip off artist) of the franchise extension idea which made him rich. Traveling salesman Ray Kroc (Well named because he is a gigantic crock of you-know-what) played by Michael Keaton, is trying to sell the McDonald brothers a mix-master for their small hamburger stand back in 1954 but soon realizes that they have something with big possibilities in their idea for instant customer delivery -- no waiting! His innovation is to franchise and setup clones of their stand all over the map. Thus he does, at first working for them, but when he sees larger horizons, callously by-passes them and makes the extremely profitable franchising business his own. This movie should be called The RIPOFF because he not only cons the real founders, a pair of unassuming brothers in a small California town, out of their original idea down to the Golden Arches that would become the symbol of the enterprise, and out of the profits coming to them later on the basis of an insincere one percent handshake agreement -- which they naïvely accept -- but even had the bald faced gall to rip off their name calling himself the the founder of Mcdonalds -- period.The character of Kroc is so disgusting that I finally became disgusted with the entire movie. Even the waste of normally interesting actress Laura Dern as Kroc's long suffering wife who will eventually get dumped when he finds a younger prettier gold-digger as unscrupulous as himself (the wife of a colleague, no less). Historically this film was very accurate recreating the flavor of the mid fifties with great fidelity. Even the vintage cars seen throughout are shown, or glimpsed, as ordinary vehicles of the time, not as shiny collectors show pieces thrown in for surface effect. Plaudits for the historical accuracy but McDonalds is not my cup of fast food -- (In a pinch I'll take KFC) --and watching what amounts to an extended two hour advertisement for the franchise with sizzling hunks of meat on the grill as the main event is not my idea of a motion picture. Devoted fans of Keaton praise his acting here in the glowingest of terms, but as in his equally workmanlike portrayal of an equally uninteresting anti-hero - the over the hill actor in Birdman (numerous Academy Awards, 2014) -- who, but a handful of artery hardened, sclerotic, over the hill Academy voters -- cares?

Reluctantly, they agreed but Kroc would bend and twist their contract any way he could. All changes were to his benefit and no one else.When the McDonalds brothers have had enough of the pushy, lying Kroc, they agree to sell out to the greedy bastard. Kroc refuses to put their royalties clause in writing. The brothers reluctantly agree to a handshake deal and thereby lose out on franchise royalties to the tune of tens of millions per year.Along the way, Kroc credits himself as ""The Founder"" of McDonalds even though he was not.Kroc even denies the brothers the right to retain their own name on their original restaurant which soon closes as Kroc opens his own McDonalds franchise just yards away.I came away from the film hating Kroc and people like him - evil, immoral, greedy business people who take advantage of good honest hard-working people who actually do invent and develop something worthwhile. This film at least sheds light on the McDonald brothers for the good honest and brilliant men they were. McDonalds restaurants are their legacy - not Ray - the crook - Kroc.",The Founder

133,pinokiyo,MUST SEE! I'm Lovin' It. Parapapapa~ Excellent storytelling execution/cast/performance/production,9,24 February 2017,"It's so true... can you imagine having to say ""I want to eat some Kroc's today?"" HahaNo, we don't need/want car chases, explosions, sex, or super heroes for a film to be entertaining - it's great storytelling - and that is exactly what we get with this film. I hardly ever eat McDonald's now, but I love this movie. (Parapapapa~ sorry, I had to do it.) Those golden arches... like the crosses on a church, McDonald's is practically a religion, spreading world wide. People eat it religiously. No matter what country you're visiting, when you see McDonald's, you feel a bit back at home/comfort food. McDonald's really is America. (Obese/Capitalism... just kidding) Haha. It's really interesting to see how In'N'Out carries out their business today; they basically copied/kept exactly the core values of the original McDonald's - what made it so great - before it fell into the hands of commercial capitalism/greed. If you've never heard of McDonald's, you must live in a closet. It's everywhere. However, most people don't really know how McDonald's really began and the dark sides of it... It's such a fascinating story, you wonder why they never made a movie out of it until now. From the amazing, perfectly cast performances, to the 1950's production set, fantastic editing/pacing, and most importantly the screen writing/storywriting (some great hilarious clever dialogues!), the film just executes it all beautifully.Michael Keaton is on the top of his game as the ""Founder"", Ray Kroc, where he plays an anti-hero. You love him and hate him. On one side, you could respect his hardworking passion/persistence from starting from nothing, not inheriting wealth - but on the other hand, he turns into a vicious shark. I love how people can interpret the man differently as corrupt or admirable. You can tell Keaton really studied the man. Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch as the McDonald's brothers (Dick and Mac) are also so perfect, just so sweet and defenseless. I also love how you can interpret the ending differently based on how you look at life. Is success based on wealth/money (in our capitalistic world, it seems so), but what about having some dignity? Are the McDonald's brothers really the losers or Ray Kroc the sore winner? Can you be extremely successful and also still be kind/grounded without drowning into greed and power? Businesses are just full of sharks, dog eat dog world, it's rather sad when you step back and see how people end up becoming. It's also rather interesting to see it's really no different than how other major multi-billion dollar companies ended up too, like Steve Jobs/Apple and Bill Gates/Microsoft with Windows or Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook. ALL THE SAME! I was engaged and entertained the whole 2 hour film. You'd imagine a film about a business would be dull and boring, but this is a way better film than something like The Social Network. It just flows really well and Michael Keaton isn't annoying like Jesse Eisenberg speaking a thousand words a minute. The film doesn't get to modern day of Happy Meals or how the Ronald McDonald, or his weird other mascot character friends began, so if that's all you're expecting, it's not for you. This is not a Happy Meal kids movie. However, I'd also be interested to see a film covering how all those other things began too. This film really makes you want to learn more about the company (and eat those old basic hamburger too... oh no, I've been brainwashed). McDonald's now supposedly uses white meat now in their Chicken McNuggets, but I remember in the early 90's, there were some pieces of the nerve/blood vessels when you took a bite out of them. While the film doesn't ever get into chicken nuggets either, it brings in similar light about those kind of issues regarding milk shakes to save costs; it's interesting. After watching this film, it makes you want to know more about the film, the company, and even makes you want to visit the first McDonald's location museum... or even have a burger. I could go for their basic cheese burger now. Haha... on second thought, I think I'll have some In'N'Out. It will really change the way you see McDonald's... not necessarily in a bad way, but I guess more ""appreciation"" knowing more about its history. I like the ambiguity of Keaton's last scene; is he feeling some guilt? Personally, I'd say screwing them on their royalties with a hand shake/building another McDonald's across the street says no. Oh and Michael Keaton can really sing!Like most Hollywood films, everything is not 100% accurate; for example, Kroc did not actually have a cross country drive, but he took a plane from Illinois to San Bernardino.",The Founder
134,valen060,How One Small Burger Shop Became Captivatingly Lucrative,9,21 January 2017,"Director John Lee Hancock has made some wonderful film dramas from The Rookie, The Blind Side and Saving Mr. Banks, so for his follow-up titled The Founder. I found it to be quite intriguing as to see how the fast food restaurant McDonald's came to be when one traveling salesman came up with the most lucrative way to make such a small burger shop in San Bernardino become a huge franchise. Whether it be Batman, Beetlejuice, Birdman, this has to be such a transition into him channeling of all his notable roles, Mr. Ray Kroc.In 1954, Ray Kroc (Keaton) was just an average salesman traveling the U.S. selling milkshake mixers to potential diners but to little success. However, upon receiving a call from two brothers by the names Richard ""Dick"" and Maurice ""Mac"" McDonald requesting to buy mixers from him, he sees more to the brothers' shop than just being systematic and timely in prepping and serving hamburgers to customers.What I found baffling and intriguing at the same time is the way Kroc went through many cut-throat and costly tactics to get the restaurant going from just three to four distant locations to an expansive set of locations nationwide. Michael Keaton delivered such a performance to the point of being loathsome, spiteful, yet strategizing as Kroc himself. Whereas Nick Offerman (Parks & Recreation, 21 Jump Street) and John Carroll Lynch (Paul, Jackie) were also great portraying the original pioneers of their namesake shop. I had no idea that these brothers had the blueprints and system into making the workflow become as steadfast as shown on screen. In short, it was what they called a ""burger symphony."" Also, the conflicts they've had with Kroc felt discerning and dubious at first due to Dick's reluctance in getting the restaurant he started with his brother going farther than he envisioned. I cannot say which side I rooted for most, but ""pride"" seems to be the one thing that fueled both sides. Dick wanted to protect the inner sanctity of his shop as a family-owned restaurant, but to Kroc it was so much more that he wanted to share it with the world.In the end, I was left speechless and with so much thought into how this one fast food chain I've come to know in life made such an impression not just within old Americana, but to many countries that spawned their own locations as well in later years, thus changing culture on its own accord. These days, I know its many restaurants have undergone a drastic change to appeal to an older crowd as well, but seeing the classic design of the first original McDonald's location visited by families was pretty uncanny, nifty, and nostalgic at the same time too. And Kroc found an opportunity by rolling with it by any means necessary despite how harsh and cunning it looked. Not bad. Check it out and see what you think.",The Founder

Kroc IS the Founder of McDonalds-if they had never met the guy they never would have cashed cheques for the equivalent of 17 million dollars each in today's dollars and he gave them the chance to become mega mega rich simply by noticing that the guy knew how to make the thing work-but their pride and egotism could not accept his leadership.,The Founder

139,TheCasualReviewer,That Ray guy is a crock-of-s***,8,31 August 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
This film tells the untold story of how Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) bullies is way into becoming the unofficial founder and CEO of McDonalds.REVIEW:
I have absolutely no idea why this film flew under the radar. From the story to the performances, this film deserves Oscar nominations at the very least. Nick Offerman and John Carol Lynch as the McDonald brothers are delightful. They have very good chemistry and the back and forth between Dick (Offerman) and Ray were done so well. If I had never seen this and looked up the founder of McDonalds, I would've been led to believe this Ray Kroc guy started the whole thing up. As far as how accurate this story is, I can't really tell and it doesn't seem like any of them have really spoken on the film. From what I can find, the story is pretty accurate or at the very least, the the characters in the film are depicted accurately. The pacing of this film is perfect, it doesn't seem too long and they fit the exact right amount of the beginning of McDonald's history, the middle and end. They start from when McDonalds is still very much a start up, but consistently doing well. A very nice 10-minute anecdotal history telling of McDonalds happens within the first 30 minutes of the film and at the point I was hooked. I wanted to see the whole thing unfold.The writing of this film was spectacular, the acting was great and it was a pleasure to watch the whole way through and you'll hate Ray Kroc by the end of the film. 8.9/10.",The Founder
140,antony-1,A thoroughly enjoyable tale of two halves,8,16 October 2018,"This movie feels like a tale of two halves, a good bait and switch.It starts off on the right size of schmaltzy, with a glossy look at America 1950s and the founding of the first (the real first) McDonald's by the McDonald's brothers. Everything is rosy and glorious and Keaton plays Kroc, an optimistic have-a-go-salesman. He evokes somewhat Saul Goodman, from Better call Saul. But the movie shifts gear - quite suddenly in fact - and the movie shows how Kroc soon lets something - greed, avarice, entrepreneurialism or something take control of him. Take your pick, it's perhaps a bit of all of the above.It expertly moves the viewer from a warm fuzzy feeling to a sense of admiration and injustice all at the same time. The players are the same, but the mood has changed significantly.It's also a tale of two sides of capitalism. It's hard to not reach the end and think: Kroc was right. McDonald's was another enterprise that would never have scaled due to the tight grip of its owners (like so many businesses) and he had the commercial know-how to scale it. But then on the other side it's hard to not see the dangers of unfettered capitalism, when the individual is cheated, demeaned and ruined. And I mean ruined as people. They may have money in their pocket, but they have lost the vital human requirement of dignity.The cast is excellent, the production spot on. My only complaint is that the turn of Kroc feels extremely sudden. He does an about turn in about 5 minutes of the film. I would have preferred to see some of his darker elements before the turnabout, or more time spent focusing on why he seemingly changed. But that is not a dealbreaker in what was a very enjoyable movie.",The Founder

142,eparazak,"A great depiction of how corporate something can become, based on true events!",7,28 January 2017,"The Founder is based on the founding of McDonalds, the fast food kings in which it became the fast food franchise we know today. Ray Kroc, played by Michael Keaton, becomes curious about the restaurant and heads down to San Bernadino and eventually forms a relationship with the McDonald's brothers.While a bit bland, the movie looks into both the history of the founding of McDonalds and the relationship of the brothers and Kroc. I liked the visual representation of what the restaurants would look like during their olden days. I especially liked what they did with the prototype assembly line during the flashback scene where they drew out what it would look like with chalk. I know that this is what actually happened considering the fact that this is based on a true story, but I still find it impressive and interesting.The movie also gives us a look at the relationship between the brothers and Kroc. The relationship starts out well, but until Kroc's decisions start becoming corporate, things begin to go downhill. This is a fantastic and very realistic depiction of how something small and innocent can become so corporate with just one person. Considering the fact that this was based on the founding McDonald's, it truly helps set up how realistic business practices can be.",The Founder
143,daddysarm,Solid story-telling & excellent acting,8,19 August 2017,"Michael Keaton is superb, as always. Offerman, Novak, Dern are all great. And I am glad I watched the end credits. That was Linda Cardellini from Freaks & Greaks as Ray's 2nd wife & the genius behind powdered milkshakes. I wonder if Joan thought of frozen fries, also. I'll say this film is a great litmus test for how whiny & ineffectual people have become in our world's rapid descent into socialism. I'll bet half the reviewers call Ray names. Well, I have a short fuse for jerks & psychos, but almost everything Ray did was fine. People get divorced all the time for less than Ray was running from. I'll bet plenty of the people who call Ray names are divorced. Stuff happens. And, the McDonald boys were just obstructionists. They just liked to say ""no"". They had no vision. They didn't even really care about quality. How many times did they travel out of CA to see one of Ray's sites? Everything Ray proposed prior to the split was the right thing to do. They just liked to say ""no"". The only things you can really blame Ray for is was stiffing them on royalties, making them take their name off their own restaurant & then moving into San Bernadino to put them out of business. But here's the simple reality, if the negative-nannies weren't so unable to figure out how to make a proper profit, they would have been able to afford better lawyers & they could have stood toe-to-toe with Ray.",The Founder
144,makleen2,A compelling portrayal of American business and the price of success,9,29 September 2017,"The Founder (2016) stars Michael Keaton as Ray Kroc, who took a local California fast food restaurant called McDonald's and turned it into a global, multi-billion dollar empire. Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch co-star as McDonald's founders Richard and Maurice McDonald. It was written by Robert Siegel and directed by John Lee Hancock, who also directed Saving Mr. Banks (2013) and The Blind Side (2009).Ray Kroc was born in Oak Park, Illinois and he opened his first McDonald's franchise on Lee Street in Des Plaines, where I grew up. I passed by the old McDonald's museum hundreds of times, but never knew the story of how McDonald's got its start. Ray Kroc himself was responsible for much of the popular mythology behind the company's founding. His claim of being ""the founder,"" despite his first McDonald's restaurant actually being the ninth, was so ostentatious, it turned out to be the perfect title for a film about his life.The film charts Ray Kroc's rise from struggling milkshake salesman to restaurant/real estate mogul, his tumultuous relationship with the McDonald brothers and his wife Ethel (Laura Dern), and his unshakable faith in persistence. The movie's first half tells the inspiring story of how Kroc turns around his business prospects despite daunting odds. The second half shows him screwing over everyone who helped him along the way, even stealing a restaurant owner's wife.The Founder is historically accurate, for the most part. Some of Kroc's relationships are simplified for the sake of plot, including omitting a brief second marriage before marrying Joan, the restaurant owner's wife. In real life, Joan was not actually married to the restaurant owner as the film depicts, but to another man who became a manager at McDonald's. It also omits Ray's daughter, Marilyn.It's difficult to reconcile Kroc's personality at the beginning of the film with his personality at the end. I think the filmmakers wanted to show how success and ambition corrupted him and destroyed his personal relationships. His relationship with his business partners was a little more complex, however. The McDonald brothers basically sat back and profited from Kroc's hard work as he flew all over the country setting up franchises, while stubbornly resisting his every idea, including simple suggestions to increase profitability.The McDonald brothers didn't tell Kroc they already sold the rights to their name in Cook County, Illinois, where he wanted to open his first location. He had to pay $25,000 to buy out the contract. Later, when he finally bought out the McDonald brothers, they insisted at the closing negotiation the deal didn't include their original location. So Kroc famously made them change the name and then opened a McDonald's across the street, putting them out of business.In the film, this negotiation is portrayed as one-sided, with Kroc simply screwing the McDonald brothers out of their royalty with a handshake deal. His refusal to honor the royalty, however, was partially driven by his belief that the McDonald brothers screwed him out of their original location. At that point, I think there was genuine animosity between them. None of this is to absolve Ray Kroc of any share of the blame, but it's just to say that things were a little more complex than The Founder lets on.Director John Lee Hancock described his concept of The Founder as The Social Network (2010) meets There Will Be Blood (2007), so that helps explain why the story took this route.Nick Offerman of Parks and Recreation (2009–2015) was great as obsessive-compulsive Dick McDonald, but Michael Keaton's studied, careful portrayal of Ray Kroc carries the movie. His vocal cadence is memorable and infectious. He gets the McDonald brothers, as well as the audience, into the palm of his hand before ruthlessly crushing them. His speech, in which he lays out his vision for a McDonald's in every American town, ""the new American church,"" will go down as one of the great movie monologues.Overall, The Founder is a compelling portrayal of American business and the price of success.",The Founder

146,jay-techie2007,A good movie to watch if you want a glimpse of what made McDonald's,8,28 January 2017,"I have read the book ""McDonald's - Behind the Arches"" and I still liked this movie even though it covers only a part of it - or if I may say, just scratches the surface of it. Definitely watchable - especially if you haven't read the book.Story (8/10): The story is not about the founders of McDonald's (although it talks about it as well) but the person who made it a fast food monster it is today - Ray Kroc. Shot in the backdrop of 1950s USA when the fast food wasn't so fast, Ray Kroc witnesses a revolution in a restaurant called ""McDonald's"" in San Bernardino where two brothers, Dick McDonald and Mac McDonald, are spinning out a burger, a drink, and french fries in just 30 seconds. Awestruck by the speed, the salesman inside Ray Kroc instantly identifies the opportunity to go grand with the concept which has the potential to change the food service business forever - franchise. Being a salesman, he very well knew how to convince the brothers. The rest, as they say, is history. The story depicts the persistence of Ray Kroc and his ruthless attitude to do everything it took to realize his dream, even sideline the original inventors of the concept. The writer even went one step ahead to show that, even outside his business, Ray does whatever it takes to get what he wants. As the story progresses, you realize you start feeling for Dick and Mac and develop an awkward appreciation for Ray Kroc and that's where, perhaps, the story scores. While the story spends a little time on showing what goes behind the cash counters at McDonald's, it focused on other things - the franchise model, the real business of McDonald's - real estate, personal life of Ray Kroc, and cost of not thinking big (which McDonald brothers paid). When compared to the book, the story left out many things like the McDonald's University, the quality control process and how they revolutionized the sourcing. However, that wouldn't really fit into the script, perhaps. Acting (8/10): Michael Keaton, playing Ray Kroc, essentially took the movie on his shoulders and did a great job. His understanding of the character and the nitty-gritty is great. The expressions, dialog delivery, and the depiction of passion (or if I may say ""raw insanity"") for making McDonald's gigantic are simply brilliant. To be honest, it felt like the rest of the cast was ignored to build any strong presence in the movie. Nick Offerman, playing a ""tough-outside-timid-inside"" Dick McDonald and John Caroll Lynch, playing a ""good-guy"" Mac McDonald, did a good job but they hardly had a chance to show any kind of variety. Laura Dern, playing his wife, is good too. The rest of the cast just revolved around Michael Keaton. Direction (7/10): Identifying what's relevant and what's not is very tough in a biopic and the director, John Lee Hancock, did a good job of it. What I loved about the movie was the amount of research done on building Ray Kroc's character. At the same time, I guess that's what went wrong as well since it essentially came at the cost of the rest of the characters. The overall flow of the movie is quite smooth, so it doesn't lose audience's attention even for a second. The climax was shot very well - especially the conversation between Dick McDonald and Ray Kroc is something to watch out for. Overall (8/10): Overall, it's a good movie to watch if you want a glimpse of what made McDonald's. It wouldn't give you many technical details into McDonald's per se, but definitely watchable. Not a memorable movie but good enough.",The Founder

149,andrewburgereviews,I am not lovin' it,7,7 September 2020,"It is tricky, to say the least, to make a movie in which the main protagonist is a jerk. But director John Lee Hancock hired ""The Wrestler"" writer Robert Siegel and told him to write him a script, mythologizing a natural jerk--McDonalds ""founder"" Ray Kroc (flamboyantly portrayed by Michael Keaton)--a model businessman, combining ambition, smarts and ruthlessness to create the most successful restaurant in history, not to mention one of the most recognizable and biggest brands of all time.So, on the foundation that Kroc more or less stole the McDonalds' brothers intellectual property, Siegel went to work and I have to applaud his effort not only on making Kroc hateful--this is easy--but also by pointing out the brothers' tunnel vision focus. They are, as the movie itself states, cliches, unrecognized geniuses who loved their job perhaps too much. So much so, that despite wanting to franchise their McDonalds place in San Bernardino, they had no interest in becoming rich--they entered the world of business, a ruthless, destructive, methodical and cruel world, without any business intents. Kroc was nothing more than one of the many wolves to greet them at the entrance.But while Kroc resists love from the viewer at any point, it is interesting to see that his war on the McDonalds' brothers started from necessity rather than greed. He was barely braking even, so they had it coming to them. I don't want this to seem like I am taking Kroc's side, no way. I am just saying, I am not surprised. He was a career businessman, listening to motivational speeches, always on the road as a struggling travelling salesman. He neglected his first wife, Ethel (Laura Dern) and he was, essentially, desperate.In a way, Kroc was a tunnel vision man as well. Except whereas the brothers' tunnel vision was unhealthy financially, for Kroc, it was unhealthy in his personal life. He was hellbent on McDonalds. He divorced Ethel simply because she couldn't bother supporting him and later re-married to Joan Smith (Linda Cardellini) who was by his side. His actions towards the McDonalds' brothers were not personal, just business. He truly loved McDonalds and was prepared to fight for it against everyone, even its very creators.This was obvious from the very first scene in which he gazed upon that restaurant in San Bernardino. He ordered a burger and fries which were, immediately given to him to his surprise. He ate on a bench, near a mother and two children. That new-found freedom left an impression on him--as the scene left an impression on me. That being said, it is also when I started to become concerned. I just asked myself when will the inevitable mythologizing begin. And it was only a matter of time before Siegel inundated the script with artful comparisons of McDonalds as America or, worse, McDonalds as the new church! These can contribute to the artistic, core value of the movie and can stern those with a political pulse. But ""The Founder"" is not essentially emotionally deep so, here, they came out as cliches.The movie definitely works in the sense that it pays the brother their well-deserved respect as genius underdogs by portraying them as paragons, heroes of the fast-food industry--which, again, they are. But it also painted a multi-pov facet of business and friendship, business and family and, business and evil. These are all present, if being on a superficial level--like the final scene between Richard McDonald (Nick Offerman) and Kroc in the bathroom after cutting a deal for Kroc to buy their original place. Many movies contain personal encounters between business enemies just after a deal is struck but here, it contains just more mythologizing but also a sneaky thank you from Ray to Richard as he claims he loves the name as he rhetorically asks: ""would you eat at a place called Kroc""?But the truth has a way of showing itself sooner or later and history will eventually be rewritten. In the very final scene of the movie, in which Ray Kroc--now a true business magnate--stands in front of the mirror practicing a speech he is to give at the White House has his arrogant smile wiped out for no apparent reason. Perhaps he was feeling guilt or maybe asking himself: how will history really remember me?",The Founder

However one might not like his ways and the level of compassion he had but it's definitely commendable. Literally, he bought the thing from the marvelous McDonald brother's who were too nice to thrive in the business industry.You just realise afterall the business industry is cut-throat. Take any name- Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg etc.. they all took the idea from someone else but they had one common thing in them- a business mind, a mind to sell and earn profit.The movie has a good pace and flow, covers just the important aspects that needs to be, for a biopic and a few good dialogues by Keaton.

Michael Keaton's portrayal of Ray Kroc, the (self-proclaimed) ""founder"" of McDonald's, is positively brilliant! Comparing his look and performance to the real Ray Kroc seen before the credits roll, there is no doubt that director John Lee Hancock (known for The Rookie and The Blind Side) made the right choice. ""The Founder"" takes us on a journey from Southern California to Illinois and beyond as we follow the course of events that radically revolutionized an entire industry and gave birth to one of the most recognized brands in the world as well as the very concept of modern franchising. What Henry Ford did for American motorcars, Kroc did for American ""speeedee"" service food. Ray Kroc realized the American dream by stopping at nothing until he built his empire, even if it meant stealing from a business and breaking up a marriage--all within the confines of the law. We've all heard about ""the American dream;"" well, The Founder depicts what it takes for that dream to come true. If you're willing to be a cut-throat bully with few if any inhibitions, then you can build an empire claim to be the founder of another's company or even run a country.Although the film is presently foundering in box offices, it is definitely worth a watch because of depicting the story of one man's American dream that would essentially steal the laurels from baseball and apple pie to become a larger than life symbol of America recognized throughout the world. It's unfortunate that this film is not garnering more attention because the writing, directing, and acting are absolutely brilliant. Full of irony and ambiguity, The Founder could have easily been called or at least subtitled ""Birth of a Salesman."" While watching the movie, I could not help but compare the plot of this film with the iconic play ""Death of a Salesman"" by Arthur Miller. Both tell stories of salesman but the end result is vastly different. Both Willy Loman and Ray Kroc were dedicated to their respective craft of salesmanship; however, Kroc took the practice of sales and pitches to the next level--in fact he created his own game in which only he could win. Where else have we seen a bully play by his own rules and build an empire into a brand in and of itself? I'll allow you to draw that conclusion. Further irony can be seen in Ray Kroc's surname. His sheer cunning, predatory ways of conducting business can easily be likened to the crocodile itself. Despite receiving credit for inventing the fast food assembly line, much like Ford did for American car manufacturers, the ""speedee"" service was invented by Dick and Mac McDonald of San Bernardino. Thankfully, the brothers are receiving the credit that they deserve--albeit posthumously.The cognitive dissonance that many will experience during diegesis of this film is fascinating in and of itself. Early on, you will find yourself rooting for Ray Kroc because he comes off as an underdog. He is able to provide decently for him and his wife, but it is evident that his business is in the process of collapsing. Even after striking the proverbial deal with the McDonald brothers, you may still root for him because the brothers make it difficult for Kroc to actually engage in successful franchising. The tide begins to subtly shift when the chain begins to take off. When the brothers deny Kroc a request to renegotiate the terms of the contract in order to boost capital and revenue, Kroc hires a new business partner who provides the knowhow to shift the focus from running a burger chain to being a real estate mogul. Interestingly, when confronted by the brothers on a break in the contract, Kroc points out that they could take him to court and probably win, but by the time he would drag them through hearing after hearing, and trial after trial, the brothers would be completely bankrupt. Much like the milkshake substitute that boosted revenue and mitigated refrigeration costs, but contained no milk, a handshake deal with Kroc is just as fake.Ray and Joan Kroc are well known philanthropists--in their later years. In fact, Joan Kroc left most of her vast fortune to many charities. The most well-known recipient of the inheritance is NPR. Even today, if you listen to the programming, you will hear the Estate of Joan Kroc mentioned as a supporter of the public radio organization. Whether you appreciate NPR or not, one cannot help but think that all the philanthropy of the Kroc (namely Joan) is a result of easing the conscience since the Kroc fortune can be likened to blood money. It's entirely plausible that much like Marion Crane figuratively cleanses her spirit in the infamous ""Psycho"" shower after having stolen the money from her employer, Joan may have very well given her fortune away in an effort to ease her conscience and do good with the figuratively ill-gotten money. If there is anything inspirational to take away from this film, it is the power of that persistence and looking for potential in the most unlikely of places.",The Founder
153,alanpgini,"Interesting, factual, but is it really Ray Kroc?",7,17 February 2017,"Good movie. There were only two historical inaccuracies that I saw, as they skipped the existence of Kroc's second wife, as well as the existence of his daughter. This story was carried by a great performance by Michael Keaton. But the question remains. Was Kroc really as a person, as performed by Keaton? Was Kroc a nice guy that turned into, well, a not so nice guy? The film tries to answer that from with two points. That being the use of a record called the power of positive thinking. As well as the justification of his later actions toward the original MacDonald brothers. The story's two morals are well evidenced at the end, as it tries to make a connection between the earlier and later Kroc, when at the end of the movie, he practices a speech in the mirror, using that same record. It tries to establish that old saw that you cant be a successful businessman, and a nice guy, at the same time. It also adds that old truism; That as in the case of the MacDonald brothers, that nice guys always finish last. This movie seems to have been a long time in coming. After all, there aren't too many people in the world, at least in industrialized nations, that haven't eaten McDonalds food. McDonalds changed the American physical landscape, unlike any other single entity in our nations history. Maybe even more than the interstate highways that established our now separated society. After all, how many miles can you go, without seeing signs for the golden arches? It changed our cultural landscape as well. Because it also separated us by removing us from our ethnic roots in our food. Only in the last ten years or so, are we beginning to get that back, as healthier eating, brings us back to those roots. But was the man played by Keaton, really a correct approximation of Ray Kroc? The production value and story were very good. But I didn't rate it higher, because it didn't answer that question to my satisfaction.",The Founder

So I will give The Founder an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and I will say The Founder is worth seeing if you want to see how McDonald's became the big fast food franchise it is today and if you like films based on true stories and on real life people that did incredible things to make the world a better place all those years ago. So if you get the chance to see The Founder in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.",The Founder
155,kingbk-2,The True Story of McDonald's,8,5 February 2017,"As I've gotten older, I've eaten less and less fast food. If I ever decide to indulge, usually it's In-N- Out Burger, Chick-Fil-A , Arby's and Wendy's. I haven't gone to McDonald's in years, mainly because I think the quality is low for the price. Though fast food still plays a huge part in our world, health concerns, the environmental impact, the homogenization, low wages and more have darkened some of the feelings we had at one point for the food. The Founder tells the story, the true story, of how McDonald's was founded and how it exploded into the giant that it is today.Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton, in another wonderful performance) is a 52-year-old milkshake machine salesman living in the Chicago suburbs in 1954. Kroc isn't poor by any means and seems to have a pretty comfortable life, but while others his age are starting to think retirement, he's thinking his next business idea. Going town to town unsuccessfully selling the machines, he starts getting tired of the grind. Drive-ins, with their long waits and loud surroundings infested by teenagers, are starting to get on his nerves. Things change when he gets an unusually large order of 8 milkshake machines from a diner in San Bernardino called McDonald's. Curious, he takes Route 66 from Chicago to California to see their restaurant in person. There, he's amazed by what he sees: a fast restaurant with a small menu making high quality food. No utensils, no plates. No carhops, no tables, with mostly families as the clientele. Intrigued, he meets with the owners, Dick and Mac McDonald (Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch). Taking them out to dinner, they tell Kroc of their journey westward: natives of New Hampshire, they moved to California to chase their dreams of being in the movies. However, the depression hit shortly afterwards, so they had to think of another way to make money. They started with a hot dog stand in Arcadia, a small town outside of L.A. Afterwards, they moved to San Bernardino and opened a drive-in. Business started to stall, so the brothers tweaked the concept. They dropped the menu to just a few key items (hamburgers, cheeseburgers, french fries, soda and milkshakes), they removed the carhops, and created a system that would make the food hot, fast and of high quality. Thus, McDonald's was born in 1940. Kroc, excited about this concept, convinces the brothers to let him be in charge of franchising it out across the country. The brothers agree, but are very strict about how they want the restaurants to operate. Kroc wants to partner with Coca-Cola, which the brothers see as crass commercialism and decline. Kroc, to cut operating costs, wants to switch to powdered base milkshakes, which again, the brothers decline, saying it would cut down on quality. The battle between the two parties grows ugly, to the point where Kroc starts revising the history of McDonald's to say it was founded by him in Des Plaines, Illinois in 1955, when really that was the first location he opened. More and more, he undermines the brothers and cuts them out of the business. Eventually, they sell him the business, but what transpires is gross and really makes Kroc look like a thief, a leach and pretty much a scumbag. I love learning how businesses are formed. Many times, it's not neat and tidy, and people are hurt. We saw that in The Social Network, and we see that in The Founder. The McDonald brothers wanted nothing more than a comfortable life, Kroc, however, wanted much more. So from the get go the relationship was strained. Many might look at Kroc and say he was the visionary who made McDonald's the giant it is today. Others will look at him and say he's a fraud, a man who stole an idea and exploited two well meaning owners, eventually cutting them out of the money they deserved. I'm leaning toward the latter, but also understand the former. The McDonald brothers didn't really care if the company became a global phenomenon. They likely would have been content just keeping their original location humming. A part of me wonders what would have happened if they just said no from the beginning. Would fast food be more of a local thing? Would drive-ins still be popular? Would we be a healthier society? I don't know.This movie doesn't even touch many of the ideas that would launch McDonald's into the stratosphere: the creation of the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets, the breakfast menu, Ronald McDonald or the Happy Meal. What it does is tell us the story of who really founded McDonald's. Two brothers did in Southern California, but a man in the Chicago area grew it to unforeseen levels. Is he a visionary or a thief? That's up to you to decide after watching The Founder.",The Founder
156,derekjager,Too long and kinda boring,4,20 February 2017,"I was surprised how ""bland"" this film was since the true story is filled with a real ""bad guy"" and the loss of innocence as portrayed by the McDonald's brothers.And it starts out okay---Kroc seems like a nice guy, looking for something to sell, really sell. And he meets the McDonald brothers and builds a relationship with them.But from then on, the film just seems to wander aimlessly with no narrative thrust or energy. And since not much goes on, I wonder why the film was so long. The last 30 minutes are just a snooze fest. And then it's over.A real disappointment.",The Founder
157,bobzmcishl,The Founder or the Founders,7,25 August 2017,"The Founder is a business story about three people, Ray Kroc, and the two McDonalds brothers. The movie addresses the controversy over who really founded the iconic multi-national corporation we see all around us and which has shaped how we eat today. Since the movie is mostly told from the viewpoint of Ray Kroc, the title of the movie answers the question of who founded McDonalds. Michael Keaton as Ray Kroc makes this movie. He is shown in midlife still trying to sell multi- mixer milkshake makers to drive-in-owners who don't do enough business to justify them. His ""build it and they will come"" pitch doesn't fly with these hard nosed businessmen. As Kroc orders a meal at one of these drive-inn's you can see why their days are numbered, which is recounted later when Kroc finally meets the McDonald brothers who are doing a landslide business selling only four items, burgers, fries, soda pop, and milkshakes. The quality is good and the prices are low. No carhops and elaborate places to park. You walk up and order and your food is delivered promptly and in a paper bag. Kroc quickly realizes no one else has duplicated this fast food formula and that it can be emulated on a massive scale nationwide through franchising. He convinces the skeptical McDonald brothers to let him try even though they told him they tried it and it failed because they could not guarantee consistent quality once you go the expansion route. Kroc signs a contract with them and proceeds to hire go-getters like himself to become franchisees. Through trial and error, he finally achieves massive success, sheds his first wife and marries a go-getter like himself who he met while eating dinner at an upscale restaurant. The McDonald brothers at this point are not happy with Kroc. They see him as compromising their brand. After all their name is still on the chain. Kroc forces them to renegotiate the contract and he buys them out, part of which includes a handshake agreement. Kroc of course, snookered the McDonalds, and soon they were history. End of story except for actual video of the real Ray Kroc telling part of this story at the end credits.I would have liked the story better had it been filmed on location. I lived only two blocks from the original McDonalds at 14th and E Streets in San Bernardino. It was obvious from the foliage that the San Bernardio scenes were shot somewhere back east. They didn't even try to make it look like the semi-arid area where San Bernardino is. Also the maps of that era would not have shown Moreno Valley or Irvine. Those cities did not exist back then. The quality of the burgers and shakes at the original McDonalds were much higher than what you get today when you walk into a McDonalds. They made real milkshakes back then. I was in the Air Force at the time and the prices were made for my pocketbook. Today I rarely go to McDonalds. I much prefer In-N- Out which has the same quality that the original McDonalds had. The movie does address the confusion over which was the original McDonalds. Kroc wanted to eliminate the history of the McDonald brothers and their original location. As far as Kroc was concerned McDonald's was born in DesPlaines Illinois where the fake #1 McDonalds is located. The Founder is an American dream success story - Willy Loman makes it big time, and a small scale tragedy in that the McDonald brothers who created the magic fast food formula only enjoyed limited success. That of course is the power of this story and coupled with the excellent cast makes for good story telling. At the end of the movie Ray Kroc tells Dick McDonald the reason he really wanted to buy McDonalds and that is interesting in of itself.",The Founder
158,longcooljolie,Brilliant origin story and morality tale and totally engrossing,8,7 January 2020,"This biopic movie interests me greatly, and I have already watched it multiple times. There are many great reviews on IMDB that cover the story and the themes much better than I can here, so I'll concentrate on the little things that make this movie so enjoyable and offer some other perspectives.The art direction and cinematic style for the first act of the movie, which takes place in 1950s California and Illinois, makes a great hook as there is lots of period detail and a languid musical score that fits in well with the more innocent, slower pace of that time period. Dick and Mac McDonald tell Ray Kroc about their restaurant over dinner and the flashbacks are told partially through dissolving slides, which was a very pleasing technique. Then there is the recreation of how the brothers designed their restaurant using a tennis court and chalk,The middle act gets into the nitty-gritty about how Ray pushed ahead with his franchises in multiple states and infuriated the brothers at various turns. Here, there is a wonderful scene where Ray is taken with a blond woman playing piano at a restaurant social function, and she turns out to be Joan, who was married to another man at the time. Joan's husband introduces her to Ray and they end up playing a duet of ""Pennies from Heaven"" on the piano together. This added levity to the story and also added another dimension to Ray's character. Plus they sang and played well together, which was a delight to see.The final act of the film concerns Ray further growing the McDonald's empire and what becomes of the brothers, who were the real, original ""founders."" This is the part of the story most people are more familiar with as everyone has witnessed the huge growth of McDonald's to some degree. The makers of the film wisely veered away from scenes showing how McDonald's further dominated the world and popular culture, which is rife with content about how fast food has negatively impacted worldwide health (Fast Food Nation; Supersize Me).Instead, the movie ends with a long speech from Ray, or more technically a rehearsal for a speech in his bedroom and then his wife Joan comes to collect him to bring him to the event. Again, it was a good way to end and in a way it neatly ties up Ray's story. After all, the movie is about Ray Kroc first and McDonald's second but it is 100 percent enjoyable, engrossing, and worthwhile.",The Founder
159,ReelLifeReviews,Michael Keaton carries it on his back,7,12 February 2017,"This isn't a love letter to McDonald's, that's for sure. I was curious if there would be any sugarcoating, but they went right for the nitty- gritty. I felt like a guilty fly on the wall as I watched this guy devour the business. I'm loving Michael Keaton's recent resurgence, and this was another great opportunity for him to shine. He absolutely carried the movie on his back, as the supporting cast isn't all that strong . The middle of the movie did feel a bit like a treadmill, losing the momentum it had been gaining. It could have been pared down to match the pacing of the rest of the film. You'll never look at McDonald's the same way again after seeing this. But that still didn't stop me from picking up some McNuggets in the way home. 7.5/10",The Founder

It was hurtful seeing the McDonald's brothers suffer through this franchising business, and the lengths Ray goes through to turn McDonald's into a franchise is nothing short of cruel and awful. If this film was supposed to make us feel sympathy for Ray when he fails, then it failed spectacularly. It instead succeeds in making us feel bad for the McDonald's bros when they get the short end of the stick.

163,JontheLobsterLover,McFuriating,8,3 February 2017,"If you are a fan of McDonalds, there is a chance that this film will change your view of the fast-food chain. I wouldn't say I was a fan of McDonalds before watching this film, but I wouldn't say I was Anti-McDonalds either. After watching it I can say I found myself cursing the fast food chain. When I went back for a second viewing I tried to keep an open mind; I kept telling myself that there are two sides to every story. I thought that during my second viewing I would be able to see a different perspective, and fully understand exactly what took place, but my feelings on the subject matter remain unchanged.Even though the film is mostly one sided, showing the McDonalds brothers in the victim's spotlight, I would love to learn more about Ray's side. Ray Croc's tactics, personality, and overall selfishness was infuriating, but to play devil's advocate, he was excellent at what he did. Throughout the film, you will hear the term ""persistence"" often, and Ray is definitely the poster boy for the word. Casting Michael Keaton as Ray was a smart move. He doesn't have the warm, charming face that Ray seems to have; however, the sharpness of his expressions and his attitude conveyed the underlying feeling of who Ray was. The portrayal of the McDonald brothers was my favorite thing about the film. More particularly, I thought Nick Offerman shined in his role as Richard McDonald. He took a chance and strayed from comedy, retired his mustache, and showed us all that he can pull off serious rolls as well. The film sticks with the early days of the company, staying away from the more modern things (1960s and on). It's less about the what the chain eventually became, and more about how it came to be. The film matter is infuriating, but it's also an amazing biopic. Whether we like McDonalds or not, it's a piece of American history, and this is one history lesson I don't think anyone will forget.",The Founder

Nick Offerman and John Carrol Lynch complete the flick's main triangle and the three have such good performances, really making for a compelling arch.

Nevertheless, its a solid feature, and one that I was eager to see for the last month or so. It didn't disappoint me, but, on the other hand, it didn't really surprise me, aside from some shining moments sprinkled throughout, but I'm afraid that in few weeks I won't remember anything of it.

165,Ben_Cap,The Real Story of a Real Jerk,6,21 January 2017,"McDonald's has been one of if not the most influential brands in the world. It has been a staple of not only American fast food but American life, whether you like like it or not. Going into The Founder I did not know a lot Ray Kroc, other than that he was in some way involved with the mega chain. Turns out Kroc is a real piece of work, and while there were things about this story that interested me, overall what we get is the tale of an asshole and how he succeeded in screwing some people out of a lot of money. This is where the movie runs into its main problem, half the time it feels like praying at the alter of Kroc, and the other half feels like a pulled punch to the gut of ultra-capitalists.The first act tells about Kroc struggling as a milkshake mixer salesman, when he discovers a restaurant unlike any of the others that he has visited. The speed of service, the consistency of the quality of the food and the way it brought the community together draws Kroc to the burger shack known as McDonald's. The rest of the movie plays out with Kroc slowly bleeding the McDonald brothers of their company and really the original intention of the restaurant. Kroc did implement some innovations that pushed McDonald's into a worldwide franchise, but these moments mostly come after the events of the movie. The innovative ideas that we do see are almost exclusively created by the McDonald brothers, who as previously stated basically get screwed the whole movie.Michael Keaton is probably looking right back at you from both sides of the screen right now, so you have probably figured out he plays an important role here. Keaton plays it with his normal light comedy tone, which would work perfectly if the movie had embraced it more. I have no idea what Ray Kroc is like so I really don't know if he was anything like Keaton's performance, but darn it if he is not enjoyable to watch. When Kroc begins his descent into jerk off Keaton is professional enough to pull off the switch in character just enough to keep the original idea of him intact. For the most part everyone else just pops in and out. Nick Offerman and John Carrol Lynch play the McDonald brothers who come and go quite regularly, again mostly getting screwed. Poor Laura Dern plays Kroc's first wife, who is relegated to the bummer at home. She never gets to be anything but disappointing which in turn, is disappointing.The McDonald brothers main concern for franchising their restaurant, which had taken them years to perfect just the way they wanted it was that the quality of the food would suffer and thus the name would suffer. Now some 60 odd years later it is funny to think about how that is exactly what happened, and there in lies the main problem with The Founder. There is no critical look at the moves Kroc made. They don't fully back his decisions, but they also don't condemn them. This movie needed a side to take, with it stuck in the middle the story becomes so much less than it could have been. It's like if The Big Short did not make up its mind when it comes to the bankers that caused the financial meltdown.My final thoughts on the movie are pretty simple, there is an interesting story here, where in some ways the world was changed for the better, and some for the worse. I just don't believe it was told in the right way, and while not an incredibly important tale was one that was not difficult to sit through. at an hour and 55 minute run time, The Founder just sneaks under the magic 2 hour mark, but honestly could have been about 15 minutes shorter. There was something here, but with the tone of the movie stuck on the fence, The Founder is pretty forgettable.",The Founder
166,madbeast,No Dramatic Payoff,3,6 May 2017,"While the story of The Founder is beautifully executed and uniformly well-acted (especially by Michael Keaton, Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch), I found it to be uniquely dramatically unsatisfying. It tells the Machiavellian story of Ray Kroc, the man who wormed his way into the McDonald brothers' inventive means of improving the way fast food is prepared and served, and gradually forced them out because he grew frustrated at following the terms he agreed to in order to become part of their vision.It begins as an interesting story to see unfold because of the massive importance to society that McDonalds finally became, but ultimately the interest wears thin because there is no character growth or dramatic themes that are explored through the telling of it. Kroc is simply an ambitious nobody with no real ideas of his own who leeches onto the McDonald brothers and then forces them out because he wants to be the guy in charge (even the scheme that allows him to take over the business comes from someone else). True, McDonalds wouldn't be the massive corporation it is today without Kroc's brutal ambitions behind it, but other than that there is no dramatic payoff to his scheming. He is not a charismatic monster like Shakespeare's Richard III nor is he left emotionally empty at the terrible things he's done like Michael Corleone in The Godather. He's just a jerk who wants to get rich no matter who he has to bulldoze over to do it, and does. The filmmakers might have done better to tell the story from the point of view of the McDonald brothers, who are far more sympathetic and interesting characters. Instead, they chose to make their hero a vile, ruthless man who is thoroughly unlikable.If you want to check out The Founder because you're interested in the historic rise of an important American corporation, by all means do. But if you're looking for a piece of drama that will make you think about themes that you can take with you through life, I'd say give it a pass.",The Founder

It seems he totally exploited the MacDonald brothers and pretty much stole their business out from under them. So Kroc really doesn't come off as visionary more like a predator. Even when he has the opportunity to redeem himself with the brothers, he doesn't.Kroc spends most of his time exploiting the American Dream, stepping over the people closest to him, and then leaving them in the trash heap.

168,joshteggert,"'The Founder' is an interesting blend of subtlety and melodrama, with an appetite for entertainment.",6,13 February 2017,"Another stepping-stone in Michael Keaton's Hollywood resurrection, 'The Founder' can be truly intriguing at points but ultimately rides too hard on Keaton's engaging performance as Ray Kroc, the supposed founder of the iconic McDonald's restaurant chain. Focussing exclusively on Kroc's battle with the McDonald brothers, Dick (Nick Offerman) and Mac (John Carroll Lynch), to ""franchise the whole damn thing"", yet also skipping over personal issues he faced, it's hard not to feel like the film doesn't quite know what sort of approach it wants to make.'The Founder' provokes many emotions throughout its 1 hour 55 minute run-time that one would not have expected prior to viewing, swaying opinions on Kroc as quickly as the fast food process that the McDonald's system instigated. This can be quite poignant; it is impressive for a movie about the founding of a business to be this compelling, as usually these kinds of films can focus very much on the dramatic thrill, whereas 'The Founder' exhibits an enthusiastic buzz about it that makes it fun to follow.The plot is untidy however. Written by Robert Siegel, moments of importance are slow to develop and then splashed occasionally with under-developed spontaneity to drive the story through the complications. Furthermore, it feels like Director John Lee Hancock relies heavily on Keaton's magnetism when on screen to brush these details aside and force us to be entranced once again in the sly attributes of Ray Kroc. In spite of that, this is also the film's greatest subtlety. 'The Founder' comprehensively explores how Ray Kroc elaborated on the efficient system designed by the McDonald brothers in their California branch, which had been running for 14 years before collaborating with Kroc. Hancock cleverly illustrates the brothers as sideliners to their own success, acutely demonstrating the self-determination and drive of Kroc and his impenetrable ambition to make McDonald's a national success.Although, it does seem as though the film focuses on certain less interesting concepts at the expense of other potentially more entrancing points, such as the love affair between Kroc and Joan Smith (Linda Cardellini), who would eventually go on to be married for 15 years until Ray's death in 1984. In the film, which also takes certain liberties from the historical events, this is barely touched on, only implied at through the difficulties of Kroc's former marriage with Ethel Kroc (Laura Dern), not to mention completely disregarding Ray's 5-year marriage to Jane Dobbins after divorcing Ethel. Exploring these aspects further would have aided the film in aptly demonstrating Kroc's character in the depth it seems to want to go into. Instead, it leaves many points to linger in the open, and eases back into the process of empire building.For a film about the brutality of business, 'The Founder' feels rather tame. However, it is a coherent and thorough insight into the life of Ray Kroc and the harsh reality of capitalism, and wholly entertaining.",The Founder

Novak) who helped the drowning Kroc reverse his financial fortune and expand his global, fast food enterprise. Michael Keaton (Ray Kroc) has capitalized on the Hollywood goodwill garnered from his Oscar nominated performance in ""Birdman"" and ably gives a hard edged interpretation of the down on his luck, milkshake machine salesman who by chance met two brothers, Dick and Mac McDonald (Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch) who openly shared their original business model for selling fast, quality controlled, hamburgers at their McDonald's hamburger stand in San Berardino.

From the first act of course it going to be how McDonlds was going to be found; but after the first act, things starts to become intresting. Ray starts to cheat the McDonald brothers (both played by Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch) from what they sign their agreement upon, because Ray believes that persistence is the key and with that development between Ray and the McDonald brothers, I found it to be pretty interest. Now I wouldn't say that I want to relate to Ray Kroc's characther, because it is true that you need something in order to gain successful life, but I wouldn't recommend to be a cold hearted and greedy. The McDonald brothers are the character I felt relatable to the most, they both have different personality and both have their own debat about how they wanted McDonalds to succeed.One downside I though the movie could have worked on is the relationship with Ray Kroc's wife (Laura Dern),to me I felt like she was side character of the movie and I know that Ray did had a wife, but I feel like she can add more scene with Ray, because the whole movie you see how he becomes successful with McDonalds and he's leaving everything else behind.

They pretty much all do a fine job. That being said, the story, while modestly intriguing, is a bit of a snore. The brief and shallow delve into the lives of the McDonald brothers proves one of the more interesting aspects of the film, yet it by no means is their story. It's Ray Kroc's. Frankly, he's just not that interesting. I didn't find myself rooting for Kroc, actually, as the movie progresses, I found myself disliking him more and more. And he doesn't start out winning you over, so it's not a drop from a high place. As well, one may find themselves feeling a lot of compassion, even feeling a bit sorry for, the brothers McDonald. I will not give a spoiler in this review. Mainly because there's nothing to spoil. A read on Wikipedia is basically the script of the movie. There are no revelations here, and i was actually kind of surprised how much I knew about this story WITHOUT even researching it. It's that well-known. Is it a movie I would recommend? Yes, if only for the period costumes and feel of the movie. That was the true star of this thing. That was done with an expertise that is Oscar worthy. The original restaurant's look is amazingly recreated, and the art department is just plain top notch. So, what does it say when the most glowing part of a review is about a film's costumers, set pieces, and period ambiance? Probably that you should miss this one until it comes on cable or Netflix.And if you notice that I did not specifically review Keaton's or Dern's acting, it's because I like them both very much, and I'm certain they will be in something soon that I can rave about.

I have in fact delved into the whole history of fast food on my own, so when this film appeared on my radar I just had to have a look.I wasn't disappointed. Keaton, Offerman and everyone really do a fantastic job. The script is ten stars, not for historical accuracy but for great screenwriting.The direction? Meh. I didn't care for some of the camera movement and TV-style jump cutting and 'shakycam' but the material didn't leave too much creative leeeway.The exposition of the relationship between the hapless brothers McDonald and Kroc is very well done. See, the problem was exactly what Keaton's character said - that the brothers were very stubborn and sort of naive. Having literally started a nationwide expansion, the brothers did not realize that some small flexibility in physical design and other minor details had to be factored in. The whole 'powdered milk shake' story was made up. In fact, that did not happen until after the sale and eventually McD's went back to regular ice cream because it tasted like a powdered milkshake. I'm lovin' it! But this license is more than forgivable as it is futher exposition of the differences between the parties.If you head over to youtube you'll see that this movie sparked a lot of discussion about business tactics, stubborness in negotiation and a whole lot of Ray Kroc bios. The ""handshake deal"", as anyone in law or business knows, is as good as the paper it's written on. As in, not. So you don't really feel bad for the brothers when that goes down. You don't feel bad for Kroc either. He saw the genius of the system and service that the brothers had worked out, and as he says in the film, ""I knew I had to have it.

186,funnygy,"A uniquely American ""success"" story",8,28 January 2017,"One thing that never fails to fascinate me is learning how small ideas become big ones. The stray thought of a writer that inspires a bestselling novel. The chance meeting between two young musicians that ultimately spawns gold records and sold-out tours. The ""a-ha!"" moment that turns a seemingly impossible dream into reality. One such story is the story depicted in this film. In 1954, Ray Kroc was a struggling restaurant- supply salesman peddling a machine that could make up to five milkshakes at once. Kroc became curious when a small restaurant in southern California placed an order for six of the machines – what kind of business needed to produce 30 milkshakes at once? Intrigued, Kroc paid a visit to the restaurant, an innovative yet unassuming hamburger stand named after its owners, the brothers McDonald. The rest, as they say, is history. ""The Founder"" gives us the meat (pardon the pun) of the McDonald's story, posing some thought-provoking questions along the way. Is success measured merely by a profit margin or the pride and effort a man puts into his work? The film pulls us in different directions, casting differing lights on that question as the story unfolds. In the first half, we want to root for Kroc, the scrappy but hapless salesman who dreams of a better life for himself and his long-suffering wife. We admire his drive as he pushes those around him to understand what makes a McDonald's restaurant different, and at the same time tries to convince the McDonald brothers that their well-intentioned but snail-paced attention to detail is actually holding them back. But by the second half, we realize that we have witnessed the creation of a monster, as do the brothers when they discover that Kroc has essentially stolen their name even as he made it a household name. The key to ""The Founder"" is Michael Keaton's terrific performance as Ray Kroc, the shake- machine salesman who gradually becomes more of a snake-oil salesman. Yet as the credits roll, the viewer looks back to the beginning of the film and realizes that Keaton was hinting at it all along. In the title role, Keaton is not so much a wolf in sheep's clothing as a sheep who can become a wolf given the right opportunity. The killing blow comes at the very end, when a series of title cards reveals what ultimately became of the people depicted in the film in real life. It's unnerving to say the least, and may even change one's perspective on the entire story. Credit must also be extended to Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch, who play Dick and Mac McDonald, respectively. These actors manage to flesh out two supporting but essential characters. In less capable hands, these roles may have been relegated to mere footnotes in the story, as the real McDonald brothers ultimately became. To be clear, ""The Founder"" is not a perfect film by any means. The narrative particularly loses steam when we are introduced to Joan Smith, the ambitious, energetic young woman who will ultimately become Kroc's wife. While it's still an important part of the story, it feels shoehorned in, as if screenwriter Robert D. Siegel left it out of an earlier draft and then scrambled to write it back in later. But for all its faults, ""The Founder"" is still a very good film that tells a uniquely American story. It's recipe, if you will, blends one part Horatio Alger with a dash of Norman Rockwell and a good measure of Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" mixed in. And despite the fact that it necessarily contains a massive amount of product placement, you won't feel hungry for burgers or fries by the time it's done.",The Founder
187,SteveJ_888,What is it really about?,9,3 January 2018,"This is the story of Ray Kroc, the man behind the success of McDonalds. Or is it?I don't know how accurately Ray Kroc is portrayed in the movie, or how factual it is. It's based on a true story, but is not a documentary. A filmmaker's goal is to make an entertaining and profitable movie. Whatever literal truth comes out is a bonus, but a deeper truth is what counts. Founder highly succeeds on this level. It is engaging, entertaining, and sharply portrays a person that is both fascinating and scary. It would benefit anyone to be able to recognize this type of person when they are encountered.The movie is beautifully clear and unsentimental. The story is presented in a straight-forward way rarely seen in movies today, and it's a breath of fresh air. There are no fancy transitions, flashbacks, or time shifts, and there is no dramatic music. The movie is full of visual appeal, bright and attractive. The designs of the buildings, cars, and costumes are fantastic, including the exteriors and inner workings of the McDonalds restaurants. The dialog and action are both uncomplicated, and there is no mumbling and very little beneath the surface.There was one piece of visual symbolism that is artfully done. Look for it in the scene where Ray Kroc is speaking on the phone, seen through the window panes of his door. I would guess there are more moments like this. It's a movie I'll watch again, so I'll look for them.The acting is strong throughout, for parts large and small. Many of the small parts add a great deal. I can't remember a single event or bit of dialog that wasn't believable. The movie is joyful and polite, like movies used to be, but never phony or insipid. There is a complete absence of melodrama.I had a free pass and no expectations so the movie was a pleasant surprise. It was absorbing from beginning to end. A chatty audience wouldn't settle down at the beginning, and people were shushing and yelling ""Quiet, quiet!"" The noise didn't last long, though, and there wasn't a peep until after the movie finished. Then a woman loudly exclaimed, ""What a bastard!""I am not going to judge Ray Kroc based on this movie, or assume that I learned the true story of McDonalds. It has inspired me to search for books and documentaries on the subject.The truth of the movie is beyond question. There are people among us who are charming, passionate, likable, driven to succeed, and inspiring, and yet worthy of contempt.A small amount of well-placed voice-over in the movie breaks it down. Success doesn't depend on talent or education. ""The world is full of educated fools."" Determination is key.But does material success sometimes (often?) come at a price? Does it require the sale of your soul? The Ray Kroc in Founder is a down-to-earth, tirelessly hardworking man who will not accept defeat. He values excellence. But he is also a man who will look you in the eye and make a promise he has no intention of keeping. He is a man who wouldn't bother to stab you in the back if it would serve him equally to stab you in the front.

188,Fiurilli,The rise of Ray Kroc,6,13 January 2017,"Batman, Birdman or, as he's more commonly called, Michael Keaton is back on the big screen. This time the Bat steps into the shoes of a mister Ray Kroc, the protagonist in 'The Founder' directed by John lee Hancock. The movie has us follow a Ray Kroc who went from being a fairly unsuccessful salesman to becoming the owner of the largest restaurant chain in the entire world called McDonald's. The story of 'The Founder', written by Robert D. Siegel, is very linear in its structure. It starts out with Ray Kroc at his lowest trying to sell milkshake mixers to drive in burger shops across America and takes off from there. From there on out the movie never makes any interesting twist and turns and slowly progresses until it meets its conclusion. Going into this movie one should not be expecting a film with a lot intriguing elements and it ultimately conveys no message whatsoever. Following Ray Kroc in his journey was still a very fun experience mostly because MacDonald's origins were fairly unknown to me at the time. There are some attempts to liven up the story, such as Kroc's relationship with his wife, but most feel shoehorned in and aren't given enough time to fully develop. If one were to watch this film a second time its story will hardly be as interesting and I really see no reason why one would.John Lee Hancock's directional style also leaves much to be desired. Now it isn't necessarily bad, but the problem with it is that for the most past it just feels flavourless. There are hardly any scenes or shots that stand out aside from a minor few also used in promotional material. Ultimately this movie could have been directed by almost any no name director and it most probably would not have changed anything. One thing that does make 'The Founder' stand out amongst the crowd is the great acting from Michael Keaton. The persona of Ray Kroc seems to fit Keaton like a glove and the unique mannerisms and quirks he brings to the character make his performance incredibly fun to watch. The other actors also put in a considerable effort, especially John Carroll Lynch and Nick Offerman as Mac and Dick McDonald. Not a single actor comes close to Keaton however and completely manage to create the sense that they are actually living in this world.In the end 'The Founder' is a very bland movie. The story of Ray Kroc is interesting enough to make it worth the watch but without the superb acting from Michael Keaton this would have been a simple throwaway movie.My rating: 6/10",The Founder
189,Jared9001,"A decent biopic with an interesting premise and characters, but flawed pacing.",6,22 June 2017,"Going into ""The Founder"", I was really looking forward to watching it: the idea of telling a biographical story of the start of the worlds most notorious fast-food giant was extremely appealing. And for the most part, I got what I wanted. The story is about traveling salesman Roy Kroc (Michael Keaton), who is always out looking to make himself famous and revered for the ""next big thing"", studying the art of persistence. Through his travels in selling, he finds Mac (John Carroll Lynch) and Dick (Nick Offerman) McDonald, two brothers in California who have created a revolutionary system of serving high quality food to customers very quickly. Kroc partners with them, and begins franchising out the rights to the restaurants. Over time, however, Kroc and the McDonald's begin to have feel a lot of strain on their relationship, with Kroc's insatiable hunger for control and power making the relationship fairly toxic, until eventually, he completely screws the brothers out of the institution they created. The parts of the story that focus on the relationship between Kroc and the McDonald's are the strongest elements of this film, with Nick Offerman's performance being the standout. The relationship between the brothers is very interesting to watch, and the sympathetic eye the movie puts them in isn't overdone and really does help the viewer form a connection with the two. Michael Keaton's performance as Roy Kroc is also excellent, and all the nuances of this selfish, power hungry man are really felt through his acting, you really feel as if he's mastered this character. However, where this movie falls apart for me is the way it's paced and how it handles all the characters that aren't the McDonald's and Kroc. When the movie begins, it's relatively fast paced, showcasing Kroc's struggle to sell this one particular milkshake mixer to different drive-ins across the Midwest, him discovering the McDonald's, driving out to meet them, and the McDonald's telling him their story of how they created the restaurant, leading up to him becoming a partner in the company. All of this happens in less than 45 minutes, and after that, everything just seems to really crawl. The entirety of the McDonald's creating their company is told through narration and flashbacks with the character's just sitting at a table and talking, and suffers from too much telling and not enough showing. After that point, various rich white guys in suits are introduced as footnotes, and then rarely mentioned again, with their characters never having much weight to the ultimate story being told. No joke, at the end of the movie there's pictures and text showing where all the people ended up in real life, and I barely knew who most of them were, because they were introduced once or twice and then just kind of hung in the background for the rest of the film. The relationship between Kroc and his wife doesn't do anything new, and doesn't add very much to the impression of his character at all, and uses time that could've been spent on other characters.This movie honestly just needed some tightening up. There's a lot about it to praise- all of the acting in this movie is actually pretty good, and the shots are perfectly suitable (albeit pretty standard_ for this kind of film- it just needs some tightening up to really push it into that higher quality territory. 6.8/10",The Founder

So we should thank Ray for expanding to this level the largest fast food line in the world, however Ray Crok is in the minor leagues of selfish and twisted characters, compared to Jordan Belfort, Gordon Gekko, or his greatest analogue; Mark Zuckerberg.If the film was not so interested in staying under the shadow of the great films of this genre and if i had tried to find its own vision, it would have triumphed much more, unfortunately John Lee Hancock directs conventionally and Robert Siegel writes a rather dysfunctional and full of cliches script.The final scene is the biggest demonstration of Crok's cruelty, he is preparing a speech in which he will fool an entire country and seems to be very calm, repeats self-help phrases and is with his new wife, who took it from one of his partners, in these few minutes Ray becomes a memorable character, if the film had portrayed Ray Crok in this way throughout history the result would have been more interesting.",The Founder

As a leading actor in his latest roles, including The Founder, and starting with Birdman, he entered the League of the Greatest American Actors. His acting in The Founder is powerful and enjoyable. Although being a negative figure, creates sympathy in a world of wolves. The film is about him, and his fantastic performance. The film in itself is less poignant but presents the Golden Years of America and the first years of a success story. I saw Michael Keaton for the first time in Batman and then in another less important films but he has matured and became someone who outperforms former Giants of Acting , the likes of Pacino or De Niro, of course around a decade younger than them. The Founder is a good film in general having its flaws. I hope Michael Keaton will follow in his further career what he said in the film: ""Persistence is the most important thing when building a career and pursuing success"". He really deserves the highest possible awards.",The Founder

197,showmethemoviescontact,The Founder ShowMeTheMovies Review,6,10 March 2017,"Despite high quality performances among seasoned acting veterans, The Founder is a missed opportunity in biographical cinema.The Founder is a movie which tells a story of the creation of the McDonald's restaurant chain and how it came to be, following Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) and his acquisition of the brand from the McDonald brothers (John Carroll Lynch & Nick Offerman).What this movie holds to its' advantage is that the portrayals of the main characters do not water down their personalities, Ray Kroc is shown to be opportunistic and devious without apology; Dick McDonald is calculating and uptight, and Mac McDonald is conveyed as too forgiving. The screenplay for these characters played to the actor's talents; Nick Offerman was particularly entertaining in his role, but the main cast's performances could not save this semi-biographical script.The movie has some interesting cinematography, one particular scene has the McDonald brothers explaining the creation of their restaurant, with cutaway shots going through the events being explained whilst simultaneously being described by the brothers; not to mention that they finish off each other's sentences in a slick manner. All of this adds to an alluring start, but really its' all just style over substance.Besides the atypical camera-work and skillful performances, The Founder does not have much left to offer. The way the story flows is far from perfect, focussing on Kroc much more than necessary which pushed aside the credible supporting cast, which could have likely told a more accurate plot with greater inclusion of the McDonald brothers.The movie suffers from being in the middle ground, not taking enough risks to be credible as a great movie, but playing it safe enough so that the film isn't terrible either. There is not much that can even be said about The Founder other than that it has interesting moments and good acting, but I could never say that I didn't find my attention wavering during the picture.The trailer of the movie does give away most of the important events during the film, I left the cinema getting exactly what I expected; a mediocre-to-good biopic with decent costume design for the era, and not a great focus on attention to detail or actually making the film more interesting than the bare minimum.If I was asked if I could recommend this film, I would only be able to do so if you're interested in biographical movies as a whole; the movie does project the characters in a realistic light but the story that they are placed in is far from perfect or interesting.The Founder hired the right people for the acting jobs, but from the man who directed acclaimed biographical drama The Blind Side, this could have been much more than just a vanilla motion picture.https://showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/2017/03/review-founder.html",The Founder

Likewise, I won't dote upon the set and costume design, or even the performances of the actors. They were all fine and served the needs of the finished product.I want to get right to the point that this film seems to ask: what side are you on?""The Founder"" is a parable of business that pitches the forces of creation versus the effects of distribution. The McDonald brothers were frustrated businessmen who, in what could be considered a bout of inspired artistry, perfected a business model that revolutionized the restaurant service, and Ray Krok took that model and drove it into an international corporation with blind ambition, dogged persistence, and, what many will consider, a certain amount of criminal intent.This dichotomy immediately presents the viewer with an opportunity to identify with that which they feel is the most important. Without the brothers' initial design of the stores, born of desperation and perfected by inspiration, there would be no phenomenon as the McDonald's store. Without the drive and machinations of Ray Krok, there would be no phenomenon of the McDonald's corporation. I must confess I felt strongly for both sides. The McDonald bothers sought to keep the essence and quality of their business intact and seemed to be content with the small scale of their success. I associated with their integrity and decency, which was perhaps best depicted in a scene where, in a moment when they have come to believe that they have failed, they go into production for a sole customer, a young boy, and charge him nothing, happy to have made a connection with the community. (It is, of course, the turning point in a very big hallelujah! moment only possible in the movies).Ray Krok saw the bigger picture, even if it meant taking advantage of the brothers' goodness and naivete. He represents the drive of free enterprise, the inevitable expansion of any good idea that is desired by the public. I believe one of his many comments to the brothers, no doubt taken from his many ""inspirational"" audio recordings, is, ""hearts, like contracts, are made to be broken."" It is unfortunate that he is perceived to have kept a large amount of potential franchise money from the brothers, although some facts are either that may have led to a greater understanding of their situation glossed over or omitted from the film.",The Founder
204,christonr-64261,First there was an opportunity.. then there was a betrayal,6,6 March 2017,"It seems fitting in the current political and social climate to tell the story of one man's ruthless ascent to the head of one of the world's largest corporate conglomerates and his success, even in the face of being widely discredited and ridiculed. But Michael Keaton's portrayal of eponymous 'founder' Ray Kroc is far from the moustache-twirling villain one would expect of the faceless McDonald's corporation; and rather a very human performance which gradually sees his fallibility in - the form of greed - ultimately lead to a transformation (and becoming) as the mercenarial 'fox' in the McDonald's brothers 'hen house'.You cannot fault the film in providing a balanced, neutral and objective representation of all parties involved in the evolution of the McDonald's brand; blending fictionalized recreations of many of the key components, twists and turns which led to the company's success, with more trivialized cap tips and knowing winks to the audience regarding notable names, news stories and initiatives/(failed) ideas which have subsequently occurred during McDonalds' history. One cannot help but feel however that this is very much paint-by-the-numbers fair, which never really finds a distinct voice about its subject matter. At times, the zip, vigour and tone required of such a biopic is disserved by insignificant strands which feel an inert obligation to be tied up by the filmmakers; whilst other areas of interest (as a viewer) are suppressed or inexplicably discarded in favor of more watered-down background information – how much of this can be attributed to the film's contributors though is questionable. Keaton's performance is good, as is Nick Offerman – if a little scenery-chewing – as more outspoken brother, Richard 'Dick' McDonald, but otherwise performances do tend to be a little flat overall. On balance however, John Lee Hancock's biographical picture is informative enough to at least provide broad strokes of a message around the dangers of capitalism, extreme ambition and the might of big business.",The Founder

Kroc was always ready to find new ways to get ahead. He had the shark mentality required to succeed when others won't go an extra mile. Everything about this is covered very well in the movie.

But that discounts the fact that the film is rather well made. Performances are uniformly solid, and the film is undeniably compelling for much of its run time.

It was particularly gratifying when it reached a million. ""Way to go McDonald's!"" Later, when I was nearly homeless my one meal a day was a Big Mac. I was addicted to the sauce and pickles.""The Founder"" is the story of the man who built a fast food empire under those Golden Arches, a story rendered into film, produced at the remarkable low cost of $7 million. The timely screenplay by Robert D Siegel is pitch perfect, navigated by the faultless direction of John Lee Hancock, supported by a fantastic production team with special mention for art director Hugh D. G. Moody and his construction crew.I cannot overstate the relevance of this film in 2017.Ray Kroc (54), lonely, bitter, venal, sets out to achieve money and power using ""Persistence"" as his mantra. Failing as a kitchenware sales rep, he takes a road trip from his home turf in Illinois to uncover the secret of the phenomenal success of the brothers McDonald with their hamburger stand in San Bernardino, California – the template for what will become the biggest fast food franchise in history to date.Actors Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch play the brothers Dick and Mac, so different in size and manner, so perfectly suited as brothers, and with just the right touch of comedy, they convinced me they were indeed men of integrity and creativity.Kroc, expertly played by Michael Keaton, desperate to break the middle class ties that bind him, wheedles his way into the family business as franchise manager of what he foresees will become a super efficient, micromanaged fast food empire. Within two years Kroc outright steals everything the brothers created, including the family name.How Keaton is able to portray a character with such a hole for a soul is a feat of both madness and brilliance. As much as his performance haunts, it repels, one more testament to Keaton's breadth and skill as an actor.It is always a pleasure to see Laura Dern on screen, and it is especially gratifying to see her negotiate the murky shallows of husband Ray's vapid mood swings. The Dern / Keaton scenes transcend acting in a subtle dance of a marriage unraveling.Kroc is not a salesman to provide essential or public services like, say, school team uniforms, or to offer health services. He is not a salesman because he is inspired to it, or fated to be, he does so because he is so unimaginative, so unproductive, so without a clue, the only option is to perform as a salesman, hiccuping pre-digested pitches. Even his eventual fast food franchising claim to fame was prefabbed in the early 1920s by the White Castle Restaurant chain.The script interprets Kroc's rules of engagement impeccably: ""Business is war. It's dog eat dog, rat eat rat. If my competitor were drowning, I'd walk over and put a hose right in his mouth."" A ruthless white male at age 54 making his last stand – but on what foundation? A subscriber of a 1950s self-help course, Ray finds his perfect match in a phonographic sales guru who articulates: ""One word  PERSISTENCE. Nothing in this world can take the place of good old persistence. Talent won't. Nothing's more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius won't. Unrecognized genius is practically a cliché. Education won't. Why, the world is full of educated fools. Persistence and determination alone are all powerful."" The mantra becomes Kroc's, revealing a deep and abiding hatred of talent, genius, and education.Once Kroc steals everything from the brothers, he has to have the McDonald's name. After all, his phonographic guru has convinced him he's the founder. Even so, deep down he knows none of it originated with him. None of it. However, he did come up with one innovation, repurposing the American Dream as the Kroc Dream of unlimited self-serving power.Steal every innovation Ray, make America great, and take no prisoners, including democracy.",The Founder

Unfortunately, Richard and Maurice simply didn't have the business savvy to turn a revolutionary food service location into a national enterprise. Enter Ray Kroc, who was highly motivated and had the guts to go ""all in"", mortgaging his home to develop McDonalds into the state-of-the art international franchise it became.Highly entertaining, ""The Founder"" is a well written, small budget release, rated PG-13 for language. Appropriate for teens, ""The Founder"" is a good family night-at-the-movies venue. Nothing too offensive; your average 10-year-old has probably already incorporated into his peer-jargon!The cast is great. Michael Keaton as Kroc shines; I've always considered him as one of my favorites. Under-rated and so versatile, Keaton makes you believe in Kroc's vision and aspirations. Laura Dern plays Kroc's lonely and gloomy wife, Ethel. Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch really steal the show with their portrayal as the McDonald's brothers. Two very fine character actors at the top of their game! Patrick Wilson has a minor role as Rollie Smith, a restaurateur, who funds a franchise for his wife. She turns out to be totally committed to the fast food game and ends up being Ray Kroc's love interest. Linda Cardellini is beautiful and alluring as Joan Smith. Watch for Kate Kneeland as Kroc's efficient and vibrant secretary, June Martino.Currently available on DVD and Blue ray, ""The Founder"" is well worth seeking out.

John Lee Hancock as the director was acceptable, the things he could have done that would of made the movie better would be the progress of McDonalds after Ray Kroc bought the McDonalds brothers out of the business, like this all happened during 1950s where they only sold hamburgers, fries and milkshakes so they could of added the other menu items they added on like the Big Mac and Mc-nuggets and other menu items. They also could have added the original Ronald McDonald, which was kind of creepy. Things like this could have made the movie better and more entertaining.Feedback: If you are interested in the subject of this movie, I recommend you go check it out for yourself and what you thought of the movie. If you are just looking for a movie to watch, this is an okay option. Obviously the movie is based on a true story and is based off the golden arches we all know today. To be honest when I went to go see the movie, I had kind of higher expectations for the movie but the movie was still a great watch. The most fun thing about it was going to McDonalds after the movie to eat a burger and fries. With IMDb giving a score of 7.7/10 and Rotten Tomatoes giving 92%, I rate this movie a 7.1/10.",The Founder

I had always seen Golden arch, but I did not know such an interesting stories behind. Ray croft was not the nicest man in this movie, but there was something I could learn from his work ethics. He described it as ""persistence."" He was an okay milk shake salesman. He had a nice home and a nice wife. However, he was ambitious and his home and his wife were not satisfying for him enough. He was risking his property and started his business. He was obviously a risk taker, which most business people should be required. The relationship between Ray Croft and Dick and Mac McDonald was not lovely. The thing Ray Croft did to McDonald was not nice at all and he was not nice to his wife either. However, he did good things to the world. People all over the world can enjoy dining McDonald even today.",The Founder

Instead i saw a pr**k constantly deceive the McDonald brothers and screw them over. So p*ssed off its literally made me write this review. The movie deserves a 9/10 its easy to follow and makes a lot of sense. It's seems realistic to the era it was set in and the characters are portrayed well. I don't have any real problems with the movie itself. It's Ray f***ing Kroc that i have beef with. Yes he might of been the one to turn it into a multi- million dollar business and take it all over the country, but he f***ed over the McDonald brothers so bad. From breaking contracts, taking the McDonald's name and brand for himself. Constantly pushing the boundaries and pushing them into a corner where they are effectively forced into taking a measly $1m each. Ray Kroc has got to be the biggest c*nt I've ever seen. At first i was actually happy for the guy, he saw the restaurant and had a passion and wanted to expand, then when he was in he snaked his way through it deceiving and manipulating every situation so he benefits. I know he's dead now but f*** you Ray Kroc",The Founder
228,wendellfountain,Ray Kroc a True Visionary!,8,4 December 2019,"Michael Keaton was superb in this movie. As Ray Kroc, he had vision where the McDonald brothers were essentially pleased with the status quo. The film explores the early years in which Kroc was somewhat successful at selling, but he wanted to achieve much more in business. To this day, there is still controversy about the evolution of a small hamburger business that grew into a bohemoth. Yet, it was Kroc who was willing to experiment with the creation of new products for what eventually would become McDonalds. He and the McDonald brothers had different methods and ideas about growing the business. There are some ethical issues which arise in the movie in which Kroc and the McDonald brothers had some mutual responsibility, but all in all, this was a true story about the growth and prosperity of a small busiiness that became a giant in the fast-food world. I highly recommend this film.",The Founder
229,Fedoics,The Founder: Unintentionally a Comedy,5,30 January 2017,"Have you ever ordered a burger at McDonalds? You know when you order the burger and you look at this pretty plain looking burger and you take a bite and it's just bland and nothing special? This sums up The Founder.Let's talk about the good before the bad. Some of the acting in this movie was fantastic. Michael Keaton, Nick Offerman, and John Carroll Lynch all did fantastic jobs acting and bringing their characters to life. Keaton felt real and really acted out his role to the best of his ability. The film was directed pretty well too, many of the characters had something to do and effected the story in one way or another.Here's the bad. This movie looks and feels boring. The cinematography is nothing special, the soundtrack felt like it should have been in a made for TV movie, the editing was long and dull, the whole thing could have been cut up to be tighter and more interesting. There were some shots that made me bust out laughing like a slow zoom on Keaton with a out of focus man's head taking up 65% of the screen or Laura Dern's character sitting in the back of a room displaying one of the two faces she made during this film. There were so many simple small things that could have been fixed in post.The story in this film is interesting but presented in such a dull and cookie cutter way. It was like I was watching a documentary at times. A character is describing what something was and they just show an old black and white photo of what he was describing, slowly zooming in on it. It took the audience out of what that character was saying and left nothing up to the imagination. Overall, The Founder isn't a bad movie, but it also isn't a good movie.

Based on true events the film dramatizing the rise of McDonald's and effectively chronicles Ray Kroc's progression from mediocre salesman to business magnate. This is not the standard rags to riches tale which trumps out the usual notions that persistence and hard work will see a man through. While The Founder certainly trots out those virtues too it also portrays a protagonist who indiscriminately drives towards greatness which is a refreshing change. It is a nuanced film about the American dream but it does not skimp on the sour side of that American pie, that is the ruthless ambitions in the business world where nothing is ever enough. The film is well acted with a charming and comic performance by Michael Keaton as the try hard Ray Kroc. The narrative and direction is uninspired but ultimately entertaining.

Meanwhile Ray put up all the money and busted his behind to get the operation going. After everyone but Ray is making out well the brothers wouldn't even hear him out when he asks for a modest increase just so he won't lose his house. Had he not had a chance encounter where he learned about the real estate loophole he likely would've been ruined while the brothers would've continued to profit off of all of his efforts.Ray himself states he's a ruthless dog eat dog man who'd put a hose in the mouth of his drowning competitor. BUT not once does he engage in any illegal or unethical business practices. He treats his franchisees with respect, and he promotes people whom he'd worked with for years, including his former secretary at a time when that was all but unheard of for a woman. He even agrees to buyout the brothers for $2 million even though he could've crushed them.Since the brothers had taken no risk that is one heck of a payoff for what was essentially a licensing agreement and finders fee for the speedee system.",The Founder

I understand that the ""founder"" is portrayed poorly, but he gave ultimate capability to a growing brand, its franchises, and made its original founders each millionaires even though they took active measures to attempt to restrict the company's growth. They don't deserve any sympathy for being an impediment, especially so after becoming wealthy men. I'm happy for them, but this piece seems to set a tone where I'm supposed to feel bad for them. They took rewards even after taking said steps to impede the construction of what would yield said reward.It gives us a taste of business which I believe may be able to give today's youth or those who aren't savvy in business (yet) an idea of what a semi-hostile takeover can look like.",The Founder
241,wz-37217,Persistance,10,3 September 2017,"This film is still with me a week after watching. That tells me that besides a fast feast of entertainment, there were layers it took me longer to digest.Ray Kroc is a fascinating individual right from the start. We meet him on a typical day, driving long distances between restaurants, attempting to sell milkshake machines to distracted owners, using the same clever spiel over and over. He does it with an hyper enthusiasm that contrasts with his stillness as he sits in his motel room at the end of the day, absorbing a motivational record through his pores.When his secretary tells him that one restaurant has ordered eight of his milkshakes he decides, on a whim, to drive hundreds of miles out of his way to check the place out and that is when he first sees the small but thriving restaurant invented by the MacDonald's brothers.The contrast between their quiet, innovative brilliance and Ray Kroc's talent as a visionary, drives the movie and it flies from that point on. Yet there are things in common with all three men that exemplify mid 20th century America. The work ethic in these men and the young couples who bought the franchises was phenomenal, so was their power of positive thinking and their almost religious belief in ""family.""A considerable percentage of Americans had their first job at MacDonald's and we see a little of what they learned from the training they had there; courtesy, focus, and attention to detail. The teen who flipped the most perfect burgers really did go on to the top of the company.Ray Kroc's drive for success encounters the usual ethical problems that come with the territory, but that's only one part of this film which covers much more than just one man's success story.

244,lbacker,Very factual,10,15 September 2017,"One of the best biographical movies I've seen. It focused on the business aspects rather than converting Kroc's life into Hollywood schlock romance. It showed the essence of a merchandising genius who had the vision and drive to take an everyday product and refine it to be a mass market.Kroc was not even the inventor of the system or the product. He was the salesman. He entered the market long after other fast food outlets had either failed or stagnated. White Castle had moderate success. Dairy Queen was big, but never as successful. Whataburger is a Texas favorite, but never went national. Carl's Junior/Hardys has great food but never made the big time.Ray knew how to set up a system to market an average hamburger in a way that kept people coming back. His favorite saying was ""keep it simple stupid!"" KISS. He had a very simple menu. If you wanted chicken, go to KFC. If you wanted foofoo dairy products, go to Dairy Queen.He emphasized the FAST in fast food.His coffee was mellow Columbian. No Latte, no bitter Starbuck's swill that takes cream and sugar to kill the taste.The sequel to this movie should be ""The Unfounders"". Today's McDonalds acts like Ray Kroc never lived. Ray has been replaced by stupid politically correct wreckers.FAST is not part of their vocabulary. I walked out of McDonalds the last 3 times I stood in line waiting for over 10 minutes to place my order. I drove across the street to a Burger King, Jack in the Box, and a Wendy's and had my order filled quickly. So thoughtful of MCD to locate their store so near competent FAST food restaurants!Kroc's simple menu is replaced by 30 kinds of chicken, McRibs, etc with a McCafe menu of as many more foofoo drinks with lots of options. Couple that with a millennium airhead who takes 10 minutes to decide each item and you have a long nonmoving line.Then hire cheap people and don't train them. Give them an upsizing spiel to further confuse things. The result is slow order placement and wrong orders.Ray is spinning over in his grave. My wife and I now dine at Whataburger when in Texas. We choose Jack in the Box and Burger king otherwise. We shun McDonalds.The self order kiosk may be the salvation of this company that has lost it's way.This movie should be required viewing for all McDonald employees. It shows how MCD was.

A word that was often used in this film: Perseverance.I use this perseverance to evaluate the film. Because there was a persistent attempt to tell the film in an exciting way. In my opinion, this was not successful. There are some weaknesses in the structure. The film would have earned 30 minutes more to prevent these jumps.

There is such a fixation amongst the reviewers (us!!) about ephemeral details, that we seem to miss the big(ger?) picture...This is a panto (or dark morality play)..Cinderella meets Big Bad Wolf. We all know who the bad guy is, and who the good guys are supposed to be...without the aid of black and white hats. But there seems to be a subtle undercurrent...less simple, less obvious, perhaps more disturbing.What this picture does manage to do (hats off to Keaton) is redeem Ray Kroc (partially)...make him seem a victim of his generation's post-war desperate and forced optimism. It hints at a new kind of morality...if it works, its right! (Greed is Good?). It explores the exploitation of the naive, access to capital (or not!), land speculation as a means of filling the hole the capital markets were created to satisfy, rather than the exploitative casino they have become (oops, a nerve perhaps?)...finally asking the question...who was right, and who was wrong? The billions, the millions, the game....McD has become enemy #1, falling from the dizziest heights of crass; but to this day, they still occupy the richest real estate on the planet, generating the highest revenues (per child foot) on the most desirable streets et boulevards on this planet.So do we really care that Kroc was well named, or do we simply want our food 30 seconds after ordering...despite what it means for the staff, the locale, the planet, or even ourselves? I think if we see the movie in a more reflective fashion, we will find that it is we are the sinners...rather than, like the McD brothers, being sinned against. (Something in Julius Caesar springs to mind : ""the fault lies in ourselves..."") There was also a recurring reference to On The Waterfront that caught my eye, and a few other reviewers as well. I'd love to hear comments on it, now that the BB system has been shut down (!!). I might be over-reaching with two brothers, one of whom says ""I coulda been a contenda..."". It might also reference the off-screen antipathy between Mr Steiger and Mr Brando, whereby the defining back-of-the-car scene had to be shot green screen, because the two actors couldn't be persuaded to act together...contemporaneously, in a co-located fashion.Enough!

I liked a wee- bit hints pointing to an erased Blueprint musical opus from Jay-Z, as well as, a wee-bit referrals to an erased American Beatnik Generation of Jack Kerouac.

252,riddhimanroy,Persistence vs Personality,9,2 September 2021,"The Founder (2016) is an exquisite biographical drama film based on the true story of the American businessperson- Ray Kroc, the one who started the world's most renowned fast food chain: McDonald's. With a flawless screenplay crafted by Robert Siegel and under the powerful creative director- John Lee Hancock, this movie stands out as one of its kind. Being an expert in this genre, Hancock delivers his exact vision into every scene creating a profound impact. The film premiered at ArcLight Hollywood earning well deserved critical acclaim that also heavily lauded Michael Keaton's authentic performance as Ray Kroc.The story wonderfully depicts the events that occur in his life that shape the course of his career ahead as he rises from a door-to-door salesman to become the owner of McDonald's. Thrown into complex situational dilemmas, Ray is compelled to take decisions that have heavy long lasting impacts both on his job and in his personal life. Unable to suppress his extraordinary ambition and passion for the business, he tirelessly chases his dream of expanding McDonald's from a small neighborhood restaurant in San Bernardino into a nation wide franchise.Ray's inspiring driving force is made clear in the beginning of the movie by a playing record that recites the nobility of persistence and the value of hard work.His dedication starts to pay-off when he is credited with enormous fame in the Mid-West and expands horizons to the East Coast. The ever growing business not only profits in millions of dollars, but also multiplies job opportunities for people by manifold. Overnight, his success takes America by storm and the whole country starts to look up to him as an inspirational icon.However this hungry pursuit of his goal, takes a gradual heavy toll on his ethical self. It heartlessly tears down his relationship with his own wife and his trusting friendship with the original founder brothers of McDonald's. The new paths he voluntarily charters to expand his restaurant business even directly contradict the core humane values on which McDonald's was originally built. But none of this casts a genuine impact on his life, which has now come to be solely defined by his financial ambitions. Ray refuses to stop at anything until he fulfills his life-long dream.Ironically, though at times his stubborn motives seem to be selfish, it ends up rescuing the firm from billion dollar losses and saves the jobs of thousands of hard working employees.As the film plays to a close, Ray's sheer persistence pushes his company through several tough and uncertain years, ultimately successfully establishing itself as a global food chain. This mannerism of his proved to be an asset for his huge company, but it also came at the cost of economically devastating the lives of a few others. On the outside, this easily spells out as a bright success story of hard work and determination over fear. But it also revolves around a much darker internal theme, that we don't fully realize until the bitter-sweet ending when Ray reflects back on his life to prepare for a press interview.John Schwartzman's cinematography creates a deeper effect in our minds by making us feel the revealing story beats along with the characters themselves. Also the intentional use of brighter color tones of certain scenes is done to synchronize with the iconic vibrant colors of McDonald's. Laura Dern, Nick Offerman, John Lynch, Linda Cardellini and the rest of the talented cast play out their supporting roles just as perfectly.This film accurately establishes Ray both as a triumphant human being and as a selfish business tycoon, leaving the rest to the audience's judgement. A definite parallelism between the lives of Ray Kroc and Mark Zuckerberg (in 2010 film Social Network) goes unnoticed. And as the end credits roll over, we are left to ponder on the price of extraordinary success and its actual worth in our modern society.",The Founder

The balance of being persistent, being a people person and sometimes brutal in your commitment are lessons every one can take away from the film.

260,Voyage2-2,A 'sellout' moment you could only wish for,8,22 November 2017,"An enjoyable and entertaining movie, and a little slice of life. BASED on a true story. BASED on a true story, not a documentary. And many documentaries today are following a certain bias narrative anyway.Reading a lot of these reviews, I'm shocked at the ignorance to business so many have, perhaps emotional artists who see the World and Life through that prism. Reality is quite different. I want to zip to 1961, the scene where the two brothers are sitting across the table from Ray Kroc. The movie gives you the impression, of two simpleton brothers are 'accepting surrender' before the evil Ray Kroc. At the end of the scene, Maurice is holding a check for 1.34 million dollars. This is 1961 ! Do you know how few people held a check for that much money, written out to them ? CPI puts that at today's worth somewhere near 10 million a piece. For the uninformed, this is called payday, if you own a business, this is the day you hope and pray for, somebody big comes in and buys you out. Not real emotional and touchy feely, but a reality many in such situation would hope for. I laughed out loud, when in the following restroom scene with Dick, and the little 'pity party' comes out, and Kroc says, 'So, you don't have a check for 1.34 million dollars in your pocket ?' Wonder if Dick took the tears to the bank ? Another perspective. Using the rule of 72, and Dick lived until the late 90's, let's assume four doubles on a million dollars in 1961. That would bring us to 16 million for the last decade of his life, invested passively, totally liquid, and knowing the go/go 60's market, the Bear and Bull markets of the 70's and 80's. Even accounting for inflation, not a bad little nest egg for the World (of yet another Bull market to come) of then, 1991. As to the remaining 300k or so...the average income for a FAMILY in 1960 was just shy of 8,000 in New York and Boston, much more expensive then than San Bernardino was then. That goes into 300k 37 times. True, inflation would have eaten into that, still not overcome by short term interest income and probably wouldn't have sustained a 1961 standard of living to 1991, but it was one heck of a supplement for living expenses. As the old one million was slugging it out in the marketplace, passively. The 300k alone, was a far greater a windfall than most surviving families got from term life insurance policies designed to sustained survivors of the era.The one percent royalties promise is of legend. There's no hard proof this was ever made, the brothers never spoke of it. I presume they had attorneys to do this deal as well (sure, maybe not as heavy guns as Mr. Kroc), but it's a story floated by one of the nephews. How true, no telling, but, it does make a good story, so put it in the film. It would NOT make a good story if McDonald's failed six years later, as the brothers were investing and reaping the rewards of their windfall checks.Was Ray a likable guy ? No. Was he an idealist ? Absolutely not. 'Do it for America,' who didn't chuckle when he spouted trite lines as such ? But, Ray saw something the brothers could never see, he had a talent they lacked. Did Ray amass a level of wealth that dwarfed the brothers, sure. Besides his talent, skill and yes, 'persistence' he also didn't have the luxury of 'passive income,' or 'liquid' wealth. He had risk exposure the brothers would never had, costs he couldn't control. The brothers could always be a phone call away from having hundred dollar bills pile in their living room in five days (old settlement clearing house rules). The real lesson here is great things, ideas and empires are not self creating, they take blood/sweat and some tears. 'Greed' has been a nice tidy way of taring all we think we don't like about this kind of construction. But, greed doesn't create. It takes talent, persistence and yes, ambition. I don't think the latter points we should vilify. The Satin and 'Little Guys' narrative really needs to be put into real life perspective.The movie talent is first rate. Playing real life people in subtle manner, not over the top. Keaton is aces, right down to his Chicago accent, Arrr-right. Nick Offerman, mild 'everyman' works brilliantly here. Keep waiting for them to cast him in some movie about TR Roosevelt before he gets too old. John Carroll Lynch, again showing his range, from Zodiac suspect, to Walt's barber to Drew Carey's cross-dressing brother. The dialogue with the three is priceless. Dialog has its moments, mixed in with silence and slow music periods. Wasn't crazy about the greasy 'land attorney' who later worked for Kroc, how true to life he was, donno, but he came off slimy to me. Not a fan of the show 'The Office,' myself. In a sea of disaster, action Super Hero/Super Villain and dystopian stories, this is a fresh alternative. As with any period piece or doing any kind of make believe, the real World sometimes intrudes. The scene of the original McDonald's is very lush with vegetation more like Georgia than San Bernardino. When Mac's in the hospital, the room number signs are clearly modern, not of the late 50's early 60's period. At the closing table, when the brothers sell out, there's a red modern fire alarm behind Keaton. When Ray at the end of the movie, is working on his speech for Governor Reagan, and he walks away, you can hear the hollow sound of a movie set, not the solid sound of a permanent house/structure.",The Founder

In our crazy age of CGI, explosions, and gratuitous violence, this film proves there is nothing quite so compelling as REAL conflict between REAL human beings.I thank all the artists involved with this project. It gave us an insight into something BIG that happened in our culture -- first in the US, and eventually in countries around the world.The writing, acting, direction, music, production design -- all fabulous.Regrettably, the movie had a box office of barely over $24 million.

262,sunnyfox,Couldn't finish--made me hate McDonald's,2,1 October 2018,"Don't think I've ever hated a Michael Keaton character as much as I do this POS. Started out thinking it was going to be a movie that would be interesting and fairly entertaining regarding McDonald's roots. What it ended up being was a movie that made me so pissed off that we turned it off and quit watching the last 20 minutes of it, because I wasn't about to watch any more of this scumbag of a subhuman sack of excrement exploit & screw over--presumably without suffering ANY consequences himself--EVEN--any more nice, trusting people like the McDonald brothers. Seriously made me want to boycott McDonald's. It's disgusting that someone so vile never got their comeuppance in the wake of all the nasty, slimy exploits he inflicted on others. I can't recommend this load of garbage to anyone. All it did was make me angry that I got suckered into renting this in the first place. I thought it was going to be somewhat of a comedy, judging by some of the trailers. At the very least, it looked so much more lighthearted than the dark, sinister character that Keaton's Kroc turns into early on in the movie. No ""entertainment"" value whatsoever unless you're a sadist who enjoys watching good, decent but naive people being mercilessly abused who are undeserving of such shabby treatment like so much mindless reality tv. On the other hand, if you enjoy watching scripted morons throw food at one another, get into fake cat fights, i.e. all the bogus ""Housewives"" drama-lama BS shows, this just might be your thing. Ray A. Kroc himself gets an ""F""--or maybe that should be an ""A"" for ""A-hole""--the movie itself gets a ""C-"" just because it's revolting that anyone felt this turd deserved to have a movie made about him. Kinda' like Tonya Harding...but that's a whole different rant.",The Founder
263,kristian_cooper,Kroc. The man who revolutionized the food industry and drove two brothers out of their own business,8,29 November 2016,"The Founder was directed by John Lee Hancock and stars Michael Keaton, Laura Dern, Patrick Wilson, Nick Offerman, John Carrol Lynch and Linda Cardellini and tells us the true story of the rise of one of the most recognizable brands in the world McDonald's mainly focused on the period of time when Ray Kroc joined the business and effectively ""robbed"" the McDonald brothers of their creation, a truly fascinating story that many of us would never even think about when tucking into a Big Mac and fries.Hancock is no stranger to biopics having bought to the big screen Saving Mr Banks and The Blind Side in previous years and while those films had some compelling performances they also had some really great source material to work from. We have been blessed with some great biopics in the past the social network and the big short but I felt that at times the McDonald's story was lacking elements of what those great stories had for example unlike Eddie the Eagle or Hacksaw Ridge you feel that there was no heroic figure to get behind and root for as such. Nevertheless the film works well within the confines of what they could do with regards to script writing and direction. We can begin with the obvious highlight of the film being Michael Keaton. Seriously I hope this guy doesn't become the next Leonardo DiCaprio and having to wait forever for an Oscar but will this film finally bring home the trophy? Is very hard to say considering that we have the likes of Casey Affleck and Ryan Gosling also making waves. Keaton was perfectly cast as the lead role of Ray kroc in the film he's ruthless, he shows so much emotion and is simply energizing to view on screen. He's got all of Kroc's mannerisms that I had seen in YouTube footage and such In fact it felt like he studied Kroc inside out.The McDonald brothers were played by Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch and I have to hand it to them because they also did really well in their performances especially when there was tension between the McDonald brothers and Ray kroc. Unfortunately not all the performance were really up to scratch. For example Laura Dern's character really didn't have too much screen time when compared to Keaton, Offerman and Lynch and I guess it shows in her so so performance.The script was enjoyable enough to hold your interest but as is the case with every biopic these days those typical montages of information both in the beginning and also at the end are in this film as cliché as it is. Here it happens when we get the McDonald brothers back story. You'll also find unlike the recent film The Big short where they had a really good way of explaining technical things in this film, in this film business ideas were discussed but not necessarily explained for the layman. But did they get the cinematography right? did they get the look and feel of the fifties and sixties right? You bet indeed they did which was a big plus from me and the soundtrack was one that matched the film perfectly.The Question is the will I come back to watch this film again and Have my perceptions changed about McDonald's after watching this movie? The answer to both questions is probably not. This film just doesn't seem like it warrants a rewatch due to the nature of the subject matter nevertheless I'm sure everyone will end up seeing it in the same way everyone see the new Marvel movies. My perceptions of McDonald's haven't changed because I always knew McDonald's for the ruthless corporation they were and without giving away spoilers I can say that the way Kroc acted as a businessman has really had an effect on the McDonald's business itself as a whole and I can attribute the current business model and any issues and scrutiny that has arisen from the way that Kroc turned the company from a small burger stand to a multi billion dollar international empire.Ultimately the performances are what really draw you into this film. The Story while after seeing the film no longer seems like a great American success story as such was as interesting as they could've made it on the big screen and even if you don't eat McDonald's it's worth checking out. I always think of the founder every time I walk past my local golden arches now and I think the film deserves a worthy 4/5 based on Keaton alone. Its no birdman but still compelling viewing. Would you like some fries with that?",The Founder

Through hard work, determination, and thinking constantly on ideas to become more successful (with some help from others sometimes), a middle aged struggling salesman can find success when dealt the right cards. Meanwhile the people who invent the possible goldmine business aren't always capable and the best people to progress the idea into greater fortune.This is a good movie for a business major to watch. Some of the tricks of the trade by what Keaton's character discovered that would make McDonald's grow in popularity and in fortune is common knowledge nowadays, but you still cant help but root him on as he discovers these things. The McDonald brothers on the other hand are too scared to risk anything and are content with what they already accomplished. In this film you see examples of stubbornness on both sides of the main characters, but showing it in opposite ways.The 'go getter' vs the 'we already did's'.

Honestly, I didn't know McDonald's's founder the name, the story behind it, and so on. In my town, we don't have any McDonald's operating, but countless number of ""kings and bigs,"" shameless copies. The point is ""burgers"" aren't know-how anymore, it's a part of our life. ""McDonald's"" success is as Ray Kroc believes in its sound, spelling, pronunciation. It's not their employees' strong work ethic, affordable prices of food, perfect location, lightning-fast service, etc., etc., — backbone of the success is just the name. You can re-negotiate it, but now it's highly unacceptable due to ""handshake."" What it means? The Founder is a movie, in a nutshell, how the business world works, and we see it through eyes and actions of Ray Kroc who is a classic asshole of American business, and who cares? If mostly people don't care about being either right or wrong, but succeed. Michael Keaton is really good at acting late-success stories. I don't know why. Also, the title ""Founder"" is a sarcastic.Let's go back to ""disturbing"" part of my review. Ray Kroc died a long time ago. That would be super good to hear his opinion about the movie, as Steve Jobs can't make any statements towards two titles with his name. If the latter was total chaos and failure, the Founder is so good.The mistake was, as I just learned today, directors and producers of ""Steve Jobs"" title were trying to portrait him instead of telling the story. ""The Founder"" is a great story about how to succeed in this life no matter what. Did I feel sorry about Richard and Maurice McDonald? Who cares?",The Founder
270,demasvandijk,Every success story has its origins,8,15 August 2019,"Sixty-four years McDonald's exists now. In those days the company with the distinctive 'Golden Arches' logo has grown to become the synonym for fast food. A characteristic of the franchise chain is that their food tastes the same everywhere in the world, whether you place your order in a small Himalayan town or in the smoke of the Louvre in Paris. The company was a pioneer in developing techniques and strategies to provide the customer with his hamburger, fries and milkshake within half a minute. This came about in the late 1940s, at a time when grilling a burger usually lasted about ten minutes and you had to wait a long time for your food when you were standing in line. The impact of McDonald's on the world has been enormous, although it is now somewhat waning. There is even a so-called Big Mac index, developed by the renowned magazine The Economist, based on the idea that the famous double citizen is the same everywhere in the world but can represent different value in purchasing power.Every success story has its origins and that of McDonald's is revealed in the biopic The Founder, in which the wonderfully pivoting leading role is reserved for Michael Keaton. He plays colporteur Ray Kroc, who has great difficulty selling his revolutionary milkshake machines. The United States is full of burger restaurants and dinners, but no one wants to go with Kroc, no matter how slippery he makes his sales pitch. Kroc cannot believe his ears when a civilian farmer in California places a huge order. Out of curiosity, he decides to take a look and meets the brothers Dick and Mac McDonald, who have developed a method to produce hamburgers on the conveyor belt that also appeal to consumers. Kroc can use a success and knows how to persuade the brothers to join him. The condition is, however, that the citizen brothers keep a firm grip on everything.With his fifth feature, John Lee Hancock sketches the dazzling history of a regularly controversial billion-dollar company, which is not only a symbol of success but also of the increasingly voluminous American. Hancock's reading of the script by Robert D. Siegel, the man behind The Wrestler, can be seen as the film version of an exciting boy's book that from the outset seems to consist solely of successes. But appearances are also deceptive here. The singular in the title already suggests that not the two McDonald brothers, but Kroc is the actual founder of the hamburger conglomerate. Whereas initially everything is still friendly and Kroc listens to the wishes of his two business partners, the venom is growing directly in proportion to the expansion of the group. The rippling narrative through the friendly tone gets a big boost from that moment on, and Hancock shows that clever business instinct is the only way to success. Kroc gets hold of everything and everyone and that results in amusing moments in all tragedy for the injured.This opens perspectives for Keaton's game. We know from the outset that Kroc is not a sweet, accommodating businessman, but sketching his civil home situation casts a smokescreen that lingers for a long time. But even if this accelerates, the question remains for a long time whether Kroc is acting from a plight or whether he is simply a race opunist. This issue is gradually being settled while Hancock is tightening its characters. Not only for the McDonald brothers is more and more at stake, Kroc also takes greater risks and gains arrogance. Due to the high profile of the fast food chain, Hancock does not have to focus on its image. He makes clear how groundbreaking the company has gone to work, in order to be able to fully focus on the character developments and the feats they raise.The luster of Keaton's character gets a little worse with the passage of time. In the beginning he is primarily a man who wishes you some prosperity, eventually you will develop an aversion to him. You feel embarrassed, but that is exactly what the makers must have been after. The question of whether Kroc is just smart or shark is constantly hanging above the material, without the ease of the screenwriter strike. You must admit that Kroc has taken a very practical approach, although there are still some questions about the ethical aspects of his method. After his recent roles in high-quality productions such as Birdman and Spotlight, Keaton once again demonstrates how versatile he is as an actor and his skillful playing prevents Kroc from becoming predictable. He is full of confidence and perseverance, which only increase as his actions begin to bear fruit. His supporters have to check.",The Founder

For a typical family, they have the option of forgoing the hard work of cooking in favor of having hamburgers in a short time (I never said it's a good thing, just an option).

Small town salesman stumbles on the chance of a lifetime, and from it creates a food empire. Along the way, things start to change. Against the noble-minded but provincial McDonald brothers, Ray Kroc struggles upstream, good-hearted American dream seeker at first, then insidiously segueing into the vicious, cannibalistic uber-capitalist that he insists is absolutely necessary to establish great marches for himself.Well acted, well done, this movie tells the story chillingly well. Keaton, with his indomitable go-forward-and-blitz-the-opposition really knocked my socks off. To no small manner was his dry, monotonic, gravelly voice expressing his quick, no-nonsense, no-further-argument directives in a manner like orders from a colonel: end-of-story, no questions accepted.OK, the movie. But why did I call it ironic in my summary? Now, the product. A few years back I showed the movie ""Supersize me"" to a class of high school students.

Afterward, he was obese and diagnosed with a variety of ailments that took a lot longer than the month he OD'ed on his McGorgings. So, putting these two films side by side is the iron: A man with very questionable ethics creates a gonzo empire that sells a product with questionable health value.

287,stitch-61328,Not A Hollywood Hatchet Job,8,8 September 2017,"""The Founder"" tells the remarkable story of how McDonald's became McDonald's. Centered on Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton), whom the film makes clear intuitively understood the significance of what the McDonald brothers created, ""The Founder"" follows Kroc as he progresses from two-bit traveling salesman to obsessive franchising agent to corporate titan. As his arc progresses, the sense of entitlement and bitterness hinted at early in the film begins to subsume his personality.But this is not an anti-business screed in the vein of ""The Social Network,"" to which ""The Founder"" has been compared. In ""The Social Network,"" Mark Zuckerberg is portrayed as a creep from start to finish. Keaton and director John Lee Hancock layer Kroc's character with complexity and nuance. The same with Dick and Maurice ""Mac"" McDonald (Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch), the brothers (and true founders) who brought assembly line mechanics to food preparation, on which fast food empires of today were built.Although Kroc did not invent the ""Speedee"" food prep method, he immediately grasped its value. The film shows us his ordeals at a series of drive-in food stands: waiting thirty minutes or more while car hop girls flirt with boys rather than take orders, which they then get wrong. We also see the effort and personal risk he puts into the franchising project, mortgaging his own house and micromanaging franchisees. The film shows us he's as dedicated to cleanliness and quality control as the McDonald brothers are.The McDonald brothers, while portrayed as honest and hardworking, are not naïve marks waiting to be exploited. Indeed, it is Dick McDonald's vision to expand McDonald's into a regional and perhaps national chain. Yet he is held back by his stubbornness and inability to embrace constructive change. While the film shows Kroc traveling the country to recruit franchisees, I counted only three scenes (one a flashback), when we see the McDonald brothers outside the environment of their burger stand. Ultimately, their intransigence brings Kroc's shark- like tendencies to the surface. Still, the viewer is left to wonder if the brothers would have been part of the company's incredible growth had they been more open to what Kroc was learning as the franchises expanded. In addition, the film subtly captures the changes America was undergoing during the 1950s. Hancock gives us glimpses of the emerging car culture, the growth of suburbia and optimism of middle- class upward mobility. Together, these serve to underline the fact that Kroc's idea for a nationwide brand of restaurants that provided tasty food quickly and inexpensively in a family-friendly environment came at a near-magic moment.",The Founder

The one and only complaint I have is the soundtrack. Often, it felt out of place, unnecessary, and very stereotypical. In fact, most of the scenes where the soundtrack was bothersome didn't require any music at all, but the dialogue alone had enough momentum. Of course, Hancock didn't have to go with the non-existent, No Country For Old Men-style soundtrack, but I wished he had gone with that approach a couple of times instead of having to listen to this bad soundtrack. Everything else about this movie is good. Great writing, acting, and cinematography.",The Founder
289,assadhelu,Good things come to those who wait,8,30 November 2020,"In my opinion, a movie is successful when it rises emotions in the audience, when it lefts you thinking about the plot for a while after you've watched it, when you are living your daily life and something makes you remind that movie; certainly, The Founder is one of those films.First of all, this is a biopic, and this subgenre can be difficult to direct because you not only have to stick to the script but to a specific storyline that actually happened oriented to a single guy, in this case, McDonald's executive founder Ray Kroc; and this is the first hit of the film. John Lee Hancock does not direct the film portraying Kroc's personal life, but it tells the story of the most famous restaurant in the world through the eyes of the man who made it gain that title; from the lowest point of his life to the very top.Second of all: This is Michael Keaton's show. The man proves once again why he is one of Hollywood's finest actors and why his name will prevail for many years to come. His portrayal of Ray Kroc is top-notch, as a man thirsty for success who will go big or go home, taking with him anyone who wants to ride but also leaving anyone who doesn't behind, no matter who they are. Nick Offerman provides a pretty solid performance as Dick McDonald, the smartest of the real founders; John Carrol Lynch demonstrates that he is one of the most versatile and underrated actors in the industry, playing the brother that had the heart but not the brain, Mac McDonald. Laura Dern, Patrick Wilson, B.J Novak and Linda Cardellini fill up the cast with smaller but important roles.The second hit of the film is that at first sight, it's the typical story of success; however, when you start to see what success takes for Ray Kroc, you may reconsider the synopsis of the film. In my opinion, The Founder is the story of a dreamer, a man that aims high but never gets past halfway, until he does; ""you're not in the hamburger business, you're in the Real Estate business"", this marvelous line sums up what Kroc was missing, an external advice, the teammate he always dreamed of. That is indeed a story of success, but if you see it the other way around, it is the story of a very clever man that took everything from two brothers that had a dream but refused to grow, and that is exactly what makes this film great, that you don't have just one way of seeing it. Kudos to Robert Seigel who clearly wrote a top-level script.In the technical aspect, production and custome design are perfect; the cars, the mode, the atmosphere, and complemented with a great cinematography, it really makes you think you are seeing the 50's with your own eyes; and that scene when Keaton is doing business with Wilson's character at the fancy restaurant, it gave me Goodfellas vibes. In addition, editing was just flawless, it kept the pace of the film the whole time and it didn't let the audience look away; the real footage was a very nice detail, a wink to the subgenre itself.The ending is everything except happy, you start the film rooting for Keaton's character but at the end it just doesn't feel right. If I had to use one word, I'll say heartbreaking; the McDonald's brothers literally looking as their business slip away.Finally, at the very end of the movie Michael Keaton goes full Ray Liotta and breaks the 4th wall, addressing the audience with the message that motivated him since the beginning: he who perseveres, conquers.",The Founder

Of course, nowadays takeaway food is a convenience most of us enjoy but at some stage during the history the idea of having your burger, fries and ice Coca-cola was a novelty that first began spreading in America.In 1954 a salesman Ray Kroc met with brothers Dick and Mac McDonald, the owners of the hamburger restaurant known as ""McDonald's"". Fascinated by the brothers' ability to have burgers and fries cooked in 30 seconds, Kroc suggested the idea of franchising the restaurant nationwide, hoping to use this as a way to take control of the company and earn money for himself.I really enjoy this movie because it is fascinating to see how one simple idea has changed the culinary world forever.

I actually found myself tearing up at the ultimate fate of the real founders of McDonald's, Mac and Dick McDonald.While this may not be the greatest tragedy in American history, it does speak to the cancer of capitalism without conscious.

I think the experienced veteran was the perfect man for this leading role and he filled those boots perfectly. Linda Cardellini and John Carrol Lynch also did amazing in their lesser but still prominent roles. The pacing seemed good for the most part, except for some small areas. Most importantly I was kept entertained without the movie being too over the top.As I said earlier some parts in the beginning seemed a little rushed, but in all honesty I think it would've been better if they cut these scenes from the movie entirely. The whole part where Michael Keatons character takes the McDonald brothers out to dinner and they tell him their story with all these flashbacks just seemed tacky. I'm sure they could've come up with a better way to quickly summarize the humble beginnings of the mcdonald brothers. More than that the editing in these scenes was straight up awful, it looked like it was trying to be some sort of action flick flipping through these. This was most likely due to the rushed nature of the whole conversation which by the way sounded completely unnatural. Luckily after this awful scene the film starts to save itself.One more critique I have is the performance of Nick Offerman. I've seen him in a few things and he seems to love being Ron Swanson so much he wants to always be him, except in this film he was not funny.",The Founder

So, that's it: The Founder is about a really not humanized monster, that is Ray (and that's real, he is a real jerk), that takes the name of McDonald's of the ""McDonald's"" that were also jerks. With a really not helpful script, and a really superficial cinematography, ""The Founder"" don't help at all to be a ""great"" movie about the problems of the industry, like ""Social Network"" that was one of the greatest movie about this shitty guys.

Only point I would have mention is sad end of one of McDonalds brothers who died the day after hearing that the 1500 McDonalds was opening in town near his hometown in Concord NH. Kroc inspired by the American Dream is human, not perfect and is shown to be a liar the end and one must think adulterer reading between lines. Keaton performs adeptly as Kroc, a perfect casting.

309,georgegibson-16412,Storytelling at it's best,10,23 February 2017,"(please expect spoilers throughout) This film succeeded against all expectations of both the public and corporations alike. the film had a strange premise which compared to those of a fictitious nature often evolving around action could be seen as weak, even against other biography's which may centre around a more commercially appealing concept and yes too a extent the premise is weak but this is irrelevant to the quality of the film, all a weaker premise does is make it harder for the filmmakers to keep it interesting, yet this film somehow makes the story of franchising MacDonald's one of in my opinion amazement. the film follows Ray Kroc as he discovers a restaurant doing a little better than its competition and makes it the biggest restaurant chain in America (the fact that McDonald's ended up big is probably not a spoiler to you) yet it also shows the effect this success has on Ray's family, himself and the tragic effect it has on the McDonald brothers the original founders of MacDonald's. Overall i believe this movie tells the story of McDonald's so beautifully that it can be making you feel good with Micheal Keaton showing us hope and desire with his brilliant performance and with it's epic light nostalgic cinematography but as the movie continues a feeling of desperation and tragedy appears to emerge i have not been moved by a movie quite like this for along time, never would have expected that from a movie about a chain of fast food restaurants.",The Founder
310,i-13203,"A great film - based on a true story, but does not disappoint",8,11 April 2017,"A lot of the based on a true story films end up disappointing me. They end up changing way too much to make the character likable and relatable, moulding a person from a remarkable event in his life into a Hollywood hero.This film does not do that. This man is not a hero. He is more of a hustler than a hero, a con-man of sorts, dancing on the edge of legality, where things are legal, but not right, where he is in breach of contract, but powerful enough to go to court and fight it. He did not have money, but he had an insatiable thirst for expansion and he was a true visionary.This film does not attempt to sanitize the story. He is who he is, he did what he did and this film just tells it in an interesting way.The only flaw I see in this film was that it gives him the powers of retrospect before things happen. This is a common theme in innovator films. You see someone who invents something great, but Hollywood takes it to the next level, making him predict the internet, smartphones, and everything 30 years ago. I was there 30 years ago. No one was making those predictions, especially not giving details and the road to the future. The road to the future features a lot of wrong turns, detours and dead ends. Here, Kroc envisions coast-to-coast McDonald's, massive expansion, the golden arches, the ""American church"" and all that that entails all from the start. The fact is, references to McDonald's being a big part of American culture, soft power and being an American icon came later, much later, by observers, only after the fact. There's visionary, there's dreamer, and there's clairvoyant and this film goes a tiny bit too far from optimistic, hustling businessman into the realm of prophecies. On the other hand, I'm glad they didn't go too far with that. I'd hate to see Kroc predicting Happy Meal toys, partnerships with Disney, the pada-pa-pa pa jingle and so on.The acting was exceptional and everything looks like it belongs in its time. As others have said, things look like they belong in their place, not just their time. The cars are regular cars, the clothing is regular clothing, the props too.

He is eccentric, but not over the top. It's easy to like him, easier to hate him. All along the film, Keaton's portrayal of the betrayal is executed with perfect timing, much thanks to an excellent script and a beautifully crafted period setting. This, alone, would earn its star rating. Why it does not earn a perfect score, however, is because the subject matter, though interesting, is a turn-off. The fast food industry is under the gun for promoting childhood obesity, heart disease, and other controversial social issues. The way the film advertises itself looks like a promotion for the brand, rather than a story in history's shadow. The first impression upon reading the synopsis, or looking at the promo art, is ""Who cares?"" which most likely follows with, ""Screw those people!"" What they should have done was promote the central character and let the audience come to the realization of his significance during the film. ""The Founder"" is not really about McDonald's. Why put the golden arches in red and yellow to promote it? This is a fascinating car-wreck, all-American story that is neither appealing or unappealing -- just is. However, it is also about all of us.

Not a bad guy, just a guy trying to make it as a salesman.The McDonald's brothers are two decent guys. I'd put Kroc in the ""decent"" camp as well at the beginning of the movie - it's something I think that some other reviewers missed.Kroc goes out and starts the franchise. He sees that the people he initially pulls in aren't sticking to the deal and they're selling fried chicken and corn on the cob (which the McDonald's brothers expressly said they didn't want). Their stores are ill kept and kitchens dirty.Kroc seeks to fix this and starts enlisting younger couples starting out who will have their entire life rolled up into the business instead of the wealthy looking to ""park their money"" (the problem before). It works. Soon he has McDonald's opening up across a number of states. A few problems exist:1) Kroc is losing money. The percentage of his take in the contract is too low
2) The franchises are struggling because the freezer costs are too highKroc had a number of ideas that he took back to the McDonald brothers and they said, ""No!,"" each time. They said, ""No!,"" to Coke sponsoring the menus, to the ""insta-mix"" milk shakes, and to renegotiating the contract.While these guys were ""good"" they were a little too stuck in their ways and wouldn't address the problems at hand (Kroc not making money and the franchises having problems) and basically just came back, over and over again, with, ""Well, that's the contract you signed."" That's great. It's not a contract that's making money, however.Because of this Kroc has to get inventive about how he makes money because the McDonald's brothers won't budge an inch on anything. This is an important piece I think many leave out when they land on, ""Kroc was an evil capitalist!"" They miss his growth throughout the film and the challenges he faced. At the same time, they miss the over-ideologic brothers who seem to be just set in their ways. Here's a guy out there, essentially, building an empire for them and they won't get on board for anything.Anyway, you see Kroc turn from a rather decent guy into a guy who'll stop at nothing to get what he wants which, to me is what made the movie. There's a story there. There's character arc. This is so much better than the stamped out Hollywood super-hero movies or SFX movies with, ""Here's another can of what you want...""Well paced.
