0,SnoopyStyle,fake dog,6,9 May 2020,"There is a gold rush in the Yukon and sled dogs are needed. Buck is a big dog. He has the run of his town due to his influential owner, the Judge. He is dognapped and shipped up to Alaska where he is sold to kind mail carrier Perrault (Omar Sy). He is also befriended by drunken recluse John Thornton (Harrison Ford). When the mail route gets canceled, he is sold to vicious reckless guide Hal (Dan Stevens). More and more, he hears the Call of the Wild.Fake Dog. Fake Dog! That's a fake dog! For the first half hour, it's a flashing neon sign. I do understand the freedom to use a CGI dog but it would be so much more real to use real dogs. I'm also tired of the showy CGI moves. The best CGI moves are being as normal as possible. Eventually, one accepts the CGI. There is a bit of humor, a bit of adventure, a bit of anthropomorphism, and a bit of Harrison being Harrison. It's fine.",The Call of the Wild
1,nogodnomasters,The pack can only have one leader,8,1 March 2020,"This is a sanitized adaptation of Jack London's novel. It leaves out some killings. Buck, the wonder dog, is dog-napped and sent to Alaska where he excels and passes from one owner to another although no one ever really owns Buck. The film includes some minor narration. Geared for a young male audience, although anyone can enjoy it. Realistic CG.Jack London was an atheist and a socialist in case you were unaware.",The Call of the Wild
2,kosmasp,Call goes wild (CG ... W?),7,22 May 2021,"Although it should be more Computer Generated Dog (and other stuff). Now if you are a dog lover you probably won't mind. And overall speaking this is really well made. It doesn't take away me wondering how they made the original movie though? I reckon it must be similar to this, also having a lot of dog scenes and all that.In this you can clearly see the dog not being real. As good as the effects are, you can still tell what is real and what is not. The actors are quite real and kudos to them for interacting with ... nothing I assume (though maybe there is something - would be cool if they had a real dog on set who sort of did certain things)! The dog also seems to understand almost everything humans are saying ... which makes it worse when you see some despicable characters not treating him right ... but you gotta have villains now don't you? So take it with a grain of salt and you'll be more than fine ...",The Call of the Wild
3,classicsoncall,"""Is there any house big enough to hold him?""",7,1 November 2020,"I hadn't seen any reviews for this film before watching it so the CGI threw me off for a minute. I mean it's really well done, but you have to acclimatize yourself to the fact that Buck and every other animal in the picture was computer generated. I haven't read the Jack London novel upon which the story is based, but as so often happens after I see a movie of similar circumstance, I make it a point to do so in the near future. (Which I'm currently doing with 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo').Personally, I liked the movie, but I can understand viewers ruing the fact that it's a sanitized version of the original work. It appears that the Disney folks gave it a family friendly treatment to appeal to the youngsters in the audience, and on that basis I thought they did a good job. On the flip side, I have to wonder at the manner in which films include cultural diversity that was never a feature of the source material. A black sled driver with a Native American companion stretches credibility about as far as one can get without being silly.I was impressed by a particular scene where Buck takes over the lead dog sled duties and averts disaster for the team and it's human counterparts. It was when he led the dogs through the icy tunnel while the avalanche overhead was hurtling down the mountainside. If I might be allowed to guess, I think I smell a new adventure ride at Disney World.",The Call of the Wild
4,CinemaSerf,Engaging family adventure.,7,25 February 2020,"This is a gentle film about loyalty. A spoiled ""Buck"" is dognapped from his comfortable American home - where he usually runs riot - to be sold as a beast of burden in the frozen wastes of the Yukon. Initially he struggles with the workload and the cold but soon settles in to the routine pulling the mail sleds. When that is overtaken by the telegraph he is sold to a gold-rush amateur (Dan Stevens) who almost runs him into the ground before he is rescued by loner Harrison Ford and our real adventure begins. It's a little slow to get moving, and it can be quite difficult to discern the (fairly poor) CGI from the reality, but the story is about determination, fortitude and affection and makes for a perfectly watchable film with the odd bit of humour thrown in for good measure.",The Call of the Wild
5,Calicodreamin,Decent,6,21 February 2020,"The cinematography throughout this movie was quite beautiful, with the landscapes and the cgi on the animals. The characters were well acted and well scripted, but they had no depth. I didn't find myself very emotionally invested in the story. It was a decent movie in all aspects, it just wasn't too much of anything which left it a bit underwhelming.",The Call of the Wild
6,AlsExGal,Harrison Ford saves this film,6,23 February 2020,"This film was really meant to be a post Christmas family film, and it probably succeeds at that. What really bothered me is that the dogs are completely CGI. I can understand it for the scenes where the animals would be in peril, but for the close intimate scenes between man and dog, it really hurts the film to not have a real dog in the part of Buck. Also, this tale is of a kinder gentler Buck, not the tale in the Jack London novel.I might add an extra star if you are just trying to entertain some kids for a couple of hours. For the adults, seeing that Harrison Ford is the old pro he always has been is probably going to save the experience for you.",The Call of the Wild
7,bombersflyup,"Beethoven's back and he's gonna be in trouble. Hey-now, hey-now.",4,2 April 2020,"The Call of the Wild is a feel good family film, with CGI animals.Has its moments, doesn't reach any great heights though. The first half much better than the second. Buck terrific, but CGI limits it, not the other way round.",The Call of the Wild
8,deloudelouvain,"Well made but not very joyful, not my idea of fun.",6,1 June 2020,"My wife liked it more than me, she scored it a seven, I scored it a 5.5. The story is most of the time just animal abuse and that's not my idea of fun when I watch a movie. I know those aren't real dogs, it showed even though it was well made, it's just a story I can't enjoy truly. I can watch human mysery as much as you want, couldn't be bothered by it, but when it's about animal cruelty I just can't stand it, and in this case there are a lot of those scenes, too much in my opinion. I can admit there is quality in the imaging, the story not so much. The acting is what to expect with family movies, it's never going to win any awards for the acting. I don't regret watching it but I won't watch it again in the fututre, for that it's just too depressing.",The Call of the Wild
9,ThomasDrufke,Far Better than the Trailers Showcased,7,3 March 2020,"With bad trailers containing some very noticeable CGI and green screen, The Call of the Wild had a tall hill to climb, but it managed to do it rather efficiently without betraying its audience. I always say it's not hard to make a dog film enjoyable for dog lovers. Ensure the film isn't too manipulative, create a solid connection between the 4-legged lead and the audience, and you're on your way. The Call of the Wild is a classic tale of how a dog can change someone's life for the better and vice versa. It's one of the oldest in the books. Effective? Absolutely. Aside from a few poorly written side characters, I really liked my experience in the theater. It has my stamp of approval.7.7/10",The Call of the Wild
10,westsideschl,And the Award Goes To ...,2,18 May 2020,"No award for script adaptation; no award for acting; no award for dialogue; barely an award for B.C. Canada background; no award for honesty. Award goes to the 600 or so people associated w/animation along w/the latest computers to make it all make-believe-real. Very cartoonish as our main character, Buck, seems to be a human in an animated dog's body. Too phony, not a good ""homage"" to the harsh reality in the original tale.
Also, the dogs' non-verbal, but human like communication was just over the top laughable. So, was this suppose to be a comedy? Except, we did burn a man alive.",The Call of the Wild
11,slightlymad22,Enjoyable Family Movie,7,19 February 2020,"I just got out of Call Of The WildI have to say, I enjoyed the hell out of it.Ok, the CGI dog is nowhere near Planet Of The Apes levels of greatness, but it's certainly better than the trailer suggested and I was moved at all the right times. The CGI in general was a bit ropey at times, but it's only a minor gripe.Harrison Ford is as reliable as you'd expect, and truthfully, he is more invested in an original role than he has been in a while, at least in anything I have seen.I think it is quality family entertainment, there are some funny moments there is no bad language and it moves at a quick pace. But I think this will have to find its audience on home release.As sadly, I don't think this will find much of an audience, as there is too much kid friendly competition. I think it would have been perfect for a Thanksgiving/Christmas release!! I think it would have done better, if it was released then.It was about half full in my screening, about 40/50 in a 100 seat hall.",The Call of the Wild
12,UniqueParticle,Wonderfully endearing adventure film,8,23 February 2020,"Such a lovely story about friendship, dedication, loyalty, and amazing cuteness throughout! Very cute well worthy RPX experience, I'm very pleased with everything that occurs! Harrison Ford is still awesome at his age which is impressive for someone in his mid 70's. I absolutely love adventure stories and Call of the Wild is well done for what it is. I'm sorry my review isn't sufficient enough for anyone I still had fun, it's great ride of dog adventures.Edit I have autism give me some credit",The Call of the Wild
13,cruise01,So-so film that relied heavily on cheesy cgi and thin plot trying to carry an adventure film.,6,22 February 2020,"The Call of the Wild (3 out of 5 stars).The Call of the Wild is a fair adventure film about a dog named Buck who was never fitted to be a house dog. But gets kidnapped and sold to a dog sled team of a mail carrier. If you are a dog lover or love adventure movies that takes place during the Klondike gold rush than you will also love this movie. The movie is decent. It has some exciting action sequences but I did feel like the cgi on the dog Buck or other animals in the movie were kind of cheesy. The production settings of the beautiful scenery is amazing. The cast was okay as well. And the plot was kind of thin.The plot follows a dog named Buck. After making a mess for a family get together dinner. He was kept outdoor their farm house. And some trader kidnapped Buck. Sold him to a dog sled mail carrier. Mail carrier Perrault (Omar Sy) and his partner Francoise (Cara Gee) and their dog sled team traveled far and fast. With Buck taking charge of the sled. Facing against the dangers of the wildlife and nature with the avalanche. Then, Buck comes across John (Harrison Ford) who then also wants to travel up north. Going on an adventure to find gold.The plot was okay. It did not have much depth with the story. Besides the movie just following Buck and his adventures. He was feeling like an outsider. Couldn't fit in to anything. He wanted to take charge of the sled. Facing against their alpha dog. He comes across horrible dog owners who break their dogs with aggressiveness. John is an explorer who is running away from home cause of a traumatic experience with his family.The film does have some exciting action sequences with Buck taking control of the sled and riding against dangerous landscapes. Even with the avalanche scene was breathtaking. But it was all cut short. It is a bit family friendly when it comes to intense scenes or violent scenes. There is a brief conflict with John and Hal (Dan Stevens) who have a brief fight. Which Buck comes to the rescue for John.Harrison Ford is a great actor and did well with his role. The rest of the cast were in it briefly. Dan Stevens playing Hal, a guy who is obsessed in finding gold than losing his people. Karen Gillan playing Hal's love interest. Which her character was in it for a brief scene as well. Omar Sy and Cara Gee did have a spotlight for a moment as riders for the dog sled.The film does suffer from a weak cgi with Buck. Yes, it is better to have a cgi dog than a real one to participate many dangers in the movie. But the cgi was a bit cheesy for this expensive film. The visual effects of the production scenery was stunning and beautiful. The characters being relied on cgi was a bit off.Overall, A Call of the Wild is a fair film. The production and visuals are stunning. The cast was okay. The plot was thin. The cgi animal characters needed work. The adventure was a bit meaningful.",The Call of the Wild
14,eddie_baggins,Far better than the trailers made it look,6,3 May 2020,"For a $135 million dollar costing financial flop that stars a much ridiculed CGI dog as its main protagonist, The Call of the Wild is a surprisingly watchable family affair that is nowhere near as bad as its terrible trailers or marketing campaign made it look to be.Marking his first foray into non-animated feature film-making after well-liked efforts Lilo and Stitch, The Croods and How to Train Your Dragon, director Chris Sanders had a difficult task adapting Jack London's famed source material for the big screen and you can sense the film is never completely comfortable within itself as our computer generated furry friend Buck sets out on an Alaskan adventure filled with life lessons, gold and a grizzled Han Solo.It takes us as viewers sometime too warm up to Buck in his current form, something that would not have been the case had Buck been played by some real life pooches (just look at recent effort Togo as an example) and it hurts Call of the Wild in the long run as Sanders tries to invest us into Buck's journey that takes him from spoiled pooch to mistreated captive on his quest to be partnered with Harrison Ford's isolated alcoholic John Thornton.On the way to this inevitable pairing, there's a somewhat enjoyable if not overly well-established sub-plot with Omar Sy's mail delivery sled team owner Perrault, which is fine if not particularly memorable and a terrible Dan Steven's appearance as the horrid extremely overplayed villain of the piece Hal but once Thornton arrives on the scene, Call of the Wild becomes a far more enticing experience that showcases the potential of London's source material, too display a likeable scenario of man and dog's friendship.It helps that Ford seems as invested in this role as much as his been in the last few decades, delivering one of his better all-round performances in some time as his on screen charisma and enthusiasm helping us forget that Buck is only ever mildly believable in his imaginary form, no doubt necessitated by a raft of situations in the film that would've been impossible to pull off with a real life canine in the role.There's not a lot of surprises to be found narratively here, with London's story pillaged and pilfered from in the many years since it was published but with the film's latter half more than making up for a rough beginning and weak segments, this pretty to look at example of financial failure on a big-scale is a film that many will still find highly entertaining and enjoyable.Final Say -Overcoming some at times hard to take CGI and a poor opening half, The Call of the Wild isn't a new canine classic but its central relationship between a lost human soul and a caring four legged friend makes it an adventure you won't regret taking.3 gold nuggets out of 5",The Call of the Wild
15,pmtelefon,Entertaining,8,30 May 2020,"""The Call of the Wild"" ends up being a very entertaining movie. It takes a little while to get used to how Buck and the other animals look and act but once you see how the movie is going, you get into the groove pretty quick. There is a nice balance of humor, action and heart in this movie. ""The Call of the Wild"" is well played by its cast. It looks great. The story moves well with zero downtime.

16,digitalbeachbum,"Great book, terrible movie",1,12 April 2020,"There are far better versions of this book rather than this Disney-ish version of the original story. I found it boring and lacking in any sense of purpose. The fake dogs were also terrible. I couldn't get past the lack of reality concerning the animals. I understand how it is more difficult to get dogs to do certain things, but the other versions of this story did just fine using live animals.I'm guessing that they didn't want animal abuse to be shown, but the whole reason for Buck's fighting spirit was because he was abused and beaten. In this version they show one strike and Buck gives in and converts to a trained dog who can pull a sled.There are also other dogs, which aren't even remotely able to pull sleds, but that is a technical issue with the director's decision.Overall, I did not like it even though Harrison Ford was in the lead role.",The Call of the Wild
17,matthewssilverhammer,perfectly average,6,9 July 2020,"The decision to make this a live-action movie with CGI dogs was a GIANT mistake. The story is cornball-greatness and told with admirable sincerity; if it was all-animation (and Harrison Ford wasn't, once again, asked to do unnecessary and lackluster voice-over), it might've been a rare, modern family-film success. Still, the heart wins out enough to make this perfectly average film marginally recommendable.",The Call of the Wild

Not too surprising as they are doing man's best friend and they have it down packed.

21,stevendbeard,Better Than I Thought It Would Be,7,22 February 2020,"I saw ""The Call of the Wild"", starring Harrison Ford-The Expendables 3, Cowboys & Aliens; Bradley Whitford-Godzilla:King of the Monsters, Get Out; Omar Sy-Jurassic World, X_Men:Days of Future Past and Dan Stevens-Legion_tv, Beauty and the Beast_2017.
This movie is based on the Jack London novel of the same name and is a remake of the 1935 movie, Call of the Wild-notice the missing 'The' in the title. This is a live action/animated hybrid that uses CGI to digitally scan a real St. Bernard & Scotch Shepherd mixed breed to appear to be actually on the screen. That's right, Buck the dog is not really there. Most of the time, it looks pretty good but I think they kind of overdid it a few times when Buck used human expressions. The situation would be funny but most dogs I've encountered did not act or look like that. Anyway, the trailers are a little misleading, too. It looks like it is a Harrison & Buck movie but he is only one of the companions to Buck-he is also the last. Bradley-a judge on a plantation-is the first to own Buck. Omar-a postal delivery man that uses a dog sled in the Yukon to make his deliveries-is next to own Buck. Dan-a man on a mad hunt for gold-is the next owner, and he is not a nice man. Finally is Harrison. If you can get past the CGI, the movie is pretty good-it was better than I thought it would be. If you are a dog person, you should enjoy it.
It's rated ""PG"" for violence, peril and some mild language and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would make a good rental.",The Call of the Wild
22,robfollower,The Call of the Wild : Review,8,23 February 2020,"The Call of The Wild is a solid, incredibly well made movie. Buck is an extremely likable protagonist who goes on a compelling journey of self discovery. Despite being a dog and not having a word of dialogue, Buck is an incredibly interesting, three dimensional character with a well developed arc. The CGI used to bring him to life is amazing. While it doesn't always look natural, Buck's CGI model is so expressive and can cause the viewer to experience a variety of different emotions, despite not even being there.Harrison Ford also does well as the elderly, depressed John Thornton, carrying a great deal of tragedy and mystery about his past throughout the movie. The movie also features stunning cinematography, with several beautiful shots and camera angles. It's a true joy to watch.The Call of the Wild is a familiar but heartwarming adventure that's surprisingly funny and emotional. Chris Sanders' direction is great and there are some thrilling set pieces. It's well filmed, well paced and the music by John Powell is fantastic.The novel is beautifully written and also heartbreaking. The movie pulls at the heart strings enough to be effective without ripping said heart apart. Lots of kids and laughs in the theatre. Go and see it. 8/10",The Call of the Wild
23,alindsay-al,A Good Heartfelt film,7,27 February 2020,"I am a huge fan of Harrison Ford so when I saw the trailer for this film I was interested and I have now seen The Call Of The Wild and this is my review. The premise of the film sees a dog taken from a life of luxury and attempt to adapt to a new lifestyle when he meets humans and animals that will have a huge effect on his life.
Main Character
Now I know I mentioned Harrison Ford but the actual main character of the film is that of the dog Buck. Now this film could have been very cheesy and silly especially if the dog had started talking but luckily it doesn't do that. Buck is one of the most fleshed out characters of the year so far and that is crazy when you consider he doesn't speak one word in the film. You just see in his body language and the way he acts the way he is speaking and you really do grow to care about Buck and want to see him succeed in the film.
Supporting Characters
Now on to Harrison Ford, he isn't actually in the film as much as the trailer makes out but when he is he does a great job. He seems to care in this film which is important for Ford and leads him to give a strong performance which has a great blend of drama and humour. He has the most personal connection with Buck in the film and you really grow to see there friendship and it is really nice and powerful to watch. It is especially impressive when you think that the majority of his acting in this film is with a CGI Dog. Omar Sy plays the first person to come across Buck and I thought he bought a real energy to the film, I liked how his character and Buck interacted and grew a bond, it was nice to see how it comes across and how both of them benefit from their friendship. Dan Stevens is in this film and he plays an antagonist that is after Ford and Buck in the film and even though he isn't given very much to work with he looks like he is having quite a bit of fun in the film and seems to revel in his corny villanous role.
Story
Now the first half of the story for me was excellent, it was fun and exciting but also had the appropriate amount of depth especially between Buck and the head of his new pack, it is a compelling part of the film and one that really works. However, the 2nd half of the film moves at a slower pace and I didn't really find it that interesting, seeing Ford and Buck interact was nice to see and it had a good ending but I just feel like the film couldn't quite keep the energy that the first half of the film had.
Script
This is an interesting script as the main character doesn't speak one word in the whole film, with the dialogue for the human characters it is fine. The drama feels well handled especially for Ford's character as he has quite an emotional backstory and it is well handled and some of the little bits of humour was nice. But, there is nothing that is very memorable about this script, not many lines I can remember or exchanges that I found to be overly interesting.
Style
The style of the film looks great mostly, the film is shot really nicely and there are some stunning visuals to look at. There are also some really fun sequences that are exciting and sometimes dramatic to watch. Though the biggest issue I have is that Buck himself looks incredibly CGI, now obviously I know he is a CGI dog but the good CGI is when you forget that the character is CGI such as Thanos in Avengers Infinity War, in this film it just looked really fake and at times it made me feel like i was watching a CGI creature.
Overall
Overall this is a really good film, it has quite a bit of heart to it and this is a good watch for families and people who are dog owners for sure. It's not one that you need to rush out to see but if you do see it you will be entertained for sure.",The Call of the Wild

25,pixrox1,Not content with merely having invented Fake News . . .,8,28 February 2020,". . . 20th Century confesses to creating packs of fake dogs, not to mention herds of fake caribou and schools of fake salmon for the latest film version of THE CALL OF THE WILD. What the unit publicists are NOT ballyhooing so loudly is the fact that EVERY human being seemingly appearing in THE CALL OF THE WILD also is fake! Think about it. Would any REAL actress allow herself to be transported by a swift-moving frigid current about half a mile UNDER thick ice?! If a producer even suggested to a stunt wench that she should do something like that she'd call Me Too immediately! If you examine the rest of the folks apparently peopling this flick carefully, it is fairly easy to see that they are just as fake as the underwater woman. Whenever any of them fall in the dirt, dust and mud, they always get up without having a speck of debris on their clothes. Furthermore, they parade around with totally exposed faces in arctic conditions which would destroy their visages through the process of frostbite within a few seconds of unprotected exposure. Besides Buck the Dog, Han Solo is the MOST fake critter presented here of all. Half the time when he's talking you cannot even SEE him on the screen! When he supposedly gets fatally shot-gunned in his stomach, there's not a drop of blood to be seen. Han may have spent an afternoon sitting on a high stool in a sound studio recording his lines like a cartoon ""voice actor,"" but it's perfectly clear here that he never set foot in the Northwoods!",The Call of the Wild

Mr. Powell is someone to keep an eye on in the future of film music. Harrison Ford does a credible job as does Omar Sy, but it is the animation that steals this film away from the actors. The animation is so good that you don't even realize it is animation. Of course, the story by Jack London is a classic, and nothing beats a good story. The film is also a metaphor for our young men and women leaving the roost when they arrive at a certain age and the pain everyone goes through when that inevitable event takes place.

28,yusufpiskin,A Jack London adaptation with CGI... REALLY??!!!,4,8 April 2020,"Surprisingly faithful to Jack London, albeit in a more family-friendly, politically correct way, this is an enjoyable, almost classically old-fashioned (in terms of plot & script) adventure. Ford actually seems awake for most of it, but it's still stolen by uncannily emotive CGI animals, who dominate every scene they're in.",The Call of the Wild
29,kluseba,A missed occasion,6,19 June 2021,"The Call of the Wild is an adventure movie based upon Jack London's novel of the same name. It revolves around a crossbreed dog named Buck who lives in an elegant mansion in California. The dog eventually gets abducted and shipped to the Yukon aboard a freighter. In the North, Buck first works for a friendly couple who delivers letters across the isolated territory. Up next, he is forced to work for an inexperienced and mean-spirited gold prospector and only narrowly escapes death. He ends up living with a recluse named John Thornton who has to battle some demons of his past before returning to civilization. In this isolated world, Buck finds a place called home when befriending a pack of wolves. However, the evil gold prospector is aggressively going after Buck and John Thornton which leads to a tense finale.The movie misses a few occasions to be more than an average family-friendly production. First of all, it's quite obvious that Buck and several other animals aren't real but animated characters that look surprisingly outdated by contemporary standards. The film would have been much more authentic if it had used shots of actual animals with more precision, patience and care.Up next, the film is filled with artificial visual effects. That's a shame because the landscapes in the Yukon are truly stunning and would have made for stunning shots that are much more convincing than exchangeable locations and computer graphics.The movie's saving grace is the swift plot and its different characters that entertain from start to finish. Especially children and young teenagers might find the dynamic movie quite entertaining. As for older teenagers and adults however, the film is at times predictable and even stereotypical.At the end of the day, The Call of the Wild is an average adventure movie that should please younger audiences. Older teenagers and especially adults can however stay away from this film that offers as many flaws as strengths.

32,aidanratesmovies,"An Incredibly Generic, PG remake",4,16 September 2020,"A dull, pretentious, and incredibly generic retelling of an incredible tale- The Call of the Wild isn't just another shameful remake, but a film that doesn't even have the courage to try something new. I'll start off by saying that this film isn't a disaster, rather it's just incredibly mediocre. There is nothing thats sticks out to me about this film different from other adaptations, besides the fact that it is in fact different, just not nearly as good. The writing is lazy, the film seems too long, even though it hardly succeeds the 90 minute mark, and the acting is incredibly forced- as well as the overabundant use of CGI. Not only does the CGI compromise the heart of what this film should stand for, but it proves to be oh so obvious, in so many parts, that it takes you out of the film just to wonder why they ever did it in the first place. Harrison Ford tries his best, but his lines and old man act get quite tiresome by the time the film ends, not to mention he is on screen in only half the film. Besides all of these flaws, the film also isn't very entertaining, as it grips you with the seemingly same or similar material throughout its whole runtime. There are some good shots in the film, as well as some thrilling music in some scenes, but it isn't enough to tie the film together as something even remotely poignant, and instead you just feel like the effort put in is put in all the wrong places. It's a story and a film you have come to see again and again, and all Disney has really seemed to do with this classic tale, is slap a few big names on it, and hope it earns them a decent profit. It's a lazy and honestly pathetic cash grab of a film, and I would be rather surprised if I don't forget most of it by tomorrow.

35,jadepietro,Kibble,4,25 December 2020,"IN BRIEF: Loosely based on the Jack London novel, this movie makes our lead dog more superhero than needed and the uneven CGI work adds little to this sentimental tale.JIM'S REVIEW: (NOT RECOMMENDED) I remember when I was 7 or 8 years old being captivated bu a smart collie named Lassie. Boy, that dog was loyal, well-behaved, and could do just about anything and he was REAL! Well, I guess they don't make dogs like they use to. How else can you explain The Call of the Wild (2020), an overt example of CGI manipulation than cries wolf whenever it can, with nary a real animal in sight.Disney Studios have spend tons of money and talent converting their animated classics into live action remakes. This may be the first time a live action feature morphs into a cartoon, with enough dopey slapstick and sugary ""aah"" moments that just didn't make the medicine go down for this reviewer...and I love dogs!For those unaware of the story, we follow the life-affirming journey of Buck, a St. Bernard mix, as he goes from a tamed contented life into a series of misadventures, all leading to finding his true self. It's the perfect story for any boy or girl to experience. But this film's treatment of its classic source simplifies its tale with too many false and saccharine scenes that outweigh the real drama.One can blame a muddled screenplay by Michael Green that guts the Jack London novel and makes this animal adventure saga a series of melodramatic perils populated by cardboard characters, the sub-standard formulaic direction by Chris Sanders who trivializes this once-interesting story, hammy performances that play to a children's matinee audience expectations, or the real culprit: the film's uneven CGI. While the details to the dogs' physical features are impressive as is their movement, the exaggerated features of Buck, our Superdog, are so humanized that one can easily spot the artificiality of the process. Having our canine hero wink, tilt its head as if on cue, or pseudo-express with those winsome eyes becomes so inauthentic and phony. But the faux facial recognition factor is minor compared to the acts of bravery that the filmmakers have Buck perform, instilling him with super powers that only a 7 or 8 year old could love or believe. (Why Buck even morphs into a righteous tee-totaling breed, which seemed to go against his St. Bernard pedigree!)In fact, the film does have two saving graces: Janusz Kaminski's lovely cinematography of snow-covered vistas and Harrison Ford as one of Buck's many masters, John Thornton. This fine actor brings a sense of normalcy, grace, and authenticity to his role.
His narration also gives the film a home-spun vibe. Mr. Ford is the only real thing in this family-oriented movie (although some scenes are a tad intense for the younger crowd.) The rest of the cast is dreadful, with Omar Sy, Cara Gee, and especially the usually reliable Dan Stevens as one of Buck's cruel and evil masters, as stand-outs. Mr. Steven's is so convincing in his best Snidely Whiplash impression that I waited eagerly for Dudley Do-Right to appear in a cameo role.As family fare, I suppose The Call of the Wild (2020) might fill the bill for some less finicky moviegoers. For this reviewer, the journey seemed interminable. Calling Lassie! (GRADE: For moviegoers between the ages of 7-10 years old: B- / All others: C-)",The Call of the Wild

Trailers Have Given Some Decent Scenes AwayWhile it may not give the time needed to bring the full details out, this iteration of Call Of The Wild is certainly better than I anticipated. Buck's journey holds many levels of enjoyment from comedic fun and cuteness to the deeper, heart heavy moments that will help you invest into the movie. The acting with CGI dogs is surprisingly fun and all the sense of adventure and character development makes for a much more balanced tale. Certainly some elements are blunted, with truncated finishes to most of the acts, quick bouts of overcoming the impasses, and even some sadder moments that you see coming, but can't turn away from. As I said in the full review, the CGI is great in terms of physiology and injecting energy, but the realism and cartoonish effects are a little less impressive given other feats of technology. If you can appreciate the positives of this style though, you are in good shape, but if not, then skip this film. In terms of visiting the theaters for this one, the answer is yes due to enough adventure and special effects to get you in.

37,rannynm,Mixed feelings. Some CGI Scenes are Brutal! Great story though.,8,20 February 2020,"My feelings about this movie are quite mixed. On one side, the use of CGI helps to portray the strong emotions of the dogs. On the other hand, there are many scenes containing brutal animal abuse that many audiences will find disturbing and unsettling. The storyline, however, is incredibly well-structured and detailed.The Call of the Wild is about Buck, a fearless, strong dog who has been through so much in his life. After being shut out on the porch of his California home, Buck's name is called and he finds himself in the hands of a dog seller, who locks him inside of a box for transport. A while later, he is recruited as a puller for a dogsled that delivers mail in Alaska. After a journey full of twists and turns, Buck discovers a whole new world with someone he loves and trusts by his side.Some of the lead characters include John Thornton (Harrison Ford) Perrault (Omar Sy) and of course, Buck. What really stands out is the CGI that is essential in expressing the emotions of the animals. It is really effective in this aspect of the story. The dogs look almost human! With such emotion in their eyes, and their actions, there is barely anything that humans can't relate to. (Except for the furriness!) My favorite part of this movie is in fact the CGI. The difference it makes in it is emotionally impactful and helps the audience feel attachment to the characters, and love for them too. It improves the quality and aesthetic which makes the viewing experience vivid.This movie strongly conveys a message of how perseverance is enlightening and can make anyone a stronger, more intelligent person who can take on more difficult challenges than ever before. It is definitely successful in signifying this empowering lesson through symbolism and emotion, and definitely reminds me to push through the problems that I run into in life. There is something that the audience should look out for. There is some extremely aggressive behavior that is inflicted upon animals, and between other characters. Several weapons are used, such as a whip, a bat, and guns. Minimal amounts of blood are shown. There really isn't any bad language, however.I give this film 4 out of 5 stars, and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults. REviewed by Ruby A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",The Call of the Wild

It is a journey of dog from his earlier master from city to wild life beyond the mysterious mountains. Many sequences of dogs sledging are brilliantly filmed. One of them is best when Buck takes sledge under the ice mountain when ice cyclone is high. Good role by Harrison Ford of a old and alone man who saves Buck. Climax is interesting and end is different from usual animal's movie, specially of dogs. Story is mostly believable and this will connect you till the end.

I don't think any of the scenes were filmed outdoors. The CGI they used for dogs looks like from the 80s..They made the dog cartoon-ish . it just immediately didn't do it for me. Dogs are some of the easiest animals to train and cheap to obtain (unlike exotic animals), WHY!? of course the one thing they never get right is the eyes. I honestly felt like the biggest problem was that there are about five plots, happening in quick succession after each other but I still felt the movie was rushed they didn't have enough time to develop characters. The mail people seemed to have a bond with Buck that I don't understand where it came from and I thought Spitz was going to be a character for longer so we can really see what all the dogs have been dealing with from that rough leadership. They also showed a bit why Spitz was acting in that way because the mail guy didn't tend to him as much as everyone else but it still felt rushed. I don't blame them because they definitely did not have enough time to get all the characters and adventures perfected but I did feel something was missing.",The Call of the Wild
47,msbreviews,"The Call of the Wild is such a heartfelt, compelling, and emotional story that dog-lovers will definitely enjoy.",7,13 March 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I couldn't catch The Call of the Wild when it premiered. Therefore, I didn't remember a single thing about it when I went to watch it yesterday at an empty screening (yei). Once again, I stayed away from trailers, but a few images popped up at the time. The CGI dog didn't look good at all. With reviews coming out and weeks passing by, I couldn't avoid concluding that most of the negative opinions are due to the ""distracting animation"". Knowing that the visuals would probably be disappointing compared with the story, I still watched it with moderate expectations.I'm genuinely surprised by so much negative feedback. I really enjoyed it, and it's one of my favorite films of the year, so far. Yes, it doesn't mean much, having in mind it's only March, and it will very likely not even receive an honorable mention by the year's end. Nevertheless, the supposedly distracting CGI dog (Buck) didn't bother me in the slightest. Buck might not be a perfect animated animal, but as long as people go in with the right mindset, the chances of enjoying the story are much higher.It's an animated dog. Accept it, move on, and everything will flow a lot easier. I believe it belongs in that ""uncanny valley"" category. Something weird might work well for some people, and horribly for the rest. I didn't mind it at all, and I go as far as saying that a few moments are elevated exclusively due to the dog's expressions. I also defend that this movie needed the CGI dog instead of a real one. It's not an ordinary dog: Buck is stronger, bigger, taller, and he has a special wild instinct that home dogs lack.To be clear: Buck isn't visually perfect. Sure, there are a few scenes where the CGI becomes too overwhelming and awkward. However, it doesn't detract from the heartfelt narrative. Buck is undoubtedly the main character. He has emotional conflicts, personal motivations, a distinct personality that changes along with his adventures, and a part of him that he needs to explore. The first half of the film is packed with action, fun, and a clear purpose. It's extremely captivating and entertaining, even if it follows the usual, predictable storylines. Good performances from Omar Sy (Perrault) and Cara Gee (Françoise) during this portion.The second half is when Harrison Ford's character (John Thornton) finally comes in (he scarcely shows up until then). From now until the end, the movie employs a slower pace, focusing on Ford's reflection about his life, and Buck's journey to find the place where he ultimately belongs. Harrison Ford delivers such a subtle, emotional performance. I can't remember the last time I saw Ford so committed to a role. John possesses a devastating, tragic past, and Buck is able to bring some joy and fulfillment into his life. For a dog lover like myself, it's such a tear-inducing, genuine, heartwarming story.The only aspect I truly dislike is, unfortunately, Dan Stevens's character (Hal). He's just an incredibly cliche, despicable ""villain"", who doesn't fit with the rest of the film. I love the actor, but his over-the-top display doesn't always work, and Hal suffers a lot from his exaggerated manners and expressions. In my opinion, he could have been completely removed from the movie, and it would have been a lot better. Totally unnecessary, and lazily written subplot, to be honest. Oh, and Karen Gillan (Mercedes)? I literally just discovered she was in the film as well...The Call of the Wild is one of those movies that suffer from bad trailers. People either skip it or go in with a pre-defined negative mindset. It proves that the best (and only) way to judge a film is to simply watch it. CGI Buck isn't an animated work of art, sure, but he's far from being distracting or annoying. To be honest, I feel that he elevates a lot of emotional moments. Buck is exceptionally well-written, standing out as a complex and emotionally compelling protagonist. I laughed, I cried, and I felt entertained by all of his crazy adventures. Harrison Ford delivers his best performance of the last couple of years in a slower-paced second half of the movie, after a frenetic, action-heavy first half. Dan Stevens' character is definitely the worst aspect of the story. An unnecessary, cliche, horrible ""villain"" with no place in the narrative. All in all, I highly recommend giving this film a chance! Avoid its trailers, accept the fact that Buck is, indeed, an animated dog, and try to enjoy the genuinely heartfelt story at its core.Rating: B+",The Call of the Wild
48,maccas-56367,Exceeded expectations - enjoyable adventure flick!,8,19 August 2020,"This definitely exceeded my expectations. Was an enjoyable adventure flick. Hard to go wrong with Harrison Ford and a dog!In some ways, it's unfortunate this came out so close to the release of Disney's Togo. It shares numerous similarities, but doesn't quite rise to the same heights as that film. Despite its downfalls, I still enjoyed The Call of the Wild.The big talking point for many will be the CGI-dog, Buck. After a while, you get used to it - I did anyway. Given the crazy adventure-style of things, it became clear why they opted for CGI. I actually thought they succeeded in giving Buck personality and character, so it worked on that level.It's definitely the kind of film to switch-off that voice in your head that calls things out for being far-fetched. Just go along for the ride. Embrace the film for what it is, and you'll find that you have a good time. Some of the scenery is spectacular.There were some touching scenes, though I wasn't as emotional as I thought I'd be. I haven't read the source material, but thought the ending here was good. Harrison Ford and Omar Sly put in good performances, though it also just felt like something was occasionally missing.For being set back in the old days, it definitely had a modern feel at times. It won't be for everyone, but I love dog movies and adventure movies, and I felt this combined them both well. Good to see Harrison Ford again too.

51,MrDHWong,"A good natured, albeit artistically uneven film about following your destiny and discovering your true potential",7,25 June 2020,"The Call Of The Wild is an adventure film based on the novel of the same name by Jack London. Starring Harrison Ford in the lead (human) role, it is a good natured, albeit artistically uneven film about following your destiny and discovering your true potential.In the late 1800s, a large, overly friendly St. Bernard x Scotch Collie named ""Buck"" is abducted from his home in California and transported up north to the Yukon in Canada. Upon arrival, Buck returns a harmonica dropped on the ground to a man named John Thornton (Harrison Ford) shortly before being sold off as a sled dog to a pair of mail carriers. Due to him not being used to this new snowy environment, Buck struggles at first at becoming accustomed to his new life of pulling sleds but soon finds encouragement in his visions of a dark wolf guiding him through his challenges and obstacles to eventually gain the respect of not only his fellow canines but also the humans around him.As yet another adaptation of a well-regarded American novel, this version of ""The Call Of The Wild"" should please casual audiences with its adorable four-legged star carrying the weight of the film through every step of the way. I am unsure, however, how closely it sticks to the original story as I have not read it in full so I can't fully determine how satisfied longtime fans of the source material will be, although from what I have researched, they seem to be somewhat divided on what has been omitted. Apparently, there have been some liberties taken with the overall mood of the film as the book reportedly has a much grittier feel that may have been toned down in an effort to create a more family friendly viewing experience. Normally, I would be annoyed at something like this happening but I actually felt more at ease while watching the film as it allowed me to take in more of the adventure without worrying too much about whether something terrible was about to happen. Some may argue that this is playing it safe but I'm not too bothered with that as I enjoy a good carefree romp in the wilderness so long as I can share it with characters I care about.Chris Sanders, who makes his live-action directorial debut, having previously co-directed ""Lilo & Stitch"", ""How to Train Your Dragon"", and ""The Croods"", does handle the film quite well, showcasing his knack for creating memorable scenery and his fluid use of cinematography helped establish the wide expanse of the Yukon and the various oddities and perils that one might encounter on their travels. However, I believe he felt a little too worried about stepping outside his comfort zone as he did overuse CGI at times, to the point where it became highly distracting. For example, Buck would sometimes clearly be a real dog huffing and panting his way through the snow while other times his movements looked unnaturally cartoonish, notably in one scene involving him jumping up and down on a bed. We see his legs flail around like a ragdoll as he tries to wake up his master but anyone who has seen how dogs really jump will know that their legs stay straight when pouncing on something. Fortunately, most of this is forgivable as I can understand the difficulty in training a real dog to perform some of the actions shown in this film and CGI would obviously be a much cheaper alternative. It just proves that no matter how nice CGI may look on the surface, there is no substitute for the real thing.I enjoyed Harrison Ford's performance as the stern but kindly wanderer John Thornton, who spends his time roughing it in the wilderness alongside his canine companion. Ford also narrates the film as well, in a manner that can be likened to a grandfather reading a bedtime story to his grandchildren, which adds a sense of childlike innocence that young viewers will definitely come to appreciate. Even though he may not have looked visually convincing at times, I loved seeing Buck and his journey from a pampered domesticated house pet to a hardened and respected dog of the outdoors. I suppose I'm just a sucker for dogs being the central role of a film as I have always had a soft spot for these wonderful animals and what they're capable of.In conclusion, although I haven't read the original novel, this film has piqued my curiosity as it certainly feels like a story that would be better on paper than on screen. There's only so much that technology can produce before that sense of realism is severed from the audience. Despite this, the film is still worth seeing for those wanting a relatively laid-back adventure involving a dog and his master. If you're someone who loves dogs just as much as me, then this is the film for you.I rate it 7/10",The Call of the Wild

The classic story of a man and his dog is heartwarming to watch, but ""The Call Of The Wild"" features too much CGI animals for my liking. Are there no more real dogs in Hollywood? I get that you want to protect animals but make the CGI animals act like real animals. Harrison Ford gives a pleasant and moving performance but the CGI'd Buck steals the show. I think those familiar with the novel will enjoy this take, but otherwise it's worth a watch in these dark times.

63,daisukereds,Good!,8,6 October 2020,"Book aside, it's a well-done bittersweet story.
It has the kind of characters and situations you can't help but immediately like. It's pretty cheerful and mellow (most of the time). Lovely locations and interesting scenes. It moves fast and doesn't really meander.. and what it wants to say, it shares cleanly.Would have liked a longer version in this world!! Easy recommendation to most kind of people.",The Call of the Wild
64,happipuppi13,Did You Know This Is Brilliant Remake?,10,15 March 2020,"Yes, for those that may not know it , (The) Call Of The Wild was actually a Charlton Heston movie made in 1972 ....48 years ago. He was given complete creative control, which may be part of the reason why it;s not well remembered.Flash forward to today, 9 years and almost 7 months later ....and I went to see it in the theater. With Harrison Ford taking the Heston role and taking it to a level that is genuinely human and humane. If you are expecting any signs of Han Solo or Indiana Jones here , boy are you in the wrong theater.Harrispn, for a good part of the early picture is seen a few times but each time, is an interaction with Buck. His character is John Thornton , a man who left his family and ran off to Alaska because he could not deal with the contentious relationship between him and his son. Ford plays a man of his age, long white hair, moustache and beard and a tired , thin & haggard appearance. Still , his character is a strong one but hurting inside. His performance is nothing short of thruth and utter sincerity , in acting out and displaying very real emotions.The Call of the Wild was and still is is a short adventure novel by Jack London, published in 1903 and set in Yukon, Canada, during the 1890's Klondike Gold Rush, when strong sled dogs were in high demand. The central character of the novel is a dog named Buck. Who is kidnapped from his owners and sold to become a sled dog.To make the story entertaining (for lack of a better word) Buck and many of the dogs and animals, are in part, CGI and given very subtle human qualities and traits but these actions also serve to show how they react as the natural animals they are in real life. There are moments using this , meant to be humorous but kept to a minimum, so this doesn't become too much of a comedy. It ""is"" a perfect mixture of the humorous and rgw serious.In using this. we see Buck goes from a spoiled young dog wreaking havoc in his comfy home , to ending up far away and having to do what he's told to survive. Essentially, he may discover the inner wild dog of his ancestors.Also here , for a great part of the film are Omar Sy & Cara Gee, who are in charge of the sled dog team that helps get the mail through (snow, blizzards, ice and other dangers) to the people in the awaiting towns that are expectng to hear and wrote back to their loved ones. Many or all of then=m are up there trying to seek a fortune in gold. They make a new dog out o Buck, with his new task in life.After them is Buck's next 'human' (played by Beauty and The Beast's Dan Stevens. He plays the horrible , impatient, ill tempered Hal. He treats Buck and the other sled dogs (and his companions) like less than dogs , Thornton catches him about to take them all into disaster but Hal wont listen , his mind too much on himself and his quest for gold.(I'll stop there as I don't want to spell out the entire film here.) Let's just say in his own way, Hal brings Thornton and Buck together as kindred spirits.As stated above , The Call of The Wild , is a mixture of the serious and the humorous but also in it's own simple way , goes just deep enough into the hearts and souls of humans and animals , to see that they both have them and both , when given the challenge , can become better than they thought they knew. (In the case of Hal and other not so nice characters , not everybody comes to that revelation.)The special effects used , are used to move the story forward (and in some cases make it pretty exciting too) and make places and events look perfectly real. No one's acting is boring and no one's acting is over the top or followed by some cheesy line. Everyone jere did a wonderful job.Ten stars , no less. A movie that brilliantlygives us the nature of the animals
and the nature of the human beast (be they a good Beast or not) *END*",The Call of the Wild
65,nightroses,A children's version,4,23 August 2021,"I've been binge watching ""Call of the Wild"" films, and this one is the most watered down designed for kids. I understand this. A good story can be made gentle like this. I found the CGI a bit over-the-top and it might've been better to use real animals but I suppose they needed animated animals because it's easier. They wouldn't have to train them or worry about expressions. Still the ""stunts"" of the animated dog saving an animated wolf by going Super hero was very silly. This kind of cartoonish element makes the film cheesy and unreal. They altered bits of the story too and made it less scary, such as the gold diggers who didn't drown in ice water but survived, including the other sled dogs, and Hal becoming the baddie and killer of Thornton instead of Native Americans. They also made one of the couriers a woman, to make it inclusive I guess, and it didn't really work. There was no death of Spitz the evil dog except he turned tail and left once Buck got the better of him. It was a nice cabin in the woods, unfortunately burned down, and Harrison Ford was amazing as Old Man playing Thornton.",The Call of the Wild

The call of the wild is based on a classic novel of the same name from 1903 and is based on a mischievous dog who gets selfish fully taken away from his owners to work in the arctic to help people mine for gold vie a sled. But after Buck's sled team is deported back to Canada, he finds a grieving old man called John Thornton (Harrison Ford) who wants to go on the travels his son never got to do. Wow what a lovely and heart-warming movie the call of the wild was. So many good things to talk about so let's just get straight to it.First of all the film had a fantastic soundtrack and fantastic cinematography/CGI. Wow the films soundtrack was truly beautiful. Making you feel all the intended emotions that were required with each scene. It made you feel tense, emotional and it really just made you appreciate the film a lot more. The film was also visually fantastic. The scenery of the arctic was beautiful, and to add the northern lights on top of this it was just stunning to watch and they really took there time with some scenes to allow the scenery to sink in which I really appreciated. The CGI was great as well. Yes it was distracting at first not having any real dogs, but after a little while you got used to it, and the dogs needed to be CGI as there faces were much more emotive therefore making you connect with them more.My next few positives would be the dogs. They truly made this movie, each and every dog especially in the pack in the first half had a identifiable personality which I have never really seen before so I really liked this, and they were all very cute which helped as well. What I also liked throughout is that they made you really care and root for all the dogs throughout. The amount of awful situations that they were all put in you couldn't but care for the dogs and want for them to succeed, and they did it all through the perspective of the dogs which I appreciated as well. And the star of the film Buck was fantastic, if I knew a dog like Buck I would never leave it. He was fun and mischievous, but also brave, loyal and willing to sacrifice his own life for his pack and owners showing a true leader, I also liked the added plot point of Buck having a guardian Wolf that looked out for him in a time of need and was his motivation to make the right decisions.My only two slight little grievances would be that the villain could have been slightly better and they could have had more satisfying endings for some of the characters. Dan Stevan's performance was perfectly fine. But for me slightly to over the top, he just didn't really fit in with the desired tone of the movie so therefore felt out of place. He set up good conflict with the characters and you were made to dislike him, but his motivations for doing the things he did were slightly weak. And the end despite being satisfying for Buck could have been slightly better for some of the other characters. Just little things like his pack that he was leading left about halfway through and they weren't reunited. I felt as if the post office workers could of come back, and that Harrison Ford's character could have had some more closure with his ex-wife or son.My next two positives are the films likeable characters and heart-warming tone. The film just had lovely characters that you could connect to, and an equal amount of likeable humans to dogs. As well as Buck and his dogs. Harrison Ford's character was very likeable, at first he was a drunk grieving the death of his son but as his relationship with Buck developed he stopped drinking and became a really caring and funny character and his connection with Buck was very sweet and believable. I also really liked the two sled post office workers played by Cara gee and Omar SY. They were incredibly charming. And showed immense kindness to the dogs that made them instantly likeable and you could believe the bond between them. This led to the whole film being incredibly heartwarming. This tone was well executed throughout. As the bonds between the humans and the dogs increased so did your love for the characters. And the fact that Buck was so willing to do whatever it took to save people was truly nice to see.My final two positives would be the films humour and emotional weight. This film balanced its different tones perfectly with its humour being executed very well. Buck was a very cheeky and mischievous character that you couldn't help but fall in love with. You could tell what he was thinking which made it even more funny. So whether it was refusing to move when he didn't want to do something or wanting to be in the same tent as his owner Buck bought a lot of humour to the movie that was very infectious. It also balanced its heart-warming and emotional tones very well to. This film was fairly emotional in places as Harrison Ford's character was very sadly killed off, but it was done in such a peaceful and raw way as he knew Buck had found his home and that he could be with his son, so the film handled all of its tones and emotions very well.Overall Call of the wild could have had more satisfying endings for some of the characters, But it is a funny, heart-warming, emotional and beautifully crafted movie that any dog lover will enjoy more then you will expect to.",The Call of the Wild
67,jakethesnake-42007,The cgi is awful,3,8 April 2021,A complete mess from start to finish. This movie makes me mad cause it could of been so much more and instead it's a cgi mess. Most of the failures in this film go to the over use of the cgi it's so mad it's laughable. The story is another fault it's not good and it tries so hard to be good. Even the acting is bad. It's a bad bad Bad movie.,The Call of the Wild
68,msunando,Destination unknown,8,12 April 2020,"The Call of The Wild - if you are in the mood for some fun, adventure and pure emotional bonding, give this movie based on the original novel by Jack London, made yet again. At the heart of the story is Buck, and the narrative chronicles him after he's stolen from his home in Santa Clara, California and shipped off to Yukon. The original intent is to sell Buck to the gold rush aspirants, but a turn of events lands him into a pack of sledge dogs owned by Perrault and Francoise who are responsible for delivering mail across Yukon. It is during such mail runs that Buck rediscovers himself, his instincts, strengths, leadership qualities and pays heed to the call of the wild. When his role as the mail dog ends with the advent of the telegraph, Buck is rescued by John Thornton (Harrison Ford), an old man lamenting the untimely death of his son, setting out on a journey of adventure across the mountains, something that his son always wanted to do.The film is an unusual story of Buck's bonding with John as they travel across the beautiful and tough landscape to a destination where the latter will find peace and Buck will return to the wild with a pack of timber wolves, and assume a role of the head of the pack.Exceptional landscapes, including some magnificent shots of the Aurora Borealis adorn the film, and the climax is nothing short of pure gold. Please watch The Call of The Wild and soak yourself in the wonderful creations of mother nature.",The Call of the Wild
69,renegadeviking-271-528568,The CGI Dog talks like Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey,7,30 June 2021,"The Call of the Wild (2020) delivers a refreshing take on Jack London's classic tale. For those who don't know, the film tells the story of a recluse dog named Buck who embarks on an epic adventure after being kidnapped from his comfortable home in the South and brought to the North.This film shines in many ways, with the first being its stellar cast. Harrison Ford stars in the film as distraught outsider John Thornton whom Buck meets during his adventure. Ford brings much of his lovable self back for this film while distinctly embracing his age through his character. His voice-over also works really well, navigating the story as it was told to the viewer.Image result for call of the wild movieOmar Sy (The Intouchables, Jurassic World) also gives a solid performance as head of the sled dog mail team (which is a slight downgrade from training velociraptors in Jurassic World might I add), bringing genuine care and emotion to his interactions with Buck. Karen Gillian (Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Endgame, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle), Bradley Whitford (Get Out), and Michael Horse (Twin Peaks) also perform well in the their limited roles.The crew also does a wonderful job bringing this film to life, beginning at the helm with director Chris Sanders (Lilo and Stitch, How to Train Your Dragon). Sanders, a long time animation director and writer, does wonderfully in his live-action directorial debut as he brings new life to the classic story. Always dependable screenwriter Michael Green (Logan, Blade Runner 2049) pens a tight script that formulates the rather enjoyable (and sometimes emotional) adventure film.Composer John Powell (How to Train Your Dragon, Solo: A Star Wars Story) adds another solid score to his resume with this film, amplifying the adventure through his music. Finally, the CGI in the film is wonderfully done. Buck, as well as all other animals portrayed in the film, are digitally created and exceptionally so. Despite the daunting task, each animal portrayed is believable and their interactions with each other and humans feel authentic in nature.The Call of the Wild (2020) is an enjoyable adventure film for all ages, offering an exciting film-going experience during it's 1 hour and 40 minute run-time. Will you answer when the wild calls?Rating - 8/10.",The Call of the Wild
70,mike-c-b,Should have gone full cartoon or not at all,2,31 October 2020,"Right from the first scene the CGI dog is wrong, and the actors all look fake when they're talking to him.Second thing is, all the actors are trying to be upbeat but the script is depressing, cliche, stagnant, uncreative, no room for improv, etc... so you're looking at soulless people who have been told to ""repeat after me"" with a smile basically.",The Call of the Wild
71,v-56289,expected more...,4,14 May 2021,"I am not really fan of this animation style... Also the narrator wasn't particularly good and the authors manipulated the story too much... The main plot remains, but it's a different story.. Basically, they took out the roughness and replaced by love, thrill, inclusion and personification of animal behaviour... (not that something is wrong about these values... maybe apart the latest one.. but it just makes the message of the movie totally different).At least I expected to see the beautiful Yukon sceneries. But it was also heavily edited.. Just as with the animation, I simply do not like these manipulations... the movie is as fake as instagram profile of a modern day influencer... Yes he is really skilled in using filters, but I just prefer reality and don't see point in following them..",The Call of the Wild
72,theromanempire-1,Entertaining yes but forgettable....,6,26 February 2020,"Unfortunately this was more for little kids and reminded me of the old lassie series and adventures when I was looking to see smg more serious like the eight below movie. unfortunately this was not this case.
first of all the dogs were not real dogs but cgi.
this takes away the magic when we have NO real dogs play in the movie.
maybe this have smg to do with those idiots who always complaint about how we treat animals in the movies and the producers wanted to avoid further troubles.
then like I said before it was more for little kids and the lead ""dog"" was for them mostly.
it's a nice movie to pass your hour u can go watch it but personally I expected more.....",The Call of the Wild

74,zac-04879,A Tedious Adventure Weakened Even More by Laziness,4,5 September 2021,"It's Buck to the rescue... to pretty much everything... Witnessing a heroic dog who frequently demonstrates acts of bravery, resilience and determination will likely be an appealing subject for many families. Plus, the dogs are visually more fascinating simply because they're CGI, and Harrison Ford is part of the tough adventure.However, beautiful visuals are pretty much the only sorts-of-entertaining things in this movie. It's the one and only thing. The Call of the Wild is a weak, boring, cheesy and slow-burning journey, clearly not wasting money, time or popcorn on. To be fair, it's the same pace as the trailers and previews, so enjoying those will probably increase your liking towards this movie.Although many families will reasonably appreciate how the perilous situations are resolved, viewers who've perceived it too many times will find it frequently dumb and very old. It's frequent to the point where it becomes completely and utterly tedious, in case the whole design weren't boring enough already. To be a bit more blunt, the amount of uses of computer animations, alongside the animals, is absolutely lazy.Even Harrison Ford's character overall is weakened by elements that performances do not own any control over. This decent-appearing flick actually turned out as a bland disappointment. It's boring, dull and there wasn't enough effort put in.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",The Call of the Wild

76,itsbobr,Pure Entertainment,10,13 May 2020,"Buck, is an animated CGI dog and this is his story. John Thornton (Harrison Ford) isn't seen on a continuous basis until about 40-minutes into the movie. In the meantime we see all the happenings to Buck before he meets up with John Thornton. Thornton's story is that his son died and he and his wife couldn't cope with the loss and John just wanted to get away and be alone.Buck is kidnapped from a good home run by Judge Miller (Bradley Whitford) who you do not recognize with all that face hair, but his voice gives him away. Buck goes to sled team of Perrault (Amoar Sy) and Francoise ( Cara Gee) who deliver mail to the Yukon. When it is discovered another way to send mail, Perrault and Francoise end their business. Another Sleder Hal (Dan Stevens) buys Buck and is very cruel to him and this is where John Thornton comes on the scene to save Buck.I never read Jack London's The Call of the Wild and I understand this movie is kind of loosely based on it. The landscapes are truly beautiful as is the photography. The banter between Perrault and Francoise is pure gold and you will enjoy them for the time they had Buck.This movie is pure entertainment. You will be amazed at how this CGI dog behaves almost with human thinking and concerns. There is much humor within, but there will be times you will need a box of Kleenex. You will come to believe that this CGI dog is a real dog and maybe a little more than. Buck is a joy and this movie is thoroughly enjoyable.Keep in mind the Animation and Editing that had to go with this story. The Animator and Editor should be given Oscars for Buck's performance.

77,Tcarts76,I was duped. Watch 'Togo' instead.,3,28 March 2020,"If you are going to make a movie about a man and his dog is it too much to ask the film makers to use a REAL dog? The Dog in his scam film is CGI as are other animals...Next on the complte screw over list you give this the title of a mch loved book but then pull a bait and switch with a movie that bears little if any resemblance to the book.Finally, even though I know Harrison Ford is as old as dirt and is phoning in appearances in movies, him being in it duped me into thinking this eas a serious movie.Luckily I didn't pay to see this. I figure the ""family"" movie part was meaning that it would be a bit gritty but mild on the language and turn out to be something more along the lines of Togo.I may just be dumb for judging a book by it's cover here but I believe the title the movie conjures is a deliberate bit of a con anyway. As they type of film that this was I guess it is OK, but I can't give it more than a 3 because if you are going to do a movie with a dog you should use a REAL dog, not CGI. There are millions of dogs out there, and Animal Planet even had a show where people showed the talent of their pets, so finding a real dog is not difficult and they sure are not near extinctions.

80,kingofdanerds,Harrison Ford gives an amazing performance,8,31 December 2020,"For the record, I have not read the 1903 Jack London novel, ""The Call of the Wild"". But with that being said, I am aware that there are several different adaptations of the Jack London novel but I have never seen any of them. Perhaps if I have read the book at some point, I might have. But the 2020 version is the first adaptation I have seen. Produced by 20th Century Studios (previously 20th Century Fox and is now owned by Disney), this film was a box office bomb. Perhaps it can be tied to the COVID 19 pandemic in the United States which would make sense as this film was released in late February of 2020 and the US shutdown occured in early March. The film did recieve some critical praise but nothing special. The film notably stars Harrison Ford.The film follows a dog named Buck who is kidnapped from his original family. He is then sold to a sled team and then to another group until eventually he gets to Harrison Ford's character. But along the way, he is life starts to change as he is exposed to nature...I remember when this film's trailer came out and I had my reservations about the film. What I noticed was there appeared to be some intense scenes, Harrison Ford, and a CGI motion captured dog. This was something that I bet steered a lot of people away from this film but not enough to make this a box office bomb as I already stated in the first paragraph of this review. With that being said, it is understandable why a CGI dog was used and not a real one especially considering some of the scenes in this film. But that brings up some other points. You could have did a motion capture film instead or even just an animated film. Or, just attempt to go with the live action. In most scenes, the CGI Buck is distracting and that is typically in scenes where there are humans but it looks fine by itself. They portray Buck as a smart dog but it gets to the point where he is too smart and also too expressive. Another thing concerning the trailer. I noticed Harrison Ford was in the film and I assumed he was the main focus or at least one of the main focuses. In this film, he is not given much focus until the last half of the film. Was I disappointed? Only a little. Now, as I already stated, I have not read the Jack London book but I do do my research when it comes to reviewing films. What is most often described is that this movie is a PG movie but the book is somewhere around a PG-13. Considering this is technically a Disney film, I can see why this film is tame in comparison. But I think a version that was more on the same level as the source material could have and probably should have been done. Now the story overall is fine. Sure it is uneven in tone, but overall it is alright. It sees the journey of a dog that is exposed to the harsh real world and where he must learn to survive. It is quite interesting actually. There are some tense scenes in this film which is what the trailer promised. There is a villain revealed and while I don't know if that is the case in the source material, I find it in this film to be quite silly. The ending is sad but I suppose it feels right. The performances in this film are alright but the true star is Harrison Ford who does an amazing job here in this film. He does a great portrayal of a man who has lost his son, succumbed to alcoholism and the character he plays is one who probably needed Buck in his life.The Call of the Wild is a good film. While it might not be on par with the source material (from what my research is telling me) and the CGI is a little distracting, this film has plenty of good things about it.",The Call of the Wild

Sure, it's farfetched but isn't it suppose to be?The three main leads consisting of Omar Sy, Cara Gee, and Harrison Ford were all great in their respective roles. I almost teared up when Buck did his saving heroics through the ice; also when he was gaining confidence as a sled dog.

85,deadbull-95171,Jack London would turn in his grave,1,11 September 2021,"London is one of my favorite authors. Eloquent, brutal, who always has something to say. A great story teller who was in the Klondike, didn't get gold, except by writing about those who made the effort, the vast majority of them failing or dying.There aren't any other writer's that come to mind who can make 2 world famous full length novels told P. O. V. From a dog's brain that can be so compelling to a sophisticated adult readership but there is nothing childish in the sensibilities and intelligence of that great writer. And of course there are the great stories on other topics and the book about his own alcoholism, that killed him by age 40.And now we have this idiotic production. It touches on some points in the novel but is so badly scrambled and miscast it is hard to look at from its first moments if you read any of the literature that it systematically demolishes.The worst miscasting is the central star, Buck, the dog. Buck was not a St. Bernard. He was a full blooded wolf with some husky blood. He was indistinguishable from a wolf, except the Husky genes made him larger and heavier and more ferocious.The movie is semi accurate as it stumbles through Buck's evolution from a spirited domestic dog to a hijacked animal stolen and sold to prospectors gearing up and paying heavy premiums for sled dogs.The movie lamely traces, through the narrations of Harrison Ford, a good 50 years older then the owner Buck wound up with, bucks return to his primordial nature through the savageries imposed on him, and works somewhat with his dormant and suppressed fidelity to mankind if mankind treats him properly.But the brilliance of the writing is completely gone. This dumbed down epic for children has far less integrity the ""Old Yeller"" or ""Lassie"".Combined with ludicrous CGI, and a tired and silly performance by Harrison ford as a primary, and then further befouled by none of the critical secondary personnel in the real story, instead replaced by ""politically correct"" irrelevant incompetents, it adds up to one of the more disappointing adaptations to come along since the Moby Dick things where the CGI whale is now the Size of a Nuclear Aircraft carrier and in fact is now hunted with Nukes.The movie is wildly overrated here, and I give it a one only because it got me to pick up London immediately to remind myself that intelligence still existed in 1898 through 1916 at least, the year the great writer died.Avoid, pass, go the library and get those wonderful books.

If it was another man playing his part it just wouldn't have been as good as it turned out to be. I thought all of the acting was good. The story was a little shaky I thought. The start of the movie wasn't as exciting or as good as a start should be. It didn't really grab your attention right out of the gate. The rest of the story besides besides the villain was solid. I just thought the villain was weak and I couldn't really relate to him that much. Like I said, besides that the story was good. The CGI is something many people are talking about. There was a lot of it in this film. Exceptionally the animals in this film. They looked extremely shiny and cartoonish. There was some really stunning CGI but it wouldn't really feel like they were in the wild. It made me feel like the film is on a stage. They couldn't get me ensured enough to feel like I was actually in the great outdoors. Another thing I enjoyed is the score. It added some of the charm to this film. It was happy and intense when it needed to be. This is the only other film I could think of to use a banjo in its score besides Raising Arizona. I enjoyed that about this film.Overall, The Call Of The Wild was a fun film that I would recommend for families or readers of the book.",The Call of the Wild

88,samyoung-82648,Close to superb,7,6 March 2020,"Short, sharp and sweet. When this film is in its groove, it's superb. It's a work of art.
When it's not, it feels a bit rough.
The main problems with the film fall into two. One, the animation of Buck is fairly rough for the first half of the film. Two, the actress who plays Françoise (Cara Gee) is a very miscast actress. She's arrogant and obnoxious. She belongs at the 2020 Golden Globes.
The standout performance was Omar Sy as Perrault. He had a superb sense of humanty and of humour, rolled into one. He reminded me of Eddie Murphy when he was at his best.
My youngest who read the books was very taken with the film and thought it was brilliant. I would highly recommend this film to any young children who can handle a bit of violence (probably 10 years and over).",The Call of the Wild
89,theredsky,The Call of the Wild Review,6,5 March 2020,"The Call of the Wild is a strange film. All the pieces for a great movie are here but the studio or Director choose to be lazy instead of taking advantage of the opportunity. If you have seen any clips or trailers from this film then you know that they animated a dog instead of using a real dog. It's not just the dog they created in CGI. They did it to every single animal. It's incredibly lazy and distracting. It's not that the animals look bad, it's just uncanny. It looks like a dog and acts like a dog but it doesn't feel like a dog. At certain points within the film, the dog will make ""human expressions"". It feels out of place. The movie feels like it honestly should have been animated. I would have really liked this movie if it had been animated but I wouldn't have loved it. The film still has issues in the character and editing category. Most of the characters in the film were pretty good such as Harrison Ford and Omar Sy but Dan Stevens' performance and character/villain was pretty awful. His performance was so over the top that it was distracting. I normally like over the top performances but this wasn't the kind of over the top I like. His character was pretty awful too. He is supposed to be the main antagonist but he is only in the film for about 5 minutes. He feels more like a plot device than a character. While Steven's character is pretty bad, Ford and Sy's characters were pretty good. Both of their characters were fleshed out and were very likeable. Their performances added to this likeability. Harrison Ford did a great job. I honestly felt that this is one of his better performances in a long time. He brought a lot of depth and vulnerability to his performance and made his character relatable and interesting. Omar Sy did a pretty good job. His performance wasn't on the same level as Ford's but he still was enjoyable to see on screen. The plot of the film and its sequence of events was surprisingly really well done and emotional. The film is fast paced all the way through and the film is able to successfully deliver emotional punches with the human characters but not for the CGI animals. The only issue I took with the structure and sequence of events was how the second half of the film was much better than the first half. The first half of the film has good performances but the plot hasn't fully kicked into gear yet so it's not as interesting. The second half is when Harrison Ford comes in and the film becomes much much better. Most of the film's technical aspects were pretty good too. The cinematography was pretty good for the most part but did have some beautiful establishing shots. The score by John Powell was great and helped add some emotion to certain scenes but the editing wasn't that great. It wasn't terrible but it was noticeably awkward when it transitioned to other scenes. Overall, The Call of the Wild has all the pieces to make a good film but decides to take the lazy route and animate all the animals muting some of the emotional weight.",The Call of the Wild

92,jacksisjax,The smartest human fake cgi dog of all time,4,1 September 2020,"It's not that the story is bad, it's clearly a good story. It's a best selling book. It's the CRAP writing and direction. The horrible set designs. Just the overall poor production choices. Namely the fact that there are no dogs in this movie, a movie about a freaking dog. Every bit of cgi in this movie is absolutely atrocious, and there is an incredible amount of cgi.It's not that it's void of feeling. It's just that anytime you feel something for this dog you feel like an idiot. Because it's just so unbelievably fake and goofy. The cartoonish, unrealistic vibe of this movie ruins any hope for something good. How can you ever hope to immerse yourself in something if you don't even believe in it. How can you hope to connect with something that you don't believe in? It's different with cartoons and animated movies because they know they're not real, but this movie takes itself to seriously. The writer genuinely thinks dogs are like this, or at least he writes like he does.Lol this dog knows the dangers of alcohol. That's how unbelievable this is.Also side note (not that it matters): the antagonist of this movie makes no sense at all. He came out of nowhere and his motives weren't even fleshed out. This foo traveled in the forest for weeks maybe months, just to get revenge on a guy who gave him good advice?!How confusing and stupid was that?!In short: this is a kids movie.

Cameo from Karen Gillan who in the film for about 5 mins but the main star Harrison Ford do i really need to tell you, Incredible actor that brought the emotional heart felt to the film with moments that will melt you heart with the special bond with Buck.This would have never been the same film if they didnt make Buck CGI, because the incredible animation on Buck give him this lovable, courageous Dog with a big heart, you could away tell what buck was thinking with the facial expression the way his eye would look when he was thinking just incredible, its this lovable character you fall in love with straight away from start to finish.The amazing music and back drop of the mountain ranges and beautiful forest give the film this beautiful visuals that really adds to the beautiful made film, that will make you laugh, feel emotional and bring you to tear in a beautiful told adventure film of a dogs journey to find his true calling.A film i highly recommend watching if you a dog lover or love these type of adventure film it wont disappoint.Dislikes: Some may find the back story of why Harrison ford character is their, while it doesnt really effect the film because the film is more about buck, some might find that a direction.Overall: Incredible heart felt amazing journey of a dog with big heart and personality that will melt you heart.",The Call of the Wild

Only how it compares to the rest of the children films this year and this decade. It made me laugh and and cry. It made me happy and sad. It was everything I wanted from a family film and more. You follow the journey of a loveable dog that speaks more volumes than any talking animal disney can offer. You watch with incredible visuals and exceptional music that makes it all breathtaking. So much happens in this film. And i feel privileged to watch it. Highly recommended.,The Call of the Wild
98,trevorwomble,Actually a decent movie,7,8 March 2020,"I went into this with a certain sense of dread as the trailer seemed to show a very shonky CGI dog. However fear not, as the final product is actually pretty good and I can only assume the trailer was cut from an early rendering of Buck by the animators.This is a pretty good film actually if you can get over the fcat that CGI was used for not just the dog scenes but things like an avalanche etc. All well done and it is quite understandable why CGI was used as it was the only way to solve certain problems with such a lavish adventure story.The film zips along at a decent pace and is perfectly acceptable for children around 8 years old and above. It also holds together well enough for adult viewers. There are some genuinely amusing moments in the film that brought laughter from the audienceand although there is some minimal violence, which there has to be if it is to follow the source novel to any degree of accuracy, it is all handled well. I also agree with the reviewer who said that Harrison Ford's casting holds the film together. His world weary narration as well as his grizzled, hard drinking but very human adventurer helps give the film some much needed pathos. For a man pushing 80 in real life he brings a certain degree of gravitas to this film.So to summarise, this is a decent adaptation of the classic novel. There is very little to offend younger viewers and it is also quite gripping in parts. The CGI is much better than was seen in the trailer and both Omar Sy and Harrison Ford put in decent performances even though the dog is the star. A film that doesn't insult its audience and definitely worth a watch .",The Call of the Wild

If you can't connect with the dog in your dog then you have a really big problem.Harrison Ford is okay, he seems to be trying so that's nice.The direction is pretty standard, but the cinematography looks decent, even beautiful at times.Overall I can't really recommend it.

This is not only a remake of an already existing film, but it is plagued with unnecessary CGI that looks obvious and is incredibly distracting. Those two elements are put together to make a film that is, while admittedly serviceable, ultimately the product of a corporation/company, not an artist. Harrison Ford always does a good job and at times the movie is heartwarming, but it's also cheesy and at times even boring.Am I just out of touch or is this just the norm for film nowadays?",The Call of the Wild

I am not an expert when it comes to the technical aspects of film but when you use CGI for all the animals in a movie and they look poorly done then you shouldn't be proud of the final product. Not only that but there were even some scenes where the CGI around the humans was poorly done and you could see the rough edges around them. Another problem I had was the pacing of the film felt extremely awkward. There are essentially 3 chapters to the movie the first being when Buck is with his first family, then when he becomes a sled dog, and lastly with John Thorton/Harrison Ford. The pacing of these all felt rushed and crammed together which makes sense considering the film isn't even two hours. But they should've spent more time on each or cut one of these subplots out. My biggest issue however was when Thorton and Buck wander off into the wild with no map and Hal (the villain) is able to track them to the random cabin that they stumble upon and he conveniently has a map that takes him directly to this cabin. This film misses the mark on many levels for me and I was very disappointed in it.",The Call of the Wild

Buck is crafted as a dog of pure heart, and the film makes sure the audience knows by constant scenes in which he goes out of his way to help others, even putting himself at risk. I could really empathize with the dog. The conflict is solid in the movie, either with the gold-hunter, the former dog leader or, simply, the challenges of nature.
Buck's arch is also solid and gradual. It feels very natural, and it is emotive.It feels a little episodic when the 'mailmen' have to get rid of the dogs all of a sudden, almost as if the plot needed it to happen, and then the switch to what feels like a slightly different story with Buck and Harrison Ford's character on their journey.

It does look good but we are a few years away from being able to create 100% convincing CG animals and characters in movies.The scenery is really beautiful at times with majestic snowy mountains and crystal clear rivers and lakes, i don't know how much CG was used for the background but it does look very nice.It's just an enjoyable, stress free family movie with a nice story and likeable characters.I'm nearly 40 and i liked it.",The Call of the Wild
113,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,A Call of the Not So Wild,7,25 February 2020,"*Majestic wolf howls in the background* Welcome back to Stream To Big Screen! This week we were able to review the new version of the often adapted Jack London classic, The Call of the Wild. If you haven't read the book in a while or just don't remember, the book is about a dog named Buck who against all odds makes it through the roughest parts of the Yukon to find his true calling in the wild (skipping a bunch of key part and oversimplifying).Now, let's get this straight. This Movie Does Not Follow the Book! Do Not Take Your Child to See This Movie Instead of Them Reading the Book. They Will Get a ""c-"" at Best. They Will Have the Gist of The Book but Not the Correct Details. Now let's get to the review of this movie.Twentieth Century Fox Animation and Twentieth Century Fox brought us this latest version and I must say as far as animation goes, it was the star. The film looks bright and crisp. The scenery is quite immersive. I almost know what it feels like to actually ride on a dog sled. Speaking of dog sleds, the animation with the dogs is sometimey. I'll admit most of the time the animation portrays the dog's emotions and expressions flawlessly. The other part of the time I feel like I'm watching a cartoon, a la Garfield, Scooby Doo animation. Quite frankly, it's off-putting. I wanted to forget that I was watching CGI creatures but the quality of these effects just kept on reminding me (I'm looking at you mystic wolf). Now, this same aspect I'm sure kids wouldn't even mind.Kids also won't mind that this movie is almost too light. This book has some very heavy scenes and themes but this movie approached those same concepts in the lightest way possible. The PG rating handcuffed the producers almost too much. I understand they were producing this for a younger audience, but they may have gone too light for this classic. The PG rating definitely influenced how closely this movie could come to the true spirit the literary piece of work.Long story short, The Call of the Wild is an American middle school reading classic adapted to the big screen a few times. This movie has been updated with all the dog-loving CGI you can handle. This movie will be perfect for the classroom for kids but just worth a matinee visit for the family to the theater.",The Call of the Wild

However, this new adaptation based on London's beloved novel It really works beautifully. When I first heard about this new adaptation I was very excited about it and as soon as I heard Buck wasn't going to be a real dog instead has been replaced by a CGI one! I was so bummed down! Knowing that I decided to give it a try and I went see it with an open heart because Jack London's stories are heartfelt soulful. I was not disappointed at all. Beautiful family/adventure. Many moviegoers had a say about the CGI Buck being a distraction and, I know, I get it! But, it was not the case for me. Yes, having been replaced By CGI dog gives many opportunities to manipulate storytelling and so what! It was nicely done. No violent scenes and harsh telling and in spite of that still, it was captured the essence of this beloved novel. Harrison Ford was really great as John Thornton and Buck the CGI DOG charming and a winner.",The Call of the Wild
115,helenbassett,The Call Of The Wild Film Review - Chris Sanders Directs Harrison Ford & Omar Sy In A Charming Shaggy Dog Story,10,8 March 2020,"Buck is a naughty puppy in The Call Of The Wild who enjoys his Californian life of leisure. He's never seen snow, until a dognapping sees him trafficked north, to the frozen Yukon and the Klondike Gold Rush, where strong dogs are in demand. Chris Sanders directs a CGI epic with Harrison Ford joining Buck on his journey to the wild.Cara Gee's Françoise with Omar Sy's Perrault are the lovely French-Canadian postal team in the frozen wild, and Buck is bought by Perrault to complete his dog sled team. Our St Bernard is no husky and being at the back of the sled he isn't so much a team player either, more keen to independently explore his new surroundings. But Perrault explains to him they are all tied together, if he goes they all go. A salutary lesson for the spoilt family dog. But Buck has a black wolf spiritual guide in these wild Indian territories, and he's keen to learn. And when an opportunity comes to lead the sled team, the vicious aptly named husky Spitz is challenged, and loses. With Buck their new leader the sled carries the mail lickety-split, finally on time, as the Northern Lights dance among them.Originally written by Jack London in 1903, and with the story narrated by Harrison Ford, the film is an enjoyable trek with Buck guided by his spirit to safety across the frozen land. At times I even felt emotional over the shaggy CGI dog story, especially when Dan Stevens takes on the team. His mad eyed adventurer Hal is willing to risk the safety of everyone, especially his new team of dogs, for the lure of gold. Flogging them onwards as the snow turns to mud, and the frozen ice starts to crack.Harrison Ford's character is a great one for him, his John Thornton is a grieving father who chooses to live alone, a shaggy dog himself, but he finds something in Buck's companionship that grounds him. I don't know how closely the film follows the book, but Buck also gives John the courage to give up his drinking, and finally take the road less travelled. The unexplored wilderness where his late son suggested there could be gold. And it is so plentiful that Buck can just nose along the river bed and pick up nuggets as big as his head. But we've all seen Wall-E and his diamond... Still there's enough there to buy groceries for a lifetime and even a railroad. If that's what John wanted.But what Buck wants is to explore. With a gorgeous white timber wolf. It's such a great film for kids with emotional moments, comedy and pure happiness as Buck explores how close he is to the wild, and eventually finds his wild side. Sorry if that's a spoiler! Long forgotten is the Californian easy life.I know critics have criticised the film's CGI, but if this wilderness is all CGI then it's a beautiful job by the team. Cinematography was by Janusz Kaminski, with Buck played in motion-capture by Terry Notary. And I bet the CGI animals were easier to control than real ones. You couldn't have created this film without them, okay action! 'pop your head up out of the snow just after Fido'. But they came at a CGI price.I guess The Call Of The Wild is a boy's own story, but there was plenty for girls to enjoy too, right from the naughty antics of Buck's early life, well you know that laden picnic table was just asking for it. Great fun for all.",The Call of the Wild

Disney's digital animation (and of course, they are partners with Pixar, who are pros at this stuff), is leaps and bounds better!! Lion King? Very realistic (not perfect). Jungle Book? Very realistic (not perfect). But The Call of the Wild couldn't have been more fake looking. Worse, they opted to use the fake dog in a few scenes with real dogs, which made it even LESS real (if that were possible).Not for one second of one scene in this movie did I every forget I was watching digital animation.I'd give it a 3.4 out of 10 (in fairness to the movie makers, my rating is half of what others give it), but I truly think it was horrible. Would it be good for 5 year olds (who MIGHT believe it was a real dog)? In all honesty, NO.. because it's really NOT a family story.",The Call of the Wild
122,a_sad_cow,Not what Jack London intended,5,24 May 2021,"It's been many years since I read Jack London's version, but a couple key points stood out that this movie starkly contradicted. Namely, that there is a point in life where the brutality of nature is revealed, and it behooves one to respect that nature and respond in kind.The minor rewrites are forgivable. The personality of Buck's first sled dog crew aren't exactly crucial to Buck's overall character development, so whatever new stuff they want to write in...well, whatever. Where they really screwed the pooch was skipping the fight where the alpha beat the challenger by going for the throat. If there's anything I remember from the book, it's going for the throat. Literally. Buck learned hard from this, and it's how he originally became the alpha.Overall I enjoyed this, but it fell well short of what it could have been. This really should've been rated G, but I was hoping the whole ""PG"" bit was in keeping with the old school rating system. Great film for the kiddos, and the dumbing down of nature probably won't have the Beethoven effect - i.e. Parents are still highly unlikely to adopt wolves due to their cuddly nature in this film. Still, probably at least one though. Hooray for social justice...for dogs....or whatever.",The Call of the Wild

Review:
Call of the Wild is a terrific way to spend 1 hour and 40 minutes any day of the week. It has a good story line, costumes and breath taking scenery.
I would happily watch this film over and over again. There should be more movies like this that hold your interest and put a smile on your face!
This movie is an adventure-experience!

128,gcarpiceci,A Plastic Movie,3,3 March 2020,"I can understand a wide use of CGI for a sci-fi movie: space-ships, aliens, remote stars, etc are hardly available for filming; same for dinosaurs and similia. But for God's sake, The Call Of The Wild features forests, woods, snow and dogs...dogs! Why does one need an ordeal of CGI to film such things? Why does one need to create a fake, digital dog (and the wrong one, at that)? One has to wonder how cinema could exist before the invention of CGI....
As if this were not enough, we are then forced to watch a classic of literature bent to the needs of having a Disney family movie...
The last touch of this hall of shame which is The Call Of The Wild is that Buck, our hero CGI'd dog, acts like a human. Yes, the dog which is called back to his wild roots, the dog which undertakes this epic journey from human civilisation to the wilderness of the woods, is made look like a human being. The director could not find a better way to give a dog its own dignity than to make him act and look like a human being, the very same acting like beasts in the very same movie....how more stupid can human being be?",The Call of the Wild
129,amexspam,The computer generated Harrison Ford was Excellent!,10,26 February 2020,"As you all know, the scenery and all of the actors in this movie were computer (CGI) generated - even Ford's voice was created by modifying Siri's algorithm. In fact the only live creature you see on the screen in the entire movie is the dog. Truly the dog's performance was incredible since he was reacting to a blue screen and voice commands from the director Alexa. I'm wondering why they should bother using real people at all in movies - any anywhere else for that matter. Ten Stars!!!",The Call of the Wild
130,thomasmitilis1995,"I KNEW HIM ONCE, WHEN HE WAS JUST A DOG AT A MEN SIDE...",5,5 May 2020,"PROS:
~Harrison Ford gives a solid performance and his character brings humanity into the film. The interaction between him and the dog is heartwarming and their friendship feels true. Like Buck he tries to find his true place in the world.
~The introduction of Buck in a new way of life and his attempt to be a part of pack are strong elements of the film. His overall narrative is an adventure of self-discovery and finding of his true nature.
~Omar Sy gives a charming performance and the first act when he is the leading human actor gives the viewer interesting moments (the segment in the lake, the avalanche sequence etc.)
~The music is joyful and some sceneries are beautiful (especially the green color of Northern Lights).CONS:
~The CGI of Buck (and the other dogs) is awful. His facial expressions and movements bring to mind more of a human rather than a real animal. It isn't so noticeable when he interacts with other animals but in the more intimate scenes between the dog and the human, a real dog would be a better choice.
~In some points the dog thinks and acts like a human such as when he takes the liquor of Ford's character away.
~Dan Stevens as the villain of the movie is really annoying and how his character plays into the plot feels a bit forced. He is one-dimensional and way over the top and his overall appearance (mustache and clothes) makes him seem like a cartoon rather than a real human being. And wtf with the presence of Karen Gillan?
~The black wolf is supposed to represent the wild instincts of Buck but this symbolism feels easy and pretentious.",The Call of the Wild

138,michaeldoud,"First Hit: I was very distracted by the computer-generated dog, Buck, that acted more like a human than a dog, therefore, I missed the power of the story.",4,23 February 2020,"First Hit: I was very distracted by the computer-generated dog, Buck, that acted more like a human than a dog, therefore, I missed the power of the story.This film is based on the great Jack London short novel of the same name. From the moment we meet Buck, his looks and mannerisms reflect the humanization of the dog. Being a dog owner, I really disliked this. Reading into a dog's eyes and looks to reflect our human emotions is a fantasy I don't particularly like.Basically, the story goes that Buck is stolen from his owner Judge Miller (Bradley Whitford), in Santa Clara, CA. While with the Judge, Buck had the run of Miller's home, and the opening scenes we see him eating whatever food he can find, and then he ruins a whole table full of food, by sampling or eating more food than a dog, of that size, could ever eat.Now stolen from his home, Buck is shipped to Alaska and meets John Thornton (Harrison Ford), who is grumpy but sees something in Buck he likes and gives a wry smile.Buck is purchased by the mail delivery team of Perrault (Omar Sy) and Francoise (Cara Lee). Although Buck is a huge dog, he's out of his element because Perrault and Francoise are dog sled mail delivery workers, and Buck has never been a working dog and knows nothing about snow or being a sled pulling dog. He's been a home dog.Buck is mystified by the snow and then becomes demoralized after being hooked up to a harness and asked to pull a sled led by other computer-animated dogs. He does his best but, in a human way, makes mistakes.But CGI Buck decides to become the best dog in the team, which comes across as another human aspect. The lead dog appreciates Bucks's efforts (more human emotions), but the entire movie audience knows what is coming, a confrontation with the lead husky.This confrontation ultimately ends up in glory for Buck, Perrault, and Francois, but as the story would have it, Buck gets sold again to a greedy miner Hal (Dan Stevens) who wants to find gold. He and Thorton get into it, and bad blood arises over Hal's treatment of Buck.Buck escapes Hal, finds Thornton, and they walk together into the wilderness, the call of the wild sort of speak.Together they create an excellent partnership. Upon arriving at a remote cabin, they set up shop, and Buck starts to flirt with and hang out with timberwolves. Of course, there is one final predictable confrontation with Hal, and we all know what will happen.There are lovely and poignant moments, and they mostly revolve around Thornton's grumpy demeanor and Buck's loving, caring way.Not being able to forget just how humanized Buck was made to be, the film's real story about self-redemption and following your dream, was left on the cutting room floor.Ford was terrific as John Thornton, a man who was still mourning the loss of his son. Sy was great and engaging as Perrault, the sled driver. Gee was excellent as Perrault's co-sled team driver. Michael Green wrote this screenplay. There wasn't anything wrong with the screenplay, but the execution of the CGI dog just failed the film. Chris Sanders did a reasonable job of directing this story, but the CGI hurt the effort, and Sanders is part to blame because he allowed too much humanization of Buck.Overall: This was a difficult film to watch because it seemed too made up.",The Call of the Wild

Or, watch the film if you love ""Disney"" movies. It's that simple. For the record, I did NOT read the book and I'm tired of reviews that rate a film based on it's likeness to a fiction book. They are different, viewers are warned that they are different, and it's fiction based on fiction.

143,Camelot_2000,An OK Adaptation Of A Highly Praised Historical Author,5,1 March 2020,"I saw this yesterday at the theatre with my aunt and admit, I was entertained by the modern day version of the Jack London story. I remember reading the book as a kid and was grandly entertained about the hero canine, Buck, and his journey to find out where he truly wanted to belong.I admit it was a nostalgic experience seeing this film at the theater. It brought back memories of reading the story as a teen and also made me feel nostalgic about seeing the legendary Harrison Ford on the big screen again. I remember the first big screen experience with him was when the 1st Star Wars film came out. I saw it in the summer of 1977 at a theatre in downtown Edmonton, Alberta.I admit it's not the perfect story though. Too much obvious CGI and cartoon antics take way the gripping historical accuracy of the book. The CGI of Buck the dog though was totally well detailed and well done. He seemed like a real dog after awhile and one you could feel sympathy and concern for. He was well depicted.Harrison Ford is the real weight to the film though with his gruff and tender narration and performance as John Thornton, a man haunted and pained by the death of his son. He's a well seasoned actor with the capability of bringing strong magnetism to a film. He's totally captured that trait here. A real pro.John and Buck both have troubled pasts, but they eventually get together and go onto a journey seeking self discovery and a sort of resolution for what they endured in their lives. They learned where they destinies laid.This is not the best film, but a good one nonetheless. Modern day political correctness is made into play here with a ""Disney"" touch to it all, taking away the impact of the original Jack London Story. A decent flick though with a lot of heart. I highly recommend it.",The Call of the Wild

147,kmjnhh123,Doggo's Adventure,7,2 March 2020,"Didn't see any trailers for this film really so i guess the budget wasn't that high, so i saw it going through the Cineworld app & gave it a watch.I felt like the film was in 2 halves, the first half was about Doggo luxury & spoilt life & how he then became tricked into a cage & then how doggo ended up having a much different life. Well after doggo gets captured he ends up in the cold mountains & becomes a snow doggo that pulls the sleigh for the mail delivery, but throughout this he goes through some pain, heartbreak some sad moments. But doggo is soon on his feet as the sleigh puller, but as doggo is way more stronger than the current leader husky dog, they end up having a fight for the lead dog & doggo becomes out on top. But at this point Harrison Ford has been rarely seen in the film as he comes in on the 2nd part o the film, so after doggo getting back on his feet the mail run suddenly comes to a end & doggo is left with no purpose yet again.Then these rich people come & buy all the sleigh dogs but Harrison Ford doesn't like that & saves doggo from the evil rich people which then starts the 2nd phase of the film, Harrison doesn't know what to do with doggo so they go on a adventure down the mountains to find the gold, but doggo ends up finding a pack of wolves & he actually wants to be with the wolf pack but still likes being with Harrison.The CGi was good, couldn't fault any bad CGi from the dog side & it was nice to see a non talking dog film for once. The film was defiantly more focused on the feeling aspect of the dogs & what they had to go through rather than it being a lovable cute doggo film. Yea you could of picked the film apart in a few places but don't take the film seriously in that way, it was just a good watch & apparently a remake of the old version? I didn't know a original existed & won't be watching the original if there is one.Kids might like it because of the dogs but might get a bit boring at points for them so i would say its a mixed age film rather than for one audience.Age - 25

BeethovenThis is a 2020 family film loosely based on the novel of Jack London by the same name. It's about a dog's journey from to the American north and it's transformation from a playful house pet into an instinctive and ""wild"" sled dog during the Klondike Gold Rush. It is your typical family adventure/comedy/drama film, and while there are quite a bit of clichés, it is still pretty enjoyable for both kids and parents. I really liked how, at times, they could tell a full blown complex story without any words (the animals in the film don't talk); and the CGI (of the scenery, not the dogs) is honestly breathtaking, making it into an epic big-screen picture which I didn't expect from a film like that.Exciting, funny, spectacular, but don't expect it to be an actual homage to Jack London's work.

150,npdeo18,A CGI FILLED EMOTIONAL DRAMA,7,20 February 2020,"Outside Star Wars & Indiana Jones, it's been a long time Harrison Ford has had a success at the box office. Call of the Wild may be his last outing as a leading man at the box office if we put aside the reputed franchises.
Adapted from the novel written by Jack London, it tells the story of a pampered dog who is kidnapped and sold in the market, after which he experiences hardships and yearns for a freedom in the midst of the Alaskan Gold Rush held in 1890s.
Harrison Ford as an alcoholic along with its supporting cast gives an earnest performance with its CGI of its location and the dog being the highlight of the film especially the scenes in which buck endures the separation at different stages was quite emotional. The only drawback of the film was its slow second half which affected the pace of the film at the end.Overall this film would be acclaimed by critics but doubts may come over its box office success despite its positive review.

For me, it felt like they perfected a balance where the animals can be expressive without looking weird or terrible. Sure there are some moments when Buck acts too human, but it wasn't as bad as people were making it out to be. A film that did it terribly was Dolittle.The score is John Powell's best music to date. Enough said.The cinematography is probably my favourite element in the film, shot by the amazing Janusz Kaminski. Not only are the shots pause-worthy but the color grading is just........AMAZING. It also helps in making the CGI look more realistic.Like I mentioned before, the direction by Chris Sanders is great. I loved How to Train your Dragon and The Croods and seeing him work with Disney again is a sight for sore eyes.The only negatives in the film is that some of the characters feel brushed over, like Dan Stevens's character (his character felt too one-dimensional despite an good performance.) and the final battle felt kind of rushed, but apart from that, that's about it.So if you get the chance to either rent or buy this film, I think you should do so.",The Call of the Wild

The movie also features stunning cinematography, with several beautiful shots and camera angles. It's a true joy to look at. However, there are a few problems with the movie. For starters, John Thornton narrates a lot throughout the movie, despite not being present for, and therefore having no way of knowing about, the events that he's describing. Another issue is Dan Stevens' character; Hal. Hal is an entirely unnecessary, one dimensional antagonist, who just doesn't work with the story this movie is trying to tell.

What we have is a welcome departure from the totally over-the-top, 'here we go again', blockbuster action movie that Hollywood regurgitates over and over lately.
Harrison Ford delivers as he always does. In fact, all the cast give excellent performances.
The star, of course, is the dog.
And, of course it's a CGI dog. You can't get a real dog to perform everything 'Buck' has to endure!

The cinematic scenery is breathtaking.

This isn't the first time Jack London's tale has had a rework, and each time it fails miserably because it captures none of the hardship, cruelty, heroism, gallantry and endurance of the original. Clearly, this has been made with money in mind, and profit, over sticking to the integrity of the plot.The vicious aggression of Spitz and his final commuppance at the jaws of Buck is gone.

The story line is good, and the graphics are... well, kinda good/bad. It was intriguing to see how a digitally, graphically engineered dog was incorporated into live situations. It's movements were not exactly on que to be believable, and watching the movie seemed to cause preoccupation on that lack of believability of the dog rather than the story line. I wish they had used a real dog, I would have given it a 9 or 10 star rating. This was a great endeavor I think on the part of the producers, but a failure in giving the viewer a believable movie. The digital dog obscured the joy of the movie and just about the time you began to get into it, the fake dog would bring you back to reality!

Buck was well animated and carried the film throughout. The film did a great job job in charting Buck's journey while still trying to stick to a short run time. I enjoyed Harrison Ford a lot, but his character definitely brought the pace of the whole movie down. This is a good family film for 8+ yr old kids and their parents/grandparents to go to. -8 yr old kids may not be able to appreciate it as much. A truer adaptation of the great book by Jack London remains to be made and this will have to do for now.",The Call of the Wild

169,Davor_Blazevic_1959,A classic novel well-altered... especially for the younger ones,9,23 February 2020,"Before writing anything about the film itself let it be noted following.(1) Screenplays are usually related to source materials (works of fiction or documentary depictions of factual events and experiences) with the phrase *based on*, which is mostly read as *copied from* (whether a fictitious depiction or reality) although fully faithful account of events and their protagonists almost never happens, so, in all fairness, it might be safer to understand such relation simply as *altered from*.(2) Furthermore, CGI has erased strict distinction between live action and animation, introducing a new method and a whole new form of cinematography by blending realistic imagery and kinematics of existing animals (and other fantastic beasts) with anthropomorphic expressions and gestures given to their stylized representation in the world of animation, a trend probably started in 1970's by ILM servicing Star Wars saga, getting (over)exploited in recent followers of the kind, most notably Disney's The Lion King (2019).That having been said, in the latest take on Jack London's classic novel, screenwriter Michael Green and director Chris Sanders--apparently intentionally not bound by faithfulness to the original text, particularly avoiding its darker overtones, certainly counting with receptiveness from the audience, especially from those (among us) who have read the novel--have succeeded in meeting a great deal of expectations from the film seeking to be labeled with family entertainment attribute.The Call of the Wild is the story of Buck (as main human character, John Thornton, described it), a dog like no other, he'd been spoiled, and he'd suffered, but he could not be broken... Buck's life gets turned upside down during the gold rush of the 1890s, when he was suddenly banished from his home in California and moved, first to Yukon, and then deep into the heart of Alaska, reaching Arctic Circle. *As a newcomer to the dog team delivery service - soon their leader - Buck is having adventure of a lifetime, finally finding his rightful place in the world and becoming the master of his own destiny.*By smoothening London's honest account and description of--pursuant to extreme conditions easily understandable--truly violent interaction between people, animals and nature, primarily by minimizing cruel dog beatings at the hands of their masters and brutal, often fatal dog fights, film makers have altered such survival seeking Darwinian world, in which dog eats dog and a man is (often) a wolf to another man, by promoting rather-friends-then-foes approach towards strangers, and, whenever possible, insisting rather on gentleness than harshness of the great wild outdoors, overhauling the classic story to an easier digestible, ergo family friendlier.Other qualities include good acting, with Harrison Ford as a stand-out, whose husky calm voice offers narration throughout the film, providing vulnerable yet soothing, almost comforting presence in his appearance as John Thornton, seemingly a gold prospector, but in fact, after losing his loved ones, a son to a deadly fever, and a wife to subsequent collapse of his marriage, no more than a grief-stricken redemption seeker. Also, in the first half of the movie, as a far north delivery service running couple, Omar Sy and Cara Gee are joy to watch in their often, despite all difficulties, comic relief providing roles.Film demonstrates commendable seamless integration of CG imagery of beasts and beautiful environments into spectacular cinematography provided by Janusz Kaminski.Joyful music, scored by John Powell, is well-paced to follow the speed of onscreen action and reflect the highs and lows in the moods of characters.All in all, it is nicely crafted film with the fast-paced story, providing enough dramatic excitement and fun, especially for the younger ones.My rating score stops short of perfect, due to a trend described in my second opening note that I cannot easily fall in with, too.Finally, on a lighter note, having film menagerie of animals fully CGI-ed renders monitors from American Humane Association superfluous, as even in their absence we can rest assured that *no (real) animals were harmed during the making of this film.*",The Call of the Wild
170,oscar-montanez,Disappointing use of CGI,2,27 March 2020,"The movie is ok but there are too many CGI errors. The ""extensive"" use of CGI and the fact that it was not even filmed in Alaska is a really big disappointment. The fire in the scene in which ""the bad guy"" is killed is just terrible. The sizes of the dogs are all kinda wrong or changing through the movie. The mastiff looks really small compared with the other dogs.

While I think it's awesome, using a CGI dog to put him and the others through the harsh action scenes, did they have to make him look so cartoonish in the more personal scenes? A dog's reactions should be that of a dog, not a human. About half of the names in the cast are in blink and you'll miss it cameos, and the film only really comes to life when the focus narrows down to Ford and Buck, getting in touch with nature. It's only the last half hour or so, with them, that keeps me from giving this an even lower score.",The Call of the Wild

175,Speedysue2003,This is for all of you that never read the Call of the Wild,10,11 January 2021,"This movie pretty much tells the same story as the book, Call of the Wild. Actors were great. CGI was fine. Too many complainers that just can't enjoy a movie for pure entertainment. Always got to complain. Here is synopsis of book.
""The Call of the Wild is a short adventure novel by Jack London, published in 1903 and set in Yukon, Canada, during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush, when strong sled dogs were in high demand. The central character of the novel is a dog named Buck. The story opens at a ranch in Santa Clara Valley, California, when Buck is stolen from his home and sold into service as a sled dog in Alaska. He becomes progressively primitive and wild in the harsh environment, where he is forced to fight to survive and dominate other dogs. By the end, he sheds the veneer of civilization, and relies on primordial instinct and learned experience to emerge as a leader in the wild.""
Sounds the same as the movie to me. This is a very good movie to watch as a family and listen to what your children say about it. This was mandatory reading when I was in school and the education system in U.S. was good.",The Call of the Wild
176,theojhyman,"Sweet, innocent, old school movie",7,20 February 2020,"I was actually very impressed with the CGI dog, who became more and more real as the film went on, probably because of how emotionally involved you become with his character.
Harrison Ford is great (though in the film for probably 50% of the time).
Anyway, it's all about the story of Buck the dog and it's a sweet, lovely, story with an old school feel. The CGI expressions on Buck's face are just slightly hyper-real, as in a bit overly emotive compared to a dog in reality, but it works, and if you like dogs, then you'll love Buck and his adventures in this movie. He gets treated quite harshly and violently at times, but that makes his story all the more emotional at the end.

The movie isn't all action, it builds the characters well, which is important in a movie that stems from a great book such as Call of the Wild. While it isn't for everyone, what movie could be said to be for everyone?

I thought Harrison Ford + classic adventure story = great entertainment, but the CGI dog ruined it. The movie would have been better if it was either all CGI or all live action. You go into watching a cartoon with the mindset that it isn't going to be totally realistic. If the cartoon is about dogs, you know they will be able to understand exactly what humans are saying and can even talk themselves. You're ok with that because you know it's the nature of a cartoon. But when you go into a live action movie, you expect everything to be realistic and if it isn't, it quickly diminishes the quality of the movie.

There's the hook, add a great story and cast and I'm in. It's pretty early on when you realize the use of the CGI. It seems natural for me to critic it, but it is getting to be a very powerful tool for story telling. You are pulled along in Buck's adventure regardless of it and because of it. I found myself longing to see Mr. Ford, but any human role is limited in the story. It is, after all, Buck's story...

So, I'm only judging the film based on the ""dog"".However, the poor CGI creature wasn't perhaps even its biggest fault. But. If you combine that with the filmmaker's (who've apparently never seen a real canine before) idea of a dog, you get this eerily anthropomorphic disneyesque product designed for six-year-olds'.

Not buying it. I love a good dog movie as much as anyone but this one ain't worth the effort. Try Togo if you want a REALLY good new dog film.

211,EdwardNashtonReeves,A live action attempt at making an animated classic,6,8 October 2020,"The film is a loose adaptation of Jack London's classic novel from 1903. While the story beats aren't necessarily that different, the execution certainly is. The film simply cannot decide whether it wants to be a fairy tale or realistic and hovers in between. However, there is one genre in which this balance usually works well and that is an animated film.Looking at the way the dogs have been animated, the way the human actors are directed and the way it's been paced, scored and designed, it feels like it was originally meant for animation. The director actually doing some animated films prior to this should come as a no surprise.The story itself is heartfelt, but choppy. We follow city dog Buck as he's been abducted and sold in Alaska and then Canada. He matures and finds his way in the wild. Meanwhile, he meets several human and animal characters to interact with. The issue becomes the fact that as we follow his journey, most of these relationships end-up unresolved and tossed aside for a new story to come.The character we get most familiar with is definitely John Thornton, masterfully played by Harrison Ford. He is the only human character who is well fleshed out, given a deep and tragic backstory and time to establish his closeness to Buck. Their scenes are by far the most emotional ones.Postman Perrault (Omar Sy) and his partner Francoise (Cara Gee) are also likable, but as soon as we start knowing them better, they disappear from the film. I won't even bother to say anything about Bradley Whitford's essentially non-presence in the film.The villain Hal, played by Dan Stevens, feels one-dimensional and over-the-top, even if Stevens feels charismatic in the role. He's simply not given much to work with. I guess it's mainly for omitting the key scene of properly understanding his character.In the book (and Wikipedia page giving the synopsis), his two companions are named as Mercedes (Really good, off-type Karen Gillan) and Charles (Colin Woodell) and said to be his brother and sister-in-law. The film establishes no such relations. Also, it subtly implied that they might have died in the moment when dogs ran off, but again, it was never addressed. If it was, he might have been given a proper reason for wanting to exact revenge on Thornton and Buck. This way, with nobody seemingly dying, he just feels shallow and evil.Gillan, Woodell and the sleigh dogs being completely forgotten creates another emotional issue. Despite Perrault giving Buck a mission to take care for his pack, he never bothers to search for them afterwards. Them being dead would've solved that issue, but with them just stranded at the woods, it feels like an unresolved plot thread.Instead, the dogs are put aside and his new relationships start building-up with wolves. While charming and cute, his romance with the female grey wolf does feel glanced over. What works here, though, is him finally seeing who he is inside. The film shows a lot of moments of him not being adapted to living in human civilizations, so him finding himself in the woods only makes sense.I really loved how the film gave Thornton a tragic backstory echoing his need to mentor someone into growing-up and finding themselves. Even though Buck is a dog, you get that sense of a true friendship with father / son undertones. By setting Buck truly free, he managed to fulfill some of his fatherly duties that haunted him.The scenery is immensely beautiful. Camera work really well establishes lovely mountains, polar light and gorgeous woods. The CGI is actually really good for the most part (in some fast movement scenes it can be too noticeable), even if it feels different from the realistic sets around it.So, even though there is a lot to unpack, this film still managed to do it's main job. And why is that? Because I believe that it was primarily directed to children. It has all the wonders, thrills and emotions most of the animated classic have. Children will probably eat this up. They likely won't care if the movie follows the book. The likely won't care which part of the CGI is the most realistic or which character feels over-the-top. They'll be entertained, touched and likely fulfilled. In the end, isn't that what any movie actually aims for?",The Call of the Wild

213,tlgodderz,"A feel good, wonderful movie for (almost) all ages!",10,22 February 2020,"What a spectacular movie! I absolutely loved it!

I doubt that all children would be able to tell. He looked absolutely real, and some of his--and the other dogs/wolves--expressions will melt your heart. Yes, it was a little sweet at times, yes it was a feel good story designed to pull at your heartstrings, but I will take that any day over the violence, gore, and stupidity that a lot of movies are nowadays. Harrison Ford played the human protagonist perfectly, and Omar Sy did great as well, as sympathetic, kind characters.

Harrison Ford does a very simple yet good performance, the narrative is simple and easy to figure out for adults but still very relate-able and, the whole journey of the protagonists is really good a true adventure of self-discovery... What really told me that the movie nailed it, was when in the end I asked my 9 year old, what was it all about... and she goes it's about being you, not letting others tell you what you can or cannot do... and my 12 years old, goes like it's about finding your place in the world...take the kids, have them be quite and listen...they might just get some life lessons out of it.",The Call of the Wild

The CGI animals were good but didn't take me out of myself. It's schmalzy and cheesy but good fun and I shed a few tears. 3.5 stars

Mise-En-Scene, Cinematography and Editing are all incredible. Admittedly the dogs can look out of place at times due to them being completely animated but these moments are fleeting and quickly covered for by some stunning visuals.Most importantly John Powell's score blows some scenes out of the water entirely. You can counting on perfect crescendos, glorious melodies and the use of an orchestra to all its potential!The film suffered a lack of audience, a big shame for a film that's lighthearted and 99 minutes of FUN.

Ford, now 77 years old, wasn't up to the heavy, physical demands of filming in Arctic conditions. Scooby Doo has to pull the load, in more ways than one, with Ford's digitally inserted beard obscuring his features. But Scooby pulls it off! Who knew he had these dramatic chops?

This movie is based on a story. Harrison Ford, who played John Thornton, saved Buck from the prospectors and strangers who were abusing him. My favorite parts about the movie is when Buck got to see the black wolf spirit, hanging out with Ford, and meeting with the timber wolves. It shows the dogs that they don't have to be around humans if they keep abusing them. It also shows the viewers about life lessons of dogs feeling happy to be with their own kind. The ending of this movie is definitely a happy one. So, I recommend this movie to all dog lovers around America, to understand how dogs can get used to wildlife and how to survive.

At first I was a bit taken aback by the CGI, but I quickly learned to love Buck, and I feel like the team did a great job with the animals in this movie. I thought they looked good and were pretty naturally animated. The story seems very mild, and I guess it has to be for a family friendly movie.

A big win for this movie is the setting. I love all things Alaska so I couldn't get enough of the beautiful panoramic shots. I suppose it's ""neat"" having Harrison Ford in the film, though it seems unnecessary because his acting skills are not being used in the film, so his personality seems off. Other than that it is just fun seeing him in a movie. I also like how the movie keeps moving. Buck is immersed more and more into the wilderness at a pace that seems about right, from a spoiled house dog, to a sled dog, to a free pack member. As final acts go it wasn't bad, but wasn't great. It was predictable that the antagonist would show up again, but they did a good job of making his arrival untimely. I liked the music in the film, again, the visuals, the CGI was okay, not incredibly realistic but enough so that it wasn't distracting. I have not read the book so I cannot vouch for accuracy, but I did enjoy the film even though I was dragged to the cinema by my family members interested I watching it. It is a good family movie with minimal cursing if any if I remember correctly.

It is what I would deem The Call of the Wild-lite, meaning it does provide the gist of the original story without all of the violence and death.In the original novel, violence and death are a part of daily existence in Buck's tumultuous experience, from watching a dog get ripped into literal shreds to committing acts of wild violence himself-at one point, he takes down a bull moose on his own. The latter is proof of his wolfish qualities rising to the surface. None of this is in the film.Yet it is understandable to leave that level of violence out of what was intended to be a PG film from its inception, so I can forgive that much. What I cannot forgive is cutting scenes that were significant but had no gore or death-the sled pull competition or Buck saving Thornton from river rapids as two examples. Strange that Sanders created new storylines to fill the holes of what would have been exciting sequences. Oh well.It's a fun watch, and definitely heartwarming. At least the ending is pretty faithful, and thank goodness it is the story of Buck and not Thornton for once (mostly).",The Call of the Wild

All I can say, I forgot how important researching is before watching a film. The movie was a disappointment, and here are some important keys that makes it a horrible experience:The movie heavily uses CGI. There's only one reason to complain about CGI, and that's when it's obviously horrible CGI. The movie employs CGI not only for everyday characters, but also for everyday environment.The acting is bad. It only takes one sour apple to ruin a barrel. This is the case of a side character voicing too loud. If the movie was based on that actor, it would be enjoyable, but instead, it went the comical route that sticks out like a sore thumb.The story is full of cliches. This is probably where the good reviews and the bad reviews clashes. If you're new, young, inexperienced, this movie is smooth for you. If you're the opposite, every action and moral that happens is a cliche that isn't well performed. The movie is very fast paced that you're constantly bombarded with poor executions one after another.Fast paced is also very injuring to the movie because it skips character developments. With no character developments, everything you hear from actors sounds like poor improv acting... it's almost like it's based on a book or something... yup, it is. With that, unless you're familiar with the novel, this isn't a movie you'll want to brag about.Overall to say, this is a family kids movie... with obvious CGI.",The Call of the Wild

264,The_Devin_G,Call of the Wild - except its not.,5,24 October 2021,"This movie is incredibly frustrating, it could be REALLY good, the CGi animals gives the producers the ability to make them do whatever they want and really nail the adaptation. Except they dont do it. Instead they inject human action and emotions into the film at such a level that it feels more like a Disney fairytale instead of the brutal tale of survival and grown in the North that Call of the Wild is known to be.Basically, they took an amazing story about harsh reality, with real character growth and hardship. Then they removed almost all of the harshness of it. So Buck, the dog, the main character, is just making weird growth spurts all of the way through for no real reason.---------- Warning : Potential Spoilers Below ----------I guess you could sort of consider the rest of this to contain spoilers if you live under a rock and have somehow never read one of the best-selling books of all-time.I realize that maybe the idea for this film was to make Call of the Wild a little more children friendly. But this is seriously bad, the action sequences are awful because of how hard they tried to make it friendly. Most of the ""fights"" in here are just the dogs hitting each other with their shoulders or doing weird WWE moves. If the CGI dogs had acted even slightly like real dogs or if Buck showed any kind of real aggression or anger it would feel a lot better. But the stupid cartoony humor and actions of the dogs is incredibly reality breaking and dissapointing.The fact that Buck refuses to really bite Spitz, or that he refuses to bite the cruel characters in the movie feels wrong. Not to mention that it's terribly unfaithful to the source material ( the book ) and it's just not satisfying to watch at all.Overall - I guess you could watch this with young kids and they would love it. Yay? But Call of the Wild isn't meant to really be a childrens story, even though there's nothing wrong with letting your children enjoy it. I remember reading the book originally late in gradeschool, and I thoguht it was fantastic, in fact I have read it multiple times throughout my life, and I enjoyed it.This movie just feels like the producers were trying to satisfy everyone, and the result is a lukewarm, unexciting product.",The Call of the Wild

Another thing, didn't feel any connection with Buck's masters, specially with John Thornton. Was going too flat, too predictable, too nice, to the point that it felt fake and unreal. CGI was fine, but it still put off, made me believe less.

276,healingtoolbox,"For CGI nerds 8/10 Erik Nash, James Mangold, pre-viz done right, MPC",8,13 December 2020,"This project was probably inspired by the success of John Favreau's First Jungle Book. Call of teh Wild looks like the Peter Rabbit live action + CGI formula but no evidence of overlap. At $135 million budget it was intended to repeat the success of Jungle Book.Like the recent Peter Rabbit films, COTW is designed to make Buck the dog lovable enuf for sequels. This means playing down the deliberate ""survival of the fittest"" cruelty in the original source novella. However stripped of ""R"" brutality, the story faces the possibility of becoming bland mush. The Golden Compass (2002) is famous for this in my mind: take out all the quirky plot points--tired character and visual tropes are sucked into the vacuum.Fortunately James Mangold (Logan, Indy 5) is here shaping the narrative to weave a character arc for Thorton (Harrison Ford). As a commercial project, this was the best narrative solution I can think of too.What results is a whiz-bang AAA CGI main character with hundreds of live + CGI shots done to perfection by MPC. The pre-viz by Halon Entertainment, a AAA previs company, is so good, it's quite noticeable in the final shots.The problem with very detailed previs and many plot points communicated by images with no dialogue, is the visual tropes in the final product can come out ""too on the nose."" Audiences feel like they are watching an anime and dissociate from how and what the characters feel. This danger is admirably navigated.So if you like VFX, see it for how animated lead charcter animation is developing.",The Call of the Wild

Not only are the dogs fake (CGI generated), but the majority of the film is shot on sets and the ""nature"" scenes and blowing snow are computer animations. Maybe the producers should've spent less money on a detached walk-through role by Harrison Ford and actually shot the film in the Wild (as the title suggests). I would've enjoyed it better if it was a cartoon movie altogether. The author of this story, Jack London, told a story of man and dog vs. nature, and the cold realities of the frozen north. The movie failed to make us viewers understand the gist of London's message. The dogs were portrayed as human-like in their thinking and actions; much like a Disney-Lion-King aberration.Along the way, many parts of of the great London novel were altered or removed, most significantly, the sled-pulling gambling scene that was so important to the book. Also, the film's hero, John Thornton (portrayed lackadaisically by Ford), meets his fate by a manner completely different than what happened in the book.Do not see this movie unless you are under the age of 12 (or if you want to take the kiddies to a film).

297,writetonight-1,"Cute Screen Version, But Has Flaws",6,11 March 2020,"I read ""Call of the Wild"" in elementary school and saw this for the nostalgia. It was a very cute film and I enjoyed the comedic tone of the film. I may have even liked this film better than the book. It's perfect for a rainy day with the kids. Harrison Ford seemed very at home as John Thornton.I was disappointed with a fault in the storytelling. Buck has a rivalry with the lead sled dog, a Siberian Husky, an alpha dog that chases rabbits to kill them, while Buck just chases rabbits for fun, then let's them go. There is a climactic fight between Buck and the lead dog, as the vie for alpha dog status. Buck wins the fight, but it is not shown that he kills the Husky, he just gets the better of him in the fight. In the next scene, the Husky dog is mysteriously gone, although we never saw him die, run from Buck in fear, slink away in shame or get chased away. He is gone with no explanation, and the two humans who own the sled dog team- a team they depend on for their livelihood- never once ask where the missing dog is, or attempt to search for him. I feel that whole in the story was unforgivable; it's the kind of thing that keeps a family film from becoming a ""classic.""And WHEN will these people in Hollywood stop thinking that they are geniuses for throwing a bunch of black actors into period films, in roles that are extremely unlikely for blacks? Omar Sy is a fine actor, and he had his charms as Perrault, but he looked hopelessly out of place in 1890's Alaska, as did all of the black extras.
I don't want to hear any excuses about ""representation."" Some of us movie-goers appreciate authenticity in period films, even whimsical ones with dogs who show human emotion. I looked up the State of Alaska's population statistics from 1890, and guess what? There were so few black people there that there was no ""Black"" category; they would have been counted as ""other,"" if they were there at all, and we don't know if they were. Native Americans (listed as ""Indians"") were the overwhelming majority in Alaska; whites were the largest minority group, followed by ""Mongolians"" (Asians), and ""Mixed."" If any group was ""underrepresented"" in this film, it was Native Americans. The Native American woman who ran the sled dog team was a Kim Kadashian version of an Alaskan native. She spoke like a modern Californian, not someone whose first language was an indigenous one. There was certainly a missed opportunity here for giving us a glimpse of native Alaskan culture. Instead, all we got was over-representation of black people.
Omar Sy would have been better cast if the film had taken place in 1890's New Orleans. There's nothing wrong with having a white actor play a French Canadian, especially in a story that takes place during the Gold Rush. I wish the casting directors and producers would grow some balls and start casting properly. The folks who did extra casting for this film failed to do their homework as well.",The Call of the Wild

The fight with Spitz lacks the realism of the original and Francois never had a woman as a partner for his Mail responsibilities to Dawson. Why call it 'The call of the wild' at all?

This isn't the Call of the Wild you get from reading the book. It's more expansive without the weighted sled pulls or the dog fighting, and I'm totally cool with that.

It'd be like being the makeup artist for the Ms. Cyclops beauty pageant; you just can't hide what it really is and anything you do seems artificial. The conflicts are so forced you'd think OJ Simpson wrote them. They're worse at inspiration than a divorce that didn't go your way. The characters are good, bad, and dog. The dialogue was written after they looked up how to write dialogue on Google. Now, it was high budget, well filmed, and the story was coherent and made sense.

360,Sax6M,"Drawn by Curiosity, Stayed fir the Story - and the Production",8,28 April 2021,"When I was in my early teens the first movie adaptation was released. I never saw it. When I saw the trailers and teases for this production, I was drawn by both curiosity about the story and Harrison Ford. I got my reward very early into the movie.The early CGI effects made me wonder if I was walking into a kid movie trap. However, the CGI effects soon became an indispensable element in the film. It was not overdone. It was not juvenizing. It was joy-enhancing.I am not a professional movie critic. I am not a professional critic of anything. I am a musician, a composer and performer, who loves his craft. I can be very analytical with music. With film, i can only tell what and sometimes why I liked or did not like a movie.I liked the acting and pace of the story. I liked the effect of the CGI, humanizing the animals' expression of their response to the events in the movie. It was not overdone. There was no more than a very brief ""virtue signaling"" event. Maybe it was in the book which I never read, but now will. However, the incident was so brief that most would either miss it or quickly dismiss it. Perhaps some of the casting and character portrayal decisions were ""woke"" decisions, but they were logically plausible enough to be negated. Again, not having read the book, this could have been more faithful to the original story than I know. At the point that I started loving the movie, maybe less than a half hour in,was the FIRST time I was almost in tears. I fell in love with this gargantuan (real-life)St. Bernard/Collie mix. And Harrison Ford was the right actor for his role. It was the first time that I realized why I have liked him since I became cognitively aware of him in 1977, in Star Wars. There was a moment when he flashed that Hans Solo/Indiana Jones half smile that is so disarming and assuring. It made me feel like I was part of the production crew and he was re-assuring me. I know it is a stretch, but I finally saw what this man (yours truly) has always liked about the actor. Is he like this in real life and on sets?I will go no further than to say that I am always looking for media to share with my family, which includes grandchildren and a great-grandchild.

The story rewrite was inexcusably bad and most of the characters seem to have been chosen to satisfy the pc critics rather than to enhance the plot. That said, Omar Sy was likeable and well played in spite of the pc casting. Dan Stevens' archest of villains was simply laughable.

Thankfully the attempts at being funny were dropped when we left California but what is a fascinating journey into the wild in the novel is really shallow in this movie.

Not only are the dogs fake (CGI generated), but the majority of the film is shot on sets and the ""nature"" scenes and blowing snow are computer animations. Maybe the producers should've spent less money on a detached walk-through role by Harrison Ford and actually shot the film in the Wild (as the title suggests). I would've enjoyed it better if it was a cartoon movie altogether. The author of this story, Jack London, told a story of man and dog vs. nature, and the cold realities of the frozen north. The movie failed to make us viewers understand the gist of London's message. The dogs were portrayed as human-like in their thinking and actions; much like a Disney-Lion-King aberration.Along the way, many parts of of the great London novel were altered or removed, most significantly, the sled-pulling gambling scene that was so important to the book. Also, the film's hero, John Thornton (portrayed lackadaisically by Ford), meets his fate by a manner completely different than what happened in the book.Do not see this movie unless you are under the age of 12 (or if you want to take the kiddies to a film).

In the first 5 minutes, the dog's animation looks as if it contains no bones. However, quickly; the dog becomes more realistic. Maybe it's a stylistic choice as the dog's life becomes less perfect and 'cartoony' - or maybe it was a coincidence.I feel that the dog sled scenes could have been fleshed out more. They were interesting.Harrison Ford is great in many parts in this movie, certain points I think the acting of the actors does decrease.However if you don't like films where you don't know the outcome of every character in great detail, then the ending won't be for you, but I loved this film.

First things first, this movie isn't taking place in 2000something but in 190 something, which blowed my mind. The settings, the scenery the people's old habits. All felt so real. And the star of our movie is a large wonderful doggo named Buck! Again, I was pleasently surprised!
Some argue that the CGI dog was awful, but I actually loved it! I know his expressions wasn't real but they matched movie's atmosphere which is narrated astonishingly by Harrison Ford.
So, I don't want to give too much of the movie that's why I conclude telling that it's an unforgettable journey, full of heart-warming doggies, not so heart-warming people, nature and an self-discovery adventure that will stick with you long after the movie is over.
If you are looking for a movie to watch with your grown up family, or a good 2020 movie in general then look no further.
I haven't read the novel and I know that some reviewers said that it wasn't a good adaptation, but if it made me actually want to read the novel now that I have never heard of, then this movie can't be so bad as they describe it to be. Give it a try. In my honest opinion you won't regret it.*SPOILERS SCENES THAT BROKE MY HEART INTO PIECES*
1. When they take Buck from his beloved home
2. When they mal-treat him and hit him on the boat
3. When the haski dog leaves! Why did he had to leave!? He could stay with them being the B-male. Sure it would wound his pride but so many other worst things could happen to him in the woods. I sure didn't like him, but didn't wish for him to leaver either!
4. When the good mail-man is fired and he is telling Buck ""No. You did nothing wrong"" while petting him and looking him in the eyes before unintentionally leaving him...
5. When that Devil of a man, hit the dogs, is ready to kill Buck, only having the gold in mind - agh! One of worst villains ever-!!
6. When we learn that his pack left and Buck couldn't do anything about it, but looking at the sky full of stars and missing them...
7. When that same Devil kills Harrison! Oh come on! He would return to his wife trying to do things right and maybe build his house and forget together their son's lost! His last words to her in the letter were devastating. Oh come on! Why? Why? He had just not only find gold but also himself! Buck and Harrison were lost and together they found where the belong to this world! Especially Buck helped Harrison to wonder what he is doing being away from everybody and his wife, and think and learn and decide and discover! And now he is taking from us? From our story? From the happy ending he deserved?!? That especially broke my heart more than anything else!!!
At least Buck was happy. After all that he suffered. At last. He is home. He is his own master.

395,ante-alajbeg,Save yourself 100 minutes of life by doing ANYTHING ELSE,1,21 February 2020,"If you wonder why youngsters (or people in general) are getting more stupid by every generation, this movie is a prefect answer.
I mean, it's understandable it's made for kids, but even as such, it should be at least a superficially realistic. I am shocked and disappointed that actor like Harrison Ford belittled himself to this.Obviously, lots of money was spent and lot of hard work was invested on all the animations, but movie defies every single logic there is. And I'm not talking about movies story line, I'm referring to the actual presentation or adaptation of this movie... It's sad that today's movie directors all (or almost all) think that lots of CGI will make a great movie without any thought on the story and emotion. This movie in fact has very interesting story and if recorded (or animated) with just a mild dosage of reality would have made a great family movie. But when you have dogs with human expressions on their faces it's hard to swallow anything else - and that's not even close to worst parts of this movie.Unfortunately, as stated in my title, go save yourself from disappointment and rather stare at empty wall for 100 minutes, it would be a time better spent.",The Call of the Wild

And yes again its not like the book, but deep down not bothered as we we entertained with the story that was served up.

400,jasperborst,Amazing movie,10,23 April 2020,"I love this movie because it's about a dog who has to go through a lot of bad situation to find his own home. Beginning with the family who doesn't understand him. Being kidnapped. Then live goes up you have to run for a man who treats you good. He goes out of business so you get bought by some prick who doesn't know how to handle you. But then your live goes up again you get saved by Harrison ford who treats you well. You go on an adventure with him but he gets shot by the prick I mentioned earlier. But it ends good all good. He found his own home his own pack. I love these kind of movies. The main character has to go through good and bad to find his or her home. It makes you think doesn't it

405,outatime-82216,Disney destroys everything it touches.,1,11 August 2020,"More proof that Disney destroys everything it touches! This movie is nothing like the book. They made it as PC as possible which is par for the course for Disney these days. Harrison Ford was barely in it for the first half. Karen Gillian was one of the top billed stars and was only in it for a few minutes and had about 2 lines. The story was extremely predictable and the scene where Harrison threw most of his gold back into the river was silly and totally unbelievable. I knew he was going to do it. (At this point in the movie I figured all of the characters were going to make the stupidest decisions and most of the time that's what happened). Avoid this movie at all costs. It is pure garbage. Even if I was a kid I would have disliked it. Shame on you Disney, the magic is gone!",The Call of the Wild

I was actually very impressed with the CGI dog, who became more and more real as the film went on, probably because of how emotionally involved you become with his character. Harrison Ford is great (though in the film for probably 50% of the time). Anyway, it's all about the story of Buck the dog and it's a sweet, lovely, story with an old school feel.",The Call of the Wild
411,nefonbr,"Good Movie, strictly for little kids",5,4 April 2020,"Since I read the book I had completely built it up in my head and this movie kinda killed it for me.First of all why use CGI it is dogs not aliens, in the times where the dog is being beaten it is acceptable but when the dog is simply being a dog why?
Plus the CGI was moderate at best. I honestly think that the movie would be awesome if it was a loyal remake to the original. Many scenes were removed that were critical for the book so many stuff were removed and replaced that if the movie wasn't named as such and the dog wasn't called Buck I would think this was another movie.Make a normal PG-12 movie that is loyal to the book after all that is why most people came in in the first place.Another important decision is to use a black man for Perau and an asian girl for Fransoize(who btw is a boy in the original) no I understand equality and all but there was no way a girl and a black man would have such a position at the time. Lets be realistic.On a positive note for your kids it is great I am sure they will love it and even learn stuff.",The Call of the Wild
412,MagmaChou,A sincere and captivating story,8,2 April 2020,"The movie is based on the eponymous novel by Jack London, which may set some expectations, however, the general ambience is very different from what one may have imagined. With lots of challenges that encounters the main hero and very different types of characters he meets, the story is really reminiscent of a classical tale, where every step of the journey is a lesson of some kind, leading to a final destination of the hero.Production is great; the picture is fabulous, which, along with a thoughtful sound design, allows to emerge in the story. The whole CGI work is incredible, making modeled characters look very well alive. One may point at some plot holes but they wouldn't seem much of an issue.Finally, in my opinion, the ending of the movie is satisfying and offers a great message to reflect upon.",The Call of the Wild

I was 7 when I read the original story and it's been my favorite since, so I don't think we need to ruin the novel so completely to protect the kids.",The Call of the Wild

Buck, a spoiled dog is taken from his owners and sent to Yukon. He suffers initially before being taken as a dog in mail delivery sled. There are some spectacular scenes during Buck's time as a maildog that you do not want to miss! The rest of the movie is about how Buck finds love again and finally lives the life he is meant to be.Harrison Ford's acting is wonderful. But truly the scene stealers are the spectacular scenery and Buck himself. Buck's expressions and body language are exactly what you would see in a real dog. The story is told beautifully. There is a slight deviation from the book, for certain scenes, that would not be politically correct in today's world. But as someone who loved the book as a child, this movie is everything I imagined Buck's world to be as I was reading his story.Do not miss this movie for anything!

My biggest problem was with the animals. The wolves were hunting wild pigs and pheasant! Apparently, the filmmakers didn't think there are enough native animal species in the Yukon, they had to import some from the lower US. Either that, or they didn't think Joe Average would recognize beaver and ptarmigan. Other than that, I found it an enjoyable, if very sanitized, adaptation of the book.",The Call of the Wild

They flew through events with no emotional build up and had very little character development. I had no emotional connection to the first half whatsoever. They didn't even build Bucks character up until the last 1/3 of the movie. The movie only got decently enjoyable near the last half when Harrison and Buck go into the wild. This is where they build characters and more story and emotion to it. It could have been WAY better. Also the biggest drawback in this movie was the animation of Buck - he looked completely fake. They might as well have just done the entire movie animated like wtf???? They did Jack London no justice with this film.",The Call of the Wild

Well, The Call of the Wild doesn't seem to know what it's about. It's certainly not the story of a dog, and it's also hard to relate to it as a story about a person.The use of famous actors from sci-fi movies/series was also detracting. Drummer from The Expanse, and Han Solo from Star Wars. The diversity squad was also detracting.If I was caught in a bear trap I wouldn't feel compelled to chew my foot off to escape watching this movie, but it wasn't great.",The Call of the Wild

I guess it would be too hard to train a pack of sled dogs to do what they do all their lives. But I guess if you're a kid watching this I guess it would be good.

I had read parts of the book previously but I had never seen any other adaptation of the film. My first thoughts from the trailer were ""I'll see it because I love Harrison Ford, but the dog looks very weird"". To my surprise, it was a fantastic film. Admittedly, at times Buck did look a little strange. But the dog being CGI was probably the better option as some of the action scenes involving Buck running or fighting would be hard to shoot. However, I'd say that was the only massive flaw of the film. The plot can be dry at some points, but I don't have a way of describing why. Buck's adventure was really well told and the emotional scenes hit very hard. I have a feeling that this film includes a very underrated performance by Harrison Ford. He portrays his character of a broken man that finally gets a friend in the form of Buck, ventures off the map only to be shot by an angry and jealous high-class man so beautifully. It's such a sad but glorious ending, getting to go on his son's adventure of dreams with his new best friend, only to die with him by his side. Incredibly poetic. I suppose the only flaws would be the plot is a little slow at some points and Buck can look a little strange at some points as well. Regardless, an incredible film!",The Call of the Wild

This is precisely a family film and it was presented as such, so do not wait for a detailed quote of the book.
I will not say that exactly Harrison Ford pulled this movie because I review the film as a whole picture, and not its individual components, this is just stupid. But yes, Harryson Ford played his part perfectly, introducing a share of seriousness and tragedy into tale motives.For this that he was invited to this role and it was a 100% right decision.Maybe a little less emotion of the dog benefited the perception of the film as a whole. In general, I received great pleasure from the picture and presentation of the story. Great movie to just relax and have fun alone or with your family. Focusing on the family format, and not on a strict quote from the book, only benefited the film. This is a great occasion to introduce the audience to the books of Jack London and at the same time have a good time with your family.",The Call of the Wild

Although this movie does'nt follow the exact storyline of the classic Jack London book, it still is entertaining and fun to watch.

464,tswain-25230,Beautifully made,8,29 February 2020,"A very well made adaptation of Jack London's book.
Yes the film is lighter and made for a more family friendly view, but it also sheds light on harsh realities of life in just the right amount for children viewing.
The cgi version of buck in my opinion was done well and manages to move you, and tugs on heart strings for all watching.
In my personal opinion it would have been better to see a real dog, but although buck was cgi your still drawn to his character and the story which is told at a very good pace and you will never lose interest as to what is going to happen next.
Harrison Ford say no more gives a tip top performance as always and fits his role perfectly. As do all actors involved in this movie. The beautiful scenery and cinematography also play a huge part of the movie for me and looks beautiful on the big screen. If this film doesn't move you in anyway then you sir/madam must have a heart of stone. Enjoy",The Call of the Wild
465,dah-60390,A disaster of an adaptation,1,3 March 2020,Very little of this movie follows the book besides a few names and places.

467,goldendragons-80782,Way too family friendly and CGI was used too much,4,5 April 2020,"Ok, where do I start with this movie? The CGI was good but really unnecessary, you're telling me a movie with a budget of over 100 million dollars couldn't afford to get actual trained dogs on set. Buck is introduced as being spoiled like in the book, but in the movie, he is so annoying. I know he is a dog and all that but it really made me angry when we see him at first. Then we get introduced to the law of club, Buck gets hit LITERALLY ONCE then decides that the club is too overpowered. If there was something I did like it was Perrault, I enjoyed his kindness. But this movie does what a lot of book-inspired movies do, switch out a male character for a woman, don't get me wrong I'm not misogynistic, but it just makes no sense and confused me the first time I saw her. Before I get into anything else I wanted to say that the movie was WAY too short, it could have easily been a 2-hour film. Anyways back to the movie, it was way too family-friendly, desperately trying to get the little kids to come and see the ""pretty little doggies"", even though the age group they are trying to reach probably can't even read yet. Buck and Spitz have their little ""fight"" if you can call it that, buck wins and Spitz....... just leaves, oh yeah did I mention curly doesn't even die? Neither does Dave or Dolly. Perrault and Francois' (not gonna use the special character in his name sorry) trip gets randomly canceled so they have to sell the dogs. This is where the 3 idiots come in, I hate them and I'm supposed to, the movie did fantastic with these 3. Buck and John meet before even Buck meets Perrault, which I didn't like too much. John is unnecessarily shown to be a grieving alcoholic after his son's death. Hans comes back as a conflict yet again for no reason, I guess the film didn't want to show that John was killed by Indians? Anyways, overall if you haven't read the book this would be a fun watch and if you have read it, then this is not too great.",The Call of the Wild

This was not a good adaptation of 'call of the wild'. I understand why it is the way it is, considering that it is supposed to be a family friendly movie.

I appreciate that live dogs were not placed in dangerous situations, and where would there be trained-for-acting dogs who can also pull a laden sled?

472,thesingerdandelion,This is not Call of the Wild. Not even remotely close adaptations.,1,28 August 2020,"If you want to watch an actual adaptation of the intensely dramatic book, this is not it. Jack London fans will be mortified, over protective parents will be satisfied it's just a happy dog movie.Number one issue is. Why is Harrison Ford narrating? The book is from Buck's perspective not a man's. Disney could've had the dog narrating, not sure why the dog can understand really complex human emotions and the side effects of drinking, but not his own narration.Second major issue is. The book is PG-13 to R not PG, they could have at least made it a teen movie and done a better job portraying the violence and brutality that was commonplace in the novel. The team of dogs die, they don't run away from Hal(Dan Stevens) the incompetent rich guy in the film. They all die by falling in the river. That's one simple story change that changes the whole ending.In the book Harrison Ford's character is also killed by Native Americans while Buck is out with the wolves. Buck then goes on a vengeful killing spree and kills the Natives and their dogs.Overall, this movie has ruined the entire story line and is not worth watching. Just pick up the book and you'll be way better off.This should have been called. Buck a Children's Tale and not ""Call of the Wild""",The Call of the Wild
473,rabiamim,Door to an awakening humanity,8,27 September 2020,"I believe 'A thing is valued where it belongs'....so the ending was satisfactory for me. Then, again, in the procedure of Buck's coming back to his pavilion, he met several people which are the mirror of this universe, of us like some are alone, some need a pet for their own existence, some make them usable for human services, some selfishly operate them and some actually understand them. As well I was astonished to see the expression, emotions, skills of Buck. And last but not the least, the name, call of the wild is meant to understand us wildness also meant to be soft and raw emotions and the absence of it in humanity.",The Call of the Wild

I can see why Hollywood has to make up their own version of the book. The book make a better story than this movie. Indian killed our human main figure not some guy who was mad at Buck's master. Buck in the book kills the lead dog in the sled team. In the book Buck kills the Indians that killed his master. Important in that the Indians from the same tribe called Buck the Ghost Dog.

It provides for good entertainment that kids, especially, will love. I mean who doesn't love a huge smart and caring dog. The dogs are so realistic that i couldn't find any CGI flaw. Their expressions were far better than the (acclaimed) Lion King last rendition. I have 2 dogs, a small and a big one. I can tell you that the dogs expressions and reactions are spot on without being out of touch like the Lion King. For once they don't talk.

490,wildphantom-685-188648,Throwback family entertainment and a landmark film....,8,15 May 2020,"Chris Sanders has made some tremendous family movies at Disney and Dreamworks. Clearly brought up on the great Disney movies of his childhood and preceding it, he has made a career of pairing together unlikely friendships, with unique tools to realise it.I have never read the book, and from what I've heard it's clear he has taken the spirit and produced an adaptation something like what Walt Disney would have done. Here is where the film really resonated with me - what would Walt have done?Sanders has, perhaps for the very first time, realised what you have to do to make a live action film with a CG animal as your protagonist truly work. We all sat there wondering why Disney's astonishing Lion King remake felt quite so soulless last summer. The reason - there's zero point in making your animals so realistic, to the degree that you can't relate to them. Sanders understood this when taking on Call of the Wild. Buck is a fully realised CG Disney animated animal. Everything bar talking. We relate, empathise, laugh and are moved with what he does because of the character that they've brought to life. It might look real, but then so did Lady, Tramp, Nana, Pongo, Perdita etc in the hand drawn classics within the environments they were in. Imagine if we'd watched those characters without, well, the character. This was the mistake much of The Lion King remake made, and what Sanders knew and steered well away from.Buck is fully believable in inhabiting the adventure he takes with a spirited Harrison Ford performance. The film feels like a throwback to the sort of Disney films the studio used to make in both live action, and animation - and at least to this viewer, felt like a revelation, 'penny has dropped' kind of moment for how to animate animals if you want to put them front and centre of a live action movie. Don't let them talk, as that's pulling us out of buying their presence. Yet absolutely make them characters.Anthropomorphism people. you have to make them a little bit like us for us to care. Walt knew it. Sanders has learnt all the lessons from the master.For the first time in a long while, this felt to me like a film Walt would have made if he was around to oversee the technology advances in animation. This is a proper Disney family adventure movie. Technically groundbreaking, but full of heart and spirit. I suspect it will be considered a classic in years to come.How ironic it took a Fox film to do what Disney's live action remake movies have failed to do at this point. Perhaps the studio was destined to become part of their portfolio. Just like Pixar was. Pictures made my filmmakers that want to make the films Disney used to make.Don't miss this.",The Call of the Wild

The movie tries to take a dark novel about a dog that suffers and overcomes tragedy upon tragedy and make it into a Beethoven movie. There was one scene that pretty much killed the movie for me. When Buck is rescued by John Thornton the rest of the team continues on to an unstable frozen river. In the book the entire party, both dogs and humans fall through the ice and drown. I was cringing in the theatre as this moment approached, but it never happens. The man who was leading this group then returns as the primary antagonist of the film. The reason that this was done leads to the other big issue in the movie. This character wasn't killed so he could be the one to kill John.
In the book it was Indians, which wouldn't fit the agenda today. This also meant that Buck didn't get to hunt down and terrorize the tribe that killed John as in the book, which is how he answered the call of the wild.

The film, on the other hand, is a kiddie show full of sentimental drivel that misses the mark. The landscape is beautiful, the cinematography is great. The CGI dogs are laughable. As far as the actual story line goes, I must admit I was happy to see the story unfold in the same chronology as the novel (unlike the Clark Gable ""Love Story"") but there were some pivotal scenes from the novel that were simply left out (for example: the scene where John wagers that Buck can pull a 1000 lb sled 100 yards.) The number one issue that I had with the film was the lack of ""Love"" between Buck and John Thornton. I felt that relationship between Perrault and Buck was much stronger in this adaptation and that simply is not in keeping with the story line that this film is ""Based on"". Great family show, but if you are looking for a film that depicts the realism and naturalism of Jack London's great novel, keep looking...",The Call of the Wild
522,londreseats,A feel good film for difficult times,10,3 May 2020,"Even though the dog was CGI, you'd have to be heartless to not have your heartstrings tugged. Just calls for a little imagination. Also, this was the first time in weeks that my family was thoroughly able to forget about current pandemic issues for an entire film. We laughed, and we cried, but overall we LOVED it so much.",The Call of the Wild

524,njbautista-19141,One of the better movies I've seen in a while,9,26 February 2020,"Amazing and inspiring movie for the family.
Don't listen to all the bashing for the CGI, the story is great.
But hey, that's just my first movie review and I'm just some teen and I didn't care at all.
I highly recommend this movie for anyone who haven't watched it.",The Call of the Wild
