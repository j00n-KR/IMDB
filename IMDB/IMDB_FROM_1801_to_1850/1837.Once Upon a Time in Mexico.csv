0,Leofwine_draca,"A light entertainment piece, nothing more or less than that",6,22 September 2016,"The sequel to the vastly superior DESPERADO is a more traditional kind of action movie, but with enough style from Rodriguez (think of offbeat camera-work and bizarre performances), charisma from Antonio Banderas as the smouldering hero, insanity from Johnny Depp in a kooky performance better than that of PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, and brain-dead action to recommend it to thrill-junkies. Once again, we're back in the hot and sweaty city streets south of the border, although this time the plot is far from simple, and instead rather muddled. It involves an evil army general, a plot to overthrow the Mexican president, El Mariachi and his friends plotting revenge, and a psychotic CIA agent who enlists the help of ex-FBI agent Ruben Blades to take down a drug lord who is changing his face. Got that? The cast alone makes this worth watching. Depp's character undergoes the most entertaining – if OTT – transformation, and believe me when I say you've never seen anything like. Banderas doesn't take such a main role here, it being an ensemble piece, but he's indistinguishable from his earlier incarnation in terms of looks and charisma. Salma Hayek returns for a brief series of flashbacks, and Eva Mendes impresses as a cold femme fatale. Not only do Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin return from the last in the series, but we get Willem Dafoe as a sinister drug lord, Mickey Rourke as a Chihuahua-loving hit man and even singer Enrique Iglesias in a lacklustre performance. What more could you possibly want? Well, there's gratuitous violence and black comedy in spades, as well as impressive shoot-outs and some explosive action come the finale. The plot may not be up to much but it certainly moves fast and there's never time to get bored. This is an entertainment piece, nothing more and nothing less, but certainly a film I'll enjoy watching a few more times.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
1,SnoopyStyle,"Violent, convoluted and a fitting end to trilogy",6,19 July 2014,"It's the third of Robert Rodriguez's ""El Mariachi"" trilogy. Belini (Cheech Marin) tells the story of El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) and Carolina (Salma Hayek) who took on general Marquez. Sands (Johnny Depp) carefully listens and pays him $10k. Cucuy (Danny Trejo) takes El Mariachi prisoner. CIA agent Sands (Johnny Depp) tells him to kill Marquez being paid by Barillo (Willem Dafoe) after he kills the president. Ajedrez (Eva Mendes) is an agent tasked to protect the president.It's violent, convoluted, and fitting end to the trilogy. It's stylized shoot-em-up more than any substance. Johnny Depp is dipping into his craziness and has some crazy lines. It feels too random and too chaotic. Instead of staying with El Mariachi, the movie treats him as a mysterious unknowable character. It spends too much time with everybody else. The motives are confused and the story is too complicated. It keeps flashing back and forth. At times, it's hard to tell who he's fighting and why but nobody really cares as long as lots of stuff get blown up.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
2,gavin6942,Great Fun With Banderas and Depp,7,24 March 2013,"Hit-man ""El Mariachi"" (Antonio Banderas) becomes involved in international espionage involving a psychotic CIA agent (Johnny Depp) and a corrupt Mexican general.Roger Ebert wrote, ""Like Leone's movie, the Rodriguez epic is more interested in the moment, in great shots, in surprises and ironic reversals and closeups of sweaty faces, than in a coherent story"". Boy, he could not be more right. If we are going to talk style versus substance, this film has style written all over it: some great visuals, intense scenes... but when it comes to actual substance, the story is not as tight as it could (or should) be.The ""star"" factor is here, with Johnny Depp and Willem Dafoe thrown into the mix, and Depp is certainly quite entertaining... but the dynamic also changes when your focus is less on the Mexican characters and more on this other guy, an outsider. The comedy was also increased greatly, too, and not always appropriately for the type of film it tries to be.Great fun for fans of ""Desperado"", but this is far from Rodriguez's best work.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
3,lee_eisenberg,Well I'll be...,8,18 February 2006,"I haven't seen the first two installments in Robert Rodriguez's ""El Mariachi"" series, but now I think that I know the drill. ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" portrays various and sundry characters trying to take revenge on each other in the midst of a potential revolution. Obviously, that's a loose description, but you can't really understand this movie unless you see it. Granted, this flick is not for the squeamish. Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Johnny Depp, Mickey Rourke, Eva Mendes, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Ruben Blades, and Willem Dafoe all do quite well with their roles - considering that every character exists mainly for the purpose of shooting as many bullets as possible. Rodriguez brings to this movie the same kind of flair for violence that he more recently brought to ""Sin City"".",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
4,jboothmillard,Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6,25 May 2007,"If you remember Desperado, then you may enjoy this sequel made eight years later, from its director Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn, Sin City), apparently remaking his low budget debut El Mariachi. El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) lost his wife Carolina (Salma Hayek) and daughter when they were killed (gun shot) by drug lords, and he has returned not only to stop the new ones, but get revenge on the one who arranged the shooting. Basically, new drug lord Barillo (Willem Dafoe) is pretending to overthrow the Mexican president, and meanwhile, using the Mariachi to help him, corrupt CIA agent Sands (Johnny Depp) is trying to discover whatever he can about their drug lords' plans. Marquez (Gerardo Vigil), the man who killed his family, is with the lords as well. Cucuy (Danny Trujo), the muscle for Sands is keeping tabs on the Mariachi. He however has the help of retired-FBI agent Jorge Ramirez (Rubén Blades) and Lorenzo (singer Enrique Iglesias, mole!) to help him defeat the villains. Also starring Mickey Rourke as Billy, Eva Mendes as Ajedrez, Marco Leonardi as Fideo and Cheech Marin as Belini. It may not have a great story as such, but there is enough gun shooting, chase and action sequences to please people. Good!",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
5,ccthemovieman-1,Just TOOOO Much,5,5 October 2006,"With directors like Robert Rodriguez, a little money is a bad thing.When he had none, and made ""El Mariachi,"" he made a great film. He then obtained a lot of money to make a sequel, ""Desperado,"" which was still fun but way overdone in the violence, explosions, sex, etc., and the story lost what little credibility it had. Now comes the third installment which makes the last movie look believable in comparison to this farce.This is REALLY ludicrous. This story is so stupid, with violence so overdone that it's past ridiculous. You can't even laugh at it, it's such an insult to even the dumbest person's intelligence. What a shame to waste the acting talents of some fun actors, too, like Johnny Depp, Cheech Marin, Eva Mendes, Mickey Rourke, etc. However, most of above-mentioned are whacked-out personalities anyway, so maybe they fit perfectly in a film like this. Forget about Selma Hayak: she's given good billing here but all of her scenes are flashbacks.For the first hour, I could put up with the stupidity of this story solely because of the wild colors and stylish camera-work, but after an hour, this is just too much.....way too much.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
6,rmax304823,Nearly Unbearable.,2,13 January 2018,"A tourist's eye view of a Mexican city, but a beautiful view nonetheless. No squatter's settlements. The churches are rococo, ordinary buildings seem to glow in the golden hour, and inside it's all salmon pink and pale green.That's it. That's the good part.The performances aren't that bad either, as far as that goes, and the cast is professional. Some performers have substantial roles, like the agreeable Antonio Banderas. Others appear to have shown up for one day's work, like Salma Hayek.The plot and direction are a convoluted mess. We are treated to a shoot out or high speed pursuit every few minutes. The stunts are literally incredible. A shotgun blast throws the victim through an arc that, at its apex, is about ten feet from the ground. You'll find more depth in a comic book or a Betty Boop cartoon.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
7,Tweekums,Depp steals the show,7,26 November 2009,"Having really enjoyed ""Desperado"" I looked forward to seeing this film, which is set a few years afterwards, but on first viewing I was disappointed, however as I'd bought the DVD I thought I should give it another go and was glad that I did as I enjoyed it far more second time around.There is plenty of over the top action from start to finish with Antonio Banderas putting in a fine performance as El Mariachi, the guitar playing gunslinger, however Johnny Depp steals the film with his portrayal of CIA agent Sands who has brought El Mariachi out of retirement in order to prevent a coup d'etat. Unfortunately Selma Hayek had a much smaller role than in the previous film despite having second billing. Other notable stars are Willem Defoe, playing a Mexican drug lord, Mickey Rourke who plays a chihuahua carrying American criminal and Eva Mendes as a Mexican police officer.Robert Rodriguez does a good job delivering the action and gets good performances from his cast, at times the story seems a bit light but that doesn't matter too much as it is an action film not ""Citizen Kane"". So grab a beer, put your brain in neutral and enjoy the ride.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
8,ma-cortes,"Nail-biting and zestful action film with eccentric cast , striking set-pieces and irony",6,20 May 2020,"The stoty takes off from and rehashes the second film with flashbacks including Salma Hayek , here El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) becomes involved in a twisted international intrigue involving a lot of strange characters such as : a crooked CIA agent called Sands (Johnny Depp) , a nasty mexican General , a corrupt cop (Eva Mendes) . Meanwhile ,a drug baron (Willem Defoe) is attempting to assassinate the President (Pedro Armendariz Jr) by a complex conspiracy . As Mariachi helps foil the coup'de etat .The time has come.Thrilling action film with plenty of shootouts , explosion , some hilarious touches and lots of violence . It takes parts here and other of other films, and also influenced by Sam Pekinpah , Jackie Chan and Mad Max, too .More a sequel than a loose , biggest budget remake to The Mariachi, this third installment feature may be a rambling derivative exercice in gratuitous violence , but anyway it results to be a gleeful entertainment and really amusing . Motifs and plot points are hardly explained and certain roles are extremely ridiculous and so sketchly drawn that it is difficult to work out why they are there . There is more than enough preposterous pleasure to be had from Rodriguez's expertise with the action set-pieces and absurdist approach to the story's mythical aspirations .This one belongs to Robert Rodriguez's Mariachi trilogy formed by El Mariachi 1992 with Carlos Gallardo, Consuelo Gómez , followed by Desperado 1995 with Antonio Banderas , Salma Hayek , Cheech Marin, Quentin Tarantino ,Steve Buscemi , Joaquin de Almeida , and this one that has a good main and support cast . As it turns out to be an Antonio Banderas recital, as he runs, bounds , shoots and sings splendidly . Accompanied by Johnny Depp as a psychotic CIA agent who becomes a pawn in in drug lord Willem Defoe's bigger scheme and Ruben Blades as a FBI retired agent . While Marco Leonardi and Enrique Iglesias play two Mariachis who join Banderas to carry out a slaughter against villainous people.This self-indulgent mess was well made by Robert Rodriguez who wrote , photographed , produced , edited , scored and directed in two months on digital video and starred by his ordinary friends and familar clan. Rating : 6.5/10 . Bloody good fun",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
9,Quinoa1984,Rodriguez returns to full-throttle movie-making after seven years. A+,10,15 September 2003,"There's something about the world that Robert Rodriguez has created here that works for action fans, and still engages somehow, perhaps just visually, on a kind of intellectual level. Sure they may be dumb fun on the outside, but really, the style here takes control, using impressive digital cameras. And, like the Leone spaghetti westerns that inspired the ""El Mariachi"" series, if one looses track of the story it's not the worst thing that can happen to the viewer's interest), and then throws enough flair and technical excellence in the action/shoot-up set pieces that it keeps us at the least entertained and at the most riveted. Watching Once Upon a Time in Mexico, I felt the more riveted than I had watching a film by Rodriguez since his 1996 horror-sleeper 'From Dusk Till Dawn' (incidentally, co-starring and scripted by Tarantino). While there's some merit to 'The Faculty' (his satisfactory send up of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers'), and his 'Spy Kids' trilogy (which will always be more entertaining to the kids in its following than it will to me), 'Mexico' boasts a return to the energy, and rather cool flamboyance, that went with his early action masterpieces. Basic story (as I could follow it)- it's years after 'Desperado' left off, and El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas in a trademark role) is in hiding after a renegade General killed his wife (Salma Hayek) and daughter. He is brought out, however, by another AWOL type, CIA agent Sands (Johnny Depp, slick enough to be likable in distasteful situations) who wants him to seek vengeance on the General while he gets away with millions of pesos in a deal involving rich, scheming gangsters (i.e. Willem Dafoe) and players playing each side (those of which I won't mention here). But this story is just a baseline, like in the past films in the series, for numerous scenes of violence, mayhem, and surprises both in the characters' actions and in Rodriguez's work - and work here means that he films like a musician that plays five or six instruments at the same time (and, remarkably, he plays each well). The camera work (including operating hand-held cameras), editing, design, and spicy music score are all under the sole control of the director. This is tricky, considering Rodriguez's budget here is slightly larger than Desperado's and much more than his little independent wonder from 1992, but (at least from my perspective) he pulls it off to satisfy his fan base while gaining appeal for those who aren't familiar to his past films. If someone walks into 'Mexico' knowing only who the actors are, and seeing them on that basis, are bound to enjoy more than just the performances (which in and of themselves skim that think line between over the top and subtle sublimely) by the time they leave the theater. Now that doesn't mean those who are fans of the Spy Kids trilogy will immediately like this movie, indeed, those under ten may feel a little queasy over such bloodshed after a while. But for a core action-adventure audience, who've been awaiting a good, solid film after a summer that's been hit and miss, and still waiting for Tarantino's Kill Bill will not be disappointed. Note: one of the fun parts in a film like this is to see two particular actors return from past Rodriguez films, like Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo, and then on top of that to have such recognizable actors in such juicy supporting roles, like Ruben Blades, Mickey Rourke, Enrique Iglesias, Dafoe, and Eva Mendes.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
10,wes-connors,Robert Rodriguez plays a Mexican Hat Trick,4,23 December 2008,"""Leaping back into action, gun-slinging, guitar-toting hero 'El Mariachi' is back in town in 'Once Upon a Time in Mexico', as director Robert Rodriquez delivers the epic final chapter of his pulp western trilogy. Starring Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Johnny Depp, Mickey Rourke, Eva Mendes, Enrique Iglesias, and Willem Dafoe, 'Once Upon a Time in Mexico' is a full-frontal assault,"" according to the DVD sleeve.That's about as good a description of this blood-splattering, testicle-crunching Robert Rodriguez film as you're going to get. Mr. Rodriguez borrows the title, some of the style, but little of the greatness from Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"". Hard to dope it all out.

11,Coventry,More or less what you expect...,5,27 March 2004,"If you start watching ""Once upon a time..."" with limited expectations, you won't be disappointed. I for one only searched for a little bit of adrenaline filled action and lovely performances of an all-star cast. Frankly, that's all there is to it because the screenplay is a complete mess and Rodriguez lacks the inspiration and creativity he once had so much. The story mixes too many intrigues, flashbacks, illogical twists and unfunny humor to be memorable. El Mariachi is now a broken man since they murdered his wife (the still exquisite Salma Hayek), but vengeance is offered him by the FBI. Johnny Depp is the corrupt agent who hires Banderas to eliminate a military General, who happens to be the same guy who killed his wife. Then, there are about 25 other sub-plots that aren't worth mentioning. The violence is well presented and delightfully over the top! Remarkable how the enemies keep aiming for El Mariachi carefully and miss...while Banderas just swings his weapons around without looking and somehow ALWAYS manages to kill a bad boy! The brilliant actors is small roles are the real treat in this film!! We've got Willem Dafoe as über-b***ard numero uno and THE Mickey Rourke as his unmanly sidekick. Rodriguez regulars Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin join the party as well and Eva Mendes is too beautiful to be true. And then there's Johnny Depp who easily overshadows Antonio Banderas as the corrupt Agent Sands...Only Johnny Depp can say stupid lines like ""Are you a Mexi-can or a Mexi-can't"" without losing his coolness. Unlike Enrique Iglesias who confirms here what everyone already knew...acting isn't really his best profession",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
12,michaelRokeefe,Out of isolation comes El Mariachi.,7,30 June 2006,"A playfully dangerous and psychotic CIA agent Sands(Johnny Depp)is involved in international espionage and recruits a mythical guitar-swinging hit-man El Mariachi(Antonio Banderas)to foil an assassination.

Revenge has motivated El Mariachi and he is out for blood. Welcome to the blood bath full of explosive action.Depp could easily be considered the star of the movie. The handsome Banderas is complimented by Hayek...smoldering romance. A very strong cast also features: Cheech Marin, Mickey Rourke, Danny Trejo, Eva Mendes, Willem Dafoe and Ruben Blades. A story line that gets a little confusing is all but forgotten with the exciting gun play and explosions.

13,Theo Robertson,Silly Action Adventure,4,7 August 2010,"OUATIM is the final film in director Robert Rodriguez Mexico trilogy . Roger Ebert described it as a "" A film that is interested in the moment "" and he's right . There is a plot there somewhere that involves Antonio Banderas El Mariachi's assassin being recruited by Johnny Depp as a CIA agent in order to overthrow El Presidente , but this is often ignored as cross , double cross , triple cross , running around getting captured and shoot outs become more prevalent to the narrative . It's a silly film with silly moments so if you're expecting hard hitting plot driven cinema you won't like this . There's a lot of violence too but is so silly it's like watching a cartoon . One can't help thinking a cartoon is better edited though . One problem I had was the action sequences are edited in a bizarre way Actually I had two problems since the cast Banderas , Depp , Enrique Iglesias and Salma Hayek featured prominently in the film's promos . Anyone human being with a pulse and sexual awareness must have been impressed by the raw sexuality of at least one of the cast . Unfortunately red blooded men are poorly served since Ms Hayek appears in a couple of scenes told in flashback which seems something of cheat since she featured heavily in posters for the film . In that case this is the silliest chick flick you'll ever see",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
14,Scarecrow-88,Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6,27 March 2015,"Essentially ""El Mariachi"" (1992) hopped on steroids, ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" is director Robert Rodriguez' third and final chapter in the saga of a guitar toting, double-barrel handgun carrying, vengeance-seeking Latino mariachi gunfighter. You have a coup d'état where a military general (responsible for killing the mariachi's wife and daughter (of course)) wants to secure power over the country's president (who wants the people to be free); the mariachi will go out of his way to see that the general is dead by film's end. Meanwhile, the story also has a drug cartel kingpin (Willem Dafoe, wasted) wanting to shake down the president as well. There's millions of pesos in a church that a corrupt CIA agent (Johnny Depp, easily walking away with the movie and seemingly quipping freely to his heart's content) wants at, with help from a colleague (Eva Mendes) who might be secretly working behind his back (there's a lot of that going on in this movie, let me tell you). Also involved is a ""retired"" FBI agent (Ruben Blades) who has revenge on his mind against the kingpin for murdering his partner years back. Then there's the kingpin's thug (Mickey Rourke) exiled from America due to past criminal activities and wanting to actually get out of his current spot due to all the killing he must be ordered to commit. Got all that? Designed as an epic involving Mexico, this convoluted mess has a hilarious scene where Depp explains what's going on (exposition that ends up confusing us even more) to Mendes, and it just proves that there was way too much emphasis on throwing so much at the viewer when all Rodriguez ultimately cares about is a high body count, guns going off, furniture and walls destroyed, along with plentiful bloodshed and general grisliness. Antonio Banderas returns from ""Desperado"" (1995) as does a gorgeous Salma Hayek (in a glorified cameo), mostly shooting people with little else to do, speaking very limited dialogue. Depp gets his eyes gouged out yet still shoots a guy in the head, while having assistance from a kid with a bicycle that rings a little bell. The blood down each side of his face seems to carry a cartoonish appearance painting him as a type of betrayed superhero! Guitar cases once again shoot out not only bullets but flames like a blow torch! And of course Banderas' mariachi can't miss while everyone else couldn't hit him if they were right up on him. Cheech Marin shows up in an eye-patch for just a moment as a man with information but Depp has to blow him away (and a waitress who spilled drink on his fake arm; don't ask) not long after. Mendes and Hayek may have small roles but both are looking mighty delicious. You want noise? This has it. All that plot just feeds into violence and bullet-riddled extras. Any excuse for Banderas to be on a motorbike or in a pink caddy evading baddies while killing them in droves is used by Rodriguez. This cast, besides Depp (even the menacing Danny Trejo has a minor impact), and maybe Blades, really doesn't have a whole here to sink their teeth into. However, action set pieces and flamboyant use of camera to show how to kill somebody stylishly is Rodriguez' forte.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
15,LeonLouisRicci,Don't Shoot the Chef...His Masterpiece Was Yet to Come,7,18 August 2012,"Great Directors all have a stigma of stature that is inherent to all that excel in their craft. That is, the comparisons to one's own work as opposed to the comparison of one's peers.This is not the Director's best film. It is too derivative and the accentuation of his signature style only dilutes and dismisses its ability to arouse the senses and in effect numb the audience with over kill. More is less sometimes, especially when working from an already stimulated synapses. In this film it is the odd things that work the best. Not the familiar. The reputation for excess need not be pushed further to attain an attractive and more enjoyable ride. The roller-coaster can go off the track if pushed passed the event's horizon.As far as edgy action flick's go, this is better then most. But the Director has his own reputation to live up to. P.S.

16,dbborroughs,Editing by the Blender in the Corner,6,11 March 2004,"While I really like the work of Robert Rodriguez I really must wonder why this movie was made. I'm still not completely certain of what happens or why despite seeing this two times. The lack of coherent  plotting make this a tough film to fully enjoy. Characters come and go with little reason and there is often the sense that this would make sense in a 9 hour version.
The individual sequences that make up the film are wonderfully staged and very funny (I love Johnny Depp and the candy selling kid), but nothing hangs together. Rodriguez has made a film of mind blowing action  but completely failed to stitch the sequences together into a plot that makes anything but fleeting sense.The acting is very good but Depp's cameo as a priest adds a layer of confusion that I don't think was ever suppose to be there.Rent this or watch it on cable before you make any decisions on buying it since odds are good you'll love the parts much more than the whole.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

Was quite interesting and had the makings of a good drama but ultimately just degenerates into a mindless action movie. Antonio Banderas gets top billing but it is Johnny Depp who probably gets more airtime. Plus, Salma Hayek gets second billing, but we don't see much of her, unfortunately. All three deliver good performances, however. Good support from Mickey Rourke, Eva Mendes, Willem Dafoe and Dabby Trejo. Enrique Iglesias can be seen in a minor role.

18,Boba_Fett1138,"Very messy movie that has almost nothing to do with the previous 'Meriachi' movies. Oh well, at least Johnny Depp is still in it.",5,21 December 2005,"Problem with this movie is, is that it's way too messy. The movie features way too many characters and different plot lines which makes the movie unnecessary hard to follow.This movie has almost nothing to do with any of the other 'Mariachi' movies and real main character of this movie is this time portrayed by Johnny Depp, who gets the most screen time and is by far the most interesting character of the movie. He really steals the show in every scene that he is in. The fun feeling and over-the-top action sequences that were overly present in ""Desperado"" are sourly missing here. The movie its story takes itself way too serious and because of that, this movie isn't a particularly entertaining one to watch. It still has plenty of action sequences, both all of those moments feel forced and are made unnecessary silly and unbelievable at times.It's pretty obvious that director Robert Rodriguez his good friend Quentin Tarantino, inspired him for this movie. The story of this movie is 'Tarantino' like and features lots of different odd characters and story lines that are all somehow connected. However Rodriguez simply is no Tarantino and he fails terribly with his story for this movie. He should stick to his own style and that is making movies with an high entertainment value that are very light to watch and always have some good action in it. This movie and its story all feel extremely messy and incoherent and the at times weak editing also doesn't add much good to the movie and its storytelling.This movie is really stuffed with characters and big stars. It's really an overkill in this case and it makes the movie extra hard to follow at times. Sure its fun to see all those well known actors, who I all really like, but it simply doesn't work well for the story and the movie in general.Don't go and see this expecting a ""Desperado 2"". This is a totally different movie with a totally different story and style, that just happens to feature the El Mariachi character in it. Basically his character could had easily been written out of the movie, once you really start thinking about it.A messy movie with a messy story and too many characters and some forced action in it. Thank goodness Johnny Depp is still in this, he saves this movie from being a total disaster and still adds some fun and entertainment value to the movie. 5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Third time's the... well, this",7,3 August 2009,"I have a theory that certain people do best when they are presented with limitations. It forces them to be creative, to think on the spot, and to excise portions of their vision that they simply can't achieve. In my opinion, Robert fits this description. The greatest of his flicks are arguably those that he did with what seems to be too little money and time(well, that one didn't quite come true this time) to pull it off, as well as those he didn't write himself. This was made for about four times the budget of Desperado, and the vast freedom seems to have opened the floodgates. No idea has been turned down, at most it's been changed. The plot is ridiculously complicated and convoluted(don't get me started on the constant twists and turns), and at about 90 minutes, this is actually somewhat straining, and in spite of the overly fast pace(well, in part because of it, this doesn't offer enough time to breathe in-between intense sequences, so the audience becomes overstimulated and after that point, it's just tiring), this feels longer, and not in a good way. Characters are plentiful and quirky, but this series continues to lack proper development, and this is probably the worst of the three in that area. The action is still cool, though they keep trying to make it bigger, and it really isn't as exciting(if usually well-choreographed) as what we got in the predecessors. This does get you to care in the least, I'm sorry to say. The dialog varies, a lot of it is pretty memorable. It's all well-delivered. The acting is impressive, and Depp is fun to watch. There are iconic and awesome moments in this. This gets rather goofy and silly, frequently. It's also weird at points, bordering on the bizarre, moreso than before in these. While they try for humor, it doesn't work as well as the earlier movies in the franchise. Editing and cinematography are well-done, with a couple of odd choices. The DVD holds a handful of trailers, six featurettes that I've reviewed at their respective entries here on the site, deleted scenes with Rodriguez' interesting thoughts as audio, and an informative Director's Commentary track. I recommend this to the fans, and those who dig the spaghetti Western sub-genre. 7/10",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
20,ferguson-6,Cool Pork for the Mex-I-Can,7,19 September 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Director Robert Rodriguez leaves no doubt that this is HIS movie.  Check out the credits.  See if you can count how many times his name shows up.  Not to mention the ""chopped by"" line in the opening.  Anyone who has seen ""El Mariachi"" and ""Desperado"" know that Rodriguez captured the essence of simple plot and stylish action.  ""Mexico"" again provides the stylish action, but this time the plot is convoluted and confusing.  Johnny Depp (on the heels of his Oscar caliber performance in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"") is excellent.  Check out the fine print on his C.I.A. shirt.  He is the funniest killer I remember from the movies. Banderas and especially Salma Hayek have significantly less screen time than in ""Desperado"", but there is so much going on that you don't really notice until it is all over.  The under utilized Ruben Blades again proves to be a joy to watch on screen and Mickey Rourke adds a nice touch.  Willem Dafoe is the only miscast actor in the film, but we can overlook it because he is always an easy guy to despise.  There is often a fine line between being fun/witty and the over the top slapstick.  This one teeters over the line at times.  I did love the Depp sunglass collection (in fact his wardrobe is a hoot). The motorcycle chase scene was just ridiculous and should have been cut out.  Loved the whole Depp/pork thing.  Gotta love anyone that is as dedicated to a singular dish as he is.  The plot is a mess, but the stylish action sequences help us stay interested.  There were times the sound seemed to rip through my chest.  Banderas is a very physical presence and this was not utilized quite as well as in ""Desperado"", but he still just wreaks coolness.  And OK, I am not gay ... not that there is anything wrong with it... but I am secure enough in my manhood to say that Banderas, Enrique Iglesias and Johnny Depp have to be 3 of the prettiest guys ever in the same movie!

21,anaconda-40658,Third Time's A Charm.,8,11 September 2015,"Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003): Dir: Robert Rodriguez / Cast: Antonio Banderas, Johnny Depp, Selma Hayek, Ruben Blades, Eva Mendes: Third film in the El Mariachi trilogy is an action film about time and place with mystic bandit El Mariachi's reputation with a guitar case that shelters a very large gun. Johnny Depp plays a corrupt C.I.A. agent who seeks Mariachi for a proposition that will regard protecting the Mexican President as well as avenging the death of his wife. Directed by Robert Rodriguez who details the film with striking characters. Antonio Banderas returns as Mariachi whose guitar produces beautiful music as well as a parade of bullets. Excellent supporting work by Depp who will realize that his mission has been compromised and suffers consequences. While despairing, Depp deals with these consequences as a strength. Selma Hayek as Mariachi's wife is seen in flashbacks and is given an exhilarating scene where both escape while joined by chain, and both hurl downward using the chain in swinging momentum. Ruben Blades plays a cop avenging the murder of his partner and gets far more than he bargained for. Eva Mendes has a great poisonous presence ready to stick the knife into anyone who stalls her plans. Well crafted bloodshed and brutality yet it portraits the ugly lifestyles that likely won't live happily ever after. Score: 8 / 10",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

Antonio Banderas,(El Mariachi) played the role of a man with a broken heart after his wife and child were killed needlessly and from then on El Mariachi went into hiding or retirement. Salma Hayak,""After the Sunset"",'04 was extremely beautiful and red hot sexy and also very dangerous to anyone who messed around with her, she could put them in their place with one big hit to the groin. Johnny Depp,(Sands), and Mickey Rourke,(Billy) gave great supporting roles, and it was funny watching Mickey Rourke holding a small dog in his arms almost in every scene and playing a rather low key character. Salma Hayak and Antonio Banderas had a great scene together on a fire-scape and holding onto dear life with each other, she even wore a dress during all these upside down stunts.

""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" wastes a fine cast and high end state-of-the-art production on a jumbled, convoluted mess of a movie. Bandaras, hero and ""El Mariachi"",  is buried in a sea of drug cartel heavies, military, agents, innocents, etc. while Hayek only has a few lines and is relegated to a handful of flashbacks. More is not always more, smarter is better than harder, and you can't force creativity. When will they learn? For diehard action junkies only. (C+)",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
27,MovieAddict2016,I'm glad Rodriguez took Tarantino's advice (he suggested the title)...,6,20 December 2003,"The story behind the title of ""Once Upon a Time in America"" has almost become infamous by now, but I'll explain it to those readers who may not know already.Robert Rodriguez, who rose to fame with ""El Mariachi,"" was trying to think of an appropriate title for the final installment in his Mariachi trilogy. Quentin Tarantino (""Pulp Fiction"") recommended the title ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico."" Why? His favorite director, Sergio Leone, the man who inspired him to make films in the first place, crafted a little film once called ""Once Upon a Time in the West,"" not to mention his final motion picture, ""Once Upon a Time in America,"" which is one of the best films ever, and certainly a terrific gangster film by any account.And so here we have it, ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico,"" the long-awaited ending of the Mariachi trilogy. The film is the ultimate spaghetti western tribute, shot like one of Sergio's old low-budget movies. It cost $32 million more than his second El Mariachi film, ""Desperado,"" but it's still a pretty low budget compared to most action films on the market.The most admirable thing about this film is its style. It looks great! It was ""chopped, shot and scored"" the film, as the unconventional credits inform us, using a Sony 24-fps digital Hi-Definition camera. Great! The film perfectly catches the bleak, dry outlook on Mexico -- and it is, along with the extravagant, overblown special effects, the best aspect of the film.The plot isn't. It takes a lot of twists and turns, but I couldn't care less, since I was lost in the first ten minutes. This film moves like a bullet -- blunt, fast, and furious, and it certainly doesn't take its time to accentuate the elements of the plot.Rodriguez has never been one for a good plot. He likes things over the top and fast, with awkward cuts, but it's popcorn movie heaven for any person who wants to just sit back, relax, and have a good time.I'll try to explain the plot as best I can, but it'll be hard. Here we go...CIA Agent Sands (Johnny Depp) is trying to prevent the assassination of the Mexican ""presidente,"" and so he enlists El (Antonio Banderas) to kill Barillo (Willem Dafoe all greased up like a Mexican). Only Sands is a corrupt agent -- his real intention is to get his hands on some dough left over by Barillo after he dies.Plot twists upon plot twists amount, and there were so many that I had trouble following the film. The screen I viewed it on was bleak and dark, but the digital camera's effects could still be made out, and that was really the thing that kept my interest.There was a particular scene where Agent Sands walked into the back kitchen of a restaraunt and put a bullet in the chef's head that felt like it was shot on a home video camera -- a trace of fake blood even remained on the camera after the cook went down. Stuff like this is a new kind of mainstream filmmaking, and the ultimate ""fun movie,"" so to speak.Don't get me wrong. Rodriguez is a long way from making a coherent or important motion picture like Tarantino and Leone, but he is the master of popcorn movies, having made little treats like ""Spy Kids"" and such films by the age of 35. He even wrote a script for ""Predator 3,"" which never got made, and I'm sort of glad -- he would have made it into an overblown action fest like ""Predator 2,"" which was a disappointing enough entry into the series. But now they've got Paul W.S. Anderson ressurecting both ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" series together, based on the videogame and comic book series, which makes me think I would have preferred Rodriguez in the first place.The point is, his films aren't majestic or nearly as smart as they could be. But they're fun, fast, brutal, blunt, cool. Depp, as Agent Sands, is on a winning streak, while support from Mickey Rourke, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Ruben Blades and Eva Mendes provides plenty of celebrity appeal -- oh, and there are flashbacks of El's dead wife (Salma Hayek), who is credited above Johnny Depp and smacked on the front of the film posters in, I can only assume, an effort to attract male audience members as an added bonus. (Robert Rodriguez picture? Depp with a machine gun? Overblown action sets? Salma Hayek? Popcorn movie heaven!)Depp has been around since ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" and with 2003's ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" he finally broke into the mainstream (cult films by Tim Burton have mainly been his resume so far). The thing is, we rarely see Depp himself on-screen -- in ""Edward Scissorhands"" he was the social outcast, quiet and disturbed, muttering only a handful of lines. In ""Ed Wood"" he was channeling the Worst Director of All Time. In ""Sleepy Hollow"" he was putting on the olden days act, and in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" he was the drunken British pirate.Depp is rarely actually Depp. Even in ""Nick of Time"" he was the silent businessman, very out of character from his very suave self. Here Johnny gets to finally have loads of fun, be his cool self, and show off his flair for action films. He's both the comic relief and the guy you wish would get a role as an action hero some day.I didn't leave ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" with any strong feelings towards the film, and it seemed a bit too long and fast for its own good, but it certainly looks great and is fun to watch. This is an unpretentious action film with great style and execution. Oh, and Depp is still the man. Somebody get this guy a John McClane, and hurry up already.3.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

29,Red-Barracuda,"Good characters, cartoonish action, messy plot",5,28 October 2016,"Once Upon a Time in Mexico is director Robert Rodriguez's third, and final, film in the trilogy which began with El Mariachi (1992) and continued with Desperado (1995). This is a series of films which have progressively gotten more expensive and slick but also less good as they have went on. The extreme lo-fi nature of the first movie combined with Rodriguez raw talent led to a very good film, where the sheer restrictions in production values forced the film-maker to try harder to make things work. By the time we have reached Once Upon a Time in Mexico we now have elaborate action scenes sprinkled throughout and a very good cast at its disposal. I realise that the over the top action scenes that are found in this one and its predecessor Desperado are loved by many, yet I personally preferred the less cartoonish approach of the first film; sometimes bigger is not always better.The film as a whole actually works pretty well for the first half. There are a lot of characters in this one, in fact it could reasonably be called an ensemble film; the El Mariachi character is really not the main focus, I would say, if anything, it's Johnny Depp's rogue CIA agent. Depp is in actual fact the best thing about this one, although in fairness all the actors are really pretty good here. The trouble is that the movie becomes less enjoyable in the second half due to a quite messy plot. It felt like an alarming amount of screen time had characters delivering exposition-based dialogue in order to propel the plot forward. It got a bit tedious really and probably is a result of bad script writing as this is a movie that feels like it has a convoluted narrative, even though you sort of know that its plot is probably basic as hell. For what it's worth, the action set-pieces have been delivered with some technical ability, probably the best has to be the sequence where Banderas and Salma Hayek escape from a high storey of a hotel while chained together; the scene has no real relevance to anything and is certainly thrown in on the basis that it was a cool idea that Rodriguez wanted to do but, whatever the case, it is a well-executed bit of action nonsense for sure.My feeling by the end of this one was that it was only okay, yet was a film with a few good things about it.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

31,Buddy-51,"all flash, little substance",4,17 August 2005,"With ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico,"" director Robert Rodriguez returns to his ""El Mariachi"" roots - but unlike the prodigal son, this particular homecoming provides little cause for celebration. Rodriguez' signature style is visual inventiveness combined with wise guy humor and cartoon violence. The problem is that his films rarely have the depth of content to go along with all that directorial razzmatazz. As a result, they tend to become little more than empty, cold exercises in style - and ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" is no exception.The film is obviously intended as some sort of satire on the kind of governmental and political corruption that has plagued that North American country since the Spaniards first set foot on Mexican soil. The messy, overcomplicated plot involves a vicious drug cartel's planning to stage a coup d'etat against the current government, and a murderous CIA agent's working behind the scenes pulling the strings of all the parties involved. Just trying to keep all the plot lines and characters straight requires a program and a score card. Antonio Banderas heads an all-star cast that includes Salma Hayek, Mickey Rourke, Enrique Iglesias, Cheech Marin, Willem Dafoe and Ruben Blades, but the only person who gets to do any real ACTING is Johnny Depp as the gringo CIA agent, but even he is reduced to self-mimicry after awhile. Moreover, the tone of the film is so dispassionate, so flip and arch that we find ourselves completely detached from what's taking place on screen.""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" is one of those films in which the actors spend most of their time winking at the camera to let us know that they're in on the joke, and the director performs somersaults with his camera to keep reminding us of just how ""cool"" and ""with it"" he is. Unfortunately, all style and no substance makes Robert a very dull filmmaker.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
32,cherold,"the well isn't entirely dry, but it's awfully shallow",6,27 November 2004,"The problem with Rodriguez's Mariachi trilogy is it's not so much a thematic trilogy exploring different aspects of a basic concept or telling a story too big to be told in one movie; it's just making the same basic movie over and over. By the third movie you feel like you've seen it all before, only last time you saw it it wasn't quite this confusing. It's not a bad movie, its got a decent pace, some good action scenes and a nice performance by Depp as a psychopathic CIA agent, but the movie doesn't have real forward propulsion, instead stuttering forward in bursts then stalling briefly then bursting forth again. The story feels half-baked and filled with too many characters without enough character development in the entire movie for even one character, and it all feels more like an excuse for a bunch of action scenes than an actual movie. Which would be fine if it was a series of mind-blowing action scenes, but it's more a few really good action moments and a bunch of okay ones. This is not to say that it's a lot worse than Desperado, but it adds nothing to the formula and feels like a tired retread. I give it 6/10, although it could have got a 7 out of me if the ending hadn't been even more garbled than the rest of it.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
33,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The Mariachi deserved more.,4,21 March 2021,"'Once Upon A Time In Mexico (2003)' is an absolute mess. I mean, its plot is barely coherent. Seriously, I'd struggle to describe it right now and I only watched it last night. There are just so many moving parts and poorly explained twists, with most characters having hidden motives and midway changes of heart. Banderas' gunslinging guitar player and his journey for revenge get totally lost amidst a sea of ruthless - and potentially corrupt - CIA agents, local militias, drug cartels, plastic surgeons, FBI retirees and presidential protectors. It really doesn't do justice to the Mariachi character first seen in Rodriguez's debut feature. It feels rather amateur, in a way, and its digital cinematography simply seems 'cheap'. Even its action is disappointing, with far-too-fast editing and hard-to-follow choreography. The film just isn't all that fun. It's not terrible, but it sort of washes over you; nothing here has a proper impact. It's not boring, as such, but it's just so difficult to follow and generally uninspiring that you can't really care about anyone - or anything - you see on screen.

I wonder how such a gathering of skilled actors, and how all the money that was put in the production could not result in anything else but a confusing story, that seems to be longer and less interesting as the watching time passes.  The story happens in a kind of atemporal Mexico, which puts together all the clichees you may know about that country - or at least about the way it is represented in movies. However, the action never gets clear and coherent, the jokes or parody are completely lost. Some of the irony and humor that plays well in French movies for example does not fit the big Hollywood movies. It is not a bad film, I find nothing wrong with the comics inspired movies - it is just that it is a complete bore - 4/10 on my personal scale..",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

39,Anonymous_Maxine,"Note to everyone who saw this movie (yeah you too, Mr. Rodriguez)  there is more to Mexico and Mexicans than blood, crime, murder, suffering, and death. Just so you know.",3,3 February 2004,"Once upon a time in Mexico, there was born a person named Robert Rodriguez, who later moved to the United States and began making movies. He became famous for making an ultra-low budget but high profit cult classic, which he later followed with a fairly higher-budget, fairly less relative profit, fairly less quality film about the same gunslinger, which he now follows up with a massive budget, low-profit, almost nonexistent quality film based on and in Mexico, the country in which he was born, and is yet a film that is about as Mexican as Taco Bell. Note: Robert Rodriguez was born and raised in Texas, and so presumably was not born in Mexico and never moved to the United States. Everything else up there is true, though.I was really saddened by the ridiculous spectacle that Robert Rodriguez's Mariachi movies have become. El Mariachi was a classic Mexican western that became famous because of its deceptively tiny budget and it's resulting dedicated cult fan base, Desperado was a lot of fun, even though the action and shootout scenes were so outlandish that they were funnier than they were exciting, but the story, the acting, the script, the characters, and the FEEL of the movie made it entertaining. Now we have this.Once Upon A Time In Mexico is Rodriguez's version of John Woo's Windtalkers, an awful action film that belittles the Japanese World War II soldiers by treating them like mindless pop-up targets, running onscreen and into oncoming fire seemingly just so they can get shot. They hold their rifles like batons, not making the slightest attempts to cover themselves before being blown away by Nicholas Cage, who is standing in a fixed position and spraying machine-gun fire at all the bad guys jumping out of the bushes.
In Once Upon A Time In Mexico, while there are not massive amounts of violent Mexican deaths (note: there are), at least the majority of them are not there just to get killed. Several of the bloody deaths apparently mean something. The problem is the way that Mexicans are presented (I know, I know, gag you, right?). Maybe I sound like a grumpy old lady, but being Hispanic myself, I tend to have a problem with a movie that presents nothing but Mexicans and seemingly the only person who never kills anyone is the 9-year-old kid that gets the bubble-gum he's trying to sell knocked out of his hand so he can help a characters new to the films curiously named Sands (recently blinded by the bad guys) to locate and kill his pursuer.
The overall plot of the movie, much like the two that preceded it, is not all that important. There are times when the movie pauses between frantic shootouts to drop in a note about how the story is moving along, and then we get another frantic shootout. The essential points are clear enough  El Mariachi is mourning (often violently) the shooting deaths of his wife and daughter, and Sands (Johnny Depp), evidently a C.I.A. agent (who uses irony to cover his identity, wearing t-shirts that say C.I.A. in great big letters), wants him to help stop a plot to assassinate the Mexican president by a drug lord named Barrillo (performed by a horribly miscast Willem Dafoe). These little pauses for breath are overshadowed by such things as gunshots that result in clownish pyrotechnics, sending the unfortunate bullet recipients flying backwards as though hit by a truck, a remake of the famous scene in El Mariachi where Antonio and Salma ride a cable across a street and onto a moving bus (this one obviously more expensive, given the scene's outcome), and genuinely laughable scenes like Antonio and Salma repelling down the side of a building, chained together at the wrist, while one person swings down, then the other person above lets go and swings down to the next level. Creative, but I generally tend to prefer at least the TINIEST bit of believability in the movies, whatever their genre.It's interesting to watch the way El Mariachi, Desperado, and Once Upon A Time In Mexico have evolved as their respective budgets have skyrocketed. Unfortunately, they seem to have changed more in the direction of explosive, bizarre action sequences that find themselves more and more removed from reality with each passing movie. The latest installment is an insult to the country in which is takes place, but at least there are lots of explosions and killing and torture. The El Mariachi saga is, unfortunately, heading downhill pretty quick.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

Better watch the brilliant ""Desperado"" instead...",6,15 February 2021,"Better watch the brilliant ""Desperado"" from the same director instead, because this sequel movie was made with very little money and I think that is the main cause of this movies story structure being all over the place. They simply had no money to re-shoot any scenes, so they tried to solve missing scenes by fast editing and lots of use of slowmotion. All this cheap fast editing and slowmotion stuff got on my nerves after 20 minutes into the movie.
The bad: no good (or even understandable) story structure. There is a lot of killing going on, but I am never cheering for any of the characters, because they are all alike and I dont have a clue who is doing what.More bad: there are no clear good and bad guys. And the supposed bad guys arent convincing and the good guy is rather laughable. Bummer.Not any good? It is a cartoon, made into a movie. It has some funny parts for those who like this sort of cartoon like violence.Could have been a lot better, but that is the problem with lots of Roberto Rodriguez movies.

43,elshikh4,The Bad Nonsense !,1,28 November 2008,"Notice the director's confession at the start that this is ""Robert Rodriguez's Flick"". He could mean it as the blow up's sound more than a nick name for movie. So that's how he told us all about it earlier. This is not a drama; it's a visual and sonic noise. And you know what? It wasn't amusing too!Hollywood used to make a lot of nonsense. (Rodriguez) came in the 1990s to make his share of the noisiest ""Flicks"". And with his fellow maniac (Quentin Tarantino), they became (Spielberg) and (Lucas) of the 1990s. However, both of them specialized in making some fierce, rated-R, B-movies where you'd find some nasty violence, twisted scripts, and twisted sense of humor, homage to the action movies legacy, with unstoppable shootouts without so much to ask about.Though here, the only thing to hit the mark was that dark sarcastic sense, which was clear through the running theme of killing, or hurting so many people for the most trivial reasons: the Guitar's buyer at the beginning got killed because he doesn't know where El Mariachi was, the piano's teacher got his fingers cut off because a remark that he said and the evil guy didn't like, the Mexican cook must die simply because he cooks fine which somehow threatens the American restaurants, so the CIA man kills him to maintain the equilibrium. It's a bright touch of black comedy about the cheapness of the human in the modern times. And this bloody taste for jokes made me smell (Tarantino) around, who was indeed part of the script before leaving to finish (Kill Bill - 2003, 2004). So, save the music of the opening credits, which was very good and regrettably promising, everything was ugly, disgusting, over the top, and idiotically pedant.Well, the worst of it, else pulling (Depp)'s eyes out in one scene!, is its awful try to make many storylines and characters like an epic western. (Rodriguez), hideously, was taken by (Sergio Leone)'s (Once Upon a Time in the West - 1968), so he tried to make something like it, even with similar title, which succeeded eventually in giving us some hard time, and disturbing Mr. (Leone) in his grave as well!(Rodriguez), as its director and writer, failed utterly in imitating anything, or even making something separately that good. It shamefully wasn't strong, attractive, nor coherent at least like what the original (Desperado - 1995) tried to be. Maybe America back in the mid-1990s was ready and eager to some Latino spices, but in 2003, it seemed out of date already, or surely out of accuracy.The plot is a pathetic manipulation of (Desperado)'s elements and (Sergio Leone)'s worlds. This version of epic western wannabe was so adolescent, first-rate dense, and sunk quickly before the half of it. Forget completely about dramatic, satiric, or funny anything. It was perfectly foolish image after another, with great fabrication and assured boredom. This massively shoddy script looked stricken by dotage, the lowest bottom it could hit was the sequence of (Salma Hayek); that what I call the main dish in this nonsense feast!(Banderas) makes me feel really bad since he insists on being the dullest Hollywood star ever, repeating himself as the Latino Mariachi, Zorro,.. whatever, wasting his life between low and average B-movies till watching him in a good movie became rare coincidence. I may sue the Razzie award's organizers since they didn't nominate (Enrique Iglesias) for the worst acting in the 21st century. (Depp) seemed smart, knowing what kind of movie he was making, so he didn't make much effort. The action was absurd and idiot like nearly everything and everyone. I hate to watch a movie that has zero respect for my mind like this. It's one of the most horrific nonsense Hollywood ever made in the last 10 years. I think maybe (Rodriguez) became vain or stupid or both!(Once Upon a Time in Mexico) is close to surreal nightmare more than the uproarious flick. However, I can't think of another nightmare that gave me a headache as bad as this.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
44,dee.reid,Trouble's a brewin' in Mexico...,7,14 September 2003,"As far as movie sequels go this summer, I have to say that ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" is an honest if not somewhat disappointing effort.  ""Mexico"", which is the follow-up to 1995's ""Desperado"", is an exhilarating and violent effort for director Robert Rodriguez, but it's lacking in too many places. 
I've waited a long time for this movie and I even bought the special edition DVD of ""Desperado"" two weeks ago.  I treated myself to ""Mexico"" as a birthday present and I went in with high expectations.  First the good. Johnny Depp certainly has my vote for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, as he chews up a lot of the scenery here as a corrupt CIA agent. Robert Rodriguez shows here that he is growing into a mature filmmaker, paying homage to the many Sergio Leone westerns of the 60s and 70s.  The action is pretty violent and the editing is good.  Now the bad.  Banderas is ok, but you never see much of him, which is what I found to be most disappointing.  This is his movie, but he's in the background for too long and Salma Hayek's performance is actually more of a cameo since she's only in three or four scenes in the whole movie.  The movie suffers most from too much going on at once.  I counted at least three different story lines in this movie and many times the plot comes off as a cluttered mess.Aside from these faults, ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" is an ok effort and is entertaining but is ultimately a disappointment.  7/10",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

The movie is not that bad but if we compare with previous two movies the movie disappointments, the movie have a bunch of talented actors who somewhat either underutilized or were not up to their full potential.The plot of the movie continues where Desperado ends. The plot is straight but with lots of characters in the movie the execution of the movie is somewhat looks sloppy. The climax of the movie is brutal and effective but screenplay could've been little better with some fine tuning as screenplay also looks sloppy although still manages to keep the viewers intact.Acting is majorly good and Antonio Benderas was again very much effective but somewhere I felt that he has been underutilized in this movie. Johnny Depp was a surprise entry and entertains whenever he is on-screen. Salma Hayek was majorly shown in flashbacks, Willem Dafoe and Mickey Rourke was somewhat underused. Eva Mendes was effective. Rest of the characters were also good.Overall OUATIM is an entertaining movie but somewhat disappoints when being compared to it's predecessors.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
46,NateWatchesCoolMovies,My favourite of Rodriguez's films,10,16 June 2015,"Robert Rodriguez's Once Upon A Time In Mexico is an unapologetic, blazing shotgun blast of a movie. When Rodriguez asked his pal Quentin Tarantino how to finish off his El Mariachi trilogy, Tarantino's advice was: it's gotta be big, it's gotta be epic, and it's gotta be called Once upon a time in Mexico. Good advice. This is Rodriguez's Good The Bad and The Ugly, his magnum opus, and my favourite in his line of eclectic films. Antonio Banderas reprises his role as the Mariachi, a brooding, revenge fuelled gunfighter thrown headlong into a lot to assassinate El Presidente, masterminded by a kooky rogue CIA agent, played by Johnny Depp in a role originally written for George Clooney. Depp plays him like Bugs Bunny, relishing every odd line and quirky mannerism. Willem Dafoe is hysterical, sporting a glossy tan and priceless Mexican accent as a ruthless cartel, Mickey Rourke steals the show his second in command, and Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Salma Hayek in flashbacks, Eva Mendes and other Rodriguez regulars make impressions as well. Rodriguez stages every action sequence with a sweaty, frantic grace. He does double duty as cinematographer as well, and every frame is filled with gorgeously shot digital mayhem. He really is an impressive director, rigorously taking on every aspect of his filmmaking process, from the storyboard to the editing room. Here he creates a loving ode to the archetypal action picture, a super fun, violence filled, south of the border shoot out, and one of my favourite action movies.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

I then saw Desperado, and loved the great backup cast and action, but the plot was lacking. This one makes up for what the other two didn't have. I missed Buscemi, but Depp delivered in a more main role than Banderas, who's still getting over the death of his wife, Carolina(Hayek). Director Rodriguez must have a cast he likes, because Marin, Trejo and Larriva all appeared in different roles, and Banderas and Hayek returned the same. It's like a western Mexican film, and I recommend it to all.My rating:8/10",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
48,ShootingShark,Rip-Roaring Mexican Western Hurtles Along As Fast As The Flying Bullets,6,17 February 2007,"Sands, a crooked CIA agent, hires El Mariachi, a notorious Mexican gunfighter, to assassinate an army major, but only after a planned military coup has taken place. Also involved are an overzealous lady cop, El's two goofy brothers, a bigshot drug cartel head and a retired Fed who has been after him for years. Oh, and did I mention the major killed El Mariachi's wife some years before ?The third in Rodriguez' Mariachi trilogy (the others being El Mariachi and Desperado) is easily the flashiest, craziest and most fun, but - and I very rarely say this - is maybe just a bit too bananas for me. It's great; the performances are wonderful (particularly Depp and Blades), the delirious story is mesmerising and there are three stunning action scenes - the chained-together escape from the hotel, the showdown in the church and the gun-battle that turns into a motorbike chase - before the apocalyptic finale. What slightly lets it down for me though is that the two story threads - El Mariachi vs Major Marquez and Jorge vs Barillo - don't really tie together, and there are so many main characters I'm not sure what their relationships are or who to identify with ? Banderas is the avenger, Blades is the man with a mission, Dafoe is buying a new life, Armendariz is the man in charge, Trejo is the go-between, Rourke is double-crossing Dafoe, Mendes is double-crossing Depp and Depp is double-crossing everyone. It's fun, but it's hard to keep up, and not always in a good way. Depp is obviously having a whale of a time (""Are you a Mexi-Can, or a Mexi-Can't !?""), but for my money the best performance is Blades (an underrated actor and musician - check him out in Homeboy and The Two Jakes), who brings sanity and continuity to the proceedings but is still great fun to watch. There are obvious comparisons between Rodriguez' westerns and the classic Italian spaghettis of the sixties, but while Sergio Leone would hold a shot three times longer than a standard Hollywood film, Rodriguez goes the opposite way, and as a result this film isn't as good for me. It's still pretty unmissable though. Incidentally, I'm fairly sure this is the only major studio movie where five of the main technical/creative roles - director, writer, cameraman, composer and editor - were handled by the same man (though Peter Hyams' 2010 and some of Clint Eastwood's films come close). 6/10",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
49,Movie-ManDan,"Despite Inconsistency, This Movie Still Rules!",10,7 April 2015,"The last chapter of Robert Rodriguez's Mariachi trilogy has poor connections to the previous films, but has arguably the best storyline. This has everything that makes a movie enjoyable and ownable.In the most complex premise of the series, General Marquez has been hired by the Barillio Cartel drug family to assassinate the Mexican government. Crooked CIA Agent Sands (Depp) hires El Mariachi (Banderas) and retired FBI agent (Blades) to make sure Marquez and Barillio don't consume power. We get an insight with El's relationship to the bad guys: Carolina (Hayak) was Marquez's girl and she put a bullet through his heart, but he survived. He shoots her, her daughter and El, with El surviving. Two reasons why this doesn't work: first, our central character seek vengeance for the death of his loved one again, rehashing Desperado's storyline. The next reason this doesn't work is Marquez: where does he fit? In Desperado, Carolina is a young woman who works under drug lord Bucho and is one of his groupies. Did she know Marquez before Bucho? Carolina's death takes place several years after Desperado and the movie itself takes place a few years after that. Given the time frame and Carolina's relationship with Marquez and Bucho in both movies, it is hard to tell how it all fits. A similar problem was encountered in Desperado with El avenging Domino's death by trying to kill Bucho, who had nothing to do with her death. Anyway, throughout the movie characters are introduced and swerves happen all over the place in all subplots. There's too many to keep track of and they become confusing. I had to watch this movie a few times before fully understanding it. In a way, complexity like this is good. Many people criticized this for all the swerves and subplots, but I thought it was great. El isn't pushed down to a minor role like people say, other subplots just build later on in the film.Aside from the story, the acting by all is good. Johnny Depp steals the show, giving one of his best performances ever. He plays a charismatic CIA agent who plays by his own rules. He is totally awesome. I think they should have given him his own spin off. This was before he started playing the same dumb characters in Tim Burton movies. Depp is best known for a wide variety of odd characters, all of which are easy to play. As an actor myself, I can assure that the weirder and funnier and character is, the easier it is to play. When Depp plays Sands, he is a realistic foul-mouthed smart-alec. The more realistic a character is, the harder it is to play. Ironic.Another bit of criticism I'd give is the action. All three movies are best-known for having heavy violence, but this seems to take a back seat to Desperado. Desperado had phenomenal shootouts. This also has great action, but it lacked in the same raw and artistic action that Desperado had. it did not lose its edge, it just softened a bit.This rules!3.5/4",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
50,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A sequel that could've worked but doesn't focus on its main character,6,8 May 2012,"Sequels to franchises fail all the time in cinema history. And there are many factors that are involved with this downfall but they all have something in common. The lack of care taken into consideration for the main character of the story. Sometimes it's less character development, and sometimes it's because the whole plot is turned upside down on the main character. But what this specific film does is almost ignore the presence of its main character completely!After having a successful run releasing El Mariachi (1992) and Desperado (1995), it was time for director Robert Rodriguez to finish his famous trilogy. And it's hard to believe that this film would do badly because it has the same director and the same actors right? But somehow, it still manages to pull off as being obnoxious. Antonio Banderas is back as ""El"", the once ruthless killer who swore revenge on Bucho, who had his wife murdered (Desperado (1995)). Now, he's back but this time to kill a man named General Marquez. Why does El Mariachi need to kill another man? Didn't he get his revenge? The answer is yes to all these questions. So what's the revenge for? The vital information that the viewer is missing is quite important. I'm not one for spoiling films but this has to be addressed. El Mariachi is going to kill Marquez because the general killed Carolina, Salma Hayek's character. Now for any viewer who really likes her character better not be surprised when Hayek's character is barely in this film. It truly is a disappointment because the intro to this sequel is really exciting. Even the trailer to this film is also very deceptive,...it makes it look like Salma Hayek's character actively participates in it. Just kidding.Besides this though, the real problem lies in how the story was executed. Johnny Depp also stars in this film as a C.I.A. agent who, in his eyes, is ""restoring the balance to the country"". It's a fine idea and all but the story becomes so focused on Depp's plan, than it is, on its anti-hero, El Mariachi. Depp does have some funny lines but it's almost like Antonio Banderas' character took a back seat in this film. It's actually quite unsettling because El Mariachi is what made the franchise what it was; not some stuck-up C.I.A. agent. Desperado was a simple story about a man looking for revenge. This is about another man needing a man to get revenge on an enemy so another man can take power. Confusing no?Everything else is fair in this movie. The script still has its moments of comedy, bloody action and loud gunshots. The only difference is that there just doesn't seem like there's enough of it because the camera isn't focused on El Mariachi all the time. The music is also still a joy to listen to because of all the Hispanic tunes. This movie isn't a bad film,...but it definitely could have been much better.Once Upon a Time in Mexico tries to replicate the over the top action from its predecessors but it's bogged down with too much story and not enough of ""El"". Plus, with the lack of vital plot points, some fans may be highly disappointed with the end result.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
51,Rob_Taylor,"Half good, and half bad..",6,20 May 2004,"Having watched the two earlier films days before watching this one, I'm not sure quite what I expected. The plot to Once.. is very similar to the other two movies, with a few little twists thrown in for good measure. Whether or not Rodriguez tried to do something a little different deliberately, or whether it just turned out that way is not clear to me. Either way, Once.. is subtly different from its predecessors, and not necessarily in a bad way, but neither in a good way.For instance, in Once.. we have the Mariachi (Banderas) as before, but here he seems almost relegated to a co-starring role, instead of being centre stage. A number of new characters such as Depp's manic CIA agent and an ex-FBI agent are given little sub-plots of their own which, whilst tying into the story as a whole, detract somewhat from the enjoyment of the movie.In fact, the first half of the film is rather plodding as plots and characters are developed. The second half, when the action hots up, saves the movie from being bad, but leaves you feeling that things could have been evened out somewhat between the two halves of the movie without too much effort.Hayek is relegated to ""I remember when..."" dream sequences that Banderas has, which, in retrospect are probably unnecessary except to serve as a way for you to find out her fate, which could have been accomplished just as handily, though less entertainingly, perhaps, with a monologue by Banderas.Rodriguez has tried to do something a little different with the combat scenes, too. They have been made more cartoonish and less realistic (though still with plenty of gore). People who are shot now fly through the air somewhat comically. Again, not necessarily bad, but different from what we are used to from the first two movies.Overall, the movie is entertaining enough, particularly after the hour mark, but not as good as either of its predecessors, in my opinion. Worth watching though, at least once, but maybe not more than that.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

53,winner55,"more film, less Tarentino - please",8,25 June 2006,"Prefatory note, added after reading reviews about two other films: In 1998, Carlos Gallardo - the original El Mariachi - made two films, Bravo, a straight action film, and Single Action, a post-modern remake of Sergio Leone's For a Few Dollars More, which he also directed. I strongly suggest viewing these two lesser known films. Robert Rodriguez borrows heavily from the stories and ideas of these films for the making of OUTIM, and knowing this reminds us that Rodriguez still owes a debt to the Mexican film community, which he occasionally appears to deny. -I wish two things for Robert Rodriguez: First that he would get the hell away from Quentin Tarantino - who, although a fine filmmaker himself, is clear just an evil influence on Rodriguez (his presence basically ruined Desperado) - and second, that he would stop complaining about the medium and just to get to work using it.I really love this film; but except for the deleted scenes, the additional material on the DVD, and all the silly comments Robert Rodriguez has made about using video and CGI instead of film, are a waste of my time and his. Self-indulgent, self-glorifying crap, much as one would expect from a Tarantino acolyte.Let's talk about the deleted scenes; what is their problem? - that they should never have been deleted! they're beautiful, and they add to the story, - what the hey?! Were they too linear for someone's taste? - whose? Rodriguez or Tarentino? Look, recent Japanese directors use more video and CGI than any American ever dreamed - yet they almost never talk about it! - Why not? Because they know that the moving picture is what you see on the screen, how it gets there is a matter of logistics.Please someone wake Robert Rodriguez up to his real talents! The heart of this film is the retired FBI agent, the relationship between him and the CIA agent and the American criminal on the run and the mariachi - that's the story, and what is left of it here is really very strong.Hopefully Robert Rodriguez will wise up and go down the path this story beckons; otherwise, he could end up a footnote in Tarentino's biography.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
54,brando647,Explosive Conclusion to Mariachi Series,8,1 November 2007,"One of Robert Rodriguez's first movies shot on high definition video once again proves that sequels can be just as good or better than the originals. This movie is the conclusion to Rodriguez's Mariachi trilogy, with El Mariachi being pulled into a plot to prevent the Mexican government from being overrun by a corrupt Mexican general. This movie was actually my first exposure to Rodriguez's trilogy and it hooked me immediately. The visuals are spectacular and I instantly loved the characters.For having shot this movie in such a short amount of time, it looks awesome. You're treated to beautiful shots of Mexican landscape and architecture, right before it gets shot up in some great gun battles. In some of these scenes, you'd never think that a most (if not all) of the bullets and architecture damage were added digitally, although it makes bullet-hole continuity a pain (if you pay attention to that sort of thing). This movie shows that Rodriguez has a serious gift for putting together great action scenes (see Mariachi and Carolina's escape from the hotel).The cast in this movie rocked. This movie continues to show why Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors. His role as Agent Sands, the corrupt CIA agent, was definitely one of the best parts of this movie, adding most of the humor (and in the final 20 minutes, he makes for one of the coolest looking movie characters I've seen in a long time). Of course, Sands wasn't the only character in the movie. Antonio Banderas continues to rule as El, and Willem Dafoe (another favorite actor of mine) rounds out the key players as the ruler of the local drug cartel. You know an actor's good when he can believably pull off playing another race. If I hadn't seen Dafoe in others movie previously, I could believe he was Mexican (which is amazing seeing as how the man doesn't speak Spanish). We also get superb performances from supporting players Eva Mendes, Rueben Blades, Mickey Rourke, Danny Trejo, and Enrique Iglesias.I can honestly say that Rodriguez's final Mariachi installment is one of my favorite action movies. It was enough to hook me on a trilogy I had seen nothing of previously and had no background before watching. A fast-paced action flick with a great story (and equally good soundtrack). Plus, if you have the DVD, make sure you check out the special features to see just how passionate Rodriguez is about his craft.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
55,oneguyrambling,A blur of too many ideas and an overflow of characters. Fun but confusing.,6,27 November 2010,"The director Robert Rodriguez made some notably cool films, including Desperado and From Dusk till Dawn, and Planet Terror which was inadvertently dragged down by the overwhelming suckiness of the sister movie Death Proof.With Once upon a time in Mexico I think Rodriguez wanted to make the kick-ass over the top mind blowing finale to his Antonio Banderas as an angry gun-toting Mexican trilogy, but there is so much going on in this dog's breakfast of a film that it simply ends up overwhelming itself and losing its way.But what the hell is all this about? The president of Mexico is to be assassinated, because he is a good guy and that gives hard working drug barons the shits. Everyone and his dog in this movie is involved in some way, either on the trying to kill him side or the trying to find out and stop the bad guys side, many of them are working two sides or waiting to see who will win and what they can get out of the scraps.The only one in the entire film who is pure is Antonio, Awwwwwww.Banderas, the 40-something-woman's heartthrob, is back as the unnamed ""Desperado"", referred to in hushed tones by various characters in the film and given almost legendary status. He returns alongside his muse played by Salma Hayek, who in unthinkably bad form is only in the film for a few minutes in flashback. (I think I heard she didn't want to even be in the film and agreed to a bit role more as a favour to the director who basically gave her a US career, but she is at the peak of her hotness here and minimizing her role is inexcusable.) Antonio spends most of the film doing one of two things:1. Reminiscing about times spent with Salma, (fair enough too, scroll back up!)2. Trying to avenge Salma.As we can guess Salma is no longer, she gets less than 10 minutes screen time and perhaps 5 lines of dialogue. Then again this isn't her film nor Antonio's either. Instead amid the hodge-podge ""Who's Who"" of Latin actors on show including Eva Mendes, Ruben Blades, Danny ""Machete"" Trejo, Salma, Antonio and even an Iglesias, it is pasty ol' Johnny Depp that makes OUATIM his own.Depp plays Agent Sands of the CIA in a role even more cartoony than his Jack Sparrow in the various Pirates films. He spends half the film in various awful outfits that uncaring vacationers might wear and the whole film overacting to the point that I kept expecting him to turn and wink into the camera.Robert Rodriguez makes a big point at the start of his films that he is responsible for almost everything that goes into it, including writing, editing and directing. OUATIM is one example that perhaps this isn't always a great thing. There is so much going on and so many people doing the goings on that every character is under-utilised, a more judicious script supervisor and some simple editing might have saved this film from at times disappearing up it's own arse.In saying that there are some truly cool scenes and some ""mad stupid"" stuntaleros, there are also some quotable quotes ""Are you a Mexi-CAN, or a Mexi-CAN'T?"", but too often the truly cool is diluted by the omni-presence of the uncool and try hard.(Oh and Mickey Rourke is in it carrying a Chihuahua around, don't know why that is important but I felt like I was missing something by omitting this fact.) Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. Desperado was OTT excellence, From Dusk Till Dawn was genre hopping excellence. With OUATIM Rodriguez finally over-reaches, and the end result is an uneven and frustrating film.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

With that being said, I was looking forward to seeing the final movie of his Mariachi trilogy, Once Upon A Time In Mexico, starring again, Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek.

Well, this does go wrong in several ways, and when I say several ways, I mean that literally, as along with Banderas and Depp, There's appearances by Willem Defoe, Mickey Roarke, Enrique Iglesias, Ruben Blades etc. And we're just not talking cameo appearances, they have actual plot lines. So there's all these little stories happening, with the main plot line (Banderas?? Helllooooo?) being drowned out. As for Hayek, forget it, I feel cheated!

Hey I warned you!!!
If you loved El Mariachi and Desperado, do not watch this film.  You won't like them as much after watching this dumb sequel.  This movie is caught up in useless dialogue, and is utterly boring for the first 70 minutes of the film.  The last half hour shows some of it's possible glory, but it's too late.  El Mariachi is about revenge, Desperado is about revenge and love.OUATIM isn't much about anything. Everybody is seeking revenge so the Mariachi doesn't seem so legendary anymore.  It's like they stuck the character in the middle of a soap opera.  Speaking of which, I've left soaps because characters started doing things that didn't fit the character they were playing.  Why did Salma Hayek even bother to star in this film?  She wasn't a huge action star in Desperado, but in Once they made her to be as good or better than our Mariachi in bloodless coy.  I think Robert Rodrigez confused her role in  From Dusk till Dawn with Desperado.The trailer is also useless.  Making Carolina seem to be more of an important role.  Why kill her and the daughter off.  They have no sense of time in the movie.And the trailer really doesn't show that the main character in this film is really Johnny Depp.  Who is hilarious without his eyes.  Seems to take it in stride.I didn't think the sequel to Tomb Raider could be beaten in dumbness. 
But frankly this movie is really a waste of my time and I came off hating the film more than I wanted to.3/10Quality: 6/10 Entertainment: 6/10 Replayable: 2/10",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
58,mstomaso,The Sons of Mexico Work it Out,8,16 September 2007,"The excellent Robert Rodrigues returned to the legend of El Mariachi to give us this third installment in the great series. Like most of Rodrigues' films, Once Upon a Time is as much a comedy as it is a wide-open action film. Antonio Banderas is back as El Mariachi, and Selma Hayek shows up in a series of flashbacks. The supporting cast is an all-star list of sorts: Johnny Depp gives a great supporting performance as a slightly psychotic and highly corrupt CIA agent with a personal agenda. Ruben Blades balances him out perfectly as a disgruntled ex-FBI agent. Willem DaFoe plays the heavy and is utterly despicable. Mickey Rourke makes a great down-and-out American criminal fugitive. Danny Trejo is, as always, great. And Cheech Marin makes a nice long cameo. Eva Mendes and Enrique Iglesias can't quite compete with this crowd, but they are fine for the roles they fill. The plot is a fairly complex spaghetti western pulp mixed with a substantial amount of post-colonial indigenism and, of course, ridiculous, over-the-top action. Although the humor is sustained throughout the film, most of the laugh-out-loud moments occur in the first half hour or so. El Mariachi, depressed over the murder of his wife and child, has retired to a small town where he crafts guitars and spends time with people he likes. But a sociopath CIA agent wants to recruit him in order to pull a double-play against both the beneficent president of Mexico and the General the drug cartels have hired to assassinate him. This general just so happens to be the same mane responsible for the destruction of El Mariachi's family. Our hero must decide what to do and how. But the cartels have an ace in the hole which they are about to spring on the CIA, FBI, and the mariachis. Though this is not Rodrigues' greatest film, it is, as usual, a grade above the average Hollywood action film. Rodrigues takes entertainment and craft seriously, but doesn't make films which take themselves too seriously (unlike most big-budget action directors). His films are consistently nicely paced, edited, and shot. Recommended, but see El Mariachi (best in the series) and Desperado first!",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
59,CitizenCaine,A Mexican Western With Plot And Style,8,14 December 2003,"Stylish sequel to Rodriguez' Desperado and El Mariachi with spaghetti western overtones. The plot unfolds in snail-like fashion with multiple flashbacks, sneering Sergio Leone style close-ups, action/chase scenes galore, and smart ass dialog delivered by a host of name actors in small roles. I have never seen the other two movies in this series, nor any movie by Robert Rodriguez, but now I'm curious. Salma Hayek is seen only in flashback, but Antonio Banderas is just right as the Mexican ""man with no name."" Johnny Depp adds an odd ball flavor to his CIA agent part Sands, much the same way he did with his role in Pirates Of The Caribbean. He also has the lion's share of the smart ass dialog. Mickey Rourke chews the scenery as Billy, a shady go-between. Eva Mendes is hot and sexy as Ajedrez, a government agent. Enrique Iglesias adds little as one of Banderas' accomplices. Danny Trejo had a different role in Desperado and appears in here as Cucuy. Cheech Marin, Ruben Blades, and Willem Dafoe also have appearances as minor characters necessary to the intricate plot. There are many outstanding action scenes, such as the balcony scene with Banderas and Hayek and the church scene where Banderas is cornered. There are double crosses, shootouts(some ridiculous), multiple revenge scenarios, heroes posing for the camera, and enough action for more than one movie here. This is a film of style and individual scenes, and so those of you that like spaghetti westerns or offbeat contemporary odes to them, will like this. Others may be put off by the convoluted unwinding of the plot, extreme violence, and shootouts(some downright absurd). However, it's all part of what makes these kind of western movies fun. *** of 4 stars.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
60,KnightsofNi11,A big explosive entertaining mess,6,7 September 2012,"Robert Rodriguez brings out the big guns, literally, for the final installment of his El Mariachi trilogy, Once Upon a Time in Mexico. This last chapter gets El Mariachi, once again played by Antonio Banderas, involved in international espionage as a CIA agent tries to bring down a powerful drug cartel leader in Mexico who is working with a corrupt general. El Mariachi is hired as a hit-man by this psychotic agent and once again finds himself involved in lots of gunfire and explosions, narrowly avoiding death at every turn.Once Upon a Time in Mexico is Rodriguez's most explosive and action packed installment of the trilogy, but it is at the expense of a well rounded story with good dialogue. The plot is pretty straightforward and easy to follow most of the time, but it's very disjointed and all over the place. I think Rodriguez threw too many characters into this film and it made the core of the story spiral out of control. It's an example of too much ambition without enough structure. So many characters, so little time. Maybe if this had been an hour longer it could have worked out better, or maybe it would have been a miserably grueling three hour experience. I think there's something that could have been done to make this film really good, but whatever it was Rodriguez didn't realize it.All that being said, Once Upon a Time in Mexico is still an incredibly exciting and explosively entertaining film. It doesn't capture the same glamorous style as Desperado, but Rodriguez still touches it up with his unique flare. Plus, this film is so chock full of big stars that to see them all work together is a lot of fun. Johnny Depp as the lunatic CIA agent is awesome, especially when he goes gun slinging crazy towards the end of the film. Mickey Rourke and Willem Dafoe have small roles as villains, and they are both fiendishly fantastic. And then you have the great bit parts from people like Cheech Marin, Ruben Blades, and, one of my favorite character actors, Danny Trejo.With such an all star cast and a visionary behind the camera it's a shame that Once Upon a Time in Mexico is a little lackluster. But it's a fun experience despite being full of problems. If you have seen El Mariachi and Desperado then certainly don't miss out on the final film of the trilogy, even if it is the weakest.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
61,stamper,Gunslingin' guitar-player cycle (sorry again about the week thing): He IS FINISHED!,5,7 March 2004,"The thing with exaggerated films is, that they can be fun, but that they needn't be. Once Upon a time in Mexico (unlike it's two predecessors) falls into the last category. Once I thought Rodriguez was an amazing director, that was until 1998 when The Faculty as released. That film was not bad, but it just wasn't great like From Dusk till Dawn or Desperado. Then Rodriguez hit rock-bottom with Spy Kids (I avoided part 2 and 3 since I hated the first one). Finally I thought when I heard of this film that he'd return to what had made him great: exaggerated, yet funny and cool film-making with good casting and stylish cinematography. Well, what can I say, at least the cast had potential. The credits in the beginning say it all. This is Robert Rodriguez FLICK, shot, CHOPPED, scored, written AND directed by Rodriguez himself. Maybe it was all a bit too much for him? I do not know, but I certainly got the impression that this was just a flick and that it was not edited but chopped. Sometimes the action sequences were just too messy to say that they were edited. As for the FLICK thing. Well this certainly is nothing more than an ordinary action flick. I mean, there is nothing of Rodriguez trademark coolness nor any sign of a sense of comedy as there were in his previous adult action films.
As far as the action is concerned, WHAT A MESS. I guess it is true, that the less you enjoy a movie the more you get irritated by the small things. First of all there are a lot of explosions on stairs or balcony's but few seem to collapse (what's that architects name???). Secondly, when some bad guys' are shot, no blood is squirting around, but there are sparks, which makes it look like they were shot with freakin' lasers from Star Wars or something. Some of the weapons annoyed me, as did the last scene with Johnny Depp. While I'm mentioning him, I might as well say, that he was (again) the best one in a film he starred in.
In conclusion I'd have to say that Once Upon a Time to Mexico is not a tribute to spaghetti western, but more of a cheap action film that is pretty shallow. Sure there are some hot chick's in it, but there is nothing new here that wasn't already in El Mariachi or Desperado. No new chemistry, no new ideas, just a bigger budget and old ideas. This film is a fine example of how one can over-do a film.

63,Ben_Cheshire,"Unoriginal and bloodthirsy in an empty, Kill Bill-esque way, but it does have Johnny Depp...",6,6 March 2004,"A spaghetti western which has the advent of being set in mexico and involving mexican actors (and filmmakers).Robert Rodriguez may be more talented than pal Tarantino, being in addition to directing and writing he physically operates the camera and shoots the movie, holds the scissors in his hand and edits the movie, and holds the guitar in his hand and writes the music. Considering both their recent efforts, Rodriguez has just scooched ahead of Tarantino on the dialogue front (which is not hard, if you've seen Kill Bill). But i must warn that how exciting you find Rodriguez's latest movie, sequal to the fantastic fun Desperado and along with predecessor El Mariarchi, forms yet another trilogy, will depend on how many others like it you've seen. If you've seen many style-over-substance bodycounters, especially fine ones like Leone's The Good the Bad and the Ugly, you may be extraordinarily underwhelmed. On the down side, you've got an appalling deficit of Sexy Selma Hayek, who, for once, actually fits the criterea of her character, who is described as ""the most beautiful woman you've ever seen."" But to cheer you up, you've got Johnny Depp, in Ed Wood - Pirates mode, giving this material the larger-than-life fun it deserves, and generally making you feel the movie is much more original than it is. Like any movie he's in, he lifts the material, and because of him i recommend it to you.

64,EijnarAmadeus,Not a worthy Once Upon a time..,5,28 April 2004,"Robert Rodriguez made DESPERADO, and that is one of the coolest and most shooting showdown movies made. Rodriguez being a good friend of master-director Tarantino decided years later to make a sequel called such a decent name as ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO. The thing with DESPERADO was the fact that it was so slick, hot, Mexican, rough and wild that it captured you straight away, well this one doesn't...and this time Rodriguez packed it full of stars, too many really! For Bumpy's sake what does Enrique Iglesias in there??Johnny Depp steals a lot of the show as the fine character Agent Sands, although neither he does a very good performance. Banderas playing the classic El Mariachi dissapears in the shadow of Depp, why Hayek has her face on the poster I don't understand despite that she's only in Banderas's dreams, and there's not too many of those. Williem Dafoe is the villain and Mickey Rourke soaps around like a stupid idiot...the movie takes it self too serious. Although there is still a lot of Rodriguez flicks and irony in there, but it doesn't make any sense when there's scenes in this movie that's so freaking bad that you can't believe it! The whole Depp thing is pretty fine, with the finale with him wearing glasses and blood from his eyes, but everything around it doesn't work. And the fact that Depp has the worst scene in the entire movie as when Depp walks into the cook and kills him...that scene is really terrible!ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO falls between two huge rocks, on one rock sits the 1 and 2stars and on the other sits Rodriguez when he was 23 years old. There is things in this movie that does work but there's way too much that doesn't. The action sequences (there's many of them!) is also very on-and-off, some scenes works brutally nice and some doesn't at all! The best scene in the movie is when Banderas escapes on a motorbike with bad-guys after him, and he does different flicks and they jump threw cactus, and the entire scene works very well actually, same with the the church - scene where Banderas goes bananas after he's been confessing. Iglesias makes a fool out of himself, not too surprising but it's the fact. The Mexico look works pretty good and the movie's mood is pretty fine, but as said earlier; some stuff works, others don't. And the parts that don't, are so important to a movie that it ruins the whole thing.Banderas dissapears, Hayek is there for some scenes, Depp is pretty fine, Rourke is stupid, Dafoe is dum and Iglesias is terrible.

65,grahamsj3,Ludicrous,5,7 July 2006,"I think the writers and director of this film have watched too many kung fu movies. The stunts in this film are just as ridiculous as they are in the martial arts films. The acting isn't even very good, considering the cast. Banderas isn't a great actor anyway, relying mostly on his looks to get him by. But I expected more of Johnny Depp. Salma Hayek is billed as being a big character, but she plays only a minor role. I'm really trying to think of this film's strength or strengths and, you know, I can't come up with any. The story's OK, but the rest of the film's execution is just too ridiculous to be taken seriously. I'm really glad I didn't pay good money to see this waste of celluloid.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

That was the Mexico I first saw on my family's little Sylvania TV, acquired in the very early Fifties.  Broad sombreros and bloodless gunfights and some good humor.  A long cry from this film that can't be described as being truly anemic since the blood runs like tequila.Needless gore, senseless violence, unrestrained psychopathy-and those are the movie's more dynamic qualities.  The story makes little sense, the characters aren't developed as much as they are macerated in a nonstop orgy of techno-killing.  Banderas as the ""hero"" has virtually no dialogue and Salma Hayek appears very briefly as a silent, shimmering beauty.  Perhaps to avoid being accused of stereotyping Mexicans, director Rodriguez paints gringos and natives alike as shallow headcases who kill for fun as well as for money and politics.True Mexican cuisine, rarely available in most of the United States, is dealt a horrific and gratuitous insult that adds nothing to the story.  I won't be able to face a paella for a week.If you enjoy nonstop homicide sprinkled with a crescendo of fiendishness set in a beautiful setting, this is your film.  3/10.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

You have Banderas in the lead role again but also have another great actor in a main role with Johnny Depp as Agent Sands to play counter point to him. I was at first bummed out that Salma Hayek's role was fairly small but from a storyline purpose keeping it the way it was is a good way to create motivation for the Mariachi to come out of retirement and to seek retribution. You also have a great supporting cast with Mickey Rourke, Eva Mendes, Willem Dafoe, Cheech Marin, Ruben Blades and Danny Trejo.

68,Antagonisten,Most of all it's sad.,3,4 May 2005,"When i first saw ""Desperado"" back when it came out, the thing that stayed with me was how stylish the movie was. The tasteful use of slow-motion, the camera angles, the music and the whole style of the movie, it all spoke of a unique sense when it came to movie-making. Sure movies like it had been done before, not least in Asia where the almost over-worked stylish brand of movies had gone on longer. But ""Desperado"" was still special. Which is why ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"" is such a disappointment.The thing is that ""Desperado"" was not a masterpiece. However it was a movie that managed to avoid putting the focus on it's weaknesses by having clear strengths. The visuals, the action-scenes, the photography and other things made you forget that the script was a story done a thousand times before in one version or another. Here there are just not enough forgiving aspects. That said there are upsides to this movie, even though they are few.First of all Johnny Depp is as always well worth watching. Here he also delivers most of the comic relief in the movie. His CIA-agent with his thousand-and-one disguises offers a few laughs, and Depp is a class actor. Also Robert Rodriguez has not forgotten everything about how to make a good action movie. Even though the action scenes are lacking compared to ""Desperado"" they are still not that bad.So are these two positive remarks enough to save this movie? Not by a long shot. I was extremely disappointed when seeing this movie. Not only because of the way that Robert Rodriguez has fallen, but also because this would be a crap movie from any director. Most of all it's sad.I rate this 3/10.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

It was very bloody, but with its tricked-out guitar cases and inventive dark humor, the violence was still clever.  Johnny Depp gives a wonderful, twisted performance as Sands, the CIA agent.

Not that the second complaint wasn't partially expected, after all Desparado wasn't very well known for it's stunning portrayal of the idiosyncracies of human behavior, but.....the stunts were quite good and as usual it didn't make much sense (continuity wise) as a sequel but oh well.

Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek are the leading actors in this film and they are stunning. Johnny Depp is awesome and has great scenes. One of the problems I had with this movie is that all scenes seemed mixed up to me, in one scene you have two characters talking over what's going to happen and what they will do, the next scene both characters don't seem to know each other. for example the characters of Banderas and Depp talk to each other in one scene but then there is no more interaction between them.

Then there was ""Desperado"", an even more over-the-top, higher-budget, fun film. Now, there's ""Once Upon a Time In Mexico"", a ridiculously over-the-top, high-budget fun film.The plot here is very knotted and confusing, but still very good. As far as I can figure, it is about a man who has ruined El Mariachi's life, General Marquez, and his plan to kill the president. An FBI Agent is out to stop him, so he hires El Mariachi and various other people.Now for the cast: all were excellent.Antonio Banderas made a thrilling return as El Mariachi. Salma Hayek also makes a fun return as Carolina. Johnnny Depp plays a funny, interesting, and colorful Agent Sands, the FBI agent who hires El Mariachi. Danny Trejo was great as Cucuy, Sands' tail on El Mariachi. Cheech Marin was fitting for the part of Belini, the informant who gives Sands his intel. Ruben Blades was EXCELLENT as Jorge Ramirez, the retired FBI agent brought back to the force by Sands (unofficially anyway). El Mariachi's friends, Lorenzo (Enrique Iglesias), and Fideo (Marco Leonardi) were interesting. Eva Mendes was even not-terrible as the agent Ajedrez. Pedro Armendáriz Jr. gave a decent performance as the president. And Julio Oscar Mechoso was good as the president's adviser.Now for the bad guys: Willem Dafoe gives a very evil performance as Barillo, who hired Marquez to kill the president. Mickey Rourke was extraordinary as Billy Chambers, Barillo's right-hand man. Gerardo Vigil was great as General Marquez as well. The special effects here were 1st rate and came in handy a lot. There were many good action scenes and the comedy was well placed and funny. The music score was decent also.Over all, fans of ""El Mariachi"" and ""Desperado"" will enjoy ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico""8/10",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
73,supertom-3,"Adrenaline pumping, exuberant, imaginative, fun!!!",8,28 September 2003,"The third in the El Mariachi trilogy is arguably the best. It is hard to say really. They are all fun, superbly shot and edited and insanely over the top. Okay so the first was more restrained, in terms of budget and direction, but it had a low budget charm to it and the best story. Desperado was wild, full blown excitement with great soundtrack from Los Lobos, who I don't believe appear in the soundtrack this time.Anyway this film is superbly shot. It gives reference to westerns, old black and white movies from the like of Orson Welles, and even silent movies in the way the camera captures its participants. This is all put together with Rodriguez's own inimitable style and energy. They way he shoots and edits his movies, when un-restrained especially, is superb, it really seem organic, as if he knows entirely how he will cut it together as he films it. Aside from the imaginative way this is shot, the cinematography is lush and crisp, it was shot on digital film and it looks fantastic, it will surely be a far more common place thing to do in the near future, the only other movies I can think of who did that were Star Wars Episode 2  and the similarly gorgeously shot Brotherhood of the Wolf.This is all about having fun, without any studio angles, such as aiming to the certain teen demographics, such as those who are into the hip hop culture (Cradle 2 the Grave) or those Nu Metal extreme sport nuts (XXX). This is knowingly dumb, and was obviously a hoot to film. It is introduced as `a Robert Rodriguez Flick' so the makers know they are not making Shakespeare.  This is the best of dumb fun movies, you don't feel you have fallen for targeted ad campaigns, your just there to have fun with no strings attached because Rodriguez and the cast had a great time making it. As with many movies of this type there is little story, but at the same time Rodriguez gives some character to the Mariachi, played well by Antonio Banderas.The cast are all good, they were all sensing the vibe of fun and joined in. Rodriguez is a great director in that respect, he has such an appreciation of film, and other artists, and his films are sp personal and against the Hollywood system that big name actors want to work with him. He has never done a film over 40 million, and how else do you explain his ability to have people like Johnny Depp, Willem Defoe, Harvey Keitel, Stallone, and many more big names starring in essentially low budget movies, that are about simplistic, genuinely fun entertainment rather than Oscar worthy scripting. Don't get me wrong I would love to see Rodriguez doing a really good film, rather than a good movie going experience. Anyway, once again Depp is on fire, as he was in Pirates of the Caribbean. To completely contrasting roles that underline in a year the diversity of his acting choices. Depp steals the show again, and if this guy finishes his career without an Oscar nomination then I will be truly appalled at the way in which the academy chooses their nominations, in a slow year however, in terms of Academy favoured movies, Depp is tipped as a possible nominee for Pirates. I feel he deserves it for that, because he steals the movie, and is praised by every person, critic or average Joe, who has seen it. It isn't the normal Oscar fodder type movie, but there have been few this year. Antonio Banderas makes up for the travesty that was Ecks VS Sever, in which he was looking a little old and out of shape, and which was truly bad. Here however he looks no different to the way he did ten years ago in Desperado, and he has that total bad ass presence he had then. The rest of the cast are good and have fun, but once again it is Depp that takes the honours.Overall this is an enjoyable romp, it is fast and frantic, the action is imaginative and just completely nuts. Also Rodriguez's score is superb, this guy is the definition of multi-talented. ***1/2",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
74,christian123,Fun But Sometimes Too Cheesy And Idiotic,6,12 July 2005,"Once Upon a Time in Mexico is sometimes enjoyable to watch but it gets a little cheesy and idiotic. Haunted and scarred by tragedy, El Mariachi has retreated into a life of isolation. He is forced out of hiding when Sands, a corrupt CIA agent, recruits the reclusive hero to sabotage an assassination plot against the president of Mexico, which has been conceived by the evil cartel kingpin, Barillo. But El Mariachi also has his own reasons for returning--blood revenge. The desperado returns with his two capable cohorts Lorenzo and Fideo. And the legend of El Mariachi reaches new heights of adventure. The first two were good but I felt that this sequel wasn't really needed. This film is pretty much plot less as it was just a bunch of different action sequences. The story was weak and it seemed like this film was only run by star power and gory action scenes. It works a little for this film since the actors on screen actually do a good enough job. Not all the actors are strong though but most of the important characters are. Antonio Banderas did a pretty good job which is surprising since I don't really like him. Salma Hayek was pretty good eye candy but gave only a mediocre performance. Johnny Depp gives a really good and funny performance. He probably did the best and he was really entertaining to watch on screen. Eva Mendes isn't in the movie very much and even though she usually is pretty good, I couldn't stand her this time. There are also a lot of other smaller roles played by talented actors like Danny Trejo and Willem Dafoe. Robert Rodriguez does a good job of directing really gory action but pretty much leaves out everything else such as character development. The action is done well and its pretty entertaining to watch. The film is very gory well not over the top gory but it sometimes becomes unnecessary. The movie is cheesy as the story is kind of dumb and so is the dialog. The film doesn't really get dull though as the 100 minutes running time feels short. This isn't really a film worth watching but its somewhat of a fun experience. In the end, this may be worth checking out on video as long as you don't want a good story but just gory action.

75,Okonh0wp,*** 1/2 out fo 4 stars,9,11 October 2003,"Once Upon a Time in Mexico, ('92 to be exact), a cinematic visionary named Robert Rodriguez made a pretty decent movie with only $7,000. The film, about a guitar playing hero taking up a life of crime after his guitar-playing hand is shot, got him enough attention in Hollywood to attract a bigger budget. Catching the end of this trilogy, it appears he used the cash to find more convincing ways of blowing people up. To call the movie violent is an understatement and there are a couple of moments so graphic that I recommend squeamish people stay away. However, the violence is first-rate here, and Rodriguez' gift of lightly sprinkling clever touches into his action shines through. Set against a masterfully crafted backdrop and a somber Latin-flavored score, Mexico is a shift from his earlier movies in its more epic tone. With a couple exceptions, there is very little character development and in its place is a complex story featuring a complex web of characters on various sides of the good/evil divide. Whether you're able to follow the plot, you'll probably be highly engaged by it and, in contrast to Mexico's tragic predecessors, be elated when the good guys win in the end.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

This time El, suffering personal tragedy of his own, is recruited by CIA Agent Sands (Johnny Depp) to take down a gang leader attempting to corrupt the Mexican president. The strangest element of this one is that El actually has surprisingly little screen time and the least fleshed out storyline in favour of the political subplot. I did find this a bit disappointing upon first watch but it still holds impressive action sequences and certain imagery such as Sand's standoff toward the end and Mariachi's showdown in a church that is brilliant stuff! Depp is probably given the most time on screen which is fantastic as he is mesmerising and Sands is a pretty funny character with a dark edge. We also have another standout performance from Mickey Rourke as Billy; a man who is ready to retire and enjoys the simpler things in life but finds himself still hanging around the bad guys. It's a shame that with the bigger budget and scope in this conclusion, there's only really a few memorable sequences. But wow... those are awesome sequences!

I thought it was too lacking in coherent story and too mindlessly violent.  The violence was portrayed as matter of fact with little emotional consequence.  An old man is brutally killed in cold blood in the beginning of the movie and no one seems to notice or express any sadness or remorse at his murder.  I guess that it the thing, the lack of remorse or emotion to the killings.  Johnny Depp is aided by a small boy who shows scant reaction to the brutal slayings that happen right in front of him.  Are we as a society as numb to the violence?  Is that why young people are slaughtered everyday in gun violence.  The principal players are shown to be shot full of holes then reappear with no apparent injury.  I understand the injuries happened in the past but you can't get shot and not suffer some reduction in vitality.  Maybe I am looking too close at a movie that is meant to be taken as cartoonish.  The acting was negligible.  Johnny Depp mugged for the camera.  Antonio Banderas brooded.  Salma Hayek and Eva Mendas posed.   Mickey Rourke and Willem Dafoe oozed.   Cheech Marin was okay.  It was not my type of movie.  It you like mindless violence where things blow up real good it probably isn't a bad choice.  I found it disturbing.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

After ""Desparado"" I had certain faith on Rodriguez but hell, I got tired in the end by endless rounds of gunshot and superhuman actions by Sands and El Mariarchi. The plot was a mess from the beginning and inclusion of too many important characters made that worsen. And can you believe it? Salma Hayek's name appear second in the cast list for being in a few flashbacks: a total of less than 20 minutes screen time! And for the flashbacks too, they were quite unnecessary and disturbing.If one is a fan of such die-hard action, it may not be a bad experience altogether, with occasional good fret-play by Mr. Banderas besides being our gunslinging hero. Enrique Iglesias's film debut is perhaps a nightmare for him as he looked rather scared of acting all the time. Eva Mendes should have got more screen time.

80,ssvikas,Mindless movie... Hightly Avoidable,2,12 May 2005,"Summary: Actually, I couldn't make out any sensible story line. All I could see was El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas), his wife Carolina (Salma Hayek) and Sands (Johnny Depp) mindlessly shooting people with a modified guitar that has a gun embedded in it. Hey folks, now you can stop blaming that Hindi movies show a lot of bakwas.Comment: Lets get one thing straight, there is actually no story in the movie. It is all about shooting around the way one likes. In one of the scenes, Depp doesn't like the taste of pork in a hotel and shoots the cook right away. That is downright comical.If you are going to this movie to see Salma Hayek, that would be the biggest mistake you would make. She is hardly in 5 minutes of the footage and that too in Banderas' dreams. You can call it a guest appearance and nothing more than that.Depp with his long hair looks more like Micheal Jackson rather than a rough Shooter. Moreover his dialogues don't make much sense. The Director Rodrigues needs to understand that using too much of Spanish and the four letter word doesn't make the story. This is too shabby a work expected from a director of the class of Rodrigues. Probably, he didn't get third time lucky with his Mexican Overdose (after his 2 movies El Mariachi and Desperado).Lastly, if you have nothing else do and have lots of time to spare, better find a place where you can sit peacefully and eat groundnuts rather than spend 2 hours of your life on this movie. In case you are watching this movie after watching LOC, you would surely go bananas.Rating: 1/5",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
81,kurciasbezdalas,Pretty different from it's prequels,9,8 November 2008,"This movie really is different from El Mariachi and Desperado and because of that it may be disappointing for some people. First of all this time El Mariachi isn't the main character of the film, this time there are few main characters, one of them is Sands played by Johnny Depp, who in my opinion steals the show from Antonio Banderas, who's character didn't appeared so often in this film. Also not like in Desperado, this time there were less humour in this part, even Cheech Marin was serious this time. On the other hand there were some good action sequences and not like in previous films there was a car chase scene, which was pretty good.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

I did like the shoot em up action but it still lacked a little in the story.  Every scene Depp is in is great which makes it good that he is in almost every scene.Don't miss this movie though.

84,Ronin47,"Weakest of the trilogy, but still very good (***)",7,19 October 2003,"After the three ""Spy Kids"" films, it's nice to see director Robert Rodriguez getting back to making movies for adults, and ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"" is the third chapter in his pulpy series of films about El Mariachi, the guitar-playing, gun slinging Mexican hero played again (to perfection) by Antonio Banderas. The second film in the series, ""Desperado"", is a favorite of mine; a near-perfect example of quick, simple and exciting action storytelling, with the right mixture of cool style and hot emotion. ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"" is a much harder film to like than its predecessors. It's grim, murky, weird, and has a storyline that is haphazard, hard-to-follow, and not all that interesting a lot of the time. However, this is the kind of movie where that doesn't really matter. It's about moments. Cool actors. Cool camera shots. Cool music. Mexican stand-offs on dusty roads. Tragic flashbacks. Blood splattering. And above all, cool guns. Ultimately, even with its bigger size and epic feel, it's a pale shadow of ""Desperado"" and ""El Mariachi"", because those films had a more focused story. Still, if you dig Rodriguez's style, as I do, you'll find enough here to enjoy. Deserving of special praise is Johnny Depp who, like he did in the weak ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" movie, pretty much steals the show with his ironic, quirky coolness.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
85,jrfranklin01,Desperado No More,1,24 May 2004,"Oftentimes our last impression of a movie compels us (if the impression is a good one) to watch it's sequel.  In the case of Once Upon a Time in Mexico, this would be a mistake.Desperado was a movie to own.  A wonderful Mexican tale of an outlaw who blazes through the hellish gates of the drug cartel as a modern day Robin Hood.  The performances by Antonio Banderas, the lovely Salma Hayek, Cheech Marin, etc. were top notch.  And the story was simple enough to follow with superb action sequences.  All of this acclaim over Desperado I have built up to tell you now...expect none or little of this with Once Upon a Time in Mexico.  In fact, expect to almost be appalled.  Because after having watched such a good film to be left with such a bad sequel, is unfair to any audience.  It is said no sequel is equal to the original and I agree.  But the level of inequality should not be such to make you almost cringe at the comparison.  Sure Once Upon a Time seems convincing enough to watch given the return of the original star cast.  Robert Rodriguez (director) even adds Willem Dafoe, Mickey Rourke, and Johnny Depp.  But none of the helps.
Rodriguez' fundamental flaw in his sequel was in amplifying the story beyond belief to the point of almost comedic insanity.  Dafoe is a cartel boss, Rourke is his whipping boy, and Depp...well, he pretty much is a nutjob in his own right, except employed by the CIA.  Banderas returns as the enigmatic El Mariachi, but even though he plays the role well in Once Upon a Time, his character is stuck in such a pathetic story that no amount of good acting can forgive the insult to Desperado Rodriguez commits. 
The very basics of the story:  Banderas (El Mariachi)is hunt down by Depp (CIA whackjob) who enlists his serves to kill the president of Mexico.  Depp also convinces an ex-FBI agent to assassinate the cartel kingpin (Dafoe). In the midst of this is the general of the military, responsible for killing El Mariachi's wife (Hayek) and his daughter.  Ensuing is a quest for revenge....and....yeah, that's about it.  But not to be too disappointed, the film is ripe with Rodriguez' typical appetite of blood and destruction/mayhem.A friend of mine, whose advice I obviously didn't take, told me not to waste my time and disappoint myself by watching this film.  I hope you won't make the same mistake I did and not listen to good advice.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
86,extravaluejotter,El Mariachi gets The Blues,1,14 August 2006,"This film is just woefully bad. Robert Rodriguez has squandered all the talent of his cast with a ludicrous retread of ""El Mariachi"" and ""Desperado"". ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" is nothing more than a string of action sequences interspersed with credulity-straining double-crosses.If you like watching people kill each other while they make witty comments then you'll probably enjoy this film. However, you'd be better off watching ""Desperado"" which is much less silly and a far better movie.Type the word ""Pointless"" into any search engine and you'll get 100 links to ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"". That's how cruddy this film is. Just take my word for it. Watch ""Desperado"" instead. You'll thank me.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
87,Pavel-8,"A highly enjoyable experience, although the parts don't form a complete whole.",7,5 October 2003,"""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" is the third (and final?) installment in director Robert Rodriguez's guitar-toting gunman series that began with ""El Mariachi"" in 1992 and continued with ""Desperado"" in 1995. Although knowing of the prequels is an advantage, you mustn't have seen either previous movie to enjoy and understand this one, because flashbacks sum up the necessary information.The opening credits of ""Mexico"" label it as a ""Robert Rodriguez flick."" That's the best way to sum up this movie. Had everything not been the product of one man, the diversity could have easily killed this movie. But all aspects of the film (except the story) mesh seamlessly to produce a piece that is much more enjoyable than it should be.The plot can be succinctly described as convoluted. Sands (Johnny Depp) enlists the help of El Mariachi (Antonia Banderas) to prevent a coup d'etat led by General Morales, who is also Banderas' arch-enemy, having killed his wife (Salma Hayek) and child. That's the simple part, but throw in a stellar supporting cast including a drug lord (Willem Dafoe) and his bodyguard (Mickey Rourke), a former FBI agent (Ruben Blades), a thug (Danny Trejo), another government agent (Eva Mendes), and a couple other mariachis (Enrique Iglesias & Marco Leonardi), and you have enough crazy relationships to fill an episode of Melrose Place. Thus, trying to accurately follow and explain the entire plot during an initial viewing is nearly impossible. That is frustrating at times, but thankfully, ""Mexico"" is the rare flick in which following the intricacies of plot isn't crucial to enjoying the movie.
That is because ""Mexico"" is the best looking movie (not part of an epic trilogy) since 2001's ""Ocean's Eleven"". Rodriguez, who serves as director, editor, composer, cinematographer, and many other roles, paints a brash, bold, colorful world filled with brash, bold, colorful characters. Using broad brushstrokes, he sets the viewer in the midst of a nearly comic-book-style small desert town in Mexico. Each character there has an individual agenda that considers other people only as means to an end. This seems like a recipe for a disjointed film, and to some extent it is. But the individual scenes are so deliciously fun that you won't care until you try to piece things back together afterwards.Each scene works because of the superb casting and the ensuing quality performances. Every actor looks the part to a tee, and in a movie that wastes little time with exposition, that is very important. You know exactly who Antonio Banderas is after about ten seconds. His brooding demeanor and his reluctant movement tell you all you need to know. Likewise with the again impressive Johnny Deep. His words and attire quickly inform of his off-the-wall yet not-to-be-trifled-with character. Salma Hayek is stunning and deadly, but also quietly injects a necessary dollop of heart into the film. Rourke, Trejo, Dafoe, Blades, et al...they all slide effortlessly into their parts. With all the chiseled but smooth facial features present here, one doubts Rodriguez could have sculpted his actors more perfectly had he tried.But just as importantly, these actors are also talented. Nearly every role could easily be a one-note character, but the veteran cast does more than that. The parts still aren't fully fleshed out three-dimensional characters, but that isn't what is required either. In such a wild world, two dimensions are sufficient, and those are provided by nearly everyone.
The music is as blatant as the rest of the movie. Scored by Rodriguez, the strings and horns blast at appropriate times, yet manage not to be melodramatic or over the top, rather matching the film's daring attitude. The cinematography shines as well. Using a variety of crane shots, lenses, and transitions to frame beautiful people and places, Rodriguez concocts a visually kinetic film that is constantly in motion without annoying the viewer.The visual effects are also pure Rodriguez, which is both good and bad. Rated R for strong violence, ""Mexico"" earns its rating time and time again as men are blown ridiculous distances by bullets and explosions. Over the top? Yes, but somehow they almost seem possible in the portrayed world. At times though, the higher budget effects do conflict with the guerrilla filmmaking that characterizes much of the rest of the movie. More money (a $30 million budget in this case) often eliminates the need for the creativity that was omnipresent in ""El Mariachi"" ($7,000) and sometimes lacking in ""Desperado"" ($7 million).Bottom Line: Flashier than its predecessors. Less charming than the first. More complex than the second. Worth seeing for the filmmaking alone. More enjoyable than it is good.  7 of 10.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
88,rcavellero,Once upon a time in what???,5,17 September 2003,"So Robert Rodriguez has returned to his El Mariachi trilogy.  And although the first two are shining examples of creative and exploitive cinema.  Once upon a time in Mexico falls through it's own self imposed cracks.  Although, I understand the presumption and intent of this film it just doesn't work. It's obviously a throwback to the trashy spaghetti western of the past.  But there's no one flow to this film and it doesn't have much to offer in the form of continuos plot or charachter development.  The acting is mediocre except for Johnny Depp which shines in an otherwise throw away roll.  The film I'm assuming picks up some time after Desperado.  As it's guitar toting assassin flashes back to his last love.  Other than that I can not even begin to explain what this film is about.  It's so contrived on so many levels it leaves you wondering why the otherwise talented Rodriguez wasted time spewing together a film that doesn't earn it's title much less an apparent sequel in the Mariachi trilogy.  Rodriguez scored big with the cute and inventive Spy Kids flicks. The movie is loaded with gratious and unintentionally funny action sequences that become so repeative that it loses any type of cool vibe the style had going for it.  Altogether it wasn't all that bad, but extremely mediocre.  What it did have going for it was a strong and hysterically funny performance from Depp who is inching more towards super stardom as this film will undoubtedly hit no. 1 because of the undeserved buzz. Ultimatly it leaves you wondering Once upon a time in Mexico is just Once upon a time in what???",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
89,scobbah,I feel like a living questionmark,4,26 July 2004,"As always, Johnny Depp is in the movie and then I just think: damn it has to be good! Too bad this movie is my very first disappointment. The story develops in a strange way and is, time to time, a little bit weird. It's difficult to keep up with the characters as you ain't about to get to know any of'em that well, and I feel that even though I've seen 'Desperado' and was quite familiar with the basic story itself. Banderas acting here is poor compared to 'Desperado', and only God know why they've chosen to put Enrique Iglesias in a movie (and a movie like this, doh!). Depp is acting OK, but not the way as I'm used to see him do. I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone, go a head and see 'Desperado' instead (and if you have seen it before - rewind and play it again!). I'll give it a 4 out of 10 only because Depp was in it, combined with nice visual and audio effects (despite those poor scenes where everything is more predictable than anything else, makes it feel like a poor comedy!).",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
90,paulijcalderon,A great entertaining adventure,8,17 July 2016,"An action adventure blast featuring some really funny moments and characters. This is by no means a film meant to be taken seriously. Watching the trilogy in chronological order is very fun because you go from something so independent and low-budget to this over the top fast paced ""Rodriguez""- flick (as the opening titles suggest). It never really slows down which works in this movies favor. It's quiet interesting to see the development of the Mariachi character who started out in such a simple way now becoming an icon and hero figure.The plot to this movie is ridiculous and the villain played by Willem Dafoe's plan is to take down Mexico's President. But, because of this film's tone you don't mind the ridiculousness. You can have fun with it and just enjoy the ride. It's my favorite of the Mexico-trilogy because of how entertaining it was. There are some very beautiful shots of the cities and landscapes and the music was well scored, and you can even tell by how the camera moves how fun the filmmakers had making this.Johnny Depp's character gets the best story arc and how his story turns out by the third act was unexpected. Salma Hayek wasn't in this one that much and her character was reduced to a few flashbacks, which is a shame since her character's absence makes the Mariachi an even more tragic figure who just always seems to lose the ones he cares for. Sometimes it seems like he can dodge bullets too easily though, there should have been some more danger put into the action. The heroes in this film win too easily. But, the best action scene by far is the motorcycle chase, that was great. The quick editing and the timing is in well place in that scene.There are some semi-serious moments which are nice, but the film would have needed some better balance in some moments. The tone changes quickly sometimes which could be jarring for some and take away from the enjoyment. It took a little moment at the beginning to get what the aim was. But, once you grasp what the film is going for, then it really works.So, the action as a little lacking this time around, but everything else just never slows down that it made the film flow by in a good way. If you are gonna watch this film then try not to take it too seriously and you should preferably put it on during a rainy day.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

This time the story includes a corrupt CIA agent(Johnny Depp) and an revenge-seeking General.The movie was very entertaining, although very cheesy at times. The acting was mediocre, the writing was O.K., and the plot was a little to epic for El Mariachi. But this particular movie had a special actor that created a character that made the movie. Johnny Depp as the murderous CIA agent was brilliant. He was the coolest character I have ever seen! The scene with the fake arm, Just Brilliant! The special effects were also very impressive. It included many new and original ideas that I would have never thought of.So for once in my reviews, i'm going to recommend a movie that is pretty cheesy due to the great special effects and one particular performance.I recommend this movie.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
92,dirtychild,Different - Keep an Open Mind...,7,22 January 2005,"Once Upon a Time in Mexico (OUATIM) completes the El Mariachi trilogy (or in my opinion is a sequel to Desperado, which was sort of like an American remake of the original El Mariachi). OUATIM takes place some years after the events of Desperado. El Mariachi (reprised by Banderas), a lonely character, gets involved in a espionage plot to outs el Presidente by taking down General Marquez. It is also personal for El Mariachi (for reasons I'm not going to give away in this review) - so again - he is on a revenge mission. Johnny Depp's character, a crazy CIA agent who brings El Mariachi into the fold, also brings a retired FBI agent to help take down a drug lord Barillo (William Dafoe).As you can probably see from the plot - there is a lot of this movie that does not focus on El Mariachi. The story now is more complicated and bigger than a simple tale of revenge. And the audience does not know from the beginning what is the ""beef"" between El Mariachi and Gen Marquez - you only find bits out through flashbacks.I'm sure fans of the first two films would probably be disappointed with this due to the lack of focus on the El Mariachi. I certainly was the first time I saw this film - but on reflection (and subsequent viewings) - you need to have an open mind so you can get sucked into the plot involving Johnny Depp's character and Barillo and co. The action scenes are quite sensational - maybe not as cool as Desperado - but there is still a heavy influence from John Woo in here still.Overall - I think this movie was pretty good. I don't think it is as good as Desperado - but did you really want a third rehash of the same El Mariachi revenge movie?! Probably not - that is why the plot here is refreshing and keeps it interesting for the most part.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
93,joker-4,Too wordy for a Mariachi flick,7,22 September 2003,"Although great, great fun - Rodriguez certainly knows how to combine action and comedy quite well - the circuitous plot came across as a heavy James Bond film instead of the straight-shooting and cleverly simple type film the previous Mariachi films are. Luckily, Johnny Depp does more than plot all the various factions in the film against each other, he totally steals the show, which makes some of the confusion tolerable. And as fun and hip as the film is, the action is so quick that the viewer does not get that oh-so needed final, action-heavy shootout between El and the many bad guys. Maybe Robert was too distracted playing with his new digital toys from George Lucas!",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
94,MovieLuvaMatt,Entertaining,7,30 April 2004,"Like ""Desperado,"" the film offers nonstop action and a gargantuan body count.  Robert Rodriguez knows how to please his audience, and the movie does work for the most part.  As expected in a Rodriguez film, the action scenes are very well-choreographed and all possess a certain slickness and originality.  Johnny Depp steals the show in his supporting role, and seems to be having the most fun.  I actually looked at him as more of an action hero than Antonio Banderas.  Then again, Banderas seems to be going through the motions.  After all, he has played roles of this type many times before and is probably almost bored.  I like how most of the movie is in subtitles. As I heard in the commentary, the reason for that was because most of the cast only spoke Spanish.  But I'd rather see Mexican characters speaking in their native language, and having to read the subtitles, than them speaking in a second language that they obviously haven't mastered totally. Hollywood appears to have a fear of subtitles, and it's a stupid fear.  Now onto what I didn't like about the movie...I'm not exaggerating when I say that it has nonstop violence.  I'm not one of these people who gets bothered by excessive violence, but after a while all that action and killing can get a little dull.  You just sit there waiting for the next body to fall to the ground.  The story isn't non-existent, but I think if Rodriguez paid a little more attention to developing characters and story, his films might be even more interesting.  But altogether, I was entertained.  You don't view a film like this in the same way you view a Kubrick film.  So what you see is what you get.  My score:  7 (out of 10)",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

He finds that aid in El Mariachi (Banderas). Mariachi was attacked by a corrupt general long ago, and that general took vengeance and killed his wife (Hayek). That general is involved with the criminal, Barillio (Dafoe), whose cartel is planning to take over Mexico. Mariachi is told to find a team (his brothers, one of whom is Iglesias), while Sans recruits an FBI aide (Blades), whose partner was tortured and killed by Barillio. One thing leads to another, and you lose and gain trust in all the characters. The plot is kind of jumpy, and isn't necessarily strong, but enough to get an over 50% grade.Action: 2.5/2.5: The action here kicks ass. Some of the better scenes are in the church and a big chase in a small Mexican village. It isn't an Old West period movie like I thought it was supposed to be. It is modern, and has some sweet weapons. Nice work.Acting: 2.5/2.5: Dafoe is his normal good, Banderas is his normal good, Mendes is her normal good. Depp, just like in Pirates of the Caribbean, is phenomenal, though he has slightly less to work with then his wacky antics in Pirates. Iglesias joins the Bad Singers, Good Actors club along with Jennifer Lopez (well, she's a better actor than singer) and Will Smith (who kicks butt as an actor). Overall, brilliant acting.Entertainment: 2.5/2.5: Good action, decent plot, superb acting. If you can take some action without criticizing it, see this movie. I can see how more serious critics will hate some of the slightly over the top action, but overall, it's good.Bonuses: +.2 for the arm: Great trick by the CIA agent. He has a fake arm and uses it to look like he's having dinner while he really has a gun under the table. NICE! -.1 for this: one action scene has Hayek & Banderas chained together and their avoiding bullets. Not a single one hits them. Just doesn't make sense because they're positioned like sitting ducks.Total: 9.6/10: See this movie, you won't regret it. It is a sequel to El Mariachi and Desperado, in case you didn't know. Definitely a must see.General Rating: 4½ stars",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

Some of the action scenes were good, but a lot of the others were kind of way too over the top. There was also a lot of cheesy dialogue and wooden acting. The main bright spot was Johnny Depp's much deserved critically acclaimed performance. He did an excellent job and made the movie more watchable. Salma Hayek is barely in the movie and she would have made it much better. Eva Mendes is so hot i stopped caring that the movie is sub-par and just enjoyed her presence.

The story begins a while after Desperado a la Final Destination 1 to 2, where Johnny Depp and Cheech Marin share a scene very much the same as the one w/ Steve Buscemi and Cheech in Desperado.  But the film itself had alot more than Desperado had.  Desperado was a pure shootout movie (which is good) but it's obvious that Rob Rodriguez was aware that he had to top that by adding twists and turns as well as a phenomenal dirtbike chase scene (not the only good scene but it really stands out).  Johnny Depp, indeed, does steal the show here - the buyable sense of humor, the slick talking, coolness with some sadistic tendencies made him great to watch here.  Salma Hayek isn't in it as much as one would expect but she herself was involved with some tough action sequences.

However, if I had to pick one actor whose performance rules over others, it would be Depp's. He, as the one reviewer so aptly put, ""knocks it out of the park."" Plus, it's so cool that Robert Rodriguez was able to end the ""El Mariachi"" trilogy with a stunner as opposed to the ""Spy Kids"" trilogy which ended with a dud, as I put before.

But bear in mind, it does have some graphic violence in it.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
99,TerminalMadness,Horrible sequel...,4,22 September 2004,"After the much hyped performance of Johnny Depp in Robert Rodriguez' third foray into the territory of El Mariachi, I took it upon myself to see what the big deal was and again I was reminded that hype isn't everything. ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"", an obvious homage to the westerns of Sergio Leone in every respect would be such a good movie, were it not so utterly ridiculous and laden with sheer stupidity and nonsense.I'm just so disappointed because I'm not sure what happened to Robert Rodriguez or what he was on at the time he wrote this but this is not his usual satisfactory storytelling, a note that left me asking ""What happened?"" First there was ""El Mariachi"" a lackluster though above par effort on Rodriguez' part about a mariachi caught between a mob war, then there was ""Desperado"" which was an exciting film about a mariachi seeking revenge with his guitar case that doubled as a weapons case, and though it lacked in plot resolution, it was still a lot of fun to watch, and then there's this.I wasn't sure whether this would be described as a sequel or a prequel and if this even left off from ""Desperado"" storyline continuity, because it stars Antonio Banderas re-claiming his role as el mariachi, but other than that, I was lost. If you know what the plot to this movie is, then you're already five steps ahead of me, because I was just lost when I was watching, just completely lost.The problem (among so many) in this movie is that there are just too many sub-plots to watch. Two of Rodriguez' faults in his movies and scripts is that he has so many characters on-screen and no character set-up or resolution. Instead of focusing on the actual character of the story and his quest for vengeance there are sub-plots that are scattered every which way, characters who have their own agenda that never connect the sub plots into one, and of course there's just no focus on the actual main character because of that fact. We have El Mariachi, a man whom the authorities and criminals want in Mexico, they want him so they hire bounty hunters and they even raid his village, so why isn't he focused on?We're given his sub-plot that has nothing of interest to it, the fact that I'm referring to his plot as a sub-plot makes no sense, but still we're given these very confusing flashbacks between he and Hayek's character. Hayek barely has a role here to begin with by the way, she appears maybe about five times and that's basically it, and when she's on screen she has no dialogue and a lot of action, so the romance between the two is vapid.The first of many very confusing flashbacks makes for a lot of gaping plot holes that show Mariachi and his wife lying in bed and he awakes to discover they've been chained at the wrist, now if he's such a skilled warrior with lightning fast reflexes, how did they, or anyone manage to chain them together? But nonetheless, they're chained together, and they're chained by the wrist, so here's another question: why if able to chain them together couldn't they just have walked into their room and killed them both? But, I digress. They awake with their window wide open, but they manage to escape by swinging along a building. The chaining of the two within itself is half-assed as well because they have one chain connected to each other's wrist, no leg chains, and no attachments to keep them sluggish. Anyway we go back and forth from past to present so much that I was just confused to the point where I wasn't sure what scenes were present day and what scenes weren't, anymore because the storytelling is just so sloppy and scattered.There's also simply no room here for character development because the subplots here are rapid fire, the scenes are inter-cut and sloppy not to mention the action that distracts the dialogue. There's Depp's character, Mendes' character, Rourkes, Dafoe's, and many others not to mention the actual central character Banderas who gets very little screen time. So, there are a lot of things happening here that the story is just very hard to follow or become involved in, so the characters take large personality shifts by the climax. Depp's character is an intimidating and creepy presence throughout the film and then becomes just comedic and goofy by the end, Eva Mendes a very attractive and interesting character has no plot, and Dafoe and Rourke are brutally under-used with nothing much to do here except scowl and have their moments that are just so dull and bland.The action which is basically the primary motive for this film is cartoonish and really ridiculous that I just wasn't excited. We have Banderas' character shooting people and then they fly in the air onto something that explodes. Now I've never fired a gun or held a gun, but as far as logic and physics go, I'm pretty sure people don't fly fifty feet in the air after being shot. Banderas' character shoots people with such power they fly when shot, but when other characters go off the handle shooting, nothing happens. Perhaps it's magicRegardless by the end Rodriguez has simply no control over the characters and all the sub-plots come crashing together in a horrible sequence and El Mariachi rides off into the sunset. I just wish I'd gotten to see more of him before he did.(** out of ****)",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
100,boondocksaint20,Incredibly entertaining ending to the El Mariachi trilogy,8,18 September 2003,"Robert Rodriguez is definitely a talented film producer...having cut his teeth with his guerilla filmmaking style of assuming the role of director, writer, editor and cameraman, Rodriguez has dished out hits like Desperado, El Mariachi and From Dusk Til Dawn that have been box office hits with his famous shoe string budgets.  It is no wonder why this third installment to the El Mariachi series was inevitable.I caught this one on opening night, but waited a while to post a review, just to let the film digest for about a week.  I won't elaborate much on the plot, for many others have already done so.  What I will say is that the only negative aspect of this film is a plot that is filled to the brim with confusing elements, plot twists, double crosses...so on and so forth, that at times you will be sitting there going...okay, NOW what the hell is going on?  Sure, there is an elaborate web of plot twists in there that I'm sure do make sense when pieced together, but what is the result is almost a mess of scenes and characters thrown together.  However, it is the scenes and characters that totally make up for the lack of glue to bond the plot together...this is definitely one of those films that does not take itself seriously and asks you to do the same, and if you can shut your brain off for about 2 hours, you will be taken for one helluva ride.The characters are all larger than life and charmingly sadistic.  The acting is top notch with Antonio Banderas reprising his role as El Mariachi, the always superb Johnny Depp as the corrupt CIA agent Sands, Ruben Blades as a rogue retired FBI agent out to seek vengenance, and of course, the oddly entertaining Mickey Rourke as the drug czar's right hand man.  Of course, every good B-movie Hispanic actor makes an appearance, especially Danny Trejo (you know him as the evil Mexican in movies like From Dusk Til Dawn, Con Air, Heat...and pretty much every movie made in the last 10 years) and Cheech Marin from Cheech and Chong fame.  The actors drive the picture, give it life, mow down scores and scores of inept bad guys(and I will emphasize the word INEPT...the 'bad guys' are some of the most ridiculously stupid villains I have seen in a long time...but, thankfully they serve their purpose of being cannon fodder very well) and provide much needed coolness and comic relief.  You will be surprised at how Antonio Banderas almost play second fiddle to Johnny Depp's character, and the dozen or so other major supporting characters.  But, it works beautifully.The action scenes are in a word, spectacular.  When we are shaking our heads and scratching our forehead wondering what the hell is happening with the plot, Robert Rodriguez and Co. throw out scene after scene of delicious show stealing action...pure adrenaline, violence with no mercy, and excellent direction/editing are what steal the show in this film.  I forgave Mr. Rodriguez for the confusing plot when I left the theater because his film had entertained the hell out of me.  Sure, for most movies, dare I say even most action flicks, a lack of plot or a really bad plot really makes for a bad film, but this movie is the exception of exceptions.  It takes the oozing coolness from Desperado and ups the ante ten fold.  There are some scenes that will bring shivers to your body as you watch Antonio 'De Sexy' Banderas and Company perform acrobatic gunfights that would make even John Woo proud.  Rodriguez's style is definitely unique, and has been mimicked often...however, you can tell he made this one for the fans because as I said, the stakes are raised on every level with his marvelous directing and talent for filming breath taking action.This is a movie that you will love or hate, I can guarantee you...it is one with a lackluster plot, but an incredibly high entertainment value.  If you can overlook the complete stupidity of an entire Mexican Army and dozens upon dozens of inept mafia soldiers, then you are in for an excellent time at the movies.  If you think about it, though Desperado's plot was very simple and direct, and was one of the coolest movies ever, the movie itself really was not great, overall...we watch movies like this as guilty pleasures, and when they deliver, we go home happy.  I recommend this one to anyone who loves action, or Tarantino's Pulp Fiction type movies...an excellent, stylish movie, overall, but just make sure you check your brain at the door. 8/10 stars.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
101,filmbuff-36,"Convoluted and a step down from the previous film, but good performances save the day",7,23 September 2003,"It's not easy to be the closing story in a trilogy. Often times fans of the series vote the second movie as the best, and the third film, while still good, can often be a letdown. Just ask most movie fans about `Return of the Jedi' or `The Godfather, Part III.'`Once Upon a Time in Mexico' is another film indicative of this pattern. The third film in Robert Rodriguez's `El Mariachi' trilogy, it suffers the inevitable fate of being compared to its predecessor, an act that it can't follow.Don't get me wrong  there's much to like in this film. It's a visual treat, filled with style, humor and plenty of kinetic energy. As a stand-alone film, it is brilliant for the most part. Some good popcorn action occurs on screen, and there is an inexplicable beauty and craftsmanship that permeates through each frame.The movie opens with El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) in semi-retirement, living in a reclusive village as a guitar maker after decimating the populations of many towns filled with drug dealers and other criminals in the previous films. This all changes however, thanks to interference by a slimy but lively CIA agent named Sands (Johnny Depp) out to recruit El Mariachi. Sands wants the guitar-strumming gunman to help stop a violent coup that is about to take place, which will end with the Mexican president dead and the country in the hands of a violent crime lord named Barrillo (Willem Dafoe).Unbeknownst to El Mariachi, Agent Sands is working both sides of the street, playing the president into the hands of his would be assassins so that he can intercept the money for the hit and keep it for himself. Along the way he also manages to get former FBI agent Jorge (Ruben Blades) interested under false pretenses of breaking up Barrillo's cartel.The rest of the plot is made up of various minor characters, including a Mexican Federale General El Mariachi has a violent past with, two fellow gun carrying guitar players Lorenzo (Enrique Iglesias) and Fideo (Marco Leonardi) also recruited to stop to assassination, and remorseful gangster Billy Chambers (Mickey Rourke) whom Jorge is using to incriminate Barrillo.In terms of plot, `Once Upon a Time' is running strictly on formula. There are no real surprises for the most part, with just cliché characters going through the motions of double-crossing one another a snarling at the screen. To try to mask this, though, each of the major players are provided with some tick to make them more interesting  Barrillo plays the piano, Chambers constantly carries his pet Chihuahua, and Sands changes outfits in every scene.Acting skills, however, help elevate every performance in this film. Banderas makes El Mariachi a modern version of Clint Eastwood's `Man-with-no-name' from Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, silent, brooding and calms though always ready to strike like a rattlesnake. He is the ultimate living nightmare to every criminal, a seemingly unstoppable force of vengeance and destruction, and Banderas's performance reminds us of why the role made him a star eight years ago.Depp easily steals every scene he's in as the psychotic but strangely likeable Sands, always ready, willing and able to do the unthinkable with a smile on his face. Whether he's talking nonchalantly about killing a cook because his pork dish was too good to be true and it's his job to fix that, or by interfering with a bullfight so that a cocky matador doesn't have the odds stacked in his favor anymore just to prove a point about the necessity of rigging the game. Along with his role in `Pirates of the Caribbean,' Depp is clearly having a great summer making bad guys look good.Less realized but still interesting are Rourke and Blades, both reminding us of a time when they were both in top form, and hopefully thanks to this film, will be again. Salma Hayek is also memorable as El Mariachi's love interest Carolina. However, for all the hoopla about her role she only appears in flashbacks from a story that takes place between `Desperado' and this one.Rodriguez is clearly a skilled filmmaker when it comes to technical thrills, but `Once Upon a Time' ultimately collapses under its own weight in the story department. The shootouts are also a step down compared to the previous film in the series, though they still managed to light up the screen. Alone it might have been hailed as a minor classic, but compared to its two predecessors, it just lacks the firepower to be truly great.7 out of 10 stars. Great performances save the film, but I felt cheated in the action department.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
102,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of Once Upon a Time in Mexico,8,12 September 2003,"Can it be true? Is the action flick set in the West making a come back in the local Cineplex? It sure appears that way with Kevin Costner's Open Range rounding up nearly $50 million in tickets sales and now Robert Rodriguez returns to Mexico in the series that made him famous. Once Upon a Time in Mexico is technically the third film in what has been dubbed the El Mariachi series. Why technically? El Mariachi was the original student film made by Robert Rodriguez for only $7,000. When Sony picked up the rights to it and commissioned the new director to remake the film, Desperado ended up being more of a sequel then a remake. Rodriguez left the adult realm of filmmaking temporarily with much success helming the fruitful Spy Kids series. With Spy Kids 3-D Game Over grossing over $100 million at the box office a little over a month ago, the cult director hopes to double his success by finishing off the cult favorite series that started his career. But the question is whether he can transition back from the family genre to the more mature action fare? Judging by the trailers and television ads, he seems to have no problems but looks can often be deceiving.The story of Once Upon a Time in Mexico once again follows the adventures of the guitar wielding El Mariachi as he seeks retribution and revenge. El Mariachi has become a huge legend in Mexico but there is more truth behind the stories then most would expect. So true are these stories of mass killings by the guitar playing assassin that many of the cartels in Mexico have placed a huge price on his head and forced El to retire in isolation. But the price on his head is not the reason for his retirement rather it is the death of his wife and daughter at the hands of his archenemy that has brought about server depression. When a corrupt CIA agent named Sands drives him from his small village, El is recruited to take out an evil cartel called Barillo, who plans to take control of Mexico after he assassinates the president. Why is The Mariachi so willing to step forward to help him? The general who is leading the charge for Barillo killed his wife and children. Mariachi is back and is seeking blood and revenge for payback. The story for Once Upon a Time in Mexico is pretty decent but the pacing is not very consistent. The feature starts off very decently and the action sequences are well choreographed but for a longer then necessary period of time in the middle Mexico feels dragged on and lacks the punch the action fare delivers.The cast for the third film in the El Mariachi series is a mixed bag delivering both the good and the bad. Starting off with the good and possibly the best would be Johnny Depp who gives another fabulous performance following his exuberant role as Captain Jack Sparrow in the summer hit, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Taking on the role of the corrupt CIA agent Sands, Johnny Depp shows he can deliver charming dark humor along with a wonderful action performance which proves he can strike lightening twice in a few months. Antonio Banderas is excellent as El Mariachi once again and quite possibly better then he was in Desperado. The close friendship between Banderas and Rodriguez shows that the actor really knows what the director wants in a lead performance and doesn't think twice about doing certain things within the feature. Salma Hayek, as beautiful and gifted as this actress is, was over hyped in promotion for this film. Without giving too much away about her character, she isn't featured that much in the film and when she is it is in flashbacks and those scenes don't have her speaking much. The decent thing to do would have had her have more important lines if not then why not just use clips of her from Desperado instead of having her featured so minimally? Willem Dafoe was pretty good as the evil cartel Barillo but it was very hard seeing him as a Mexican considering that he isn't. Not to say he isn't a good actor but there wasn't as wonderful as decent a Latino actor available?Overall, Once Upon a Time in Mexico is an explosive and well choreographed gun assault that only falters to reload every once in awhile. Robert Rodriguez has to be greatly respected for the work he does especially when he tries so hard to keep the budgets down for his films but does the budget cutting hurt the overall effect? The cinematography is astounding except for several scenes including a scene where Johnny Depp's character shoots a man in the head in a restaurant. Those scenes looked like they were filmed on a handheld camcorder and felt insulting to the audience that paid decent money for the feature. And there was a lot more blood, gore and unnecessary violence then most people can tolerate in a normal action film but doesn't beat out Bad Boys II for the `Action Gore Award' this year though. Despite some picking at the campy directing style of Robert Rodriguez and the overloaded action sequences, Once Upon a Time in Mexico is a decent action effort that kicks Dickie Robert's butt across several movie theaters and beyond. If more films follow in Mexico's footsteps then the Fall 2003 efforts will keep the movie-going public well entertained till The Matrix Revolutions arrives in November.My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B)",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
103,SILENCEikillyou,Good...,7,10 March 2004,"This was a good movie.  Not much else to say about it that you can't read on the back of the box.  Action, violence, sexy Selma Hayek, guns, and some quirky humor.  It's better than the first one, but partly in that I think Depp's character adds a quality that was lacking in the first.  PLUS (and I don't mind swearing all that much; and even like it sometimes) there isn't as much of the F-word in this one, that helps.  The action is good, the performances good, and the story is ok.  That's all.This isn't the deepest movie, but I think most people will enjoy it some if there's not much else to do.  I voted 7/10 because i like Depp and Hayek in it.  Everything else was good too, but would have warranted only 6 instead. Thank you",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
104,timothyhilditch,A flower surrounded by a mess,5,19 September 2021,"If you are looking for another el mariachi movie this isn't it. This is some weird parody spy thriller. Where ""El"" is just a side character.It starts off slow, then the plot confuses itself, making it hard to follow. The action is poor compared to the first two movies. With a couple of plot lines to follow not leaving another time for most characters. The bad acting doesn't come off as funny, and the action cuts as fast as a blender. Leaving nothing to see.Johnny Depp's performance steals the show as a corrupt CIA agent. Providing great scenes and great lines.

105,marcotiero,Once upon a convoluted mess!,5,19 June 2020,"Unfortunately, this third installment of the Mariachi series let's down the franchise.The story and plots are so convoluted that it doesn't make sense and doesn't flow. While Desperado thrived on a simple story with great action set pieces, this movie's only saving grace is the fun action. The rest of the time is just a snoozefest. El Mariachi's flashbacks are sporadic, and slowly reveal what has happened since the last movie, but I think this was poorly executed and could have just all been told at the start. I also didn't get that Carolina was with General Marquez, when she's been with the Mariachi since the last movie. If she was with Marquez before him, why would she have been taking money from Bucho? Did she leave the Mariachi then go back to him? It doesn't make sense.There are far too many characters with little screen time, so the viewer doesn't get to know the characters, and therefore nobody cares about any of them.It's a shame that this movie was letdown by an attempt at a vast storyline, because it could have been excellent if it was done right. Desperado expanded on the original Mariachi movie, by adding a bit more depth and expanding the universe, this could have continued the same way, instead less would have been more in this case.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
106,PeachesIR,Entertaining and fun,8,22 June 2020,"I loved this movie, and enjoyed it as a parody of action films and Mexican drug warlord dramas. ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" is overflowing with stars, even in smaller roles, and everyone seemed to be having a blast. Johnny Depp stands out as smarmy, corrupt CIA agent Sheldon Sands, complete with tacky tourist t-shirts and fanny pack in a few scenes. It's his funniest role ever, but he also manages to be cute and sexy. Antonio Banderas is the ostensible hero, El, a mariachi, folk hero and gunfighter rolled into one, with Enrique Iglesias and Marco Leonardi as his sidekicks. The gunfights are over the top, with people flying 20 feet into the air after being shot and Banderas leaping across buildings as if he were superhuman. The plot is flimsy, only there to provide enough structure to support the satiric skewering of movie cliches by the excellent cast: Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Eva Mendes, Ruben Blades, Willem Dafoe, Salma Hayek and Mickey Rourke. Just kick back and enjoy the action and laughs.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
107,paul-nemecek,"Inspired moments, but . . .",6,7 July 2018,"I like films where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. In the best films, individual elements of the film are good, but the dynamic synergy between the pieces is so good that something magic happens and some good pieces of film coalesce into an outstanding work of art. This, alas, is not the case with Once Upon a Time in Mexico. There are some great scenes, some very good performances, and some individual elements (cinematography and editing) that are very good. But in the end the film is a predictable story with a muddled narrative and occasional flashes of brilliance sprinkled liberally around.One of those flashes of brilliance is Johnny Depp as a CIA agent who is charged with restoring order in Mexico. In an early scene in the film, agent Sands is explaining the importance of order as he eats dinner at a restaurant. He explains that he has been eating pork in restaurants all over Mexico and that the pork at this restaurant is so delicious and so good that he will have to kill the chef so that balance is restored to the order of things.This scene is reflective in some ways of many of the parts of the film. Johnny Depp has made a career of playing offbeat or quirky characters (Edward Scissorhands, Benny and Joon, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Chocolat, Blow, etc.). He steals the show here just as he did in Pirates of the Caribbean. I actually like the bizarre elements of this scene because it shows the folly of using disorder to restore order. Unfortunately, deep themes are relatively scarce here, and while the folly of violence is questioned here, it is celebrated without reservation throughout most of the film. To observant students of film this will come as no surprises. This film is actually the third in a trilogy that started with El Mariachi and Desperado. Antonio Banderas reprises his earlier role and does an excellent job. Roger Ebert compares these films to Sergio Leone's ""spaghetti westerns"" A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More.As a celebration of kinetic energy or as homage to beautifully choreographed acts of violence, Once Upon a Time in Mexico is stunning. There are excellent supporting performances by Salma Hayek, Willem Defoe, and Mickey Rourke. But in the end we are left with a film that is shallow and hollow or-- in the words of a pretty decent playwright--""full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
108,GeorgeSickler,"Viva ""El Mariachi""!!!",8,11 August 2010,"I think this is another fun movie in the series, and well worth watching.Perhaps some people who are critical of the plot, story-line, etc., should know or be reminded that ""El Mariachi"" is a famous and popular comic book character in Mexico. The movie is tongue-in-cheek, just as are the comic book stories featuring ""El Mariachi."" But he's not wearing a costume like Superman, Batman, Spiderman and a host of others, who are featured in large-budget movies with bizarre plots and characters.So, ""give it a break!"" :-) What's also fun for me, at least, is a lot of the scenes were filmed here in San Miguel de Allende, as well as in the neighboring larger cities of Queretero and Guanajuato. We've eaten in the same restaurants, walked the same streets, entered the Gothic Catholic church here in San Miguel (the only 'Goth' south of the Rio Grande/Bravo), and get a kick out of it when a character turns a street corner in San Miguel, and they're suddenly on a street in one of the other towns -- and vice versa.It just seems to me viewers should keep in mind that ""El Mariachi's"" signature-piece is a guitar filled with a variety of weapons to fight crime, injustice and uphold ""The Mexican Way."" He can do that without having a costume, or have have the ability to fly faster than a speeding bullet, soar from building to building with his spider webs, or drive his Batmobile and fight The Penguin, The Riddler, The Joker, Batwoman, et. al. Well, people who keep that in mind just might enjoy the movie.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
109,DjfunkmasterG,Very Let down,7,14 September 2003,"Once upon a time in mexico there was a film made on the smallest of Budget's... That Film was El Mariachi, that film was brought to us By Director and Writer... Robert Rodriguez. In 1995 a sequel emerged ""Desperado"" starring Antonio Banderas as the Revenge seeking Guitarist who wanted to Rid his fair land of Drug dealers and Criminal types.
Now we have the 3rd entry ..... ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"" where we find our Mariachi, trying to forget the blood he has shed and try to rebuild what life he had. This soon goes right down the tubes when he is Found by a Corrupt CIA agent(Johnny Depp), who wants him to kill the man that mariachi has the most hate for. That man is also trying to kill Mexico's president.As the film unveils we see flashbacks to the first 2 films, and we also find out that Mariachi and Carolina had so much love for each other........But I won't give it all away.Mariachi accepts the mission as laid out by the CIA agent and of course the rest is Cliched Action Film making. The film runs about 100 mins but I felt like I was there about 3 hours. The action sequences are a bit over the top, but very enjoyable. The problem with ""Mexico"" is that it didn't have all the fun that Desperado had. This entry into the Mariachi Series is very dark and centered around Revenge. I went in expecting a ""Desperado"" and what I got was a ""Death Wish"". Not that i don't like a great revenge filled film....It's just that the original ""El Mariachi"" and ""Desperado"" didn't have that Revenge feeling to them, they were great action films that had great stories and plenty of fun was put into making these films.""Mexico"" Seemed to forget that formula, was it by accident or meant that way will forever be a mystery.....But if you liked the Previous 2 Mariachi films...

The film is definetely worth the price of admission with lots of plot twists and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. To me the original is still the best as always is the case.

The latter was a good action movie that went nowhere fast, that is, there was no plot other than the fact that people wanted to kill the good guy and no matter how hard they tried, they just couldn't. Once Upon a Time has a plot that is far more complex. Far more complex! And that's where the problem starts. The movie is unable to keep up with its own plot. The scenes seem disconnected from one another, as if we were watching two movies at the same time, and one has nothing to do with the other. Mindless violence, a sadistic CIA agent you feel no sympathy for, a drug dealer and a general that seem to be screaming at the cameras ""I am bad! Look at me, I am bad!"" turn this movie into the kind of stuff you can tolerate only if you have a good stomach and you happen to like anti-heroes way too much. Possible spoilers ahead!The film seems to have a defect we also saw in Desperado: in that film we didn't know why the bad guy had killed the good guy's girlfriend. In this film, we don't know why the bad General wanted the good guy and his girlfriend killed. Once again, we are supposed to guess. And we are supposed to guess why the entire Mexican town was armed and ready for the coup the General had prepared for the President.A good ending and good actors, a plot that seems taken out of the movie Traffic make the film almost tolerable.

114,PenOutOfTime,Takes stylization to the extreme,4,3 April 2007,"""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" shows off Robert Rodriguez's affinity for comic books to a fault, displaying enormous style, and liberally dousing the film in charismatic violence, but this comic book connection is so prominent that the film fails to make an impact in its own medium. Most of the characters have great conceptual appeal, but this possibility is never fully realized with the detailing that connects the audience to the characters. This lack is further nurtured by Antonio Banderas, who as usual coasts on his looks, serving as a fleshly puppet for dialog and action sequences.Unrealistic, albeit imaginative action further serves to isolate the viewer from the story. The plot is actually quite worthy for a pure action film of this type, although it is sufficiently complex that some viewers would only be further annoyed.Overall, this is not an terrible movie, but rather, is a movie that is sufficiently stylized that it would appeal most to a young audience (problematic with its R rating).",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

Not to mention the characters who were actually somewhat interesting and not stolen, which has got to be a first when it comes to the action genre. I can honestly say that I enjoyed all of the characters, even that stupid Taco Bell type dog that the American carried around and put a wiretap on. I really don't have too many complaints about the movie, and thought it was interesting throughout.El was a crazy, crazy man. If cornered by a massive army, he would just whip out his guitar and fire off grenades and laser beams taking everyone out, saving his guitar until the end.

There was too much attention given to the action sequences and much too little to the romance and character development. It seemed to me that the story suffered from too many characters that all had to be followed around in their action adventures.Way too little of Salma Hayek as well. She should have got much more screen time to balance the story. 5/10",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

Robert Rodriguez has done it again, however from Desperado i didn't ever catch on to the fan chain that Antonio Banderas has held. I only Really enjoyed this film, because of Johnny Depp. And of course Willem Dafoe, Mickey Rourke, and Eva Mendes were also some of my favorites. During the movie, i noticed many 'Robert Rodriguez type' things that you could tell only came from certain directing. This movie didn't lack any sense of Rodriguez style, it held his reputation up high. And most people think this movie is all hype, but i beg to differ in that statement. There was nothing in the previous that wasn't talked about in the movie. Yes Johnny Depp was a psychotic CIA agent and yes the general is corrupt, all true in the film.

But I just couldn't figure out who was on what side when.  Nor could I tell why people were being killed.  Just a mish-mash of unconnected killings.  I would guess we are done with El Mariachi?  The first one was really good.  Then Desperado was good because you could follow the plot.  Sure there was plenty of violence, but what would you expect.  But in ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" it seems like some psychologist must have gotten involved in the writing and did a typical psychology hatchet job.

123,pc_dean,"Como se dice ""Spaghetti Western?""",8,23 September 2003,"Evidently, Robert Rodriguez has decided that he wants to be Sergio Leone when he grows up.  And if his latest movie is any guide, he's well on his way. Not that this is a bad thing.  Leone is most famous for his `Spaghetti Westerns', which shook up the creaky black-vs-white-hat conventions of the Western form that became entrenched during the 1950s, and made an icon out of a former gas station attendant named Clint Eastwood.  There's a lot of Leone in `Once Upon a Time in Mexico', Rodriguez's latest entry in his signature `Mariachi' series, following El `Mariachi' and `Desperado'.  The new movie, whose title is an homage to Leone's `Once Upon a Time in the West', is an epic opera of blood, dust, and vengeance that would have made the master smile.Mexico follows series hero El Mariachi (amusingly called `El' for short) as he is dragged from the shadows of obscure legend and into the sneaky plotting of a gleefully amoral CIA operative (Johnny Depp, every inch the charming sociopath).  The plot concerns an attempt by a corrupt general in the employ of a vicious cartel boss (Willem Dafoe) to assassinate Mexico's president and seize power in a coup.  Depp wants to prevent the general's rise to power (but not, he makes clear, the murder of the president), and to that end enlists/ dragoons Banderas, who has a serious grudge against General Marquez.Rodriguez aims for epic sweep, and the story becomes quite dense and twisty, involving a great many characters, including Eva Mendes as a cagey federalista, and Ruben Blades as a retired FBI agent who has lost too many friends and seen too many enemies escape.  The grand scheme of the plot both helps and hurts the movie; it's involved and interesting, but contributes to the movie's being somewhat overlong and losing its focus by the end.  `Mexico' is less comedic than `Desperado' (though it has some charming jokes and references to the earlier movies - check out the Chihuahua's name tag!), and touches more directly on serious issues affecting contemporary Mexico, including corruption in the military, the narco-tyranny of the cartels, and the fragility of democratic institutions in a country wracked by conflict. Rodriguez has said he did not intend `Mexico' as a political statement, but the movie is heavily and often poignantly flavored with Mexican patriotism.Rodriguez knows how to handle a cast, and this one, which includes faces who have worked with him many times before, does not disappoint.  Whatever else he may do, Antonio Banderas will probably always be remembered for the character he creates in these movies.  His Mariachi is a hero of wounded power, whose brooding silences, quiet voice, and soulful eyes remind us that revenge, the most common action-movie motivation around, is inexplicably linked with horrific loss.  Banderas' characterization is so good, that one quickly forgave him for stealing the role from Carlos Gallardo, who likably originated it in `El Mariachi' (Gallardo has, happily, not been cast aside; he had a cameo in `Desperado', and has shared producer credit on the entire series).No one, however, is having nearly as much fun in this movie as Johnny Depp, whose Agent Sands is a happy-go-lucky nihilist who carries off any scene that isn't nailed down.  He is a remorseless murderer, but a charming one, and so by the perverse moral logic of movies, sympathetic; he also provides the bulk of the comic relief.  His presence in the movie is not nearly as extensive as you might think, given his prominent billing (the same is true of Salma Hayek, who is billed second, but whose role is essentially a glorified cameo).Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo, frequent Rodriguez collaborators, appear as vivid lowlifes (though not the same vivid lowlifes they played in `Desperado'; those were deceased by the closing credits).  Blades is excellent as the reluctant FBI agent, a tired man of integrity who discovers that years of retirement cannot dim his anger at the ones who got away.  Dafoe is appropriately sinister, though his performance makes one keenly aware just how cliched the Latin American drug kingpin villain has become.  Mickey Rourke serves as Dafoe's right-hand man, and seems to be channeling the late, great Johnny Cash in what I have to confess is the only Mickey Rourke performance I have ever truly enjoyed.  The main problem in the cast is not bad performance, just that the huge scope Rodriguez brings to the movie involves too many people, and limits the amount of time each has to establish themselves.  Enrique Iglesias and Marco Leonardi, in particular, create less memorable characters as Banderas' backup men than did Gallardo and Albert Michel Jr. in `Desperado' (who didn't even have any lines.)When, in true Western style, Banderas inevitably straps on his six-million- shooters to do battle with the Bad Guys, Rodriguez also delivers thundering, amped-up action sequences, which evoke the Hong Kong style without merely imitating it.  Rodriguez's gun battle set pieces are ballistic expressions of gruesome joy, and he gives us a number of them, including a frenetic running battle and motorcycle chase (appropriately set to `Pistolero' by Juno Reactor, the hardest-working electronica band in movies), leading up to a ferocious street battle during the coup attempt on Dia de Los Muertos.  Fans of Leone will notice many of his trademark close-ups of squinting eyes and poetic, stylish showdowns.  Rodriguez also tweaks playfully with the visual vocabulary of Westerns; instead of horses materializing on the horizon or the noon train steaming in the distance as harbingers of impending danger, we get battered pickup trucks driving in clouds of dust, laden down with grim, unshaven men with sunglasses and automatic weapons.  The Banditos Cometh. `Once Upon a Time in Mexico' is not quite as good as its predecessors, but it still provides a blazing good time for Western fans and gun fetishists alike.

124,swipht1,Very good action movie. *SPOILERS*,10,14 September 2003,"I thought the action scenes were very well done. The plot was very strong, although a bit confusing at points. It was all very well explained. Johnny Depp once again proves that he can do anything. He adds that touch of humour to a quite dramatic scene. Also, his gunslinging heroic moment near the end after he gets his eyes cut out was very impressive. The only problem was that Salma Hayek was included as one of the main characters, but she was only in some of the flashbacks because she died. I thought that this wasn't the best idea to kill off one of the main characters. I thought El Mariachi's friends in ""Desperado"" were cooler as well.

The image of the wandering guitar player--the mariachi-- harking back to the days of the medieval troubadours has a certain amount of wistful charm. Too bad Rodriguez could not do something more imaginative with that image, but once again he depends entirely on violence and stunts. This viewer found it all achingly dull. Rodriguez's technical expertise can be appreciated by cinephiles, but the rest of the audience is looking for a coherent story and will get bored with all the shooting and blood. Antonio Banderas is a big impressive man and a capable actor, but he is ill-used in stuff like this. Johny Depp was better as the drag queen in Before Night Falls.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
126,Clockwork-Avacado,"Look OUT, Fans of Salma Hayek!",4,14 October 2014,"What I actually thought of this low-brow, mock-exploitation film is largely irrelevaent, given the general lack of any serious attempt to present anything more than 90 minutes of bizarre, escapist wham-bang action. Like Rodriguez subsequent, and better known ""Machete"" franchise, this features a bunch of Mexican, and not so Mexican guys posing around, looking cool, and blowing things up/shooting things. That's basically it. In fact, its' aesthetic is so similair to the MAchete films, that it makes you wonder whether Rodriguez is stuck in something of a rut. Anyway, though, if you have to watch this movie, then I'd recommend you watch it for Johnny Depp being a bad ass as usual, with his third-arm gimmick, and his distinctly annoying, but you like him anyway style. In fact, by the end of the film, he's the only thing worth watching, if you'll pardon the pun. Not that Antonio Banderas is a bad lead, but moping about doesn't exactly suit such a film, and that's basically all that he does. Shoots a load of people, then has a mope. Does this a couple of times, then that's the film over. But, like I said. Not the real point here.THE REAL POINT - is to warn anybody who looks at the cover of this movie and thinks, ""Oh, A kind of rubbish looking film with Salma Hayek in it,"" then buys it for that very reason. Despite being large on the cover, and second in the cast list, I feel it is my duty to warn the world that SALMA HAYEK IS BARELY EVEN IN THIS FILM. This is a classic case of deliberate misrepresentation, on the part of the film-makers who obviously felt that selling this movie as nothing but a macho-posturing movie would hurt their sales. And they'd be right. Oh, those cunning devils, who knew that she's the best actress in this movie by some considerable margin, that she's basically the only reason why I even watched this film. To be featured so large in the promotional material, and to have about four minutes of screen time, all in hugely irrelevant flashback sequences, is definitely a crime, not to mention the fact that it's a decidedly undignified role for her even when she is on screen. So, if, like me, you love Salma Hayek, as one of the sexiest screen presences in film, and you think this will constitute ""A Salma Hayek Film"", then you're totally wrong, oh my brothers (and sisters). 'Tis a travesty, indeed, and a massive waste of talent. Now, excuse me. I'm off to rewatch ""Savages"" again. I may be gone for some time.

The reason I had such high hopes was, ofcourse, that it's predecessor, Desperado, was such an excellent movie. Once upon a time in mexico (herafter called ""the movie"") lacks in almost every area that desperado excelled in. I can't help but feel his little spy kids projects have spoiled Rodriguez a bit. The action in the movie is sometimes a bit over the top, in a totally uncool, sometimes even childish way. Fake CGI and gas explosions are used too much, and people fly and jump just a little too much for my tastes. Effects of the action are a bit too comic sometimes. Desperado had much better action.Although lacking a story too, Desperado at least didn't pretend to have one.
The movie pretended to have Salma Hayek in it. She wasn't on screen more then 5 minutes, unfortunately. Huge bummer for us guys.And the soundtrack, well, it's actually pretty good! But still, the Tito&Tarantula soundtrack from Desperado is almost unequalled.Still, the movie is highly enjoyable. Lots of action, one-liners and excellent performances from the cast, especially Depp. (Who seems to be in all the right movies in the right roles these days.

The fact that it has a complex plot (albeit with some small holes) was a bonus to me as I like to watch an action film you have to actually think about and pay attention to.The music for Once Upon a Time in Mexico was also very good, I must get around to buying that soundtrack....

I really enjoyed watching this film. Great visual style, fast paced action, cool characters - just about everything that makes a movie fun and entertaining. Of course some scenes were over the top and there wasn't much realism, but what did you expect? This is a movie that has fake arms and flame-throwing guitars in it, so anyone complaining about lack of realism is missing the point here. The acting (in my opinion) was quite good and I especially enjoyed Depp. He puts on a great performance, but I guess this is not a big surprise - he usually does. What was a big surprise was E. Inglesias' performance. Hey, this guy acts better than he sings. Maybe a career change is in order.I only got a minor complaint about the movie.(***possible spoilers here***) Dafoe's part was really small. So much so that I didn't actually care when he got killed in the end. And he was supposed to be the main villain. But still this wasn't bad enough to ruin the whole movie.I read somewhere that it was Tarantino that persuaded Rodriguez to make this film.

There were just too many characters that detracted from the protagonist. It was unnecessary to have that many players to convey the exposition. The plot get's confusing with all the characters working against or for the others. The action is nothing innovative, but done in such a way to add some humor. Banderas probably got a good deal signing on; considering he probably was the first actor signed on for the lead. But consequentially, was no more than a supporting actor rather than the lead. All for the sake of redundant characters to establish their M.O. during the course of the flick. So while this isn't a bad flick, it's just an overly ambitious one.

When I saw the heavyweight talent that he had assembled for this, I considered it a can't miss. Sure, there were stories floating around down here in Austin that this was a stinker. Rodriguez gave an early screening of it down here and even the his fellow Austinites were holding their noses. However, I was a fan and willing to give it a fair shot. Well, I saw it and it was probably the most difficult movie I have ever had to sit through. This thing was so bad on so many levels. You had actors literally being wasted in front of your eyes. You had a script that was as lifeless as the phoned in performances. Moreover, this film had a look like it had been recorded on a cheap camcorder. The whole film looks like a bad soap opera on the Mexican cable station. How anybody could give high marks to this video amazes me. However, I would guess that the fans of this film, did not see the other two. It is sad, because after ""From Dusk Till Dawn,"" I thought Rodriguez would be a great film maker.

It had a very different feel than the first two movies, it was more stylish, had a more rounded story, and more interesting characters (all of which are good things), but it had less action (which was the disappointing part).I might even be giving the movie more credit than it deserves because I so greatly respect Rodriguez's one man band operation. And I'm really glad that he's getting back to making good movies (after the Spy Kids series and the Faculty). Overall I give the movie *** out of four stars.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
143,daisuke69,"can you say, downward spiral?",4,22 January 2005,"I heard the rumors... this movie is good... this movie is fun...well it's not that good and it's not all that fun either. Granted, you'll see your explosions, and your gunfights, and cute girls and handsome guys... but that just doesn't cut it here. Somehow robert rodriguez said... let's repeat the formula of guns and babes and explosions from desperado and throw in some extra plot twists... well I don't know what pipe he was hitting when he wrote this but the story is a convoluted plot that tries to go every which way and instead of you thinking ""wow what a great plot twist"" you just go ""what the hell"". Add this to some pretty bad camera work, lame supporting actors and horribly unbelievable gunfights and goriness, and you have a movie that really doesn't cut it.I'll have to admit that some actors did very well. Antonio Banderas does a great job as the mariachi, ruben blades acts OK, but he should have gotten another part. Johnny depp is good as usual but his already polished and familiar psychotic/compulsive character doesn't work that well for some reason.Overall this movie does nothing whatsoever for the story of el mariachi except pull out a sad ending to the hopeful last scenes of desperado.Watch this if you have nothing better to do, if there's anything else to watch, get that instead and save yourself the loss of time 4/10",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
144,DarkLugia1969,Robert Rodriguez Hits A Triple!!!,9,25 September 2003,"-Note this comments may contains spoilers so you have been warned-Mr. Robert Rodriguez has done it again for 2003.  First with Spy Kids 3 and now the final chapter in the ""El Mariachi"" series.  This soon to be cult hit has Mr. Banderas as the gunslinging guitarist who is involved in a case with Mr. Depp who plays a pork-eating psychotic CIA agent who must capture a drug lord as well as a Mexican general.During the flashbacks of ""El"" is the alluring Miss Hayek who is seen briefly in the movie is the reason why the character of Mr. Banderas has return.The good points of this movie is the subtitles and the characters in the movie speaking spanish.  Also, like most of Mr. Rodriquez films is has so much comedy even though it has lots of action just like in the Spy Kids films.  Also, the style of this movie reminds me of his first cult hit of ""El Mariachi"" the same filming technique that made it a filming sensation.Overall, this movie deserves its justice and its due for soon to be cult classic and hopefully that they put it in in a dvd package of the El Mariachi series.The Dark Gengar gives this excellent action film from one Gengar to Ten Gengars:  A High Nine Gengars.  Take care and enjoy the movies!!!  Adios!!!",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
145,Sevenmercury7,Messy,4,22 April 2007,"I think this will be remembered as Rodriguez's vanity project, a film so indulgent it makes a strong case for studio control. Its narrative is feeble, its caricatures squeezed into the plot, and even much of the action is repetitive. Rodriguez is an inventive filmmaker, but he's certainly no artist, as this, the third part of his personal Mariachi trilogy, proves.Of the cast, Ruben Blades is good as an ex-FBI agent persuaded to avenge his partner, while Johnny Depp steals the film from just about everyone, including the director. The rest of this bloodbath is pretty much a bore. Banderas' character is reduced to an extremely silly comic book hero - more interested in his guitar than he is of avenging his woman (a redundant cameo from Salma Hayek).Rodriguez intended this as his Leone trilogy, but as over the top as those Dollars films were, there was more gravitas in one frame than in the whole of this daft pastiche.Overstuffed and very silly, this is a disappointing effort.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

Cartoonish action without any fun, interesting, or distinguishable choreography; a convoluted plot that undercuts its ""twists"" by not being careful enough to set them up interestingly; a bunch of postering and foolishness from the actors; bad direction; sloppy, crappy editing; a much-publicized digital look that still leaves a lot to be desired; and absolute tedium for the audience.

But the problem is, Once Upon a Time in Mexico is not really a sequel to those films...for one thing, it's not really a film, it's digital video.  And boy, does it look like video.  The fire from explosions is freaking ORANGE, for cryin' out loud.  Ugh.  There's not a single shot in the movie that truly looks good.Which I could forgive, if the storyline had been entertaining.  But too many plot twists, double-crosses, double agents, look-alikes with plastic surgery, supporting characters by the dozen...I'm sorry, but this movie simply had TOO MUCH PLOT.  That's not a phrase you hear often, but I think it applies to Once Upon a Time.  El Mariachi is a supporting character in his own film, and Agent Sands (by far the best character) isn't given enough screen time, even though he probably has more than any other character.  We watch an endless parade of supporting characters betray each other, until we give up any attempt of figuring the whole thing out.I did like Agent Sands.  And I liked some of the humorous dialogue, especially in the first 30 minutes.  And the action scenes are cool, even if they look like s*** because it's on video.

148,parsleylion,a really hopeless effort of a film: terrible B-movie botched job,5,7 March 2004,"set in a present-day Mexico that looks like the backlot of a studio, this film trys to be cool and isn't. The story is simple, a coup against the President of Mexico organised by a drugs baron sees a CIA agent (Johnny Depp making the most of a weird role) recruit El Mariachi and his buddies to thwart the bad guys. There are various sub-plots like the drug barons Mexican Federal agent daughter, Eva Mendes doing her bit for girl power or the retired FBI agent recruited by Depp's character in another hairbrained scheme to see off the bad guys. A great cast including Willem Dafoe, Salma Hayek, Antonio Banderas etc etc are wasted because the director was not rigorous enough about the script, it sags with the weight of ideas, and lunatic marvellous camera work wasted on unimportant storylines and the whole thing carries no credibilty even as a tongue-in-cheek work. It's one of those can't make up it's mind what it wants to be affairs. It needed the tension of a film like Traffic's treatment of Mexico, with the comedy and violence of a spaghetti western but what comes out of the blend of talents is a A-team like story crossed with a Woody Allen's coup done in Bananas with the result the audience get to see a B-movie toting itself as an A-list affair.

Throw all of that out the window.  Once Upon a Time in Mexico is about enticing legends that get tossed around in dusty old towns, it's about the ridiculous brashness of Johnny Depp's undercover espionage, it's about the melody of bullets around which the characters must frequently dance, and it's about the ultimate coolness of Antonio Banderas' outlaw gunslinger.This movie is all about style over substance.

150,to_kill_better,Best Action Film of Recent Years,10,22 March 2004,"What a spectacularly silly movie this is! It has a completely unfollowable plot. Unrealistic action. A few pointless characters. And it's FANTASTIC! After years of playing quirky but ultimately serious roles, Johnny Depp seems to have recently found his niche playing tongue-in-cheek characters. His corrupt and thoroughly devious CIA agent (complete with ""CIA"" printed in big letters on his T-Shirt...) steals the show in the way only a good remorseless villain can. Antonio Banderas smoulders suitably, without taking himself too seriously, as the straight-arrow hero, and there's a suitably menacing turn from Danny Trejo as a truly comic-book henchman.
But don't get me wrong. This isn't one of those ""so bad it's good"" movies. It's a truly brilliant high-speed brawl of a film with non-stop gunfights, one-liners and sight gags. If you're an action movie fan, the benchmark of the moment seems to be Kill Bill, so maybe I should just say that this is considerably better than Kill Bill and leave it at that. You won't be sitting stroking your beard and thinking about the subtleties of the movie's dialogue, but you will acknowledge, as I did, that this is a superb piece of entertainment.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

Once Upon a Time demonstrates that concept, but the action in this picture is well worth it. The plot is something about an assassination attempt on the President of Mexico. Or something. And some double crossing. Johnny Depp deftly plays a CIA agent who is doing more double crossing. The only characters we know about for sure are El Mariachi (Antonio simply rehashing his previous role) and his 2 compadres. But if you don't get wrapped too around the who is doing what to whom and just hang on for the ride, you won't be disappointed.

Simply, it wasn't Desperado...it didn't have the charisma, character, and simplicity. There wasn't one character I liked, the plot was ridiculously hard to follow, and the action scenes were a joke. It pains me greatly to say such things about a Rodriguez film, but there is a lot to live up to from Desperado.

154,Skip_4591,"Great, Fantastic Movie, but a little too dark.",10,28 August 2006,"This was a fantastic adventure. Great movie. The action was astounding, the story was incredible, and the acting was just plain great. However, the only thing that makes this movie not as good as ""Desperado"" is that it's just too plain dark. There's too much brutality, not enough humor, and the bad guy does too many sick things. Desperado was comical, light, and fun. This was fun too, but not comical, or light, which takes away some of the fun. But still, its a great movie, and the action scenes are astounding.Johnny Depp is the scene-stealer in this movie (like in many of his movies). He plays Sands, a rogue CIA agent who's a bit of a psycho (in one part, the food he eats at a restaurant is so good that he shoots the cook, for example!). He is also super-cool, with his third, fake arm and all (don't worry, you'll see what I mean!).There is also a bit of CGI work in this movie, and it's all virtually unnoticeable. The only parts I noticed were CGI were parts when people got hit by cars, but the only reason I noticed they were CGI was because I was aware of what could be practically done and what couldn't in the movie industry, and getting rammed by cars can't be practically done without killing a few people! :) But otherwise, all the CGI was great (its incredible that half the time, the bullets hitting the walls and people were done with CGI and not squibs, and some gunfire was also done using CGI; i didn't notice it at all until i watched the special feature on the DVD about the special effects...its great work).Once again Robert Rodruguez proves he is a fantastic director! And editor, and composer, and cinematographer, blah blah blah.... :) Seriously its amazing how much he can do in a movie...the music by him in the movie is great...i especially love the ""Pistolero"" song track playing during the car chase involving Mariachi and a few thugs on motorcycles! There are also some parts where the action is so fast and extreme and energetic that the editing can't keep up! There were parts where the guns had no sound effects attached, the movie is that energetic and intense. It's not a bad thing actually; its so cool.Also, the digital video does prove to be better than film in this movie. It's incredible.The action is highly energetic. The acting is top-notch. The editing is masterful. The sound is as it should be: amazing.This is a masterpiece. it could have been a better masterpiece had it been a little less brutal, but its a masterpiece nonetheless.I give it a 10 out of 10.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

My only problem with the movie was that two actors that were killed in the first movie (Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo) were featured in this movie.

I figured Once Upon a Time in Mexico would be his masterpiece as the last in the El Mariachi trilogy.Is the Mariachi in the film?  Yes, but you would be amazed how much he is not in the film.  Depp is amazing as usual but this film is a cluttered mess as is the plot.  Again, the screenplay seems to have taken a backseat to over-the-top action.  Now that is action is QUITE amazing.  But the movie feels like it takes years to finish.  It's pretty bad when I sit in the theater and look at my watch once, thinking it's running long.  I looked at my watch five times during this film.El Mariachi in my eyes is an amazing classic, Desperado is its over-the-top successor, and Once Upon A Time in Mexico is the ugly step-brother who I saw once and can lock back in his room.

And it's a decent movie, but it's not as good as Desperado. I'm not sure why Salma Hayek gets a top billing, her screen time is about 5 minutes (must have a good agent) and it was all in flashback/dream mode. Which really isn't as effective as it would have been to just pick up this movie where they left off in Desperado, driving away in the jeep, settling down.... making a family... etc. Not only would we have gotten to see more of Salma, but it'd pull us more into the movie, rather than just watching it go by. The flashback thing just didn't work for me here.Additionally, this sequel fails in one way just like the Matrix 2, in that it forgot one of the main characters: the music. In both Matrix and Desperado the music was an integral character in the movie helping to tell the story. I really liked it. It helps to bring the viewer into the movie at a higher level. But both Matrix 2 and OUTM the music is just in the background, not part of the story. Big mistake in my opinion.Antonio Banderas is excellent and really is El Mariachi.  Salma Hayek is of course beautiful, but that's really all we get to see of her in this movie. (One short, impossible, fight scene; one short, impossible, ""escape"" scene; and a few ""family moments""). Sure would have been nice to see her acting. Then there's Johnny Depp... while I'm a great Depp fan, he seems to be on auto pilot here. He could have been funnier, meaner, more arrogant, and more selfish and it would have been a better movie. Instead he's just ""a bad cia guy."" I know it sounds like I'm blasting the movie, but it's a good movie, and I'd recommend going to see it.

160,ChavRose06,"Loved it, however Mr Rodriguez you should of...",10,7 November 2004,"Director Robert Rodriguez finally dishes out his third and final installment of his 'El Mariachi' trilogy, we present to you 'Once Upon A Time In Mexico', story of a gun slinging guitar playing hero who is hired by a corrupt CIA agent for a mission to kill General Marquez and save the President of Mexico from being murdered, sounds interesting? It sure does.Don't get me wrong I love Mr. Robert Rodriguez with a passion because he is on my long list of directors I aspire to. But there was so much more he could of done with this film. As a dedicated film lover and animation student I will list a few.Okay first of all, great cast, no mistake there, Johnny Depp was banging as the corrupt CIA Agent Sands, Antonio Banderas made us all swoon again as El Mariachi and Salma Hayek we barely got to see at all because we find out she is dead. Also joining the kick-ass cast were Willem Dafoe, Eva Mendes, Mickey Rourke, Ruben Blades and surprisingly Enrique Iglesias, just to name a few.Now most movie-viewers will tell you the movie has no real plot, well I hate it to break it to those people but you just didn't pay attention to the film now did you? Yes the film does have a plot you just have to pay attention to it.Okay the other actors casted were stand outs but during the film you realized they needed more to do, I wasn't sure if Mr Rodriquez wanted to leave that open so fan fiction writers would have their fun. But I let that slide.Special features on the DVD are the best! You realize how much effort was put into this film, from special effects to advantages in shooting in HD (trust me if you study film or animation, watch this!) and we get to learn how to cook Puerco Pibil, a certain roasted pork dish that was the absolute favourite of Agent Sands that drove him crazy and made him shoot the cook in the film. If there was anything I could change about this movie as a director it would have been to give Agent Ajedrez (Eva Mendes) more screen time and expanded her relationship with Agent Sands (Johnny Depp), maybe given them a little love scene. Honestly I wouldn't mind seeing Mendes and Depp work together again on another film, because I thought they had steamy chemistry on-screen together. Also would have given a name to El Mariachi and Carolina's child (who is also dead in the film). And maybe even expand the details of the main characters backgrounds, so we don't end up wondering.To end it off, I enjoyed the movie if weren't for little things I will push aside.

161,ramshot,Absolutely horrible *spoiler warning*,2,26 October 2003,"I just came back from an all-night-long movie festival here in Helsinki and among the 6 other movies shown, was Once Upon a Time in Mexico.  Out of all the 7 movies shown, I believed it to be a sure bet, at least entertainment-wise. I had 4 friends with me, each of us absolutely loved Desperado, and each and every one of us were just completely stunned after the movie. Just so this won't turn into a pointless rant...-It'd be nice if an ""action"" movie had some action.-It'd be nice if the little action an action movie has was not completely ruined by idiotic screenplay and utterly horrendous directing. What has happened to Robert Rodriguez in the recent years, god only knows.-It'd be nice to see the main characters some instead of watching Johnny Depp play an utterly uninteresting wannabe-witty character. I've never seen Depp act so bad. Shiver.-It's bad enough if a movie has an uninteresting plot, but several story lines in the same movie, all of them equally hard to follow since none of them are interesting and they are mixed together in a horrible mess... That's just pain.-The dialogue was just incredibly... dull, predictable, stupid. All the ""one-liners"" were just plain dry and old. Nobody in the theater laughed, and this was a _festival audience_, lord o mighty, people were laughing at anything even remotely amusing.I am going to rate this movie as a ""2/10"". I've seen and rated worse movies, but this is the lowest rating I've given on imdb. Why? This movie could and should have been mediocre in the very least. It had good actors, marvelous prequels and a director who at least once directed good movies. The result was a horrible movie which I'm having a hard time putting into any genre because of lack of any real content or entertainment value, and my 2/10 points go to all of the people involved in making this movie the horrible mess it is.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
162,djelvis2,"Plot, schmot, it's one of the best action films in a looong time(SPOILERS)...",9,11 February 2004,"I have to take issue with everybody whining about the weak plot, for two basic reasons:1)  This is an action movie, in the vein of ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST and DRUNKEN MASTER II.  Were you expecting THE USUAL SUSPECTS?  TRAFFIC?  SEVEN SAMURAI?  While the structure's not as inventive as PULP FICTION or MEMENTO, there's just enough setup to give room for the action scenes.  And while the characters may not be as nuanced as OCEAN'S ELEVEN or JACKIE BROWN, they're still memorable and sympathetic enough to add genuine weight to the faceoffs (as opposed to, say, XXX or SWORDFISH).2)SPOILERS:  Okay, here's the plot:  Once upon a time in Mexico, where everyone is out for themselves, and everyone uses everyone else, Agent Sands (Depp) is the king of the game.  He knows who wants to kill who, and sets them in a row to kill each other off and keeps things as they are.  The General kills the President, the Mariachi kills the General, the drug lord kills the Mariachi, the ex-Fed kills the drug lord, and everybody's happy and dead -- that's the plan. Of course, nothing goes as planned.Now, I could go on about the death and rebirth of the Sands character, and his parallels with Saul's trip to Damascus;  I could compare the arguments of redemption versus revenge as exemplified by Mr Good, Mr Bad, and Mr Ugly along with several ancillary characters;  I could even prattle about the satirical elements addressing the political situations of Central America... or I could just write Santa for an Agent Sands action figure.

164,bwkolbuck,This Movie is Crazy,7,8 October 2019,"This movie is insane. I don't know why I love this film so much. It's a comedy, drama, action, adventure, crime, western, romance and I love it! Honestly I would give this film a 10/10 but I try to keep my reviews fair.So let's go over the good things first because there's a lot. All the performances are very convincing considering the tone and goof setting they are placed in. Almost every character has a comedic moment. No one ever underplays it to the point of boredom but no one overplays to the point where it's annoying. It's a convincing action movie and a convincing comedy. There are memorable jokes and funny lines. everyone has a funny line but, in terms of comedy Johnny Depp steals the show. The action is awesome. It's over the top and intense and I love it. In terms of action Antonio steals the show. (Or as I like to call him Mexican John Wick). There is crazy !@#%$ going on every 10 minutes or so. Johnny Depp has a fake arm and shoots people with his real arm, Johnny Depp likes the pork he's eating and shoots the cook that made it for no reason, there's flamethrower guitars, gun guitars. a guy gets shot by 3 double barrel shotguns at once and flies back, Johnny Depp looses his eyes and there's blood pouring out, There's a flipping war during the third act, Johnny Depp tells a 10 year old boy to F off and so much more, it was so epic. The setting, costume design etc. There isn't much to say other than the fact that the costume design and makeup (especially for Johnny Depp's eyes) is fantastic. The set design and scale of the city is great. The drama aspect is competent but nothing out of the ordinary.Let's get into bad things now. While this film succeeds at the comedy and action aspects it doesn't excel as much with the drama aspect. The story (which is the drama part) that is holding this movie together isn't as good as it could have been. The plot is unnecessarily complicated. So many people die and come back to life. And Mickey Rourke has this whole subplot where he's american and he wants to leave Mexico and team up with the FBI agent. The cop girl is the daughter of Willem Dafoe for no reason. and another problem I have with this movie is that there are too many characters. This kind of falls into the drama aspect. If you want to make a good drama you have to develop the characters and their relationships for you to care about them and the story. Once Upon a Time in Mexico fails at this. For Example: Johnny Depp is dating this police officer lady (who is the daughter of Willem Dafoe) and we only see one scene of them talking and that's it. Or how the retired FBI agent says that the Willem Dafoe killed his partner, but we never see his partner so we don't care. It gets to the point where the writer doesn't know what to do with all these people so most of them just die at the end of the movie. Also since there are so many characters this results in a lot of one note stereotypes like; the guy who drinks a lot, the independent woman and evil villian #456.Overall I really had a fun time watching this. I would highly recommend this film. I can't wait to see it in the future. It succeeds at mostly everything it's trying to do. It's funny, action packed and has great performances, cinematography, set design, direction, competent script and so on. As of now I give Once Upon a Time in Mexico a 7/10 but I could see it going up to an 8 or down to a 6. Really great movie.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

Not really worth seeing unless you are a die hard Rodriguez/El Mariachi fan and need some closure on the story - but if you are, like me, then you've probably already seen it and came to roundabout the same conclusion - its a nice film, but has none of the kick-up-the-arse attitude that the first two have.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

If I had to point my finger at one aspect of the movie that ruined it, it had to be the editing. I'm sure the special edition DVD (released 2 months after the regular edition) will show the deleted scenes that would have made the movie flow.  I also had no connection with the characters. The only character I even remotely liked was Depp's. Problem is, you shouldn't like him. And, what is up with Iglesias? What's he doing in this movie? Somebody lose a bet? Wait for the DVD release and rent it. Don't pay full price.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

A corrupt CIA agent offers him a deal he can't turn away : revenge.
It works now and then, but too often it's too confusing and too many links and scenes that in my opinion could have been deleted and just left out.
It's an OK movie if you have nothing better to do a friday night, but to call this the sequel to Desperado is just taking it TOO far.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
170,mykungfuistrong,"Not a typical action movie, more of a political + cultural statement.",7,15 September 2003,"Bizarre.  Convoluted.  Epic.  Once Upon a Time in Mexico (OUTM) is a strange bird.  I will tell you right off the bat not to think of it as a follow up to Desperado or El Mariachi.  This is a very different film.  If taken on its own, you may be pleasantly surprised, but if you want `Desperado 2' then you're in for a letdown. THIS REVIEW CONTAINS POTENTIAL PLOT SPOILERS!!!!!! In 1992, Rodriguez makes El Mariachi on a shoestring budget and wows the indie film industry with his directing promise and prowess.  The story revolves around a guitarista who is mistaken for an assassin who carries his guns in a guitar case.  He spends all movie running away from the Mexican mafia until he is eventually forced to become the killer they think he is. In '95 Rodriguez followed it up with Desperado, his big budget remake. Technically, the story is a sequel, but the plot is basically the same. El Mariachi has come to town, looking for the men who were responsible for his fate in El Mariachi (his love was killed and his hand was shot, ensuring he'll never play as well as he used to).  He has inherited the mantle that comes with the guitar case, and people in this town fear this urban folktale.  It doesn't take long before he's embroiled in an all-out-war with the local mafia and has gotten mixed up with the head gangster's girlfriend (again). In OUTM, we pick up several years after the events of Desperado.  It incorporates a little revision into the story.  Carolina's boyfriend was now military instead of mafia, and he wasn't actually killed but survived to come and wreck his vengeance.  El Mariachi and Carolina run and run until they think they are finally safe, but then the military ex, Marquez, drives up with soldiers and shoots them and their young daughter.  This is all told in flashback over the course of the movie, so realize that at the beginning of the movie Salma Hayek's character is dead.  This leaves a broken-hearted Mariachi in seclusion in a small village, having somehow survived Marquez' attack.  Johnny Depp plays Sands, a CIA operative looking to exploit the current political situation in Mexico to his own gain.  But he needs a reliable hitman not connected to him for part of his scheme and finds out about El Mariachi through Belini (Cheech Marin), a bartender who survived one of El's previous rampages, albeit less one eye.  So Sands forcibly recruits El and points him in Marquez' direction, leading El to track down some of his guitarista buddies and retrieve the fabled guitar case.  This is just the beginning of a complex story involving a plethora of characters, all with their own motivations and designs, and before the movie is over we'll get to see whether they all get what they want or end up victims of the other characters' machinations. This movie is Rodriguez' baby.  He was writer, director, cinematographer, composer, editor, producer, visual effects supervisor, production designer, and camera operator.  Over the years you see him working with the same actors again and again (Banderas, Hayek, Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo, etc.) and taking more creative control.  Eight years after Desperado, and eleven years after El Mariachi, he's still perfecting his original idea.  Each time the result has been a richer and more complicated movie, but he might've taken it too far this time.  As I said before, the story is extremely complicated with more twists, turns, and double-crosses than an episode of Passions.  That's a far cry from the violent simplicity of the previous two efforts in this series.  On the one hand, all the characters are believable in their own right.  On the other hand, when you put it all together it seems a bit over the top and it takes the focus away from the `main' character that everybody is interested in.  The acting is top notch, and it's great to see a cast like this all with decently developed roles.  On the flip side of that, there may be too many characters for the average movie-goer to care about.  It is after all, an action movie, and the action is Bruckheimer-ed out to exaggerated proportions, but it's somehow not as satisfying as the focus of Desperado.  The overall feel of the movie is a bit mingled, with some scenes that play well but don't seem very connected to a main narrative; just as some shots are catchy and interesting but take attention away from the cohesiveness of the movie. In the end, Rodriguez has created a Mexican fairy tale, replete with a noble prince, a rebellious aristocracy, a simple everyman hero, and a couple wild cards to shake things up.  He shows us a vision of Mexico that is gritty and violent, where politics are ever-changing, and religion is constant but secondary to survival.  The humor is surprising and sometimes campy but seems to work.  The story is complex and unfocused but also works. The directing and composing are self-congratulatory but also.work.  OUTM is a unique blend of action, drama, horror, and comedy.  Rodriguez best work remains in the purity of Desperado, but those who can keep an open mind may find a rewarding experience in Once Upon a Time in Mexico.It's all in the details:  You may notice Tito Larriva as the cab driver Johnny Depp has to deal with.  Tito (from the band Los Lobos) has made a career out of movie cameos including Desperado and From Dusk 'Til Dawn.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

Granted it's more a collection of set-pieces and a showcase for a collection of cool/quirky characters than a coherent story, and Salma Hayek is criminally under-used, but i enjoyed every minute of it.Desperado was obviously a classic, and to be honest i was sceptical about whether bringing more big names on board would actually improve the sequel. But i have to say, Willem Dafoe, Mickey Rourke and Eva Mendes proved me wrong. However, this film really belongs to Jonny Depp, who is in inspired form, and delivers one of the funniest performances i have ever seen.This isn't a film that will make you think, or that you will even remember much about, but it's definitely a fun way to kill a couple of hours.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

Actually it is less a film than a kind of a video docudrama about a film, the kind you get as an extra when you buy a DVD. Pesky details like lighting, editing, continuity, script, plot, story line can be overlooked if not  down right ignored. This has the feel and look of an on the spot creation. Kind of a shoot as you go, ""hey this would be cool"", ""now let's do this!"" etc. etc.exercise in video riffing. The ultra cheesy fake explosions, silencers on revolvers, complete lack of marksmanship by the badguys at point blank range etc. pale in comparison to the ""story"" or what passes for it. The first 10 minutes were fun and full of promise but it soon deteriorated into an incomprehensible jumble of ""characters"" and ""plot"" ""twists"". The editing and continuity were, ""bewildering"", to be kind.  It is great to shoot on location in a cool place, but this is little more than a low budget video jam with some very cool stars (that I'll bet are dismally disappointed with this product.)  To give this overly contrasty, jumbled piece of eye fluff 4 stars is utter fraud and does a great disservice to real 4 star films.

I figured I'd better watch it since I was already paying $7 for it. It may have just been that I was tired, but I could not follow `Once Upon a Time in Mexico' all at! Guns were shooting and bullets were flying, and there seemed to be no real point to it at all. What a horrible disappointment after seeing `Desperado' which happens to be a great movie!After 20 minutes of nonsense shooting, that wasn't even done well, I decided to take the movie back. I was tempted to use the DVD as a Frisbee while I was driving to return it, but unfortunately, I knew better.Do yourself a favor and don't waste a penny on `Once Upon a Time in Mexico'. if one of your friends has rented it, well, sit awhile and see what I'm talking about. this movie is a piece of crap, not intended for human consumption!",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

I am an action junkie, and in seeing this movie, I was not disappointed. The action is almost non-stop here at places, and the body count has to be in the 100s. Antonio Banderas is great for the women as El Mariachi, while guys like myself were entertained, albeit for a short while, by Salma Hayek. However, the biggest addition to this movie was Johnnie Depp, who plays quite possibly the most psychotic and amoral CIA Agent ever portrayed. He is funny and witty, while at the same time, volatile and dangerous, equally likely to help the government of Mexico, or to murder in cold blood a cook because the cook's dish was ""too good."" This, quite possibly, is the biggest downfall of this movie. Yes, there is a black-comedyesque aspect to a lot of violence nowadays, but shooting a chef for no reason other than the fact that the food was good? What about killing a waitress for- LITERALLY -no reason at all? This is not funny, just depraved and wicked. Nevertheless, were it not for these few indiscretions, this would rate even higher in my book. I realize that a 9 out of 10 is pushing it, but, damn, I like this movie a lot. A shoot out that levels a Catholic Church all the while leaving a nun unharmed, a wild car chase, a Revolution attempt in the Capital, complete with mime-like guys using guns, an intriguing storyline and characters, along with good eye candy in the cast-this movie has it all. Nevertheless, this movie is extremely violent, and should not be watched by anybody above 15, I would say.

I love and still love EL Mariache and Desperado, so when this came out I rushed out to see it and when the credits were over,I stared at the screen trying to figure out how the movie I just watched had nothing positive I could say about it.I loved the way desperado had lots of action, all edited to the awesome music score blasting in the background. but the music in this movie was awful and popular I had heard a lot of the songs in it, but bad music is the least of its several problems.20 main characters, what? The movie has so many pointless characters. None of the actors seems to have energy, they all look tired and know how bad this movie is. The plot is mush and needlessly confusing.Desperado was known for it's awesome shoot outs {mostley stolen from john woos the killer} but in this movie the shoot outs were short and boring. The beautiful cinematography from desperado is also gone and the movie is painfully anti-climactic. The characters are so under developed you don't care if they live or die. The sly dialog from desperado also gone replaced with simple, banal statements that actually state the opposite of what his character says in el mariache.I was completely disappointed. I love, repeat love desperado and this movie tries to ruin everything that made that movie great. Antonio banderezes plays his character with no enthusiasm. The movie also has a few spots where the camera is screwed up. The worst part is that it focuses on characters that have to do with nothing.

But, I cannot really Robert Rodriguez; he is a great entertainer and just simply an all around excellent director. I believe he directed OUATIM to what he was allowed to. The guns that were used in the film didn't even arrive until they were already half way into filming. They had a very short time limit an permit to film in the areas they did in Mexico. So, Rodriguez just made due with what he had...and, I think, with what he had, he did a pretty good job.The one thing that stood out in this movie was Johnny Depp's character ""Sands."" A smooth talking, clever, rogue CIA agent that carries this film on his shoulders from start to finish. If you are going to watch this movie just enjoy the fine performance that Mr. Depp once again puts up as he does with a lot of his films, even for the eight days he was on set. He stole the show, and made it all around worth watching.This movie had so much potential. I think that if Rodriguez would have had more time to extend and elaborate on the scenes and the plot line more comprehensible and utilize the great cast that he had - this would have been one of the top movies of 2003. But, unfortunately, he had to make due, which is sad. Because, a cast like this, a title like this, and a filming location like this - this movie COULD HAVE BEEN special.

Oddly enough I expect that's exactly what an opening scene is supposed to do. The idea that the stories he was telling about Mariachi, first name El, were exagerated and charicaturish made the movie that much more enjoyable. There wasn't a single character that wasn't over-the-top or at least played to the hilt, from the somberly sensual Mariachi, to the stoic and manly General, to the sweetly sadistic and paranoid CIA agent.I was entertained from one end of the film to another, mildly confused with some of the cheap editing, but quite willing to pass that off as an homage to the first film.An $18 movie if there ever was one.I just think that El should stop hanging around women.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
184,insano-1,Maybe if somebody read the script before shooting....,4,30 December 2003,"SOME SPOILERSWhen the idea for `Once Upon a Time in Mexico' first hit director Robert Rodriguez , it must have also been accompanied by the notion of making a movie with as much random garbage, useless subplots, and an over abundant amount of uninteresting, unnecessary characters possible.
Rodriguez, king of the over budgeted `B' movie, brings back his characters originally made famous in his 1992 indie classic `El Mariachi,' then made more famous in the 1995 `Desperado' for this third, and hopefully last chapter.
The story is about.well, I still don't even know what the story is about and I sat through the entire movie, never straying once (either to use the restroom, smoke a cigarette, or pound on the glass of the ticket booth to demand my money back).
The story (term used loosely) of `Once Upon a Time.' has so many central characters, it's not difficult to differ who's conning who sleeping with who recruiting who, it's completely impossible. It finally gets to the point that when the big violent finale happens, nobody cares who dies, gets their eyes prodded out or gets their face surgically removed, they just want the house lights to come back on and the credits to finally role.
While the film was shot beautifully on new, High Definition digital cameras, it still has that feeling where I handed my thirteen year old cousin a handy-cam, gave him a few bucks worth of fireworks and let him go at it with no direction on where to go.
`Once Upon a Time.' tries to evoke a strong sense of Mexican pride in the viewer, but with so much going on, the message gets lost in the mindless gunplay and radio controlled explosive guitars. If it's movies like this that are supposed to reflect the Mexican film way of life, it's no wonder why so many immigrants are trying to cross their way into America.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

193,possiblegod,El Mariachi goes out with a bang,8,3 November 2005,"When writing a review of this film you can't avoid Desperado and El Mariachi. The first 2 in the trilogy. El Mariachi was a landmark in cinema history, shot in Mexican for $7000 by a man who sold his body to science to produce it. Rodriquez, the man in question, has certainly come a long way since. He is the man behind Spy Kids and Sin City and in the sequel to El Mariachi he had Antonia Banderas now playing El. While Desperado was a straight follow up from the first in the trilogy, El is taking out the gang responsible for being shot in the hand, this is very different. Once Upon A Time In Mexico is more of a fourth film, a sequel to a 3rd one that doesn't exist (and I for one wish had been made). The excellent Carolina from Desperado and the love of El's life is dead, and we see in flashbacks how. This annoyed me as the flashbacks show a Carolina who had learnt to fight, perhaps even better than El. I wanted to see more of her. OUATIM throws you in the deep end, El has a new enemy a vicious general and he has since learnt to play the guitar again. Yet somehow you eventually get over this. The characters are far more interesting, and thus the plot more complicated. The ever amazing Johnny Depp plays, aside from Jack Sparrow and Ed Scissorhands, his best role yet mentally unbalanced Agent Sands. Who although is a villain, he is a villain you want to triumph. Willem Defoe turns up as well as a gang leader, who I saw as a pointless character. The plot revolves around El being hired to kill Defoe and his general friend after a coup d'etat arranged by Sands who is also the man who has hired El to kill Defoe and the general, while El wants to save the president. This leads to an amazing finale full of explosions and machine gun firing guitars. If you haven't kept up so far, I guarantee you'll still Love it. Especially when El rushes in, with his standard 2 goofy assistants (Who actually live in this one) and the president stands in shock. President: Who are you? El replies: Sons of Mexico sir. Before blasting the enemy. With classic lines, classic characters the only problem is it is very different from the previous 2 in the trilogy.

194,marcelik,Wait For The End!!,7,10 December 2005,"Once Upon A Time In Mexico is good, but not as strong as Desperado. Our hero, El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) barely has any lines. Throughout the movie we forget this talented actor is the star of the movie. The explosive action is incredible, and including Sands (Johnny Depp) is the only thing worth raving about. Depp's role is actually the best part of this movie. Salma Hayek's role has been chopped to flashbacks, so there is not a lot of crazy Action and Romance between Banderas and her. You want Antonio Banderas to save the day and he does, but this Sequel did not give him that fire. Eva Mendes is in about 4 scenes but does a great job including the rest of the cast (Ruben Blades, Cheech Marin, Mickey Rourke, Willem Dafoe, and Enrique Iglesias). It would have been nice to hear some hot new songs from Enrique Iglesias for the soundtrack but I am more than satisfied with Salma Hayek's ""Siente Mi Amor"". It is an incredible Spanish track, worth watching the entire credits!",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

196,Fugitive_at_imdb,FANTASTIC Ending to the Trilogy- Rodriguez' Best Yet,10,28 September 2003,"I know why some of you are posting harsh reviews...§§SPOILER WARNING!!§§*****DO NOT READ the first two paragraphs if you haven't seen it!!!*************** Yes, we have another sad ending.  And it's odd to have that after Part 2's happy ending canceled off the sad one for Part 1.  But you have to understand- sometimes powerful films have powerful endings.  Antonio's character could not truly let go of his life of vengeance if he wasn't tested.  When we see him walk away at the end, leaving behind his title for another man to take over (Johnny Depp), we KNOW he's really gone for good, because he has every reason in the world to continue killing drug lords, but he chooses a return to the guitar.  After all, he is El Mariachi.The legend of the larger-than-life assassin traveling from town to town, performing miracles of death against his enemies and the enemies of Mexico, will go on.  Agent Sands has a new life now- and frankly. he's more equipped for the job.**********Now, for the rest of you- especially if you're big fans of the trilogy so far- get ready for the final chapter.  But be ready: Rodriguez WILL end it. He covers what is necessary both for the man and the legend that is El Mariachi.  They stand amidst a battle on a much larger scale this time. They are small players in it and yet the most important ones.  You'll see what I mean.For anyone who sees this film and doesn't understand how it ties the trilogy together, feel free to email me and I'll explain.  I'm happy to talk with nay-sayers, too, but trust me- this trilogy is in the bag.  Buy the three-movie package once it comes out and you'll have one of the few trilogies in the world that really worked.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
197,ricoda-1,TOO MUCH!!!!,5,14 March 2004,"Where can I start with this movie. Well first of all, the plot outline. In this movie there is way too much going on, revenge is the only thing we hear about. The only goal that isn't about revenge is that of Johnny Depp's. Which by the way gave the only good acting, I mean Willem Dafoe was practically dipped in chocolate to look like he did. I believe that the story could have been much better about a Mexican revolution and Johnny Depp trying to get the money. Instead, they put Inspector Gadget on steroids by having guns and bombs everywhere. Because I liked the main goal of the movie, getting the money when the government and guerilla are fighting, I give this movie a 5 out of 10 (very generous).",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
198,syphon103,"Worth watching, but only cos of Depp.",6,3 January 2006,"This is and o.k film. I think it received a lot of attention mainly due to the fact that it flashes the ""We've got Johnny Depp"" card about the place.Now that fact causes a plus and a minus. The plus is that he kind of makes the film in my opinion, without him it would be mediocre at best, unlike it's predecessor Desperado (also 'El Mariarchi'). The minus side is that he's very much a side character, and ends up being a fundamentally nonsensical one (but nevertheless all the more amusing for it!).Other than Depp, the film does have it's amusing parts and it's explosive parts, but neither are surprising or original. One thing that I did really appreciate about Once Upon a Time In Mexico is the atmosphere it creates, with Mariarchi wistfully strumming his guitar even during being shot at.Overall - worth a watch for Depp, but not Rodriguez at his best.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
199,ENRIQUE-3,A total fiasco! INTOLERABLE!,1,22 September 2003,"With his first effort ""El Mariachi,"" Rodriguez emerged as an interesting, audacious young director. When Hollywood considered him marketable and gave him lots of money, he made a big disappointment: ""Desperado."" ""From Dust to Dawn"" was even worse. It seemed that Rodriguez had nothing to offer except mediocre, derivative recycling of all kinds of Hollywood cliches. Rodriguez was having his own trip, finally been able to reproduce all the trash he saw in commercial mainstream productions. Guitars transforming in machine guns were fun the first time, but like a child, he repeated the same joke over and over again, making everybody upset. We felt like tell him: ""Enough, Bobby Rodriguez! It is not fun anymore! Quit!."" ""The Faculty"" recorded a new low on his career. I refused to see the ""Spy Kid"" trilogy, but I went to see this last one because of the impressive cast and for all the hype built around it. Well, it was a painful and embarrassing experience to realize that Rodriguez has neither talent nor intelligence whatsoever. Even worse, he shows total ignorance about his own culture, western tradition, and cinema in general. He has nothing to offer: deep on his mind there is a total vacuum. Some people defend this flick arguing that he intended a parody. Well I know a lot of parody and intertextuality: this flick was just processing left over food that had been recycled, reheated and your stomach may not be able to process. Rodriguez should go directly to TV commercials (Pepsi, ChiChi's or Taco Bell): he would do right on that area. The only redeemable thing in this flick was Johnny Depp's performance. The rest should go right to the trash can. ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" is one of the biggest bombastic fiascos we have witnessed during the last years. Everything is total clumsiness and stupidity from beginning to end. Much worse than other BOMBS like ""Gigli,"" this moronic product is a serious contender for worst movie ever.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
200,schnofel,Is Rodriguez really such a bad director?,3,25 October 2003,"I'm really curious whether or not anyone can make sense of this mess. I know that Rodriguez has achieved a certain cult status in the 90s. And I'm the first one to admit that EL MARIACHI and DESPERADO are fun; flicks that I revisited again and again as a teenager.But the 3rd part of this trilogy feels like yesterday's news. I don't know what this movie is about, if it takes itself serious or not (probably not, but then it'd have to be much funnier) and why so many fabulous actors are wasted. Johnny Depp is the only reason to see this at all. Damn it, see it for him. He stands out in every scene he is in and gives his role pathos to cherish. His CIA agent/ killer/ renegade/ whatever he plays is the only new idea this movie has; the rest is inexplicable at best.Why do we get to see Salma Hayek only in ridiculous flashbacks? Why is Enrique Iglesias in more scenes than Willem Dafoe and Mickey Rourke? Why was this flick made when it didn't want to tell a story that would follow up on something that happened before or enhance the characters? Yeah, I know it's an ""action film"" in an exploitation genre, but a guitar that can fire bullets and flames and people jumping through the air is just not enough. And Antonio Banderas is making one bad movie after the other (just try to watch IMAGINING ARGENTINA and don't come out laughing.)And concerning the use of digital cameras: Especially in action scenes where there is a lot of movement, you can mistake the pictures easily for something that was shot on a regular DV camera. I see that you can work faster on digital cameras, but they are just not ready for the big screen. ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO wouldn't be a better film if it was shot on 35mm, but it would look like one.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

What I got was a plotless, ridiculous movie filled with ugly, sickeningly rendered comic book violence. Johnny Depp in particular is thoroughly wasted in his role, but not much more so than Antonio Banderas and Willem Dafoe. Flashbacks, dreams,internal fantasies,imaginings, and some of the most ludicrous firefights in movie history are interspersed here with only the barest attempt at narrative. Near the end, when Johnny Depp's character has been blinded but is still functional and seemingly hardly the worse for wear, the movie descends into something close to idiocy. A complete waste of time, money, and talent. I now understand why there were only about 10 people in the 200 seat theater in which I saw the movie.

I am also a bigRobert Rodriguez fan.  So when a third film was announced, I wasexcited.  However, after seeing it this past weekend, I have to say Iam disappointed.  The plot was convoluted.  El Mariachi's character was a supportingcharacter at best.  There were plenty of scenes that just made nosense whatsoever.  For instance, when Johnny Depp's eyes aregouged out, within twenty minutes he was able to aim a gun byhearing where the target was.  That's an awfully quick recovery. 
In addition, what was the deal with the shackles on Banderas andHayek?  Was I in the bathroom when they showed up in the film?Also, why was Danny Trejo in the film?  He was killed in the lastfilm!  Once Upon A Time In Mexico fell very short of its predecessors.  Ithad none of the rough edginess of El Mariachi.  It had none of thecool, slick style of Desperado.

204,Mikey_Walsh,Lacks the grit of its predecessors.,6,16 September 2003,"Once Upon A Time In Mexico was a confused Desperado which was grossly tainted by Rodriguez's zany Spy Kid antics.  While I think Johnny Depp is awesome to the max and love nearly all the films he has chosen to be in (due laregely to his preformances in each of them) unfortuneitly in this film however I think Depp's preformance set a slightly too comical feel that skewed the entire film.  Then again maybe this cucu-whacky feel of the film had nothing to do with Depp but rather with the script, direction and editing of the post Spy Kids Rodriguez. One thing I really did like about this movie was it contained all the senseless violence and bloody gore typical of a Van Damme flick.  This return to late 80's early 90's R rated action film was awesome, and like Rambo II, Commando, and Die Hard I'm sure this will be a movie that will be great in a couple years to watch with a buch of friends and laugh at how wrong it is.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

207,sixpackrt,"May be set in Mexico, but it's all over the place.",4,20 September 2003,"Being a big Robert Rodriguez fan, Once Upon A Time In Mexico was a big thing for me having been a return from his departure to work on the Spy Kids series (which had most of his fans scratching their heads). However, my excitement did fade a bit in waiting, so I can say that going into the theater I was not expecting anything more than what Rodriguez has shown us he can provide in the past. Not that there is anything wrong with wanting to take a series installment into new territory but Once Upon A Time In Mexico had me looking back on Desperado and El Mariachi and wanting more of the same.Rodriguez seems to want to pay homage to the great westerns yet veers from the base simplicity of those past milestones and throws everything in our faces, from political assasinations to complicated yet poorly thought-out doublecrossings. It builds up with such rapid incoherence that it's like the audience is having firecrackers thrown at them constantly. So constantly, in fact, that we loose the energy to piece it all together. Before half the movie is over, it's hard to care if the firecrackers go off. It would have been helpful if programs outlining the various characters and their intentions were handed out on the way into the theater.
Then there's the characters. And, boy, are there a lot of them. The problem is few of them are likable or even essential. Take for example, the Eva Mendes character who is thrown in only to give the Depp character trouble in a single scene later on. Or even Dafoe, a limitlessly-great actor, whose character here is so paper thin and one-dimensional that it is hard to believe what he saw in the script. Or any of the other big names here, for that matter. It's like a supergroup that just doesn't care. And I do not blame them. For as great as Depp is here as an actor, his character is so unlikable that any harm done to him is unaffecting. Thinking back, the only three likable characters I can find are the Mariachi, the President Of Mexcio and the ex-FBI agent. All three of these roles are played very, very well. But Rodriguez is too busy setting off firecrackers to show us even a few minutes of each. While in the other movies, the action centered around the Mariachi. Here, Banderas is wasted. Sure, he gets top billing. But he is standing in the shadows.Which would lead to the action scenes. Are they good? Yeah. But they go nowhere near touching on the poetic versitility of the shootouts in the previous films in the trilogy. Here, El Mariachi looks like he is running out of ways to jump in the air and shoot guns. The violence is nowhere near as slam-bang but a mean-hearted nature is prevalent here. More innocents are killed for no reason than in the past two films. Take for example a scene where a charcter, on his way out of a restaraunt, walks through the kitchen and shoots the chef. The scene comes off in such bad taste that we wonder what has happened to Rodriguez. I suspect the audience was supposed to laugh but it just does not suit the flavor of the series or even the film it's in. In a Tarantino film, it would have been dynamite hilarity. Here, it's tragic, needless violence.So what's good about the movie? Well, all things said, Once Upon A Time In Mexico is not a bad movie. Compare it to most action flicks out this year and it sure takes a prize trophy. But compared to it's predecessors and what we have seen Rodriguez do in the past, it falls far short of glory.In the end, I think the proper way to wrap the trilogy should have been another town, another barfight, another cute girl. But Once Upon A Time In Mexico tries to be such an epic that it turns out like if Martin Scorsese or Paul Thomas Anderson got together to do a mediocre action flick.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
208,dragonrelm,Half cooked story (Spoiler),5,15 September 2003,"After watching the trailers and then watching the movie.. I cannot say that I am thoroughly impressed with the movie as it was. Although the characters were will done it could have with some better lines. The story only went half way though each set and then picked up somewhere else. And the dream flash backs have been over done too many times. Although Depp and Banderas make a convincing movie, it lacked the follow through that the first movie did. The story takes too long to develop and by the time you actually get somewhere it gets boring. You already have figured out everything and there are no plot twists. Not to mention if you are going to list someone in the actual credits as a lead... then they better actually have some real time in the movie.. not as just a side note.Overall Action   9 / 10 Plot outline     4 / 10 Reason to go see the movie.. better to wait till video...

209,contact-89,quite a mess...,4,12 September 2003,"Contains SPOILERS.I was going to the theater with a positive attitude and not knowing much about the film by having only seen the full trailer once. It was enough to convince me. Damn, I was fooled...Mr. Rodriguez needs to get more than a script doctor because I've rarely seen such a badly written scenario. It goes all over the place while getting nowhere all through the film. Sub-plots with characters that have no purposes. Like many, Dafoe is one that you keep wondering what's his role in this and why the hell does he decides to get a change of face at one point near the 2/3 of the film. Johnny is fine but we never really get to understand again what's the reason the FBI is entangled in this situation, and even his character's text proves that his confusion is leading him in no specific direction. So he goes around hiring/convincing people to do this and that while being a happy-go-lucky guy who gratuitously (unfortunately not in the fun way) kills innocent extras. And by the time you don't really care anymore, he pulls a Daredevil like it was the easiest/painless thing in the world to become BLIND. Not to mention that the bad guys have good occasions to kill the heroes once and for all but would rather disabled them or put them in escapable situations...Hey, don't get me wrong, I ""like"" moronic bad guy decisions like in the James Bond movies, but in this one it's just to damn stupid to be taken on a that type of level.And if you ask me, alot of people will be disappointed by the misleading poster that lets you believe Antonio and Salma are the central characters of the film. When Antonio is there, he barely has the charisma of Desperado, and you get maybe a line or two by Salma who is dead from the beginning and only appears in flashbacks... That's not even a real spoiler because if you don't get that the first time she appears on screen, then you're in for a major deception. But I could care less because I wasn't expecting her to hold the film together.So basically, without enumerating the myriads of useless ploys and murders, all I can say is that the film is about Johnny trying to pull some sort of money stunt that blends all sorts of bad guys and good ones into saving the Mexican president from a coup d'état and convincing Antonio to now be a real hero for his government instead of the ""legend"" that he had become.Note that I'm not aware of the current political situation in Mexico, so I don't know on which angle to deal with this, but one thing for sure is that Robert Rodriguez has made sure we are still confused why everyone is fighting everyone, even up to masked paraders on the occasion of the Day of Dead festivities... A real big gunfight ensues that leaves absolutely no cadavers after the bloodbath.I'm just realizing now that there are so many more flaws, more than I'm interested in writing about...In the end, it's way far less entertaining than Desperado, not suspenseful for a second, because all the actions scenes have no build-up whatsoever, and happen just because a regular spectator would feel it would be a good time to put some bloody eye candy on the screen. The directing is not well choreographed, it really feels like Robert was on auto-pilot.But I must say that I wasn't disappointed by one thing, the HD look is really not bad at all, I think it looks pretty slick aside from very few minor glitches. I'm certain that 97% of the population will never see the difference. Well done on that side. But even though I like better actual celluloid, I must say that I'm not one of the purist and am always open to new technologies.---------Wait for it on TV....contact-89",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

As a Fan of Robert Rodriguez and as a ""El Mariachi"" and ""Desperado"" enthusiast, my opinion of this movie is ultra low. Here's a list of things that were lame:1. Gunbattles: Horribly Choreographed and utterly boring. They seem to just happen and as opposed to the prequels (if you will) my disbelief could not be suspended, and after the gunbattles ended i just sat there with a big ""year right"" on my face. Both ""El Mariachi"" and ""Desperado"" amazed me with its action, but somehow Rodriguez managed to make the thing that could've made the movie great, into the most boring aspect of the film.2. Story: Granted, the story of the previous two weren't the most innovative either, but this one tried too hard to have twists and turns, and it never went anywhere. It tried too hard to be something its not. Instead he should have tried to work on a story that is simple, coherent and kind of interesting, instead of an incoherent mess, which had 4 storylines run parallel, and none of them were pleasantly followable. one giant disaster3. Is this movie about Antonio or Johnny Depp? coz Johnny seemed to appear a lot more in this one than Antonio, and honestly, the only thing that made the movie worth watching was Johnny Depp. Everybody else was boring and had nothing to offer.4. As opposed to the previous two, this one was insanely looooong, and had nothing to offer for it. Sometimes, when a movie is this very long, it might get to me, but some of those long movies have at least something to show for it, or atleast a reason why it was so long. This one offered nothing and I'm not giving anything back.My only pro about this movie is its Cinematography, or shall I say Videography. Best shot Video i've ever seen. Only rarely did I see that it was video, but any other time, it looked very convincingly like film. Only Star Wars did better, but Lucas works with an insane budget, compared to Rodriguez.Final Word: ""El Mariachi"" and ""Desperado"" were both cool and quite entertaining. My expectations were no more than that for ""O.U.A.T.I.M."" But it couldn't even fulfill that.I never judged RR for doing Spy Kids, but I will judge him on this one: I am utterly disappointed!

It was only during the second viewing that I found the story and much of the strange beauty of this movie.  There was a delicious dichotomy to the film: the hot revenge driven Banderas and the cool, detached, manipulative Depp.  By the end of the film, each had been altered irrevocably and the story had arched into legend.This film neither seeks, nor wants the approval of  everybody, as some of the whining reviews here would prove.  You either 'get it' or you don't. Its as simple as that.  If this film hasn't hooked you  by about 20 minutes into it, you're not going to enjoy it.

The current state of Hollywood action flicks is pretty sad, as they have given up realism for sensationalism. In one scene, Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek awoke from bed only to find two baddies drawing a bead on them from street level with automatic weapons. In the shootout in which it seems hundreds of rounds were fired, and Banderas and Hayek were slow in fleeing the scene, not once were they even nicked with a bullet. It seems like the bad guys in this movie were all terrible shots and only the 'good' guys had keen marksmanship. And I lost count on how many rounds were spent from Banderas' two-shot sawed off shotgun before he re-loaded. Gimme a break. I understand a little 'suspension of belief' in movies, but this was too much. And Banderas, to me, is no actor. Who made him so??? The best part of this film? Any scene with Salma Hayek in it.

Almost as if their time has come and gone. Which can sometimes be the story if the timing is right.My nostalgia for seeing these characters return does, however, overtake that best-before concern, and the addition of new characters like Depp's certainly helps stretch the stew, so to speak.I wish this movie had come out sooner; hot on the heels of Desperado would have made this feel more of its time.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

222,AaronBrungardt,How do you say convoluted in Spanish?,4,28 February 2004,"I don't know, but I know how you say it in English: Once Upon a Time in Mexico.  Don't get me wrong I like Robert Rodriguez (exception of Spy Kids: Uno, Dos, Tres) but this movie tried to do WAY too much.  There are way too many unique characters to follow and too many stories going on at the same time.  I can usually follow complicated plots in most films but this one made my head spin, in a bad way.  On the positive side it is beautifully shot and has pretty much sold me on films in High Def.  The real stand-out performance in this movie goes to Ruben Blades and unfortunately not to Johnny Depp.  Willem Dafoe also does a good job of making us believe he's not white, but barely.  I think this movie pales in comparison to Desperado and El Mariachi in most ways except visual effects.  I would call this a good effort if it weren't for the fact that it's the third film in a quasi-trilogy and the director is neither a first-timer nor a poor man's Tarantino.  Rodriguez is capable of better and has shown it more than once before, even in extemely low-budget films like El Mariachi.   **** out of 10.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

It is action packed with loads of twists that will keep the average movie lover happy but alot of people in the cinema didn't like it cause they found it too gory and complicated. The only draw back of this film was that two guys that initially died in desperado were used in this sequel and given different identities.I personally liked this film alot as it has it all - great cast, good acting, loads of action, thriller and some good jokes.

There is a laugh or two, but that can't save this train wreck.Walk down the street, with pistols, killing dozens of men with automatic weapons.  It's been done before, but never so recklessly and continually. It happens in bars, motorcycles, churches, every ten minutes.   Late in the film with Depp visually impaired, shooting at the enemy, I just about screamed it was so foolish.I felt like I was being slapped in the face.  Do they think the audience is really that stupid.   I knew this would be an over the top film, like Desperado, but this is virtually without merit.Scenery is well filmed, great cast with little to say or do, worthless script, cliched revenge story.This film is an insult to your intelligence as a viewer.  Those responsible should be banned from making films (not really, but it is bad).
I understand the idea of exaggerating the story.  Yes it is a movie, but I can't believe that this is so pathetically ridiculous.If you want ridiculous shootouts, go see Commando.   It's pathetic too, but at least you don't feel like they tried to make something believable.Depp and Dafoe must have been paid a pretty penny for this waste of celluloid.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
229,MrMovieMan3485,An OK movie.,6,21 December 2004,"This movie was OK. I thought Desperado was much better and not just because Salma Hayek was actually in this movie. I find it strange that Salma Hayek gets second billing in OUTIM yet she is barely in the movie but only for a few sequences of El's memory. I think this had something to do with Hayek's busy schedule while filming Frida. All in all, El is back for more action. Johnny Depp plays the role of an FBI agent. He was fairly entertaining. With regret I say that this is not a very good sequel. I found myself at times looking at the time display on my DVD player to see how much longer I must watch it. That's always a bad sign. I recommend this movie to those who want to see what happens to El after Desperado. This movie, for me, was of an informative movie. I give it a 6/10, just because it was a sequel to the great movie Desperado.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

I'm amazed and shocked that Depp agreed to do this role, i know he likes to take some odd roles, but this is just insane.If the movie was billed as a comedy, it would have achieved it's purpose perfectly, but to class it as a thriller?

Although I must admit that some of them should have been given bigger parts or else have been left out altogether.I did enjoy watching this movie but it doesn't make sense the first time around...there is so much going on that the audience often feels as if trying to figure everything out will cause their brains to overheat. up are still a definite factor, however, As Johnny Depp lends his style and talents to the character of corrupt C.I.A agent, Sheldon Jeffrey Sands(he even came up with the 'sheldon Jeffrey' part of the name) even though the part was originally written for Quentin Tarantino. And praise is much deserved of Enrique Iglesias who plays the opinionated but still very loyal Lorenzoand also Eva Mendes who plays Agent Ajedrez with edge and darkness.This film is very much one for people who are fans of explosions and action but not for those who like well-written plots.

232,Gerrit-KvdH,"Femme Fatale : Eva Mendes, Movie : Good but not Great!",6,24 September 2005,"My Overall view after watching this moving was 2 things : One : The Perfect ""Femme Fatale"" in Eva Mendes.Two : Antonio Banderas played his role well but the overall movie was, worth a 6.0 or 5.8 points rating.As for Miss. Mendes i recommend a second part of the film ""Cat Women"", I'd like Halle Berry Or Jessica Alba to play the ""Top-Role"" in the Movie.With Mendes as her Enemy and with Ex-Odyssey 5 Star Leslie Silva Or Rosario Dawson as Sidekick to the ""Evil"" Miss Mendes.But that for later i was just impressed by her well let's say ""Striking"" Way to Outfox Johnny Depp.Although in the end she got what she deserved, she impressed me.Depp himself played a very good role, setting every body against themselves and running the show, but like i said Mendes outfoxed him.As for The Hole Movie, The Role Antonio Banderas played was good, he took revenge for the death of his Wife (Salma Hayek).Enrique Iglesias, did OK but i'm not sure whether he should be an actor.Here's my take on the movie :The evil Barillo and General Marquez try to take over Mexico, and are helped by the military. Barillo's tactical brilliance made his daughter (Eva Mendes) enter the army, and threw that she could help him, control the army, Mendes ho is using Johnny Depp to get her classified information finds out that he is trying to use her for a scam that will bring Depp a few million dollars! Mendes capture's him and because of Depp saw that Barillo (Ho everybody thought was dead)was alive, Depp's eyes were taken out, Depp seems no treat anymore.. but we all know how that finished!(The Ones ho watched the movie)Agent Jorge FBI, goes undercover to try and get the truth behind what's going on in the ""MOB-Bussiness"", he teams up with ex-Mafia Mickey Rourke, ho is wanted in the US, Jorge know's that and uses Rourke's desire to get back the US, to find out more about Barillo and General Marquez's plans, he asks for Rourke's help because Barillo killed Jorge's best friend and Rourke agrees. In the end Jorge get's to deep and finds Barillo's body on a plastic surgery table completely covered with blood! Jorge tries to get out of the Hospital as soon as he can, but is stunned when he sees Barillo in front of him ""Alive"" in the steps. Agent Jorge then gets Knocked out by Barillo's daughter : Eva Mendes.As the popularity of ""El Presidente"" seems to be dropping his ""adviser"" advises him to stay as much as he can in the presidential palace leaving the president thinking that the people of Mexico are trying to kill him!The President questions the loyalty of his people, but in the end finds out that they are the only ones he can trust!In the end Antonio Banderas shot General Marquez for brutally killing his wife (Salma Hayek) ho was pregnant, Hayek had a relationship with Marquez but then shot him in the head, Marquez didn't die and swore revenge. Helped by Enrique Iglesias, Banderas gets his revenge on Marquez.Agent Jorge gets a showdown with Barillo, the man ho shot Jorge's best Friend and takes revenge.In the end it seems like a movie about the ""Mexican Liberation"" with the main thing the plotting of a ""Coe d'etat"".But overall i wasn't overly impressed as i have seen movie's about, Mexican Leberations before!

Full of fantastic fights and invigorating violence. A great story line and a funny character provided by Sands (Johnny Depp.) A re memorable performance from Antonio Banderas as a mysterious killer in the depths of Mexico. Full of action and humour, contains very little romance but some emotional drama.This film, i felt, was one of Johnny Depp's quality performances. He has a great sense of humour in this and turns this film from being a serious Mexican action, into a funny stunt full piece of work.With incredible directing from Robert Rodriguez, who is known for his amazing directing on Desperadose, this is a film to not be forgotten.

235,cheesaburger,This movie rocked,8,11 August 2006,I thought this movie was great. Though Antonio Banderas was supposed to be the main man of the show Johnny Depp really stole the show. His performance as Sands was great. His great one liners infused with a short swear words combat the hero of one liners Arnold Shwartznegger and considering Depp is considerably better looking i think he won. Other than Johnny Depp the movie still was pretty spectacular - the film techniques were interesting particularly in the scene where Sands shoots the cook and blood is flecked across the screen. The music really sets the scene of Mexico and is just real catchy. The serious side of the movie in reference to its predecessors does give it some depth. The whole losing of eyes thing was a bit disturbing but the way Sands handled it just made it another comedic add on to this already funny movie.

I like the director's style---everything is exaggerated, but it works.  Johnny Depp is very easy on the eyes as well as funny in this movie (the fake arms were great!)...I didn't quite buy Willem Dafoe as the bad guy, though.

The Mariachi saga is an intriguing franchise, but in my opinion, it should have ended with Desperado, which was good indeed. But in this crappy movie, there was no plot; it reduced El Mariachi to almost a completely secondary character; killed off the exotic beauty--Salma Hayek--for absolutely no reason; and DO NOT be fooled by Johnny Depp's presence here--as good as an actor he may be, his character in this movie is absolutely annoying and insignificant. What's more, the storyline in this movie has absolutely no relevance to the Mariachi character. In my opinion, this was just some poor excuse for Mr. Rodriguez to make a second sequel, probably because the guy was running out of ideas. Those of you who are thinking or considering seeing it, DON'T!!! It will be an absolute waste of your time and money. That'll be 2 hours of your lives that you will never get back.

I find the three mariachi movies pretty offensive to my Mexican culture and my country. Although I praise his ability and how original his scripts are. The problem I have is certain elements like the music, which is more Flamenco than actual Mexican. Also our country is not that type of place as depicted in all three movies, you can't generalize the whole country because of what some border towns look like. This movie isn't as good as the critics have panned it out to be. I like how cartoony the characters may be; but in reality it grows tired after only 30 min. of movie, which actually happens to all of his movies with the exception of Sin City, which in my opinion was more of a Frank Miller acomplishment than his but the movie still rocked though. Believe it or not I actually found it funny and interesting seeing how he managed to blend three different Mexican cities, which actually were only chosen because of their rustic fasad. I actually live in Queretaro where he shot the hospital scene and a scene I believ was in the downtown part. Even though that cafe doesn't face a hospital but a wall.Having said this I think that Rodriguez should stick to what he knows best which are comics, B movies, stupid kids movies and suck horror flicks.

They were not talked about in Desperado.I enjoyed Johnny Depp's ""sarcastic"" character. But, I also think Johnny Depp's repeat of the word ""Savvy"" should be used ONLY for the ""Pirates of the Caribbean.""I think Antonio Banderas, Johnny Depp and Enrique Iglesias are too good looking for them to have been wasted on a movie so poorly put together.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

I never understood the relationship with Depp and the Commanders daughter?? There was just too much going on and not enough explanation of what linked what to what. Yeah, Depp's character was a jerk in the film, yes he deserved to be messed up, but his eyes??!! Whoa, talk about your ""freaky torture scene""! I guess it was because they showed it till the last possible second, then left it to your imagination, (which made it about a bazillion times worse), so, I guess they achieved the ""gross-out"" effect. I'm such a tremendous J.Depp fan, that it really left me with an icky feeling! Agent Sands did have some feelings, when he was about to shoot it out with the two goons in front of the building, and he told the little boy to run away, ""I don't hear you running"", at least we knew he wasn't a total ""peanut-head""! But, as far as the rest of the story, I just couldn't get into it. I'm glad I saw it in the theatre, but, I will not be renting the dvd. The background scenes were the best part of the movie, and they did portray a fairly accurate ""Day of the Dead"". But, all in all, I give this movie a disappointing ""5""!

Despite this slight detail, i still found the film enjoyable and entertaining, with enough wit/sly humour and action sequences to keep the pace through out the story.  The characters remain interesting, from Dafoe's Barillo to Antonio's infamous El Mariachi.  However, despite the focus of El Mariachi's character (with him as the basis, like of the previous two films), it is Johnny Depp that acts as the glue to the film, holding it together.  His character Agent Sands is devious, humorous, clever, witty and unique and keeps the audience clued in by discussing the story between other characters.Depp certainly won't harm his acting career with this film, and with Pirates of the Caribbean in toll as his other big movie of the moment, his celebrity status is sure to rise.

Even though Hayek is not in the movie long she is still beautiful and you cannot take your eyes off of her. Johnny Depp lives up to his to his Pirate of the Caribbean movie with another breathtaking performance as Agent Sands and Antonio Bandaras continues where he left off from desperado with his chilling performance. The music for the movie is well done and the fact that it is on digital camara makes the movie worthwhile.

Johnny Depp is the only reason to see this movie.  It's really surprising that he even chose to star in it. The only reason I can see, is that he was able to have his eyes gouged out, and Johnny loves to make himself as least attractive as possible.  The fight scenes were so unrealistic it hurt.

Since Rodriguez is in charge of just about everything of interest here, I have to assume that he meant it to be this bad.  There's every single bit of current attention-deficit disorder style here - incessant intercutting, no story, no characterization, twelve billion flashbacks - you know the lot.  It's funny when it's not supposed to be, but the setup laughs are so incredibly juvenile that you'd have to be high to find it humorous.

As usual, Rodriguez takes artistic liberties with physics, as people sail through the air from small-caliber weapons, but it's all in good fun, and holds to the story's theme of being a potentially exaggerated Mexican Legend.Banderas really nails the role of El Mariachi, bringing power and likeability to what is really the role of a cold-blooded killer. Depp weaves another unique and unusual character in Sands. Even the secondary characters are well written, well acted, and interesting.The plot gets a bit muddled at points, and I look forward to the DVD to see what scenes might have been cut that would have done a more thorough job of explaining, but by the end of the film you can piece things together easily enough.While there may not be an Oscar hidden in this film, it's a far better way to spend a few hours than many films I've seen recently.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

I also didn't see the need for the sadistic portions -- they didn't add one thing to the movie for me.

I loved all the scenes of Mexico.  And I loved the ending. Banderas walks off into the sunset the solitary hero wearing part of the Mexican president's uniform with the Mexican flag's colors. He holds it up to his face and kisses it, showing his efforts in thwarting Depp's evil plot were motivated out of love for his country too, and not just revenge against the drug lord.

253,bagso,Great Conclusion,9,15 December 2003,"This has taken nearly 10 years to follow the 'heavy on action', 'light on story' ""Desperado"", and the 'heavy on substance', 'light on budget' ""El Mariachi"". Was it worth the wait? Yes and NoFirst all the positives- It is a very good movie. It succeeds where people say Desperado suffered- story. This movie has a great story of intertwining plot lines, and the characters that filled them. Johnny Depp's 'Agent Sands' must surely be one of the great film characters of the last 10 years. The rest of the cast are also solid (even Enrique!), with Ruben Blades being the next best to Depp.It is very well paced. There are no slow bits, and there is always an action scene of a plot development to keep you interested. This is also where El Mariachi failed. Mariachi had the old mistaken idea story that we've seen countless times, but was just shot in such a way that made it original (camera angles, editing, and pacing of scenes). Not OUATIM. Not only are there plot twists, but characters develop, and are not always as they first seem to be.The running time is only 100 mins. Rare these days, especially when the movie is an epic conclusion to a trilogy. But it's refreshing to know that a director is not so far up himself to think that a movie has to go for 150+ mins to be great. 100 mins is actually my preferred running time. It means that you can buy a large coke, watch it, and not have to worry about running off to the gents as they approach the climax.But to completely contradict myself, I must say this movie could have been assisted by an extra 20 mins. With the exception of Banderas and Hayek's characters, the rest were all new. It could have assisted to have some back story on them (Depp does have a small scene with Blades that provides some insight into his character). Yet the character we get some back story on, is the Mariachi. Basically the only one we already knew!But apart from this, there aren't too many problems with it. Why would I suggest that it wasn't worth the wait? Firstly, the length of time it took to be released (still not released in Australia until Feb '04!). Secondly, some Desperado fans will be disappointed. Some people highlight the frenetic shoot-outs as their main reason for liking Desperado. The ones in OUATIM come nowhere near those. However, they completely exceed the ones in Mariachi.To some it up, OUATIM will eventually be seen as the superior film of the trilogy, but on first viewing, those after the Desperado-style gunplay, may be a bit disappointed.Hmmm...imagine what an extra 20 minutes of character back story, and a shoot-out or two could have done for this movie.....**** stars",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

Fortunately he only has a few lines in the movie, which he didn't manage to deliver well in my humble opinion. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it, especially to people who are into Quentin Tarantino. Rodriguez's directing is amazing in this complicated, well thought-out, and massive amounts of death and destruction. On to Johnny Depp. As always, he puts on an amazing show of his acting abilities in this movie. Although he isn't considered the main character, to me it is him that ultimately makes this film great. I think it's hilarious that he wears a belt-buckle with a marijuana leaf when he gets geared up for battle. His ability to deliver sarcasm and dry humor adds a great deal to the entertainment value of this movie. I love everything that Johnny Depp has done, and this movie is among my favorites of his. All the other actors do their part in making this movie a must-own. You couldn't possibly grasp the entire movie without watching it a few times, at least most people couldn't, including myself.

How could it be bad with a cast like that?But I was wrong. Totally wrong.I have to say, that I have almost never been watching a movie as bad as this one. The script was bad, it was almost just action without a plot. I do not remember much of the story. It was something about drugs, and a Mexican president someone wanted dead. For me was it just shooting, shooting and more shooting. Normally would that kind of movie entertain me, but this one did not.

It didn't drag and I didn't find myself mightily confused about what was going on. Not enough Salma Hayek (not nearly as much as in Desperado, if you know what I mean ;), but there you go.I rewatched Desperado before going to see this, and I wish I hadn't now. I'm a fan of this style of movie, Rodiguez, Tarantino, etc. and OUATIM isn't as good as Desperado. Can't put my finger on why, but it isn't. Maybe it's not as stylish. Maybe the dialogue isn't as good. Maybe the violence seems more gratuitous (although that would seem unlikely). Maybe it's the overly complex plot (films of this nature should be simple, and let the characters progress it rather than the plot, IMHO). Maybe it's all of the above. It's been too long since I've seen El Mariachi to compare it to that, but if you haven't seen any of the trilogy, watch Desperado instead. However, if you just need a thrilling ride, go to see this.One last thing, it's not for the squeamish. Other films of this genre are violent. I don't have a problem with that.

I really enjoyed Desperado and of course El Mariachi so I was expecting a bit of a spectacle here.  Alas it was not to be, and amongst a list of niggles are the haphazard storytelling, action sequences that could have come from a Chuck Norris movie, and a lack of polish all round.  Now I may be missing the point, and in some ways it appears that this was intended as a film that was thrown together by a bunch of friends having fun, but I just think it misses the mark.  Sure, Johnny Depp is great as ever, and Antonio does his thing (but with less charisma and humour than before)..  I dunno, I'd like to say it was great, but I ended up bored, and thats never a good sign (considering it's quite rare with me, I can usually find something redeeming in even the most simplistic of film).",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
260,kimberwing,"Looks Good, Tastes Empty",6,15 September 2003,"With resources beyond his meager beginnings and his earliest wildest film dreams, Robert Rodriguez left a feeling of straying from his original roots, instead focusing on what looks pretty on film.The title itself, as well as the opening credits give a little insight into how the viewer needs to take this movie:  with the proverbial grain of salt. But although Master R doesn't want us to take it too seriously, he wavers into a more deep seated blood-n-guts I'm-going-to-kill-you-'cause-I-can saga.The simple saving grace of this film, beside the fact that Hayek and Banderas look so damn pretty, is Johnny Depp.  Like Pirates of the Caribbean, Depp brings a wry sense of humor and an intelligence to the screen that other characters lack.   He manages to play his character in a subtle yet over-the-top way, and his is the only character we root for, even though we know he's corrupt and bordering on evil.  As Depp's Agent Sands is having a meal in a restaurant, he submits that the food is so perfect that he can't bear to eat it. To explain, he says that his job is to bring balance to Mexico, and thus, the cook must be shot for creating such a perfect dish.  The viewer isn't sure if he's genuine or certifiable, and we still find ourselves wondering as he shoots and kills the cook on the way out the door.All in all, the viewer may feel confused when exiting the theater.  Did we like it or not?  I'm still debating as I write this.

I have to say Johnny Depp is as brilliant as ever.  He plays his corrupt CIA agent character perfectly.  The camera work/angles are excellent and the directing from Robert Rodriguez is great as usual.  I went to the theater today expecting a fresh action film, but what I got was that and more.  To sum the whole movie up, I compare it to three different things. Desperado, mixed with John Woo style action, and tarantino style dialogue.  The ending result is Robert Rodriguez's best film to date.  If you are a fan of his other films, then this film is an absolute must. 8/10",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
262,smw_27,Can ya dig it?,10,17 September 2003,"There's a kind of giddy energy that permeates the movie and that may be mostly due to one man:Robert Rodriguez, who has a hand in pretty much every major aspect of filming, from directing to writing to cinematography to ""chopping"" as he puts it.  If anyone was afraid that Spy Kids would make him lose his edge, they are very mistaken as Rodriguez seems to want to atone for making family movies by making the most needlessly brutal movie of the year. The plot is very confusing involving revolution, bank heists, and revenge. Throw in some plastic surgery, some old scars and a parade of the Dead and you have the movie.  These plot points work surprisingly well with the action, convoluted though they may be, I almost got it...almost. Antonio Banderas settles into his old role with no apparent difficulty and will amaze you with his theatrics and his surprisingly satisfying acting performance. Salma Hayek, Willem Dafoe, Mickey Rourke, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Ruben Blades, Enrique Iglesias, Marco Leonardi and Eva Mendes round out an impressive supporting cast and all of them seem to genuinely enjoy what they're doing and play their roles with vigor, though some are far too underdeveloped.  Poor Enrique Iglesias got boo's just for being Enrique but I thought he did a good enough job.  He knew how to work with the camera and never made any attempts to go beyond his character, while his partner, Marco Leonardi, was simply hilarious.  As for Salma Hayek, her performance is little more then a long cameo, though she does get participate in one rather superb hotel jumping scene that can't be described in words.As for Johnny Depp, well, he does it again. First Pirates, now this...he is clearly the man of the moment and even though he has far less screen time then Banderas, his performance and character are almost equally as memorable. The action scenes go beyond the absurd and some plot developments are thrown in to just make you jump.  But it works, incredibly well.  Shot on digital film, the scenery is gorgeous and the actors stunning.  Banderas's scowl and Depp's smirks look better then ever. Ridiculous. Convoluted. Absurd.

Is it really necessary to shoot away the bad guy's knees and add funny sounds when he keels over? Do you really have to drill out the eyes of your opponent and make a thin one-liner about it?This movie was a crude mess between genres.

Don't get me wrong Johnny Depp is brilliant (as always) and was well cast in the role and Antonio Banderas was consistent but I missed the partnership of Salma Hayek and Antonio that was so entertaining in ""Desperado"". I also found the storyline not as tight as the previous film.Also why oh why did Salma and baby have to die - has Antonio's character got to live a life of misery forever?

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for twists and confusion in films(make them more interesting)but this has one too many.

It is not necessary to have viewed the above films to see ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico."" However, it is probably a good idea. The plot of this one is quite confusing and there are many turns and twists. Unfortunately, Rodriquez wastes much time and talent with his lazy editing. If you are looking specifically for Selma Hayek, don't waste your time here. Her screen time totals about 5 minutes. Antonio Banderas is a secondary character also. Johnny Depp is the star here. His time on screen is, as usual with Depp, interesting. His particularly strange world-view is always fun to see. And just about any movie with Willem Dafoe in it is worth the watch. He is a crazed drug lord in this one. Enrique Iglesias (still with the mole!) trys too hard to be a sexy, pouty Mariachi. The film contains funny moments, most especially when it is trying to spoof modern society. Rodriquez was obviously trying to recreate the ""Spaghetti Westerns"" of the late sixties and early seventies. Unfortunately, he did not succeed. Too bad Sergio Leone died in 1989, he could have helped with this one. Go see it if you are a die hard Depp, Hayek, Banderas fan.

I mean, sure the Antonio ran into a bar, shot up the place, and stormed out untouched, but it's understandable because, hey, it's not made to be taken literally.  It's artful, not realistic, and for that it's a good movie. Robert Rodriguez also takes some chances where other film makers would only shrug off such ideas and gasp at the thought of putting it into film.

I don't use the term epic often. It's rugged. It's tough. It's violent. It's comical. It's over the top. It's the reason you go to the movies. When you strip a filmmaker of the constraints of Hollywood and let him make a movie from the heart, you can really see the heart and soul of a filmmaker in the movie.While this is a sequel to Desperado, the movie is more about an ensemble of characters that include El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas). Admittedly, the plot is a bit difficult to follow, as Double R does try to combine two movies into one (1) the conflict between El Mariachi and a sinister General Marquez and (2) an attempt to overthrow the Mexican Government by a drug lord (Willem Dafoe). The first movie is told through flashbacks, but it does set up a ""revenge story"" for El. There are very few holes in the plot ... if you are paying attention, and no filmmaker should be blamed for having a plot that a select few cannot follow.Only Double R himself has put together a better cast than this (see Sin City). Salma Hayek reprising her role from Desperado. Johnny Depp as the wicked CIA agent that causes problems for everyone (and loves Puerco Pibil). Eva Mendes as his lady-friend/Mexican Agent. Mickey Rourke in the role that brought him back to the spotlight (to go on to Sin City, The Wrestler, and Iron Man 2), Danny Trejo ... nuff said, Cheech Marin as a snobby snitch, plus Ruben Blades (retired FBI) and Marco Leonardi (fellow Mariachi) in amazing and very memorable roles (""I don't think ... I drink.""). I can't support Enrique Iglesias ... I don't know why he is here. Even Tito Larriva is in there (who also appeared in Desperado and From Dusk Till Dawn).Admittedly, this movie is not for everyone. Personally, I rate movies based on if they ""reach the goals they set out for themselves"". This movie wasn't going for an Oscar. It wasn't even going for ""logical action sequences"".

The action scenes and editing combined with the overall look of the ""flick"" are the real big selling points. The look has a rich colorful depth, and a wide screen panarama that harkens back to Sergio Leone. The gun fights are fast and furious as Roberts style of tense editing quickly takes center stage time and time again. Particularly sharp are the shots of the Mariachi reloading his sawed off shotgun. I know shots of someone reloading doesnt sound like the height of action, but in Roberts hands ....well you just have to see it. To those who complain about the violence, what did you expect??Humor is also in proper supply most of it coming from Johnny Depp, whos portrayal as a witty, and psycotic rouge C.I.A. agent steals the show more than once.

While Mexico isn't up to the quality of Leone's masterpiece, it is still a very enjoyable film that should not be missed.The film really has no central character, which adds a kind of epic feel to it.

In the process, he manipulates corrupt army officers, drug cartels, police, and of course, the darkly charismatic El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas). Many many double crosses and betrayals later, the film ends, leaving us with no lasting messages or ideas to ponder, but instead with a resounding feeling of exhileration and entertainment.The performances are all what they should be, though Depp really shines. He delivers his lines like a full blown sociopath, always with a dark sense of humor and a complete disregard for others. The action, as should be expected from Rodriguez, is full blown, over the top, and amazing to watch. Rodriguez really knows how to emphasize the visual aspects of a scene, and his action sequences are as beautiful to watch as they are entertaining. Humorous and action-packed with a sort of mythic and epic feel, Once upon a time in Mexico won't disappoint.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

I remember looking at the cast and thinkin to myself: ""Now there's a movie I GOTS TO SEE!"" And when the opportunity came, I took it. I was absolutely disgussed with it. What a total rip-off! I wants me money back. How can someone so good a director do so bad with such a cast? Banderas, Hayek, Dafoe and ever so wonderful Depp. All gone to waste.The plotlines of the movie are hard to follow and meaningless. The characters are superficial and theres way too many of them! The story of ""El"" and ""Caroline"" after we last met them, is biggest load of (*some text missing due to some coarse language*). Addition to all this, Rodriguez is using Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo, whos characters died allready in Desperado! Some directors can pull that off but not Rodriguez.Summa summarum, the movie is bad. Very bad. Very very bad. Don't ever go to see, or even rent it.

292,llmisterpink,Great,7,4 March 2004,"I loved Desperado and El Mariachi. This one is as good (perhaps the storyline is a little less strong) but it does have Johnny Depp in probably his coolest performance to date. Any weaknesses in the plot are completely repaired my the Depp's ability. The rest of the cast is also fantastic, excellent to see Mickey Rourke back in action and Willem Dafoe is consistently great. Obviously, Banderas is cool and Salma Hayek looks fantastic (fortunately losing the Frida mono-brow.) Robert Rodriguez pulls it out of the bag again. In my opinion, his direction is second to none. Ultimately, his film is intended to be tongue in cheek. It doesn't pretend to be a great movie, but it possesses everything required for great entertainment; explosions, sex, great music, high-octane car chase, plenty of cheesy one-liners and the Deppmeister! I've already bought the poster and pre-ordered the DVD!",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
293,BriannaBee,Fun if you don't take it too seriously (SPOILERS),9,3 March 2004,"BASIC PLOT SUMMARY A corrupt, manipulative and sociopathic CIA Agent named Sands sets the various other characters against each other, getting them to fight his battles for him.  The Mexican president is planning to go after the Barillo cartel, which in turn coopts a corrupt General Marquez into attempting a coup d'etat by killing the president.  Sands coerces El Mariachi into killing General Marques, the same man who killed El Mariachi's family.  In a show of his deviousness, Sands then betrays El Mariachi to the Barillo cartel.  Sands also manipulates retired FBI agent Ramirez into going after Barillo, the man responsible for the death of Ramirez's FBI partner. Showing one of his few weaknesses, Sands misplaces his trust with Ajedrez, a female Federale.  (The ""I'm With Stupid"" t-shirt with the arrow pointing down to his crotch is very appropriate here.  I'm sure that many men can relate to having their judgment clouded by a beautiful woman.)  Gradually, Sands various plots go awry and the movie ends with a bloodbath.THE GOOD Rodrigez's background as a cartoonist is very evident with the larger than life and unrealistic action sequences.  Bodies fly across the room after being shot, El Mariachi can climb walls like spiderman, a blinded Sands can shoot people right between the eyes, etc.  Rodrigez's style of choppy scene transitions keeps the action at a frenetic pace.  He also has a good sense of imagery, especially the somewhat iconic picture of the blind gunman. Salma Hayak is very good in her small role as El Mariachi's wife.  Even when she's kicking a$$, she is still beautiful and alluring.  The same can be said of Eva Mendes in her role as the female Federale who betrays Sands. Ruben Blades, as the retired FBI agent, is very good in his role as one of the few good characters in the film.  Danny Trejo, as always, is very good in his role as Cucuy, Sands sidekick. However, Johnny Depp as Agent Sands completely steals the show.  Somehow, he manages to make Sands cold, evil and sociopathic while still making him charming in an odd way.  By the end of the movie, one almost feels sorry for Sands and doesn't want him to die.  The ice cold deadpan delivery of lines such as ""rip off that eyepatch and skullf**k you to death"" make Sands utterly chilling.  Yet, in the end, Sands is protective of the young boy who helped him.  Interesting sidenote:  Depp wrote ""Sand's Theme"", which plays while the young boy is helping him dress for the final battle.  Also, Rodrigez mentioned in an interview somewhere (can't remember where) that a sequel may be in the works featuring Agent Sands.THE BAD Antonio Banderas was really disappointing in his role as El Mariachi. I've never been a huge fan of Banderas, but this was one of his worst performances.  His character was flat and, quite frankly, did not give one any reason to care about him at all. Willem Dafoe's character was woefully underdeveloped, as was Mickey Rourke's character.  Both of these guys are great actors but weren't given an opportunity to show that.SUMMARY Before watching this movie, remind yourself that it is intended to be a comedy, the action sequences were never intended to be realistic and don't worry about the overly complicated plot too much.  This movie is much better on the second or third viewing.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
294,chris-galea,Fast-funny-cartoon-like-action-filled movie.,7,9 March 2004,"Before I start to comment about this movie, I would like to state my bias. Robert Rodriguez is one of my favorite writer/directors.
Once Upon a Time in Mexico is Rodriguez last installment in the El Mariachi trilogy. And though I still enjoyed it, I must say that I also found it slightly disappointing. Could not really point a finger about what's missing in the movie, but it does lack the sense of freshness evident in the original El Mariachi, or the style executed in Desperado. That said though, I feel that it has been rather unfairly criticized. Ok the plot is thinner than your average model, but then again if plot is what you're after, then you'd better look somewhere else, cause Rodriguez was never big on them. What carries the movie though is its fast pace, cartoon style action, wicked sense of humor, and the variety of characters. The movie is a colour galore, and if you take it lightly it can provide for some good entertainment. The cast as customary with Rodriguez-ed movies is first class, and the addition of Johnny Depp is a big plus point. On the down side of things a bit more of Selma Hayek would have gone down quite well, at least with the male demographic. So if you're into Rodriguez the chances are you've seen the movie already, and if you're not go ahead, just don't expect a serious action movie.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
295,sesshomaru-1,The cover was misleading,8,24 March 2004,I liked this movie very much it was fun to watch very action filled and it had Johnny Depp in it. I thought the cover to be a little misleading though but all in all it was a good movie a little surprising but good.I liked not just because Johnny Depp was in it but because i like action movies and lucky for my he was in it. This was very violent and bloody and they curse a lot but mostly in Spanish so it wasn't to bad.If your looking for a movie you should rent or buy this one if you like action you'll probably be happy with this movie.It may be rated R but it's not to bad so watch see if you like it and if you do tell a friend I'm sure they'll like it too.,Once Upon a Time in Mexico
296,Poe_Writer,"Poor plot, needed more 'Sands' to anchor it",3,30 March 2004,"I had seen its predecessor, Desperado, so I had a small understanding of what was going on. The movie was filled with glorified cameos by Mickey Rourke, William Dafoe (although he seemed to be the antagonist) and Salma Hayek, who I thought was a co-star when I saw the preview.Johnny Depp's character was the gem of the movie. Again, he brings a curious, but likeable offbeat character to life. He breathed life into what was otherwise a poorly written screenplay. I thought Sands (Depp's character) should have had more screen time to anchor the film. Although the main character was Antonio Banderas, to use a mediphor--he was the verb in a very confusing sentence. We saw him move, he was the action, but Johnny Depp drove what little there was of the plot.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

Once Upon a Time in Mexico, however, seemed to fall away from the original feel of the the first two. As a stand-alone action flick, it was alright...it has your car chases, explosions, love-ish story, and gunfights to make anyone sit up and pay attention.But, honestly...to use the cliché, I'd have to split my rating thusly: If you watched the first two, and loved the story, I'd give it 2 out of 5 stars.If you're expecting three sex-icons with lots of guns and stuff blowing up, 3 out of 5.Overall...great popcorn movie.Ayngel Kaimus",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

It's completely out of shape and a down right stupid movie that wouldn't be worth a penny. I was very upset to see the saga of the Mariachi come to an end in such a bad manner. I definitely give this movie two thumbs down on everything or should I say the whole enchilada. I don't blame the actors, but rather blame the people who had to do with the movie making process.

300,Spook_SomethingFresh,"Remarkable piece, just short of a fairytale",7,4 July 2005,"The film focuses on the events in the lives of El Mariachi, (Banderas) an assassin, of unrivalled skill, who is recruited by the corrupt, psychotic CIA agent,(Depp) to take out one General Marquez, (Vigil) after Marquez has assassinated the Mexican President. Murphy's Law ensues throughout, ""Everything that can go wrong, will go wrong"". Everybody has their own agendas, and very little turns out as planned, leaving room for countless scenes of explosive gun-play to endure.Rodriguez exacts a stellar insight into the themes that the title evokes in that the film very much plays out like a tale, displaying humorous exaggerations of human mortality and ability.The film is beautifully captured, inclusive of the day of the dead celebration that takes place, and contains remarkable performances from its leading roles, in particular, Banderas and Depp, as well as formidably entertaining roles from its supporting cast.Despite having thoroughly enjoyed the best of two hours with this title, there was something that bothered me. With so many different events, agendas and screw-overs going on, there is little time and evidence of any real character development within the piece. I felt that I could not significantly connect with any of the characters if only to love or hate them with greater effect. I'm sure that many people will feel that this piece may not meet their expectations for this reason.Still a thoroughly enjoyable piece, and I'd definitely recommend anyone to see it.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

With all the talented actors in this film and Robert Rodriguez again at the helm I just cannot understand what went wrong.No wonder the film was finished in 2001 but not released until 2003.I wish I could say that this was a great film like Desperado but sadly this was not the case.Maybe Robert was just trying to put too much into one film.Let's hope a director's cut surfaces that makes more sense and is not quite as bad.I only gave this film 4 out of 10.,Once Upon a Time in Mexico

306,Desperado775,I liked it. But if you did not...Still read this!,7,18 October 2006,"This is not a real review it is something I wrote for people who insult this film, like some were doing in the IMDb forum.Once Upon a Time in Mexico, the third installment in Robert Rodriguez's El Mariachi trilogy. In case you did not know, the first of the three, ""El Mariachi (1992)"" was made for a mere seven thousand dollars. You can find out about all Rodriguez did to get it made in the trivia for that film. Anyways, El Mariachi put Robert on the map, and landed him a two-year contract with Columbia Pictures.The second of the three films ""Desperado (1995)"", was made for a much higher budget. Seven million dollars! Some think it is not as good as its predecessor but I think it is better. Even when you consider it taking less creativity then the first because of it's much higher budget.Now onto the third of the three, the one I am typing about. Robert said on the Mexico commentary, back in 1995 when he was making Desperado, he jotted notes on a third installment in case he ever did make another. Figuring he never would. But years later was contacted by Columbia to do a follow up to Desperado, even though he was in production of Spy Kids two and three.They had to shoot the movie very fast, which is why I think a lot of people say the film is sloppy. That may be partly true, but those people are also taking the film way too seriously. For instance would a film suppose to be taken very seriously bring back character's killed off in the last movie? I doubt it. This isn't Schindler's List. It is suppose to be fun, and it greatly succeeds.The story really isn't top notch, but the film works anyway. Which I do not think would have if it were not for two things. One: The style. I have not seen a Rodriguez film that did not have a lot of style. And this is no exception. Two: Johnny Depp. He really took the Sands character and made him memorable. Robert said Johnny ad-libbed a lot and brought a lot to that character.I am not saying I did not like Banderas and Hayek, but we have seen them before, so without new characters it would just be Desperado all over again.7 out of 10 IMDb stars 3 out of 4 Critic starsMaybe considering I am such a huge Robert Rodriguez fan has made my opinion of Once Upon a Time in Mexico biased. Or maybe because I know a lot about how the film came to be, but who knowsI hope you enjoy(ed) the film.Final thoughts: Some want to see a follow up to Mexico. I think another addition to the trilogy is completely unnecessary, but if Robert did make another one...I would definitely see it.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

Selma's appearances were unpleasantly brief-- wish we could have seen a little more of her. Micky Rourke was forgettable. Eva Mendez was definitely forgettable. I got a little lost in the plot, but still was able to fully enjoy this movie. If you enjoyed ""Desperado"", then you'll appreciate this movie even more.

The only reaction I had was mild disgust at the (pointless) gross-out scenes (numerous gory shootings, puking, surgery, etc.) and at the empty space in my wallet where the $7.25 I spent on my ticket once was.'OUaTiMexico' had something of a plot, I think... or at least a few random ideas (drifters, guns, fake arms, FBI, eyeballs, guitars, Mexico, Freedom, hot girls) stuck together, and then puffed up and overcooked with a too-big budget.  There were characters, too... or at least a bunch of quirky-cameo celebrities who, well, jump around and shoot stuff. Here were the filmmaker's guidelines, as close as I can figure: Is the character a bad guy?  Have him kill everyone he talks to.  Is the character undergoing emotional anguish?  Blare dramatic music during a close-up of his face.  Is he 'cool' in that hip, ironic, Gen-X way?  Have him wear sunglasses at all times, and walk casually through gun battles.

310,tyippolito,Once Upon A Time In Mexico... There Was A Great Action Flick!,9,3 November 2009,"In what is considered to be a sequel to Mariachi and Desperado, Once Upon a Time in Mexico is an epically entertaining film that picks up where the previous film left off, as ""The Mariachi"" (Antonio Banderas) is brought out of retirement by a renegade CIA agent played by Johnny Depp. In hiding since the death of his wife (Selma Hayek) and daughter, Mariachi is recruited by the CIA to kill a ruthless dictator who happens to be the same man who murdered his family. With plot twists around every corner, betrayal and misinformation become very apparent themes in the film. Mariachi must adapt the ""trust nobody"" approach in order to survive. Because this is the film Rodriguez truly wanted to make when he set out to make El Mariachi, many of the themes and story elements are brought back in Once Upon a Time in Mexico through flashback sequences. Although already dead when the film begins, Selma Hayek's character appears throughout the film in these often breathtaking flashbacks, one of which has the couple handcuffed together while they swing down the side of a building to escape enemy assassins. There are many side stories that help tie together the twisting plot of the film, which includes performances from Willem Dafoe, Mickey Rourke, Eva Mendez, Enrique Iglasias and Cheech Marin. The ensemble cast is one of the reasons this film is so entertaining, but in the end this is Johnny Depp's movie. Despite never appearing in the previous two films of the Mexico Trilogy, Depp steals the spotlight from Banderas in what can be considered one of his best performances to date. Between the blazing gun battles and all-out action sequences, the star studded cast delivers the plot of the film with a comedic charm rarely found in films of this genre. Thanks largely to Rodriguez, who also wrote the film, this is a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. You'll laugh out loud just as many times as you'll be wowed by the stunts and special effects. On top of writing and directing the film, Rodriguez produced, edited, scored, operated the camera, and helped with visual effects. Known throughout Hollywood as the ""one man film crew"", his talents help bring the film to life from the opening scene to the closing credits. Visually, Once Upon a Time in Mexico stands out from your typical action film. Rodriguez is a director who could spend his time and money making Oscar-worthy mainstream films, but chooses instead to have fun with his projects. This is a prime example, as the visuals in the film captivate you enough to almost be able to watch the film with no sound. On the other hand, the original score that Rodriguez created for Once Upon a Time in Mexico is powerful enough to keep you listening with no picture. Put these elements together and you've got proof of the quality of film-making that went into every aspect of this film. Short and sweet, this film is not. The twisting plot may be too much for someone seeking a few explosions and one-liners of the typical action flick variety. If you are able to get past the uncharacteristically sophisticated plot of this action film, and if the over-the-top elements aren't unrealistic enough to sway your interest in this film, you've got a sure fire winner on your hands.This may not be the movie for everybody, but it is certainly worth a look. If you like it, you'll be sure to watch it again and again. The wit and charisma of Johnny Depp alone give this film a unique ability to be seen multiple times without getting old. With this final instalment in the Mexico Trilogy, Robert Rodriguez has proved without a doubt that movies can be fun, dramatic, exciting, and hilarious all at once without lacking a sense of identity. Once Upon a Time in Mexico will quickly move from your list of films to see, to your list of films to recommend... a truly great action flick.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

Replacing the low budget emotional shooter and unknown actors with fireworks and big Hollywood names.Yet as a standalone the film still has its charms. The abundance of characters all fighting for or against a revolution can get confusing but keeps the plot from reverting back to the now stale vengeance story of the two previous installments. Johnny Depp definitely gave a great performance and Enrique Iglesias wasn't as horrible as you would expect.Overall the plot tries to give a political message which gets over shadowed by the shoot outs, roster of Hollywood names, and the fact that you cannot take any of the characters seriously.

319,johny_blues,"Smooth, Sexy and Fun...",10,13 September 2003,"ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO Directed by Robert RodriguezStarring: Johnny Depp, Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Mickey Rourke,Eva Mendes and Willem Dafoe.ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO is by a mile better than any action film this summer, here are my thoughts...The GoodJohnny Depp stole the show as Sands, a villain that is impossible to hate. He gave once again a great performance which might take Mexico to the big millions. Depp is the one standing during the entire film with sharp lines and hilarious t-shirts... ""Sugar Butt""Antonio Banderas, although he was overshadowed by Depp most of the time, He proves he was born to play ""El"", Banderas has a great sense of humor and an excellent chemistry with Salma Hayek.Salma Hayek, she has a small part (she was shooting Frida at the same time and Rodriguez asked her to join the film). Salma gave a sexy and spicy performance, I dare to say that her scenes at the beginning are better than most of the film.Mickey Rourke, Willem Dafoe and Taco Bell.. Dafoe and Rourke were good, but the Taco Bell Chihuahua was the star of the trio... They had a short screen time.Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo, the mexi-cans, both gave very good performances but they were not reprising their roles in Desperado.The BadEva Mendes, she felt out of place in the film, her character was the least likable of them all.The Plot, too confusing for the ordinary masses. I loved the story, but I'm a fan who has seen El Mariachi and Desperado. Average viewers might not understand Rodriguez's vision.The UglyRodriguez should trust in others talents, he is a great director and writer but he is a terrible editor. The mind blowing scene of Antonio and Salma with the handcuffs was almost ruined by Robert's horrendous scissorhands...Overall, the film was great, with lots of fun and action, appeal for male and female, ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO had some classic moments that you should see by yourself but above all, it was entertaining, which was its only pretention.****/*****",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

Other than that I loved it...the eye thing was a little much though lol",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

The fact that whenever someone got shot they would go flying up in the air to do two back flips and one front flip in the air was just retarded. Desperado and el mariachi were about 1,000 times better then this movie and thats all i have to say",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

We're talking ""Batman 5, Return of the Riddler starring Jim Carey as the riddler and Cheech Marin as batman"" kinda bad.  I literally wondered if I feel asleep during it and missed some integral part of the plot. The movie is glorified violence, which I'm usually okay with, but it was just not worth seeing.My 2 cents",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
325,cwasha,Once Upon a Yawwwwwwnnnnnn,1,15 September 2003,The seamstress of plots was drunk.  The casting director was high.  The sound coordinator was deaf.  And the screenplay was written by a monkey.  I feel sorry that Depp had to waste his talent on this.  Anotnio looks like he needed a little help from Jenny Craig.  Hayek was nowhere to be seen (my only real reason tosee this flick).  I had to go to Blockbuster afterwards and rent a movie just to keep from thinking about how I wasted my time.  Better luck next time.,Once Upon a Time in Mexico
326,Michael11444,I want my Money Back,1,15 September 2003,"The only thing worth watching in this movie is Johnny Depp. His character is sadistic, funny, and cool. Robert Rodriguez should have made this character the focus of the movie. Other than that, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's not Ecks vs. Sever bad but it is pretty horrible.

328,jsaxon99,Please pass the plastic blood.,1,16 September 2003,"A very poor remake of ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" with William Holden, except... without the plot. I guess Banderas did have some reason for being upset but what was with J.Depp? A typically deranged CIA Agent who, for some reason, you want to like....but can't quite figure out why. It is certainly not his need to ""keep the balance"" by offing innocent people in one of the ""humorous"" (of which there were probably a total of 3) parts of the movie.Maybe it's the Kid. I think Defoe and Hayek would have loved to have had some of the Kid's lines (or, for that matter....anyone's lines).And the blood...... oh, the blood....and, the more blood. Is it my imagination or did it often look like.....plastic?If it didn't, the movie did. Nothing logical. Nothing real. The only real thing will be the 2nd week drop.Thud!!

329,mehrdadf,this was the WORST! movie in 2003 !,1,17 September 2003,"last night I saw One Upon a Time in Mexico. the trailers of the movie promised a good action movie and the critics were also so-so about it. well, I guess I can say that so far this was the WORST! movie in 2003 that I have seen! First of all, there was no plot at all. it seems that for selling the ticket the director (who was also the producer, composer , cinematographer and many other othings as well), has gathered a group of hot stars and asked them to do whatever they have learned from actions films! there was a lot of gore which was sometimes unbearable. I'll call it a waste of money and time! (my score: 1/10)",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
330,alde20021,Great Movie!!!,9,8 May 2004,"At first, I actually didn't care for all the violence in this movie, but after seeing it again, it is really a wonderful film.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Depp or Banderas.  They both pull off their parts very well, especially Depp who plays a somewhat psychotic CIA agent who has a taste for cheesy t-shirts and funky hats.  He is such a great actor, and if you watch the deleted scenes, make sure to watch the bull fight scene. Banderas also puts in a great performance, one of the few I actually enjoyed, aside from Zorro and Spy Kids. Even if you haven't seen the previous two movies, it still stands alone pretty well.  Great movie!!!",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
331,cetko,An exercise in method,8,25 May 2005,"I regard this film as a manifest of the Rodriguez's way of making movies. It's all too obvious. His goal wasn't to make a substantial film that will compare to El Maricahi or Desperado, but rather to show how expensive and exciting movie he can make out of his own home. (if you didn't know he does most of the editing and post-production in his ""garage""). That is why I won't go into the story. The movie is full of awesome shots, non-stop action, great photography and CGI, but on a story level it don't hold together. And I don't think that that was the point.I consider Mexico to be an exercise in the ""Rodriguez method"" and a movie aimed to show the big studios that an equally fun and expensive looking movie with awesome cast can be made with far less money. It's a must see for Robert's fans, and for others...well...there's Salma Hayek:)",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
332,pdundas,We tried to find something to interest us during this film...,3,8 October 2003,"The film started to drag fairly quickly. For me, the most interesting thing was how much (or how little) Spanish I could remember. For one of my friends, it was the architecture. Unfortunately, for none of our party was it the film itself, which was a tedious sequence of largely pointless shootouts and gratuitous grue, strung together with flashbacks of unsympathetic and uninteresting characters, in implausible scenarios, with unconvincing motivation.Visually, the film was very impressive. But beneath the surface was... nothing.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
333,stateofevil,SWANK!,10,10 December 2003,"I heard this movie is just a boring ole gun fight. They where wrong, I was happy to see they spiced up the good old gun fight movie to one thrilling movie. Johnny Deep was funney like always. They keep you guessing about somethings. I know this is a trilogy but they left it open for one more legend. I am not going to spoil that I hope they do. Those are my thoughts and I am sticking to them.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

This movie I will never get tired of. The action sequences were well put together and the script was easy to follow. I love Johnny Depp and Antonio but my dark side always favors the bad guys.  Geraldo Vigil is the best! No one could have played Marquez better than that.  I know I will catch a lot of feed back from that, so I will just wait for the e-mails to come in.  I don't remember the actor's name that played Armando Barillo, but he was really good as well.  I loved everything about this movie! I recommend it to anyone who loves a good action movie filled with great stars.  I would have liked to have seen Carolina more in this one because she was so good in the first film Desperado.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

The camera work was very smooth on the eyes.Casting was very surprising at first. It first seems as if Depp, who seems to enjoy off-beat films, wouldn't quite fit in with this blow-em-up action movie. But, alas, he has pulled through once again and added his distinct flavor to Sands. The rest of the cast were loyal to their roles. It's alway nice to have such attractive talent.I'm not going to lie: there were times in the plot when my eyebrows involuntarily rose. This review will remain spoilerless, but some of the action scenes are a bit...unbelievable at the least. However, these fantastic scenes blend quite nicely with the children's story motif.On a final note, this movie is full of great one liners.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
338,mugrim,An opinion from someone who liked the movie,10,27 June 2004,"****Spoilers**** (Skip first paragraph to get to actual review) When a friend of mine said that his favorite movie was made for $7000 dollars, I laughed. When he said it was an action movie, I laughed harder, so this weekend, in an attempt to understand why, I rented El Mariachi, Desperado, and Once upon time in Mexico. Once upon a time in Mexico is not a movie that most people will have a neutral opinion about. This is NOT because people have or haven't seen the first two, but rather because of the general plot in the movie. The movie does an excellent job with action, no one could doubt that. What is really amazing to me though is the creative visual style that constantly surprised me. For example, in the first five minutes el mariachi pulls out a guitar in the beginning and the first thing you think is ""Of course it has a gun in it"", but then three minutes later, Johny Depp removes a face arm, something you would have never guessed, but wonder, ""Why don't people do that in real life""? Many will complain that the acting is too over the top, or theirs too much emphasis, but what did you expect from a movie titled ""Once upon a time in Mexico""?! People complain about realism, but think about it, the title itself suggest a mythical setting, so where's the confusion? Johny Depps character was well developed, a brash, smooth, egotistical man who is later humbled somewhat by the loss of his eyes. This movie was made for one reason, to entertain, and it does. Many say there are too many cameos, that Dafoe, Depp, and others provide nothing for the movie, but come on, the movie deals with an attempted revolution in a country. While all revolutions have a leader, this deals with the inner workings of such a revolution, and thus MANY parties are involved in such. The movie is good alone, but I would recommend renting the whole trilogy.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
339,Arsemonk-1,Awesome,10,1 November 2004,"Once upon a time in Mexico was just the film I've been looking for. Ilove the film mainly because it came out at exactly the right time,when I was looking for a good action packed yet simply brilliantfilm. Not only was the gun fights so well placed and thoughtthrough, there was great music as well like 'Malaguena Salerosa'on the guitar just sounded so cool! The plot was fantastic too, I loved the twisted cop role played byJonny Depp and his small battle at the end with the Uzi. I thought that Antonio Banderas' acting was amazing and wassurprised at the fact that Enrique Inglesias can actually act too! I hope they are brave enough to break the trilogy rule and makeanother film... please? If I had to sum up the film in one word I'dhave to say... Awesome and I would advise anyone to watch it!",Once Upon a Time in Mexico

Now I'm much more mature and can grab things in a plot much easier. This second time really changed my mind about the movie..just listen carefully to what the characters say and you will understand it fully, on final thing is do not take this movie seriously at all, have a sense of humor for once. Still don't? Just view it again and it will catch on and it will be quite a fun time.

Now I know the combination of pod & movies often comes out or the good way or the bad. Now this picture was very very bad. The fact that Antonio didn't got hit by the 20 AKs and other scum guns but actually DID hit everyone else with his slight acrobatic moves didn't really impress me...at all! I didn't get the whole storyline, the basics were just about the shooting and real real bad shooting & dodging scenes. It was a real pity and waste of time and thought to watch this movie. The one thing I liked about this movie was a very nice shot of Depp with his bloody face holding a gun and standing all alone on a Mexican street. A nice shot, but the rest didn't have to be made.

Do not and I cannot stress this enough....DO NOT EVER go and see ""Once upon a time in Mexico."" I am still dumbfounded at how appallingly bad this film was and am actually quite upset. Not only do I feel cheated out of the ten hard earned dollars I coughed up to watch it but I feel stupider for having wasted valuable brain space taking on board a plot so unconvincingly constructed it frightens me that Hollywood hasn't taken Robert Rodriguez into a public place and let people throw tomatoes at him.I am always one to try and extract positives from a bad film but as of yet I have never put myself through a film so devoid of any redeeming characteristics. If i could quantify what my time was worth then i would be sending a court writ and demand for financial compensation to which ever studio was responsible for the steaming pile of excrement that was ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico."" Words cannot describe the sense of betrayal I feel......having watched the films predecessors ""El Mariachi"" and ""Desperado"" and both loved and quoted them exhaustively I am at a loss on how to best convey my disappointment to you.Here endeth my rant and let not a further word be uttered upon this subject for I am so disgusted and embarrassed about watching this that I shall deny all knowledge of ever having watched the afore mentioned ""movie"" and am now erasing all memories of it from my head!!!!",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
343,DanielMDimov,"Good idea,bad implement.",4,21 April 2016,"I am confused. There are too many main characters which are hard to follow. The idea of the movie is probably good but it's made bad. You will be confused between switching the main roles and basically in the end of the movie you can't say what is the point of the movie. Is it the love between Johnny Depp and Eva Mendes or the revenge of Banderas, or the rescue of the country or ... or... or... ten more plots. At least the acting is kinda good but if it has to be compared with other movie from the same kind it goes to the bottom, at least for me.The including of Enrique Iglesias is horrible idea... Why? This guy is good for a romantic movie not for a thrilling action. Just imagine Jason Statham in a dramatic romantic movie with zero action in it. It's just not working. If they wanted a good movie, we ( the spectators ) need more things around the storyline of the characters. Okay Banderas one is good, but Johnny Depp's?? It's not so clear what does he wants in this movie. I rate it 4/10 , there is a lot more that everyone wants to see in this movie.",Once Upon a Time in Mexico
344,arturfg-1,Desperado + Once Upon a Time in Mexico,8,31 October 2006,"This is a great and undeniably cool film, the plot was a bit muddled and i didn't feel that the film went anywhere but certain parts like Johnny Depp, Danny Trey and his gang and Mickey Rourke's guy. There were some parts which seemed to have no point at all, like Eva Green's character, and other parts that just weren't good, like, i regret to say it, Willem Defoes guy. However, i think that if Rodriguez had taken the best bits of this and the best bits of Desperado (Steve Buscemi, Antonio Banderas not being pushed to the background, Salma Hayek's character from the first, and a just about believable plot) the end product would have been far more awesome than any of these.

Johnny Depp is a HOT under cover FBI agent who wants to stop a general who wants to kill the president of Mexico. If you love music you will love the music in this movie! I love the movie's music so much i bought the soundtrack.

Antonio Banderas adds some hardly vital pizazz giving the film an amazingly interesting plot and a lot of action at all times. Cameos are well used and special effects are minimal but are not required in this heart-stopping thriller, which can turn to make you grieve. Actors amazing. Plot amazing and lastly direction and writing has to be said pretty well thought out and amazingly well casted. Stars are born in productions like this and Johnny Depp (already discovered) gives rise to one of the most amazing films in history through his portrayal of a new type of character for him, anybody who has seen Pirates of The Caribbean has to swoon at the sight of Mr Depp in a less evil role and the introduction of Latin American charm (courtesy of Antonio Banderas and excellent writing) is the perfect setting for a maturing Mr Depp and his career. Antonio Banderas is best known for his status within the Spy Kids Movies (not necessarily great in themselves) and reprises a similar role with a lot more action and shooting.

The action is gritty, the action is spellbinding and the music, well it IS apart of the Mariachi series so, take a wild guess. Antonio Banderas - as great as he is in this flick he takes shotgun to Johnny Depp's lead. Depp as Sands seems like perfect casting and it's a thrill to see a great actor at the top his game. Selma Hayek - sadly - is not in this one as much and it is a sham, but since she was doing Frida we forgive her, and it actually makes for a more compelling and deeper action movie. El is trapped between a rock in a hard place when it comes to saving his people and saving his own neck. Has Robert Rodriguez puts it ""It becomes a battle of The Man with No Eyes, The Man with No Face and The Man with a Guitar Case"" and it's just that.

Rodriguez is at his prime with this kind of subject matter. Some of the shots and composition is so incredibly beautiful I thought I was going to cry! Wonderful film, don't miss it though you'll lose a lot by not seeing it in the theatre.The colours in the movie are particularly intriguing as well as the reoccurring shape of the guitar. If you are familiar with Rodriguez' earlier works such as El Mariachi you will see a definite resemblance with a more sophisticated edge to it.This is definitely a movie to see if you are a film student or design major in order to study it. You can almost literally pause the DVD at any point and see a wonderful composition to analyze.
