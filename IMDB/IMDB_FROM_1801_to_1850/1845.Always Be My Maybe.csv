0,MartinHafer,Watchable for Keanu Reeves...but otherwise easy to skip.,4,28 June 2019,"""Always Be My Maybe"" is a tough film to watch. One one hand, there are some wonderful performances by some of the supporting characters. But, more importantly, the main characters (in particular the one played by Randall Park) are not likable and I didn't really want the 'happy ending' that seemed obligatory...but not necessary.When the story begins, you see that Sasha and Marcus have been best friends since their childhood. However, eventually their relationship changes and the pair have a very awkward and unsatisfying sexual encounter....and eventually they both go their separate ways. Many years pass and now they are brought back together. In the interim, she (Ali Wong) has become a super-famous and successful chef and he (Randall Park) is a bit of a loser. Now his being a loser is NOT because he's a working class guy. It's more that he's bitter and a bit of snob that I call him a loser. Can the pair manage to get together even though BOTH are apparently involved in other relationships AND he is so angry and judgmental? And, can this successful lady figure out WHY she would want to settle for such a guy?!The supporting characters, especially Keanu Reeves (who plays an odd and awful fake version of himself) are wonderful. But the chemistry between Sasha and Marcus never makes a lot of sense and you question why they writers insisted on making him such a knucklehead. A misfire with some decent aspects to the story.",Always Be My Maybe
1,lee_eisenberg,Netflix is turning out some good features,8,20 June 2019,"Having seen ""Mudbound"", ""Roma"" and ""Always Be My Maybe"", I think that it's safe to say that Netflix is turning out some good feature films. It may have been hard to imagine that a streaming service would do so, but it's true. This story of a romance that starts up again after sixteen years hits all the right notes. I recommend it.",Always Be My Maybe
2,blanche-2,cute romcom,7,16 February 2021,"Cute rom com about two people, Sasha and Marcus (Ali Wong and Randall Park) who knew each other in childhood and early teen years and reconnect 15 years later.Sasha is now a celebrity chef, and Marcus is still living at home and working for his father. They aren't that excited about getting together.There are some sweet moments in this film, but the funniest scene takes place in a restaurant with Sasha's hot date, Keanu Reeves. He is HILARIOUS. The whole restaurant set-up is a riot. Park says something like ""I just ate a $640 meal and I'm starving."" The movie is worth seeing just for that part.Very pleasant.",Always Be My Maybe
3,ComedyFan2010,A really fun comedy,9,8 June 2019,"I like romantic comedy but this one is also one that has a lot of great humor. I really laughed out lout at many of the jokes. It was created by great comedians, also had a cute story and some good acting. The date with Keanu Reeves was also a great addition. The restaurant where they ate was ridiculous and funny and the game they played had many great jokes. Netflix usually doesn't do as well with movies as with TV shows but this one is sure a winner.",Always Be My Maybe
4,cherold,bland rom-com with a few hilarious minutes in the middle,6,10 September 2019,"In Always Be My Maybe, two childhood friends who once hooked up reconnect. She's become famous, he not so much. They sort out their feelings. That's pretty much the story.The series is directed by Nahnatchka Khan, who created the TV series Fresh Off the Boat, and there are more laughs in one episode of that show than in this entire movie. Most of those laughs happen in a burst of hilarity at a chi-chi restaurant and directly after. These scenes, both of which feature Keanu Reeves playing a really awful version of himself, could be the basis of a much better movie.So that's the Com, but what about the Rom? Well, that's an issue too. Sasha dates jerks, but when a friend tells her she should go for Marcus and she says he's a ""stealth jerk"" she's absolutely right. And because we see how jerky he is it's really hard to hope those two wind up together. Also, while Randall Park and Ali Wong have an easygoing chemistry, it's very much friends chemistry. I never felt this were two people who really *should* be together. Comfortable chemistry would be fine if it seemed like they'd make a good couple, but as I say, he's a jerk, so you need really electric chemistry to make it seem like they should be together in spite of that.It's all perfectly watchable and pleasant enough, but it's definitely a second-tier rom-com.",Always Be My Maybe
5,ThomasDrufke,Don't Let the World Pass You By,7,22 June 2019,"If there's one thing Netflix seems to be doing pretty successfully (besides TV), it's rom-coms. Always Be My Maybe was the next big comedy to make waves through the renowned streaming service, and to mostly good results. Ali Wong and Randall Park play two lovers who reconnect after not having seen each other for over a decade. Park, who has been poorly miscast in a few recent comic book films, plays great off Wong and vice versa. And as I say about most of these films, it can be painfully cheesy without the right actors & director. Luckily, that's not the case here. Plus, an extended cameo from Keanu Reeves as himself made this film all the more enjoyable. So even if the rom-com genre isn't necessarily getting the screen time in theaters it deserves, I'm glad it seems to be making a resurgence on the small screen.7.7/10",Always Be My Maybe
6,Thanos_Alfie,Nice story...,5,11 August 2020,"""Always Be My Maybe"" is a Comedy - Romance movie in which we watch two best friends reunite after 15 years. Their lives have changed but their personalities and their relationship did not. They both face different difficulties in their lives and start to wonder about their life choices.I liked this movie because it had an interesting plot with many hilarious moments along with romance. The direction which was made by Nahnatchka Khan was very good and I liked the way she presented the lives of our main characters, their dreams and their true fears. The combination of some dramatic moments with comedy and romance made this movie even better. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to say that both Ali Wong who played as Sasha Tran and Randall Park who played as Marcus Kim were simply outstanding and they both did an excellent job on their parts. Finally, I have to say that if you choose to watch ""Always Be My Maybe"" you will have a great time and you will laugh too.",Always Be My Maybe
7,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Always Be My Maybe,6,20 July 2019,"6/10 - with Ali Wong and Randall Park, I thought this would've been a tad funnier, but it was still a charming rom-com",Always Be My Maybe
8,kwenchow,A bit weird but not bored at all! Surprisingly watchable! Quite funny too!,6,9 June 2019,"The film begin with the childhood life of Sasha and Marcus in 1996! They are neighbor since that time! Actually they already is like a so called lover, because they already hanging out regularly! Sasha even admit she crushing Marcus since childhood at the end! Until 2003, Marcus mother died, they separated! At present day 2019, they both have their lover! The story is about how they trying to get together again! The relationship depicted by two main character actually quite weird but still is acceptable for me! Have several funny scene! They make love in a car at 2003, Marcus challenge his father battle a dance with him! Marcus throw up the food Jenny keep feeding him! The introduction of Keanu Reeves also a bit intense and funny! He show off his no glass spectacles to Marcus! Showing off he knows many China leader and even he challenge a fight with Marcus! The end credit song, I think Keanu Reeves fans sure dislike the lyric! Lol! But the rhythm quite good actually! The two main character eventually get together, when Marcus confess at the award ceremony red carpet! Marcus father also found a new lover at the end! Sasha open a restaurant with Marcus mother recipe really very touching! Not as good as Crazy Rich Asians! But still is a good movie to enjoy!",Always Be My Maybe
9,henry8-3,Always be my Maybe,6,7 January 2020,"A couple, from small kids to adults always seem to mess things up just as they seem to becoming a couple. Their lives go in different directions for years with him becoming an air conditioning engineer, her a hugely successful chef and restauranteur. Then they meet up again.Whilst the romcom story elements are hardly radical, this is a genuinely funny and sharp comedy with two lovely central performances, supported by a great turn by Buteau and a hysterical send up of himself by Keanu Reeves - the scene in the hugely ostentatious restaurant is one of the funniest of the year.",Always Be My Maybe
10,iquine,Straight Forward and Amusing,7,13 September 2019,"(Flash Review)Two childhood friends, boy and girl, lives split after high school. The boy ends up a regular Joe while the girl becomes a hard working celebrity chef. 18 years later their paths cross and their childhood awkward romantic feelings reemerge. Will they be able to mesh with their established adult lives together? This is simply an entertaining RomCom movie. Good acting with a hilarious cameo by Keano Reeves....he actually wasn't monotone and appeared to actually be acting much to my surprise! No prize for guessing where the story ends up but the ride was amusing.",Always Be My Maybe
11,aidanratesmovies,"Average, but decent rom-com with a fun and lively cameo from Keanu Reeves",7,6 July 2019,"Though quite average and formulaic at times, Always Be My Maybe manages to take risks with much success, even while not totally being a great romantic comedy. The film is well acted, and well told, minus some structure issues. The overall look makes for a dazzling and at times romantic spectacle that seems fitting for the film, but at times may prove distracting rather than helpful. Needless to say, Keanu Reeves somewhat cameo halfway through the film makes for the most joy in an otherwise average story, and is surprisingly done with just the right amount of ridiculousness without taking it too far. In the end, the film is sweet, and obviously not perfect, but it has its quirks and provides a certainly interesting addition to the Netflix rom-com catalog.
My Rating: 7.5/10",Always Be My Maybe
12,vithiet,"Entertaining and funny rom-com, even if not the most original",8,1 July 2019,"While it is a fairly formulaic rom-com, I liked it more than I thought I would. Maybe it's the Asian connection (I""m half) or the fact I live in San Francisco, I'm not sure. Casting is really great and all the actors give great performances; the Keanu Reeves cameo had me in tears! Definitely a feel good flick that's perfect if you're feeling down.",Always Be My Maybe
13,muamba_eats_toast,Reasonable fun,7,11 January 2020,Whilst the film doesn't break any new ground and is fairly formulaic it still has that feel good factor with two very likeable leads and enough actual laughs to get by. It won't blow your socks off but perfect for a quiet night in.,Always Be My Maybe
14,PsychoBeard666,Not bad at all,9,12 June 2019,"A spin on the usual rom com tropes but does suffer from a few cliches.
Some jokes don't land but the ones that do more than make up for it.
Has one of the best cameos from an actor willing to portray himself as insufferable because in real life he's anything but.",Always Be My Maybe
15,Rob-O-Cop,good bits surrounded by sausage factory filler,6,7 July 2019,"There were some funny bits here and some good acting but that was diluted by factory cheese and dumbed down with mass market filler material, bling, cliche material and scenes, and the characters and actors deserved better than that, which was weird cos the 2 of the three writers were the 2 main cast members.
should have been funnier, could have been funnier, the Keanu Reeves bit showed somebody knows funny, an ok watch with moments of warmth depth and cleverness.",Always Be My Maybe
16,mikayakatnt,"Fun, lighthearted yet shallow",6,22 March 2020,"A get-together, break-up, and get-back-together type romcom film.Always Be My Maybe is lighthearted, funny, and genuine. Everyone has genuine chemistry that is noticeable beyond the film.The only thing that broke my suspension of belief is the fact that Marcus is still able to somehow survive San Francisco living costs with only a HS diploma. Like...how?Did love that extra Asian-American representation though. And that ending is 10/10 beautiful.(And if y'all haven't noticed from everyone else's reviews, there is a surprise cameo that basically steals the show.)3/5. Fun, lighthearted romcom to watch during a rainy Friday night. Don't expect a deep script or too many underlying symbolism. Turn your brain off and enjoy the show.",Always Be My Maybe
17,kjproulx,A Feel-Good Watch,8,31 May 2019,"Netflix has been on a streak of releasing very solid romantic comedies over the last couple of years. From Set It Up being one of their absolute best, to even enjoyable films like Someone Great or When We First Met, it almost feels like the home for the best romantic comedies is on Netflix these days. That's not a bad thing, because I just don't see many audience members flocking out to movies like this in the theatre anymore. I definitely see a change coming in the next five to ten years in terms of where certain genres will end up. With that said, Always Be My Maybe is Netflix's latest release in this genre and if this one doesn't make you smile, you're probably just not in the right mood to watch.Sasha and Marcus have been friends since childhood but eventually had a falling out in their teenage years. Slowly falling for each other once they land on their feet in their adult days, hilarity and drama ensue. While the premise itself isn't exactly something that people will be writing home about by the time 2019 comes to a close, this really is a film that puts its characters in the forefront, which made for a highly enjoyable little comedy. I was actually very happy I watched this film because it shed new light on Randall Park.Personally, I've always seen him popping up as the butt end of a joke in comedies and I never found him all that funny. Surprisingly, give him his own film and suddenly he shines brightly. I thought he did a fantastic job here as Marcus and having written the screenplay with his co-star Ali Wong probably added to the chemistry that leaps off the screen between the two of them. Wong is fantastic here as well, but my biggest complaint with this film is that there are times when I found myself disliking the actions of both characters, which did slightly hurt my enjoyment of the movie as a whole.Yes, by the time the film ends, everything falls into place nicely, but certain things didn't feel quite earned. From being rude to feeling slightly out of character at times, there are lines of dialogue that felt very off-putting. There were certain scenes that felt like a different film to me. Yes, most movies need low points and yes, arguments between characters are inevitable in a film like this, but some harsh things are said sometimes and are just brushed off later on. For that, I didn't quite love this movie as a whole, but don't let that make it seem like I didn't think it was a great movie nevertheless.In the end, Always Be My Maybe is a very sweet story that does play with a few cliches along the way and is very predictable by the third act, but with some solid characters, a scene-stealing cameo that is easily the highlight of the movie, and a feel-good premise, held together by a solid score and soundtrack, there were times when I just couldn't stop smiling. If you're looking for an easy feel-good movie to watch, I think this one is worth your time.",Always Be My Maybe
18,cardsrock,Well matched leads,7,16 June 2019,"The easy chemistry between Randall Park and Ali Wong is the standout in this rom com. Both have their subtle humor down pat and play off of each other well. I enjoyed the skewering of San Fran hipster culture and most of the comedy throughout. The biggest negative is that the resolution doesn't feel entirely earned and seems a little too Hollywood/unrealistic for real people. However, it is still full of genuine feel good moments and laughs. Also, the Keanussaince is raging on this summer. His cameo in which he plays himself is the highlight of the film and even funnier because he's the complete opposite in real life.",Always Be My Maybe
19,FrenchEddieFelson,Yes!,6,31 May 2019,"A tender rom com that I enjoyed right from the start when Sasha shuts her door in the face of Marcus until the credits during which Marcus sings his memorable encounter. The success of the film owes much to the actors playing the two main protagonists, either teen or adult, as well as the wacky and awesome presence of Keanu Reeves, as a repulsive guest star. The characters are globally endearing and transform this conventional story in a delightful rom com.",Always Be My Maybe
20,Offworld_Colony,Why did I love this movie so much?,8,10 February 2020,"I got that it wasn't flashy, but it wasn't bad either. It had acting and comedy chops without being crass or obvious. It was solid and told a story with people of colour without resorting to making it a message-movie. Hamilton-syndrome maybe; representative without being about representation. Yes, it felt like good TV and not great movie, with its Netflix standard crispness, but it knows its audience. I very much liked this sort of effortlessly pleasing romcom with real chemistry and no pretensions.",Always Be My Maybe
21,donaldricco,"a rom com, in San Francisco",7,8 August 2021,"Well, it's a rom-com about childhood sweethearts that meet up again after 16 years, or so. And I enjoyed the first hour quite a bit! Both leads are good, cute, and funny, and through the Keanu Reeves scenes, I was entertained. I also live in the Bay Area, so it was cool seeing all of the exterior shots in San Francisco! But A. K. (after Keanu), the cheesy rom-com stuff got thick, and the movie lost my interest. You know, ""you can't live in my world, and I can't live in yours"" sappiness that just makes me cringe. But the first hour was worth it, and the songs by Hello Peril went right on my Spotify list!",Always Be My Maybe
22,TaylorYee94,Classic rom-com with a spice of modernity,7,3 July 2021,"A plot that never fails. Best friends having feelings for each other, but the timing sucks. However, at the end, one runs to another and confesses love. Simple story but works beautifully. The only problem is that it is overdone for a long time. 'Always Be My Maybe' adds a touch of modernism. A female protagonist as a driven and ambitious career woman expresses her feeling first, and the film is not afraid to show ethnic culture openly as way it is. The development of the movie sends out beginner's vibe. In a good way. It is Alice Wong and Randall Park's first debut film as writers and producers. The story itself is well-developed with a few cutesy scenes. Expressions are more down-to-earth and similar to everyday conversation rather than trying to impress the audience with fluent and refined lines. 'Always Be My Maybe' or 'The Lovebirds' are similar in that way. Stand-up comedians who have worked as partners for a long time direct and write the movie and become love interest protagonists. I am fond of that vibe 'so fresh and young because it's the debut film'.The disappointing part is acting and chemistry. Randall's acting brings down the energy because he does not portray different feelings in various way. I understand that Marcus is a bit introvert and lazy, but it is expressed the same way from the start to the end. The chemistry between the two is okay when they are friends but becomes worse when they are couple, keeping me thinking that they are better off as friends.",Always Be My Maybe

In this film, it was a classic subject, taking a little change and created a different scenario.Recently already korean actors think the popular CRAZY RICH ASIANS movie pioneers also in the filmI think there were successful jokes from the movies.
Keanu reeves had excellent access to the film, but I think it was too long in the film I think he didn't need the hotel scene.
I would definitely like to mention Randall Park.

As its own effort, it really works out well; although there are some flaws, there are unexpected elements, such as the appearance of Keanu Reeves as himself, which during his entire screen time, the movie goes to a higher level of fun.Overall it was a nice rom-com, nothing spectacular but surely fun entertainment.",Always Be My Maybe

I've always really liked Ali Wong, never a mega fan necessarily but loved her in things I saw. Can't say I was a Randall Park fan, it's not that I didn't like him, I just didn't ever love any of his projects. This one is such a win though. FINALLY such a cute rom com that's not rushed or corny or lame. Ali Wong And Randall Park are both writers and producers on this project! It really makes me fans of both of them. Please tell me there's a sequel in the works already! There have been so many high school stories on Netflix so this was a nice, fresh story. We need more of these quality rom coms!!!!

31,LukeCustomer2,I had heard such great things..,5,25 November 2019,"The start of the movie is promising. With a good and funny lead up as to how two kids can be best friends for years ""do it"" and never speak to each other again. But then the adult versions came along and I didn't really get anything from them. After the break up Marcus goes on to live in his fathers basement (figuratively) and Sasha goes on to be a world famous chef. When they run into each other again they start hanging out and, you know where this is going. But it didn't work for me. I never felt the love or romance between them. When will Hollywood learn that sex is not a replacement for that. They also set up a situation where both of the characters have diametrically opposed lives and like them that way. So I guess I am supposed to root for one of them to change their entire life at mid age? That is never going to work. Also wasn't a fan of Keanu's cameo. It is extended the movie needlessly and I thought it was weird. It is a good way to kill two hours but don't get Netflix for it.",Always Be My Maybe

Something that caught me off guard right from the start was the happy Asian dad that was quick to laugh... I can't think of the last time an Asian patriarch wasn't portrayed as authoritarian and cranky. I think everyone can relate to having that friend from childhood that has a little piece of our heart wherever they go like these characters. It's also a movie that didn't take itself too seriously and even poked some fun at some PC topics. I'm not usually a big Ali Wong fan - she's a little mean for my taste - but she played a great vulnerable, empathetic character.

The background of these characters were set up really well and didn't really have any plot holes. There was also a great cameo that I got so excited when it happened.

40,rmirchandani,Best romantic comedy in a while! Keanu Reeves was hilarious and amazing!,10,26 June 2019,"The romantic comedy Always Be My Maybe is such a cute and fun movie for everyone. It will make you laugh, cry and fall in love with the two main characters. Ali Wong and Randall Parker have amazing on screen chemistry and I definitely rooted for them to end up together. The movie had a simple plot and this was one of the reasons why it succeeded. It was entertaining from start to finish and I never felt bored when watching this movie.Similarly to Crazy Rich Asians, this movie featured two Asian actors who play the lead role. The difference between Crazy Rich Asians and this movie is that Always Be My Maybe does not have an only Asian cast.The most shocking scene for me was when Keanu Reeves showed up. His appearance was surprising and unpredictable. He behaved unpleasantly which is not him in real life. In real life, he is one of the kindest and sweetest actors in Hollywood. I can honestly say that Keanu Reeves did an amazing job as an actor in this movie.Randall Parker performed his song titled ""How I punched Keanu Reeves"" in the end credits. This was a fitting and humorous way to end the movie. Additionally, showing us the pictures of the main characters as children and afterwards as adults in the end credits beside their names was a sweet touch. I can definitely recommend this movie to anyone. Everyone should watch it once in their life.",Always Be My Maybe

One is an arrest development man-child and the other is a pretentious over achiever. Thing is the movie treats the female lead's every movement and breath like a mistake, how dare she aim high or feel resentment for her miserable childhood...Oddly the man-child only gets called out on his flaws in a reactionary way. There is no chemistry between the two and it feels like forced romance. Keanu Reeves cameo is AMAZING and hands down the best part of this slog.",Always Be My Maybe

And this is not the first time! OMG! NETFLIX! Stop taking your customers for granted.This is a light-hearted, belly-laughing, love story with awesome characters, great performances, and a splendid showcase for the scene stealing Ali Wong...So, for THAT, THANK YOU Netflix for creating a platform that offers authentic entertainment a chance to be seen, and a chance for all of us to pull ourselves away from the phony anglo-centric hollywoodism that routinely churns out mediocre excuses for advertisements.Bring on more!",Always Be My Maybe

That is the most sleazy , every dirty word you can think of for sex and women's bodies part I have ever heard from a woman comic.

60,Nathan_Needs_A_Username,Movie Review: Always Be My Maybe,7,10 June 2019,"This was a pleasant surprise for me, having heard some positive buzz online and then finding myself with a couple of free hours I thought I'd check it out. My expectations were fairly low given how played out the romantic comedy genre has gotten by this point but I have to say that even though I am not a big fan of the genre I have to give a recommendation for this one.Ali Wong and Randall Park are both very funny people in their own right and they bring their A game to this film. Both of the two main stars have writing credits and so the film can at points feel like a vessel to showcase their talents as comedians. This can be a positive or a negative depending on your existing opinions about the work of the two leads, for me this was absolutely a good thing with he pair firing on all cylinders throughout.Another thing this film has going for it is an attention to detail that is rarely seen from movies of this nature. The bay-area setting is used to full advantage and impacts on how the characters interact with each other and the situations they find themselves in. For example this film uses the trope of the failing musician, other than having the character's band sound like a generic rom-com soft rock band they build of the hip-hop style soundtrack. The three original songs performed by the fictional band feel as though they would fit perfectly within the Bay Area sound and I instantly added them all to my party playlist.As far as the story goes it is incredibly generic, while this is a fresh feeling film, it isn't exactly breaking new ground with any plot details. If you are tired of the rom-com formula then maybe this could be an issue for you but personally I think that this has enough good jokes and heart to keep you engaged.Don't watch the trailers if you are planning on checking this out as they spoil the best part of the movie and the revel works so much better if you don't see it coming.I think this is a really entertaining Rom-Com showcasing the talents of its two leads. If it sounds like your thing give it a shot.",Always Be My Maybe
61,peter07,Could've been so much more,6,3 June 2019,"I was really rooting for this pic, which featured two Asian Americans in the lead roles. It pretty much disappointed on many fronts.1) The settings are SF, LA and NY, cities with high Asian populations. Many Asians tend not to hang out with each other in the lesser cities unless through school or church.2) The movie just assumes the female lead dates Asian men, when this is far from the case that I've seen. Discrimination against Asian men by Asian women in the U.S. (unless the Asian man is loaded) is a real problem.3) We don't really get to know the characters all that much. I would've liked to see a bit more about how Marcus took his mother's untimely death and how Sasha dealt with being a latch-key kid (I was one, too).4) I also have an issue with how these characters were just Asian versions of white characters in rom-coms.5) I hardly think Keanu Reeves was needed in this film, esp. as himself (though I know his father was an ethnic Chinese from Hawaii).6) The movie seems to ignore a lot of issues Asian Americans go through in the U.S. like racism, even when you've ""made"" it like Sasha, pressure to do well in school and life and clashes between Asian parents and their children in U.S. society.I did enjoy parts of the film (except Park's rapping, UGH) but I hope they make better ones from now on.",Always Be My Maybe
62,spmact,"A decent rom com, but nowhere near a classic",7,2 June 2019,"I should start by saying that I thought Crazy Rich Asians was much better (if we really need to compare ""Asian"" rom coms) and really deserved all they hype it got. This one, not so much.Looking at this on its own though, I think the characters were likable enough, but the romance between the two wasn't really believable. I can understand the two had a history, but it seemed a lot more believable that they'd be good friends instead of lovers. I didn't really buy the chemistry between the two characters, and their relationship development seemed a bit rushed.Ali Wong was great in this, and seemed to outshine Randall Park in most of their scenes together. The Keanu addition was also a nice touch and came out of nowhere but was a pleasant surprise.All in all, even though this was pretty predicable and by the numbers, it didn't seem sincere and felt a bit forced towards the end just because they had to wrap things up. I know this is really subjective, but the comedy could have also been better. I laughed maybe a couple of times, but that's about it.It wasn't a complete waste of time, but not one I'm going to go out and recommend to all my friends.",Always Be My Maybe

Of course, it helps that I was already a fan of Ali Wong's stand-up, I just had no idea she could ace the acting thing too.
And I was already an even bigger fan of Randall Park, so there you go. Prepare me a dish with ingredients I like and we're halfway onto a winner.It should also be noted that one of the highlights was a cameo from Keanu Reeves playing a version of himself (and referencing John Wick of all things), who managed to be funny here and more in an 'acting' mode in his 20mins of screen-time than any of his movies from the past decade. (To be fair, I haven't seen them all, but you can just tell from his expression on the posters. Let it also be noted that I still love the guy in whatever he plays, regardless).Also, I must be emotionally sensitive beyond my years, because I teared up when we find out that the kid's mom dies within the first 5mins of the movie, and I teared up again at the end when *spoiler* Sasha shows Marcus the menu of her new restaurant, which she named after his mother.

The humour was a nice mix of self mockery and of taking the mickey out of the pretentiousness of the ""it"" foodie crowd. Yes, there were some problems, but what is perfect, cos overall I enjoyed it. I was going for a 7+ but the song in the end credits kicked it up to well over an eight for me -- not because of the ""action"" itself, but because of the awesome fun with the lyrics describing that action (is that descriptive yet vague enough, lol). I've not been been much of a fan of Keanu Reeves since his early work (and since hearing about him forgetting his line in a theatre production, then breaking character to make a joke about it -- that's an insult to all theatre, whether you're on the stage, behind it, or in front of it -- wouldn't have gotten away with it if he wasn't a ""star""). That being said, he did add a nice jolt to this movie. The rest of the cast was a lovely solid surprise too. Little disappointed that Charlyne Yi wasn't given more to do.

SCREENPLAY:Michael Golamco, Ali Wong, Randall Park,
STARRING: Ali Wong, Randall ParkAlways Be My Maybe is the latest rom-com from the Netflix stable, which seeks to sate our thirst for such stories without sacrificing on political correctness or honesty in relationships. The movie is a breezy, flee-flowing watch.We know how this goes. Childhood friends, separated by time and harbouring resentment from that last argument, meet again at differing stages of their career and life, rediscovers their spark and goes on to face trials and tribulations before they get together for good in the final act.What is different, in degrees, is the warmth and spark of humour and honest sentimentality, which treats both the characters as equal partners in their relationship. I'm rather sick of the mainstream movie final act in which the guy has to do a grand gesture to convince the girl to stay (usually an airport run), or a big sacrifice, mostly related to their career, that one or both of them has to do ( Sweet Home Alabama). Hence, I was refreshed to see that each of them has to mature and move halfway to meet the other. Ultimately, it's not a compromise that does it, but a decision to move forward together.That said, there are plenty of character beats, plot contrivances and segues that we've seen, and will continue to see on screen, a thousand times. Not enough time is spent on their childhood friendship other than the oft-repeated montage of moments. Marcus Kim (Park) still has a lot of growing up to do in his life, and by the end of the movie has only started his journey. He mostly remains a sharp-witted, talented but scared man-child throughout the movie. Sasha Tran (Wong) has to still learn to make proper human connections and not try to solve problems by throwing money at them. I know people like these, and having seen some of them grown and succeed, and some of them try to and fail, is the one of the many positives I took from the movie.VERDICT: Great one-time or two-time watch. Definitely better than most rom-coms, which unfortunately isn't high praise.Keanu Reeves is awesome.Cribbing aside, this is a success for Asian Hollywood and general casting diversity in movies.I mean, they are great as friends.

The story hits every single cliché in this category and is suitable consumption for those who only watch movies that provide no new content at all.Things are made constantly worse by first-time director's constant lack of comic timing. But to begin with, much of the comedy is nowhere near what should be expected from these talents. Writing is uninspired and flat.Neither have Wong and Park chemistry that would support the story. Both are of East Asian ancestry but that's not enough.

The type of unrecyclabe plastic that is poisoning sea life even as we speak - from her over sized plastic glasses to her clumsy plastic boots. On the other hand you could smell Randall Park's sweat and farts in his weed incensed room - but as a rapper? He does not even qualify as a wannabe. He is used as a pawn to satisfy the current feminist movement. I mean who can be so submissive in real life. One does not need to be Trump to call him 'stoned-out cold loser'. What the 'couple' had in common was just that they are Asian and lived next door to each other when kids. That's it.

The characters are believable and engaging, and they develop throughout the course of the film, which doesn't always happen with rom-coms.One thing I particularly love about this film is, although it features many excellent Asian actors, it doesn't trundle out old tropes about Asia or Asians. This is about two people who happen to be Asian, and their lives, which happen to feature occasional details about Asia, because they are Asian. We see a different take on what it means to be an American, but it's a realistic take, not an amalgam of everything every Asian-American has every experienced.Thoroughly enjoyable!",Always Be My Maybe
101,ride-897-729359,Ali Wong who ?,8,2 June 2019,"I had never heard of Ali Wong until this rom com. She totally stole the show. This is a refreshing comedy/romantic film that touches the heartstrings.
Great acting and production.
Killer soundtrack.",Always Be My Maybe
102,abeburnett,Waaaay better than the usual Netflix Original,9,25 June 2019,"This was a fantastic romantic comedy: intelligent, genuinely funny (almost choked on my drink more than a few times), heart warming, with genuine chemistry and situations between the leads. I felt like this was one of the few recent movies (or TV shows) which avoided being overtly political and just had real characters with real desires and conflicts trying to find their happy ending. Well done to the producers, director, writer, actors, and all the crew. Truly fabulous work, y'all. I loved the leads and Keanu (HILARIOUS, buddy). Absolutely zero complaints about this one. Loved it!",Always Be My Maybe
103,ddcraver,I really wanted to like this film..,6,1 June 2019,"I didn't hate it.. In fact, I really wanted to like this film! Unfortunately, Randall Park fails to rise to Ali Wong's emotional level in the key critical emotional scenes. It's not that I don't appreciate Randall Park.. I do, especially in The Interview & Ant Man.. but, it's just really obvious that Ali Wong is capable of channeling genuine emotion at a level that Randall Park is not.. or, at least, not in this case. Basically, more a complement to Ali than a put down to Randall. It's still a little early yet to tell whether or not Ali Wong will sustain a lasting film career.. if she does, the prospect of seeing her cast in a more emotionally challenging role is definitely intriguing. Also, I did really like the supporting players.. solid overall casting here.. and, I genuinely appreciated Keanu's willingness to be the comedic ""heavy"" when, by all accounts, he's is the exact opposite in real life. 6/10",Always Be My Maybe

The ending is predictable but it's well worth a watch.,Always Be My Maybe
105,whollycow,Too clever by half,7,2 June 2019,"Despite its self-referential wink-wink script, I ended up liking this movie. Not a bad way to spend 90 minutes if you're in the mood for a rom-com.",Always Be My Maybe

Overall a thoroughly enjoyable show.,Always Be My Maybe
107,pazortegaandrade,Always Be My Sugar Mommy,2,13 May 2020,"I thought this movie was going to work on the basis that both main characters werent honest with themselves and their partners. Instead non of their personal issues get fix; this movie is not about love, but about money and a touch of sentimentalism.Towards the end, male MC realizes that either he could be in a relationship with a woman that will pamper him with money and love, seriously??? is a no brainer to not go for it.
You could call me cynical, but... the only thing that was making him doubt about the decision to move to new york with her was his pride.
From the beginning of the movie, he was afraid to try, so why would he kid himself on his band being successful or have a life in san francisco when he could just have the support from a rich woman that loves him?Seriously... Imagine yourself in that position, you happen to meet an attractive person that loves you and wants to support you financially while your career hasnt even lift up at all... would you decline that offer?Anyways... to the writers, try to do it better next time. This wasnt a romantic comedy, change the title to 'Always be my sugar daddy/mommy', actually that's a great idea; you could make a prequel but with the genders switched.",Always Be My Maybe

109,packor,would have enjoyed when I was young and naive,4,7 June 2019,"This movie seems to be geared towards women empowerment. The woman makes the dough, and she provides for the man and lifts him up, and he accepts that and he accepts being the support. I am okay with that.But this film sends the wrong message. The man, in essence, is a loser. He was unsuccessful, frickle, undecisive, and insensitive. At the end of the film, none of this has really changed. All that happened was that he started actually trying to live life. I think that women can love someone like that, but it's not that common. Think about it; would you want a man like that? If successful women want a pet like that, let me know. I am sure I can comply.",Always Be My Maybe

116,theseventhstooge,Funny and enjoyable,10,31 March 2020,I watched this for the first time tonight. I say first because I know I'll watch it again. The only part I could have done without was the Keanu Reeves scenes. The subplot was weak. Randall and Ali had great chemistry. The story dragged at times but overall it was a fantastic romantic comedy.,Always Be My Maybe
117,ricaelamae,Meh,3,1 June 2019,"Honestly this movie is kind of difficult to stay with; I paused it at 60 minutes and couldn't believe there was still another half hour left.
It's hard to be invested or care about either main character as one is an arrested development man-child and the other is a pretentious jerk. Their personalities and life style are not compatible and the chemistry just isn't there. Unbelievable romance and almost no comedy.",Always Be My Maybe
118,galvanekps,Best of the Bunch,8,2 June 2019,"Not usually a fan of the rom/com genre but this one is a best of. Randall Park and Ali Wong are honest, believable and spot on in their roles. Keanu Reeves adds a self-deprecating cameo that pokes fun at his notoriously nice guy persona. Not even a hint of the gender politics that is usually the foundation of rom/coms and it even manages to stick a finger in the eye of celebrity culture.If you've been starving for decent comedy like us, worth the time to check it out.",Always Be My Maybe

123,godzigodzigodzi,light hearted comedy,6,10 May 2020,"Perfect movie for if you just want something simple and light to watch. It makes you feel good afterwards. Though some parts are a little bit too comic but hey, it's better than the typical rom-com.As an asian myself, i love the little details (what i like to call ""subtle asian traits"") portrayed in the movie so naturally; such as removing shoes before entering a house, eating spam with rice, or proving love by not using the ""family discount"" card even though it's ingrained in our souls to do whatever we can to save money hahaha. I also love the display of interesting juxtaposition between the asian all our parents want (rich, classy like Sasha) and hippie, go-with-the-flow asian like Marcus and Jenny (i'm also surprised at how chill Marcus' dad is)I could write about some questionable parts about why i can't give this movie a 10 out of 10--i dont want to say it's problematic, but it's just something that bugs me. But then, don't think too much like me and just watch it for what it is; a fun, light hearted rom-com movie with asian-american rep",Always Be My Maybe
124,TrickyladyGames,Average,8,2 January 2021,"Just the average romance movie that's highly predictable and a little unrealistic.

126,cmandvl,A Familiar Dish of Romantic Comedy But A Favorite All The Same,7,31 May 2019,"I wanted to watch this movie after seeing the trailer on Youtube. I finally opened my own Netflix account specially to see this film (after using friends and family's accounts for years. :-D).I enjoy romcoms and this one is your typical piece! But it is still fresh! I guess I can sum this movie up to this analogy:It's like ordering your favorite dish at a restaurant. You know what to expect, but it still doesn't make it any less good or enjoyable.(SPOILERS*****)...First, let me get the negatives out of the way in a quick list:-Not enough Daniel Kim. Seriously, they wasted so much handsomeness. But he did a good job playing the jerk boyfriend. Not going to lie :-D.-A little rushed. I wish they would have spent more time in the beginning with more scenes that showed how these two were childhood and teenage friends. However, the scene which makes them become distant from one another was carried out very well!Ok, end of negatives. Now onto the positives!My favorite moments were definitely the scenes with Keanu. It was hilarious to watch Randall and him fight. My favorite character was Vivian Bang as Jen. Her and Keanu Reeves' characters ""vibes"" and ""wave lengths"" were on 100. (In the best possible way :-D).(CAUTION NSFW****)The sexy/romantic moments were also surprisingly HOT!! From when Ali and Randall had that awkward moment in the back of the car, to their kiss in the Uber rideshare (which had me WEAK with laughter), to the steamy scene at Ali's house when freaking Randall LIFTED HER UP AND CARRIED HER TO THE BED (my jaw dropped when he took off his shirt hehe :-D). Also, ALI WONG in a freaking bed scene was so beautiful and HOT. I felt like I was there next to her, falling in love with her, too as she and Randall had the ""after glow"" moment hehe.(END NSFW****)
Of course the absolute BEST part of this movie was Ali and Randall's charisma. Especially together. I believed in their story and characters. I really just enjoyed watching them. I hope they continue to work on more starring role projects and together as well.Overall this was a fun romantic comedy! 7/10!",Always Be My Maybe

129,williamsteenstra,Better than Bill and Ted,10,5 June 2019,"I'm halfway through this movie, it's up there with 'All about Steve' and 'Watching the Detectives'. Keanu's always been one of those people who keeps a straight face so it's always hard to get a sense of his personality but his scenes in this really show his humour. The main characters have strong personalities but are very likeable, Ali Wong and Randal Park perform very well, and the supporting characters/actors are a great fit.

The fact that the cast is centered on an Asian American couple is different compared to other cliched rom-coms, but it was still executed remarkably well and authentically as a crucial element of the story. There were an abundance of hilarious scenes, especially the ones where Keanu Reeves made an appearance, but there were also those serious scenes that made you ask yourself what exactly you're doing with your own life.

144,Piixie88,Cute lighthearted rom com,7,9 June 2019,"If you are looking for an overly romantic movie then stop and dont watch it. This is not ""The Notebook"" type of movie with big displays of love and affection.I think that's the good thing about this movie. It's more down to earth and what I think to be more believable to how most relationships are. Not that there isn't any relationships where you can experience great romance and incredible, once in a lifetime things happen. But reality is most relationships aren't like that. The romance is more subtle, there will be awkward moments you will argue, get jealous and actually hurt people you like/love with things you said.This movie doesnt have a plot that is aiming for an academy award. It's simply a funny rom-com about two childhood friends who lost touch and found each other again 16 years later. which I personally found cute, laughed watching it and took my mind off things. If you like romantic comedies, I think you should give this one a try. If you don't like it, simply take it off and onto the next movie. That's the beauty of the film industry, so many movies to fit everyone's different tastes.Oh yeah, I before I forget.... loved seeing Keanu Reeves acting like the total opposite of how many people say he really is.",Always Be My Maybe

150,MahMahOne,"Lovely, Fresh, Diversity",10,11 June 2019,It is wonderful to see Netflix invest in vehicles like this.

151,IAAL,Pleasant enough but straight out of the RomComOMatic,7,19 July 2019,"A romantic comedy with decent enough acting (Michelle Buteau, in a supporting role, nearly runs away with the movie), a decent enough script, and no surprises whatsoever. There's a bit of pretty good food porn in the manner of ""Babette's Feast"" or ""The Big Night,"" and about the same amount of fun-poking at modern over-the-top culinary excesses -- which, it must be said, is a pretty easy target for that sort of thing, but they do a nice job. The plot is about as credible as rom-com plots ever are; as with most of them, it frequently reminded me of the Onion article ""Romantic-Comedy Behavior Gets Real-Life Man Arrested."" But that's ok; that's what we expect. Real people don't fake orgasms in crowded Manhattan delis, either, but we suspend our disbelief. Nature of the genre.I should add that this movie could have been called ""Crossing Park Presidio,"" that being the major San Francisco street separating the neighborhood where Sasha and Marcus grew up from downtown. This is approximately a remake of, and very likely a homage to, ""Crossing Delancey,"" with Asians standing in for Jews and the high-end restaurant scene standing in for the high-end literary scene. That's not necessarily a bad thing; ""Crossing Delancey"" is one of my favorite rom-coms ever. But I was really struck by a lot of the parallels.",Always Be My Maybe

Virtually every other group and sub-group has been represented.Asian-Americans continue to be left out and overlooked for leading roles, supporting roles, ancillary roles.Even when an Asian-American is cast in a recurring role (i.e. ""Modern Family""), their part is typically a mute part, devoid of lines ... and any apparent purpose.

Why is this film so awful?The chemistry between the two leads is non-existent throughout the film and they're more or less awkward around each other making the film difficult to watch. There isn't anything original here in terms of the plot, it's your stereotypical girl grows up with boy, life gets in the way and they lose touch only to meet sixteen years later and have their flame reignite.But like honestly, we can sweep all this to one side - Marcus is the definition of toxic masculinity and a man who thinks the world and its women owe him. Why then do the filmmakers feel Sasha should give him a second chance and build her life with him? Marcus is the kind of guy who will drag anyone down with him. He's that kind of loser.",Always Be My Maybe

177,Galvant,It's a Rom-Com with Asians,7,30 July 2019,"""Always Be My Maybe"" directed by Nahnatchka Khan starting Ali Wong and Randall Park is a standard Romantic Comedy but starting Asian actors. I saw on Rotten Tomatoes that it was rated 93 fresh and a lot of the reviews stated that it really brought to life the Asian American story. I enjoyed it; it's a nice casual watch and it's not too long nor does it require much thinking or active engagement. I loved the cast; strong performances from most of the cast. Standout for me were Marcus's Father played by James Saito. Many people raved about Keanu Reeves' exaggerated caricature; personally, while I thought it was entertaining at first, his character got a bit too aggressive near the end of his time. One criticism I had was that the music was all over the place, especially during transition scenes. I think they could've toned some of the songs choices down so they weren't so upfront and in your face. My final thoughts are that I wish the Burger King scene came back later in the movie as a reference to tie it full circle. Also Marcus never actually apologized for saying ""But she was my mom not yours"".",Always Be My Maybe

205,thedevereauxbunch,Most enjoyable lighthearted movie I've watched in ages,9,2 June 2019,"Rom-Coms have become a little too predictable. Not the fact they get together - you know that's coming - but the steps from opening scene to closing credits. I especially hate when Rom-Coms feel the lead have to go through an unrealistic 'all is lost' moment. This one wasn't unrealistic, and the pair actually got to explain a little bit of what they were feeling, which is far more realistic than something stupid happening and one of the pair giving up. It reminded me, although not in the same league (sorry Randall) of When Harry Met Sally's 'all is lost moment'. You understood the reasons and it wasn't a misheard comment or contrived rumour which made it happen. I enjoyed this so much. This might annoy Randall Park, so I'm going to apologise right up front despite not meaning it as anything but a good thing, but he reminds me of Ryan Reynolds: both his voice and jokes and delivery. So by both I clearly meant three things. Great film and a perfect fit in the genre. I'd have given it 10 but...you now....When Harry Met Sally.",Always Be My Maybe
206,anonymouscontent-14248,"Contrived, narcissitic, and uninspired",1,23 June 2019,"I really wanted to like this film as a bunch of my friends and good marketing hyped it up so I sat on my couch and tuned into Netflix for a cozy feel good Saturday night hoping for something different...I love romcoms and they aren't hard to make passable when you have heart, but this one was dry, I mean really, really dry. At the very least one should walk out of a rom com with some lingering feelings for the connection felt between the characters or some warm fuzzy endearing moments. This film was barren and souless. I was not invested in any of the characters.They took a bunch of cliche recognizable plot devices and put them together with self centred underdeveloped characters, self indulgent actors, and terrible writing. Two people have sex in a car. They are awkward about it in a very forced way. They look at each other awkwardly. A bunch of cheesy (pun intended) pointless dialogue is delivered with an equally meaningless delivery from the actors. Why should I care? Why does this matter. The characters all lack chemistry and charisma and the acting is poor and narcissitic. If it were at least giving some heart or investment to the audience, I would have felt emotions, but no it was just - empty.The writing was the second worst part to the acting. It's like the writers wrote in parentheses ""insert funny dialogue here"" and then thought of the least creative, underwhelming dialogue one could think of in order to make it to the next scene transition. The dialogue and acting didn't inform the characters and more importantly didn't inform the relationship and heart between the connection of other characters if one were to ever exist.The music and scoring. The opening music conveys a different theme to the entire feature. Why is all the music black music and all the characters chinese? Jordan Peele had it right in ""Get Out"" when he talked about the complacency and racism of South East Asians/Azns appropriating and acting alongside the racism towards POCs. There are tons of black or appropriated black songs throughout, even an Asian girl butchering the lyrics in the car made me cringe (likely all added with intention to raise the energy and emotion lacking throughout the film). Black people? There are two light skinned black people in it (barely) in an otherwise entirely Asian cast. That's not diversity. ""Kim's Convenience"" has diversity, I'll even give it to a much better AZN film; ""To All the Boys I've Loved Before"" for the acting and at least having heart and more on screen diversity. This movie? No diversity, no heart, no soul.",Always Be My Maybe

I watched the trailer and as soon as I saw Randall Park involved as well I was hooked. I loved Randall Park ever since The Interview (yes that movie is my go to comedy) and Fresh off the Boat. This is a Netflix release and iv got to say, the story is a bit on the basic side but I loved it! The story is really carried by its lead with Randall Park and Ali Wong, whenever they are on screen together it really does feel like they have known each other all their lives, so all the romantic scenes really do have a payoff. Keanu Reeves, what can I even say about him at this point? He steals every scene he's in and it really goes to show how versatile he is as an actor, seeing John Wick to his role in this is such a great thing to see. I totally totally recommend this movie, I have seen it three times already and I could watch it a couple more times.

The actors were believable and did a great job. There is even a VERY unexpected and quite hilarious ""cameo"" one would never expect. (I won't spoil the surprise for you!) The movie was already cute, funny and quite enjoyable, but this great cameo really threw it over into an even higher level of enjoyment! So if you enjoy a light hearted, well written and performed romantic comedy, you should catch this one. I'm reading some negative reviews based on the format being predictable. Well, we all know what typically happens (""The Formula"") in romantic comedies. Nonetheless, if the story is well written and the actors performances are solid (as in this case), it can still make for a very good movie. Please make more like this Netflix!

I can legit count on one hand, if is has fingers chopped off, the number of times that my husband has watched a rom-com with me. I'm lukewarm on them, he loathes them.So, ""Always Be My Maybe"" is a cute flick that combines 90s nostalgia, food porn, a great script, actors with great chemistry/delivery, and, for me, wins the award for best use of Keanu Reeves in a small role. It pokes fun of the Hollywood establishment and pop culture, as well as the eccentricities of Asian-American culture. Ali Wong is terrific and her chemistry with Randal Park (who is always wonderful and his rap songs are the best worst thing ever!) is fantastic in this weird, awkward way that feels more genuine than your typical rom-com.Look, man, it's a rom-com, okay.

I won't watch it ever again and ended up fast forwarding a few scenes. Won't be recommending it to anyone. Would have not taken anything away from the story line to leave out all the crude parts.

Certainly not the best rom-com, but you have to appreciate the diverse cast, soundtrack, and story line - a story that hasn't been represented on screen much, if at all. This movie is essentially the Asian-American and/or West Coast version of Brown Sugar (2002), albeit lower budget and production, but still an enjoyable movie that will leave you laughing, reminiscing, and relating to the characters' stories regardless of your background.

Neither of the main leads is likable. They are childhood sweethearts who have drifted apart and now are living completely different and incompatible lifestyles but somehow end up back together. So predictable and so underwhelming. And full of holes. We're expected to believe that the woman, who has loved the man since she was a child, hasn't been in contact for 16 years. It's just unrealistic. The girlfriend Jenny...they made her so unlikeable that there's no way to believe the main character dated her for five months. I'd advise you to find something else...this type of movie has been done 100 times and each of those is better than this. The only reason it got three stars from me is there's a pretty unexpected cameo that totally cracked me up. I won't spoil it in case you don't heed my warning and watch it anyway...",Always Be My Maybe

It's hillarious and ironic at the same time. Keanu Reeves in this movie... best part! If all movies grasped this level of awareness, there would be a lot more hits out there. It's different and playful, while still sort of following an older rom com format. It's a must see.",Always Be My Maybe

Recommended by my sister-in-law, I watched it during a run one morning, as I typically would do with something I'm just so-so interested in. BUT, I ended up being on that treadmill the entire length of the movie. They do such an awesome job of building the characters, the acting is SPOT on, the cameo is HILARIOUS and the plot is perfection. These types of movies all feel like they've been done before, but not this one. Sure, the end may be predictable, but that's what you expect in this type of movie.

I wasn't expecting much. Just put it on as it was the first thing that popped up on the main screen. Maybe some of the jokes are too Asian? One review said the storyline needed lots of work- but again I think that's a cultural thing. I was seeing so much reflected back from beginning to end being born in a country where my parents weren't from. It genuinely had me laughing and crying more than anything in a long while. Thank you so much for making this film and showing how Asians are regular folk in an old fashioned rom com. Also get where women were complying they didn't need dope smoking losers from their past. I didn't see than in the film. What I saw was that men didn't have to be afraid to earn less or be less successful than women.

302,whitmanjs,"A copy of ""Just friends"" but less funny",3,18 June 2019,"Two childhood friends are very close. One is in love with the other. They grow apart and one becomes very successful while the other stays in their home town. Successful friend returns home with their current partner. Over the course of their return, they fall in love with childhood friend again and end their relationship with their current partner.
This synopsis descripes this movie and the 2005 film ""just friends"" starring Ryan Reynolds, Amy Smart, and Anna Ferris. The only difference is that the genders we're swapped.
Aside from the unoriginal story, the comedy was bland and the pacing was awful. The writing was fine (even the parts that weren't copied seemed to be uninteresting and uninspired) but the directing is what killed it. The two main actors did good with what they were given and made me believe they were real people for most of the movie.SPOILERS!!: This movie falls victim to the predictable narrative of the two main characters being mad at each other for a small portion of the movie. Everything is going great and out of nowhere Randall Park's character just starts acting out and being a jerk to Ali Wong's character. They give a reason as to why he acts this way but no real person would take it to this extent in real life.
All in all, the movie isn't great but the two main characters are portrayed by likable enough actors to prevent this movie from being a 2/10. The main characters parents have bad actors and I wish they were in less of the movie.
This movie gets two stars for the high production quality and another star because of the two main actors.

He is very rude, selfish, hurts Sasha's feeling over and over again for no reason, and he can't even get his own life together without Sasha's help.
Compared to that Sasha is successful, hard-working, famous, celebrity chef. She deserves someone so much better than Marcus.
I could not follow why Sasha could not get over loving Marcus that in the end I basically skipped the parts where they kissed or slept together.
I think I know what kind of movie they wanted to make. They wanted a movie that is filled with Korean food, warm, family and childhood friends getting married like in fairytales. But fairytale princess are not that poor or so rude.
Marcus being rude was not funny it just made me cringe and say what is wrong with him. Worst male character ever for romantic comedy.",Always Be My Maybe

Although I do agree some of the scenes were a tad awkward due to lack of chemistry, the real gem behind the movie is the portrayal of a first generation Asian American story that is 100% relatable. There were so many instances and inside jokes that were so subtle yet pure gold. Albeit, they very well could have gone over people's heads if you haven't seen it growing up. Also, the fact that she's a chef and the underlying theme is FOOD, come on, it's homage to Asian/Asian American culture.",Always Be My Maybe

It was cringe and a waste of time. No chemistry between the main actors, and especially Ali wong is so unlikable and bitter you cant really cheer for her character at all. The technical issues are there obviously aswell, it went over the worst editing (especially the moment after the break up, the whole movie went downhill) and the script.. the dialougues where so basic, yet they couldnt be delivered.",Always Be My Maybe

Park is always a fun sarcastic voice delivery. But, Wong surprises with a well done performance given that I've only seen her in stand up.

However, the cast chemistry, setting and style (think 90s hip hop in Cali), humor, and the abundance of Asian actors (including Keanu Reeves) makes for an enjoyable movie. Had me feeling nostalgic for that puppy love feeling in my teenage years. This is kind of irrelevant, but Mariah Carey's song perfectly fits the story as well.

340,xamyc75,Ugh!,3,14 November 2019,"I'm sorry, but I don't know what everyone sees in this film.
I love the premise of an all Asian lead; I know that that is rare enough. I also love that Sasha is a strong independent woman and doesn't need a man; Young women need more of those. I liked Sasha's character, and I thought their childhood romance was sweet.
I can't however see anything of worth in Marcus at all. Everything he did made me cringe. It's not his job, because a man's worth is not his job. It's not his lack of ambition, although that's part of it. It's that he doesn't seem to have a single redeemable quality about him. He's jealous, he's needy and he's not a nice guy.
Keanu Reeve's appearance was unexpected, but just weird. I'm a big Keanu fan, but I thought this one was just about being weird for the sake of being weird. Perhaps, I am missing out on some Hollywood parody, but I was singularly unimpressed by his character.

This was gold.

The story does nothing special, nor does the music, or the camera, or anything. Some jokes were funny (specially in the Keanu Reeves part), but it doesn't save the excuse of a movie this is.

The two then navigate their vastly different lifestyles and re-discover their affection for each other. Shot in San Francisco and makes you feel right at home in the Golden City.

356,arro253,Decent rom-com but weak romance and understanding of humam behavior,6,6 June 2019,"There were a few laughs and there's a nice feel-good factor in here. Ali Wong and Keanu Reeves were great, as well.However, in certain parts, the characters' actions were so over the top, creating a drastic change in tone that broke immersiveness in the 'romance' of the story.I didn't believe in the great love or even friendship between the two leads because a long relationship like that is more than a few jokes and one sexual encounter. There was no sense of them having been through a lot together or knowing each other's unique quirks or talking about big life stuff and finding out each other's values.Also, one part at the end surprised me by being construed as a romantic gesture on Ali Wong's part. I am sure that most people in real life would be angry and upset that what they thought was their business booming turned out to be a loved one secretly throwing money at the problem.While I can see Ali Wong's character as being an amazing; desirable woman, Randall Park's character came off as immature to the point of being selfish and mean-spirited, hence not likeable or attractive.His 'growth' and realization at the end felt like too little, too late. It came off as a man who seemed to do a one-eighty because he had nothing else in his life anyway, rather than someone who grew into himself and finally realised he appreciated her.",Always Be My Maybe

362,nelso-48987,A classic original romcom,8,6 July 2019,"A solid take on the genre with two knock out leads who carry the film with their charm.

Sad that I wasted my time on this one. Don't mind a predictable movie, but at least try to devellop a proper storyline. Why they would fall in love in the present is absolutely not clear. Yes, they have history. But as a succesfull and smart woman that would not be enough reason to date the sad town guy who had zero personal development in 16 years. Can't believe people are actually willing to invest that much money in such an awful movie.

For what it's worth, it is one of the best I've seen for a pretty long time.Characters are fun, somhow grounded in a relative reality that makes this a not so serious movie. The cheezyness is deserved and amusing. Both main actors have a good chemistry wich makes the whole story believable in a basic way.I wouldn't say it's memorable, but if your significant other makes you watch it, you'll be less bored than the average movie of that genre usually leaves you.But it's a predictable, ordinary structured movie that leaves no element of surprise. The script is pretty much as valuable as the other movie in that genre, wich is an big pile of averageness. Clichés are all over and are sometimes eye rolling, taking the viewer out of the experience.Mostly, it fullfills it's purpose by beeing light hearted and sweet, leaving an expected but enjoyable smile on your face.
