0,Leofwine_draca,"The more things change, the more they stay the same",5,6 April 2011,"While I'm a big fan of the first two PREDATOR movies, I thought the two recent ALIEN VS PREDATOR flicks were rubbish: badly made, ill-conceived cash-ins on not one but two separate film series. When I heard Robert Rodriguez was producing a new sequel to PREDATOR, I was delighted; after all, I like Rodriguez and think his films (such as PLANET TERROR) are a hoot.Sadly, PREDATORS turns out to be ""same old"" rather than something new. It's as if every decent scene or idea from the Schwarzenegger film was borrowed and reshot to fit into this one. Once again, we're thrown into the middle of the jungle (on an alien planet this time, not that it matters) with a group of survivors who are picked off one by one (this short movie does away with any back story and literally begins by dropping the stars onto the trees). The big draw is that there are multiple predators rather than just one, but when it turns out there are three tops, and rarely more than one involved in an action scene, I couldn't help but be disappointed. It's as if the scriptwriter took a potentially great premise and just copied what's been done before rather than coming up with anything new or remotely original.Brody is a bit of a bore as the brooding hero, failing to deliver any of the charisma that Schwarzenegger and Glover brought to their versions. Russian Arnie shoe-in Oleg Taktarov is better, but as is the case with Danny Trejo and Laurence Fishburne, he's wasted in a small supporting role. Too much time is spent with bland characters, like Topher Grace's doctor, and the script's wearying insistence on having human villains in the cast, as if the predators themselves weren't enough of a threat. The special effects are decent and the direction isn't half bad, but what a sequel this could have been if it didn't cover the same old ground...",Predators
1,SnoopyStyle,Worthy sequel to 87 original,7,6 October 2013,"This is a strip down predator movie. A group of disparate tough people are parachuted off into an alien world. There isn't much of a setup. They find themselves being hunted by predators.This one stars Adrien Brody, Topher Grace, Alice Braga, Walton Goggins, Danny Trejo, and Laurence Fishburne. Fishburne's character is a bit of a missed opportunity. There are other actors who could play crazy better.Even though Robert Rodriguez didn't direct this, it's got many of his touches. And it's a worthy sequel to '87 original. It's definitely better than all the Predator versus Alien movies. It's even better than the 1990 sequel.",Predators
2,claudio_carvalho,Predictable but Entertaining Sequel,6,9 October 2010,"The mercenary Royce (Adrien Brody); the military Isabelle (Alice Braga); the Russian soldier Nikolai (Oleg Taktarov); the San Quentin criminal Stans (Walton Goggins); the Serra Leoa militia Mombasa (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali); the drug lord Cuchillo (Danny Trejo); the Yakuza Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien); and the Doctor Edwin (Topher Grace) awake in free fall but they succeed to open their parachutes landing in a jungle. Sooner they discover that they are in another planet and they are preys of aliens in a deadly hunting game, and they need to join forces to destroy their predators and survive.""Predators"" is a predictable but entertaining sequel of the 1987 film. The plot is not original and the story begins like in ""Cube"" (1997) with a group of skilled strangers trapped in a jungle without knowledge about where they are and what is happening. Adrien Brody is full of steroids performing a mercenary, but this role of action hero (or anti-hero) does not fit well to his profile. The Brazilian Alice Braga surprises in the role of a military and the rest of the cast have good performances. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Predadores"" (""Predators"")",Predators
3,kosmasp,Natural Born ... Hunters,7,23 October 2010,"The movies Robert Rodriguez did, that were aimed for an adult audience always worked, so even though it wasn't him making the picture, but ""only"" being the producer, you'd expect this to be really good. And as far as the action goes, it is pretty good. Although the whole setting does render the first Predator almost obsolete (or makes the first group of humans look like wimps, considering them only having one foe) ... but that's only if you think too much about it.And think about it, you shouldn't. Especially not about a scene (cameo?) of an actor with the initials L.F. His appearance is completely out of nowhere and feels more than weird. And while that was intended it still is not in sync with the rest of the (tone of the) movie. But maybe I'm thinking too much again. Not that there is too much to think about, or a big story behind it all. It's action, so try to enjoy it (it's better shot than those Alien vs. Predator movies for one ...), if you can! :o)",Predators
4,classicsoncall,"""We're gonna need a new plan"".",7,17 October 2015,"Right out of the gate, the movie disorients the viewer with Adrien Brody's free fall out of nowhere, and it takes a few minutes to figure out that he and his erstwhile companions have been snatched from their own world to provide a trophy hunt for the title creatures. Some new information is provided here about the Predator race, adapting every new hunting season to the latest threat posed by man and his capacity for intelligence and massive firepower. I don't know that I would have picked Brody to be the team leader in an action adventure but he seems to make it work, especially at the point when he reveals that set of ripped abs. I had to wonder if that was an enhanced image or not.After the initial introductions though, the film moves on to pretty much an exercise in fierce jungle battle and the obligatory winnowing of the human warriors. If you've seen enough of these types of films, you can figure out who the last man (and woman) standing will be, and so it's left to see how creative the film makers are in killing off it's victims. It's a time honored tradition in pictures dating back to at least 1932's ""The Most Dangerous Game"", and creatively done, the concept is sure to pop up again.One thing I got a kick out of were those tricked out Predator attack dogs; they reminded me of a 1959 flick titled ""The Killer Shrews"". In that one, a number of folks stranded on an island were hunted down by a pack of wild canines with a serious hair gone wrong problem, and if they had the technology back then, those 'shrews' might have looked something like the mutant beasts here. Who knows, given another fifty years, the creatures on display here might look pretty tame by comparison as well.",Predators
5,jboothmillard,Predators,4,13 July 2010,"First there was one with Arnold Schwarzenegger, then there were many in Los Angeles, and most recently they battled with the Aliens, and now comes this next sequel, from director Nimród Antal (Vacancy). Basically it is meant to be twenty three years since the events of the first film, and in an unidentified jungle a bunch of elite warriors have been dropped in there. They all stick together and go through the jungle carrying the weapons they have at hand and try to find some sort of civilisation, but their location is quite a shock. They know that they are on an alien planet, it is just a question of how to get off it, and away from the terrifying alien creatures known only as the Predators. Royce (Adrien Brody), Edwin (Spider-Man 3's Topher Grace), Isabelle (Alice Braga) and the rest of the ""team"" realise that they have all been chosen to be in this special alien style game reserve to be hunted, and they briefly meet up with Noland (Laurence Fishburne) who has been there for years. Eventually they decide the only way to get off the planet is to take the Predator ship, and a tied up Predator may be the only one that can help, but there are two breeds of Predator, and they don't like each other. Also starring Walton Goggins as Stans, Oleg Taktarov as Nikolai, Danny Trejo as Cuchillo, Louis Ozawa Changchien as Hanzo, Carey Jones as Tracker Predator / Falconer Predator, Brian Steele as Berzerker Predator and Derek Mears as Classic Predator. I'm afraid to say that this film was almost exactly the same as the first Predator film, it had the same music, it had the Billy sacrificing himself style moment, it had the injured person to drag moment, it had the falling over a cliff into water moment, and it had the ""come one, kill me"" moment. If it wasn't for the similarities to the superior (to all the sequels) film, it might be a bit more entertaining, there were some good bloody and action moments I suppose, but yeah, not great. Okay!",Predators
6,Tweekums,Decent enough action but fairly predictable,7,9 December 2012,"We are introduced to protagonist Royce as he wakes up to find himself in freefall over a jungle; his parachute deploys just in time. Once on the ground we learn that seven other people all arrived in the same way at the same time. They are a mixed group consisting of Royce, a mercenary, a military sniper, a member of the Russian Special Forces, a Sierra Leonean rebel, a Mexican cartel enforcer, a man who was on death row, a Yakuza and a doctor. They are armed with whatever they were carrying at the time they picked up and none of them know how they came to fall into the jungle. As they don't know each other there are inevitably problems with trust but as time passes they come to work as a team. Before too long they realise something else is in the jungle with them; deadly predators that are hunting them for sport!This film can be considered a sequel to the original Schwarzenegger vehicle as it references that film directly but makes no mention of the events in LA in 'Predator 2'; it is also, to a degree, a remake. Instead of a crack military unit we have a group made up of people whose lives involved killed; military and criminal... it is a mystery why nobody wonders what a doctor is doing there though! The fact that they didn't previously know each other means there is no camaraderie between the characters like in the original which is a pity; it also lacks the pithy one-liners. The action is solid enough and in places moderately gory; nothing really shocking though. The cast does a pretty good job for the most part; the choice of Adrien Brody to play Royce was good as he is nothing like Arnie and Alice Braga was good as the only woman in the group. While not one of the main cast; Lawrence Fishburne put in a nice turn as the survivor of a previous hunt. There are a few twists; it is fun when we learnt were they actually were... or rather weren't... Earth, Fishburne's betrayal wasn't a huge surprise but worked; sadly the final 'twist' was so obvious I'm sure most people will have seen it coming when they learnt what the characters had done on Earth. It is equally likely that viewers will guess who the survivors will be long before the end; the only mystery was how the others would die and in what order. The effects were pretty good; I especially liked the use of the dog-predators. Overall it passed the time well enough and fans of the Predator Franchise can now pretend the two 'Alien vs. Predator' films never existed!",Predators
7,ma-cortes,Exciting and thrilling motion picture in which a varied group must fight evil aliens in a dangerous jungle,7,30 July 2013,"Moving Sci-Fi film with plenty of action , chills , thrills and resulting to be pretty entertaining ; including some resemblances to original film . It deals with a group of elite warriors are hunted by members of a merciless alien race known as Predators . They are Royce (Adrien Brody , Nimród Antal specifically chose him for the main protagonist); the Israeli soldier Isabelle (Alice Braga , she is the third brunette actress who appears in the ""Predator"" series, following Elpidia Carrillo and Maria Conchita Alonso) ; the Chechenian soldier Nikolai (Oleg Taktarov , who hit his face on a Steadicam camera and started bleeding , he insisted that filming continued to add effect to the scene); the San Quentin criminal Stans (Walton Goggins who along with other actors did their own stunts in the cliff fall scene); the Serra Leoa militia Mombasa (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali); the drug lord Cuchillo (Danny Trejo , Robert Rodriguez's usual); the Yakuza Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien); and the Doctor Edwin (Topher Grace) awake and they encounter an alien force that begin to attack one by one . The group has to confront nearly invisible aliens , even over an eight-foot-tall with an armoury of sophisticated weapons that tear apart . As aliens dispatch comrades before the impressive final showdown .This nail-biting picture contains action-packed from start to finish , gory scenes aplenty , thrills , emotion and entertainment . Action movie told in terms of jungle warfare in which a misfit bunch formed by strange roles battle malicious extraterrestrials . This is a brutal , violent and exciting sci-fi thriller that scales new heights of savagery even by the standards of previous Predator films . The result is a throughly violent but undeniably thrilling action movie with a strong cast giving sweatily good value to their abrasive characters . The ending part is particularly exciting stuff though it makes no great sense . Excellent makeup by professional experts , Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger , and magnificent FX , especially the semi-invisibility which is very well realized . Thrilling and suspenseful musical score by John Debney (Sin City) ; Debney was quoted as saying that his score will be influenced by Silvestri's original score for the 1987 film . In fact , the final credit is heard the classical soundtrack by Alan Silvestri from Predator I . Colorful cinematography but sometimes dark , although all the main locations were filmed in Hawaii, 60% of the movie was shot in Texas in order to be eligible for a tax benefit . The motion picture shot in 53 days was well directed by Nimrod Antal though Neil Marshall, Michael J. Bassett, Bill Duke, Marcus Nispel, Peter Berg and Darren Lynn Bousman were considered to direct the film. In the end, Nimród Antal was hired because Robert Rodriguez enjoyed Antal's earlier films ¨Kontroll¨ and ¨Vacancy¨ .Other film about Predator series are the following : The original and the best ¨Predator¨ (1987) in which Arnold leads a team of CIA-hired mercenaries into the Central American jungles , being filmed by John McTiernan with Arnold Schwarzanegger , Jesse Ventura , Bill Duke , R.G. Armstrong , Carl Weathers ; ¨Predator 2¨(1990) in which the alien has inexplicably returned to L.A , being directed by Stephen Hopkins with Danny Glover , Bill Paxton , Ruben Blades , Maria Conchita Alonso and Gary Busey . Furthermore, ¨Alien vs. Predator¨ (2004) by Paul Anderson with Sanaa Lathan , Raoul Bova , Lance Henriksen , Colin Salmon , Tommy Flannagan and ¨Aliens vs. Predator 2¨ (2007) by Strause Brothers with Steven Pasquale , Reiko Aylesworth , John Ortiz , Johnny Lewis and Robert Joy .",Predators
8,BA_Harrison,Pred-ictable.,5,11 November 2010,"Several strangers, each well versed in armed combat, find themselves dropped into a dense jungle where they are pursued by Predators, a race of extraterrestrials who hunt alien life-forms for sport.As much as I enjoy seeing Predators do their thing, this attempt by 20th Century Fox to reboot its popular sci-fi/action franchise does nothing to change my opinion that the dread-locked hunters should have hung up their triangulating, shoulder-mounted laser blasters for good when AVP: Requiem failed to impress the majority of viewers.It's not that Predators is a terrible movie, per se, but rather that it has nothing new to offer fans, the basic plot (by Robert Rodriguez) simply retreading territory covered over two decades ago in the still unrivalled original Schwarzeneggar classic. Director Nimród Antal's replication of key scenes from the first film only serves to irritate and matters aren't helped much by his raft of particularly unappealing characters (as opposed to Arnie's likable Dutch and his impossibly macho pals), a dreadfully miscast Adrien Brody as lead tough guy Royce, and a seriously dumb 'twist' towards the end.",Predators
9,paul_haakonsen,Boiling soup on a meatless bone...,5,12 July 2010,"Well, it seems that the Alien and Predator franchise is sort of being milked for every penny that is possible. And this latest installment in the Predator series is somewhat of a let down. (It was for me, at least!)First, let me say that this movie is not boring in any way. Lots of nice action scenes and a constant pace from start till end. But it was a weak story and it was something that the series could have done without. There was nothing spectacular or any new thinking in the movie. And there was something missing, that particular something to make the movie unique.If you liked the first two Predator movies, then you will find this movie enjoyable as well, but for me personally, this third installment didn't quite reach up to the level of the previous two movies.As for the actors and actresses, well, they did a good job. However, I think that Topher Grace was sort of miscast for a role in a movie like this. Hear me out, his acting is good, no question about it. But he is just not cut out for a role in a sci-fi action movie. Despite their small roles, it was cool to see Laurence Fishburne and Danny Trejo in the movie.The effects in the movie were good, nothing to put a finger on here. And the scenery was good as well. Though I kind of would have liked to see a more alien-world touch to this distant planet. That would have brought the movie up a notch. And for some reason, the plant life on this planet is the same as on Earth? Alrighty then... Anyway, the CGI effects were cool to behold as well, and the newly introduced predator hounds were as nice touch as well.As always, the predators are cool to look at, with lots of nice touches and details. But it isn't enough to keep this movie afloat. I had expected more from this movie, but I wasn't bored, just a tad disappointed. Looking past that, then the ""Predators"" movie is an alright sci-fi action movie. Just watch it for what it is.",Predators
10,Quinoa1984,"an example of a good sequel, though not a great one",6,19 July 2010,"Nimrod Antal is a competent director of B movies. At least, that's how he's proved himself so far (last year's little neo-noir Armored), and Predators continues his streak of work in that area. This time he takes an assignment from Robert Rodriguez, who only produces (and did an uncredited write of the script), and his work here is just... fine. Nothing too special, a good eye for action, and knows what made the original Predator work so well and translates that into this new film, which has a group of various mercenaries and criminals plopped into 'The Most Dangerous Game' with predators on an unknown planet.What is so special about the film? Well, that may depend on how much of a fan you are of the original film (and whether or not you're die-hard about one film or about those pesky sequels with the Aliens). I liked the original, and it pumpsup the blood of any masculine man's heart when watching such guys like Arnold and Carl Weathers and Jesse Ventura out in the jungle fighting a big beast a mask and heat-seeking goggles. That film, and to a lesser extent this one, just did what it needed to do for its audience: give some tense action and some characters who have no choice but to eat grit and fire guns for all they're worth.Where this film might falter is in some expectability, and some cliché in the script. Only one big misfire happens in the story, and its due in part to the writing of a character and its actor, Laurence Fishburne as ""the one that got away"", a scavenger from a seasons-before 'game'. He comes in and does a jerky little performance until he (spoilers) betrays everyone. But it doesn't really have much consequence; you could take him out of the film and not really lose too much of the narrative (there's also another double-cross, also expected, but at least it provides a few good scene-chewing scenes with the certain actor). On-screen Adrian Brody gets to do a solid Clint Eastwood impression, Alice Braga looks good to look at, Danny Trejo needed more screen time, and Topher Grace acts much the same as he did in Spiderman 3. How you like or dislike him the movie depends on what you think of Spiderman 3.There's also some silly scenes, but these actually help, not hurt, what is otherwise a nifty but routine sci-fi adventure meant mostly for the fans. One of which involves a Yakuza, who is the quiet one among the group of mercenaries, and his sword-wielding face-off against a Predator. It's probably the one scene that really had me legitimately on the edge of my seat, even if I was knowing how it should be really stupid. Other silly moments like Brody none-too-subtly going ""I'M HERE KILL ME! DO IT NOW!"" covered in mud made me laugh, but I don't think that was the intention. It's a self-knowing B-movie blockbuster that is almost as tough as the original, but lacking a certain spark the original had in the script and the performance. The best one can say is it's worth watching way before watching Predator 2 or the AVP movies.",Predators
11,Coventry,"At last, a worthy successor for Arnie's jungle classic!",7,25 July 2010,"John McTiernan's ""Predator"", starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, is one of the rather few genuine Sci-Fi/action milestones of the 1980's and – like I suppose the case with most fans – it literally hurt me to see the franchise deteriorate with stuff like ""Alien Vs. Predator"". The initial rumors regarding this belated sequel left me rather skeptical, but those sentiments quickly vanished when I read the project would be helmed by no less than Robert Rodriguez. The man is an authentic cinematic junkie, who does everything the old-fashioned way and glorifies extreme violence like very few other directors can. If anyone was ever going to continue the series, I'm glad it was him. Eventually Robert Rodriguez didn't direct himself (protégé Nimrod Antal did), but his input is clearly noticeable throughout the entire production. Twenty years after the big city sequel, we're back in the jungle, but not the same Guatemalan jungle where Arnie and his fellow commandos opposed the original Predator. Place of action this time is a distant planet, specifically designed as hunting domain for the extraterrestrial predators to practice their favorite sport. The film opens with Adrien Brody and seven others literally being dropped from the sky. They're all carefully selected professional warriors, with the exception of one outcast, varying from patriotic soldiers to mercenaries and convicted serial killers. The group quickly figures out they were abducted and dropped on this planet to serve as preys and opponents for three vicious predators. Perhaps ""Predators"" didn't blew me away like I initially expected (or hoped) but it's undoubtedly splendid summer blockbuster fun, with outrageous action and loads of spectacular stunts. There's quite a bit of illogicality in the script, but it's plain obvious that Robert Rodriguez and his team weren't aiming to win Academy Awards here. The Predators look even more awesome as they did twenty years ago and apparently there exist three subcategories now; namely the classic, the tracker and the berserker. The casting choices are remarkable to say the least. There were everybody was expecting a beefcake action here to follow in Schwarzenegger's mighty footsteps, like Vin Diesel or Jason Statham, Rodriguez opted for method actor Adrien Brody. He's excellent, though, and receives good support from a largely unknown cast including Oleg Taktarov, Walton Goggins and Alice Braga. There are cool, smaller appearances for Danny Trejo and Laurence Fishburne (as a long-term and gradually nuttier survivor on the planet).",Predators
12,michaelRokeefe,This is a volatile sequel worth its own acclaim.,8,22 August 2016,"Nimrod Antal directs this Alien Sci-Fi sequel to PREDATOR (1987) and you will be enthralled with intrigue and suspense, because this is a creature feature that requires both eyes open. Seven strangers are dropped into a rugged jungle-like forest; each waking free fall as their parachutes open in the tree tops. A mercenary named Royce (Adrinn Brody) and a group featuring a Russian soldier, an unassuming doctor, a San Quinton prisoner, a Mexican drug figure, a mysterious Japanese, Sierra Leone soldier and a military trained female figure out they have been placed on another planet as prey for predators that can make themselves invisible. They think they have found a human ally; but can they even trust each other? They do agree that there has to be a way to survive what is chasing them.

13,hitchcockthelegend,They can hear you. Smell you. They see you.,7,15 July 2010,"Predators is directed by Nimród Antal and stars Adrien Brody, Topher Grace, Alice Braga, Laurence Fishburne, Oleg Taktarov & Danny Trejo. It's co-produced out of 20th Century Fox by Robert Rodriguez, John Davis & Elizabeth Avellan, with writing credits going to Michael Finch, Alex Litvak and Jim & John Thomas. It's shot on location in the Hawaiian jungle with Gyula Pados on cinematography, while John Debney reworks Alan Silvestri's score from the 1987 film Predator.The plot sees eight former members of Earth - mercenaries, soldiers, criminals and a doctor, who are literally dropped into a jungle on an alien planet. Why or how they got there is not known, but pretty soon it is apparent they must work together for they are being hunted by an unseen enemy. Hunted, it seems, for sport.In 1987 John McTierrnan gave the movie world Predator, a ballsy Vietnam allegory that pitted Arnold Schwarzenegger and a host of other considerably sized beefcakes against one bad ass mandible wearing alien hunter. Since then the franchise has steadily got worse (though the Danny Glover led sequel is far from a disaster), reaching a crushingly bad nadir with Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem in 2007. Enter Robert Rodriguez who in the mid 90s had done a treatment for a Predator sequel - with Schwarzenegger in mind to return. However, it didn't happen and it's only now, with the franchise at rock bottom, that his script has been reworked and funded to give us Predators, the sequel to McTiernan's 87 ball buster.The set up is a little different but in truth the formula is exactly the same as the original movie. Macho guys and a girl in the jungle are being hunted by something very bad. Alpha male, though, is not going to take it lying down, cue deaths, explosions and much macho posturing. Here in is the main problem with Antal' s movie, it's ticking the same boxes whilst homaging for all it's worth, which is fine since it's hugely entertaining in that Saturday night popcorn way. But there's little to no braveness in the writing. Sure there's some bonuses in the form of alien pets, a predator feud arc and a bonkers midsection with the introduction of another character. Yet as the carnage unfolds, the plot doesn't go anywhere other than where we expect it to go, while there's a huge character misstep in the final third that is more laughable than being the twister it's obviously meant to be.However, if taken purely as a piece of salted popcorn, the film delivers enough thrills and excitement to warrant the viewing because the action comes thick and fast. From the breathtaking opening as we are literally dropped into the jungle with Adrien Brody, to the inevitable face off for the finale, we have been treated to stabs, chops, thrusts, dismemberment's, beheadings and everyones personal fave - spine ripping! All this and there's barely any blood spilt, lest the green kind counts of course? While the new look predators are awesome, more meaner in tone, with new armour and devoid of the pointless characterisation that others in the franchise have tried to give them, these are unremitting killers, lets leave them like that please! And while it lacks the dark humour of McTiernan's movie, it does have a wry sense of knowing, normally with the portrayal of Royce by Brody.Brody is just fine, it's a performance that shows that should he ever want to make the easy money available in action/adventure type movies? Then he will have no problem getting work. He's buffed up, given himself a gruffer voice and more than shows a capable hand at punching, firing and sticking the tongue firmly in cheek. The others, unsurprisingly, are walking clichés, with some obviously only there to be deathly slotted more quickly than the others. The fun here is in waiting to see who gets it first/next and etc. It has to be said, though, that Topher Grace is not only annoying, he's also very miscast, but in fairness he's not exactly helped by the writing of his character either.Not great but hugely enjoyable popcorn fodder. A sequel would be welcome, but with Rodriguez directing and a new face on the writing panel. 7/10",Predators
14,Theo Robertson,"More Of A Remake Than A Sequel , All Done In A Cynical Way",4,8 December 2012,The problem with doing a crossover franchise is that once you've let the genie out of the bottle it stays out . Once Universal Pictures started introducing different monsters to the FRANKENSTEIN franchise they never went back to a stand alone story with the monster . Having a crossover franchise is very damaging anyway and reeks of commercial desperation . It' would have been a good idea if the studio in question had just dumped the PREDATOR tag and thought up a new alien monster but the thinking is that there might be a ready made market of people who enjoyed one of the previous movies . The cynicism goes even deeper when the trailer for the film features a scene that doesn't appear in the movie itself . Remember that heart stopping scene where several red dots appear on Adrien Brody's character ? That's the scene that I'm talking about The story starts with a bunch of characters meeting up in the jungle . Who are these people ? Why are they there ? Firstly they're stock cosmopolitan military cyphers . Secondly the audience know why they're there to battle the eponymous Predators so right away the audience are one step in front of the characters which makes for uninvolving participation . In fact the first half hour plays out exactly like the first film from 23 years earlier of a military unit trekking through a jungle pursued by an unseen foe . There are a couple of plot turns that happen halfway through that do contain a certain impact but then it just sets up fight scenes with the big setpiece at the end mirroring the one seen in the original . One can't help noticing that Adrien Brody is a poor substitute for Arnie however In summary this could have been a generic SF actioner . In fact it might have worked better if it had been and we had Jason Stathem and Vincent Cassel and Monica in starring roles . However what we got was a tired franchise movie done in a rather cynical way . If you haven't seen the original PREDATOR from all these years ago you might like it but if you have seen the original you'll realise it's a remake rather than a film in its own right,Predators
15,Scarecrow-88,Predators,7,28 July 2010,"Human predators(mercenaries, soldiers, etc), ""plucked"" from Earth find themselves on an ""alien preserve"" and must fight for survival as they become the hunted. Director Nimród Antal and his filmmaking team decide to model their film after the Original instead of the Dark Horse comic series, which had a lot of people up at arms. The world with which the characters find themselves is like one large planet of jungle. In fact, this jungle looks eerily familiar to the ""Guatemala"" one from the first film. No one will be mistaking Adrien Brody for Arnold Schwarzenegger anytime soon, but I don't think he ruins things, either. He's black ops, trained in the art of hunting and killing his prey, which is why the Predators somehow knew he'd be fit to ""compete"" against. How the Predators are able to discover how to select their prey is beyond me, but such plot meant very little to me, to tell you the truth. I wanted the Predators to be as threatening and menacing as the one in the first film and think Antal and company got the job done in this regard. When the humans first ""arrive""(awakening from an induced sleep while in the sky just in time for their parachutes to open; well, most of them, one guy wasn't so lucky), I have to admit, that I was biting my nails. The jungle was really intimidating in this movie..you knew they were out there, just not where. The Predators are really decked out in this movie with these awesome armored suits, helmet-mask, and adamanton blades which protrude from their arm shields. One Predator has this prehistoric jaw carved out of stone and it's helmet mask is similar to the slick heads of the xenomorphs from the Alien movies. The cast is a collection of criminals and killers, all specialized in warfare. Brody has the intellect and level-headedness. Alice Braga is the token female of the group, the one who has some semblance of emotion while the others mostly care about their own hides(this trust and loyalty for the group almost kills her at the end when one among them isn't so nice). Walton Goggins is a white trash rapist who was on death row before being selected..though, he does prove himself brave against one of the Predators with only a knife at his disposal. Oleg Taktarov is an Eastern European soldier with a cannon akin to the one Jesse the Body Ventura blasted in the original film. Louis Ozawa Changchien is a bad ass Oriental assassin who actually goes mano a mano with a Predator using a Samurai sword! Danny Trejo is sadly underutilized as a Mexican mercenary..one of my few real complaints about the movie, to be honest.My major beef with PREDATORS is the use of Laurence Fishburne who could've easily had been a worthy leader opposite Brody, but instead is given the part of an oddball who talks to an invisible friend, and is temporarily an ally to the group, showing them a hideout inside an alien ship, an abandoned relic. Fishburne appears mid way and barely has time to leave a lasting impression..I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking handing an actor of Fishburne's caliber such a measly role. He's a kook who has somehow survived for like ""ten seasons"" as a scavenger. Topher Grace has an interesting twist to his character, revealed in a rather unusual way at the end, but it doesn't quite make sense(even if he's not what we think he is, why reveal his hand during such a life-threatening situation in the movie?)in the grand scheme of things..why does this personality emerge when he's trapped in a pit with Predators dueling up above? Oh, yeah, there's also a Predator battle as one who was bound by others of it's race to ensnare the human group engages with ""Steel jaw"" in combat, ending in a gnarly beheading. Mahershalalhashbaz Ali is another mercenary who is used as bait by Brody to discover information on their alien enemies. Lots of action with a storyline that isn't demanding and characters who aren't complex. It's a popcorn Summer movie, folks, plain and simple. I got what I wanted, three(count them, three)Predators, and they even have monstrous ""pets"" which chase after our group in one suspenseful scene(these creatures are on all fours and have these long curling husks from their mouths). Brody's goal is to find the Predators' ship and get home to Earth..how he'd drive the ship is anyone's guess.",Predators
16,LeonLouisRicci,Mediocre Exploitation,7,2 January 2014,"With all the Sequels, they have not come close to anything resembling the Excellent Original that is a Bonafide Classic. The First Predator (1987) had everything and expecting any that followed to be as good is an Exercise in Futility. But one does expect Competence and at least a Compelling, Exciting, Film that keeps the Energy flowing and the Franchise Fresh.All of the Films that came after the first have been Disappointing in one way or another. Each having a Residue of Coolness, mainly because of the Predator Creature and its back-story. This one starts out with an Intriguing Promise and an Exciting Opening but things do not hold up so well as it moves along through the Jungle on the Path of Least Resistance.As the Second Act Starts the Cleverness and Intrigue Stop, giving way to way too much of this and that. It becomes muddy and chaotic, the Story gets confusing and all the potential gets lost in the Mayhem. There is a lot going on here and there is quite a bit of Bombast, but it looks confused and contrary. Sometimes Less is More and if the Movie settled down a bit for some Suspense and Structure it could have been so much Better. As it is, just another Mediocre Exploitation of the Title Character used to sell Tickets.",Predators
17,CinemaSerf,Big budget action film with nothing underneath.,6,9 October 2021,"Luckily, Hollywood's flirtation with Adrien Brody didn't last too long because in this he, as usual, is really pretty uninspiring. He leads an international group of highly skilled soldier-cum-ninjas who find themselves being hunted by an invisible prey in a very dense jungle. It's quite clear that this thing - or maybe these things - hunting them are clever and cunning, but can the team stay one step ahead of their pursuers and escape? Unlike the first film which really did manage to create a sense of peril, this is just a compendium of survival scenarios that serve to bring home to me that I didn't really want to rescue any of them. There is a brief, and somewhat pointless appearance from Laurence Fishburne but otherwise this is really just a procedural thriller devoid of much menace and full of repetitive special effects that though quite professionally constructed, can't make this scary or interesting. Sure, it looks good and the score tries hard to raise the tension, but in the end I really wasn't bothered.",Predators
18,dbborroughs,Too much talk in the middle weakens an otherwise solid action film,6,27 July 2010,"After the disaster that was the second Alien vs Predator film the Predator franchise gets restarted by Robert Rodriguez and Nimrod Antal (who did Vacancy and last years underrated Armored).The plot has a bunch of humans parachuting on to what they find out is an alien world where they are hunted by some Predators.There are a few twists but thats essentially it.The film is gangbusters to start but then the film kind of slows down as the middle section seems to be more talk than action. Its not bad but my fanny started to squirm as I wished that things would pick up and there be more hunting. The talk is a bad thing since it makes you start to question some of the plot points. Eventually the film picks up and we get a suitable action packed ending.Its good. Its solid and its a nice addition to the franchise, I just think this is going to play better on second viewing where my expectations are going to be lower.",Predators
19,zardoz-13,"""Predators"" Is Par-For-The-Course.",4,14 July 2010,"Producer Robert Rodriguez says the new movie ""Predators"" serves as a sequel to ""Predator 2."" In other words, the events in both ""Alien vs. Predator"" and ""Alien vs. Predator: Requiem"" have nothing to do with the pyrotechnics in ""Predators."" You don't need to know this tidbit of information to enjoy this lackluster, one-dimensional, routine sequel, but ""Predator"" purists may wonder where the Adrien Brody epic fits into the franchise. ""Armored"" director Nimród Antal deliberately selected scrawny Academy Award winning actor Adrien Brody of ""The Pianist"" as the protagonist because he sought somebody who looked nothing like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Unfortunately, sequels to Arnold movies, as ""Terminator: Salvation"" illustrated, are almost always doomed when Hollywood seeks to substitute somebody for Schwarzenegger. Indeed, Adrien Brody is a splendid actor, but he lacks the charisma that a leading man must exude in an outlandish, high-body count science fiction actioneer. Aside from Brody, everybody else looks like they deserved this fair but far from memorable melodrama cast in a mold similar to the 1932 movie ""The Most Dangerous Game."" In ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" men hunted men on a remote island. In ""Predators,"" an octet of professional killers find themselves inexplicably pitted against one of the most lethal sci-fi monsters prowling the cinematic galaxy. Anybody who has seen any of the ""Predator"" movies, including ""Alien vs. Predator"" and ""Alien vs. Predator: Requiem,"" knows that those Rastafarian-looking space aliens with dreadlocks and bad attitudes constitute formidable foes. They possess a Chameleon-like capability that enables them to appear invisible. Anybody who dares to tote a weapon around these deadly dudes is begging to be exterminated. Predators are equipped with sophisticated technology that enables them to sight in their targets thanks to their solar vision.""Predators"" opens with a scrappy mercenary, Royce (Adrien Brody of ""Splice""), tumbling head-over-heels from the sky with a parachute that deploys at the last second and partially breaks our hero's fall. Nevertheless, he slams into the ground and lays sprawled in confusion and shock. No sooner has Royce gotten up than another parachutist plunges to the earth. Colombian drug cartel enforcer Cuchillo (Danny Trejo of ""Desperado"") brandishes two submachine guns after he lands only a matter of yards from Royce. They react with surprise when a third man whose chute never opened hits the dirt nearby. Their surprise doesn't last long because somebody unleashes a fusillade of lead that chews up the foliage as they scramble for cover. A Russian Spetsnaz commando, Nikolai (Oleg Taktarov of ""Righteous Kill""), wields a 7.62 mm, 6-barrel, air-cooled, electrically driven machine gun called a M134 minigun. He opens fire on Royce and Cuchillo without knowing whether they are friend or foe. Wily Royce pulls an end-around and slips up behind him to pokes the muzzle of his automatic weapon in the man's neck. Once Royce explains that Nikolai is shooting at the wrong people, our hero spots yet another parachutist on the trail ahead. Israeli Defense Forces sniper Isabelle (Alice Braga of ""City of God"") has lined them up in her sights until they show that they pose no threat. Gradually, their number grows to include Sierra Leone death squad member Mombasa (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali of ""Crossing Over""), Yakuza hit-man Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien of ""Gigantic"") and convicted mass murderer Stans (Walton Goggins of ""The Crow: Salvation""). The last one to join their ranks is a doctor, Edwin (Topher Grace of ""Spider-Man 3""), who carries no weapons, save a pocket-knife, and doubles ostensibly as the chief source of what modicum of humor ""Predators"" boasts.Initially, everybody follows Royce. He is heading for the high ground to get his bearings. Royce seems to know something about everything happening in ""Predators,"" and he provides answers to his cohort's questions about their whereabouts and strategy. Royce resembles the leathery tough western hero Randolph Scott who always seemed to know every rock, every trail, and every waterhole in his 1950's westerns. Each of these killers shares the same back story. They were at different points on planet Earth when they saw a light and then regained consciousness as they were free-falling from the sky. When Royce and company reach the high ground, they stand shocked at the sight of several planets on the horizon of their own planet. Before long they find themselves menaced by giant dogs with horns bristling from their ugly snouts and wreathing their backs. Royce brings them out of their reverie with his own conclusions about their presence on this faraway planet: ""We're being hunted. We were all brought here for the same purpose. This planet is a game preserve, and we're the game."" Eventually, the evil Predator appears and Isabelle shares her information about the fiends with Royce. Basically, this represents the first—but not the last time—that ""Predators"" links itself with the seminal Schwarzenegger saga.Naturally pugnacious, Predators usually don't bear malice toward innocents. Nobody in ""Predators,"" however, qualifies as an innocent. Each is armed with some kind of exotic weapon, even if it proves to be little more than a pocket knife. Sadly, some of their superior firepower don't pay off because the character lugging it around exerts little control over it. Apart from its muddled plot and murky photography, the big problem with ""Predators"" is that it presents nothing that ""Predator"" purists haven't already seen. The Alex Litvak and Michael Finch screenplay provides nothing that wasn't done better in the first two ""Predator"" outings. Indeed, Royce learns about the value of mud as camouflage. Humor rarely lightens the load of this numbing 106-minute epic. Moreover, the writers neglect to adequately explain the hierarchy of the Predators. How does a Berserker Predator differ from a Falconer Predator? Primarily, the gory action occurs in a primitive jungle setting that turns out to be the stomping grounds for the eponymous monster. Worse the Litvak and Finch screenplay boasts no over-the-top sarcasm. Nobody utters the line ""Ain't got time to bleed."" ""Predators"" is par-for-the-course.",Predators
20,Boba_Fett1138,Good sequel to continue the Predator franchise with again.,7,6 September 2011,"This movie works better as a sequel than ""Predator 2"" did but is it also a better movie? In most ways yes, though it at the same time is being far from a perfect movie and also never comes noway near the level of the first Predator movie.You could say that this is a maintaining and entertaining movie. A perfectly good enough movie to kill some time with and have a good time with as well. But that is all this movie is really. All of the tension and action remains quite formulaic and is all something we have seen before. Of course there are no real surprises anymore, after already 4 Predator related movies. Still the movie manages to come up with plenty of original stuff, while at the same time remaining loyal to its original concept and to the first movie.Yes, in lots of ways this movie is really being like the first Predator movie, from 1987. No Arnold this time but still a Gatling gun, a jungle, boobytraps and even lots of characters are similar to those from the original first movie. It even mimics some moments out of the original and even its buildup is sort of the same, which does feel a bit forced at certain points but it will please the fans of the 1987 movie. It's a real throwback to the first original movie, which is only a positive thing to say, since that movie is such a fantastic one, that still holds up very well today.It really was a great move to make this movie much like the first movie. It takes the concept back to its original roots, of a cat and mouse game, set in an hot, dense jungle. It's something very simple but yet so effective, also because the Predators are such awesome looking and skilled aliens. It really doesn't change much about this concept and I'm glad the movie didn't tried too hard to improve on the first movie and alter stuff heavily. At first some of the changes about the Predators seemed quite redundant and I felt sort of 'offended' by it (such as the fact that the heat vision of the Predators had suddenly received a modern updated look) but I must say that the movie does give a rather good, simple, plausible explanation for it as to why the Predators and some of their weapons are different from those in the previous movies. It all makes it obvious that this movie was put together by people who really put lots of time and effort into it and also had a real love for the first Predator movie. Even John Debney's musical score is totally like Alan Silvestri's original ""Predator"" score, which is not something I'm criticizing, simply because it keeps suiting the movie and all of its moments so extremely well.But it only is the first half of the movie that is being like a real great throwback to the first movie. Literly as the movie starts to get dark it starts doing its own thing, which just wasn't as great or entertaining as the stuff it did in its first half. You could say that the movie becomes a bit too much a science-fiction flick and decides to go more over-the-top with stuff. Perhaps it also tried too hard to be like the ""Aliens"" out of the Alien movie-series, hence also the title ""Predators"", with a S at the end. No, I didn't really liked the second half of the movie as much as the first but it at least didn't ruined the movie for me.It seemed like a very unlikely choice to cast Adrien Brody in the main lead for an action flick but he simply did a great job and was totally believable in his tough role. And lets face it, he also really needed a big, successful movie again. This movie shows once more how incredibly versatile he actual is as an actor. It also has a good supporting cast, which provides the movie with plenty of solid, fun characters in it.It's simply a solid, good sequel, that paves the way for more Predator movies. And who would had ever thought that would be possible, after the somewhat disappointing ""Predator 2"" and the weak Alien vs. Predator movies.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Predators
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,No meat on this one,6,13 July 2010,"There's a reason this was made 19 years after the last one, and that a series that is 23 years old only has three entries. Let's not beat around the bush; there should only have been one. No, think about it. Can you think of anything that wasn't in the first one that it was actually lacking? Anything that your own imagination did not supply, and that you won't find as many different versions of as there are viewers? We should not have everything spelled out. It is in our nature to seek answers; however, quality fiction is not meant to deliver them. The medium of film is regarded as a lesser form of expression than writing(which in this movie is subpar with a few exceptions), painting, music... and it is because it too often says so much. Sure, there are many poor flicks... then again, there are lousy novels, pictures, and so on, as well. Hitchcock understood. That's why we're still watching and analyzing his work, decades, as much as half a century later. This one, it won't last. There is a concept or two here that are interesting. This tries for the tension and suspense of the original; it mostly fails. Credit for the attempt? Perhaps, if it had anything else to add. We don't sense that they're being stalked(it isn't even compelling when they do POV shots, in spite of them largely not being overused), and for entire portions, it doesn't feel like they're out there. Frankly, I was bored a couple of times, especially the last twenty minutes. How can that happen? It's the characters. They're utterly unlikable(this couldn't do more to make them repulsive), and we consequently do not care about them. Any of them. Not the least. I get the double entendre of the title; yes, Robert, you're very clever. Now go have a cookie, pat yourself on the head and please keep your firecrackers away from features that require subtlety. We know what you do well, please admit it to yourself, as well. I like your best stuff, give us that, instead. The dialog is cliché-ridden machismo. There is nothing in this other than the game-reserve; no back-story, no other conflict, and it is simply not enough. The casting is fine; Ali(not going to try to spell that whopper of a first name of his) isn't bad, if his accent is a tad over the top. Brody, the one we know can act, is reduced to grunting his dumb lines. You can't go wrong with Trejo, and they don't. Grace is the irritating comic relief, as I feared. He needs to stop taking roles in second sequels that he can't live up to. Changchien is fantastic. He underplays every moment, with a delicate smoothness to his motions. The cinematography has definite moments, here and there. Editing mistakes ""fast"" for ""exciting"". The majority of the deaths are anti-climactic. In this, the ""humor"" is stupid and the jokes are obvious. There aren't a lot of surprises in this, and almost no positive ones. The Predator behavior is inconsistent, including within itself. They ignore AvP 1 and 2, and yet make mistakes that they did. The action is decent, seldom memorable, and hampered by the amount of shooting greatly exceeding the number of times they hit anything. CGI in this tends to look nice, if not all of it does. There is a lot of bloody violence with occasional gore and infrequent strong language. I recommend this to those who want to see the extra-terrestrial hunters again, provided they are uncritical. It's not just bleeding(as it has been for nearly 20 years), it's dead. Let it do so with some measure dignity, please. 6/10",Predators

23,neil-476,OK but I want more!,7,15 July 2010,"Robert Rodrigues has got his mitts on the Predator franchise and his given us (as producer) what in many ways is a re-tread of the very first movie - humans being hunted in jungle. The tweak is that the jungle is on an alien planet, although this is fairly irrelevant - apart from some alien hunting hounds and a spectacular skyscape it might as well be in the Brazilian rain forest.Because the story, such as it is, is ""last man standing"" - in what order are the humans going to be killed, and in what ways? This is all delivered in an adequately gripping fashion but, apart from the resolution (which I found very pleasing), this film doesn't really offer us anything we haven't seen before. Even the ""surprise"" when Topher Grace turns is no surprise because you know there must have been a reason why he was chosen as part of the group. And it is particularly unconvincing because it flies in the face of personal survival.I find myself thinking that if there are going to be more Predator films, they need to offer us a bit more. In particular, the Predators deserve to be a bit more than merely slaughter machines in the Jason Vorhees mould - maybe we need to see a bit more Predator culture, possibly even a bit of character development (not easy, perhaps, but surely film-makers are supposed to be a resourceful lot?) After 5 movies, all I know is that Predators hunt. I don't know why they arrive in spaceships with invisibility suits and then light up their camp with burning torches. I also don't know how the humans can unload half a Vietnam's worth of ordinance face first at their invisible *rses without any effect whatsoever, yet Ms Sniper can then immediately take one of them out on a transverse run with a single shot between heavy tree growth.Ah well.

I like Brody and think he's a good actor, but I couldn't take him seriously at all in this role, and especially not when he delivers every line like Christian Bale's Batman.But Brody aside, this film should satisfy fans of the series, as it gives you everything you want in a ""Predator"" movie. It's got enough gore to satisfy blood lust but not so much that it's off-putting, and some money was clearly spent on the visual effects. There's a ridiculous cameo by Laurence Fishburne to suffer through, and a rather unnecessarily nasty plot tangent thrown in late in the movie involving Topher Grace, but otherwise this is an action movie that allows you to do what action movies are supposed to allow you to do -- check your brain at the door, sit back and enjoy the ride.Grade: B",Predators

Having no other option they all agree to band together even though each of them come from different backgrounds and cultures. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty good entry in the ""Predator Series"" which combined plenty of action and drama throughout. As a matter of fact, if anything, I would say that this film was on a par with the original movie and slightly better than Predator 2. But that is just my opinion.

26,ferguson-6,Parachute to Hell,3,10 July 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. If you are a fan of the 1987 original film directed by John McTiernan (Die Hard) and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, you couldn't help but be a bit excited about this new one since Robert Rodriguez was involved. What a letdown.With films from Mr. Rodriguez, we have always been able to count on creativity, ingenuity, humor and excitement. This one lacks all. Now to be fair, the director is actually Nimrod Antal, whose resume includes Armored and Vacancy, both of which are as empty as this one.Of course when your cast is minus Arnold, you start with a major handicap. When you replace him with Adrien Brody, you appear to be aiming for disappointment. Sure Mr. Brody did a few sit-ups to prep for this role, but he is no action hero, regardless of how he mimics the Christian Bale Batman voice to seem tough.The rest of the bad luck cast of characters is rounded out by Laurence Fishbourne, Alice Braga, the great Danny Trejo (a Rodriguez staple), Topher Grace and Walton Goggins (so great as Boyd Crowder in Justified, TV's best new series this past season). Just to add to the misery, the film score is simplistic and a bit of a joke itself. It certainly misses the excellent work of Alan Silvestri from the first film.Not much need to discuss the lack of any real new material here. The bad guys are pretty much the same, the weapons are pretty much the same and the cast and script are weaker. The real money with this one lies in a ""making of"" documentary in which the first meeting takes place and we hear the pitch to make a thrilling new action movie ... a new Predator movie ... starring ...

One can suppose that this is to make it better. If so then it is a weak attempt. Starts out fine with Adrien Brody awakening to free fall from the sky towards a jungle. He is ensembled with others whom will become graphic targets for the hunt by hulking alien beings. Director Nimrod Antal provides a few suspenseful moments but it is the massive warrior creatures that are the norm. The planet and its atmosphere resemble a war torn jungle, which works from a visual standpoint. The cast is at the mercy of formula material that has them run and eventually die horrible deaths. Predicting the final three alive is an easy task and certainly not providing much in terms of fun. The only big ambition seems to be creative methods of death, which places it in similar vein as most horror films. Brody is joined by Alice Braga, Topher Grace and an appearance by Laurence Fishburne that is intriguing until its abrupt end. He encounters what is left of our crew before leading them to refuge in a spacecraft. He explains his survival before the story takes another violent turn. Then the film returns to its pointless manhunt in which characters are continued to be dined on like lobster in a boiling pot.

Dropped into the vast jungle of a distant world, these human predators must learn just who, or what, they are up against, and that their ability, knowledge and wits are tested to the limits in the battle of survival of kill or be killed....Finally after nearly twenty years and two very suspect Vs movies, we get Predator back to it's basic premise, hunt in the jungle. Only this time there isn't a General Hopper to save and there are more Predators, and the group do not know each other.From the start, none of the characters are likable, not one. We get no insight to there background or any real history from them, we are just thrown straight into the jungle.And then the fun begins. Like the original, we are flirted with glimpses of the Predator very early on and we get his heat vision every now and again.But when the movie lets rip, it lets rip and it never let's up until the end.My only problem with the film is that the director obviously researched the original too much. First off, we have two characters who have Billys traits from the original. One looks into the jungle scared, and the other guy rips off Billys death straight from the original.then we have one character tell another the whole plot from the first movie, just in case their are a few people in the audience who haven't seen it.Fishbourne has a wasted extended cameo in the middle. All he does is explain to the cast the plot of the film, and act a little mad. It's pointless.But other than that, this is an amazing sequel, and it really makes you forget the AvP movies. There has been a lot of love and time and effort put into this film, and it looks as if Rodriguez knows what the fans want.It's a typical action movie, not much talking apart from people having a go at each other, and typical characters whose deaths you can see coming from a mile off.Highly recommended",Predators
30,Aaron1375,"Had more of the spirit of the first ""Predator"" movie, but all in all still just an okay movie.",6,10 July 2010,"There were aspects of this film I enjoyed and then there were aspects of it I did not care for. Overall, I think it was an okay movie, just nothing really all that great or exciting or new. Though that is the theme for this summer, all remakes and sequels so far. I am really hoping the film ""Inception"" turns out to be good as it is neither. This film story is a bit off which is one of the problems I had with it. Basically, the screen opens with a shot of a man plummeting downward toward a jungle, at just the right moment a parachute opens and the guy avoids being a pancake. He has no recollection of who or what pushed him out of a plane. He soon meets up with others all seemingly very vicious people as we have soldiers, enforcer types and even a prisoner. The only one that seems out of place is a doctor. Well let the speculation begin, though it is not to long before they realize they are not in Kansas anymore and that they are in fact on an alien world some distance I would imagine away from Earth. Of course, there is something on the planet with them as some really nasty animals attack and are called off. Some good action here and there and the movie starts out blazing fast and while not a work of art it was proving to be a summer popcorn flick. Then they meet Laurence Fishbourne's character and the film bogs down a bit as did the movie ""War of the Worlds"" did when Tom Cruise went into the house with the insane Tim Robbins character. Though this character is also a bit like the one character in the film ""Pandorum"" too, though I will not say what he did, otherwise I will spoil this segment of the film. Through all of this there are very few shots of the predator aliens. Sure they turn up here and there, but a lot of times they seem nearly nonexistent. The acting is rather good, Adrien Brody was rather convincing as a mercenary, Topher Grace was rather good as the good doctor and such though I was not wild about Laurence's character because that character seemed pointless and served no purpose other than to extend the film needlessly. One also has to wonder about things as why are the big bad predators bringing things to hunt to this jungle area? They are putting their prey at a major disadvantage as most of the group was rather beat up thanks to the fall from the sky. Seems they want less of a challenge instead of more of one. Also, an advanced alien race that can fly to other galaxies can not devise a better way of getting its prey to the planet than parachutes that may or may not open? Also, when the heck do they have time to make ships that can fly to other planets? They seem like a rather backwards race collecting bones and such and hunting, are there scientific predators that do not hunt, but actually do something a bit more constructive? What was the point of the two races of predators other than the brief fight between the two types? Why are we supposed to be pulling for the humans as a lot of them were criminals, drug dealers and virtual terrorist with only a couple of them being plain soldiers that one may be more inclined to pull for? Why was Laurence Fishborne in this film? Like I said, along with some good in this movie there is a lot of bad in the form of one to many unanswered questions. In the end, the jungle landscape reminds one of the first ""Predator"" film and it certainly has its moments as I think it was better than two, but overall it is just a mindless summer movie that passed the time okay and will most likely be quickly forgotten.",Predators

It surely isn't a remake of the original (1987) but it comes close what we have seen then. The effects are much better up to today and it shows but still, the originality of the 1987 isn't there. This time it takes place at another planet. It starts of pretty well and is suspenseful not knowing how and when the predators will attack. First there's an attack of some prehistoric monsters, and from then on you know, here they come. The predators have evolved, funny part is, the old predator is also still on the planet (the 1987 version). So somehow the movie is linked with the old one. The story goes that Arnold Schwarzenegger would play in this version but somehow it didn't work out so they re-wrote the script. After 45 minutes it lacks a bit of activity, but later on it picks up pretty well. It clocks in at 107 minutes and it never shows. The blood is running sometimes in gory fashion and the acting is pretty well. I really enjoyed it, naturally, it's an open end so I guess the franchise isn't over yet. Be sure to catch the 107 minute version to watch it in all his pride. It's been hunted down by the geeks, my version is already OOP on Blu Ray, containing a film cell. I found it at a horror convention. When we arrived there were a lot of them at several shops, just in the early afternoon they were all sold out, so far it's the only special edition (limited cine edition)...",Predators
32,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Predators,7,5 July 2010,"Just to clear the air, this film is not a reboot or a remake of Predator and its associated follow ups. Rather, it is an able complement to the established mythos, adding its own two cents worth to an expanding franchise, even though it chose to ignore the crossover hybrids with the Versus Aliens films, and connects itself directly to the first Predator film by John McTiernan starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.Produced by Roger Rodriguez and directed by Nimrod Antal who did films like Kontroll, Vacancy and Armoured, Predators clearly met its objectives it set out to achieve without flashy fanfare, with Antal providing assured direction in the many set action pieces that don't rely on the hair-tearing quick MTV-styled cuts so just to let you know everything's kinetic and hyper. Some scenes will also get your eyebrows raised at how gory and violent this installment can get, with in-your-face dismemberment, and even one which shows how cruelly wicked the Predator can be with a move that closely resembles a ""finish him"" from Mortal Kombat.The story is kept simple with one primary plot, and that is to witness how a band of para- military personnel get to outwit and outlast the Predators as they learn that they're prey and game for the alien beings, which are armed to the teeth in advanced weaponry, armour and various sensors like infra-red, with electromagnetic pulses ready to discharge and wreck havoc on human rifles. It's not a fair fight, especially when it comes to the famed cloaking camouflage that gives the Predators an advantage. But hey, who says hunting sport has to be fair anyway? In fact, this film only serves to cement the franchise plot point of having as many characters as possible to add to body count, and we're almost unlikely to hope for anyone to emerge unscathed when faced with such odds. But well, Schwarzenegger's character did it in the first film through a simple battle strategy, so perhaps this group of rag-tags have some of the same luck as well. Given the Predator's penchant to play with their game, don't expect instant blood and gore as a few teasers have to be in place, before the first death occurs (well, death to an unidentifiable actor, is no count)Leading the team is Adrien Brody's reluctant soldier of fortune, who decides early on that while he's a member of the human tribe, he's not going to forge any emotional bonds with anyone, being quite dogged and determined to leave the gaming planet alive. This of course irks Isabelle (Alice Braga) the female soldier from Israel who holds a few secrets of her own, and others from the likes of Chechnyan soldier Nicolai (Oleg Taktarov) to the odd one out in Doctor Edwin (Topher Grace), given the rest have tasted real life action in the killing fields, now brought through alien abduction to a planet whose atmosphere is almost identical to Earth, for a game of survival skills.The story also allows time to dwell on moral dilemma and ethical issues that fighters face in combat, with the strategies employed by the Predators seem to have come out of familiar theatres of war and rules of engagement, where traps are set not to kill but to maim, and fellow survivors forced to make hard decisions as to saving their new found compatriots, or whether it's all man for himself. While offering no surprise twists, with the A-list cast here you can bet that they are all roles which offer a slight challenge, and to see how what we have assumed is the rabbit of the group, able to flip the other way round gradually to reveal some violent, inner ambition.One of the selling points here is of course watching Adrien Brody play the brooding action hero complete with bulging biceps and washboard stomach. The lack of young, emerging alpha-males in the action genre has somehow led to dramatic actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal and now Brody to hit the gym to buff up for films that require the baring of torso, to make the characters they play more believable, since they are soldiers of sorts hell bent on saving the day. Laurence Fishburne did what he could with his limited appearance in becoming the oracle that is to educate everyone on what conditions are like on the unnamed planet.But one thing that will be missed, is those frequent POVs as seen through the Predator's eyes and hi-tech helmet. The filmmakers seem to want to steer clear of this since it doesn't offer anything new, but I always thought it was cool to adopt the Predator's first perspective. That aside, Predators delivered when it mattered, even though the story seemed like a shade of the original, and the aliens aren't really using the entire plethora of weapons available to them. One can continuously make the Predator films since this one opened doors, and it'll be interesting to see how others apply their take on the mythos now.",Predators
33,siderite,Like a faded memory of the first Predator movie,7,29 September 2010,"I like Adrien Brody, I really do, but this role was not something I would have seen him do. Without the feral aggression of Arnold Schwarzenegger's or the Danny Glover's old timer shrewdness, he barely manages to carry a character that is, by movie genre default, completely predictable. The only ones who couldn't see him coming a mile away were the predators, heh :)The plot isn't much different from the first Predator, only it is placed in a different jungle with a slightly more high tech bunch. Actually, the story is so similar, that I suspect they wanted to somehow overwrite the failures that were the Alien vs Predator films. The actors all do well, but not great. Lawrence Fishburn appears suddenly and shocks both with age and fat as with the schizoid character he plays. But instead of developing it further, they just abandon it midway.Bottom line: a good enough Predator movie, with Alice Braga's smile outshining predators and fighters alike. I enjoyed the alien dogs and the second alien prey type, although, again, huge potential was wasted here. I wish people would take a chance and go with their gut instead of ""reinventing"" old and tried recipes.",Predators

35,MovieAddict2016,"Entertaining enough, but too deriviative of the original to be a completely convincing reboot/sequel",7,28 September 2010,"""Predators"" starts off very solid and it has good intentions. It cold opens on a group of strangers falling out of the sky onto an alien planet. We don't know much about any of them except that they're mercenaries, and their pasts are cloudy. It's an intriguing way to establish the film's beginning, a sort of Agatha Christie no-one-is-who-they-seem-to-be twist, and for the first half it's actually quite a tense film, as the titular Predators are kept at bay and we instead see their hounds and another mysterious alien creature that resembles the original Predator design worn by Jean-Claude Van Damme before he was fired from the 1987 film and the alien was (thankfully) redesigned.An homage like that is clever and underground enough that only true fans will get it, but the movie's second half is filled with far too many references - and borderline repeats - of the first film that it's hard to perceive it as either a successful reboot of the series OR a proper sequel. I never liked ""Predator 2"" but you have to admit that, apart from the ending, it was really quite different from the original, and ""Predators"" follows the original a bit too closely for my tastes. From the scene with the Yakuza warrior that mimics Billy's fight of honor in the first film, to the ""You're one ugly..."" line spoken in Russian, to the whole final act of the film, it's basically one long nod to the first film...and after a while it gets old.The dialogue is also quite corny at times and it's something Rodriguez has always had problems with. This movie incorporates elements of his original 1996 script which was fairly awful and read like bad fanboy fiction, and I think he kept a few too many of those elements in this film. The concept of different Predator subspecies is commendable but the new ""Black Predator""/Super Predator is fairly underwhelming, and the creature make-up - while MUCH better than the AvP films - still doesn't hold a candle to the first Predator design (which is ironic because the original Predator is in this film, yet its face still looks rubbery and mechanical compared to the '87 creature design). I guess losing Stan Winston might be part of the reason for that. It just looks like guys in suits whereas in the original Predator there was something about the design and the way the actor (who has since passed on from AIDS) played him that made it startlingly realistic for an ostensible B-movie.And, to be fair, that's all this is: a studio B-movie with Rodriguez's influence felt through-and-through. If you like his previous films and style of guerrilla filmmaking, you'll enjoy this. Nimrod Antal does a better job of directing than the Strause Brothers but Paul W.S. Anderson did a better job of capturing the Alien/Predator atmosphere (too bad his film sucked). This movie captures the jungle element of the first film but its style is different - I dunno if it's digital or what but the way it's shot is similar to Rodriguez's last few movies (particularly ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"") and I don't really think it fits this type of movie.Adrien Brody does a solid job in the lead and I'd like to see him in the next one. The rest of the cast varies (the underrated Walter Goggins, from ""Justified,"" is sadly underused), with an unnecessary female character who seems like a more battle-ready clone of the female character in the first film. (Once again: too much copping of the first flick.) She even recounts an urban legend of the Predators to the rest of the group, almost identical to how the girl in ""Predator"" told Arnold and his crew about the myth surrounding the creatures in the jungles. And then Laurence Fishburne inexplicably pops up halfway through the film in Vietnam gear, humming ""Rise of the Valkyries,"" and you know it's a tongue-in-cheek reference to his role in ""Apocalypse Now,"" but he's dead a few scenes later and you're left wondering why he was even included. (He chews the scenery up, and not really in a good way - a little too over-the-top if you ask me, complete with the mandatory imaginary friend that Crazy Characters always have.)If I'm complaining a lot about this film it's because I guess my expectations were a bit high after such a long wait. I'm an adult now and my infatuation with Predator has slightly wanted, but I remember as a teen reading endless rumours about a ""Predator 3"" on the Internet and just dying for it to get made. In a way I'm glad it took so long because if I had seen this as a 14-year-old I probably would have been more disappointed than I am today.I feel like ""Predators"" has some very admirable elements and you can tell the people making it are huge fans of the original, but that's problematic in the sense that they have way too many homages and nods to the original for the film to stand on its own. Antal is no James Cameron and this is no ""Aliens,"" but for what it is - an entertaining B-movie with creatures who haven't been done justice in a couple decades - it's entertaining enough and certainly better than Predator 2 or any of the AvP abominations. I just hope the next one stands apart from the original and dares to go places that this film didn't.",Predators
36,OllieSuave-007,Back in the jungle.,7,15 May 2014,"After Predator 2 took you to the city slums and Alien vs. Predator 1 and 2 took you to a campfest, Predators takes you back to the exotic and mysterious feel of the jungle, where a group of mercenaries, soldiers, criminals and doctors mysteriously lands in a jungle located on the planet inhabited by the Predator creatures. They become prey of those aliens in a deadly hunting game and they need to join forces to destroy the creatures and escape the planet. Like the original Predator movie, this sequel is action-packed with a scary sci-fi element to it. The plot is intriguing and fast-paced; you won't see much fillers or subplots in this movie - just to-the-point and non-stop action. The parts where each of the group members attempt to survive and escape the Predators' grasp provides heart-pounding excitement, and the personal agenda and secret background of each character give the film suspenseful surprises. Nimród Antal did a fine job directing and the writing team provided a pretty solid script. The jungle setting gives you an eerie, exotic and mysterious outer-planet feel, and the design for the classic Predator and the new Predator creatures are creepy, but spectacular. A main issue I have with the movie is the cast. Though OK overall, the characters weren't as memorable or impressive as in the original Predator movie and I thought Adrian Brody was terribly miscast as Royce. His over-exerting Batman-style voice and macho image wasn't too convincing for me, though he did make a good effort. Royce's group overall wasn't as heroic or courageous as Dutch's group in the original movie. And, the second issue ***spoiler ahead*** was that I thought the movie was anti-climatic and left too much plot-threads hanging at the end. Overall, it doesn't surpass the original Predator movie in entertainment and quality, but miles ahead of the other Predator and Alien vs. Predator sequels in the genre. Grade B-",Predators
37,Hellmant,A movie for the fan-boys (like myself) to definitely rejoice in!,9,14 October 2010,"'PREDATORS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) One of the greatest sci-fi action / horror films of all time, 1987's 'PREDATOR', finally gets a second sequel, it's been twenty years since the extremely underrated Danny Glover starring 'PREDATOR 2', and now fan-boys finally have a trilogy to talk about and worship for years to come. This third chapter doesn't disappoint, it's highly inspired by the original monster movie classic and it gives fans everything they've been dieing for. Robert Rodriguez, who wrote an early draft of the screenplay back in 1994, serves as producer and hired Nimrod Antal (being a fan of his earlier films 'VACANCY' and 'CONTROL') to direct and newcomers Alex Litvak and Michael Finch to rewrite his script. The cast is filled with the likes of Adrien Brody (impressively turning in his first anti-hero action star lead), Topher Grace, Alice Braga (who's very reminiscent of Elpidia Carrillo's 'Anna' character from the original and is the third Latin female lead in a 'PREDATOR' film, also following Maria Conchita Alonso from the second chapter) and Laurence Fishburne and rising action star Danny Trejo (and Rodriguez regular) in glorified cameo roles.The film continues the 'PREDATOR' mythology to their home planet this time around (after the Central American jungle setting in the first film and a violent war torn Los Angeles in the second). It opens amidst a breathtakingly suspenseful scene of a mercenary (Brody) waking to find himself falling to the planet below as he desperately tries to release his parachute. He soon teams up with several other mercenaries, military vets and criminals (who were also air dropped in) as they try to learn where they are and what happened to them. It quickly becomes a race for survival as they learn they're being hunted by the technologically superior and game mastering alien race we know as 'predators'. The film becomes a psychological character study, packed with twists, as we learn a little more about each of the characters and their own motivations and reliability.The movie is pretty ingeniously written and takes the franchise in some surprising new directions while still staying true to the spirit and feel of the original two films. It's impressively scored by John Debney who was highly inspired by Alan Silvestri's classic original music and even uses the same theme several times. Several nods are made to the original film throughout (while it quietly ignores the 'ALINE VS. PREDATOR' franchise). Antal's directing is fitting and more than adequate for the material. The movie moves at breakneck speeds for most of the film but does flounder from time to time randomly. This creates a little bit of an uneven feel and tone for the movie but once it gets to the third act it's all action. A nearly perfect creature feature with nothing really to complain about except for a few small pacing issues. The action, gore, special effects and witty dialog are all top notch; this is a movie for the fan-boys (like myself) to definitely rejoice in.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7PN3jnaP1Q",Predators
38,thesar-2,Lost on the Live-Action Avatar Planet,7,10 July 2010,"Boy, I'm going to get bashed for this one – I hope, at least; keep your comments coming! – but 2010's Predators was actually better than the original.That's said with reservations. Schwarzenegger was what made the original stand out, well, that and the origin of a great movie-character, the Predator. No one here really stood out, aside from Adrien Brody, whom I normally despise. Also, it was rather long, predictable – you really did know who was going to die and in what order, horribly paced and in need of some true editing. And the finale's revolution of a ""bad guy"" was both laughable and utterly unnecessary.That all said, I'm not a true fan of the original. I liked it enough for a throw-back to the old 1980's action genre, especially starring Schwarzenegger, but it wasn't near the top of any of my lists. So, it's not much for me to say I liked this slightly-above-average actioner was better.As mentioned, Adrien Brody did stand up and made me finally care about him or his character. The rest of the cast were the typical cardboard cut-outs aside from Topher Grace. I would admit he was funny at times, but he was just his typical character and couldn't have possibly known a few things as the ""doctor"" he claimed he was since he was dealing with alien life-forms. Namely plants.Several humans are literally dropped into a live-action Avatar jungle/planet and ban together as if they've just finished watching TV's Lost or woke up in a Saw (II) nightmare. After the confusion of their roles and why they're there, they discover they're being hunted by both demon dogs and, huh, the Predators. It's survival of the fittest without so much of a real explanation of their being there other than for someone's amusement.Along the way, they meet CSI's Laurence Fishburne who gives a little more details, but for the most part, it's just a journey to get off the planet where apparently many others have failed.They say this is Predator 1.5, asking you to (rightfully) forget part 2 or any of the Alien Vs. Predator movies, much like Halloween: H20 wanted you to nix Halloween III-VI, or Superman Returns was to replace Superman III-IV. I didn't catch that here. Sure, they mention the events in 1987 (or Predator #1) but part 2 or the Alien crossovers could've very well happened.At any rate, take their advice. The only ones that should, in fact, exist are: Predator and Predators.The movie's certainly not great, but for them to take the simplicity of part one, and expand on many ideas and backgrounds, it's worth a viewing.",Predators

40,lost-in-limbo,"""They can hear you. Smell you. They see you.""",5,17 July 2010,"""Predators"" is a standard b-movie given high-end gloss. Nothing wrong with that, but I came away leaving the cinema mainly disappointed. Not that I went in with high expectations (as I haven't read / heard all that much about it), it was that I found it rather plain and flat with very little in rousing excitement. That's what I wanted, but there seemed to be too little of it especially after the beginning which throws you right in to it. In short it dragged on too much, and when the script isn't the greatest (leaden exchanges and too much stating the bloody obvious) and the characters are nothing more than empty shells, makes it best to just up the ante and that's where I thought it failed. Some stylish sequences aside, it just didn't have the oomph (no balls) or manage to hold any sense of intensity so when it came to the action it was mainly too short, tensionless or simply unimaginative with not much flow to it. The predators seem to go missing in spells, and they hardly fought together with the danger of the situation hardly sustained. Some smidgen of gore is prominent, but nothing too in your face in a way it was more tone down than I thought it would be. However the special effects are very well executed (mainly on the fact they didn't overkill it), and it was interesting to see the few types of predators (which Fishburne's character slightly touches upon). Don't know if it was really necessary (because it didn't really add up to anything), but the crafted out details of these predator creations were striking, but like others have mentioned they did lack the towering menace (despite their aggression) and even the personality.The performances are decent, but nothing particularly memorable to standout due to their measly sketching. Adrian Brody is agreeable (and I don't feel his miscast), so is Alice Braga. Topher Grace comes across oddly, but most of the friction came from Walton Goggins' character, and his one-on-one encounter with one of these hybrid predators had to be one of the best moments. Along with Louis Ozawa Changchien taking on a predator with a samurai sword in a grass field, as director Nimród Antal provides some nice touches within that sequence. A babbling Laurence Fishburne and especially Danny Trejo are wasted.The feature is well-produced, as it's slickly directed by Antal. But with this streamlined approach it made it more distant, where it didn't harbour the blood and guts in a relentlessly gritty charge. Never did it feel like it got really down and dirty either, despite being smothered and alienated by the thick muggy jungle vegetation. While threadbare, some instances and plot devices showed some insight, be if it didn't make much sense or implied something that ended even more vague or messy. There's an odd twist towards the end that felt needless, and on that point there is a lot of pointless occurrences (where Laurence Fishburne comes into play to tells us what we already figured out) that could've been cut-out to make the slender narrative much tighter. Even the ending finishes on a lazy note. Plenty of homage's to the original creeps up too -- from lines of dialogues, props, scenes and even the atmospheric music score is almost lifted right out.Not that it was a bad film, far from it I just wished they did a lot more with it because of its expansive possibilities especially in regards to the action stakes. Brainlessly diverting, but mainly unexceptional and not as thrilling as I hoped.",Predators
41,Robert_duder,"Absolutely brilliant. A superb sequel, and a great summer Blockbuster",9,9 July 2010,"2010 won't be known for a summer of amazing blockbusters. Some of the more expected hits have been less than stellar. So I'm not sure what my expectations were for this film. It has been literally years since I've seen a Predator movie and even then it was the PG'd Aliens vs Predator movie (the first one.) On top of that I am NOT a fan of Adrien Brody, I find him strange and usually uncharismatic on screen (see my review for the very strange Splice.) So all these pieces in place I was treated to nearly two hours of an absolutely superb horror, monster, action flick that was worthy of the best Summer has to offer. Considering it has been twenty years since the last official Predator sequel Predators offers a solid follow up the original two films and even manages to throw in an honourable mention to the first film and Schwarzenegger's iconic role as Dutch. The film isn't any feat of acting or even movie making BUT it manages to capture a campy feel and keep its gory style with a 14 A rating. Predators is completely and utterly entertaining and will blow you through the back of the theatre.Remember how I mentioned my mostly dislike for Adrien Brody? Well for the first time in his career I eat my words. He actually carries the action film very well. His wiry awkward frame is more built and he does what some reviewers are calling a bad 'Christian Bale' impression growling and whispering and yet for me it worked! I thought he was a great anti-hero and a true bad ass and that is really impressive. I would watch him destroy Predators again and again. Alice Braga plays the moral conscience of the film and still a killer soldier. She is good in her role but in a far more subtle way than Brody. Her and Brody don't have a lot of chemistry but there isn't a romance between them anyways. Character actor Walton Goggins is terrific as a death row inmate who uses smarts, wise cracks, and plain insanity to take on the Predators. He's fast and loud and fills out the cast well. Oleg Taktarov plays a Russian soldier who totes around a giant mini gun and says very little. His character has no depth and while he sort of physically rounds out the group he is very bland and comes across like a doofus. Topher Grace sort of sticks out in the cast as the non-combative Doctor. Grace also stereotypically is the comic relief but its used just enough and works quite well. Laurence Fishburne has a small but significant and really great role in the film as the eccentric survivor on the planet. The role is over in a flash but he is still terrific. Danny Trejo, Louis Ozawa Changchien, and Mahershalalhashbaz Ali are great as the supporting cast who don't get as much screen time or lines but they are imperative to the story.I imagine even when Robert Rodriguez produces a film he sinks himself into it. This film feels like it has his style, handling, and ability all over it. That isn't meant to undermine director Nimród Antal who clearly tells a great story and handles his cast expertly as the characters unfold. Its a large cast but each character has their own style and purpose and everyone will find their favourite amongst the rag tag band of killers and prey. Some seriously killer fights, some amazingly gory moments (a Predator literally ripping out a man's spine, skull attached), and a story that is independent in its own world and yet still ties flawlessly into the rest of the films. Truly and absolutely a terrific gem of a summer blockbuster. I've seen a lot of solid reviews on this film so I hope it gets the recognition and dollars that it deserves. 9/10",Predators
42,bowmanblue,Back to Basics,8,16 May 2014,"The original Predator movie was a classic, largely because of its simplistic plot, but naturally helped along by the presence of Mr Schwarzenegger up against a cool alien.Then came Predator 2 - the same cool alien, but no Austrian counterpart. Then came those Aliens vs Predator movies and the less said about them the better. Unfortunately, these three misfires left the Predator franchise a bit dead in the water.Hooray for 'Predators.' Okay, so it'll never outdo the original. In fact, sometimes it gets so close to the original that you could be mistaken for thinking it's a bit of a remake. But it's not. Don't worry about it. Although technically more of a sequel to Predator 2 than the first movie, Predators keeps everything that is good about the original and just sort of shakes them all around a bit.Predators gives us another jungle, albeit on an alien planet instead of South America, a bunch of hunted humans, this time all sorts of mercenaries instead of one platoon of Americans and three hunting aliens instead of just the loner.If you can get over having (the only slightly skinnier) Adrian Brody in place of Conan the Terminator and were a fan of the original, you'll probably like this. There are plenty of nods to the first film and it shows us a little more of what those dastardly head-hunting aliens get up to.

They soon discover they were taken from earth and brought to an alien planet to be hunted. They all have something in common in that they are all dangerous people with most of them having a military background. Adrian Brody is the ring leader and seems to know all the right things to do. Toward the end, Lawerence Fishburne shows up but he's only on screen a very short time. He was wasted. The way he showed up so much more could have been done with his character. The whole movie wasn't written well and Brody had some pretty bad one liners.The predators don't really have any original kills. And there isn't a lot of blood. Even the alien dogs don't do much. The fight between the predator and guy with the sword was cool, but it should have lasted longer and had more action.

45,CuriosityKilledShawn,A huge disappointment,5,10 July 2010,"I went in with average expectations and I was still let down. The Predator's good name has been tarnished over the years by turning what was once a scary monster into a franchise that sells toys to kids. Crossing it over with Alien was a bad idea that resulted in an indescribably awful film in 2004 and, impossibly, an even worse film in 2008. As far as I was concerned the franchise was dead. Fox had eviscerated it in a way that even the Pred himself was find appalling.But then came Robert Rodriguez to the rescue. R-Rod apparently wrote the script in 1994 as Predator 3 and ever since it had been in production hell. The internet rumors said it was a remake, then a reboot, then R-Rod assured us it was a straight-up sequel to the long-underrated Predator 2 and that it would disregard the AvP travesties.Well thank Jeebus for that because the arrogant and philistine nature of all of these wretched reboots/reimaginings is really getting on my nerves. But answer me this...why, if this IS essentially Predator 3 and not a remake, do R-Rod and Nimrod Antal spend 90% of the film referencing the first Predator and cramming in-jokes into the story. And why, if they hated AvP so much, did they lift dialogue corresponding to an identical scene and re-use it? BE YOUR OWN FILM!!!There ain't none of guts, and grit, and grain of McTiernan's tour-de-force from 1987. What we get in 2010 is a glossy, slick, CGI-coated fanboy's wet dream.Seven tough guys and a latino chick (sound familiar?) find themselves on an alien planet and soon deduct, through repetitive exposition, that they are there to be hunted. The first 30 minutes are somewhat muted (echoing McTiernan's approach) before they, as expected, begin to die one-by-one. How original.It's almost impossible to list the many, many faults in the script, but I'll try. My first grievance is that the motivations of the characters are so undefined I'm dubious as to whether not they actually exist. Adrien Brody's character (Royce, who isn't named until the final minute) is supposed to be the Alpha Male of the group, but he's certainly no Dutch Shaeffer. There's nothing mythic or memorable about him whatsoever, and his methods for defeating the otherworldly antagonists are questionable as well as being mostly irrelevant.The other six men dropped into the meat grinder are a collection of stereotypes rather than names. The Mexican, the Jailbird, the Russian, The Yakuza, the African and the Doctor. Some are already heavily armed, a few are not. Did the Predator's arm them or were they already clutching weapons? Did the Predators really think that hunting a weedy doctor would make good sport? But here's the biggest problem with the movie...how the hell did the Predators pick their prey? Did they study them from the space? How did they get the Jailbird? Break into prison and kidnap him without anyone seeing? And if Topher Grace's doctor is supposed to be a serial killer (another plot element that is so poorly delivered I'm confused about whether or not it qualifies as actually existing) then how the hell would the Predators be able to figure that out? Do they have some sort of space detective agency that determined he'd be a worthy prey to take across the galaxy? Absolute nonsense! A lot of hype preceded Larry Fishburne's role as Noland, the survivor/scavenger. But his role is utterly pointless other than to provide a bit of exposition and supply the rest of the characters with more weapons to keep on fighting before he's unceremoniously killed off with bad CGI. He also explains that there are two types of Predator out there, like Wolves compared to dogs. We see, what appears to be, a very skinny and naked Predator hunt Mr. Mad Doctor but once it's dead there isn't even a decent establishing shot of what it really is. But it doesn't matter anyway since, like the boar-dogs, they're completely forgotten about by the next scene.The four Predators themselves are not scary in the slightest. In Predator he was kept shrouded in mystery and his methods and style gave him personality. In Predator 2, despite being seen more, he was still a deadly and formidable enemy. But here, with four of them vying for screen time, they are just creatures we're waiting to see killed and not anything even remotely terrifying.And if these characters are supposed to be excellent prey for the Rastafarian Pred-heads then I am suspicious as to what actually counts for decent sport on Planet Predator. These people have the WORST aim in film history. They fire hundreds and hundreds of rounds (presumably they have some sort of infinite ammo cheat code as they certainly are not carrying as much as they fire) but do very little damage to their many pursuers. I don't think they could even hit the floor if they fell on it.I was relieved to learn that John Debney was using Alan Silvestri's wonderful themes from the first two movies. But he does so little with the material it's almost a carbon copy of the first. It's not like there's nowhere left to go with the themes. Look at how Silvestri reinterpreted his own melodies for Predator 2. Are you telling me that an alien planet filled with awe and mystery couldn't provide a setting for a deeper and more interesting score? I've had it franchises. Bond. Freddy. Jason. Predator...all of them! I want new movies with new directions. Not stale, decades-old characters and directors more interested in writing love-letters to them than actually making a movie with lasting appeal.If I wanted to watch Predator I would have stuck-on the Blu Ray. When money is spent on a supposed sequel it should deliver something new. Predators fails on this promise.",Predators

47,callanvass,"Predators is entertaining, I'll certainly give it that much.",7,8 January 2011,"(Credit IMDb) Chosen for their ability to kill without conscience, a group of killers, some trained and some who are not, must endeavor the alien race of predators that have set out to target them as prey. Dropped into the vast jungle of a distant world, these human predators must learn just who, or what, they are up against, and that their ability, knowledge and wits are tested to the limits in the battle of survival of kill or be killed. I was seriously initially dreading the worst outcome for this movie. I detest remakes, and I wasn't feeling any excitement for this. To my surprise, not only was it entertaining but it was a half-way decent movie as well. It had some of the tension that the original had, it had the same ballsy attitude, and the weird cast fit perfectly! It at least tried to be its own movie, and that I appreciated heavily. What I really admired about Predators was the intensity level. It had it in spades, and I was surprised to see I was on the edge of my seat countless times. The jungle itself is fittingly creepy, while the action level is constant, and when the action isn't there it's relying on tension. Only complains are, I felt the ending was a bit shoddy, while the Predators don't feel as intimidating as the ones in the original. Here, you can clearly notice that CGI is apparent sometimes. I also felt they didn't go as far as they could with the finale, it was good, but my selfish mentality wanted even more oomph for the pay-off. I learned this isn't a true remake, considering they mention how Arnie escaped in the first, shame he didn't agree to a cameo. Performances. Adrien Brody is surprisingly great as the anti-hero. He channels Arnie, but in his own style. He's a loner; he doesn't care about anyone but himself most of the time, and does whatever it takes to survive the situations that are created before him. A pure bad-ass, and I loved watching him work. Topher Grace is surprisingly great as well. I didn't think he'd fit, but his awkward, clumsy routine fit the film beautifully. His character has a great twist in the end. Alice Braga is quite solid in her role. I bought her character, and she had the right amount of vulnerability and toughness. Good chemistry with Brody too. Walton Goggins is good as the sleaze-ball. He is very tough to like, and you'll enjoy seeing him get his up commence. Oleg Taktarov has a thick accent, that's hard to understand, but he played a likable Russian. Laurence Fishburne shows up near the end, but it's a memorable part. Danny Trejo always add depth to any film he's in, big or small. Here is no different.Bottom line. I enjoyed this quite a bit, and I like to think of it as more of a follow-up then a remake. Nevertheless, sequel, remake, whatever you want to label it, it's pretty entertaining. Recommended7/10",Predators

Instead we get the usual somewhat diverse group of bad people who however really aren't bad enough to make the movie interesting. Most die in a rather perfunctory way. The twist with one of the characters is mildly interesting to make the movie a bit more than average, but the elite strategy, the interplay between characters seem just average of this movie genre. There was more opportunity to really make this sci fi adventure thriller much more compelling, but the Alien-like soundtrack along with the odd use of a rather intriguing but underused Laurence Fishburne just really make the movie that great. It was watchable, but not that memorable.",Predators
51,The-Sarkologist,Robert Rodriguez is a legend,8,7 June 2013,"As I was watching this film all I could think of was how much of a legend Robert Rodriguez is, that is until I discovered that he was the producer as opposed to the director. I guess the difference I see is that the director tends to have a lot more creative input to the movie whereas the producer sees the movie come together from a more business orientated view. However, the modern movie tends to have a lot more input from a lot more quarters that, say, a book, meaning that one cannot generally point to a single person as say 'that is his/her film' though the accolades generally go to the director (and they generally also appear first on the list of the crew).Basically Predators returns to the style of the original film, namely a group of soldiers wondering through a jungle being hunted by, and hunting, the predators. However, unlike the first movie which involved a special forces team in South America, we have a number of 'dangerous' individuals dropped onto the planet so that the predators can hunt them. Also, we are dealing with more predators than we did in the original films (and the AVP movies are pretty much being ignored here).Mind you, I suspect that you could still insert this film (as well as Prometheus, though I did not particularly like Prometheus) into the Alien-Predator universe and still have a somewhat consistent approach to the film. I do suspect that there are suggestions in the AVP movies that the aliens were created by the Predators to hunt, and the thing with Prometheus was that there was a suggestion that it was not until that film that the aliens were created (whereas in the AVP movies they had been around for a lot longer than that).I still really like the AVP movies, where they attempt to bring the best of both of the movies into a single movie, as well as attempting to answer the question that has been floating around since the mid-eighties, and that was who would win out of a fight between an Alien and a Predator. One could also through in the question as to who would win out of a fight between a Terminator and an Alien or a Predator (though I have not seen a TVP or an AVT movie, or comic book, yet, not that I have looked all that hard – I'm sure they do exist).The thing that seems to flow through this movie though is that the Predators kidnap the most dangerous of the humans, equip them, and set them off on a hunt. However, there is also the idea that these humans are not necessarily humans, but rather they are monsters. However the problem with equating these humans with monsters is that many of them still have human aspects to them. For instance the Yakuza still desires to fight an honourable fight, and the unknown special forces guy (who we never learn who or what he is, even at the end) goes back to help the others. However, it is also interesting to note that the one that seems to be the most human is actually the most monstrous, though this is not revealed until the end of the film (and sorry about the spoiler, but I do mark all of my movie commentaries as such).",Predators

56,tomgillespie2002,The Predator mythology almost back on track,5,13 February 2011,"It's been a long-time coming. Every since 1987's Arnie classic Predator and it's less impressive sequel, a franchise continuation has been frequently discussed and considered by many a director. It's strange that it's taken such a long time to arrive. The fanbase is already there, waiting intently, and the fact that the star is the beast itself means waiting for a big name actor to sign up doesn't really come into the question. When it fell into the hands of Robert Rodriguez, I had mixed feelings. He can do action well (Desperado) and not so well (Once Upon A Time In Mexico), but apart from the odd dodgy film choice (The Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl - seriously, why?) his films have been at a good standard. But then I found out he was only going to write and produce it, and a director called Nimrod was going to direct instead, so my expectations lowered slightly.The film opens with a buffed-up Adrien Brody awakening as he falls from a plane onto a strange landscape, to be later joined by other characters unaware of where they are and how they got there. The characters eventually reveal themselves to be members of various elite forces from across the globe, including Israeli sniper Isabelle (Alice Braga), Spetnaz grunt Nikolai (Oleg Taktarov), and nerdy doctor Edwin (Topher Grace), whose inclusion confuses the group. It soon dawns on the group, after some keen observation by mercenary Royce (Brody), that they are a subject of a hunt and are being tested as they are the best of the best at what they do. Whereas in the original two, it was one Predator hunting Arnie, Danny Glover and the huge teeth of Gary Busey in our environment, in Predators they have been dropped on an alien planet seemingly set up to train young Predators, and unluckily for Brody and the gang, there's three of the horrible bastards. So they must combine their own specialist skills and work out how to combat invisibility, high powered weapons, super strength and an annoying character in Stans (Walton Goggins).It's nice to see the Predator back in it's own movie after being raped by Paul W.S. Anderson in Alien Vs. Predator, and back in similar terrain as the original 1987 film. Unsurprisingly, it's not as good as the original but it does have it's moments. A pretty cool sword fight between one Predator and the mysterious, silent Yakuza Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien), and a welcome return for the 'classic' Predator, the same kind that battled with Arnie in the first film. But these are few and far between and are ruined by stock archetypal characters and an ill-advised 'Predator dogs' attack which are basically crap CGI inventions, and an excuse to put a bit of action into the film.Fans will no doubt enjoy it, but I feel the talent of Rodriguez could have added something different about the film. And a bit of nasty gore wouldn't have gone amiss. The film just seems a bit too tame. It's practically a retread of the original with different actors and more Predators. At least it does try and develop the mythology, and it's nice to see Adrien Brody tackle a different type of role and pull it off confidently.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Predators

58,TheMovieDiorama,Predators travels back to its jungle roots but feels drier than its humid environment.,5,8 September 2018,"After a lacklustre sequel and collaboration with a far more successful sci-fi franchise, Rodriguez attempts to resurrect this carcass of a film series. While the primitive nature of this sequel is an undeniably smart move, it unfortunately feels like a carbon copy of the original with limited alterations. A group of humans are mysteriously dropped onto a foreign planet, where their survival instincts are tested when extraterrestrials hunt them down. Infamous ""Predators"" utilising cloaking technology, supremely powerful energy weapons and an arsenal of strategies to hunt their prey. Audiences wanted gory action, and they most certainly received it. From a ""Predator"" ripping the spinal cord out of a body in true 'Mortal Kombat' style (fatality!) to a sword fight in the middle of a blustery field. The visceral action excels in harking back to the campiness of the original, with a decent cast supporting this perspective. Brody releasing his inner masculinity but with Grace succumbing to his typecast role. Innocent geeky outcast who suddenly shifts personality in what is an absolutely unnecessary plot twist. And that's exactly where several issues creep in. A horrifically dull screenplay, that attempts to imitate the cheesiness of ""Get to da choppppa!"", creates monotonous characters that have no natural interactions at all. Coincidentally, each individual is very different, with the protagonist feeding the audience the plot as the film progresses. ""They are hunting us!"", ""they want us to run!"" and ""they are stronger than us!"". Several lines of dialogue that result in no imagination, consequently becoming derivatively straight forward that contains limited captivation. Conversely, the ambiguity that the plot conceals did manage to occasionally hold my attention.

Thankfully, most of the film is shot in sun soaked settings, ther aint no darkly lit scene, no flickering lights n no annoying quick cut editing.Brody put on lottuva lean muscles n is convincing as the alpha male. The way his character decapitates the quadruped beast aka the hunting dog of the Predators is amazing.Similar to Vacany, Nimrod Antal restrained the gore but kept the tension n suspense throughout. The only time the film slows down is when the group meets Fishburne's character.
Similar to Armoured, Antal stuck with the old skool style, kept to the basic but brutal action.Similar to the 1987 original, this one too has a shocking scene where a Predator rips out a spine and skull.The sword scene is very well done with the swooshing grasses, the aerial view n some good katana movements.

The most recent efforts pitting the Predators against their ""enemies"" the Xenomorphs, the ""Alien vs. Predator"" films, had reduced a once imaginative and fearsome beast to a B movie creature feature. Producer Robert Rodriguez and director Nimrod Antal attempt to change that with ""Predators"" plural.""Predators"" ranks as next best to the John McTiernan original, but that's not exactly a major accomplishment. This version restores the intensity and creative possibility to the ""Predator"" universe, but it doesn't match the genre-changing impact that the 1987 film had on monsters-hunting-humans movies. The film plays it safe, going for action with that macho, carnal brutality that only true lovers of monster and alien flicks enjoy.The film definitely proves that a reinvention of the series was warranted. The script from rookie writers Alex Litvak and Michael Finch is a home run as far as concept goes: this time the humans are on the Predators' planet and they aren't just any humans, but representative of the most elite killers from all over the globe. In other words, the Predators want to hunt the very best killers humankind has to offer.Adrien Brody stars as the firm-willed but mysterious leader of the pack. He takes charge early on in the story, but also as far as acting. Lowering his voice to the ""Christian Bale as Batman"" frequency, he proves he has leading man ability and command. It helps to mask that Litvak and Finch write his nameless (except for the last few minutes) character with a bit of an exaggerated no-nonsense attitude, to the point where he always seems to know what's up, have a plan, or have surmised just the right amount of information to compel the action forward.""Predators"" begins with more promise than it ends with. The drama begins with Brody falling through the sky and landing on the planet with the other ""prisoner,"" who certainly fail to trust each other at first and slowly begin to realize over the first half hour just what they're up against. Antal, who directed the unsuccessful heist flick ""Armored"" and the well-received horror flick ""Vacancy"" is much more patient and deliberate during this first act, but once the Predators make their first appearance, the lid comes off. Part of the power of the original ""Predator"" as with ""Alien"" and other successful films with ""hunters"" was the slow reveal, never completely showing the enemy force until the suspense has built up, if ever. True, we know what Predators look like after 20-plus years, but these enemies become less menacing when overexposed, especially given that there's way more than one in this film.Thematically I was almost impressed that the script was concerned with themes of survival at all costs and the idea of compassion being both a weakness and a strength of human nature. It was not just dialogue that illustrated these points, but actual events, particularly the outcome of when the group meets Laurence Fishbourne's character, who has been on the planet surviving in solitude for quite some time.But the anti-climactic action sequences really snuff the suspense and otherwise impressive pacing of the film. For example, there's no reason to have a Japanese Yakuza hit-man engaging in a sword fight with a Predator than to have a human engaging in a sword fight with a Predator. The scene itself does not work nearly as well as the idea behind it.However, ""Predators"" is definitely taking the franchise back in a positive direction and with a capable and likable lead in Brody. It carries more of the ""Predator"" tradition than the failed sequels before it, but by no means does it reach the threshold of what a ""Predator"" movie can be.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Predators

63,southdavid,Jungle is Massive !,7,6 March 2020,"Ahead of the release of ""The Predator"" I rewatched and reviewed ""Predator"" and ""Predator 2"". I had meant to squeeze this one in too but unfortunately it didn't work out time wise, and then I forgot, but then I remembered. Cool story bro.Royce (Adrian Brody) a US Military trained mercenary wakes up plunging towards the jungle having been thrown from a plane. Just about saved by his parachutes deployment, he soon discovers that he's only one of a number of disparate characters that awoke in the same situation. Initially suspicious of each other, the group come together on the realisation that they are being hunted.Let's get the controversy out of the way first, this is my favourite of the four main ""Predator"" films. I appreciate the first one is a classic and my score will probably reflect that, but I think personally I enjoy this one most of all. I love the Robert Rodriquez of it. Stripped back, intense, mostly logical. No preamble or establishing scenes, straight into the action. Brody is great, I don't understand the criticism that he doesn't look like an action star. He's scowling, haunted and vicious - everything a legitimate mercenary would be and a cinematic antihero should be. Trejo, Mahershala Ali, Walton Goggins - the casting team did a great job in spotting talent for the lesser roles.But, It's too long in general and specifically goes slightly too long between action set pieces to hold our attention. I don't, in retrospect, like the diversion with Laurence Fishburne or his character. It makes sense, just the character feels like it's been done before. Also, I do think it's a little unclear exactly which Predator is which and how many make up each clan. Might have made more sense to make the second clan into a different alien altogether.Solid and reliable, if a little unspectacular.",Predators

65,jzappa,Predator vs. Predator,7,24 October 2011,"Predators, an entertaining film with genuine surprises, may be the first movie I've seen to start with a deus ex machina. Yes, the whole plot and all the humans plummet into the movie from the heavens, dropping toward the alien soil, shrieking, groping for ripcords on the parachutes that they didn't realize they had. The last thing they recall is a blinding blaze of light. The first to land, with a powerful thud, is Royce. The others then crash all around him.These people are bitter specialized murderers from all over: a mercenary, a yakuza (who uses a Hanzo sword; probably QT buddy Rodriguez's idea), an Israeli markswoman, a serial killer, an African warlord, etc. How did they find themselves in this dense jungle, and why? They determine they're on another planet: a flawlessly terra-formed one, it would appear. The gravity lets them walk as usual, and they can breathe and hydrate. Royce observes something bizarre: The sun never moves. They see there are three or four moons in the sky, which are either colossal or very near.Even more bizarre, it never becomes molten lava yanked around by enormous tidal waves. But as you always have to say when Rodriguez is involved, ""Whatever."" After the characters are assaulted by massive eponymous monsters, Royce nails it: They're in a game reservation. He solves a lot of questions in the movie, which might've been more interesting if he hadn't. But it's all still much more intriguing that just pitting two franchise monsters against each other. Instead, this movie is smart enough to again pit predators against humans, who are predators with the weakness of being human. It's the sense of compassion or empathy for our fellow human that makes us vulnerable to predators.But who oversees this game preserve, and why? If you remember the first Predator, Schwarzenegger and other mercs were in the Amazon pitted against an invisible predatory extraterrestrial. Has that alien race snatched humans into its galaxy for a rematch? Is it a sensible consumption of assets to transfer numerous people countless light years merely so you can kill them purposelessly? No time to ponder. Here come some extremely ferocious four-legged creatures whose horns and fangs continue too far in front of their mouths for them to be able to eat their prey. They don't even look like they can lie on their backs and scoop the quarry in with their feet owing to all the spikes on their backs.This is a Rodriguez production: Making sense is not an issue. The movie is generally about our malevolent protagonists being mauled by frightening mandible-jawed creatures. who use active camouflage and energy weapons, reposition as swiftly as panthers, can see in a variety of spectrums, and are equally as self-aware as humans, sans compassion of course. Nimrod Antal gave Vacancy a masterful sense of what to show and when to reveal it, and so is a proficient enough director to keep these villains intriguing throughout unintelligible jumbles of bullet-paced visual effects. The eponymous indigents see all in infrared POV shots via what seems like a closed-circuit monitor. Or sinister videotape on a motel TV set perhaps? There are invariably a handful of characters who get slaughtered in manhunt films like this. What puzzles me is why they all don't get slaughtered? Consider if that spiky warthog tackled you to the ground at 20 mph and all you could do was stick it with your knife, would you imagine you'd be making facetious comments on it later on? Still, a charming moment where Apocalypse Now alum Laurence Fishburne hums Ride of the Valkyrie nonetheless pulls us out of the claustrophobia by being meta-referential. On the other hand, lines like ""Say goodbye to your little friend"" work as momentary relief from the claustrophobia.",Predators
66,jtindahouse,Bland and by the book,5,16 September 2018,"'Predators' starts out with a really fun concept that should have made for a great movie. Eight of the toughest, meanest, badasses from Earth dropped onto an alien planet to be hunted. I mean I'll pay to see that movie every day of the week. Why then did the actual product feel so dull and uninspired? Firstly, I think the casting was poor in a lot of cases. These were all meant to be badasses, but very few of them actually pulled it off. Adrien Brody in the lead role for example, he gave a better performance than I admittedly expected from him, but he still never had me glued to my seat like I was watching a true action-hero. Then the rest of the cast for the most part was were just meh. Very bland in terms of what they were given to work with and ultimately their performances.Secondly, the film played out in such an incredibly formulaic and uninteresting way that it was truly hard to care about the fate of anyone. It made an effort near the end to mix things up with a twist, but that little side-story was over with almost before it even began - despite being the most interesting thing that happens in the film. I decided to watch this before going to see 'The Predator' tomorrow and I regret it a little now because it has left me less excited for that film than I was beforehand. Hopefully tomorrow is an improvement, because this one was a complete misfire.",Predators
67,Bezenby,Predatarse,4,11 December 2012,"With a budget the size of the Gross National Product of a medium sized African country, you think they would have come up with a better film. In the original, Arnie and a bunch of guys who looked like rubber gloves filled with walnuts took on a Predator and were turned into piles of mince. In the second, Danny Glover took on another Predator in the city with the help of Gary Busey and everything was voodoo magic, man. Here, Adrian Brody puts on a gruff voice and joins a bunch of killers dumped on a planet to be hunted by some Predators. And it's not that good at all. There's an awfully long time spent finding out things we already know from the first film, and very little hunting of humans by the Rastafarian aliens. Our heroes kind of wander around for a bit and bicker, as people do in these films, but it's all a bit hollow to be honest with you. I did like the bit where the Predator didn't kill Brody because he was so good at playing the piano, and what kind of Predator would snuff out a talent like that? There's also the fourth Predator who's been trussed up because he backed a different finalist for Strictly Come Dancing, and Larry Fishbourne turns up for a hugely pointless cameo which just leads the film down the old Alien territory. Nothing here really hits home at all, as if it was written by Hollywood's Going-through-the-motions-omatic. It doesn't even have any of the cheesy one-liners that made the first two films a laugh to watch. One liners? This film doesn't have time for one-liners! The thing is that story in theory could have been good, so what happened?",Predators
68,freemantle_uk,"Mindly entertaining, with a good amount of blood",6,8 July 2010,"Predator is easily recognized as one high points of 1980s action films from a period of that produced some of the best action film we know. It followed the success of Alien which was a excellent hybrid of sci-fi and horror. Seeing that Hollywood has been rebooting a number of franchise from the 80s (e.g. Die Hard and Indiana Jones), it surprising that it took so long for the Predator series to be revisited (excluding the Alien vs. Predator movies). But this time Robert Rodriguez and Nimrod Antal are taking a stab at his popular material in the producer and director's chairs.On a mysterious jungle planet a group of humans are thrusted into the middle of a strange world. This mixed group contents an American mercenary (Adrien Brody), an Israeli sniper (Alice Braga), Russian soldier (Oleg Taktarov), Sierra Leonian rebel death squad officer (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali), Mexican drug cartel enforcer (Danny Trejo), death row inmate (Walton Goggin), a doctor (Topher Grace) and a Yakuza assassin (Louis Ozawa Changchien), because team is not complete without a man with a sword. This ragtag are forced to work together as they are hunted by 3 powerful predators hunt them and picking them off one by one.Predators had to go on a long journey starting in 1994 when Rodriguez first pitched the idea. A number of directors were considered for the job including Neil Marshall (The Descent), Peter Berg (Hancock) and Marcus Nispel (Pathfinder) before Antal got the gig. Antal did a decent job, creating a dark, broody atmosphere whilst keeping a B-movie quality. Predators is fast paced, with a combination of action, horror and humour. With a budget of $45 Million the special effects are strong and it is entertaining with wide use of weapons in the film. But Antal was fond of showing the same scene from different angles, which is just an old fashioned, pointless action trick that is no longer used. Antal does not hold back on the violence which is what the audience will want to see in a Predator movie and he is subtle early on in the film when some characters disappear. He was able to bring in some moments of style and had some good creature designs to show he was more then a gun-for-hire.The acting too was of a decent level, but nothing beyond that. Brody is a talented actor and obviously trying his best, but he was miscasted as the tough action hero. His character was the most interesting, having to be a cunning and ruthless leader. Grace was in the film to offer comic relief and he did pretty well for the most part. The only other actor was Braga who was basically okay in the film. Most of the other actors were just stock characters waiting to be picked off by the Predators. Laurence Fishborne was also in the film but his acting was no where near his usual high standards. We just do not get to know these characters very well which is a big let down.The main problem with Predators is with the writing. The film was written by two first time writers and it seems they do not have a understanding of some elements of the original film. The best is the set, that one predator was able take on a team of US Special Forces fairly easily, so 3 predators should be able to fight a team of individuals: especially since two of them only armed with a knife and a scalpel and another with a pistol; a bit of a continuity error there. The film was filled with characters that the audience can not care able because we hardly get to know them. The film just goes through the motions till they are killed off. Added with inept, bland dialogue its ruin the illusion of film. The writers do attempt to bring in some interesting like a blood feud between two breeds of Predators, but does expand it. There is a fun to be had showing characters using their special forces skills and many of them are ruthless in their approach. None of the characters was a good guy back on Earth. The best aspects of the writing is bringing in a simple set-up which hark back to the original film. But it does not match that film's quality.",Predators
69,ebiros2,Nice change in scenery,7,1 May 2011,"After somewhat disappointing Predator 2, Predators returns with much better plot and acting.A gang of humans are kidnapped into an alien planet which its sole purpose is to be an intergalactic ""safari"" for the Predators. Their priority becomes survival, and escape from this prison planet.The Alien/Predator series has been on and off success and failure partly due in my opinion to the difficulty of bringing character into the plot where basically, characterless monster(s) becomes the center focus. In this movie, both the humans and the Predators act with considerable personality and brings real excitement to the story. Between the original Predator and this, both have become equal favorites for me.Acting, action, plot, special effects, and cinematography all scores high on this one, and is one of the best space alien movie to be created. Highly recommended.",Predators
70,kevin_robbins,There were elements of this I enjoyed but not enough to put this anywhere near as good as the first two films,6,1 October 2021,"Predators (2010) is a movie I recently watched on Amazon Prime. The storyline involves a group of random individuals who find themselves plummeting to a planet's surface wearing parachutes. When they arrive they quickly realize they aren't in Kansas anymore, the world is full of booby traps and they're being hunted. This movie is directed by Nimród Antal (Vacancy) and stars Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix), Adrien Brody (The Pianist), Topher Grace (That 70s Show), Walton Goggins (The Hateful Eight) and Danny Trejo (Machete). The storyline for this picture had a lot of potential and some interesting elements. The dogs in this were a bit over the top but a cool addition. The special effects were fantastic and the kill scenes were awesome. The settings were intense and well done. The cast was well selected and fun; except Brody, he seemed out of place and wasn't a good selection as the lead character. There were elements of this I enjoyed but not enough to put this anywhere near as good as the first two films.

71,PWNYCNY,"At last, the sequel we've all been waiting for",10,21 July 2010,"At last, a credible sequel to Predator, the 1987 movie. Unlike most sequels, this movie does justice to the original. In some respects it even surpasses the original, which is saying a lot as the original was a great movie. Adrien Brody is outstanding as a self-styled leader of a group of people literally thrown together to battle forces unknown to them but known to the audience. What makes the story particularly intense is wondering if they will figure out a way to escape. The movie features strong acting, an action-packed story, snappy dialog, good character development and a surprisingly intense performance by Topher Grace. Unlike the previous sequels in this series, this movie maintains its artistic integrity, meaning that it avoids becoming campy or a shameless spin off of the original. This movie is proof that when it wants to, Hollywood can produce a credible sequel without making it seem like a phony, last-minute second-rate job, which means there's still hope.",Predators
72,dee.reid,"""Predators"" - You're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy...",8,17 July 2010,"One of the truly great things about the Robert Rodriguez-produced, Nimrod Antal-directed ""Predators,"" a sequel of sorts to Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1987 sci-fi/action flick ""Predator,"" is that it is a lot smarter and more intelligent than it appears on the surface. Many movies today are pretty sophisticated and have high production values, etc., than they did this time 20 years ago, but they lack any real depth or intelligence to really make them stand out in some way, or become something memorable. ""Predators"" has some of the same qualities I just mentioned, but closer examination of the film reveals some degree of cinematic intelligence that makes it stand out amongst its contemporaries.""Predator"" was a fantastic revision of Richard Connell's famous 1924 short story ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (it's also my #9 favorite movie of all time); ""Predators"" takes the titular extraterrestrial hunters and places them in a more direct adaptation of that famous short story that has been re-worked and re-re-worked to death over the years since it was first published all those years ago in 1924. ""Predators"" concerns a group of Earthbound heavy-hitters who are dropped (like, literally parachuted) into an alien game preserve and hunted down much like Arnold's old crew was in Latin America in 1987.These are characters you could definitely count on to get the job done if they were on Earth. But out here, on some alien jungle planet, they're fair game: Royce (Adrien Brody) is an American special operations mercenary who eventually becomes the de-facto leader of the group; Edwin (Topher Grace) is a meager physician who is strangely out-of-place amongst these hard-hitting hard-a**es; Isabelle (Alice Braga) is an IDF-trained - Israeli Defense Forces - operative and CIA sharpshooter with an unusually cool head about her; Nikolai (Oleg Taktarov) is a highly decorated Spetsnaz - Russian Special Forces - soldier armed with a mini-gun; Stans (Walton Goggins) is a convicted mass murderer who was just days away from execution; Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien) worked as a Yakuza - Japanese mafia - assassin; Mombasa (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali) is an officer in a Sierra Leone death squad; and Cuchillo (Danny Trejo) is an enforcer with a Mexican drug cartel.As I said before, on Earth, they were the baddest of the bad. Out here, they're the Most Dangerous Game, the Most Dangerous Game to the titular alien Predators. They're not just Game, mind you, they're Prey. But these are no ordinary Predators, as we learn later on in the film. These particular creatures are a force to be reckoned with. They're deadlier, more heavily armed, more technologically sophisticated, and they don't play around. They're a more formidable presence than the creatures that originally stalked Ah-nold in 1987.""Predators"" isn't really a movie that I expected to like. Considering Hollywood's propensity for pointless sequels and remakes, we have a sequel here that actually seems worth the $8.75 ticket price. The characters are alive and three-dimensional and do have some depth to them, which makes it interesting trying to figure out who's going to die next; even more interesting, is the fact that even Walton Goggins's mass murderer and Topher Grace's seemingly misplaced Edwin (a pretty clever plot twist involving his character late in the film explains why this nerdy-looking stooge is amongst all these heavily armed, hardcore killers) are made useful to the plot and dare I say it, likable. Every character seems to have their moment, and are made useful to the overall storyline.Another cool aspect of ""Predators"" is the fact that the filmmakers know their ""Predator"" mythology pretty well, and pay plenty of homage to the earlier films (and to a greater/lesser extent, the comics) that have featured them. ""Predators"" is the fifth film to feature the creatures, and most of the film's references come directly from the first film - largely from Alan Silvestri's dynamic score (re-worked here by composer John Debney), to some re-staging of key moments from that film, and the song ""Long Tall Sally"" by Little Richard is played during the credits. There's also some strange pseudo-philosophy in here, too, about how on Earth these characters are predators, and now they themselves are being hunted by even bigger, not to mention, badder and deadlier, predators, and how these ruthless human beings are really not so different from their alien hunters. And a cameo in the middle of the film reveals a new face who seems to know a lot, and explain a lot, about these characters, their situation, and their murderous extraterrestrial stalkers.And speaking of explanations...I guess that the film's biggest weakness is the fact that it tends to explain a little too much to the audience, even if some of it is just careful - albeit incredibly accurate - speculation, which tends to take away from the mystery of the film. (The original 1987 ""Predator"" got by on much less.) If there was less explanation, the film wouldn't really seem to slow down so much during its quieter character-driven moments. It's almost like the filmmakers were betting on everyone in the audience not having a single clue about the earlier pictures and we no longer have the capacity to come to our own conclusions about what we're watching (this is highly debatable).I do look forward to watching ""Predators"" on DVD some time later this year. This is a worthy, unusually intelligent 2010 Hollywood picture that has steadily earned its place in a rich film legacy.8/10",Predators
73,JoeB131,Gives a new Dignity to the AVP movies,3,30 October 2010,"Which is saying a lot.The plot is this. A bunch of criminals and soldiers and mercenaries from around the world are dropped onto the alien planet. How? They never really tell us, other than somehow, these folks were abducted, rigged up with parachutes and dropped out of what one can presume is a spaceship.Puts forth a bunch of questions. How did the aliens know these were the people to take? Where did they get parachutes? Why do we even care at this point? We get some CGI monsters to add to the regular ones and Laurence Fishburne acting strange and eccentric while playing Mr. Exposition.Is any of this worth watching? Not for a minute.Frankly, We've been watching the predators do the same thing for four movies now. I'd like to see a movie where we see more of their homeworld and maybe a bit of their culture.

Predators supports a very similar premise to its predecessor and it shares its feel and look. It also boasts good performances and some very bloody action.
Great performaces from each actor with notable performaces from Adrein Brody (Royce) Academy Award for Best Actor, Alice Braga (I Am Legend) she is very sexy, Topher Grace (Edwin) and Lawrence Fishburne as Noland (Nightmare on Elm Street 3).If you liked the original, you'll get some heavy enjoyment outta this.

75,MBunge,It took them long enough,6,14 June 2011,"Well, it took them 23 years but they finally managed to make a decent sequel to one of the great sci-fi action flicks of the 1980s. Predators has the same sort of tension, violence and gore that made Predator such a thrill ride, but it rises above simply being a remake by adding just enough new twists and some superficial but satisfying depth to the same basic story.The plot is simple. A group of deadly warriors from all over Earth find themselves on an alien planet being hunted by vicious alien hunters. The human military, mercenary and criminal killers must band together to stay alive and find a way home. Along the way they discover some new information about the Predators and learn whether survival is best achieved by ruthless selfishness or through cooperation and sacrifice.So many awful sequels get made that putting together a good one is a commendable achievement. These filmmakers hit the perfect balance between echoing moments from the first film and spicing things up with something different. To start with, they utilize a much more colorful cast of characters who react to their threatening situation in different ways. So even when the story treads some familiar ground, it's not entirely the same. They also realize they can't just replay the same human vs. alien battle, so they supplement it with an internal conflict over how that battle should be fought. Can you defeat the Predators by being even more merciless and cruel or do you have to get beyond those primal instincts in order to triumph?Putting the philosophical aside, lots of stuff, people and aliens get shot up, stabbed, sliced, pummeled, burned and blown up in fine style. Each human is given a different weapon and a different approach to combat, giving the action scenes a lot of structure and style. The bloodthirst of the Predators is also put on display in all its R rated glory.There are also some very nice performances here for an action movie, particularly Adrien Brody playing the Arnold Schwarzenegger role. Yeah, that's right. Adrien freakin' Brody steps into Arnold's shoes. And yeah, I didn't think he could pull it off either but by the end of the film, you will believe Brody is a badass. Alice Braga as a resolute Israeli sniper, Walton Goggins as a death row convict and Topher Grace as a seemingly helpless doctor among so many dangerous warriors are also quite good.Now, Predators is an action movie, which means parts of it aren't going to hold up if you think too hard about them. And the new details revealed about the Predators themselves pales in comparison to what Aliens did with the creature from Alien. It's collective flaws, though, are minor in scope and importance.This is a good sequel AND a good action flick. Since most sequels fail at being either, Predators is clearly a step above and will reward you with a good time at the movies.",Predators
76,estebangonzalez10,"It's not great, but it's the best sequel of the franchise",6,31 July 2010,"¨They can hear you. Smell you. They see you.¨ One of the reasons Predators stands out from it's predecessors is because Robert Rodriguez was behind this project. His studio, Troublemaker Films, produced this movie in order for him to have controlling rights over it. His first decision was to sign Nimrod Antal as the director. Antal had directed Vacancy, Armored, and the movie that opened the doors for him in Hollywood: Hungarian film Control. Armored was a huge disappointment for me last year and a movie I really disliked, but Predatores was an improvement considering I went into it with very low expectations. Predators is much better than the AVP sequels or even the second predator film and it does the original 1987 movie justice. Of course it is not as good as the original movie because, well that one was original and we had never seen the predators before, but now we have been bombarded with them in four other movies and finally in this sequel the suspense is back and so is the fear of the unseen. The movie builds off very nicely from the beginning introducing each character and setting the mood of the film. The location chosen for filming was excellent and contributed to set the atmosphere. The screenplay for this movie was written by Alex Litvak and Michael Finch, but it was one of the weakest things about this movie which was full of cheesy dialogs and copied phrases from the original.The movie begins with Royce (Adrien Brody) falling from the sky into a jungle. His parachute opens up just in time, but he can't quite remember how he got to this place. He runs into another man who seems to have got there in the same conditions, Cuchillo (Danny Trejo), a member of a Mexican drug cartel. All of a sudden they begin to be shot at by a Russian Sptesnaz soldier named Nikolai (Oleg Taktarov), but Royce evades him and ends up pointing a gun at his face and letting him know that they are not the enemy. The three men run into an Israeli sniper named Isabelle (Alice Braga) who claims she has never been in a jungle like this one. They have all been parachuted from the sky and the last thing they remember is seeing a white light and then waking falling in the air into this mysterious place. Isabelle claims to have seen more parachutes fall near her so they continue to search for answers and run into two men fighting: Mombasa (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali), a revolutionary African fighter, and Stans (Walton Goggins), an inmate who was going to be sentenced to death in two days and a former FBI most wanted criminal. The six run into a Predator camp where they find all sort of dead body's which are kept as trophies and here they run into Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien) a Yakuza enforcer, and Edwin (Topher Grace), a doctor and the only one who doesn't seem to fit the profile of the group. They soon discover that they're not on their planet and that they have been brought here as game for hunters.The major difference this film has with the original is that no Arnold Schwarzenegger look a like is cast. Instead, Oscar award winner Adrien Brody was chosen for the lead and he did a pretty good job. Alicia Braga is also good in this film and is perhaps the most likable character. She makes a reference to the 87 movie mentioning how an elite military group was killed in the jungles of Guatemala by a creature similar to this. My favorite character however was the quiet and reserved Hanzo. The first half of this movie was excellent and did a great job of creating suspense, but the last half really let me down once Laurence Fishburne's character came into play. I really thought that his appearance was going to improve the movie, but the screenwriters really messed up from this point on. Once the predators are no longer hidden the movie losses that mystery, although the action is pretty entertaining. The major problem I found with the second part of the movie however was that several of the characters changed personalities from one moment to the next only to give the film a more dramatic effect. The first part of the film is worth 4 stars, while the second only 2 out of 5. Predators is a far better sequel than the other movies and can be enjoyed if taken lightly.",Predators

I also enjoyed Danny Trejo in another one of his stock roles, Topher Grace was a surprise and Laurence Fishburne who overacts his sole survivor breakdown.I can't comment about the franchise as a whole but I enjoyed this instalment; the premise was interesting, the alien was cool and there were some fantastic action scenes. The fight with the Yakuza gangster in the field stood out to me. A couple of twists along the way (sorta predictable) but I was still invested and entertained.I really liked the story especially the opening which sees a group of people (we later learn are mercenaries and convicts) parachuting onto a tropical alien planet.

I also like how this movie wasn't overly disgusting or too gory. The killings are well done and not too disturbingly violent. I think just about anyone except little kids obviously. Now, for the things I didn't care for or wish were different. Really the only thing I disliked about Predators was Adrien Brody. Don't get me wrong, he's a good actor, I just didn't think he fit the role well. I would've rather seen someone else in his role. He seemed a little out of his element.

82,I_Ailurophile,An outstanding thrill ride,10,21 May 2021,"'Predators' doesn't waste a single moment: The opening scene is a man falling through the sky as the ground rockets toward him. How's that for the start of a film?We're introduced to most of the characters rather immediately, within just the first 10 minutes - and within the next 10, given all the details we need of their backgrounds, and nearly complete information on the setting. It's a remarkable cast assembled for this action film. I mean, just look at the credits - Adrien Brody, Mahershala Ali, Topher Grace, Walter Goggins, Laurence Fishburne. Danny Trejo, too, because of course. I'm less familiar with Alice Braga, but she's great; likewise with Oleg Taktarov, and Louis Ozawa.The broad narrative thrust is one that should be familiar to anyone that's seen other 'Predator' films; we know the general course the plot is going to take. It's all a question of what the yautja's game is this time around, and how the protagonists will try to evade them. In those details, this movie is wildly exciting: I love every single moment of this.The action kicks up quickly after the impromptu exposition, and every cast member is up to the task. This is the most hard-boiled performance I think I've seen from anyone involved, an especial surprise coming from Adrien Brody and the eternally fresh-faced Topher Grace. Fast-moving as the movie may be, there's still plenty of room for suspense as the prey is hunted, and assesses their situation and their uniquely unfamiliar surroundings.Alex Litvak and Michael Finch poured a huge amount of detail and apparent research into their screenplay, and it pays off, as the story being told feels very real for the sake of that consideration. Set design, effects, and props lend aid to that same purpose; even as mere viewers we can practically feel the jungle around us, to say nothing of the tension in the atmosphere. The characters are given nary a moment to rest, and the audience doesn't get a breather, either. Even if we did, John Debney's riveting score keeps us on the edge of our seats just as thoroughly.Everyone in the cast is clearly eating up every bit of their roles, and the screenplay they've been given. I can only imagine this was an exhilarating movie to work on. And director Nimród Antal embraces that same spirit, capturing every detail in the setting, every nuance in the performances. There are some particularly exquisite shots he sets up at varying points, moments that are honestly beautiful. One doesn't expect this from an action flick, but here we are.Despite the familiarity, we still get some surprises; despite the peril of the scenario, there's still opportunity for a small measure of playfulness. I had some high expectations, and they were still well exceeded. Other long-running franchises have difficulties with trying to expand their lore, or become more grandiose with subsequent sequels, and lose sight of their core in the process. Meanwhile, even as effects grow more bombastic and the premises more inventive, the ongoing saga of the yautja remains intact - and there's a strength in that steadfastness to keep these movies grounded.Long story short, 'Predators' is a fantastic sci-fi action film - very worthy of the company it shares, and deserving of the attention of anyone remotely interested in this genre.Two bloody thumbs up!",Predators
83,TOMNEL,"Clichéd and silly, with underdeveloped characters and plot devices in a very entertaining film.",7,10 July 2010,"Going into this movie, you know this is going to be a sequel of Predator, so there isn't too much depth to expect from this, and it delivers the lack of depth I expected. In addition it also delivered it's fair share of clichés, corny lines, ""ten little indians"" plot set-up, and an hour and forty minutes of pure entertainment, with some pretty exciting action scenes and a lot of violence. A random assortment of confused people wake up mid-air to find that they are falling into a jungle with parachutes on their back. They all land confused and angry and ready to kill each other, but soon find that they have been abducted and taken to an alien gaming preserve where these tricky Predator creatures are playing games with an hunting down these humans. Each one of these humans were selected for who they are (mostly military men and people good with weapons), and these competent killers and tough guys strive to survive in this foreign jungle.If you have a hard time sitting through a feature length film, this might be the movie for you. By an hour in it feels like you've only been in the theater 30 minutes. Because this movie starts off right away in the middle of action, it never has any down time and this movie zooms right by at an hour and forty, and feels more like an hour long. The briskness in this case is a good thing, because the action scenes are quite close together and exciting, with moments in the middle to stop briefly to hear amusing dialogue and learn about our characters personalities.Adrien Brody doesn't seem much like an action hero normally, but here he is a pretty believable action star. He's a bit more beefed up than normal, and he's doing a Christian Bale Batman gravel voice like he's been smoking too much, and it's believable as are all the performances. Despite some occasional not great dialogue to deal with, the actors all play their characters well, including Laurence Fishbourne who plays a crazy character in what amounts to a lengthy cameo.The dialogue in this movie isn't great, and it's got a lot of clichéd lines in the style of ""If you want to kill me (long pause), then kill me."" or ""You think you're so tough (long pause), you're not!"" Neither of these lines are in the movie from my remembrance, but lots of half sentences, then pauses, then clichéd ends to the statements. In addition to that for some reason everyone listens to Adrien Brody and only talks when on cue to give a short line (very clichéd of one dimensional action flicks). Clichéd shots go by where we go past several Predators and as the camera passes each one they take their invisibility shield off, for some reason on cue with the camera movement. These clichéd lines and moments don't ruin the movie, but do add a few eye roll moments.Overall, this is a pretty effective Predator sequel. It has some cool action scenes, snappy characters and good special effects. The dialogue may be a bit contrived, and some weird camera direction used just to build hollow aesthetic pleasure, but this is still a very good sequel, and an entertaining action film that won't disappoint!My rating: *** out of ****. 107 mins. R for violence and language.",Predators
84,Jonny_Numb,The Somewhat Dangerous Game,5,18 July 2010,"Another day, another franchise reboot and/or remake. Being a relative novice in the ""Predator"" universe (I've seen the first in bits and pieces over the years, but never the sequel or the ""Aliens""-incorporating spinoffs), I went into the theater in a relative state of neutral expectations: the involvement of producer Robert Rodriguez (who knows a thing or two about injecting postmodern pop-culture trash with a heavy dose of fun), director Nimrod Antal (director of the nifty thriller ""Vacancy""), and star Adrien Brody held the promise of potentially great things. Yet, as seems to be the case with the endless final frontier of Hollywood recycling, ""Predators"" is not a bad film -- it's simply a consistently unremarkable one. Despite the advances in technology and cinematic technique since 1987's ""Predator,"" no amount of FX dazzle can cover up a common summer-blockbuster ailment: a lackluster script. Antal directs the proceedings with a sense of style and urgency, mustering up some suspense out of the inexplicable situation the characters are in: a disparate group of black-ops mercenaries and convicts find themselves in free-fall, landing in an undefined jungle, hunted by the unseen titular characters. Some of the sets are a stunning return to the H.R. Giger-esquire designs of ""Alien,"" and the use of CGI is admirably restrained. Yet underneath all the gloss, the Michael Finch/Alex Litvak script is not one of high-concept ideas; most of the time, our characters are reduced to spitting out clichéd tough-talk in tandem with bullets, and the action (while well-choreographed) is numbingly conventional. Like this year's remake of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" ""Predators"" is too concerned about rocking the boat and offending its built-in fan base to be bothered with matters of freshness and originality.",Predators

I love the idea of this supreme, extraterrestrial hunter badass but the movies are always just kinda meh to me. Take this one, I just watched it maybe two days ago? Barely remember it. Some people get magically yanked from Earth to Predator game reserve and have to survive. That's about it. Also, I don't really buy this super tough guy mercenary Brody, just not working for me.Gonna give it credit for being a passable movie with Predators but beyond that I just don't think it's all that memorable.",Predators
86,adamjohns-42575,Who's hunting who?,2,19 November 2020,"With vast similarities to Jurassic Park III this film comes nowhere close to its excellence. It's like they were trying to make a film just to keep Predator in the public eye (I bet he complained to his agent after this).
The story was very simplistic and didn't really give the thrill of even 'Predator 2'.Also, I don't care if Adrien spent all year in the gym and got himself a gruff voice, I could not buy in to him as an action hero.It's easy to predict who will survive in the end and the Predator Dogs just cheapened it further. There are also lots of secrets surrounding everyone's identities that don't really get explored enough. That might have made it a bit more interesting?As a scaredy cat, I wasn't even slightly afraid. In fact I've always thought that Predator was a bit camp and in this one they seem to be a bit mincey too! Not the tough guy aliens I switched on to see.If I'm trying to find a positive, I would say that Laurence Fishburne played his part well for the whole two minutes that he was on screen.",Predators
87,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Predators (2010),7,26 December 2011,"I never understood the fascination of combining the Alien and Predator franchises. To me, Alien was always a genuine masterpiece, as were its first 2 sequels. Predator was just an action movie set in a jungle. A damn good one, but still. After the failure of the AvP films, Rodriguez and Antal bring Predator back to its jungle roots. A bunch of killers, soldiers and a doctor, wake in a jungle and are hunted. It's just that simple. Predators excels in the action scenes, and the ability to create tension, despite the mystery of the hunters being known to us. It gradually expands on the original, but not enough to alienate new viewers. I loved Brody's character, finally an action guy who will do the smart thing and leave the wounded behind, and use people as bait. The rest of the cast are pretty much summed up by their ethnicities or nationalities. Grace is an interesting inclusion as a doctor, but he never uses his doctor skills. There is also a last minute twist that adds nothing to the film. In fact, it becomes a cringe worthy addition. I've heard numerous complaints from hardcore fans, but I enjoyed every minute. CGI dogs and samurai inspired sword-fights included.",Predators
88,Easygoer10,Pretty Good,7,5 May 2019,"I liked this film better than ""Predator 2"", even though the cast is not quite as good.. I still thought the casting in this film was very good; especially Adrien Brody. He was perfect for his role, too. My favorite scene is when ""Hanzo"" has the ""Samurai"" swordfight.with the ""Beserker Predator"". The weakest part is Topher Grace's. Audiences smell out something not authentic fast. He is that guy. The film would have been better off leaving him out, but they wanted a little ""thing"" between ""Royce"" (Brody) and ""Isabelle"" (Alice Braga). That's the only reason. Other than this, it's pretty good, all things considered.",Predators
89,Rob_Taylor,So much better than I had feared.,8,12 May 2011,"Some films, I have to say, get hyped-up beyond their ability to deliver. It's as if the marketing people have a mindset that tells them ""You must tell everyone how fantastic this movie will be! You must!"" We get the endless succession of teasers and trailers that, pretty much, show all the good bits in the film. So it really isn't a big ""Who woulda thunk it?"" moment when we watch the film and realise it's not lived up to our expectations.So when Predators was announced, I dutifully watched said trailers, realised it was Predator rehashed with different actors, and uttered a large ""Meh!"" of disappointment, expecting it to be awful.However, I can say that (and this is rare these days!) I was very pleasantly surprised.Yes, it is Predator pretty much. But within that basic plot outline, it carries itself very well and never once drags or falls over. There are no awful performances and whilst many scenes are terribly predictable, they are played out with confidence and style.Whereas Predator was a larger-than-life, almost pulp-hero movie, this aims itself more towards realism. It comes at the story from a slightly different angle, in other words.In the Aliens and Predators franchise (which seem to have merged these days) it is one of the stronger entries, and well worth a look-in if your even slightly interested in the setting. In fact, it would serve as rather a good introduction in its own right.My only minor gripe is the seeming need for both of these franchises to introduce new ""tougher"" versions of Aliens or Predators with each new movie. Here, at least, it's not too much more. But still....why? However, that aside, the movie is most definitely recommended.",Predators
90,Sandcooler,Great dumb fun,8,10 August 2014,"If I just give you the character list, I'm pretty sure the movie is summed up pretty well: you have rugged guy who may have a soft side (Adrien Brody hits a slightly different tone than he did in ""The Pianist""), mysterious girl, wimpy guy who doesn't belong there, big-mouthed guy who's isn't afraid of anything (but should be), Asian man who doesn't speak English until the script says so, Danny Trejo, this isn't exactly the most complex movie. It's a bunch of cardboard cut-outs shooting and getting killed for 100 minutes, but it's filmed so well and moves at such great pace that it almost rivals the Schwarzenegger ""Predator"". The special effects look great, there are some pretty creative set pieces (the scene with the samurai sword is great, guess who uses it) and unexpected twists, it's just highly entertaining if you just see it for what it is. Excellent piece of camp.",Predators
91,Matt_Layden,"So Close, Yet So Far.",6,11 December 2010,"A group of people are dropped into a planet as a part of a game. Kill or be killed. There's a small snag though, the other team are an alien race with advanced technology and a vagina mouth. There was no chance that this film was going to be better, or even match the original. I did have my hopes for it to be better than the 2nd outing, and all the alien vs predator garbage that came after that. So in the end, I got what I wanted. Yet the film manages to fall short of it's own expectations. Adrian Brody did try his best to be an Arnold fill in, sorry to say it didn't work. He tried to be tough by getting a deeper voice and getting the chance to rip off his top and show off his oh so sexy abs. Taking a page out of the original, which this film mentions, Brody runs around covered in mud and does what he can to try and be a bad ass. The premise of the film is better than the final product. We have Predators, which we know are bad ass, then we have a team of highly trained and skillful people dropped on this planet. Each have their own specialty. So, that was cool in itself. Yet every death scene lacked spark, originality and the coolness that it should have had. The most interesting part of the film to me was equally the silliest. When a Predator and a Yakuzza member, have a so called ""sword"" fight.For me the film fell apart with the introduction of Lawrence Fishburn. From then on, it was all downhill. I particularly didn't like how some characters suddenly changed at the end and out of nowhere a new subplot pops up. It was distracting and not true to the rest of the film. A predictable and poor ending hurt the film even more. Rodriguez should have directed instead of producing and maybe we could have had a more interesting film on our hands.",Predators

We've got Danny Trejo, Alice Braga, Adrien Brody, and a few less familiar faces (and a surprising cameo), all pitted against a trio of Predators on their home turf. As you'd expect from that scenario, a lot of humans end up good and dead. But, will they take the Predators with them? Will any of our protagonists survive?I'm by no means a big fan of the Predators franchise, but I do appreciate some straightforward action from time to time. Straightforward action describes Predators pretty aptly. Antal and Rodriguez try to spice things up with a few twists and turns, but really this movie is just a few humans attempting to survive against a superior force and find a way back to earth. If that sounds good to you, give this a try. Predators isn't an action masterpiece or anything like that, but it's solid.",Predators
93,brando647,Much Stronger Sequel Than 1990's PREDATOR 2,8,15 November 2010,"I've known people who've complained about this film and that it's nothing more than a bunch of people being slaughtered one at a time by an alien. My response: so what? That's what the franchise is all about...one of the coolest science fiction cinema creations hunting and killing people in graphically violent ways. When you decide to watch a Predator film, you know what you're in for. PREDATORS is no different. A random assortment of Earth's best killers are collected and dropped on a Predator game preserve where they're hunted by a team of three high-tech alien hunters.With the first film in the jungles of Central America and the second film bringing the hunter to urban Los Angeles, the new film brings us to the next logical location: another planet. The film also ups the ante by using a team of three Predators as opposed to the usual solo hunter. Each of the aliens has their own unique style and all of them look equally awesome. The special effects in the film are great and the creature effects are the best so far, with one exception. The ""Predator dogs"" are full CG and most of the time, they came off as too fake and they stood out. Thankfully, they're only used in one scene and they're not around long enough to weaken the film.As with any slasher-style film, most of the human element are going to be under-developed cannon fodder. Each of the characters receive just enough characterization to distinguish themselves from one another and to hint at their specializations: ex-Special Forces merc, death row inmate, cartel enforcer, etc. The film probably wouldn't have been as entertaining if they'd casted poorly (e.g. AVP). I was hesitant when I'd read that Adrien Brody had been cast as the film's lead (Royce) but I was happy to find he gave a strong performance as the film's lead ""tough guy"" and I could actually believe him in the role. I had the same confusion over Topher Grace's involvement as Edwin, a doctor that had been dropped with the humans, but he did well enough, even if his character felt completely out of place (even after his big reveal at the end). Oleg Taktarov was one of my favorite team members as the Russian Nikolai and Laurence Fishburne's cameo was one of the coolest parts of the film. I loved his stress-induced psychosis and his chats with his imaginary friend; it was a fun pause in the action.One of the best elements of the film was that, in a time when studios are making hardcore franchises into PG-13 cash-cows, it kept it's hard R rating. The kills are graphic and the battles are awesome. It's great that they weren't required to pull any punches. Honestly, I know I'm probably a minority in my opinion but I thought this film (directed by Nimród Antal) was the strongest since John McTiernan's 1987 original. The film did well enough at the box office that I'm hopeful for another, but only as long as they find another interesting direction to take the film in.",Predators
94,moviewizguy,Fear is Reborn,7,10 July 2010,"Royce is a mercenary who reluctantly leads a group of elite warriors who come to realize they've been brought together on an alien planet...as prey. With the exception of a disgraced physician, they are all cold-blooded killers – mercenaries, Yakuza, convicts, death squad members – human ""predators"" that are now being systemically hunted and eliminated by a new breed of alien Predators. (20th Century Fox)PREDATORS brings back everything to the basics. It doesn't take place in an urban city. It doesn't take place in an Aztec pyramid in the middle of Alaska. And it doesn't take place in a small town. Just like the original film, it takes place in a jungle where this group of people must survive. And let me say this now, PREDATORS managed to do something the original film failed to do: Create suspense. And it is this very reason that PREDATORS is easily the best in the franchise.This film plays out almost exactly like PREDATOR, but with director Nimród Antal's sharp direction, it's better executed and infinitely more exciting. For the first time in my life, I was actually freaked out by a Predator, and I just loved that! Sure, it took them at five tries to get it right (including the AVP films), but it's better now than never. I was in the edge of my seats in some very intense scenes and the film also manages to bring in a few surprises.I also cared for the characters this time around. Adrien Brody beefed up for the Schwarzenegger role and he plays the action hero role really well. You might not notice this but Topher Grace stars in a supporting role. I really liked his character a lot, playing the nerd. Alice Braga may seem like another Anna from the original film but she has a lot more to do around here. She plays a really sympathetic yet bad ass character. Laurence Fishburne, on the other hand, is a hit or miss. He played his character a bit too weird and laughable, in my opinion, and his clichéd lines certainly didn't help.The action sequences are also well made, along with the visual effects. One thing I like to give a shout out to is the make-up department because I really liked the new Predator designs (along with the original Predator, of course). There's also the addition of Predator dogs, which I really loved. John Debney replaces Alan Silvestri as the film's composer but those who loved the original film will love the return of most of the original film's score. Gotta love those beating drums.I may be in the minority when I say PREDATORS is better than the original film, but I do know that I am not the only person to like this film. Director Nimród Antal is quickly becoming one of the more promising filmmakers of this generation (any love for VACANCY, anyone?). Fans of the original will love the references to PREDATOR and will find this film to be the ""true"" sequel, no doubt. I think it's great to finally see a Predator film that is exciting, tense, and filled with suspense and great action scenes.",Predators

The ones who used to hunt men here on earth for a myriad of reasons now find themselves being the hunted by alien Predators who use a cloaking device to make themselves invisible. We see various trained killers, soldiers of fortune, other mercenaries, a Yukuza member, a convict who was just about to be executed for murder, an IDL member, and a doctor. You will just have to see the movie to find out why he was included.This was okay, but not as good as the 1987 Predator with Arnold. That is still the standard. In this version there is much more language and, of course, the ever present CGI, which is pretty good as were some non-CGI stunts. This movie did make a passing reference to the 1987 Predator. The reference was nice to hear. Cudos !All the action takes place in a jungle and the color greens are nothing but fantastic. How do they do that? What type fertilizer do they use?As I have mentioned in previous reviews where machine guns were involved: no one in a Hollywood movie has been able to hit anything from about 10-feet away with a machine gun. Same thing here. Go figure. But, it would have been nice to have had that brass contract. To be honest this was not scary, and there wasn't too much tension although the characters did try. But, we knew there was a camera on them. They knew it too. And, that is what hurt this version. But, all in all, this was still entertaining. We kept hoping that the good Predators (Didn't I mention there are good ones? Sorry) would man up and help the crew make some sense of all this. Near the end there was a fight between a good Predator and a bad one and I have no idea exactly who won. They should have had the bad Predator wear a black hat or something. So there is some confusion near the end and you will just have to wait it out and see for yourself. Actually, I am still not sure..somewhat. Now, you might ask, how did the people from Earth get to this unnamed planet? They sort of just. dropped in. HA !Violence: Yes.

(R)Several strangers awaken while being dropped onto an unknown planet, each of them specializing in combat/bloodshed (mercenary, sniper, cartel enforcer, etc.); initially distrustful of each other, they're eventually forced to band together against an even deadlier threat--Predator aliens on the hunt. Decent attempt to revitalize the series has a promising premise and enough energy and style to keep things moving at a nice clip (aside from an overlong sequence with Fishburne that derails momentum). Tough guy posturing allows for very little character depth or interest, and the order in which they'll be picked off is predictable; Grace's motivations are dubious, but Brody makes for a surprisingly effective action hero. If the action beats weren't so mechanical, real suspense might have been accumulated; instead, the film emerges as a routine action-horror hybrid with scattershot highlights. Robert Rodriguez, credited as an executive producer, wrote the original script for a third ""Predator"" movie back in the 1990s, his core concept being used as part of a rewrite here by Michael Finch and Alex Litvak; in said rewrite, Trejo's character was described as someone who ""looks like Danny Trejo""--what luck he was available!55/100",Predators

Then once he touches the land, we start meeting other characters and it becomes understandable that they all have been chosen for their previous devious past. The action and mystery doesn't stop their and even we know its predators still we want to wonder what they are up against. The sequence where all survivors find out that it's not Earth and some other planet is the best scene in the movie. The whole movie goes on with quite different approach then its predecessors though the last 30 minutes were pretty predictable and fight between two predators was seen before too. Though, eventually they gave a different touch by involving Alice Braga, Adrien Brody & Topher Grace into each other. For the 1st time in his movie career I actually liked Adrien Brody A lot, though he did a great job in The Pianist and a fine job in The Experiment.

It was also great when they were all standing around and suddenly they hear the words ""OVER HERE"". That's when the amazing Larry Fishburn made his cameo. I was surprised that Larry didn't have more of a role. Danny Trejo certainly delivered the goods. When Danny Trejo started yelling for help, I knew that something was up. The tough guy act that Brody put on was pretty lame. I was sickened when he said SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR LITTLE FRIEND. That was a nod to Scarface obviously but WHY? Also, did anybody notice that Arnold was not IN this movie? I was surprised that he didn't at least get a mention by name. It would have been nice if somebody would have said that they were from a Dutch community in New Jersey or at least SOME nod to him instead of Al Pacino. I can't figure that one out.

100,Troy_Campbell,"Sit back, put your feet up and enjoy the bloody ride.",7,10 July 2010,"This Robert Rodriguez production is essentially a remake, but perhaps the term 'update' would be more accurate, because although Predators has the heart of the classic Arnie vehicle of 1987 it has the mind of a modern action flick. The standards and staples of the genre have changed dramatically – you no longer need freakishly muscular units like Arnie and Jesse Ventura as your heroes for instance – and director Antal keeps in tune, without losing the nostalgia a film like this brings to the table. Antal capably harks back to the original with a clever pinch of dialogue here, a knowing wink to a weapon there, but thankfully without ever relying on its 'action classic' tag to generate the thrills for him.Despite being predictable every now and then – the order in which the cast are dispatched is mind-numbingly obvious – and delivering the occasional corny moment or ludicrous plot hole – Hanzo's heroic choice of timing is unintentionally laughable – Predators features a plethora of entertainingly gory and brutal set pieces to sate your action appetite. The jungle habitat is ripe for inconsequential violence and Antal doesn't disappoint; each sequence has its very own gruesome denouement. Granted, the first half of the picture just offers multiple scenes of the group running for dear life, but when the action kicks up a gear near the midway point it never lets up until the closing credits. Gyula Pados' grimy, understated cinematography is worth noting too, it sets the unrelenting and foreboding mood wonderfully.Schwarzenegger's replacement, Adrien Brody, is quite possibly the last man you would consider for the lead role as a hard-as-nails soldier yet the Oscar-winner manages to make it plausible, partly thanks to a heavily-cut build you wouldn't think achievable on the normally weedy thespian. Ironically enough it's when he's required to act the most that something's missing, his chemistry on screen with Alice Braga, the other major player, fails to convince. The remaining cast members do what they can with their stereotypical roles; Braga represents the Y chromosome fairly well, the devilish-looking Goggins is the source for some insane, and almost offensive, humour whilst Morpheus himself has an extended cameo that spices things up.But what about the Predators I hear you ask? Have they made a joke of the iconic beast a la those ridiculous Alien vs Predators mash-ups? No, they haven't. With an intelligent blend of CGI and practical effects, the alien creatures are vicious, ferocious and cool to boot. It's evident that a lot of time and effort went in to finding that perfect balance between evoking nostalgia yet creating something fresh, and it pays off in the end. However, the less said about the suss CGI Predator-dogs the better.Sit back, put your feet up and enjoy the bloody ride.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",Predators
101,dunmore_ego,Roaring Ripping Rending Rebirth!,7,29 July 2011,"At last - the sequel to PREDATOR we've been waiting for!With the internet ablaze with derogation over the casting of Adrien Brody in the lead role (purely because action fans cannot comprehend life after Arnold), and the B-movie schlock of the ALIEN VS. PREDATOR movies sullying DVD rental racks around the planet, it would seem PREDATORS had little chance of being taken seriously by moviegoers or the men who make movies. But Robert Rodriguez (producer) and Nimród Antal (director) have bowed their heads in fealty to the legendary 1987 PREDATOR film, shinked out their arm-talons and ripped forth a roaring rebirth for the franchise. PREDATORS starts in free fall - literally - as eight nameless characters drop from the sky into a mysterious jungle. They're all the best ""predators"" in their killing fields. They discover they're on another planet - a grand vista of three gigantic moons in the sky and a sun that ""hasn't moved since we got here"" tipping them off.And they're being hunted by something. The planet is a game preserve and they've been dropped here for sport. The over-arching theme, which is sometimes used as the embarrassing tagline: ""When the predators become the prey."" Oh, I feel dirty. Adrien Brody, an American Special Ops merc, is the tacit leader and therefore has to put on the raspiest voice. There is the Russian Special Forces soldier (Oleg Taktarov), a Mexican drug enforcer (Danny Trejo), a Yakuza (Louis Ozawa Changchien), a Sierra Leone soldier (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali), an Israeli sniper (Alice Braga), a death row inmate (Walton Goggins) and a disgraced bean stem of a doctor (Topher Grace).Luckily, Brody has read the script and rasps the exposition above. But you don't need the script if you've got someone who saw PREDATOR; Alice Braga recounts the story of the Special Forces guy (that would be Arnold, fanboys) who killed one of the hunters and described its proclivities. Can't help feeling the cast is a *leetle* too international for the sake of worldwide box office - or maybe they're just auditioning for a crowd of passengers in another SPEED movie.First act is tight, effective screen writing; characters introduced smartly, situation assimilated; inexplicable jungle mystery, thriller, action, even some horror. All the classic story elements that made PREDATOR so good. PREDATORS reminds us of ALIEN 3: back to basics to bring the solemnity under control again. Suddenly - Laurence Fishburne. A surprise cameo, an eccentric old hermit, well-built, brain-fried, and whispering in that Morpheus velvet about surviving for ten seasons. He reveals the Predator hunting party travels in threes.And then in maximum cool - we meet The Predators... They're played by Carey Jones, Brian Steele and Derek Mears, and they've been given names by the filmmakers that we discover only by reading the credits: the captive, strung-up Predator is Classic Predator; the leader of the three hunters is Berserker, larger and scarier than Tracker and Falconer. The armor and headgear of these new Predators is akin to the development of Batman's suits; more jagged and streamlined than previous versions. Makeup by Greg Nicotera and Howard Berger goes above and beyond the call of B-Movie duty. Like the rest of the production, they're taking it very seriously indeed. There are numerous homages to PREDATOR, creatively intertwined into this tale. There are the interesting twists of character, and even a grand moral dilemma: when Topher is injured, rather than carrying him as dead weight, Brody decides, ""We leave him as a booby trap."" When Alice protests, he elucidates on how the Predators maimed Topher to slow down the fleeing humans, knowing they would carry him, ""They're banking on us being human."" I love the smell of sociopath in the morning.And when Yakuza finds a samurai sword, we know there must be a reckoning - between an arm-bladed Predator and Yakuza getting' his Toshiro Mifune on. Like Billy on the log, Yakuza stops in a field as the rest of the humans continue to flee. He turns to face the oncoming Pred, who, true to form, decides to grant his prey the courtesy of a ""fair"" battle... as he shinks out his arm-talons... It seems Predators are taken down not by their superior technology or weaponry, which, if utilized judiciously, can take down any prey in the galaxy - they are done in by their own hubris! Brody (covered in mud like Arnold) goes mano a mano against the last Berserker; when the Pred could easily shoot Brody as he lies squirming on the ground, he opts to grab Brody by the neck and throw him. Even picking Brody up by the neck could warrant an efficient killing stroke if the Pred just shinks his arm-talons up through Brody's throat. Nope. They take toying with their prey to new levels of carelessness. It's almost as if the words of the Little Richard song reflect the taunting hubris of the Predators, ""We're gonna have some fun tonight - whooo!/ We're gonna have some fun tonight - whooo!/ Have some fun, havin' me some fun tonight!""-- Oops! Blown up by humans again! Whooo!",Predators
102,oneguyrambling,They'll keep making 'em while suckers like us keep paying to watch 'em.,6,17 December 2010,"Before I discuss the good points that made Predators an enjoyable couple of hours I must address some gaping holes in logic that I simply could not ignore.1/ The movie opens with all human characters being dropped into a harsh jungle environment while unconscious. Those that wake up and fumble for a parachute they did not know they had survive, at least initially. Those that don't go kersplat. Given the purpose of the human cargo this would seem counter-intuitive to the grand plan, if you plan to use something you at least show a little more care initially.2/ (This happens a lot in films lately.) Attacking creatures can take a number of bullets with only a jolt or a spot of blood indicating they were even hit, except on occasion:* A bullet hits a weak point or sweet spot,* A super-bullet is fired,* They reach a tolerance level and can simply take no more...... and they flat-out explode in a tornado of flesh and blood which looks OK on screen but makes no sense. This happens to both creature and human so it is not a result of shoddy DNA.3/ The entire film utilises a jungle setting, which is cool, after all so did the first. I would argue though that it might take a little more than seeing a couple more moons than normal in the sky to expect a worldwide audience to swallow this ""fact"". I mean if you were on the planet fine no probs... But finding a planet with terrain exactly the same as vast areas of Earth, with a breathable atmosphere, drinking water and all the same properties, show me more than a couple of moons please.But just because these things annoyed me doesn't mean it is a bad movie, just a reasonable one with plot holes. To enjoy the film more perhaps you can ignore those things above. You can overthink these things to your own detriment I guess, as one guy in the foyer post film said ""Yeah but how did they capture all the humans without waking them?""Yeah, that's the unbelievable part, not the crabfaced creatures with green blood hunting humans on an alien planet.All that said I liked Predators, it was harmless fun. It reminded me of the sequels to The Descent and Tremors, nothing really new aside from some tweaks to the cast and creatures, but familiar fun.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++So the Predators decided they had enough frequent flyer miles and started bringing their prey to them. Obviously sourced from all over the shop the new ""meat"" is shipped in seasonally and then systematically hunted down by three-man teams of predator creatures. This particular batch includes a bunch of humans from all over the planet - we have mercenaries, freedom fighters, assassins and cold blooded killers, even a Yakuza. All of them are varying degrees of dangerous, thus providing the predators with a challenge.After being given a little while to acclimatise the predators set about learning about their new prey by watching them from afar and testing them out with various methods including siccing the many-horned exploding attack dogs on them, setting up the ""bird with the broken wing"" technique and by trying to divide them up to wipe out the small groups left over.Adrien Brody is one of the humans, he notices things long before anyone else, the terrain, the tactics, even the weaponry they are up against, perhaps John Edwards should see if he was a predator in a former life? The one thing Brody is not is a friendly team player, he is out for #1 and only seeks or gives assistance when it suits him. There are seven humans to start with, then as you might guess less as the film progresses. (After 5 minutes you have a pretty good idea of who will be around until near the credits.)After a few brief encounters with the Predators a long-time survivor first-time helper emerges from nowhere to provide some plot development. Somewhat of a hermit, the man tells those left just how he has managed to avoid capture or worse for so long, he even takes them to his hideout and explains that there are two different types of predators, that the two types don't like each other, and how they operate to most effectively wipe out their targets. Then the Hermit does something so boneheaded and out of character that it makes no sense whatsoever... (I'll address this after some spoiler warnings at the end of the review.)So Brody and his Brody-buddies run around trying various things to avoid detection and death, ultimately deciding on a risky plan to escape. There are multiple scenes and bits straight lifted from the first film, at one point the guy I was there with leaned over and said ""Here comes the Billy part"", seconds later he was proved absolutely spot on. (Which makes it especially lucky that a Yakuza guy was able to find an ancient samurai sword shortly before on this barren alien planet!)None of the kills are particularly inventive, and a newly-ripped Brody switches to action hero mode by making his voice a little raspy - not Batman-raspy, just I have the flu raspy. The rest of the humans are generic predator fodder. The only one worthy of mention in a hardened death row crim, whose unsavoury comments and desires repeatedly raised the eyebrows.Final Rating - 7 / 10. This will not change your life, it won't even change your weekend. But on the night you watch it you might feel a little better than you did before.",Predators
103,Pumpkin_Man,An Awesome Worthy Sequel!!!,8,13 July 2010,"This was a very decent sequel to the original 1987 film. It reminded me a lot of a story called 'The Most Dangerous Game' but it's on the planet of the Predators. Soldiers, drug dealers, a convict, and a doctor are all brought to another planet and are being hunted down by the Predators. They don't trust each other at first, but they soon must work together to survive. The Predators have a new look, and they're tougher and badder than ever. Not only must they deal with the Predators, they must deal with booby-traps, dog-like alien creatures, and a deranged Soldier named Noland.

104,Angelus2,Back to Basics,8,25 February 2011,"A group of soldiers and criminals find themselves dropped on a distant planet that resembles Earth's jungles and forests. As the group search for a way out they realise that something is hunting them in the shadows.After the disastrous 'Alien Vs Predator' movies, it's nice to see the franchise revived that resembles the Arnie movies. There are moments of dread as we await the arrival of the Predator, knowing what the characters do not...its quite nerve-wracking. Adrian Brody takes on the role of the action hero quite well, I guess he developed a taste for it during King Kong, his voice alone makes you believe he's tough enough to lay waste to anything that comes his way, Alice Braga from 'City of God' does a good job.I loved the scene in which Royce says, ""I'm not a good man. But I'm a fast man."" before he kills his attacker with one swift movement. Quite unexpected. And the Predator vs Predator was epic, I'm not just throwing that word around...Honestly it is 'EPIC', as the true Predator tackles what appears to be a 'Alien/Predator' hybrid to the ground and lays the beating. The one thing I did not quite like was Laurence Fishburne's character..I understand his vital role in the film, the explainer of things unexplained...But I wished that the group could have figured it out on their own.Now I want to see another.",Predators
105,antoniotierno,a film standing on its own,6,31 July 2010,"Frankly, without knowing the original 1987 classic Predator, it's easy to miss half the gags in this remake. As the story starts, you have a déjà vu sensation, not only for the plot but for the whole atmosphere as well. The jungle is of course a giant game preserve and they have been chosen as a game, being chased by the Predators. In essence every time you see some sequences there's something reminding the old flick. But though the movie will laugh at itself, its sense of humour clashes a bit with its more serious moments and parts. When the story is on its way and we start knowing the characters, we learn nothing at all about them, so it's quite useless. And considering it is such a ""for the fans"" movie, anyone who knows the game will be able to predict just about every twist and turn well ahead of time, which actually makes the experience kind of dull. The action sequences, however, are really impressive, also the samurai versus predator scene, filmed in the samurai style movie. As said the plot is densely packed with references to the original movies and shows a nice cameo from Laurence Fishburne balancing out some of the other thin characterizations of the other roles.",Predators
106,TheUnknown837-1,"""Predators"" is a well-made, stimulating and straightforward summer matinée just like the original, which at last has the sequel it deserves",7,13 July 2010,"Initially I thought it was very unimaginative for the filmmakers to title their new movie ""Predators."" It makes it sound even less intelligent and elaborate than the first sequel, ""Predator 2"" released in 1990. But now, looking back on the film, I see it as appropriate. Consider Ridley Scott's iconic 1979 horror film ""Alien."" It was followed by another masterpiece where they also only added an S to the end: ""Aliens."" That film was the true sequel to the classic and the others in the saga really were not on the same tier. The same applies with the Predator franchise. The first movie from 1987 and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger has gone on to become a cult classic because of its sheer stimulating excitement. But it has since been followed by sequels and spin-offs ranging from the mediocre ""Predator 2"" to the abysmal ""AVPR: Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem,"" the movie where apparently nobody ever heard of a light bulb.But here at last we not only get a movie that resembles (visually) the first movie, but feels like a true sequel. There is not very much of a plot and there's even less of a story, but strangely enough, that is not needed with this type of film. The makers of the movie realize that they cannot top the classic and that if they try to expand too much on the franchise, they will overload it. So wisely, they develop an intricate setup and right from there, play it as a straight-forward, high-tense, elaborate summer thriller, just like the original.The movie stars Adrien Brody as a mercenary who, along with several other people including a drug lord, a death row inmate, and a sniper played by Alice Braga, finds himself one minute in his regular life and the next falling through space and landing on a planet that resembles Earth but is inhabited by a race of humanoids called the Predators, who just like the creature from the original movie, would rather kill than do anything else and have chosen to capture these individuals for the sheer sport of hunting and killing a tough opponent. From here, it's pretty straightforward.And it's appropriate that it is. Now ""Predators"" is not exactly a significant movie other than the fact that it triumphs over all between it and the original. But it is a quintessentially exciting middle-of-the-road summer matinée with an extraordinary cast of gifted actors and handled by a competent action director. We have several scenes that, in the hands of lesser people, would have been dreadful, but end up truly stimulating. And save for a ridiculous and pointless step-off with Laurence Fishburne, it never falters in its running time as it simply keeps on the move toward its very effective, but not completely disclosure of an ending, a tactic I very much appreciate. And fans of the original will also have lots of fun with the homage and references to their old-time favorite. In the past movies, especially ""AVPR"", the homage was blatant, unimaginative, and overdone, but here, it is respectable and fun.When I heard that Adrien Brody was going to star in the movie, I was a bit unsure. Brody is one of the finest actors of today, but I had only seen him play sentimental roles before in movies such as ""The Pianist."" I wasn't sure how he could handle a role like this. But by Jove, he plays the movie tough guy with conviction, charisma, and presence. His performance in ""Predators"" only furthers the evidence of his skill and professionalism as an actor. Another effective screen presence is Alice Braga, who you remember as the survivalist in ""I am Legend,"" playing a sniper with a heart. Laurence Fishburne, though his character is completely unnecessary, is also very good as are the rest of the cast. Also effective are the Predators themselves, who are well-realized using some CGI effects, I think, and some traditional men in suits. I appreciate this tactic because after a while, constant use of CGI will ruin the illusion that there really is a creature there in front of the screen. By blending the elements together, with caution and precision, it works masterfully.At last the 1987 classic has been followed up faithfully. ""Predators"" is not a great movie nor will it be immortalized like its predecessor, but for a summer thriller, it is very good. It only makes one irritating mistake, toward the end, when it transitions into a roaring song that fans of the original will recognize is a heartbeat.",Predators
107,sarastro7,"Get real, people! This is AWFUL!",3,8 July 2010,"Predators is awful. The characters aren't compelling in the least (there is practically no characterization), there's no meat on the bones of the story, no cool one-liners, no self-irony or campiness (as in the original), and several scenes are blatant reshoots of scenes from the original movie. This is so bad, and so predictable.But let me clamp down on two of the biggest plot holes. Most people wouldn't notice them, but they bother me a lot:1) Earth plants on another planet? Was this ""game reserve"" built by transporting Earth plants to this world? Would the predators go that far? And if so, wouldn't they use it very exclusively for hunting prey? But no, they are also involved in their own blood feud in the same place, suggesting that this is their own habitat and *not* an artificial game reserve - in which case there can't be Earth plants. Sure, there are possible explanations, but the movie doesn't provide any.2) The cosmic panorama. Doesn't make any sense. First, they have clear sky above them before they reach the valley and see the cosmic skyline. They notice earlier that the sun doesn't move. Where was the cosmic skyline then? Second, at least one of the nearby planets is a gas giant, suggesting that our characters are located on one of its moons. Only, on an orbiting moon, the sun wouldn't be standing still above their heads. No possible combination of factors make sense here.3) Just adding a gratuitous third gripe, though it's not specifically a plot hole, but annoying just the same because nothing is explained: The ending! They just go, ""Let's get off this planet"". But there's no clear way that's at all possible. So there is no real ending. That is intensely annoying. The incompetent makers of this movie are not treating space-travel as the big deal that it is.Huge disappointment. Commercial claptrap with no passion and no intelligence and no proper sci-fi. Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.I'm done.",Predators
108,hnt_dnl,"Awful continuation of the ""Predator"" franchise!",2,6 July 2014,"With some hesitation and reservations, I finally got around to watching PREDATORS (2010). I heard some good things about it, in particular that star Adrien Brody did a good job as the tough guy action hero of the flick. Right off the bat, I'll say that I was rather annoyed by Brody's performance, which I found to be an awkward combination of Clint Eastwood and Bruce Willis, only a LOT more mouthy than both of them put together! Whenever his character started talking, I found myself tuning out more often than not. And the supporting characters weren't much better. There was an inordinate amount of cliché dialog where I kept thinking to myself, ""Thanks for that insight, Captain Obvious!"" I could literally tell sometimes what characters were going to say before they said it. There is some really awful acting in this. All of the characters are essentially stereotypical ripoffs from the 1987 film, but merged into multiple characters. Brody is basically a combination of Dutch and Dillon. The lead (and sole) female character played by Alice Braga, who sounds like she's reading her lines off of a cue card, is the ""Anna"" of the story, the hot Latino female, who somehow KNOWS what's going on; but in the original, Anna was more mercurial and interesting, while Braga can't shut up! Then there's Topher Grace (playing a useless ""doctor"" and who channels too much of his Eric Forman character from ""70s Show"") and Walter Goggins (a pain-in-the-ass prisoner) who combine for the ""Poncho"" comic relief role. Why is Grace's character even in this? Mahershala Ali (an imposing-looking yet surprisingly meek soldier) is ""Mac"" and Louis Ozawa Changchien (an apparently mute Japanese gangster) is the mystical warrior ""Billy"" role. The only character left is ""Blain"" and the only actors left for him are Oleg Taktarov (as a Russian soldier) and the infamous Danny Trejo (as a Mexican drug lord, not too cliché!); to even suggest these 2 guys were anywhere near the level of ""Blain"" would be blashpemy! And arguably the worst performance of the film belongs to Laurence Fishburne, absolutely mugging it up as an off- his-rocker survivor that the group eventually runs into.The ""twists"" in this movie are rather predictable. The Predator moments are very underwhelming, overscored with ill-timed, overly melodramatic music. Very little of the humor works at times. The first half is OK watching the characters manipulate their way through the jungle, but the second half falls flat with the requisite character bonding and scenes that are direct ripoffs from both ""Predator"" and ""Aliens"" as characters try to matriculate their way through cavernous underground structures to try and escape the creatures and ""get to da chopper""! By the end of the film, it almost felt like it would have been more interesting to have a movie of just the Predators battling each other and the humans could have been left at home!",Predators

111,MrGKB,Predictable bang-bang that adds nothing of note to an already weakened franchise...,5,11 March 2011,"...""Predators"" is ultimately just another example of the weakness of current Hollywood scripting. Written by essential noobs, it's little more than a grafting of the ""Predator"" meme onto the classic Richard Connell short story, ""The Most Dangerous Game."" Had it been done with genuine panache and attention to detail, it might have worked. In ""Predators,"" that's sadly not the case. Director, Nimród Antal, made a nice splash with ""Kontroll"" a number of years ago, enabling him to return to the U.S. in pursuit of a career, which so far seems to be limited to serviceable, though flawed, B-movies, and really, ""Predators"" is little more than a pricey B-movie at heart. What's disheartening is that it's really not a very good B-movie; the script dooms it to the obscurity of mediocrity. No one's going to be referencing this movie in five years (I'm being generous), let alone ten, or twenty or more.The cast is earnest and capable, though at times criminally ill-used. Adrien ""The Pianist"" Brody assumes a remarkably effective macho posture as the resourceful lead, Alice ""I Am Legend"" Braga lends reasonable authority to the tough fem lead, and even Topher ""Spider-Man 3"" Grace doesn't embarrass himself too badly in an otherwise poorly conceived turncoat role. The supports, however, are mostly ciphers, and in the instances of Danny ""Machete"" Trejo and Laurence ""The Matrix"" Fishburne, sadly under-utilized. Production values are good, the lensing by Antal favorite, Gyula ""Kontroll"" Pados, is sumptuously appropriate, and the score by John ""Sin City"" Debney is rousing and makes appropriate nods to the original themes established by Alan Silvestri (as well as the ""Alien"" franchise), but in the end it's still the crippled storytelling that drags the whole thing down into the ranks of forgettable. Too many plot holes, too many ""oh, c'mons,"" and too little taut dialog; it all plays like a first or second draft by a bright teenager instead of a polished, tightly focused script.Oh, well. Watch it if you must; it's not a terrible film, just one that fails to live up to expectations. Of course, after the gutting of the franchise via those two reprehensible tie-ins with the ""Alien"" universe, I suppose I expected far too much. Thankfully, this one was courtesy of my public library, so at least I'm only out my time, and admittedly, ""Predators"" is still better than most all of the ""Resident Evil"" sequels, which I suppose is damning with faint praise.",Predators
112,KnightsofNi11,Lacks in some areas but satisfying nonetheless,6,19 July 2010,"The film opens. Adrien Brody is falling through the sky, not knowing what is going on. The wind wisps around his head as he quickly approaches the dense tree line below him. Just as he is about to hit the trees, a device on his chest beeps and a parachute shoots out, saving him from certain death. It only slows him down a little bit and he still crashes violently through the trees and hits the ground. The main title abruptly flashes onto the screen. PREDATORS. Despite anything else I could say about this movie, that is one hell of a way to begin.Predators is about a group of criminals including mercenaries, serial killers, Yakuza agents, etc that have been dropped onto an eerie and mysterious planet. They have no idea why they are here, and have no idea what ""here"" is. However, after a few run-ins with deadly alien creatures, they realize they are being hunted. They don't know by what, but we do. It is the infamous Predator creature, first making it's grotesque debut in Predator (1987). The film immediately throws us into the action and doesn't let up. It is an entertaining and pleasantly gory ride.After establishing the important characters, we are thrown into the wonderfully hideous landscape of this alien world. In fact, this is probably the films strongest point. The scenery is absolutely beautiful in a dark and disgusting kind of way. There many great vista shots of the world that will wow and amaze. All the art direction of this film is gorgeous. There are many fantastic scenes that exemplify the carefully crafted scenery of Predators. The cinematography is a major high point in the way that it captures the pristine quality of the artistic landscape. The director of the film is a man by the name of Nimród Antal (Control, Armored) and I definitely think his next projects would be worth keeping an eye on.Unfortunately, I can praise Predators for its visual and artistic quality alone. It falls very short on the dialouge and characters. The script is very cheesy and poorly written at points. There are a few scenes that stand out among the rest but most of the dialouge is useless dribble. There are many points in the script where it is obviously a reference to the first film (most of the plot is) and it begs the question, where does one draw the line between homage and rip-off? The characters are nothing to get very invested in either. They all have their significant differences, but none of it really matters as the film progresses to be your typical survival story. I'm a big fan of Adrien Brody and I enjoyed him to an extent in this film. He makes do with what's given to him, which isn't much.Predators greatly lacks in plot or character development, yet being on such an immaculate backdrop, I couldn't help but feel satisfied by the end.

Just passable watching.,5,11 July 2010,"Director Nimrod Antal borrows ideas from John McTiernan 1987 film Predator. The setting is a jungle type planet, with an abundance of vegetation, similar to the amazon rain forest. A group of chosen mercenaries or victims are dropped from mid-air in the planet's atmosphere to land by parachute on the planet. Our group leader begins to seek out other survivors, and they band together. It is only a matter of time before the hunt begins. There is a scene in which the predators use a pack of trained porcupine-like dogs to attack the mercenaries. Other than that there is nothing new here.You feel that John McTiernan, James Cameron, Steven Spielberg or George Lucas would have been better first choice directors for a film of this sort.The background music score is copied from the original Predator film. Casting is TERRIBLE. Don't expect any hulking type heroes like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Carl Weathers or Sonny Landham Or Jesse Ventura.

117,ajs-10,A decent reboot,7,10 July 2010,"Having seen this at the cinema almost a year ago it finally arrived on in the TV schedules. Since I quite enjoyed it first time around I thought I'd give it a second look. Below is pretty much my original review with just a couple of adjustments and a slightly revised score. On second viewing it didn't quite have the impact it did first time around, but it was still entertaining where it needed to be and I finally figured out just what Noland added to the plot.The film opens with a man dressed in battle fatigues falling, he is unconscious, but comes round. Shortly before impact with the jungle covered ground below a parachute opens, but he still lands with a bone-crunching thud. Others land around him and are, at first, aggressive towards each other until the first one persuades them it would be better to band together. They are all from the less desirable side of the tracks, there's a mercenary, a convict, a sniper from Guatemala, a yakuza, a freedom fighter from Chechnya, a kidnapper, a religious fighter and a doctor. It soon becomes apparent that they are not on Earth and that they are being hunted by an unseen enemy. One by one they are eliminated by this foe. Eventually a plan is formed to defeat them and get off this planet.Very reminiscent of the original film, Predator (1987) starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, but maybe without the same impact. All very well done with some excellent special effects and CGI. Decent performances from all involved. Honourable mentions go to, Adrien Brody as Royce, Topher Grace as Edwin, Alice Braga as Isabelle, Walton Goggins as Stans, Oleg Taktarov as Nikolai, a nice cameo from Laurence Fishburne as Noland, Danny Trejo as Cuchillo, Louis Ozawa Changchien as Hanzo and Mahershalalhashbaz Ali as Mombasa.Although not as good as the 1987 original, I quite enjoyed this reboot. Having seen several films featuring the Predators since then, they don't have the fright factor they used to. But it was an entertaining film with some great action sequences and a nice twist at the end. It's not the best film in the world, but over all recommended for those who like this sort of thing (I did). Oh, and it ends wide open for a sequel.My score: 7.1/10",Predators

120,jdkraus,The Predator film I've been waiting for,8,19 July 2010,"Like millions of people worldwide, I am a fan of the ""Predator"" franchise. Like millions more, the Predator was my childhood fear. Hearing that this movie was going to be released, I had to see it but I did not know what to expect. Fortunately, ""Predators"" is a fresh new look that could bring the franchise back to life.The film presents new aspects to the monsters, such as a new world and creatures, yet at the same time, it holds to the original film. For starters, the exact same music that Alan Silvestri composed is used and even though the film's location is another planet, it is a reflection of the jungle that I remember from the original. There are many other similarities that are between the two films, and though some may criticize as being a rip-off, I love it because it adds the disturbing eeriness that was so good about the original film. In regards to plot, I don't need to delve too deeply on. Eight individuals with violent and yet different backgrounds are brought to this new world as the Predators game. I did not recognize most of the actors, but all of them immersed themselves into their roles. I'll note that I found it unusual for Adrien Brody to play an action hero; nevertheless, he delivers a solid performance. Lawrence Fishburne is also a great contributor to the film (though I wish he had more screen time). The technical aspects of the film are brilliant; the visual effects help improve the scariness and ferocity of the Predators, the sound effects are freaky and retain to the original film's creepiness, the editing is crisp, and the cinematography is beautiful. This film pretty much has everything: characters, suspense, thrills, action, a couple of plot twists, and even a cliffhanger for a second film. Though I enjoy this film very much, it still can't top the original. It's definitely better than ""Alien vs. Predator"" and ""Predator 2"", but the original ""Predator"" will always be the winner and a classic in my book. On a final note, like the other Predator films, it is very violent-lots of blood, gore, and goo. This is definitely not for the faint of heart. But if you're like me, this movie might be for you. And you Predator fans out there, this is the film you have been waiting for!",Predators
121,Carycomic,"""We have met the enemy, and he is us.""",10,10 July 2010,"Walt Kelly first coined those immortal words in his classic comic strip, ""Pogo."" At the time (late Sixties/early Seventies), they were meant to be political satire. But, they quite accurately describe the Earthlings in this movie, as well.Initially, there are nine disparate strangers who suddenly find themselves skydiving without an open parachute. One doesn't revive in time, to open his. So, then, there are eight: an ex-CIA mercenary; an Israeli sniper; a Russian Spetznaz commando; a Yakuza gangster; a Mexican Mafia enforcer; a West African resistance fighter; a condemned racist murderer; and a scholarly type who appears to be a battlefield medic. Possibly, with religious pacifist beliefs.Why is he with the other seven? Is he a control subject, meant to keep the others healthy while simultaneously testing their group dynamic (i.e. ""Are they lone wolves, or do they hunt well with others?"")? But, as with the Predatory aliens, nothing is as it seems. The true identity of the scholar came as much of a shock to me as the revelation that there was someone else from Earth still alive on the planet. An African-American Robinson Crusoe, in fact, brilliantly portrayed by Laurence Fishburn. Director Robert Rodriguez has delivered fans, like me, yet another action-packed fable with this sequel. One that breathes new life into a now-classic franchise. For instance; we now know that the Predators are like us in another respect. They will hunt and kill their own kind, if they deem the prey relatively weak enough.A most dangerous game, indeed.",Predators
122,gigan-92,Great Potentional; more Or Less Wasted,6,7 January 2011,"I finally got around to seeing the latest 'Predator' installment and for what it's worth I think it's a much improved production compared to the two God awful AVP films that Paul W.S. Anderson and the Strause brothers have unleashed on us. And I say this for many a reason, first off this is strictly a Predator movie. The director kept the plot focused and uncluttered with stupid story lines, especially stupid plot lines involving xenomorphs. Plus the acting, although limited by the at best decent script, was much better than those two other films. We have actual talent here, not just no name, no-talent actors. Another plus I have to throw in that it was shot pretty well, with captivating terrain and at times satisfying gruesome action sequences.The faults, however, hit hard and bring this film down quite a bit. For one thing, only about three or four of the characters were memorable at all. I mean Adrien Brody does as well as he can with the material he's given, and I enjoy it. The same with Alice Braga, who I liked in the movie quite a bit. And the last truly noteworthy performance must be that of Laurence Fishburne, but his screen time is far too short to fully immerse yourself into. Everyone else is only barely gone into, at most have only a few lines. The Russian soldier (Oleg Taktarov), or the Yakuza (Louis Ozawa Changchien), both were e interesting characters but not enough substance to them. The rest of the cast was easily forgettable once their screen time was up. Plus Topher Grace and a prisoner played by Walton Goggins share some dismal humor that I believe it would've done better without.The other flaw in this movie is by far the biggest. I've heard of paying homage to a movie, especially if your a sequel to that movie that happens to be a classic. But this film over did it. Almost every other line is a quote from ""Predator"", and I don't even think this film has an original score. If it does, it was pretty hard to make out amongst Alan Silvestri's stock scores.Over all,""Predators"" is a worthy edition to check out, and delivers enough plot twists and bloody action to keep you interested, but don't expect a true classic.",Predators

Don't get me wrong: The movie starts off REALLY strong and the first 40minutes of the film is a solid 8/10 but it all falls apart VERY quickly after that. If they kept that same 'energy' that they had in the first 40minutes and kept it going for the full 100minutes then they could easily have had a 7/10 or 8/10 action movie on their hands, and that would have been pretty impressive with just a $40million budget.I really wanted the movie to be better but the final 60minutes of the film are just too terrible. 5/10 and I wouldn't recommend that you watch the film even once, nevermind more than once.",Predators

125,Mr_Sensitive,Didn't Quite Enjoying It,5,20 February 2011,"It only been just two days since I watch this movie and right now I couldn't care more about it; imagine in a week time I think I will completely forgot that I have even seen it. I was actually looking forward for this reboot of the Predator franchise after all that Alien vs. Predators thing. I thought Hollywood already learn what was lack in those franchise and nail it with this one. Damned, I was wrong.Normally I will write synopsis of the movie but this time I won't cause if I do I will be giving away stuff and also there isn't any synopsis to write about cause all I see was group of strangers walking around in the forest being hunted by alien life form. (Well that what happen the the first Predator too, but yet it was so different from this).I didn't really expect anything much from Robert Rodriguez but I was hopeful that he could produce this movie in some way that pay a little respect to the first two Predator movies rather than just mentioning about it a few line inside the movie. For me the story was awful – it was like a combination of Predator 1 and AVP; so what was the point for the reboot. Some of the weapon and the fight tactic are of the same as what we have saw in the original predator, but this time less sophisticated and less suspense.The only good thing (I'm not really even that sure if it was good) was the casting of Alice Braga and Walton, they really suit the role well and I don't really bother by Brody that much like most people do. The casting I'm not really please was the Predator, they not really that big like they use to be so it is not very intimidating anymore. Also the lack of charismatic character to actually hold the movie together really sunk this movie. The score to me is very distracting and loud, sometime it does fit sometime don't.Overall I was hoping to see something really different like what they did with Predator 2 and that one work out brilliantly, but this time all they do was shove it in a lot of Predators and didn't care to elaborate on anything – so it end up to be a pretty weak movie for me.Recommendation: Lucky me I only rented the DVD, if I have actually brought it I would be really mad.Reason to Watch: it used the ""Predators"" name to attract the viewer.Rating: 5/10 (Grade: D)",Predators

The main difference between this film and the one it follows is that it plays on a planet other than Earth, the rest of the story is much of the same.So, it all comes down to the way the story is played out. And it must be said, that isn't all bad. The collection of people is odd enough, the scenery is nice and the effects aren't all that bad. But, it's all too much of the same. For a new audience this probably isn't too bad but for the ones who've been following the series since the very first one it's just not good enough.It beats the second AvP film, but it falls short to all the other films containing one or more predators.5 out of 10 just too weak attempts to revive a franchise.",Predators

OK, the beginning...I always felt that one of the best premises of the Predator saga was that Earth was picked by the aliens as a hunting preserve of sorts, with humans being so violent that we were the perfect ""game"" for them. Well, not in this one. We usually have the Predators falling from the skies, but now we start this one off with the ""game"" literally falling from the sky! Aaaand, on an alien planet at that!!! Unfortunately, the creators completely trashed the original premise that drew so many fans it the other movies, and substituted a much less effective story to take it's place.The movie itself is very low key, relative to the other Predator outings, possessing almost no suspense at all. The characters act more like they are on a camping trip that went sour, rather than express the fear of being hunted on an alien planet. And we spend almost an hour suffering through low level, lame dialog, before we ever ""see"" (pardon the pun) a Predator! Not a good way to win friends and influence fans of the franchise at all.OK OK, so it suddenly picks up speed at the 52 minute mark...but it doesn't maintain that speed. About two minutes of wild action just doesn't wake up the masses guys...No, this one didn't impress me. Look, I like the Predator franchise. I even loved AVP!

Why is Alice Braga made up to resemble Michael Jackson in his Diana Ross-clone period? There's only minimal characterisation as the rest of the cast wait to face their turn in the shredder.A few echoes of LOST: we don't know how they got to this alien jungle.

I am not a huge fan of Predator 2 but absolutely loved the original. When I went to the cinema to see this I went in with very little expectations... but I was very pleasantly surprised.When the film starts it really throws you in the deep end. In the very first scene our main character is unconscious and falling through the air. He wakes up just in time to realise that he is falling and has a parachute on. When he lands he finds himself in the middle of the jungle and has no idea how or why he is there.The story was very vague to start with. All the way through the film I was asking why they were there and who put them there.Because the film is set in the jungle it had a similar feel to it as the original. I always felt that the Predator belongs in the jungle. It suits his personality a whole lot more than taking him to a city. But... this jungle had something that the original film didn't... more Predators.The acting was very questionable in this film. I really struggled to take Adrien Brody seriously. I just struggled to see him as a tough guy. It didn't suit him. I thought they could have found someone better to play this part. Also, why was he trying to do the same voice as Christian Bales Batman? The rest of the cast though were very good. The films starred Adrien Brody, Topher Grace, Alice Braga, Walton Goggins, Oleg Taktarov, Laurence Fishburne and Danny Trejo﻿.The violence and gore was pretty impressive too. It was not over the top but there was enough to keep you entertained. My partner cringed a few times. haha.The main surprise for me was the leader of the Predators. It was a new breed of Predator I had not seen before. His jaw was a lot bigger than the normal Predator. They all looked amazing. There are also other breeds of creature that appear in the film. There is a weird dog like creature that also looks great.Great action, great effects and great suspense. This film is definitely the sequel worth watching.

The director is Nimrod Antal whom I only know from that weird Metallica music movie ""Through the Never"".""Predators"" is a lot like the first original ""Predator"", set in jungle, only this time there are multiple predators. It seems the movie tries to do what ""Aliens"" did to ""Alien"" but doesn't manage to create anything as memorable. To me the film seems too similar to the original. Even though there are multiple monsters, it dosn't bring anything fresh to the table. The characters are ok, there is some interesting mystery about why is each one chosen to be in the situation they are in but this aspect isn't explored much. I would have liked to hear some more backstory of the characters.There is some very cheap looking cgi (the predators' ""dogs"") but mostly the special effects look good. Especially the predator faces are impressive as ever.Compared to the fourth movie this one is a bit more serious in tone and perhaps more faithful to the predator lore established in the first movies. On the other hand I personally might have liked the new movie an inch more because it was something new at least.So...the movie has some value, it has some things done right.

136,TheExpatriate700,Film Hampered by Lack of a Good Protagonist,5,4 December 2011,"Predators is a decent if not particularly engaging follow up to the Predator movies. Rather than retreading the same old plot, Robert Rodriguez switches things up a bit by setting the movie on a Predator game reserve on a distant planet. Although the film has some good action scenes, it suffers from a lack of engaging characters.Although one could argue that a Predator film is just an action piece, we need a good action hero. For example, Arnold Schwarzeneggar made Dutch an easy character to root for in Predator. He was charismatic, sympathetic, and made a plausible opponent for the title alien. Adrian Brody's Royce is a different matter entirely. He comes across as entirely unsympathetic, and even something of a jerk. In the hands of a more charismatic actor, this might have worked, and even fit with the film's survival of the fittest theme. However, Brody is unable to sell this character, making us wish that any other character, whether Alice Braga's Israeli commando, the Yakuza member, or even the creepy rapist, had been made the lead.The film does have some great action sequences to keep the viewer's interest. Highlights include a Predator-samurai sword battle and a climactic Predator battle that is pure fan service. The special effects are also, by and large, great. Still, a better lead would have improved things immensely.",Predators
137,joelwatchesmovies,Surprisingly solid monster-mystery-thriller,7,16 November 2018,"Sure, the self-serious expository dialogue is a little contrived and cheesy at points (lots of ""what's going on?!"") but when the actual plot is written and directed as well as it is, you can let it slide.

It's all out action right from the start, with little character development and very little hope for the characters into which they are put into. One of the main characters played by Topher Grace was completely unnecessary having no redeeming qualities and a rather dumb ending narrative. The film pays a ton of homage to the original Predator, such as the bridge stand-off, the lead females actresses looking very similar and the purposefully placed cheesy one-liners. Don't get it wrong, Predators is a kick-ass film with mindless action sequences that goes by quickly but it provides nothing new to the table.",Predators
139,maxglen,An enjoyable if slightly disjointed sequel,6,7 March 2021,"Predators is an interesting step forward for the Predator franchise, returning to it's roots after Predator 2's focus on the urban jungle; we are given a bunch of well known actors with testosterone up to their eyeballs thrown into a jungle where they are hunted by a seemingly omnipotent force of nature that we of course know is the Predator, except, as the title suggest, there's more! 3 to be exact. I'll start by saying that the characters in this film are pretty hit and miss, Adrian Brody as Royce is fine but I feel he isn't quite believable as the ex-military, black ops mercenary and all round tough guy that the film wants to portray him as. Walton Goggins is a nasty, homophobic, murderer who is a little too familiar with his sister and that can make for both entertaining and somewhat uncomfortable viewing, although, his character is clearly not meant to be liked so I can't criticise him for that. Nikolai and the Yakuza guy are probably my standout members of the group, they are mostly quiet but with very little they manage to make their characters have their own unique personalities that can be recognised through actions as subtle as walking barefoot through the jungle or as bombastic as all out sacrifice. Topher Grace is alright, his character has a sort of reveal near the end and it's a neat twist but has very little bearing on the story and sort of just happens. Mahershala Ali as usual is criminally underused but what else is new? Danny Trejo suffers a similarly early fate and I must say the scene in which he is dispatched is genuinely unnerving, I got chills up my spine, so points for that. Last off we have Isabelle and Lawrence Fishburn's characters respectively; Isabelle is essentially just here to give Royce someone to care about so he can pull off his heroic heel turn towards the end, she also delivers some kind of useless exposition half way through in reference to the original movie so there's that. She's fine. Moving on we have Lawrence Fishburn who is honestly bordering on comical, he overplays the hell out of the character and it's hilarious, but it does grate on me a bit considering how consistent the first act of the movie is compared to when we are introduced to him. I feel the movie starts to lose focus and rushes itself as soon as we are introduced to Fishburn's survivor which is a shame because the build up to that moment is absolutely fantastic. The dialogue is a mixed bag, some lines are so cheesy they're good, some lines are so cheesy they are bad and some lines are actually pretty good as well as everything in between. The music is pretty stellar, mixing some tracks from the original soundtrack with a few new ones which are clearly Alien inspired, or like I'm complaining. The cinematography is quite sharp as well, most shots feel very precise and pleasing to the eye, I never struggled to figure out what was going on which is something films like this constantly do for some reason so I'm grateful for that. Now, let's talk what the film is all about... Predators. They are as creepy and bada** as ever. The new mask designs are so cool it's unreal, the Falconer and Berserker especially are oh so sweet. We actually don't see a predator properly until about 40 minutes into the film or one third to put it into perspective which gives us a lot of time to feel the tension build and feel ourselves as if we were being hunted, I think it was the perfect amount of time to hold off and I'm glad they did as that first portion of the movie is my favourite by a landslide. The action throughout is pretty solid, my favourite scenes being the dog attack towards the beginning of the film and the sword fight in the open field towards the end. Overall I think it's a pretty enjoyable instalment to the franchise, I certainly prefer it to Predator 2 and I won't even mention the malformed mess that was conceived after this. I wish it was a little more consistent across the board but for what it is, I appreciate it. 6/10",Predators

It's these things alone that make Predators so much more than the sum of AVP's parts. Finally, after so many years, fans of the series can finally get the bad taste of those two bastardizations of the franchise out of their mouths. This film is action packed, bloody and gory just like the first movie and I'm especially proud that minimal CGI was used in the film, giving it greater gravitas and real genuine thrills along with great performances from Adrian Brody and especially Laurence Fishbourne, whose superbly maniacal and insane. And for once, this film also has what the AVP movies didn't have: Characters who you care about and who are developed. The story is well-written and thought out. Simple yet easy to follow and understand.In truth I had a blast with this movie. Not only is it a good sci-fi film, it's also one of the best Predator movies ever made; returning it back to it's roots was a stroke of genius. Unlike the AVP movies which strayed so far from the core concepts and brutal mayhem of the first two films, this one goes for the gritty, bloodthirsty attitude that made the first one such a classic.

141,rooee,Jungle boogie,4,8 July 2010,"In snooker they call it a shot to nothing, because the risks are minimal. What did Robert Rodriguez and Nimrod Antal have to worry about when rebooting the Predator franchise? One decent jungle shooter almost a quarter of a century old. John ""Die Hard"" McTiernan's original is fondly remembered, perhaps partially because it came soon after the quintessential '80s Arnie flick, Commando; and, frankly, McTiernan was Max Ophuls to Mark L. Lester's Ed Wood.Predators is basically a rehash of the first film's sweaty bush-sneaking, except with more of the titular monstrosities to feed on the anti-heroes, who've been dropped on an alien planet by virtue of a ludicrous plot device. Paradoxically, it feels more terrestrial than the first movie, perhaps because much of the woodland looks more likely to be populated by the Blair Witch kids than thirty foot snakes and spiders as big as wheelbarrows.Each naughty caricature gets his turn to be scrap appropriately (Yakuza fights with a sword, convict with a shiv, etc), Adrien Brody puts on a Batman voice, Lawrence Fishburne gets a faintly embarrassing cameo, and then it all gets a too busy, ditching the early scenes' welcome tension in favour of listless confusion. Which is a pity, because two thirds of Predators kind of works.",Predators
142,xamtaro,"Who are the real ""monsters who hunt men""?",7,9 July 2010,"After the stunning success in of John McTeirnan's ""Predator""(starring Arnold Schwarzenegger) in 1987, the franchise has spawned a decent range of video games, novels and even a long lasting comics run. Sadly that same success has not been replicated in the movie side of things; one lackluster sequel in 1992 and two crossover ""Alien Vs Predator"" films that many fans consider to be utter disappointments. Twenty three years after Predator's premiere, producer Robert Rodriguez and director Nimrod Antal finally serve up their vision of a true sequel to the classic sci/fi movie.Within moments of the movie's opening, it immediately drops the audience into the thick of it, which in this case involves a the literal ""dropping"" of a mercenary named Royce and eight other people into a strange jungle. Despite being complete strangers, every one of them have a bloody history of violence and killing with occupations that range from Isreli defense force and Black Ops Commando to Yakuza hit-man and Drug Cartel enforcer; the only odd one out being Edwin, a bespectacled wimp of a doctor. Naturally, the motley crew of killers do not get along well; disoriented and distrustful, they turn on each other at first. But just as they put aside their differences and decide to work together, they discover that they are being hunted by a dangerous alien enemy armed with high tech weaponry, near perfect camouflage and inhuman strength. Back on earth these humans were hunters and killers of their own kind, now on this strange new world, the hunter has become the hunted.Smarter than your average sci/fi thriller, ""Predators"" manages to weave in a couple of intriguing themes into the tension filled narrative. Writers Alex Litvak and Michael Finch portray the alien Predators as dark reflections of man's own monstrous nature. Their cruel hunting tactics like making traps to maim instead of kill, and leaving a wounded victim in the open as bait to lure in compassionate comrades, are the exact same strategies that the human characters admittedly used on their quarries back on earth. There is also a subplot about a rivalry between two different clans of alien hunters that mirrors mankind's nature to turn on their fellow man in the pursuit of own interests.The people who worked on this movie have admitted to being big fans of the original Predator and that love for the franchise shows in every single facet of the movie. Fan-favorite scenes are re-created, little bits of familiar lines are slipped into the dialog, even the music by John Debney recreates many of the original themes by Alan Silvestri that any fan of the franchise would recognize. While newcomers to the franchise might not understand ""Predators"" as much as those who are already familiar with at least the first movie, they would no doubt enjoy the solid sci/fi action it presents. Nimrod Antal's camera-work during fight scenes is clear and concise; none of that jittery-cam effect that so many action directors (see: Michael Bay) are addicted to.Overall, ""Predators"" is a like well worn hunter's blade, just like the original classic. Although like any blade, a couple of parts could have used some ""sharpening"". The first act for example manages to maintain a constant state of tension, but viewers expecting wall-to-wall action might end up bored. Events like the civil war between the two tribes of Predators are only implied, leaving the viewer to put the pieces together.Also Laurence Fishburne's deranged Vietnam veteran Nolan, who has survived on the planet for ""ten seasons"" could have used more development.Robert Rodriguez's intention was that 2010's ""Predators"" be to the Predator franchise what James Cameron's ""Aliens"" was to Ridley Scott's ""Alien"". Like the rival tribe of alien Predators, this movie is a bigger, meaner and fiercer affair that successfully fulfills the creative team's intention by expanding the scope of the Predator's fictional universe. Not to mention, a much needed jump start to a waning film franchise.",Predators

145,akshatmahajan,Best Sequel,8,12 September 2020,"Predators is the best sequel in Predator franchise. Honestly saying, I loved it more than the first part.
This movie had everything ie the tension, the focus on group interaction, the music, the mystery.The visuals are good & so is the acting, the writing is exciting.

146,buckikris,Worthy Sequel!,7,13 March 2020,"A small group of strangers find themselves dropped into a tropical jungle. They're all strangers, some are soldiers, criminals, a doctor with a soiled past; and Isabelle from Predator. They are all led by Royce( Adrien Brody) who's a mercenary.At first they have no idea what jungle they have landed in. They all stick together and make Royce the Alpha. They soon realize they are far from Earth, and wonder what they're next move will be. They are on an alien planet, but wonder why? Soon they discover there're not alone and have to fight off two different types of hostile Predator's. One that looks like a Razorback, and the other The classic Predator. In order to survive they must stick together, talk to Isabelle; so they know what they are up against. The most important factor is they must work as a team.
Soon they discover the reason why they were all chosen. Even though they are total strangers, they all have one thing in common. They themselves are predators. This time they are in a foreign land, and they are the prey. The game is on in order to survive you trust no one; and you will live to see another day.This sequel is well above the rating it got. The modification of the Predator was coo;l and adding another foe wasn't something I expected . The cast did a great job and the appearance of Laurence Fishburn was a plus. Predators is a great add to the franchise, but Predator will always be the best.",Predators
147,fciocca,"A pretty average action movie, a big cast doesn't make a good film",5,16 May 2021,"""Predators"" is a huge improvement compared to the second installment released on 1990. It comes back to the origins, by setting the whole plot on the jungle, but this time on a alien planet. However, it does not manage to create the same tension as the 1987 cult classic. This is the third chapter of the saga and we still don't know anything about these Predators and what they want from humanity. The character of Noland was a good opportunity to deepen a little bit the lore. I mean, he spent ten seasons on the planet and he is completely clueless about his enemies. I am very perplexed.Having a cast composed by well known names is not a guarantee. Adam Brody that took parts on very important projects such as ""The Pianist"", ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" and ""Peaky Blinders"", here seems more a guy at one of his first acting jobs. Walton Goggins that acted in ""The Shield"", here was awful, he clearly didn't want to be in this movie. Denny Trejo was very underwhelming. I was extremely disappointed.There are some practical and CGI effects that are done very nicely. I enjoyed Predators costumes, and the planet landscapes are stunning. On the other hand fire and explosions, which are essential elements, are very bad. There is no consistency on VFX at all.This movie starts off great and then, at some point, they did not care anymore, and they just threw random stuff at the audience. A real pity, as this had a lot of potential. Unfortunately they did not manage to create something that it is nearly good as the first ""Predator"". If you are a fan of the franchise, give it a shot, maybe you'll like it.",Predators
148,dvc5159,Now THIS is how you make a sequel!,5,8 July 2010,"It's been thirteen long years since ""Predator 2"" was released in cinemas. And no, screw the AvP crossover films. Although ""Predator 2"" was underrated in my terms, ""Predator"" fans will finally get a long- deserved sequel with the same heart as the first.So, how many sequels have been released from 2005 - now? Lost count? How many of them are reboots/remakes? Well I've compiled a list that showed what a sequel today means to movie audiences today. (""Toy Story"" is excluded, it's a fantastic film on its own.)1. Flashy/Quick-cut editing 2. Shaky camera 3. Overuse of C.G.I. 4. Incoherent Plot 5. Too much/too little characterization 6. Clichéd story/dialog 7. Annoying over-acting 8. Too many love interests""Predators"" avoids most, if not all of these problems to deliver a sheer summer blast of adrenaline, excitement, thrills and gore. It's everything a blockbuster is. You have a solid cast, an iconic creature, and an all-too familiar setting and you have a great sequel in your hands.Film producers think by giving us melodramatic back stories and an indulgence of characterization, we get to know/connect the characters and thus think the movie is better. This works if the movie/sequel has an extremely famous character whose antics have become familiar to us all (e.g. James Bond and Batman). However, we've been seeing too much of it now (""Iron Man 2"") and almost all of the movies today have love interests which are absolutely annoying (""The A-Team""). But Robert Rodriguez gets props for coming up with two things: making it old- school, and making it no-nonsense.The story is kept at a simple level with a very neat sci-fi twist to it, but yet retains much more than just a mere guessing game of ""who-gets- to-be-killed-next"". Yes, there are a few clichés (never ever EVER show pictures of your kids to others - that's a death call right there), but there are still many good things about this film. Firstly, the acting. While not much Adrien Brody pulled of a solid performance as a rebellious and preferably lone soldier with a solid, grunt-like voice and the instincts of a hunter who is ready to abandon anybody, whether he's good or not, for the survival of his own. This trait is usually seen in villains but not in the hero, which makes him a very interesting character played by a very interesting actor. And you can tell he prepared for his role; his abs are proof enough. Alice Braga acts as (NOT) the love interest, but rather, a tough-as-nails female soldier, and she manages to pull her performance off nicely. The rest of the cast also delivers a solid, manly aura around it (with the exception of a wimpy Topher Grace as the comic relief but surprisingly without overdoing it) - including Danny Trejo, Louis Ozawa Changchien and Oleg Taktarov, but Laurence Fishburne shines as the guy who knows everything about the place the soldiers find themselves in, and who's also been on the planet for (a bit) too long.John Debney should be commended for re-using Alan Silvestri's original themes for this movie. It makes the film more like the first. It is rousing, suspenseful, mysterious and filled with danger at times. Debney perfectly scores the movie with ease, using 90% orchestral work, for which I am thankful little to none electronic instruments were used ineffectively, unlike other movies today.The cinematography is great, wide and clear, with NO shaky camera (yes folks, none!) allowing you to see every piece (no pun intended) of the action as it unfurls on the screen. The same can be said for it's production design as the jungle oozes with mysterious qualities, but when the sets come that's when the grittiness takes over. The special effects are good (CGI has one explosion error), however but they don't come up often as the ""Predator"" creature effects and awesome pyrotechnics take over. And there are surprises when it comes to the Predators, especially in the creature designs. As for the weaponry... not so much as it's the same as the first but keep in mind that the film is going back to its roots.Nimrod Antal's solid-as-rock direction brings the film the extra edge sequels have been lacking as of late. He directs the film's gritty, hard-edged and brutal action sequences with a similar flair that he brought onto his previous films ""Kontroll"", ""Vacancy"" and ""Armored"". The action sequences have everything a Predator fan can ask for: blood, gore, guns and explosions, and (most importantly) the theme of survival of the fittest. Antal is a director that has a gift of turning ordinary genre scripts into solid no-nonsense flicks. And certainly one director to look out for more hard-hitting, tough-as-nails flicks. He joins the ranks of John McTiernan and Renny Harlin as really tough action directors, something I thought was lost with the years of superhero movies/sequels that've been shoved down our throats (Michael Bay, take note).In short, I really enjoyed this film more than I had expected, and it really is a nice throwback to the first film. This is summer entertainment with no overkill, delivering exactly what it promises, nothing more, nothing less. See this if you are a fan of ""Predator"". This is a sure-fire blockbuster.Entertainment value: 10/10Overall: 7/10",Predators
149,gary-444,Predator Survives,7,14 July 2010,"The original ""Predator"" with ,Arnold Shwarzenegger, is now 23 years old, its sequel 10 years old. So reinventing the premise of the story had the advantage that a whole load of new sci-fi monster movie fans will be unaware of its existence, and could be sold to afresh, and the disadvantage that its original audience had long since left it behind. This third effort succeeds because the basis of the story is still good, and has been modernised ,with even better special effects. Although formulaic in plot, it does still deliver, and stays just the right side of kitsch.Adrian Brody convincingly takes Arnie's place as a mercenary who finds himself mysteriously parachuted into an unknown jungle with assorted desperadoes . He quickly discovers that the jungle is not friendly in a pleasingly thoughtful , and understated performance. Disconcertingly the open quarter of an hour seems like an out take from ""Lost"", but as soon as the monsters appear we return to familiar action ground.An early mini-dinosaur attack nods to Jurassic park, a derelict spaceship is reminiscent of Aliens, and the showdown with THE Predators is an homage to the original. Innovation is in short supply here, but the genre themes are well explored and well executed. The studiously diverse multi-racial cast is a bit too knowing for my liking with snapshots of lazy racial stereotyping marginally irritating. The first half works better than the second, with the break point being when they discover a human survivor holed up in a wrecked spacecraft. At that point the ""Chase"" finishes, and the story suffers, even though the action ramps up.The cinematography is excellent throughout, and the musical score is traditional, but superb. The idea of an alien planet upon which a technologically superior race predates on humans for fun has more mileage in it which will no doubt be explored in the fourth of the series which must surely come after this.",Predators
150,jcbutthead86,"A Great,Entertaining,Action-Packed SCI-FI-Action Sequel.",10,22 September 2013,"Predators is a great,entertaining SCI-FI-Action sequel that combines great direction,a wonderful cast,thrilling Action,incredible special effects and a fantastic score. While Predators is not as good as the first two Predator films Predators is a fantastic entry in the Predator series.Predators tells the story of a group of soldiers,cops,criminals and one doctor who are led by a Mercenary named Royce(Adrien Brody)who have been brought from planet Earth and put on another planet and are being hunted and stalked by vicious Alien Predators. Now,Royce and the rest of the group have to fight the Predators,stay alive and get off the Planet.Released in 2010,Predators was the second Predator sequel in twenty years(not counting the Alien VS Predator crossovers)since the very,very underrated Predator 2 and despite being produced by Robert Rodriguez I felt when I saw the trailers for Predators that it felt too similar to the first film. But when finally saw Predators I liked it and thought it was a good entry to the Predator series. From beginning to end Predators is an entertaining and thrilling SCI-FI Action film that never slows down and will have you glued to the screen and while the movie doesn't do anything groundbreaking in terms of story Predators is a film that will leave you wanting more. What I like about Predators is the concept of the film where instead of a Predator being sent to earth to hunt humans,humans are being sent to the Predators planet to be hunted and all the humans are all different and come from all walks of life Mercenaries,Soldiers,Cops,Gangsters,Convicts and doctors. Another interesting concept of Predators is that the Human characters are on the Predators planet and where unlike the first two films where characters can escape and get away and escape in Predators there is nowhere to go and no escape and the fact that there is no escape from the planet adds to the movie's suspense and dread of the film where you will feel that none of the main characters are safe no matter what. The atmosphere in Predators is dark and grim throughout and as a viewer you feel like bad things are always going to happen and situations get worse and worse. While Royce and the other main characters in Predators aren't always likable and we don't know too much about them you will feel and truly sympathize with them as they try to survive and live while trying fight off the Predators. I also like that the Predators in this film are a new and different breed of Predators who look different and have their own ways of doing things but follow the same rules as the Predators in the first two films. The Action in Predators is great and thrilling and is also done with great build-up and suspense and when the Action happens it explodes like dynamite and you are on the edge of your seat during the Action scenes. The movie moves at great pace and keeps you glued to the screen thanks to the characters,setting and atmosphere While I like Predators the movie has a couple of flaws and one of them is that Predators is too much like the first film with the setting,dialog and some scenes that resemble the first. And while Predators is a good sequel I think that Predator 2 was a better sequel because while Predator 2 was a sequel it was a sequel that was trying to be different from the first and become it's own movie something that Predators didn't try to be but those flaws don't stop Predators from being the fine Action film that it is. The ending of Predators is fantastic and exciting and is filled with non-stop Action while also leaving the ending open for another sequel. A terrific ending.The cast does great jobs in their roles. Adrien Brody is excellent as Royce,with Brody bringing toughness and intensity to the role. Alice Braga is brilliant and tough as Isabelle,an Army sniper. Topher Grace is great as Edwin,a Doctor. Walton Goggins is fantastic as Stans,a convict and prisoner,with Coggins bringing humor to role. Oleg Taktarov is wonderful as Nikolai a commando with a big gun. Laurence Fishburne is fantastic as Noland,a man who helps the group and knows who the Predators are. Derek Mears(Classic Predator from the first film),Carey L. Jones(Tracker Predator),Brian Steele(Berserker Predator,Falconer Predator)give amazing performances as The Predators. Danny Trejo(Cuchillo),Louis Ozawa Changchien(Hanzo)and Mahershala Ali(Mombasa) give good performances as well.The direction by Nimrod Antal is great and stylish,with Antel bringing wonderful style and pace to the film and doing a fantastic job with the Action scenes. Outstanding job,Antal.The score by John Debney is wonderful and intense,with Debney basically re-using Alan Silvestri's classic score from the first film and applying to this film while Debney also uses his own score to match the film's tone. Fine score,Debney. I also loved the use of the classic Little Richard song Long Tall Sally which is a great nod to the first Predator.The special make-up effects by K.N.B EFX Group is terrific,bloody,gory and memorable as well as realistic and the Predator make-up effects are outstanding and would make the late great Stan Winston(creator of the Predator)proud. Amazing effects,K.N.B.In final word,if you loved the first two Predator films or love Action films,SCI-FI films or genre films in general,I highly suggest you see Predators,a great,entertaining Predator sequel that is well worth your time. Highly Recommended. 9.5/10",Predators
151,Bloodwank,"Nifty little film, falls a tad short but still a doozy",7,2 August 2010,"Had Predators been made a few years back, before the Alien Versus Predator films soiled the property it would have been one of the most anticipated films of its year. But in 2010, with cynical moneymaking executives raiding franchises left, right and centre for ways to cash in, the prospect of another Predator film wasn't as exciting as it might have been. Luckily, this one is powered by a neat script from Robert Rodriguez and astutely directed by Nimrod Antal (Kontroll, Vacancy, Armored). The film starts with a bang, its characters waking up in parachutes mid fall to an unknown jungle, which soon transpires to be a human hunting ground for eager Predator's and their attack dogs. The pace is smart, excitement is built throughout with blips of action and danger mounting bit by bit as the film proceeds. The film is shot on digital, which Antal uses skillfully, there is a real dirty, visceral feel to much of the film and action scenes have great crunching impact. The jungle may not be vibrant like the Schwartznegger original, but it has ample quantities of sweaty, foreign atmosphere. Effects are fine through, cgi is minimal and the various Predator's have a suitably warrior like presence. Acting is all on the ball, Adrian Brody surprises with his convincingly bad-ass hero, tough yet ultimately good hearted female interest is provided adeptly by Alice Braga, even Topher Grace doesn't do too badly in his incongruous doctor role. Oleg Taktarov and Louis Ozawa Changchien also impress as Russian military and Yakuza respectively. They spark well off each other, though the characters are not terribly well fleshed out. Which brings us to the films main problem, none of it is well fleshed out. The film is rife with ideas, there is a pleasing fan-boy aspect to the going on at hand, but nothing is developed. The alien hunting dogs appear once, and not again. Predator technology pops up once or twice but is underused, alien flora gets a small mention but is just a contrivance, its all kinda frustrating. Also, the film is sadly low on gore, the original was hardly a splatter fest but still had a fair few gnarly moments, this film has one or two but is generally not as ballsy. Which is a real shame, since by and large I found this film a lot of fun, but thinking on it afterwards it is a little peppered with flaws. But I still liked it overall, I'm probably quite easy to please. Worth watching in my book then, but no classic.",Predators
152,PeterRoeder,Good movie,6,8 July 2010,"I just saw this tonight in the theatre in my hometown of Lyngby. The cinema was packed, and people seemed to be enjoying themselves. When I came home and saw this on IMDb, I had expected a rating around 7.4. This also summons up what I think about this movie. I'm a fan of the original movie, and it's obvious that this one tries to be loyal to the spirit of the first movie. It sort of achieves that, and we see a lot of interesting and imaginative images. When I went home through the park at night, I half-expected a predator to appear! Some of those monsters in the movie are really scary, and look a bit different than we have seen them before. So whereas this movie is perhaps more loyal than ""Predator 2"" and the ""Alien vs. Predator"" movies, it also lacks a little in being totally great. We don't really feel much for the characters in this movie, and the dialog is a bit tedious at times. Perhaps there's a bit too much dialog. But again, the visuals are great, and it was fairly exciting to try to guess how the movie would end.",Predators
153,Meven_Stoffat,"""Let's find a way off this f***ing planet""",8,6 December 2010,"Like one of the reviewers on the product page, I went into the theater thinking ""OK, let's get this film over and done with"". I remember seeing Predator in my early teens and absolutely loving it, then seeing Predator 2 maybe a year later and thinking it was garbage. And 2 ""Alien Vs. Predator"" piles of crap didn't help either, despite AVP: Requiem being somewhat gory fun. So I cast all worries aside, turned off my brain and just decided to sit back and let the film begin.And I walked out of the theater surprised that they managed to make a film that works not only as a sequel, but a standalone movie! Of course, I wasn't expecting anything Shakespeare or Art House, and therefore I managed to enjoy it well enough.This film finds us with a number of unknowns who wake up after being dropped into a strange jungle. There's something odd about this jungle though- according to the girl in the military, this wasn't like any jungle. Of course it's not long before the discover the horrifying truth- they're on a rock in Outer Space! After doing some discovery, they gind out they are soon being hunted by the Predators. But there's more than just THOSE predators- these people could kill each other off even if there weren't any! Of course, nothing is amazing about the plot and we've seen it 23 years ago. But do give this film a chance; if you need some nice and brainless fun, just go in and enjoy the show. The film is full of action and there is a LOT of gore, and Adrien Brody is a frackin BEAST. There's a lot of funny scenes too, and so therefore, if just entertainment is what you want, be sure to check this out.",Predators
154,Eternality,"Antal has actually won a Cannes award before. Now, that is more shocking than Mr. Pincer Face.",5,10 July 2010,"Initially a film slated for direction by Robert Rodriguez, the maverick director of Sin City (2005) and Planet Terror (2007), Predators is one of a handful of hotly anticipated summer releases of 2010. But due to scheduling conflict, Rodriguez becomes producer and hands directing duties to Nimrod Antal. Born in Hungary, Antal has a short filmography that reads Control (2003) , Vacancy (2007), and Armored (2009). He is the kind of filmmaker whom if given (even) a meager US$40M (that's the budget of Predators) to work on, there is still that looming suspicion that it may be money wasted.Fans will flock to this film like vultures to corpses. I would even predict an easy $250M international gross within a week of its release. This film will make money, but is it the ""Predator"" film that we always wanted to see? Sadly, no. In fact, the best ""Predator"" film has already been shot – the 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle directed by action maestro John McTiernan (Die Hard, 1988). McTiernan's film remains to be one of the best action films of the 80s, and still remarkably holds up as a masterful action-suspense picture.Antal's Predators is as brilliant as Predator 2 (1990). Well, not much brilliance indeed. There will also be debate over whether Predators or Predator 2 is the true sequel to McTiernan's film. Again, nothing of worth to debate on because there is not so much of a single frame in both films that suggest the quality of a ""true sequel"" like that of James Cameron's Aliens (1986). Predators may be a throwback to B-movie sci-fi horror but its execution leaves viewers wanting.Royce (Adrien Brody) leads a group of ""chosen"" people to fight against the Predators on a distant planet. As his character observes in the film, it is all a game of not so elaborate cat-and-mouse, but to entertain whom? Donald Duck? Penned by first-time writers Alex Litvak and Michael Finch whose script is as shallow as the water in their bathtub, Predators has many paper-thin characters who are dispensable to the plot.In fact, their sole purpose (apart from adding to the body count) in the film is limited to the following: To ask ""What the f--- is happening?"" for the umpteenth time when paranoia gets over them, and/or to whine ""Help me! Help me!"" in pathetic fashion when they are about to be impaled by the alien hunters. And if I may add, Brody is somewhat miscast as a gun-wielding ex-soldier. Physically, he looks the part except for his face, which has this perpetual sad and vulnerable look that cannot be concealed even with a macho portrayal.When the appearance of Laurence Fishburne's character, Noland, halfway into film seems to be the highlight of the entire film, it really speaks volumes of Predators' inability to engross or entertain. Antal shows glimpses of his talent for suspense film-making, but like Vacancy, he ends up being subdued by a poor screenplay. Visual effects are borderline decent for a US$40M film, but let's put things in perspective , Neil Blomkamp achieved so much more with only US$30M for District 9 (2009).In a nutshell, Predators is another pretentious and needless effort that tries too hard to please fans. Antal has actually won a Cannes award before. Now, that is more shocking than Mr. Pincer Face.SCORE: 5/10; www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com; All rights reserved!",Predators

156,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,Not as bad as people are saying It is good on his own way,8,8 February 2019,"Predators (2010) is not a bad sequel like reviewers stated on YouTube ranted this movie and put it down. Because imitates the first Predator movie, because Adrian Brody is not believable hero. I disagree with haters so much. Predators is a good movie it is not better than the original Predator but I enjoy it, I like it very much. Doesn't love like I love the first movie but I like it a lot I think it is a good movie and a true sequel to the original. I know everyone has their opinion and some people hate this film. I don't hate I never did. This is a such a good misunderstood action movie.The score in my opinion get's an 8, I gave Predators 8 because there was ton's of action in the film I liked. A lot of people put this movie down a lot of people choose Predator 2 over this film. I have enjoy the film. It is not the ultimate best film ever but still not a bad one I disagree. It is a good action movie but it has it's flaws. This film returns to the original Predator format, and borrows heavily from the first 1987 Predator film. Some scenes were really imitated from the first film but I have really enjoy it and I though it was an okay for an action sci-fi film.The premise is the first thing you see characters falling from the sky falling down in this forest and they don't know each other and what they doing here, how they get there. I like that in the movie. I like this group of people find them self on a different planet in the remote of jungle. They are all different mercenaries from all over the world. They are ruthless killers who are been hunted by three ""predators"" every season. Royce, a mercenary try's to survive on a strapped island with unknown team of mercenaries. I like that the movie is different from the first film it doesn't copy the second one. I love that they use jungles in this movie and I like the design for Predators by Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero. They were faithful to the original Stan Winston design of the original Predator.You have 4 predators in this movie: ""Classic Predator"" (Derek Mears), ""Tracker Predator"" (Carey Jones ), ""Falconer Predator"", and ""Berserker Predator (Brian Steele).Predators stars Adrien Brody, Topher Grace, Alice Braga, Walton Goggins, and Laurence Fishburne and is directed by Nimród Antal who directed well done and Robert Rodriguez produced the film. The 2010 sequel stars Adrien Brody as Royce, a mercenary who finds himself stranded on a strange planet along with seven other human 'predators'.Adrien Brody did a good job playing a mercenary Royce and I thought he was good not better than Arnold Schwarzenegger but really damn good as a hero. Topher Grace is really good from Spider-Man 3 when he heard that Predator 2 was a flop and disappointment he signed to make this movie. I respect Topher Grace so much. The pacing was good and interesting. Alice Braga as Isabelle, a sniper from the Israel Defense Force is a good in her role. This movie is a fun thriller ride and I am going to judge it as a stand up action alone movie. This movie simply ignores the second film and both AVP movies. I have a soft spot for this film.I liked in which the party is attacked by a pack of quadruped alien beasts I like that. I think they actually took that scene from Southern Comfort in which an army was attacked by hunters dogs in this movie the group is attacked by alien beasts looks like dogs. There is a lot of fire power in this movie actor Oleg Taktarov uses Mini gun like in the first film and I have still enjoy it. Laurence Fishburne is in this movie as Noland and I do not like this guy in this movie.I like the music score for this film by Composer - John Debney and it is not different it exactly score that Alan Silvestri did for the first film. Long Tall Sally by Little Richard is also played on the end of credits. I like Predator VS Predator I like that in the movies, so I think it is a damn good action movie. P",Predators

All the claustrophobic and tense atmosphere that made the original a better-than-average genre pic is missing, while a band of enervating idiots mouthing stupid lines is hunted down one by one by a trio of those ugly alien reptiles with severe dental problems.Some nice touches here and there and an overall (though foredoomed) effort to put the franchise back on track save this from being a total disaster, but this ""Lost"" cut-off is nothing more than a B movie without zest.3 out of 10 ugly Predator hounds",Predators
158,rlaine,Great sci-fi action,8,7 October 2012,"I'm a semi-fan of the original Predator-movie. I don't know if that'd be the case if I just saw it, but it was really ""cool"" in the 80s when I grew up. I can't say I was too anxious seeing Predators, but looking at the cast and crew I had a hunch it might be worth the look. Caught it from pay TV the other night and was really pleasantly surprised. I knew nothing of the plot beforehand and that was a good thing. I really did not know what was happening in the beginning, so it really drew me in. The characters were interesting and pretty much everything was spot on, locations were great, acting good, music really nice.It reads in the movie info that the characters are on a different planet, so I'm gonna give it away here (hence the spoiler tag). This is both good and bad thing. It makes nice mystery on how they got there, but the mystery runs somewhat short because it's never really revealed how they got there. I think the script could've been better there. I don't know the Predator franchise well enough to believe that the Predators went to earth, took these guys to their (surprisingly earth-like with even the same plants!) and dropped them down on parachutes. Why were they so specifically chosen? Etc, lot of questions occurred to me that were never explained.I liked the fact that it's not nonstop action. There is a lot of dialog and buildup. Great pacing, which is rare these days. I have to admit I dosed off for a few minutes when the action picked up in the latter half (this actually happens quite often to me with action movies), so I may have missed some crucial dialog explaining some things. Anyway, considering this was an action movie I could actually sit thru 99 % awake is a great accomplishment from the movie makers.I may even come back to this, the atmosphere is so well made. I loved the cinematography, locations and soundtrack. Even the 3D fx shots were done wonderfully. Looking at the end credits, it looks as if Mr. Rodriguez was pretty hands on doing this movie. Antal's direction is smooth and stylish as it was in Vacancy.In the end I would've hoped the script had explained a bit better how they got there etc, but given that this is a simple action movie, I might as well forgive it and give this one a generous 8.",Predators

Adrien Brody (Royce), a cold mercenary,he did a fine job, but he was funny from time to time, damn, he talks so raspy and quiet, like Christian Bale in ""Dark Knight"", like he was on some audition for new ""Sin City"", that funny thing was because I never seen him in such a bad-ass role, but, he was fine. Alice Braga (Isabelle), a tough chick sniper (who has a wet sexy stroke for Brody, of course, she only talks to him!), she was OK. A little feminine cast never hurt nobody. Topher Grace (Edwin), ""a doctor"", he surprised me well here (on the end of the film, you'll see). But, I never saw him as a member of this kind of ""pack"" and this kind of film. He is more a comedian than an action or SF actor, but, this is 2010, you can use everything now. He surprised me good. Walton Gogins (Stans), a FBI most wanted mass murderer, he was great, in all ways, perfect role and perfect actor for it. Oleg Taktarov (Nicolai), a Russian spetsnaz soldier with a mini-gun (my favorite) he was the best in the crew, a normal, quiet tought guy, with a mini-gun!!! Danny Trejo (Cuchillo) a drug cartel from Baja, he was in his element here, pretty good, too bad he didn't have a machete to make reference to Machete (2010). Ozawa Changchien (Hanzo), perhaps besides the Russian, one of the best, a yakuza hit-man... damn, that's awesome. Mahershlhslssllhlshslhslbalablaz Ali (can't pronounce that fokin' name - Mombasa) a RUF soldier who recognizes some of the predators traditional trophy hunt. And Laurence Fishburne (Noland) am Air Calvary soldier who gives us a finest performance in the film! OK, now you're thinking why the hell did he talk about all these character, when he could say ""The characters were good, except few exceptions).Predators, here... are some kind of super predators, a different kind of hunt, no code and some honor. Mostly I hear that these predators were badly done for the film, but I say ""why"", there's nothing wrong with them. They are something new, because we need something new for audience. I think that alien hunting dogs were a touch much. And there's only one classic predator, and it looks great, but that berserker predator looks very ugly. Kidding. OK, move on! Things that I found, not irritating, but somehow, deja vu like... The action takes place in the jungle on other planet. The jungle gives a big reference to the first predator film. I wondered ""why now a different place"", OK, well we haven't seen a predator for a long time in the jungle (that's for the fans), but the wide audience that saw predator films as a form of entertainment... they don't give a damn. There are a lot of old predator references for fans and for 80s audience, OK, I was one of the 80s audience, well I still am! :)) That's what I found really negative about the film, give us something original, please! No need to go all over and over again with ""You are one ugly mother..."" Other things were solid, no complaints there.Anyhow, this is one good, B movie from Robert Rodriguez that will give you a good time and fine entertainment. Watch it!",Predators
160,Gresh854,A Different Take,6,8 September 2018,"Once again, not bad at all. I dug the sheer hell out of the concept for Predators. (Minor Spoilers) The Predators kidnap a group of humans each encompassing a distinct survival trait in order to use them as arena bate for their little manslaughter games. Now that's just downright imposing. The Predators have never looked so astonishing and pragmatic; it's genuinely awe-inspiring especially for the many sci-fi geeks and geekets out there. The set-pieces and costume designs are exceedingly profound and I grant the engineers my full, attentive praise.That being said, I really wish that the direction and dialogue was substantially better. The director decides to whirl with a more modern and jarring approach to filming his action sequences, which, quite frankly, took me out of the movie from time to time. Sometimes the cinematography is relatively beautiful, but unfortunately, the color graining is rather dry and oversaturated (like a Transformers movie). There are some really shortsighted/ ludicrous events that occurred in the finale that-just by a string of hair-nearly ruined the entire movie affair for me. Gracefully, these rubbish story decisions (writers...) didn't wear off the film's engaging pace.Let's just say the concept saved this movie. If we didn't have this factor, we'd virtually be left with a Predator remake that just has more predators in it. It's a damn shame that this movie could've been miles better considering the potential premise it had, but that being said, I still found merit within it during my viewing. It's nothing extraordinary nor revolutionary, but I still was rewarded with that homicidal, savage, blood-shedding nuttiness I crave out of these coarse, boorish Predator movies. So...wooh-hoo?

I don't know whether it was released straight-to-DVD, but it would rank at the higher end of that category.What I found interesting about this movie is how it packed in every cliché I could think of. Adrien Brody talks in a husky voice (not quite a Stalone) and has his bear-chested scene latter in the movie. Someone gets shots and falls don behind a large log and by the time the attacker slowly walk over - he is gone. Someone says something like 'we are safe now' followed by them being shot and, they look slowly down in surprise before falling over.In fact, for me it became game of spot the cliché which made this movie watchable.Othwerise it's not bad - it is just formula movie making.",Predators

First this man Royce, boring. Then more men, boring. Then a woman, boring, you already know that Royce and this woman will remain last, boring. The movie is taking too long just to introduce us all different characters. As a viewer I have no interest in knowing people of which I know they all get slaughtered one by one.This new planet looks a lot like earth! How on earth is that possible? This ""doc"" knows a lot about the fauna on this planet. How? These predators leave their footprints on the ground. How? In predator one they move through the trees.There is this man who has been on this planet for ten seasons. And then he just gets killed just like that. These people know that if they put clay on their face/body, they'll be invisible for the predators. Why don't they do that? Three predators aren't frightening. Three hundred neither. Kill all, it's the last one who is the most powerful, yeah right. In the first predator movie Billy is staying back trying to kill a predator with a big knife, in this one a man is staying back to kill a predator with a sword.I didn't like this movie. There was not much new. The movie, story wasn't exciting. A group of men and one woman are being dumped on the planet. Why this woman? As a predator I would be offended to have a woman for prey.

165,RichardSRussell-1,"Not a TPK, But I Was Kinda Hoping It Would Be",4,15 July 2010,"Predators (1:47, R) — Science Fiction; 3rd string; sequelRemember back in 1979, when Ridley Scott scared the bejeebers out of everybody with Alien? Then, 7 years later, James Cameron came along and introduced us to the most terrifying letter in the English language by tacking an ""s"" onto the end of that title, implying that there were MORE THAN 1 of them?Producers Robert Rodriguez, Elizabeth Avellan, and John Davis evidently thot they could pull off the same trick here. There are several problems with the idea, tho.1st off, their armillary manikin, the 1987 film Predator (starring Arnold Schwarzenegger) wasn't as strong a foundation to build on. (I gave Alien an 8 — in retrospect too low — and Aliens a 9, but Predator only a 7.)2nd, it's not as if anticipation has been building. We've had 3 intervening movies in the Predator series, and they've mainly been dogs:  Predator 2 in 1990 (5)  Alien vs. Predator in 2004 (4)  Alien vs. Predator: Requiem in 2007 (3)3rd, Rodriguez's Troublemaker Studio is renowned for getting a lot of mileage out of low investment, but there are limits. Everything about this movie shrieks ""cheap!"". The entire thing is set in a totally generic jungle, the ludicrously planet-packed skyscape is painfully obviously a static matte painting, and the barely seen alien spacecraft are only a couple of notches above Flash Gordon quality. Yes, I know that Adrien Brody won a Best Actor Oscar, but the only other performer you've likely heard of is Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus from the Matrix series), and he only glimmers thru in a 5-minute cameo role.There are plot holes hither and yon. For instance, early in the movie Brody's character remarks that the sun hasn't moved in the sky. Yet later it's night. If anyone notices this discrepancy, they don't burden their comrades with undue speculation about it. (Screenplay by Alex Litvak and Michael French, to give credit where it's due.)So, on to the plot. Stop me if you've heard this before. 7 heavily armed, deadly killers and a doctor walk into a jungle I contend that, for something as formulaic as this, it is not a spoiler to reveal that almost all of them die grisly deaths, 1 by 1. The only suspense is the sequence. Let me save you 10 bucks:(1) Cuchillo of the Tijuana drug mob (Rodriguez fave Danny Trejo)(2) Mombasa, the Sierra Leonean freedom fighter (Mahershalalhasbaz Ali; still miss ya from The 4400, big guy)(3) Nikolai, the Speznats gunner with Chechnya cred and itchy trigger finger (Oleg Taktarov)(4) Stans, orange jumpsuited because he was scheduled to be executed in 2 days (Walton Goggins, formerly of The Shield, who gets off the best line of character development in the entire movie when he asserts ""If we ever make it home, I'm gonna do me so much f**king cocaine!"" — in short, no character development whatsoever)(5) Noland (Fishburne), who has survived on the planet for 7 hunting seasons. Or maybe 10. He's not quite sure. Nor is the invisible guy he keeps talking to. But he's honed paranoia to a fine art form.(6) Hanzo the yakuza (Louis Ozawa Changchien)(7) Edwin the doctor (Topher Grace), who seems like the clean-cut, fresh-faced misfit among this overwhelming load of misfitsWhich leaves us at the end, to nobody's great surprise, with the stars: Royce (Brody) and Isabel (Alice Braga), both of whom evidently have black-ops backgrounds, except that Isabel still works for her government (to which she feels some minimal allegiance) while Royce is entirely a gun for hire looking out for #1.I list the characters' names here because they're available on line, but only the last 2 are ever spoken aloud during the movie, and then only at the very end. The characters are all cardboard cutouts, the sum of their stereotypical characteristics and no more.The IMBb listing also indicates that there are several types of predator involved as well — classic, berserker, falconer, tracker, black super, and falconer super — but you'd never know THAT from the movie, either. We do learn that the predators have factions, and some of them battle each other, but there's no way to tell them apart when the action gets started (a failing shared with the Transformers movies).The movie is filled with a lot of action sequences, the protagonists (whom I refuse to call heroes) are required to live by their wits more than simply massive firepower, and there's a reasonably ingenious and unforeseen escape sequence at the end, so it doesn't fall all the way into my ""stay away"" range of 1-3 ratings. But it doesn't miss by much. While it's not a TPK, I found myself kind of hoping it would be.",Predators
166,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: Potential Wasted!!,6,12 March 2014,"Predators. Using the idea of cult Predator movie of warriors (here all strangers) fighting technically advanced aliens in a terrifying jungle, Predators take you directly into the middle of action and there is a mystery as well; where are we, what is this place? First half does good exploiting the mystery factor and attitude problem between key characters but when everything is out in open, movie starts dragging itself with writer running out of ideas to keep you engaged. Adrien Brody and Alice Braga do good in their love-hate relationship. Aliens are being done technically better but the mystery around them remains a mystery. There are few silly twists thrown in second half which are over before you start thinking about them. I am going with 6 out of 10 for Predators.

The title is, in my opinion, a mistake for it leaves the film with so much to live up to and nowhere to go.The plot, a group of people parachuted into a jungle somewhere but with a small memory loss of why they were dropped, is hugely promising and the movie has some very sharp dialogue, but only in places. Elsewhere it has all been done before and so many times it has been done better. The acting is, as everything in this movie, patchy. I got the feeling a few were just there for the money.Does the film grip? Does it entertain? Does it have a good story to tell? Was it worth the bother? If it makes money for the participants then the answer to the last question is all that really matters.Five out of ten because I would have given it that without the hype.",Predators
168,colinrgeorge,Perception Vs. Predator,8,15 July 2010,"I was always an ""Alien"" guy. Wretched from the opium dreams of Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger, that phallic chest-burster is the most imaginative space creature ever devised. It's a Superman/Batman debate, but by comparison, the ""Predator,"" who was introduced to moviegoers almost ten years later—Didn't seem to bring anything interesting to the table. Like Batman, he had gadgets to spare—But where's the creativity in that? He was a villain that better reflected a decade of machismo action than the seventies' horror boom that begot Ridley Scott's film—Look no further than the casting of his foil, eighties icon Arnold Schwarzenegger.So ""Predator"" and I parted ways. And though the two franchises would go on to literally duke it out in the miserable ""Alien vs. Predator"" films, the argument still seemed to me pitifully one-sided. But then, three days ago, something clicked. ""Predators,"" a pseudo-sequel to the original, finally won me over.I'm as surprised as anyone; in an attempt to emulate a film I disliked, director Nimród Antal made one I did. However, his intention was not, as others have hastily criticized, to parrot what worked in 1987 verbatim. In fact, the influence of ""Alien"" on his film is just as apparent as that of its namesake (it even borrows the other series' pluralized sequel title gimmick), and the audience gets the best of both worlds. Run and gun action is superseded by atmosphere and suspense, but Antal knows he's not making straight horror either.The filmmaker instead rides the line equidistant. He rightly plays the predators threatening rather than overtly scary, invisibly calculating rather than brutally aggressing. Their looming absence runs the risk of upsetting some more literal-minded fans, but as someone who was never sold on the character in the first place, the less predator in a ""Predator"" film, the better. Plus, the deliberate pacing offers some interesting, offbeat payoffs that I frankly wouldn't have expected from a movie like this—Anyone questioning ""Predators'"" originality needs to point me in the direction of the other human on alien sword fight they've seen.But as much as I love unprecedented choices like that, I can't pretend there aren't also minor problems in this jungle. It's more of a warning than a complaint, but you need to be willing to accept some character clichés going into ""Predators."" Elsewhere, it may distinguish itself as a cut above its contemporaries, but the humans in the film snugly fit archetypes exploited a dozen times over. Their big personas and propensity for campy dialogue is soothed by the talent at hand (Adrien Brody—Whose range continues to amaze me, Topher Grace, Danny Trejo, Lawrence Fishburne), but a couple clunkers still shine through—You'll know the misplaced rape joke when you hear it.But really that, along with one or two inelegant plot developments, is a small trade-off for all ""Predators"" does right. On the whole, genre films have become submissive entertainment, content to passively shovel innutritious junk food into our eye sockets, with no regard for what should make what we're seeing scary or exciting. ""Predators"" takes its time and explains itself—It creates a beautiful, believable world—While still wearing a permeating cologne of mystery.Maybe this review ultimately says less about ""Predators"" and more about the industry at large given that I find practical locations, largely practical creature design, and a script that takes a few risks so praiseworthy, but there it is. For once it's nice to just see a straightforward sequel done well, and the film has so much authentic adoration for its many sources of inspiration that it almost feels as though it has existed since 1990, when the actual ""Predator 2"" debuted. Had this been released in its place, I'm confident the film would be remembered as fondly as ""Aliens"" is now.But sadly, in the realm of public opinion, many consider digging up old graves an automatic disqualification. For me, there's nothing sacred about the original ""Predator"" film; this one improves upon it. Of course, it's made by someone whose sensibilities are closer to my own, but Antal makes no apologies for that.Maybe I was always an ""Alien"" guy, but I may have room in my heart for another hideous space monster after all.",Predators

172,honorhorror,Culture Shock Series: Predators,9,18 July 2010,"Well, why doe ""Predators"" belong to ""Culture Shock"" series in my review? That's because humans in this movie are totally strangers from different cultures, and they are being hunted by an alien civilization on another freaking planet. How much culture shock do they have to suffer? That being said, Predators is a somewhat surprisingly good movie to recommend this year. It's a proof that with enough heart and effort, you can make something shine even the backdrop is run-of-the-mill.Preventing spoilers, only my favorite scenes will be listed here: 1, the final duel and trap-setting; 2, ""Life and death of space Morpheus""; 3, ""revelation of the nice pacifist guy""; 4, ""Master Predator VS. Junior Predator on probation""; 5, ""Welcoming treat with a touch of Major Dutch"". They are not super-expensive, there's no massive CGI involved, but they are all very effective in making the story more and more interesting. There are moments that are genuinely for fans, if you happen to have wondered how exactly Billy's knife fight worked out in the original predator. There are also genuinely written plot developments for intelligent viewers, if you watched closely enough on the nice pacifist along the way. Frankly speaking, I was always assuming the movie will take the run-of-the-mill road like the previous AVP movies, and that's where the makers worked hard and made me satisfied. They are aware of the clichés and they're not afraid of joking with you. That's good.OK, let's go back to the Culture Shock theme the movie possesses. Imagine there's actually a race from the deep space that cared to make an encounter with you, what overlapping point in the cultures would you find to communicate? And yes, the answer provided in the entire Predator series is Violence/Killing. Same thing applies to the earth. Humans from different cultures have been exchanging bullets, grenades, bombs, warheads for centuries after they found exchanging cold arms a bit, eh, inefficient. Oriental gentlemen used to say, ""Exchanging words of politeness before you exchange warfare."" Sadly, we usually can't learn enough about each other before we had warfare. Over the years, the Predators adopted Major Dutch (Arnold)'s booty trap strategy and was honest enough to admit they are ruthless/shameless enough to apply all kinds of predating tactics on their human opponents. They learn fast and the odds are not good for us. It appeared they have unlimited potential to best their prey, humans are beyond redemption in front of them. However, you can't make something slapstick without praising it enough. Despite what the audiences felt about them, Predators are still only dolls under writer's pen. And, that's how the master predator defeated his own logics when he fell into the pianist's trap. It's also an ironic proof that humans can't imagine anything even nastier than themselves. See, humans cheat, lie, betray, devalue themselves in this movie while the junior predator on probation (we have no idea what he did to deserve being tied up, maybe he's not qualified in the final exam and was on probation) was somewhat faithful to hold his promise to the pianist even though he knew he's no match for the master predator (who's maybe his headmaster). That being said, I'd say the predators are pretty...straight, honest, abiding and somehow lovable, unlike the ever-sly and evil human killers. And that's why, as you've noticed, that I kept using ""him"" for predators, not ""it"".If the original Predator is about humans vs. natural cruelty vs. alien brutality, Predators the movie is about the same but you can replace ""humans"" with ""humanity crisis"". As the story goes on, the topic ""how can you hold your humanity and dignity"" was brought to discussion several times. It ended with different conclusions, but the final answer cemented by the survival of leading male and female is quite interesting: ""human's surviving instincts and humanity are like two sides of one coin, when they are covering each other, humans can live on."" I haven't fight with any Predators, but definitely would give this philosophy a try if someday they come to me, which I believe, will not happen.The other interesting question is about whether predators can be called ""space people"" or only ""space animal"". One great man who believed in Jesus once said even there are space people; they may not be as brutal and evil like us. The previous Predator movies, if followed the formula of making Predators totally inhuman, all provided some scare, while the first AVP movie (directed by Paul W.S. Anderson) broke this rule and had the predator forming a friendship with human heroine. That turned a lot fans off, but again reminded me that humans can't really imagine anything nastier than humans. See, if they are only animals, they'd only be hunting for their existence, killing for food or reproduction, and you just need to kill them like killing animals. But Predators also have some Samurai dogmas, cannibal customs of wearing human trophies and restless desire to learn killing. Sadly, combining such features with animal instincts still can't produce something we never have in the history. They are, utmost, on par with the worst human killers (not to mention the real human killers are actually nastier than them).Royce and Isabelle watched the new chosen killers being parachuted into the jungle, and turned away from them, they didn't say they won't trust these freshmen to the game, but they believed more in finding a way out of that planet by themselves. Do we have anything to believe, to behold in our daily humanity crisis? Honestly, I am not waiting for the cuddly E.T. to help subliming human nature, because some 2000 years ago the one who created us already opened his door and call out to us, ""come home"". How much longer will this door be opening, that I don't know, but I only have this life-time to make the choice.",Predators
173,nims-1975,Better than I expected but still not intense or powerful enough,7,6 February 2021,"Predators is an in between good and very good film. It couldn't come close to the original or the sequel Predator 2 starring Kevin Peter Hall, but is definitely much more better than the completely crap Predator remake. The characters were great though and so were their roles and Adrien Brody portrayed himself as being a very tough and powerful soldier. All the other characters especially Laurence Fishburne were interesting but the film should have focused more on them. The action was done very well but it mixed with other parts of the film was just not intense or powerful enough compared to the action in Predator and Predator 2 which was extremely intense and powerful. So the problem was the film wasn't intensifying. One of the best parts of the film was the Battle between Adrien Brody's character Royce and The Predator. That combat scene was awesome, it also was an extremely tough and difficult fight he was in and he struggled to kill The Predator and he finally slauughtered the Predator in what was a long fight. That scene was extremely intense but the rest of the film did lack the intensity and power. This wasn't a classic, but it was a watchable film that I enjoyed watching.",Predators
174,Fields201,I Should Have Avoided This,4,10 July 2010,"I wasn't going to see Predators. A friend asked if I wanted to go and another friend overheard us and it was like going out with some buddies to see a movie. I was stoked and paid for my ticket. It turned out I didn't see any of them and sat to watch this thing by myself.The movie starts out briefly introducing the main characters and just goes right into the action. You don't know much about these characters as they are pointing their guns throughout the jungle. Then just some random things happen. They come across traps and they all live because, well, they are meant to be Predator fodder.Adrianne Brody's character spoke with this ruff voice and for some reason he just knows everything that is going on. ""What's going on here?"" asked one of the crew. And Mr. Exposition would say, ""It was meant to maim us. They attack in packs, surrounding us--"" And then some big explanation like there's a handbook on this or something and I'm just left wondering, How does he know? Then we get to the Predators themselves and, in my opinion, they look worse than the Predator in the original. Not only that, I never really got the sense that they were all that tough. In fact, the final duel with this mean Predator, well, he was just getting his butt kicked. There's also a scene where one of the characters gets into a sword fight with one of the Predators. There was this fleeting moment in the end where the audience cheered... and then the movie screws it up.Finally, we get to the ending. I'm not going to spoil it but let's just say it felt like a total cop-out. It was like the filmmakers couldn't find an ending so they just threw something together. The film was terrible enough but if it had a good ending, at least it would be salvageable.There are some moments in the film that I liked. There was this creepy scene where one of the guys was on his knees, facing away from our heroes, and timidly calling for help. They couldn't get to him because Mr. Exposition knew it was a trap. It was a genuinely creepy scene and I felt it stood out more than any other death in the film.And it had Laurence Fishburne in it but his character is pretty much wasted.All and all, though Predators wasn't the worst movie I've seen, but I definitely rate it as the worse I've seen this summer.

Predators as a Hollywood blockbuster fulfils it's primary function to entertain it's audience for enjoyment, but it could have been better.The basic story we know where a group of humans mostly with military backgrounds but including an ex-con and medic are kidnapped and dropped out of the sky on an alien planet to be prey for the ""predators"" They join together to try and find a way off the planet and get back to Earth. The positives of this movie, with it's biggest strength is the action. It is choreographed well and manages to be both exciting for it's audience and have enough suspense and tension at the same time. One of the surprising facts about this movie is that it was made on a small budget, but the special effects look far from cheap. It's a testament to director Robert Rodriguez that they look impressive. I also like the soundtrack music throughout and Lawrence Fishburne's performance as the character Noland was terrific. He plays an ex-marine who has been on the planet for so long, he has become mentally unstable as he keeps talking to himself. Unfortunately it was only a small cameo as he is in it less than ten minutes.In terms of the other actors like Adrien Brody, Topher Grace, Alice Braga, Walton Goggins and Oleg Taktarov who play parts of the group dumped. Fishburne's performance was more entertaining to watch than all their's put together in the whole hour and forty five minutes. Their acting was awful. Like many Hollywood blockbusters like this, it suffers from lack of acting ability from the main leads, no character development and in the end I just didn't care about them and wouldn't have been bothered if they had all died. It wasn't entirely the casts fault as they are unsupported by a terrible script, which is very cheesy indeed. The story itself is quite thin with no substance. The film also lacks much intelligence though the group are careful not to walk into traps and conserve their ammunition. Near the end climax the medic suddenly changes sides for no reason at all that is credible to his character except for a supposed ""shock twist"" which is completely ridiculous and implausible. Hollywood must sometimes think audiences are that gullible. The medic claims to the predators ""he's one of them"". I like to know how he worked that out. But it needn't have mattered, he gets exterminated anyway.Another silly change of heart is from a predator who helps out Brody's character Royce. He threatens the predator that if he dosen't help him find his ship, he will kill it, but all his carrying is a knife. The predator could have just tricked him and killed him, but no it fights another predator to help him escape. The action just like the medic makes no sense as it isn't explained! Overall Predators is an entertaining movie but lack of intelligence near the end, thin story, no character development, terrible script and bad acting stopped it being better than it could have been. It's only worth renting on DVD really not see at the pictures.",Predators

178,budmassey,And open offer to Hollywood.,3,11 July 2010,"It must be that I watch too many movies. Maybe I expect too much. I know it's not realistic to expect a big-budget, effects-laden alien attack movie to be too heavy on plot. But I don't believe that we should be expected to swallow a sort of deus ex machina setup with no explanation or exposition.I can just see the script: ""and then the main characters, selected from around the world for being really bad people, drop inexplicably from the sky onto a planet untold light years away with parachutes and weapons just inadequate enough that they can be hunted."" Really? This is your story? Oh, but, dear reader, there is more.For some reason, the main characters seem to know things they could not possibly have observed, and explain them to one another in astonishing detail so we can at least attempt to fill in enough plot holes to suspend our disbelief long enough to take this anemic story for a spin. And spin it does, from bad to worse.First, let's deal with the obvious issues. There are the warthog dogs the size of a Subaru with so many horns and fangs that eating any prey they manage to run down would be a physical impossibility. There's the celestial problems of a planet that supposedly always faces the sun, probably not conducive to the ecosystem presented, and which is in direct conflict with the fact that later in the movie it gets dark, not to mention the fact that it has neighbors large enough to rend it in an apocalypse of gravitational fury.But it is in the subtleties, or lack thereof, that this movie fails, and it fails utterly. You might remember that the original Predator movie actually had a working back story, complete with reasonably well defined characters struggling with internal and external conflicts. You might also remember that the alien attack aspect was layered with subtle suspense upon the storyline in the original. Here, it is the film's sole raison d'être, and it's tedious, not suspenseful.Having forsaken everything that might have made this muddle a movie, its creators rely instead upon tawdry tricks. There are mawkishly re-imagined scenes from the original movie. And of course there's the trick casting. Adrien Brody does a creditable job as a bad man, but the grunting brute routine is a little wearisome, especially when contrasted with his out of the blue, half-assed Hemingway quotation. And if you're wondering why Topher Grace is in the movie, don't ignore the obvious. Besides, is it just my overactive ""spider sense,"" or wasn't he already counter-cast in a big budget action sequel? But the one towering issue I have with this mess is the same issue I have with all the previous sequels. It's the Predators themselves. Are we to believe that an alien race capable of interstellar flight and teleportation really have nothing more on their inscrutable insect minds than some endless demented hunting and taxidermy game? Are they some hopelessly retrograde culture? What other technological marvels have they devised? What happened to their civilization? Do they not have females in their species? What is their life cycle? Inquiring minds want to know.Basically, this plays like an FPS video game, and not a partiularly good one. We expect more in a movie than running around shooting. So, I have an open offer to Hollywood. I am certain I can write a better script with these amazing creatures as characters. I don't have an agent. Contact me directly.",Predators

They eventually run into each other, distrustful at first, but soon realize they need to work together if they are to have the best chance for survival against the alien predators responsible for their predicament.Now let me briefly explain my star ratings as if you give 2 cents: Anything 5 stars and above is worth going to see; even spending your own money without waiting for an invite (!Freeloader Alert!). Anything below 5 stars you should let come to you (an invite, t.v, etc.) ---And if it doesn't? Who cares.I prefer the first Predator movie.In part because it was original (the first time we saw that type of situation with an alien, and that particular alien). Sequels, unless they can add some originality of their own (and a few have) tend to suffer for this reason in comparison to the original or first movie. So there are no big surprises in this one except for Adrien Brody who, in my opinion, can now be taken seriously as a serious action star along with the best of them (Who knew?).Notwithstanding what I said above, Predators is a good, standard, action sci-fi adventure movie; worth going out to see and testing your stomachs capacity for storing snacks.

181,priyantha-bandara,Almost all the early predator fans will like this movie. If your one of them go check it out,7,24 October 2010,"Being a huge fan of the 1987 original Predator I have never missed a single installment which came later on with the brutal 'casting' of the mean & Huge Mr. Predator! Equipped with high tech gadgets and technology that can identify pray in pitch darkness and hearing even their heartbeat from a distance, predators are one of kind hunters from an alien planet. The new movie 'Predators' (2010) has a slightly different plot than from the original but the rest of it remains mostly the same. A group of highly skilled individuals get hunt down by an alien hunter (Predator) and this time there are more than one which make it 'Predators'. And for a change it happens on a planet other than earth. Well there is a little twist their but from the whole stories perspective even it really happened on earth there won't be any critical difference after all. And we have lost the muscular key character (Arnold is busy getting old and running for the next potential president of US) and he's replaced by somewhat skinny Adrian Broody. But he does the best for the character by not letting down his guard and ultimately becoming one of the two people who still stands after all the drama. Acting is overall good. And so do the cinematography. The action sequences are good teamed up with the stunning new score (Old one is one of my most favored scored of all time).I think almost all the early predator fans will like this movie. If your one of them go check it out.",Predators
182,Jonathon_Natsis,B-list film with an A-list budget.,3,1 February 2011,"I couldn't imagine a more appropriate one-sentence summary for this film. A B-movie in almost every respect (excessive gore, multiple plot holes and lazy, disjointed characterisation), Predators is underwhelming in its effort to re-ignite the franchise, operating as a threequel more so than a total reboot. Despite being directed by Nimrod Antal, this is certainly one of Robert Rodriguez's babies, as both the scriptwriter and producer. The film follows an elite group of professional human killers, and one doctor, as they come to realise they've been dispatched onto a remote planet which acts as a hunting preserve for the Predator race. Their task is to not only survive (a feat in itself), but to find a way off the planet, ensuring a follow-up film in the future.Let's get to the positives first. The action is, for the most part, enjoyable and well directed, allowing the viewer a great visual scope of what is going on in each scene. Also, all films of the Predator saga are referenced in some way, providing some fun for big-time fans. And there is, of course, the mandatory reference to a certain Tarantino film (you'll know it when you see it) which certainly put a smile on my face.By a long way, the most disappointing aspect of Predators was the atrocious screenplay. A well-structured script brimming with originality can bring the characters to life like no other filmmaking tool. A weak one offers no scope for the characters to appeal to the audience, because they feel like carbon copies of the generic models seen countless times in this genre. I like to view Rodriguez as an auteur rather than just a filmmaker. As such, I expect that he would inject some of his own ideas, characters and scenarios seeing as he is a specialist of the self-reflexive B-movie genre. Instead, one gets the impression that he just sat back and let the film cruise along at a stressless pace, not at all interested in having its events stick in your mind after the closing credits. As odd as it sounds, I actually drew major comparisons between Predators and Jennifer's Body during the screening. Both films were presented as something they clearly weren't, and both films featured personalities who, at their peak, are capable of contributing handsomely to quality films (Rodriguez with Sin City, and Diablo Cody with Juno). Unfortunately, when either writer operates outside their comfort zone, the screenplay becomes either lifeless or overly ambitious.Just as confusing was the implementation of what has become known as the 'Jaws complex': the idea that, the longer a film's antagonist is kept out of audience view, the more sinister and threatening their ultimate appearance becomes. But the fact that the viewer already knows what the Predators are capable of/look like through earlier films completely negates this idea, and eliminates any suspense that may have developed as well. A minor gripe to finish on. There is a cat-and-mouse scene about midway through the movie which requires the characters to see where they are going, with the use of flares and flashlights. The problem is that, with every opportunity they get, the actors will flash them right down the lens of the main camera. Because of the intense contrast between light and darkness, this results in discomfort to one's eyes, and detracts from the overall cinematic experience. Here's hoping Rodriguez can bounce back with Machete, his highly anticipated QT collaboration.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

183,vip-danii,I Wasn't Disappointed...,10,29 March 2013,"I'm a fan of the ""Predator"" franchise, and have been looking forward to this movie. Well, it didn't disappoint.But... oh dear, why did Brody have to talk in that ANNOYING half-whispering voice throughout the whole film? That alone, for some people, was enough to kill the movie's appeal. I cringed when I saw ""The Dark Knight"" and heard Batman's voice, but it was KIND OF understandable, since Batman was Bruce Wayne in disguise, so he had to do something with his voice in order to avoid being recognized, but what the hell would Royce talk like that for?? It was seriously embarrassing and cringe-worthy...I think Brody was slightly miscast, actually. Not terribly miscast, but... he's no Arnie. He over-acts and tries too hard to come across as cool, which just renders him unconvincing at times.Plus, it's 2013 for Pete's sake, so there's no need for these stupid stereotypes -- why does the Russian guy have to appear dumb, carry a chain-gun, and wear that godawful striped shirt? That's not what Russians are like! Oh, and I think they misused the doctor/psychopath character. They could've done something more with him in the end -- it would've been interesting to see him interact with the Predators and assist them in hunting down the remaining members of the group, but, instead, they chose to kill him off in a predictably dull and unimpressive fashion...Speaking of predictable... well, of course you know right from the start that the ""cool"" guy and the broad are going to live and everyone else will be killed off. No surprises there.But anyway... it's an interesting, suspenseful, well-crafted movie. A must-see.",Predators
184,robotbling,"A decent time waster, but still quite dumb",5,12 December 2011,"(www.plasticpals.com) The original Predator managed to achieve cult status and is often compared to the Aliens franchise, but it is unquestionably the lesser of the two. Several B-grade sequels and spin-offs have since tarnished whatever mystique the original film had, and well, the Predator's design is simply too cheesy to be taken seriously. Unlike the xenomorph in Alien, played by an unusually tall and skinny actor, in Predator it's nearly impossible to forget that you're looking at a stuntman in a bad costume. Luckily they have stealth camouflage and wear masks, so you won't have to look at their stupid faces much.The Predators are sophisticated enough to have mastered interstellar travel, but apparently haven't abandoned their primal hunter-gatherer roots. We're expected to believe that their primary goal is to improve their hunting skills, so they've converted an entire planet into an exotic game reserve. The aliens hand-pick human prey based on their lethality stemming from such diverse backgrounds as Yakuza gangster and deathrow inmate. Adrien Brody stars as the typical tough as nails ex-marine and reluctant leader. He's an odd choice for an action hero, but he beefed up for the role and is a decent foil for the less heartless Alice Braga (City of God). Topher Grace (That '70s Show), Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix), and Danny Trejo (Machete) round out the human team.As luck would have it, the alien planet looks a lot like any jungle on Earth. I was hoping that would leave a big chunk of the budget for some impressive special effects, but was sorely disappointed. There's only one type of creature in the film besides the Predators, and they aren't as convincing as the dinosaurs in the original Jurassic Park. But perhaps the worst special effect of all is Fishburne's acting, which is simply embarrassing to watch (not that you can blame him for phoning it in).The film quickly falls prey to its own tired formula, as the humans are picked off one by one in surprisingly unimaginative fashion with none of the suspense normally associated with the genre. If you're looking for a sci-fi film about a group of strangers forced to cooperate when they're thrown into a strange and dangerous game, I would suggest you check out Cube (it does a lot more with a lot less). Predators is not something I would watch again, but it did manage to hold my interest for its duration during a late night Netflix hunt – which should not be taken as a recommendation.",Predators
185,cadillac20,Now this is an action film!,8,9 July 2010,"To say that this summer has been disappointing at the cinema might be putting it mildly. While there have been a few films here and there that have been entertaining, only Toy Story 3 has been a standout. However, that is about to change with July promising a good share of great films. First up is the right kind of kick in the balls that the summer needed. Predators is a film that hearkens back to the original with the right amount of adrenaline and badassery needed for a good summer blockbuster.There is a fair amount of nods to the original here, but the film manages to be its own entity as well. The plot is fairly straight forward and typical. A bunch of badasses find themselves stranded on another planet where they are being hunted by Predators, the aliens which have become one of Fox's most iconic since their debut in the 80's. Once our crew figures out what's going on, they attempt to find a way off the planet.The film plays much the same way the original did, minus the whole beginning. Here, from the outset, our heroes are hunted. Adrian Brody leads the pack, and he is fantastic at the part. Brody once again shows he is capable of taking any role he sinks his teeth into, and after his role in High School and Splice, he is poised to set himself up as one of today's most diverse actors. Sure, he's not the brawny, intimidating Schwarzenegger, but he is very commanding in this role. The rest of the cast is also great, with a nice diversity amongst them, from stoic killers to wild murderers. Laurence Fishburn seems a little useless here, as he only shows up for a couple short scenes, but seeing him play a crazy guy is kind of fun.While the film could have been a compromise between Predator 1 and 2, it instead sticks close to the original, with a slow build up and then a full on second hour with plenty of action and even multiple Predators for everyone's delight. Though, I must say I missed seeing the multiple technology that the Predators possess. A bit more Predator 2 would have been a little nice. Hopefully the sequel will include more weapons and technology. But, it was nice to see a slow reveal of the Predators here, and there is even a little bit more of their culture exposed in what seems to be a ranking order. Personally, I liked the new Predators shown. It's nice to see a bit more variety in the species. It probably won't be to everyone's liking, notably hard core fans of the original. But, I found it very interesting and liked the addition. I will say that I think that the film was missing a little of that intimidation that the original possessed. Of course, that's understandable since it's been over 20 years. However, it's still a fun ride. There's plenty of Predator action here, including several truly awesome and stylish scenes, such as the Pred on Pred battle and a duel under a full moon. While this may not quite live up to the machismo and height of the original, there is hardly anything that could. Still, it's a damn good effort and easily the second best addition to the series. Rodriguez did about as much as we could have hoped for the film, and that's thankful. You could say that this almost feels like the original, with very few CG FX and a very similar 80's, B film feel to it, just as the original had done. Anyone who was a fan of the original should definitely be pleased. And even if you're not, this should keep any action film and anyone waiting for THE first great action film of the summer happy.",Predators

The film starts with Adrien Brody in a midair plunge to a mysterious jungle below. He wakes and finds Danny Trejo, a Russian man with a Gattling Gun, and an equally mysterious woman with a sniper rifle, all caring for only their own safety. Eventually they find a Prison Convict, a Sierra Leon soldier, a Yakuza gangster, and a mysterious doctor played by Topher Grace. Soon the ""Predators"" arrive, and we realize that these characters have been dropped onto a game preserve to fight to the finish with these horrific creatures. Now I can say that cheesy line; ""Let the Games Begin."" If you're looking for a reason to spend a couple almost mindless hours in an air-conditioned room, watching Adrien Brody and a ton of other macho dudes (and a chick!) duke it out with ugly aliens, this is the film for you. The lines are worth a chuckle sometimes (""I missed my ride"", ""You got a name?"") but that's okay. I find that Adrien Brody wasn't built for this kind of character. If Jason Statham had been cast, I might have liked the role of Noyce a little better, but that may just be because I like seeing Brody play complicated men in dramedies, not beefed-up Blacks OPS guys blowing things up in the jungle.The rest of the cast is fine. Danny Trejo is such a cool guy to see, no matter what role he's in, no matter how small. I can't wait for ""Machete"" to come out. Alice Braga is a surprisingly good heroine, but I think Michelle Rodriguez would have been a more believable choice. Laurence Fishburne's little cameo isn't quite wasted, but they could have done a lot more with him than they did. Topher Grace showed his stripes here.

189,Craig_McPherson,A Pure Popcorn Frag Fest,8,9 July 2010,"In the past 30 years (yes, it's been that long) Hollywood has managed to spawn two iconic horror critters, both out of the Sci-Fi mold: the Xenomorph which debuted in Ridley Scott's 1979 movie Alien, and the Yautja, better known as the Predator from the 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger film.Never one to let go of a cash cow, film studios have spewed forth numerous sequels for both creatures, and even brought the two together for a couple of movie frag fests.Predators, the latest entry, tries to bring a clever twist to the Yautja franchise, and largely succeeds due to some (surprisingly) above average screen writing and a generally decent cast.Directed by Nimród Antal and produced by Robert Rodriguez, it tells the story of a disparate group of soldiers, mercenaries and criminals who awaken from a blackout to find themselves in free fall above a tropical jungle. Parachutes open to break their fall, but they have no recollection of how they got there, or where they are.Led by the surprisingly buff Adrien Brody who put on weight and underwent weight training for the role of Royce, an American mercenary, the group quickly becomes the 10 Little Indians of children's rhyme lore, decreasing by one during each action packed scene, except this film doesn't quite follow the nursery rhyme script, with the Earthlings giving as good as they get.Several cuts above (pardon the turn of phrase) the sequels that followed the '87 Arnie film, yet not breaking much in the way of new ground story wise beyond the big game preserve angle, Predators marks the high point (thus far) in an otherwise dismal summer movie season. Yes it's predictable in places, but it's surprisingly clever in others.

It has a good concept and it's certainly better than the AvP films but it did have an air of predictability to it.It needed a real kick arse action scene in it, which I guess is why they put the pred dogs in it but you has this gnawing feeling that you were aware of how quickly or slowly they would kill off the members of the team or the predators.In the first you had the big action scene to kill loads at the camp and then the predator picked them all off, in predator 2 you had the pred killing off loads of human and in AvP (which i'm not defending) you had either humans, aliens or preds being killed.It felt like, to me, that I could feel how they couldn't afford to kill off a pred here or a human there. And please, the doctor was so unnecessary. Have a medic along to patch up the wounded prey but to have gone to the effort of selecting a criminal that has even been caught indicates that the preds would have gone way too far in securing some 'fresh meat'.Obviously it couldn't touch Predator and I don't think it was as good as Predator 2. I'm disappointed that in the reviews & interviews they are trying to have this running straight after the 1st and ignore the 2nd one.Although Predator 2 isn't great (Maria Conchita Alonso's acting is probably the worst ever committed to film) it does still have some stand out scenes - the penthouse massacre, King Willy in the alley, Glover's dismissive face-clap, the subway shoot out and the abattoir attack. Predators had one, maybe two.So it could be worth checking out, does have some tension and is entertaining but if I had a choice of what to watch again over a pizza I'd still go Predator 1 or 2.PS. The film company really does need to be sued or reprimanded for the blatantly misleading trailer. It shows Brady at the end standing on top of the windswept ship with about 10 red dot targets appearing on his body. At that actual moment in the film there are only two preds left!

The chemistry and relationships between him and the others is very incoherent. This is an example of a movie that the X-Box generation might understand, but not someone older like me. It has a lot of what other people complain about with digital effects that look sloppy. Since when, in a thriller movie, do the chances of survival increase once your ammunition runs out, you're tired, and on the aliens' home turf!!!! If this was a hunt which it was supposed to be, how can Adrien Brody be running rings around these aliens in the end???? I swear, he takes his shirt off, and he looks like skin and bones and it is really laughable. Maybe simply trying what Schwarzenegger did in the first one is supposed to intimidate the aliens.

Cliched, badly written dialogues, involving group dynamics, that were already seen many times. Boring, one dimensional characters, whose motivation is mostly stupid. But the biggest let down is the action. The tactics of the Predators is absent, no diversity in weaponry, horrible CGI when it comes to explosions.In the end, it's not any better than Alien Vs Predator. At least that one had one good fight between the creatures.",Predators
197,Carrigon,Mass of Confusion,3,11 July 2010,"No real spoilers here. Basically, each drawn out scene was just jawdropping, but not because of the movie being anywhere near okay, but because it was done so badly.How do you have Laurence Fishburne and Danny Trejo in an action movie and waste them? Their scenes were so much of a waste. They should have been the main characters. Instead, we got Adrien Brody. And I just sat there throughout the whole movie, staring at Adrien Brody, thinking he's some kind of poor man's hell version of Sly Stallone. He just wasn't making the grade here. Who did this casting? OMG. And the rest of the cast were just zeros. Might as well have cast anyone off the street here. My mail lady is more memorable.The plot sucked, mostly because the Predators themselves never explain what's going on. And it was just a confusing mess.The only part of the production team that really rocked were the makeup fx people. They got the Predators right and the other creatures.The movie was disappointing with a bad cast and a junky script. I wanted to like it, but the longer it went on, the worse it got.

As if AVP 1 and 2 wasn't bad enough we are given Predators which is basically a wannabe Predator that totally cons its audience.I'm not going to explain this pile of $hit to you, you can find out for yourself. But let me say a huge f*** you to the makers of this garbage and all the morons that think this movie is 'awesome'.Half way through Predators, I was pining to see the original just to get Predators out of my head, it was like being homesick or something. I half wanted Arnie to come onto the set during the film and beat the living $hit out of the cast with Carl Weathers.Predators is nothing more than a cheap, empty imitation that rips everything off from Predator to steal your money.Another atrocity of a film.",Predators
199,Minus_The_Beer,To Catch a Predator,7,24 October 2010,"By the release of 2007's dismal ""Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem,"" the ""Predator"" franchise was all but left for dead. Then, a miracle happened as Robert Rodriguez (""Planet Terror,"" ""Desperado"") got his hands on the property. Drawing from a script he had originally penned in the mid-90's, Rodriguez teamed up with director Nimród Antal (""Vacancy"") in an effort to restore the series to its roots. ""Predators,"" the latest saga concerning the jungle-dwelling hunters, is an action-packed roller-coaster ride that successfully ignores the maligned ""Alien vs. Predator"" franchise and plays as more of a direct sequel to the 1987 original.Although there's no Arnold Schwarzenegger or even a ""CHOPPAH!"" to be found, ""Predators"" succeeds in delivering the same high-octane thrills as the original film. Although admittedly not as fueled by testosterone as its predecessor, ""Predators"" gets by with a solid cast that includes Adrien Brody as the unlikely hero of the story, as well as Alice Braga, Danny Trejo and Topher Grace. Dumped on an alien planet against their will, this group of unsavory characters finds themselves being hunted by a gaggle of bizarre and deadly creatures, the least of which being the titular character(s). Brody has big shoes to fill – essentially replacing Arnie as Dutch – and wouldn't you know it, the Oscar winning actor pulls it off. Laurence Fishburne also appears, making the best of a brief appearance. Fishburne chews up the screen and steals just about every scene in perhaps his juiciest role since ""The Matrix."" The film certainly has the Rodriguez touch, but Antal definitely puts on a good show on his own. Not only does the film look good (taking advantage of its Hawaiian location), but it is every bit as fast-paced and fun as it should be, too. The only real flaw at hand would be that the central characters aren't fleshed out enough for us to truly connect with them. While the actors themselves turn in fine performances, it's the fault of the script for not giving us enough to care about when the group starts getting picked off one by one. In the end, though, it doesn't serve to tear down the good times at hand. ""Predators"" is a more than worthy trip back to the jungle and aims to please its core audience. Possibly the most faithful sequel in recent memory, it's worth watching to be reminded of a time when sci-fi and action were at their peak and goofy looking creatures from across the universe rocked our collective world.",Predators
200,jonnyfendi,"They Are Killing ""The Predator""!",5,18 July 2010,"The original ""Predator"" in 1987 is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's legendary movies. Now, they try to extend the saga into a new chapter, in ""Predators"" with the extra word 'S' that is expected to be multiplied in all aspects (I guess). But what I see from thiz new constellation is just a movie with a repetitive formula and setting. The formula is still a typical mysterious introduction to the creatures what we called Predators and how a group of soldiers die one by one, until the last victim. The setting is still in a tropical jungle, exactly what we have seen in Schwarzenegger's version. Thiz one is officially the third Predator movies since the first ""Predator"" in 1987 and ""Predator 2"" in 1990, plus two spin-off when Predators clash with the Aliens (another iconic Hollywood creatures) in ""AVP"" (2004) and ""AVP 2: Requiem"" (2007). Unfortunately, I can almost say that thiz one could easily fall into B-Class movie with B-Class Actors such as Alice Braga, Topher Grace and others. The only exception (of course) is on Adrien Brody's performance, his attempt to become action hero must put as a great credit itself. Brody is success to build his body and delivers some fierce hero attitude through his accent and voice characteristic. The other brief but convincing appearance made by Laurence Fishburne. I went to watch thiz movie because I wanted to see what could the Director Nimrod Antal offers for his next project, since his latest movie ""Vacancy"" (2008) successfully provides an intriguing and effective thriller. In thiz Predator movie, Antal doesn't make a new innovation. In fact, he brings many copy-paste elements from the first original movie. I'm afraid if they keep doing thiz without any significant innovation, they might have killed Predators forever.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",Predators
201,DanLives1980,"From a converted skeptic, Predators deserves better attention!",8,25 February 2013,"I avoided Predators for years, not only refusing to believe that it could be the sequel the franchise deserves, but believing in a lot of negative and uncontructive criticism. After finally buying it on DVD (I felt I had a duty as an old-school fan), I can now say that I was wrong to believe the critics. Predators is everything it should have been and more! What is a sequel/reboot today if it is not one that has learned from the mistakes of those that have already come and gone? Predators says that it is one that has learned a lot, solidly believes in itself and therefore has the balls to take all the right risks, and thankfully, the many creative gambles attributed to this science fiction action-fest are what sets it apart from others.When you look at the characters, the actors and the plot line, you are rightly worried about how bad this film could be. But here's the shocker. As cheesy as it may seem to chuck a rag tag team of soldiers and professional killers together (as it was in the original Predator) and as mundane as it might seem to have a plot completely based around monsters hunting down people one by one in a jungle (again, like the original).And also as completely unprepared and mismatched as the cast of Predators seems, they each do a damn good job to make sure that you don't know what you think you know about the way this film turns out. Adrien Brody, Walton Goggins, Alice Braga and Oleg Taktarov especially shone in Predators and it's nice to see a cast of underdogs provide a seemingly basic script with an injection of purely likable character.So the story is that a mismatched collective of humans find themselves extracted from their own individual realities and placed in an unknown and seemingly endless jungle where nothing seems quite human or more specifically earth-like.Before long, they team together to escape, only to gather that they are being hunted by an unseen assassin. But before long, as the odds of getting home shrink to zero and as they discover the true nature of their hunter, the team breaks down and begin having to resort to desperate measures to survive the Predators.This film does two things majorly right; One, it captures the exact same atmosphere and quality of the original Schwarzenegger hit regarding the look, the feel and the buildup of events. Rightly adding the original mythology, it also lends a few visuals from the Alien movies at times for retro chills, but everything is as it should be and the Predators are first class beasts.Two, whereas for marketing purposes it distances itself from Predator 2, it actively swerves the AvP movies and I couldn't be happier. The visual effects are a lot more practical (added by necessity rather than providing a CGI blowout in the absence of actual substance). This film is not stylised to show off the Predators or to fuel anybody's ego. It is made simply to capture what made the Predator great, thrills, scares and grisly fight scenes.Predators is a great sci-fi action adventure that stays true to the mythology while offering first class thrills and yet dares to be that little bit different to other movies, rather than attempt to completely facelift the series. My only bother with it is the ending, but that's just my opinion!",Predators
202,SeriousJest,The Best Predator Sequel I've seen (including AVP),8,26 December 2011,"This is the best Predator sequel yet (including AVP: Alien vs. Predator). It did two very important things that sequels are supposed to do: (1) improved characters (more interesting because of their diverse backgrounds, as well as the intrigue surrounding their mysterious backgrounds); (2) and added plot elements (not only are the protagonists trying to survive the Predators, of which there are now different kinds, as well as the unique and dangerous setting, but they're also trying to find out where they are, how they got there, why they're there, whom they're fighting alongside, and how to get back home). For bonus points, the film also included a healthy dose of well- done homages to the original, but done differently enough so that they weren't just easy rips.Another mark of a successful sequel is a beefed-up cast. I gotta call it a tie here. As pure thespians, there's no question that the actors in Predators are better. Fishburne (even though he looks out-of-shape for his role), Brody (who obviously busted his ass to get in shape for this role), Danny Trejo, Alice Braga, and Grace are recognized and accomplished names, and they performed at or above expectations; the rest of the cast was also very solid, executing their well-written roles just as well as some of the bigger names. But as pure action stars, the trio of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, and Jesse Ventura was awesome, and the rest of the original cast was just as solid in their performances.Finally, the one area in which Predators fell short of the original film was in the action, but not my much. In fact, one scene involving a sword in Predators was almost as exciting as Bill Duke's last stand in Predatoralmost.",Predators
203,MovieProductions,"While it starts off anticlimactic and uninteresting, it gets better as it progresses",6,15 July 2010,"**1/2 out of (****)""Predators"" is that one action film that is completely redundant, predictable, and cliché, but at the same time it's entertaining and climactic. I've never seen the original (yes, saying that makes me feel ashamed to be a movie fan), but even I, could see that this bares way too much resemblance to the original judging by trailers and advertisements. I know this film is suppose to be a sequel to its predecessor, the namesake 1987 action film extravaganza, pretending like the sequel to the Arnold motion picture never happened, but it's still inexcusable. Okay, maybe the headline of my review is misleading. This film starts off very interesting, even though you know what to expect, but in the middle section of this sequel, it comes off as tedious and a chore to sit through because of an unnecessary back story. Although, the film gains momentum after the film's middle section.I feel that a summary of this film is inappropriate. Most audiences have seen the original or have seen the advertisements, so I'm going straight to the review. First off, I thought the performances were great. Yes, calling them three dimensional might be a stretch, but this is probably the best modern-day acting (which again, isn't really saying a lot). Moreover, I thought the direction was great. It was pretty blatant that the director knew what he was doing. Additionally, I thought the last action sequence was simply breathtaking. One of the best cinematic finales. To add to that, I liked how this film built suspense rather than just going for the goods. A true director, will develop its characters and plot, before taking those two elements somewhere. Furthermore the special effects and cinematography are terrific.Now onto the negatives. First of all, I thought that it was pointless for the film to take two thirds of its running time, just to develop characters and acting. We already know what's in the jungle and that people are going to be picked off one by one. The one film's major misstep is the pacing. Furthermore, like I mentioned, by the looks of it, this movie bared a little too much resemblance to the original. Moreover, I thought this movie lacked in gore. Movies don't need gore for quality, if that's the case, Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 would be the best film of all time *shivers*, but for this type of movie, it would have helped.Overall, ""Predators"" may be disposable and completely redundant, it is an enjoyable ride while it lasts. The acting and direction are very solid. The cinematography is also eye- popping and so are the special effects. ""Predators"" comes as a mild recommendation. Seek out a matinée.",Predators

205,InaneSwine,A tight action film with a solid cast,7,18 February 2016,"Three years passed between the poor Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem and this, the second true sequel in the Predator franchise. And it's not until you see it that you realise what an embarrassment the AVP films really were, to both franchises. Ripping both sets of characters out of their original setting and slapping them in well-worn horror environments, they could have easily killed them off for good. Thankfully and quite rightly, Predators clearly wants nothing to do with them, and pretends it's the first Predator film since 1987's Schwarzenegger-manly-menly-man-man feast. So I'll carry out the remainder of this review as the filmmakers clearly want: as though it is.The setting, first of all, brings us right back into the mood established by the original. It puts the creature back in its natural habitat. The jungle is where we first encountered it, and it should never really have left. The first half hour or so is very effective, and the broad and beautiful forest that surrounds our main characters never detracts from the ""bottle episode"" tone. The pace builds up slowly, allowing us ample time to get to know our characters. It's definitely been done better, but it's still done fairly decently here.Oddly enough, I was almost a little disappointed when we did eventually find the titular beasts. I was so engrossed by the characters exploring their surroundings, finding out who each other was and their purpose for being there, I nearly forgot I was watching a Predator film. Nonetheless, the filmmakers have become wiser, picking up a few handy tips from the first couple of Alien films and the original '87 outing. Less is more. The fewer sightings we get of the villain, the scarier they become.Other than a few silly plot twists here and there, Predators does a fine job of re-establishing the validity of the franchise, and functions in its own right as a tight action film with a solid cast.",Predators
206,MovieZoo,"Predators: Bad guys fight bad guys, making a good movie",7,9 July 2010,"The spoilers within should provide no surprising elements. But there is information which you may not want to know because some observations may sway you from wanting to see the movie. None of these observations should keep you from going. However, the non-spoiler comments may be enough to keep you from going.Getting right to the not-so-revealing spoilers, Adrian Brody would be wise to leave out the faux-""Bale Batman"" voice. Brody is not the tough guy he may want his fans to believe. To me, and this is not a slam against his talent, he is always going to appear punkish. Trying to sound like Batman was not wise. Forgetting his voice, he has a grasp on the emotional values of his character. He takes on the role of leader with surprising and unexpected ease. Personally I think he was miscast as the leader but I could not imagine any of the others as the leader either. So he wins by default and he actually comes out of it as a valid winner.Topher Grace....wow, what can one say? Eddie Brock again?? WTH? Seriously, get past the Eddie Brock phase. Leave Spiderman 3 behind. Bad guys don't have to be whiners! The Brock-like whining was way out of line.Walton Goggins was, by far, my favorite actor in this movie. His character was not much different from Boyd Crowder in Justified. Sleazy and persistently creepy but interesting and true to life(if you ever knew someone like Crowder).Alice Braga is as interesting as she is fun to look at. Michelle Rodriguez, make room for Alice.Two of my complaints were actually near movie killers. While I believe most people pay no attention to it, scoring in this movie was so far off mark throughout most of the movie it was distracting. It often felt like someone lifted the music from another style of movie, maybe a Coen brothers drama. Chase scenes sometimes felt less dramatic thanks to what I felt were musical miscues. Battles almost didn't feel like battles. Those and other scenes would have been better if the music had fit the scenes. And not related to music, in one explosion scene, flames could not have looked more fake if they had hired a grade school art teacher to fill the screen with comic book flames - totally out of place. It may work in cartoons, but the movie was far better than any cartoon.As far as the movie itself goes, I enjoyed this as a great follow-up to the Predator movies, and was much better than AVP. The Earth people we can all relate to are somehow kidnapped without explanation either to us or even the characters that were kidnapped. They all wake up as they drop in on a planet via parachute. They quickly realize they are the prey on a planet supposedly used as a game preserve. Strangers deal with strangers as potential enemies only to find that they are on the same side whether they like it or not. More ammunition is lost than is love when the actual enemy makes its appearance. This is one of the mysteries for me: once the search for the enemy began, it seemed there would be an army of Predators, but eventually, it seemed more likely there were only a few. By the end of the movie it became apparent a sequel will reveal more of these Predators.The action, tension, and character interaction were most enjoyable while the plot was simple yet fulfilling. A couple unexpected moments played well.I am willing to give it a 7 out of 10 despite my complaints because it was better than an adrenaline junkies dream thanks to thoughtful directing, acting, planning and filming.",Predators
207,mdnobles19,They should be predators for releasing this chunk of cheese,4,10 July 2010,"Well I'm not really familiar with the original but if it's anything like this waste of time and to me a failed attempt to revive a series than it's overrated. To be honest they miscast Adrien Brody as the lead heroine because he is no Arnold Schwarzenegger and even though he got ripped and gave a decent performance he is no bad@ss. This movie was a complete disappointment to me and treated us like dummies, I mean stop spelling everything out and get to the good stuff we're not braindead! I thought the creatures were goofy looking and were not scary or menacing enough and the gore and CGI were weak to me and the plot and script were nonsense and idiotic. The movie dragged in some parts believe it or not and I found myself dozing off now and then and I thought to myself is this movie for real, where are all the thrills, chills, scares and entertainment, everything came off pretty generic and syfy channel movie of the week, this is B-movie all the way and not really in a good way either. I am sick of all these lame reboots and remakes because most of them so far suck and are weak efforts and they need to stop unless they're going to bring their A-game and outdo the original. Overall I don't really have anything positive to say about this movie other than the somewhat promising beginning other than that it's unfortunately a waste of time and money and what's with the out of place end credits song, very silly.

208,The-Social-Introvert,Frustration is reborn,2,24 August 2014,"When I first saw this film on the big screen, I didn't like it. When I saw it again on DVD, I still didn't like it. After my third viewing, I didn't like it, and felt compelled to write a review on it.Let's get things straight – Predators is a sequel. The movie is not a reboot of Predator; Robert Rodriguez confirms this. It is important to get this fact out of the way in order for me to get some of my points clear.These are the aspects of the movie I feel are most important to discuss:Character building – There is none of it. The script has the cast literally thrown into the story via parachutes (some working better than others). From there they attempted to work out what has happened, why, and try to find their way out. Throughout the film, we never feel connected with any of the characters; even the lead, played by Adrian Brody, is forever distant from both the audience and the other characters. Each of the crew seem to have something stolen from the characters from the first film, which brings me to my second point. Homages. It's all well paying tribute ti the original film, but when you realize that you're sitting through a whole movie compromising of poorly recreated scenes from Predator, it gets annoying. This is defiantly my main complaint about the movie. I mean, honestly, I couldn't keep count of the amount of lines taken from the first film (and ruined). The setting, even though it's supposed to be on a different planet, looks like a lamely constructed set designed to recreate the awesome jungle layout in Predator. Even the music is the same, abet ruined with a rock theme. But when it comes to complying the original, the worst was certainly left to the characters and the scenes. Billy's character was swapped with a Yakuza who doesn't provide the film with much, aside from a similar death scene to Billy's. Both characters are supposed to be mysterious and silent, and with Billy it was cool but the Yakuza didn't seem to fit; it was as if he'd turned up to the wrong film audition. Also, both characters stay behind when the group is fleeing to have a standoff, meeting their ends when the do. Suspicious? I'm pretty sure it's gonna past that stage. Tough-as-nails Blaine was replaced with a Russian dude who even had the same mini-gun! This is a character that could have become solid but instead ended up being a trigger-happy moron. The female character is quite clearly supposed to be some sort of replica of Carrillo's Character – she even shares a similar story with the rest of the solders like Anna did. The list of copied scenes and lines is endess, from falling down waterfalls and covering up in mud to the ""I can make it"" scene and the famous ""Do it! Do it now!"" line. Heck, Brody even used Christian Bale's Batman voice to say it. To add insult to injury a serial killer is added to the mix who decides the right time to reveal his identity is when he should have been fearing for his life. And what's with the totally unrealistic actions of that characters? Muslims pray towards the Ka'ba and yet Mombasa in in prostration in a random direction. Plus if I was stuck on an aline planet I certainly wouldn't be planning a ""Bitch-raping spree."" Homages? Defiantly the wost part about this movie. The Chance to expand great concepts and ideas. A war raging between two predator races? Ever fan's dream! However, these ""super"" predators turn out to be nothing more than guerrillas in suits. There were some half - developed idead that just faded as the movie progressed. The deaths. One of the best thing about the the predator creature is its unique and ever changing ways to trick, hunt, and kill its' prey. As I've said before, a lot of scenes (and that includes the deaths) are just reenactments of kills in the original film. There is nothing creative or new being done by these predators. That said, there was one good scene -the ""help me"" part was great and, although not entirely original, is the only scene that gave me the chills. The hunters' technology. There were some great weapons in the first film (who can forget the awesome shoulder canon?) and the second gave us more (the classic spear, the disk etc.) but these with thesenothing. It was just more of the same, only executed poorly. Even then, some of the traditional weapons are no where to be scene (so much for a homage movie). And what did that leave? A camouflage that looked as though it had been drawn on by a three year old. Pred Tech? A step backwards in this category.Full Review: http://cineranter.wordpress.com/2012/04/07/movie-review- predators/",Predators
209,evan_harvey,Average,2,7 July 2010,"Just saw it at an advance screening. Robert Rodriguez did a Q & A and talked it up a bit, but now I just want to slap the guy. 15 years he's been working on it?! Is he mad? Thankfully it's not another Alien v Predator yawn-fest. Unfortunately it's a dull movie without much action at all. The characters are weak, the action weak, the plot thin.Adrien Brody might be an okay tough guy, but he's never actually given the chance to dominate the screen like Arnie did (and that wasn't just due to Arnie's muscles). He isn't given the situations or presence to cement himself as the hero type: it's just that compared to the other useless bodies traipsing around, he's the only contender. The other actors are limp. None of them act like the 'monsters' of our world that they're supposed to be. They also completely figured out *exactly* what was happening within about 20 minutes without even seeing a Predator.The action is very slow. There's four main advancements to the plot, but they're very weak. The second one at the Predator camp had potential, but then it got wrecked by not keeping up any pace afterwards. Then it heads for Pandorum-sh territory and starts to suck even more. The best part is at the end, when something actually starts happening. Until then, hit fast forward. Even the Samurai fight was just tossed in. It was okay, but there was no actual build up to it. Why did the guy just decide to stop and fight? Poor, poor scripting.The plot isn't too bad (although it's pretty b-grade and raises some ludicrous concepts), it was just poorly done. Rodriguez said in the before show Q & A that the film was 'relentless', but it was mostly just boring. I never expected it to be as good as the first Predator movie, but really nothing happened. There was no real set-up, no purpose. Some decent ideas (the 'dog' creatures and their purpose) but they were never used to provide action. It was like the writers came up with some okay ideas and then just tossed them in and congratulated themselves, as if thinking that that alone would carry the film.All that being said, it's still the second best Predator film (the alien ones sucked) and at least tries to take it back to the original (sort of). However, it was a very average by-the-numbers script that didn't allow for any real action or strong characters.5/10 as just another throw-away average film. 1/10 for sucking and wasting the goodwill of the Predator name.",Predators
210,copperncherrio,Not bad.,6,13 March 2011,"I did not expect anything wonderful for this is the first Predator movies in the series that I have seen.My thirst for entertainment in this dry spell of a season has surprisingly been quenched by Predators. It has just enough humor and real twist that I was entertained and surprised. Of course, I was watching it with my boyfriend and I guessed the correct order of who died. But there was such a satisfaction with this movie in just pure entertainment and completeness.The plot is basic, where a bunch of soldiers and fighters are dropped on a random planet to be hunted by the predators one by one. There's just one scene that's corny But they picked a great cast and the small twists were actually surprising.AlsoI love Adrien Brody No matter how big his nose looks on screen.",Predators
211,SquirePM,One hell of a monster movie!,8,27 July 2010,"This is a first-rate movie made to the highest standards all the way. It addresses its status as a sequel in all the best ways, and at the same time forges ahead into new ground, new adventures and new characters.It's also a subtle film, filled with homages, probably more than I caught, because they are so low key. They are just in there for us to see, not trumpeted with splashy fanfares. If you keep your eyes open for them they add a lot of enjoyment and richness to an already high quality film. The story was thoroughly developed, crafted, revised and thought through. It shows the depth and refinement of a good collaborative effort between the writers.So what's all this highbrow analysis doing in the review of a monster movie? Well, this is one hell of a monster movie! It works on all levels. It's certainly a slam-bang action movie. It challenges fans of the original movies (You think predators are bad? Welcome to the home planet, where they've got predators that hunt predators!) and delivers it all with proper respect, and in a logical way.And then the twists. I think there are two big ones, you may think there are more. And when it comes to one big revelation, even though it doesn't take long, it's executed in full scale glory, spectacular as can be, and it stands up to and surpasses the similar scenes we've been treated to in many, many space epics since the beginning of sci-fi.I was hoping for an interesting story, a bunch of human killers, each one different but the elite in their own ways, pitted against those tough, wily, technically superior predators. I just hoped it wouldn't be flat, predictable and boring. What I got was a nice big surprise: a class- A film that draws on the originals, delivers creative new developments, has a well thought out story line, good acting and great directing.

Sure, some parts could have been given a bit more thought and though the actors actually do an okay job, don't expect character deepness, epic lines or anything. Also if you're looking for snappy dialog or a complex plot, this is not your movie and please avoid. But though a lot of dedicated predator fans will moan their asses off, you are given a fair chance to like this a lot. Now is it as good as the original has been in 1987? Probably not and probably a stupid question. Is it much better then it could have been? Yes, a hell of a lot. 6/10",Predators
213,hackraytex,Predator Franchise Rocks!,10,28 February 2018,"Except for the Fast and Furious franchise, the Predator franchise has limitless possibilities. They have successfully taken this franchise in four directions. Besides the Predator and AVP directions, it is clear why the studio chose this project instead of a sequel to AVP2. The opening for a sequel for Predators is at the end when Royce and Isabelle see about 12 more parachutes coming down and Royce says, ""Now let's find a way off this f****** planet."" If they can get these two back, it can go with them linking with the new arrivals to get to the ship that brings the next set of predators. Of course they would have to kill them all off so no one can blow up the ship but good screenwriters can make that happen. BTW I know it would have probably not fit into the plot but I was surprised that Danny Trejo did not last very long and was the first to go and I would have liked to have seen Nicolai survive. It is time for a sequel to Predators. Really good movie regardless of what the ""critics"" say.",Predators
214,dudedazzreviews,Very disappointing!,2,12 October 2010,"Predators doesn't live up to the first movie and, worse still, it doesn't live up to the second either. It's storyline is very tedious and simplistic – it's a violent game of cat-and-mouse thrown in with some people who are either careless and maniacal or just plain bland, the subplot involving Nolad's character didn't help matters either.The movie follows Adrien Brody's character Royce, who is abducted by an alien race and released along with seven other professional killers on an alien planet. On the planet, they meet Nolad, who is played by Laurence Fishburne, who has been surviving on the planet for years and tells the group they were chosen so the Predators could train their skills and so, the group must find a way to survive and escape the planet. It could have been a little more enjoyable if the movie didn't take itself seriously. The main problem with Predators is the whole story. It just started to become boring within minutes of the movie starting and it tries to make up for it by mindless violence and gore and even then, the action scenes weren't so great. The movie opened okay as we jump right into the action but soon after the group land on ground and the dialogue starts, that was when the movie started to lose interest and credibility and that was when the unnecessary scenes started. The characters talked about nothing interesting and they didn't talk about anything that was relevant to the movie, it was either pointless and quite annoying.Predators just doesn't stop with the problems and the flaws it has as the characters had no personality to them, except for what they do such as a scientist, a prisoner, a member of the Yakuza and a mercenary. If the writers left that little bit of information out, there would be no point to any of the characters whatsoever, none of them stood out and you didn't care about what happened to them. Another problem with the movie is the acting. Don't get me wrong, there are some fine actors in this movie such as Adrien Brody, Laurence Fishburne, Alice Braga and Topher Grace but you can't help but wonder how they weren't good in this movie and furthermore, you question what they're doing in this movie. Adrien Brody was the youngest actor to win an Academy Award for Best Male Actor for his performance in The Pianist and yet he did a poor job in this movie, he wasn't convincing at all as tough guy Royce. It felt like Brody was trying to copy Christian Bale's hoarse Batman voice as he hardly moved his jaw and he spoke as if he was in desperate need of water. You have a sudden urge to cram a Strepsil or a Locket down his throat. Another irk was how his character suddenly worked everything out just by doing the smallest of things, you began to think he'd tell us the entire history of the planet when he brushed an eyelash or scratched his head, it quickly became annoying. Laurence Fishburne wasn't too bad as Nolad but I've certainly seen him do a lot better in movies such as The Matrix and the fantastic Akeelah and the Bee so the acting lets the movie down even more.The action didn't keep your attention at all, it was uninspiring, boring and had been done before so much better a million times before. There was one particular scene in the movie that was well done and that was, what I like to call, 'the booby-traps' scene. What happens here is one of the one-dimensional characters steps on a massive log in their path and the whole group start avoiding traps, such as falling spikes from trees and camouflaged spike pits. It was very well executed but straight after that scene, it just went back to being tedious and the dialogue being cringe-worthy. Not only is it possibly one of the worst science-fiction movies ever but it's also one of the worst movies 2010 has had so far. One could even go so far to say that it's possibly ruined the Predator series, as it was just unnecessary and just daft.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",Predators

Let's talk about Predators.The concept was great, humans dropped in another planet, but the predators are on their way.The soundtrack was good, John Debney did something in the style of the original soundtrack of Alan Silvestri.We have a few gore scenes, but they are worth waiting.The cast was great too: Adrien Brody, Danny Trejo and Alice Braga.I don't really have much else to say, but i have a few complains: The first part felt kinda ""slow"", but it wasn't boring as it looks like.I didn't liked how the classical sound effects where changed (especially the Predator scream !).",Predators

217,SPaS,Definitely one of the better offerings this summer,7,21 July 2010,"First things out of the way: I like the original. It's definitely in my top twenty action movies to grow up with when one's a kid in the eighties. I also like Predator 2. (Of course) it's not as good as the first one, but it has its undeniable strengths. It also contributes to the whole mythos, and these additions - the spear, the look of their ship, hunting methods, social behavior - have not since been questioned, but accepted. Halloween II - effect (lacking sequel, but Laurie is Michael's sister from then on) instead of the Elm Street 2 - effect (lacking sequel. So we can just ignore it).Predator 3 kicks on immediately (actually it offers pretty much the kick - assiest intro since, well, anything I recall) and the momentum carries on well into the second act. The end sags a bit, but it doesn't stall the movie. The characters are introduced and we are told just enough background so that it doesn't slow the ""scare-or-carnage/blow sh*t up"" - narrative down. Which actually pays off as we've already seen these characters about a hundred times. But, mostly thanks to inventive casting, I bought them. Mostly. The dialog could have been a bit better; sometimes it sounded like it belonged into a lesser movie. Like it was accommodated to more cardboard-y genre characters and they forgot to ""boost it up"" to level after casting did just that. The same goes for a few situations; mainly the repetitive scenes where the remaining cast walk up into a line, then stand and watch in amaze at the revelation. As it's revealed to the audience, we hear one of them say ""I think we're got a problem"" or some other classic hammy line. But Predators is a genre movie, and you can forgive a few speed bumps if the rest is good, and it *is*! IMHO the strongest assets are: Producer Rodriguez's magic touch makes the 45 million budget seem like an 80 million budget. The cast takes this a level up (regardless if they have to blurb out an establishing genre idiotism every now and then), and the director kicks this up an additional level. I can't believe it's the same guy who did that awful ""Armored"". (for those who haven't seen it it's as bad as this year's ""Losers"", and for those who have missed both ""Armored"" and ""Losers"", congratulations. They're both as bad as ""Speed 2"". I'm going to stop this now since you know what I'm aiming for).Predator 3 sports the feel and the look of the original, and it also uses Alan Silvestri's iconic soundtrack. Wwhich just started playing in my head and won't probably go away for a week. It also lifts a few ""cameos"" from the original, and on top of that, plot elements and situations. Up to a point where I found myself confused whether this was supposed to be a sequel or a remake. However, similarities can be at least partially explained; Predators' hunting tactics aren't changed that much. The setting in both this and the original is jungle. So, if both Arnie's and Brody's characters, survivor types with military training and practical long-time expertise on the field face up a similar challenge, wouldn't you expect similar results? Well, the escape-by-accident-via-high-drop-to-a-lake is a stretch, but then again, I'm also picking up a hint of something else: Rodriguez doesn't always take his movies completely seriously. So with all the remakes, reboots, re-imaginings and whatnot's, maybe Rodriguez pulled off his own thang; a sequel that's also kind of a quasi-remake. Maybe he'll come up with a name for it and the next 80s splatter remake uses this mold. Or maybe I'm reading too much into this. Perhaps Rodriguez's original 1995 script wanted to pay (too much) respect for the original and they didn't fix it now. But whatever the case, the plot could have used a bit more originality, since they mention the events of part 1 (clearly pointing out that this is supposed to be a sequel). Also, ignoring the events of Predator 2 completely feels to me, a fan, like a slap on the face. I would have liked it to be mentioned also. Even addressed to as an ""unconfirmed rumor"", if nothing else.Anyhow, Predators is the best thing on the silver screen the ""A or P"" line have had to offer in 20 years (yep, this is better than A3 or A4. Or those two so-called AvP schlocks) so... strongly recommended.",Predators
218,CelluloidDog,Underrated Sci-Fi Action-Thriller,7,30 November 2010,"Robert Rodriguez commented he drew his inspiration from the original Predator and not from Predator 2 or the Alien vs Predator films. His direction clearly shows since this really is the best Predator since the original (which I'd rate an 8). The film itself is nearly as good contrary to many comments here as the characters were developed and actually quite colorful. Many people were disappointed since they didn't see any ""heroes"". Well, there's a difference: in the original Predator, you had Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Sonny Landham and Jesse Ventura. They chose popular muscle men which made it easy since we identified automatically with them. In this darker 2010 version, there is no escape and the characters are lesser known actors except Danny Trejo, Lawrence Fishburn and Adrian Brody. The action was terrific and very intense. Special effects was well-balanced (not over CGIed) and the plot was actually quite original. People compared this movie to lots of things...but I think (besides the original Predator) the closest comparison was the original Star Trek named ""Arena"" with Captain Kirk fighting a reptilian alien. If I see two flaws, it's when Isabelle says she knows of the original Predator and how it was beaten (by Schwarzenegger) who covered his heat signature by putting cool mud on. Why didn't our protagonists do so in this film? They seemed so crafty. And also, if this film was to match the original, Rodriguez should make Fishburn and Trejo, two of his main characters instead of the small roles they had, similar to Carl Weathers and Jesse Ventura. It's easy for those guys to help drive the fun. Or add another star? Perhaps the budget was limited? It was harder for Brody and Braga to carry the movie, an ambitious attempt, but it doesn't have the muscle heroes people wanted. Finally Topher Grace was annoying. If a major Hollywood star like Sylester Stallone was chosen, everyone would be rating it a 7-8 instead of 1-3, which is really quite subjective. Oleg Taktarov was quite good as Nikolai and Adrian Brody and Alice Braga were excellent in their roles. Keep in mind that there are no ""heroes"" since the selected combatants are chosen mainly for their evil deeds as we found out with one seemingly innocuous character (I won't say as a spoiler). People who kill are generally not heroes and the movie takes that stand although Rodriguez does give his two lead actors true principles. In the end, it's a well-made film but sometimes, however, it's like trying to be Michael Jordan's son...in people's eyes, it's tough for the son to measure up to dad. So watch this and don't think Predator or Arnold.",Predators
219,Pingo-2,Nothing special...,5,7 October 2010,"We've seen humans being hunted by predators before. Many times. This is just one more movie showing the same thing. Sadly! PREDATORS could have been a great film. It has nice CGI (I love the spaceships and the planets!), good acting and nice filming and editing. Sound is OK, but nothing unique.However, the storyline and the locations are actually pretty boring. There's nothing new presented here, even AvP and its sequel are more interesting than this.The film is placed in some generic forests, not even jungles, and low camera hints of small and cheap sets and locations. The predator ""main camp"" looks like a small camp-fire setup that was built for $1000. The rest is, well, nothing special...Storywise we see much more interesting development in PREDATOR 2 (1990). The story could've used much more predator-character development, and almost tries, but looses it. Instead, the film goes for a generic (and extremely boring and unfit!) character ""twist"" in the end, which is just silly. (And the ""yakuza sword fight scene"" in the middle is even more misplaced - and boring).$45 Million in budget should show a better script than this.Sad - could've been so much better.

220,jake-179,Best Predator movie since Predator,10,17 July 2010,"This was great. A lot of people have been bashing this movie, but I liked it. The script is sparse and tight. I like the fact that they didn't waste a lot of time with set up or over explanation. The movie starts immediately and doesn't let up until the end. It is action packed, and moves at a steady pace through out the entire film. I think some people felt that some characters were killed off too quickly, but that is all part of the fun. It makes you wonder who might be next and again, doesn't waste any time getting to the action. I wish people were not so hard on sci fi movies when they come out. I love the genre, and I loved the original PREDATOR, so I want to see Hollywood come out with more movies like this one. PREDATORS succeeds were the PREDATOR 2 and the AVP movies failed. PREDATORS feels like a real, true sequel to the original Arnold classic.Of course, there is the criticism of Adrien Brody being cast in the lead role that I feel I must address. Brody did the best job he possibly could, and actually did much better than I thought he would, (he did the whole BATMAN voice through the movie to butch up a bit). I liked his character a lot. I am not talking about the actor, but the way his character was written. I would like to see more of that character, but in my opinion it would have been great to see a different actor in that role. I truly think Vin Diesel would have been a perfect choice and I think Nimrod missed a great opportunity by not casting him in the role. Nimrod commented that he didn't want a ""Arnold Type"" like Vin because he would be attacked for doing so. I understand that they wanted to go in a different direction with the casting, so I think a great choice would have been Ryan Reynolds. Ryan has already proved that he can carry the burden of action star, he has a perfect action physique, and he is a great actor with an incredible knack for delivering his lines with just a touch of comedy. He would have been totally perfect for the role and it would have been great to see him taking on a role so dark.If you haven't seen it, you need to. Give it a chance, and remember this is a sequel to the original. The first movie, PREDATOR, is absolutely a classic and one of my all time favorite action movies. It definitely deserved a good sequel and it is great to see that they finally did the movie justice.",Predators
221,petit76,mind-twisting reboot,8,13 July 2010,"It is important to note that despite it's perspicuous title, Nimrod Antal's ""Predators"" is no reboot of its establishing material. It's a honest-to-goodness sequel to the first two Predators films; a long awaited one at that after a couple of detours into the realm of crossovers into the ""Alien"" universe. It does however represent a stylistic update and intriguing expansion of the franchise's filmic mythology that also spans Dark Horse Comics' graphic novels and its video games.However, if there ever were to be a more convincing statement of intent in relaunching this franchise, it would have been putting its marquee producer Robert Rodriguez to work in a film so suited to his aesthetics and stylistic idiosyncrasies. But Rodriquez's pick to helm this film almost proves to be reason enough to watch this given that Nimrod Antal is one of the most exciting directors around these days. Antal's direction has always coincided with his a strong sense of atmosphere and character development. With his fascinating debut, ""Kontroll"" and his cleverly constructed meta-slasher, ""Vacancy"" as well as with last year's taut action spectacle ""Armored"", Antal has shown himself to be an effective genre director in that he's both comfortable in affirming a particular genre as he is deconstructing it. And in ""Predators"", he infuses it with not just a showcase of tried and tested sci-fi ideals but also a discernible impression of a robust horror film.Antal keeps things moving along at an exhilarating pace by introducing a rag-tag team of mercenaries and criminals getting air-dropped into a highly tropical and vegetative alien planet tailored by the ruthless and single-minded Predator race as a game reserve for the insufficiently armed humans and other prey. Its mise-en-scene immediately hearkens back to the jungle warfare of the first ""Predator"". As the movie gods demand, the herd gets thinned as the race of alien hunters reveal themselves to be superior in both their technology and understanding of game theory. Kept alive by de facto leader, the preternaturally perspicacious Royce (Adrien Brody), the band of humans begin to formulate their plan of survival against the truly fearsome Predators and their formidable weaponry.Brody's presence seems almost folly at first – a gruff vocal inflection worthy of Christian Bale's in ""The Dark Knight"" underscores a predictably rote tough guy but to his credit, a good actor always manages to sell his act despite himself. Like his character, who sees no virtue in human connection but instead adopts a ranger-like approach to survival, Brody doesn't seem to create much chemistry with his cast mates in his relatively new role as action hero. The rest of its main supporting cast are split of into archetypes – Alice Braga is Isabelle, an Israeli soldier and its burgeoning conscience, Topher Grace plays Dr. Edwin, the geeky comic relief and notably, the talented Walter Goggins of TV's ""The Shield"" and ""Justified"" is the smarmy knife-wielding death-row convict, Stans. Also, rounding of the surviving humans is the reticent Yakuza gangster, Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien) and the relatively noble Chechnyan soldier, Nikolai (Oleg Taktarov).Antal manages this character list well enough. As the chase progresses, you get a distinct feel of each human before they start to fall victim to their raison d'être. Besides a late flurry of actual and conspicuous violence, ""Predators"" actually fares better in its early scenes where the humans explore their predicament and the film plays the suspense card remarkably well. There's an actual interest in finding out the psyches of these mysterious humans who are hunters and monsters on Earth but scurrying mice on the Predator's turf.If anything else, the script provides little genuine surprises in it storytelling. Given its inherent similarities, the film bares a stunning amount of resemblance to last year's terrific ""Pandorum"" – where a space crew wakes up with no memory onboard a vessel designed as a Noah's Ark of sorts to vicious creatures hunting them. There's a scene with Laurence Fishburne as the planet's loony veteran survivor that cribs more than just mood but actual dialogue from the superior film.""Predators"" doesn't change the game too much but as far as delivering a solid and experience to its fanbase, it releases itself from the shackles of relying on crossovers and re-establishes the Predator as one of Hollywood's most fertile sources of sci-fi villains.

Seriously those movies take everything which was great about Predator 1 and 2 and flushes it straight down the toilet.
There's barely any gore, no memorable characters or dialogue and it feels like they are made for kids. I'm shocked there wasn't a Saturday morning cartoon based on the AVP movies, they're that dumbed down, it's like watching an episode of Power Rangers.Predators takes the franchise back to it's gritty action roots, this is definitely a movie aimed at adults and i was so hyped at the time to find out Robert Rodriguez was involved.
The movie has an interesting premise which i wish was explored in more detail but the action is really well done, the special effects are mostly great with the Predators looking as awesome as ever and there's some really gross (Awesome) gory effects. Adrian Brody also plays a pretty convincing tough guy which was something which threw me off guard.The movie also has a pretty dark mean streak which i like a lot. There's no heroes in Predators, just people trying to survive.

In this movie the budget is all grown up and it really shows. They have brand name actors and it's improved the overall feel of the movie while still keeping true to the original. I have seen one or two reviewers complain about how this movie is too much like the first two. I have to disagree. The entire Predator franchise is based on this ""mean alien big game hunter"" idea, and what do big game hunters do? They hunt big game. This movie fits the bill perfectly.This film reminded me of the story...The Most Dangerous Game by Richard Connell except this is a scifi and there are more hunters and hunted.I enjoyed every minute of it and I hope they follow it up.Predator fans will love this movie, it's a real treat. Like having another Alien sequel except it's good. The last two ""Alien"" movies were not very good.

225,RoboRabbit89,Weakest in the series. Not as good as the first two but great in concept.,5,4 October 2018,"This film has a nice concept for a third go around in 
the series. 
Now in my opinion this is the weakest in
the series, for two reasons; first, this is just a repeat of
the first film, just on another planet and second; it doesn't
add much character development or really expand any futher
on the universe or takes any risks of any kind.The story starts off in free fall, we meet Royce (Adrian Brody) a mercenary
falling unconscious but suddenly wakes up and actives a button on his
harness to release his parachute he lands roughly but safely as he falls through the tress and hits the ground. We meet other characters who are military or ruthless killers from different parts of the world.
It doesn't take long for them to realize that they are not on earth and
that they are the prey! They go up against three highly aggressive Predators
that have on code of honor and do not kill for sport, they kill for pure fun! To be honest this could have been better and I wanted more from
the characters and story, but it's just a meat and potatoes type of story.
I felt the characters were very shallow which made me not care for them as much, even though the actors are good their characters are shallow. 
Laurence Fishburne is probably the stand out, he plays Nolan a scavenger
who sort of ""helps"" the band of killers to shelter and tells them who and
what their up against. Although his part is sort of wasted his not in the film
for very long, he's in and out, their lots of missed opportunities in this, which
is sad.Overall, I still liked it, and i think it's still a decent edition to the series.

226,montera_iulian,"Predators does not succeed to attract you, to create it's own personality, to be original or keep you interested of what's going on on the screen",6,10 July 2010,"In a slow and deceitful year, Predators seemed to be a ray of light in Hollywood productions, Robert Rodriguez, the creator of Desperado or Sin City seeming to be the right man for the right franchise. Wrong! ... Predators it's not a bad movie but either is a good one, not even for the hardest fans of the franchise out there. It's pity that Rodriguez fails to bring to the screen that ""something"" that would get me excited through a Predator movie. The movie is rushed up, chaotic, all things coming together in like the first 15-20 minutes. Royce, the mercenary played by Adrien Brody wakes up, within' an unknown conjuncture, ""left"" in some unknown place: an abundant forest, tall and more imposing than an amazonian jungle. Things get together as soon as possible. Royce immediately meets other people, who arrived in the jungle in similar conditions, each one of them having a different occupation and being one of the best in their fields. The story looks interesting at one point till Rodriguez gives you a big ""get your mind dumbed down"" and jumps from the introduction to the actual action than it goes back to like 30 minutes of talking and then right to the end of the movie. The introduction for this movie, for the story and characters is silly and thrown in without a sense, the movie loosing it's main ingredient on which the first movie built fan-bases: building of suspense. Besides that, Rodriguez even if he said this movie is not a remake, he took all the elements from the first movie and inserted them in this one. Important elements like full dialogues, full action-scenes or full ways to dispose of those Predators. On short, the story is not original, does not have a strong build-up, no climax, no suspense and no mysterious atmosphere. Everything is wrapped in tinfoil, but the gasps and holes in the script I think I could have seen them from 4 theater-halls away. Not even one character you will remember after seeing this movie, just because his actions are mostly taken from the first movie, nothing being original and not to mention that the character development it's very very VERY poor. You certainly won't remember Hanzo instead of Billy even though they are the same characters at base. The only guy who deserves being mentioned would be Noland played by Lawrence Fishburne. He is the only character that got out from the movie's pattern, Adrien Brody not being able to integrate himself in his role, creating an naive, rushed image and childish of the main character. But let's put away the weak plot and weak dialogue and let's talk about the technical execution.I was just waiting to spread out my personal antipathy on the technical video execution of this movie.1. You do not use shaky-cams when you you're not sure you could pull it off because you'll do just a mess. The kind of a mess Public Enemies did and people bashed it for. 2. You don't use inefficiently close-captioned shots, edited chaotic thinking that the audience will be impressed by the confusion created in the movie. 3. You don't use real time cameras on a green screen when you don't know how to do your job right. Many times in this movie you could've seen the green screen behind the actors which is pathetic for a 2010 movie. 4. You don't create bad visual effects for a Predators movie. Take a look at machine-guns in open fire and those big explosions not to mentions those ""predator dogs"".Despite all these 4 important mistakes, cinematography would be one of the few positive things in this movie along with the soundtrack which was classic but poor used in many times (or it was used good but the movie lacked the suspense?). What can I say. The movie is pretty much a mess. You throw everything on a plate and serve them hot to the audience. This is better than that wack movie AVP2 but still it can't even touch the level of AVP not to mention as a Predator movie it's the weakest.Predators does not succeed to attract you, to create it's own personality, to be original or keep you interested of what's going on on the screen even though as pure entertainment your money won't be totally lost since there's some action that you would enjoy.Another 2010 movie which is disappointing.

227,the_rattlesnake25,"Ironically, its depth is its flaw.",6,14 July 2010,"Before you go to see 'Predators,' one thing you must remember is that in this reconstructed universe, the awful 'Alien vs Predator' films and the equally as bemusing 'Predator 2' (set in downtown Los Angeles of all places) does not exist. Producer Robert Rodriguez and director Nimrod Antal ('Kontroll', 'Vacancy') have decided to cut out the below-par spin-offs and sequel and give the original 1987 film a commendable follow-on, which fans of the original will no doubt enjoy. Yet, the irony comes in the form that despite Antal attempting to provide depth to the series, it only serves to detract from the films actual purpose – to show the visual representation of humans and alien beings taking part in explosive action sequences.All of a sudden there was a light, as eight human beings land in the middle of a game preserve, disorientated, annoyed and becoming increasingly agitated, they soon find that their day's going to get just that little bit more stressful as they realise that they're the hunted, not the hunters. And those committed to the act of hunting the hunted, are an evolved race of aliens simply known as the Predators, whose primary abilities revolve around their advanced alien technology providing dangerously vicious weapons and heavily protective armour, essentially rendering them as almost perfect killing machines. But this isn't nearly two hours of watching humans being stalked before their spinal cordz becomes part of a trophy exhibit, as those chosen to be part of this game are all hardened killers and criminals. The mysterious Royce, played by a brilliant Adrian Brody, is a US Special Forces soldier who takes centre stage as the no-nonsense taking, cliché-speaking loner who only has one goal; to get away from their current location. While IDF sniper Isabelle (Alice Braga) is the yin to Royce's yang, as she constantly refuses to put her morals and ethics aside when it comes to the tough decisions, creating a stage of tension outside the confines of the confrontation with the alien beings. Alongside Royce is an Russian soldier (Oleg Taktarov), a Mexican enforcer (Danny Trejo), a US Death Row inmate (Walton Gobbins), a RUF officer (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali), a Yakuza member (Louis Changchien), and the seemingly odd-one-out in an American doctor called Edwin (Topher Grace).While 'Predators' is beautifully shot by cinematographer Gyula Pados, and contains a well-written script filled to the rim with plenty of grin-silently-to-yourself-one-liners, it's fatal flaw is reminiscent in the fact that Antal is torn between creating a film in the same sci-fi action-packed vein as the original 'Predator' film, and one that contains the visual flair and character development which is more apt to film that may act as the beginning to a trilogy or further motion pictures. Because of this, instead of concentrating upon the actual battle between the two sets of predators, the film is more concerned with developing a back-story and plot which just isn't visible nor is it viable. The screen time of the actual alien beings pales in comparison to sequences of the eight hardened criminals trudging through overgrown shrubbery as they constantly try to gain their bearings, and this detracts away from the giddy, enjoyable nature of the original film. Aside from this however as mentioned, the performances are on-form, the is script short, but sharp and witty, and the shooting and subsequent editing create a competent and worthy sequel to the John McTiernan's 1987 original 'Predator' film.",Predators
228,Exiled_Universe,BEST PREDATOR MOVIE AS OF NOW!!! VERY AWESOME!!!,8,10 June 2019,"This movie is 100% the best movie in the franchise as of now. The movie was predictable at times but also unexpected at times and thats what makes this movie a masterpiece. Its was more better and action packed than the first two and thats because this is newer than those old ones and also this movie introduces new creatures and new predators that look badass. The cast was incredible and a good choice with some popular actors. I would not have a problem watching this again in the future. This is the perfect mix of action and horror. The special effects and CGI weren't the best but extremely better than how they were in the first two and they're not to the point where they're cringeworthy. Please give it a watch, it will be worth your while.",Predators
229,badoli,This is supposedly the best sequel to the first predator?! Then the license is sure dead.,2,10 July 2010,"Lets start with the good: There are a lot of good ideas in the movie. And that's it. All those ideas are wasted or worked out very badly.First the characters: I've seldom seen so badly designed ones! None of their actions made any sense. They are supposedly all bad ass soldier guys, yet they act like a troop of amateurs. The sniper girl wouldn't live a week in a real war environment! The relations between the people are never really explained. Why they stick together? No one knows. Why is everybody following the Brody guy? No one knows. I didn't feel any sympathy for anyone in this movie. The dialogs are painfully stupid, the whole script seems to just tries to find excuses to fill the time between action scenes. Every ""Lost""-episode has more suspense than this mess. Furthermore it's full of clichés.The longer the movie lasts, the worse it becomes. I had two beers before and even that couldn't damp the insanity. Finally i had to leave because it wasn't bearable anymore, i felt personally offended by this film.",Predators

None of the actors are anywhere believeable as the super-elite soldiers they are portraying. The moment Laurence Fishburne appears, the movie takes such an utter nosedive from the already low level, i had enough and left the moviehall. I didn't even see a predator.With ""Aliens"" and ""Predator"" there are two movies before this one which showed brilliantly how to do a ""Supersoldiers versus Aliens""-story correctly, so it boggles my mind how such a piece of garbage isn't even taking the slightest inspiration.Hollywood cashgrab at its worst.",Predators
231,Legendary_Badass,"An unnecessary, scene-lifting, ""homage"" laden letdown",4,10 July 2010,"Predators is not the typical reboot that asks fans to forget about previous entries, it goes the extra yard by actively working to destroy its predecessors' legacy. So, how does it manage to do this?Directed by Nimród Antal, Predators throws a group of elite soldiers into a mysterious jungle. Leading the pack are Adrien Brody and Alice Braga as experienced soldiers. The rest of the gang (introducing yourself by name isn't popular with this crowd) comprises of mob enforcers, psychopaths, and worse. Each parachute into an unfamiliar jungle, learn to trust each other, and find that they are farther from home than originally thought. Not only are they on a distant planet, but they are part of a hunting preserve stocked by honor bound extraterrestrials.Predators is strewn with references to the original '87 film Predator, so it is fitting to further the comparison. The original film served up two motifs: raw masculinity, and nature trumping technology. The casting of Predators is too gender neutral too evoke the original's message. The average member of Dutch's team would wipe the floor with the best offered here. Adrien Brody and Alice Braga are not terrible actors, but this series is not a place or genre they should be calling home. Characters in Predators have no history outside of this situation. We never see their ""normal"" lives, and this takes a dimension away from them because we cannot see how the hunt has changed them. At least the original film had a scene introducing the team to the jungle. Starting a movie with such a simplistic plot in the middle of the perceived story is a screen writing no-no. As presented the characters go well over twenty minutes oblivious to everything the audience knows at the point of ticket purchase. We know the mentality of the alien creatures, we know these people are on a distant planet, we know they are being hunted—having at least one human character privy to this knowledge would have shaved dead weight. Regardless, you see the redundancy of the Predator franchise and why there has only been one film that people care to talk about.I struggle to find an original thought in Predators. Again, the '87 original is a template for what to do next. Need to get characters to safety? Well there's a waterfall for them to slide over. Music? Just lift the original tracks and periodically add some rock elements. Can't write a line? Take your pick from the now famous memes generated by Arnold Schwarzenegger. When a situation can't be fixed with a Predator reference, it gets even more predictable with bullets magically not killing living creatures, heel turns, and the obvious going unnoticed. To its credit, the action is easy to perceive and the atmosphere appears related to the franchise, even if the infamous POV ""heat vision"" is not in HD.My initial impression was that the change in creature design signaled a reboot, but I'm ultimately baffled since the change is more of an introduction. If it's not broke, don't fix it. No one was complaining about the initial creature and there was no kernel of evidence to suggest that the original Predator needed to be one-upped. In Aliens, the discovery of a colossal queen makes sense because the original film's creature had a dynamic lifecycle that took center stage. From what I've seen of the Predator creatures across several films (I've forgone viewing Aliens vs Predator – Requiem), there has been zero evidence to suggest that the familiar Predator is an inferior creature among its own family. This implication is strong enough to negate the grandiose drama of previous films. Schwarzenegger's epic struggle with Predator Classic® is such a downer when all this time he could've fought New Predator® —but only if you allow history to be rewritten. Had there not been such a heavy handed effort to nod at the original, there would be no gripe; fans could write this off as a different take on the franchise. Instead Predators is an unnecessary, scene-lifting, ""homage"" laden letdown with its only contribution being an effort to lower the bar placed before it.",Predators
232,MWNiese,"Unimaginative, Lazy Writing",4,12 November 2011,"****Four Out of Ten Stars****What can be said here? So much potential squandered on lazy writing. And a $40,000,000 budget to boot! Wow! And this is the best Fox could come up with? Writers Alex Litvak and Michael Finch sh-lop together a story about human predators somehow abducted from Earth and somehow air lifted to an unknown planet so the Predator species can hunt them for sport. Yeah, nothing really original or interesting about that. The concept is just plain lazy, but perhaps they were rushed into writing this crap. Don't forget the addition of a secondary race of Super-Predators, who have much larger sex organs than the original Predators; well sort of. Anyway, the story board wastes it's time on the miscast leads, actors Adrien Brody and Alice Braga, who both phone in their performances and are completely miscast. Meanwhile, the most interesting characters, played by actors Louis Ozawa Changchien, Laurence Fishburne, Danny Trejo, and Oleg Taktarov, are almost ignored and disposed of much much too soon; it's a disgrace these four characters were wasted. Regardless, it's not as if the original ""Predator"" was anything noble. So how could we expect much more than mediocrity from a film such as this?",Predators
233,movedout,Not a radical departure from expectations but a solid sci-fi actioner,6,6 July 2010,"It is important to note that despite it's perspicuous title, Nimrod Antal's ""Predators"" is no reboot of its establishing material. It's a honest-to-goodness sequel to the first two Predators films; a long awaited one at that after a couple of detours into the realm of crossovers into the ""Alien"" universe. It does however represent a stylistic update and intriguing expansion of the franchise's filmic mythology that also spans Dark Horse Comics' graphic novels and its video games.However, if there ever were to be a more convincing statement of intent in relaunching this franchise, it would have been putting its marquee producer Robert Rodriguez to work in a film so suited to his aesthetics and stylistic idiosyncrasies. But Rodriquez's pick to helm this film almost proves to be reason enough to watch this given that Nimrod Antal is one of the most exciting directors around these days. Antal's direction has always coincided with his a strong sense of atmosphere and character development. With his fascinating debut, ""Kontroll"" and his cleverly constructed meta-slasher, ""Vacancy"" as well as with last year's taut action spectacle ""Armored"", Antal has shown himself to be an effective genre director in that he's both comfortable in affirming a particular genre as he is deconstructing it. And in ""Predators"", he infuses it with not just a showcase of tried and tested sci-fi ideals but also a discernible impression of a robust horror film.Antal keeps things moving along at an exhilarating pace by introducing a rag-tag team of mercenaries and criminals getting air-dropped into a highly tropical and vegetative alien planet tailored by the ruthless and single-minded Predator race as a game reserve for the insufficiently armed humans and other prey. Its mise-en-scene immediately hearkens back to the jungle warfare of the first ""Predator"". As the movie gods demand, the herd gets thinned as the race of alien hunters reveal themselves to be superior in both their technology and understanding of game theory. Kept alive by de facto leader, the preternaturally perspicacious Royce (Adrien Brody), the band of humans begin to formulate their plan of survival against the truly fearsome Predators and their formidable weaponry.Brody's presence seems almost folly at first – a gruff vocal inflection worthy of Christian Bale's in ""The Dark Knight"" underscores a predictably rote tough guy but to his credit, a good actor always manages to sell his act despite himself. Like his character, who sees no virtue in human connection but instead adopts a ranger-like approach to survival, Brody doesn't seem to create much chemistry with his cast mates in his relatively new role as action hero. The rest of its main supporting cast are split of into archetypes – Alice Braga is Isabelle, an Israeli soldier and its burgeoning conscience, Topher Grace plays Dr. Edwin, the geeky comic relief and notably, the talented Walter Goggins of TV's ""The Shield"" and ""Justified"" is the smarmy knife-wielding death-row convict, Stans. Also, rounding of the surviving humans is the reticent Yakuza gangster, Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien) and the relatively noble Chechnyan soldier, Nikolai (Oleg Taktarov).Antal manages this character list well enough. As the chase progresses, you get a distinct feel of each human before they start to fall victim to their raison d'être. Besides a late flurry of actual and conspicuous violence, ""Predators"" actually fares better in its early scenes where the humans explore their predicament and the film plays the suspense card remarkably well. There's an actual interest in finding out the psyches of these mysterious humans who are hunters and monsters on Earth but scurrying mice on the Predator's turf.If anything else, the script provides little genuine surprises in it storytelling. Given its inherent similarities, the film bares a stunning amount of resemblance to last year's terrific ""Pandorum"" – where a space crew wakes up with no memory onboard a vessel designed as a Noah's Ark of sorts to vicious creatures hunting them. There's a scene with Laurence Fishburne as the planet's loony veteran survivor that cribs more than just mood but actual dialogue from the superior film.""Predators"" doesn't change the game too much but as far as delivering a solid and experience to its fanbase, it releases itself from the shackles of relying on crossovers and re-establishes the Predator as one of Hollywood's most fertile sources of sci-fi villains.",Predators
234,fritzlang,decent horror flick,6,9 July 2010,"Just came out of the Friday/opening night showing.. place was pretty packed.The good: It was decent, had some nice scares, good visual effects, and the characters while never really being 3 dimensional, were more than 2 dimensional, and the acting was pretty good. And Fishburne was hysterical.Also, there was a real nice touch of humor. Many laughs (all intentional) - I never thought the f-bomb would be so funny! The bad: It was decent. That's all. Not bad.. Not very good. Just decent. It could have been so much better.The pacing was slow.. I can't even call this an action flick. While I can't say I was every really bored (though my wife was at times), the film never had me gripped by any action scenes. The film just kind of nicely rolled along.The film was pretty consistent (no major plot holes) except for one character (won't spoil who) who at the end just didn't ring true to me. If you see the film then you will know who I am talking about.Two minor quibbles...1) the opening titles were the lamest I have EVER scene. The word PREDATORS shows for about 4 seconds and disappears. That's it. Not that a title sequence really can make or break a movie, but they put absolute no thought into this one.2) What is with playing the Little Richard song at the end? People just laughed.. What was THAT about? made absolutely no sense to me.In summary, a fun little film. Just don't go expecting much.In retrospect, I don't think this is worth seeing in theaters. It cost $19 for me and my wife to see this (not counting child care). This is something that I would wait to go on sale used at my local blockbuster for $5.

236,Yiannis_Galidakis,The weird morality of the predator,9,29 September 2020,"Probably the best of all sequels of Predator movies. An interesting take on additional clues about the morality of this species: No sentimental ""friendships"" for other warriors like in the Alien/Predator sequels. No more information about high tech apparatus to be utilized by military geniuses like in the latest The Predator. Only given is that they fight between themselves, too and only care about singling out the ones who can survive the mess they are in, regardless of circumstances or genetic predisposition. Interesting that a character like Brody - skinny and phenomenally weak was chosen to portray this role. Some interesting science ideas, too: The place the survivors were thrown onto, looks like one of the satellites of Jupiter (in the sky when they were looking above at the clearing), like Europa or Io. I am not sure if such a satellite would have similar gravity to Earth though, or if there, the Sun remains stationary in the sky throughout the day, like the movie implies. Also, I am pretty sure the biggest satellites of Jupiter don't support plant life, but let's not be very technical, anyway. Colorful array of characters with different moralities make for an interesting addition to the crude, relentless and absolutely brutal morality of the hunters: Sorting it out between ourselves on who deserves to survive, before they get involved. Too bad Brody relegates an unexpected message to them: That we are no better than they are, in the worst case. So our morality is only for appearances, afterall. if you haven't seen any Predator movies, watch the first one (Predator 1987) and then this.",Predators

Here total strangers including Adrien Brody, Danny Trejo and Mahershala Ali to name a few are parachuted into this unknown jungle where they soon find that they are the game and being hunted by these powerful predators.I thought Brody did a great job in the lead and really played against who you would expect in the role. He also brings his best Clint Eastwood voice. Great music by John Debney, but really it is just a reworking of Alan Silvestri's great score for the original. Also starring Laurence Fishburne.If you are this deep into the series and have enjoyed them so far, give this installment a viewing.

There all equipped with weapons accept a few who's a prisoner and someone claiming to be a doctor. They soon find out they all experienced the same thing when being put onto this island and think they were placed their for a purpose. They start to realize that this is an alien planet full of ""predators"" that are there to hunt them. As in most movies they all get killed one by one until there are only a few left. The movie has some really good action sequences and is moderately entertaining. The twist in the end with the doctor being a serial killer was unnecessary and brought nothing to the overall movie. Also there was absolutely no character development but in a movie like this it's to be expected. The movie takes some cues from the original such as with the machine gun and when Adrien Brody takes off his shirt covered in mud. Overall a decent action movie this summer",Predators

Much was expected from Nimrod Antal Third installment, with Robert Rodriguez at its helm. Does it come at par with the expectations? I will say, to maximum extent...Yes.Cast-wise, a very good ensemble cast. Adrien Brody is surprisingly very good in the lead role. Much was said about his casting being a miscast, but I believe his performance, especially his husky voice greatly suited the role he portrays. Others were very good, with the exception of Topher Grace and Lawrence Fishburne, both of whom didn't excite much playing the ""other"" bad guys.""Predators"" strength is its haunting set, tension, action sequence, formidable casting and background score. The forests where the shooting takes place is amazingly cool and haunting. The action scenes were very stylishly choreographed with fierce gun battle, sword fighting, and hand-to-hand combat. The background score is uber cool and compliments very well with the tension throughout the movie.Overall, ""Predators"" is a very good action film. It's a Leave-Your-Brain-Behind-And-Enjoy kind of movie. The movie has certain unexplained facts concerning the settings of the movie like (1) Who were organizing these ""Games"" between Human & Predators, (2) For what purpose was it being held, (3) Was there some sort of collaboration or deal between the people behind these ""Games"" & Predators, (4) Where did the character of Lawrence Fishburne get the Invisible Predators suit, (5) What was the purpose of the Research lab where the humans took comfort etc.From entertainment context, ""Predators"" achieves what it desired, but not in the intelligence point of view.My Verdict: 7/10",Predators

Was Vin Diesel busy? Because really, Arnie proved you don't need 'guud actin' to score a winner in this franchise. Perhaps that hints at the real problem here. This movie actually tries to 'act' and 'say something', and it fails, miserably, horribly, like a guy with his spine ripped out.Which brings me to another point. The violence is just silly. So over the top ridiculous, there for it's own sake. No reason this movie needed to be an 18-A, forcing all those teen boys to hang out at the doors asking strange men to be their father for the night. Really, so un-necessary!Then there's killing off the bad ass former hunt sole survivor in one (again, completely un-necessary gore explosion) shot.The only part of this movie worth watching is the yakuza slash samurai dude fight scene. It's over too quickly, it's lame, and for once, they IGNORE the gore in this scene, even though it's a bloody sword fight! But it IS the high point of the movie. Watch Kill Bill Vol. 1 the final sword fight in the snow, if you want to see poetry and sword fighting, a work of art really, but so NOT what this director is obviously capable of. The Japanese guy could be the best character in the group, but unfortunately he comes alive only 5 minutes before his death. Wouldn't want to upstage the completely pathetic leading man though.And what is with the lame-o serial killer??? Nobody thinks to try to figure out what kind of bad-ass he is?? The fact that they can't doesn't make anyone suspicious he might be a PSYCHO??? PA THET IC.This movie makes Alien vs Predator a stellar piece of cinematography. Too bad they filmed that movie in the dark and I can't see what the heck was going on! They say this movie was a good sequel to the original. Actually, what this movie was a HORRIFIC RIP-OFF of the original. The original was actually Good.

I thought Predator 2 was/is a good movie & I enjoyed both AVP's on a purely guilty pleasure level.Like an Ed Wood movie.

Then the trailers hit & the actors became known & things started to look up. Long story short Brody your a great actor but an action star...no way! The other actors you say?

Its like no one knew what made these creatures so awesome!!!! It was embarrassing. Also what made the human element so good was chemistry between the actors.That even if one or two were an a-hole you still were rooting for them. Not here.Everyone was either playing to type or mimicking a scene from a better movie & badly.Except Fishburne who I typically don't like.Here he loosens up & grabs my attention then is quickly dispatched & completely wasted.Hell I would have rather have seen a whole movie with just his character than the 8 duds wandering aimlessly across the screen lost in scenery dialogue & all around bad mojo that makes up this 106 minute train wreck.The good news is that unlike Alien where everything hinges on Ripley Predator can be reinvented or re-explored.

I have to say though that despite it being an effective and fun movie it wasn't quite on the level I wanted it to be.You see Predators is to Predator as Aliens was to Alien so I was expecting to see a far more action-packed turn of events than what we get. Like the original Predator, Predators opens slow, we slowly learn about the characters and what they are up against as they travel across a bleak jungle game preserve set up by an Elite branch of the Predators. Essentially the motley crew of humans are the monsters of our world, each one a killer, and they are pit against the monsters of the Predator race who have subjugated the normal Predators (like the ones from the original movie) The film is slow to start but there are a few jaw dropping moments, some great death scenes and a little bit of gore for good measure. Its solid and it is DEFINITELY a step in the right direction (away from those mediocre AVP movies). In the end though I was a little disappointed. The film has all the pieces of being great but it never reaches the next level. There are a few nods to the first film, lines recycled and iconic moments revisited but it does so without borrowing too heavily. They also recycled some of Silvestri's original score.The acting and script could have been a bit better and despite having plenty of time we don't really learn many details of the characters.

The quality of the writing, acting, cinematography and special effects are barely up to the level of a student film. It is astonishing to see an actor of Adrien Brody's quality embarrassing himself with such a weird, forced performance. I kept thinking, did he really speak like that on set, or did they have to go back and dub it in later? I hope they paid him a lot of money. (They must have paid it to somebody - it sure wasn't the writer.) Topher Grace's performance as the doctor is so bad you wonder if the editors accidentally cut in the takes where he was just deadpanning lines for the audio mixer to set levels on the microphone. I felt especially bad watching Walton Goggins laboring to perform his luridly written death row inmate, because he's proved on the FX series ""Justified"" to be capable of so much nuance and complexity.The overall quality of this movie is very similar to an episode of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles where most of the lights went out on set, but they decided to keep working to save money. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the IMDb rating of this movie of 7.6 is very fishy. I don't know if the studio is actually hiring college students to stay up all night casting big votes for their movie -- but if so, shouldn't that effort have gone into actually making the movie better in the first place, instead of into promoting the disaster of a film that they produced?",Predators
248,riteshshergill,Not as good as the original,5,7 August 2010,"Putting aside all the hype surrounding this movie, I like it but not as much as the first because of the following reasons: 1. Why was Adrien Brody growling his dialogues throughout the movie.2. Topher Grace with negative shades.. ahem.. he's also the comic relief by the way.. doesn't do much damage though does he..3. Movie was quite predictable in some places.. The thrills and chills never came.4. Some of the scenes could have been developed further into good action scenes but most of them had tame endings. For example, we never got to see what happened to Danny Trejo's character. One moment he's shooting down the weird dog creatures, the next moment he's appealing for help as part of a trap set by the predators for the remaining members of the group.5. The black guy gets killed next (no surprises there I guess).6. The part where the Russian guy gets one of the predators (won't tell you how) has already been done in so many movies before.7. Laurence Fishburne got wasted.. literally.8. Predictably the hero comes back for the girl.9. Initially, the movie takes too long to develop.Now the good parts..1. The casting was good, especially that of Adrien Brody considering he doesn't look the macho type. If only he hadn't growled so much to look macho.2. The setting (the hunting ground) - another planet.. interesting.. will make for a good sequel, if there are any.3. The introduction of two types of predators..4. They stuck to the original background score.5. They did not reinvent the wheel. I also like the fact that they acknowledged the prequel.. most sequels don't bother acknowledging the fact that there have been precedents..6. No time was wasted on histrionics.. just that the movie takes a little long initially to develop; after that though it is relatively fast paced.Treat this movie as the build up to the sequel. I am hoping that the sequel will explore new grounds.. maybe better tactics against the Predators.. bigger meaner predators.. a more sinister plot.. better character development.. The sequel ought to be pretty damn good. They've got a good thing going..Here's to the sequel..",Predators
249,MarcusJ13,Worthy of the name,7,13 July 2010,"Its been a while since we have had a decent film involving the scary 'Predator' creatures. On the showing of Alien vs Predator I hoped this would get back to what we always wanted rather than the crap we got in those two films. Thus I sat down to watch Predators with a decent level of optimism. The film centres on some of the most deadly Preds that Earth has to offer in the form of elite forces, a criminal on death row and so on. The difference here is they have been put on another planet rather than the famous extraterrestrials coming to Earth to hunt for sport. The film wastes no time in getting to the point as we are put into the alien planet straight away along with the humans.I liked the fact that the planet didn't look too other worldly because it would have made it difficult to relate to them if the surroundings they were in were too dissimilar from that of the Earth so that was a positive move. It gave us something a little different and ensured the plot always stayed with what it originally set out with. This isn't always a positive move but it turned out to be on this occasion. Onto the characters and the main strengths came from Topher Grace and Laurence Fishburne. Topher Grace playing the 'why am I here?' role fairly well, but Laurence Fishburne really did well in his role as the tortured soul stuck on the planet alone. He was just so creepy, amusing and intimidating at the same time and a brilliant casting choice quite frankly. Adrien Brody plays the lead role but he's sort of questionable at times. He just doesn't seem to have the imposing figure that someone leading an action film like this should. It almost seems like he is trying too hard with his husky voice basically trying to spell out how domineering his character is without really doing it naturally. That said he is still good really and didn't drag the film down he just couldn't play it in a natural sense although I didn't really expect him to. The predators themselves are just as scary as they are before and it doesn't waste time with shadows and darkness which is an extremely good move giving it a brilliant action feel. I am not going to lie it does drift towards the usual action clichés but its fine you knew they were coming surely? All in all Predators is a good action film that is very entertaining, the only problem it might have is that it isn't terribly memorable and may as time goes on just exist without being talked about a great deal. but you can't have it all. It is definitely the Predator film that was needed and I would highly recommend it for its well executed action scenes alone.",Predators
250,lekgolah,A great return to the series!,7,4 November 2010,"I had high expectations for Predators since I knew that producer, Robert Rodrigeuz was aware of how much fans despised the the AVP films and that he wanted to make the ""real"" sequel to Predator. Predator is a great action film, so how could the sequel live up to the original? They make the sequel its own; the film takes place on the predator's planet, the lead actor is not the macho hero of the 80s but instead rather reluctant and they create interesting characters. Adrien Brody may at first seemed like an unusual choice for the lead character but he is interesting to watch and brings something new to the film. After all, he is an Oscar winning actor and his journey into a new role is fun to watch. While the script is not Oscar worthy, it keeps the viewer in suspense and never takes the audience out of the film. The supporting cast are interesting and come with their own stories. They include a Russian soldier, a Yakuza member, a convict and a Black Ops sniper. While some have more screen time than others, they play off each other well and are interesting to watch.Being the sequel to Predator (and that other film, which I won't mention) action is expected and the film delivers. One of the first action scenes involves predator beasts charging at the characters and it is exciting to watch. This is the same for the rest of the action scenes that keep the audience entertained. While the first Predator film asked the what they were been hunted by, this time they are asking where are they, who is responsible and how are they going to get back home? In some ways I felt that this film was leading up to a sequel that will be bigger and better in every way, but unlike some of the slower episodes of Lost, you go with it because it is the journey that is important as the film is not treading water. Without spoiling anything, something happens halfway through the film, which reveals more but asks new questions as well. Predators is not perfect but it is enjoyable to watch and will keep you interested in seeing what happens next. The film delivers on what it promises and fans should not be disappointed.",Predators
251,m667,First Predator movie I've seen and really enjoyed it.,7,26 October 2020,I like how they were all in the jungle the whole time hunting the predators.

252,unemployedvirgin,It Was Good But Could Have Been Better,6,7 October 2010,"VERDICT: Pretty good film, had a few easily spotted flaws. Characters needed to be developed more, on the plus side - Not knowing the true nature of how or why their in this situation brought out the best in them all.GOOD STUFF: Adrien Brody (i'll say it again) is a rising star and proves himself once more in this picture. However, Lawrence Fishbourne steals the spotlight with his dark..dark character. Not the most original plot but still very enjoyable and mysterious.BAD STUFF: Half way through the film Mombasa just disappears, i know for a fact he wasn't killed by one of the predators, just gone. Which was a real flaw in the storyline because he was the only one out of the whole group that could actually ""sense"" the creature's presence. Bad continuity on the director's part. The predators themselves kind of looked female (wierd i know but read on and i'll try to explain). Unlike previous films they're more slender, smaller shoulders, bigger craniums and not the same hardcore looking freaks of nature - in my opinion at least. Topher Grace should honestly never play a ""villian like"" character. I mean this is the cowardly face of That '70s Show! He failed at being Eddie Brock in Spider-Man 3 and just isn't cut out for a ""bad guy"" role yet.OVERALL: Great sci-fi action, Lawrence Fishbourne plays his darkest maniacal character ever (which i honestly think stemmed from the events surrounding his daughter's career) Adrien Brody was a convincing protagonist. Fight scenes were cool, mixed views on this so i'll give it a 6",Predators
253,derek-a-charette100,"While intelligent creativity exists, you won't find it in this movie.",3,1 December 2019,"In typical fashion, another high budget action film that starts out strong but falls apart midway through, and intelligence becomes absurdity and unreality. It's not a good thing when I already know who the surviving characters will be within the first 5 minutes of the movie. While there were a few surprises in the plot, it was still far too predictable. Why can't they make an action movie that actually kills off the assumed surviving character(s) in the early stages of the movie? Is Hollywood too braindead to break the same old formula that action movies have been using for 40 years? I think they are! What a shame.",Predators
254,Matador07,Solid if uninspired,7,3 February 2011,"There a are a number of silly reviews in here about how this is the worst movie of all time and what an embarrassment to the Predator franchise and all kinds of other ridiculous rants that have very little to do with the mostly solid little scifi actioner that was Predators. That does not mean the movie was a classic or anything close, but it was clearly a solid genre piece, and frankly the first Alien or Predator movie in 20 years to not flat out embarrass itself and the underlying franchises.So what held it back from being more than just solid? Lack of ambition really. The creators made a smart move in transporting the action off Earth where they could bring some innovation to the table...but then you could see the lack of ambition and desire to play it close to the vest when they only added in one or two moments taking advantage of the setting. Then throughout the movie they manipulate scenes and dialogue to purposefully bring to mind classic scenes from the original, including the means of several characters deaths. And finally they just seemed reluctant to bring any true originality to the battles, the use of the Predaors' gadgets, to the death scenes, anything. It all played out in fairly standard fashion. Entertaining enough, but almost no ""that was neat"" moments. You didn't regret watching it, but I sincerely doubt there are going to be any moments or lines remembered from this one in 20+ years the way there was for the original.",Predators
255,alexandercappelli,Love letter to the original classic,8,10 November 2014,"Predators is an enjoyable action film littered with homages and references to the original, it's a treat to watch as a long-time fan of one of Schwarzeneggers best. From the setting, to the music, to the character archetypes, even lines of dialogue and set pieces, everything is presented as a love letter to Predator. ""Long Tall Sally"" by Little Richard plays over the ending credits, which is a nod to the famous helicopter scene at the beginning of Predator, this was a particularly nice touch and one of the less overt references. The film knows what the audience wants and it doesn't waste any time getting right in to the action. This new installment adds a few new features to the franchise however the original predator design is still featured here, which is another example of the film makers respect for the first film and an understanding of what the hardcore fan-base is here to see. At the end of the day this is a B grade action flick, but then so was John McTiernan's 1987 classic. The success comes from a certain degree of self awareness and fan service that is thoroughly enjoyable and reminiscent of the early 90's style of unapologetic goofy action.",Predators
256,eddie052010,Strong candidate for the worst thing to come out of the entire Predator canon.,2,22 April 2015,"The Predator film series has had many hits and misses during its existence, as for every good entry, one or two bad ones show up quickly in its wake. The original Predator was quite good and AVP was decent (although admittedly more as a guilty pleasure than anything else), but Predator 2 was a complete letdown and AVP: Requiem stunk as badly as cow manure. So how does this one fare? Well with its bad characters, rubbish storytelling, dreadful dialogue and abysmal action, pretty poorly actually.The story is that a group of deadly criminals on Earth (i.e. corrupt mercenaries, militia members, murderers) are abducted from Earth and placed onto the planet of the Predators during the species' hunting season. In order to survive, these various characters will have to unite and fight against the deadly threat that awaits them. The plot is one of the first problems you'll notice about the film, as it feels both utterly generic, tired and lazy, like this was some sort of crappy Predator fan-fiction rather than a new entry into the series. Sure it doesn't have the same pacing problems Predator 2 did (it doesn't take as long for the Predator to show up for instance), but it isn't very ambitious either, and is filled with plot holes (i.e. why did the Predators pick an serial killer for their hunt, considering that he is not as dangerous as the mercenary and assassin characters?). Needless to say, it is clear why this story and script had been left on a shelf for so long.Another big problem is the characters, as they're all two- dimensional at best, and at worst, they're essentially pointless deadmeat, only being there to increase the film's bodycount. It is a clear sign of poor character writing when the main characters' names aren't revealed until the last five minutes or so. On top of this, whenever the film has any good characters, they are killed off very quickly, leading you to question why they are even there.(Spoiler) This is mainly notable in Laurence Fishburne's character, as he seems to be an interesting examination on the isolation and madness someone can experience when being alone in a hostile environment like this, but is killed off swiftly.The acting is also very average, as while everyone is fine, that's all they are rather than great, and no-one stands out as a result. Adrian Brody is a big problem, as despite his efforts, he's not a competent action hero, and his attempts act tough come off as a weird mix of the ridiculous voice of Christian Bale's Batman and a little kid swearing trying to impress his older peers. I don't expect him to be Arnie (something Adrian even admitted to), but at the very least, they could have hired someone who least swear competently.Another major problem are the Predators themselves, as like Predator 2, the eponymous villain of the piece has little threat and screen time. Sure, it doesn't take as long for the Predators to be introduced like Predator 2, but for a film called Predators, there is sadly very little Predator action, as most of the run-time consists of the boring characters talking to one another, making the film feel slower than it actually is at points. On top of this, the Predators themselves aren't much of a threat, as they are killed off very easily, despite being in groups, compared to the first film whereby it was hard to kill one of the things. It isn't as insultingly useless as it was in Predator 2 (as even a average built cop could beat it by that point), but considering that there are more Predators in the film, you would expect them to be much more of a force to be reckoned with. The film also adds very little to the Predator mythos either, and the things it does add are staggeringly awful, mainly the new Predator dogs, which look like something out of the next Ice Age sequel, and a new type of Predator, whose mask is Power Rangers levels of camp and is killed as quickly as the other Predators. It doesn't help that the action is very poor, with hack Nimród Antal directing the action in a very lazy and generic manner, leading to many copy-and-paste action sequences that don't get the adrenaline going but rather put you to sleep. Casein point, the criminally wasted Predator vs. Samurai fight in the film, as it is slowly paced, tedious and ends a lot quicker than it should. The action scenes also lack any bite either, as due to their poor handling, lack of any true visceral violence (the fact that it was rated 15 in the UK as opposed to the earlier films' initial 18 rating is a testament to that) & the fact that you don't care about any of the characters make the action lack any sort of tension or threat whatsoever.It is also notable for the amount of Robert Rodriguez-isms (who wrote the story and produced the film) in the film, clearly showing that, despite different writers and directors, he's had his grubby mitts all over the film. Casual misogyny, creaky dialogue & constant (not to mention annoying) homages to the earlier films are main examples of this, but Rodriguez forgets (like fellow filmmaker Quentin Tarantino) that homages alone don't make a movie.And what a bad movie it is too, as due to the huge amount of problems in the film, it is an undercooked mess overall. Not only does it add another nail in the coffin for Rodriguez as a filmmaker, but it also does the same to a once-credible franchise that clearly needs new blood in order to survive. Hopefully the upcoming Shane Black-directed sequel will be better, but for now this is the massive waste of potential we're left with.",Predators
257,Mrbigham13,Better the second time around.,7,23 October 2020,"I saw this when it first came out and wasn't as impressed. Watching it again 10 years later I appreciate more about it.

It's got lots of interests and if you liked the original at all this is totally worth seeing. My favorite ""Predator"" sequel by far.",Predators
258,dukevega,Where's the Character?,6,25 July 2010,"Since I don't get trailers where I am, all I knew about this movie was that Robert Rodriguez was involved and Oscar winner Adrien Brody was the star.What sets this apart from its predecessors are two things: 1) unlike the previous 2 which were set on Earth, this one is set on another planet, ""one big game preserve"", as one of the characters put it; 2) rather than having characters who were professional soldiers or policemen, here a major of the characters are from the opposite side of the spectrum (criminals, death squad members and mercenaries). There are a couple of professional soldiers, who also seem to play the part of moral compass for the group, but everyone else has probably been on a wanted poster at some point.The movie opens strongly enough, with Adrien free falling through the alien sky, albeit unconscious. He wakes up and activates the chute the Predators thoughtfully gave him. He quickly links up with the other prey and they all quickly realize where they aren't and why they are there, and then off they go not only to survive, but to win.What I have learned in my studying of films is that a problem with a movie can be found in one (or more) of three areas: structure, plot and character. The film is structurally sound, with a solid beginning, middle and end, and the plot is as straightforward as you can get--survival. The problem therefore is with the characters.The problem is that they're all razor-thin, there is nothing for us to hold on to, no reason to root for them, and the efforts of the professional soldiers to play the soul of the movie are half-hearted at best. The only one of the prey who stood out was a nearly-silent Yakuza assassin who, upon his arrival on the planet, does not freak out but rather calmly takes off his shoes. No reason is given for this, but it was interesting enough for me to focus on him throughout.Aside from the paper-thin characters, this film is solid enough and has enough action and gunplay to recommend for a rental.",Predators
259,TheUnseenMovieLover,"An Entertaining, But Unextraordinary, Summer Flick",7,16 July 2010,"I really like the original Predator; it's suspenseful, exciting and surprisingly witty in its comic look at male masculinity. However, Predator 2 is a lacklustre sequel; it's over-the-top, stupid, and, by changing the setting to LA, it lacks the natural menace of the original's jungle setting. I'm not talking about the Alien vs. Predator films; I haven't seen them, and I don't intend to. Now here comes Predators, a reboot from Hungarian director Nimrod Antal and producer Robert Rodriguez.The plot's pretty simple. Eight people are dropped into the middle of a jungle. With the exception of doctor Edwin (Topher Grace), they're all hardened killers. They include American mercenary Royce (Adrien Brody), Israeli sniper Isabelle (Alice Braga) and Mexican gangster Cuchillo (Rodriguez regular Danny Trejo). They soon realise that they have been chosen as the prey for the inter-planetary reserve which they are stranded on, and find themselves being hunted by the titular aliens. They must work together in order to escape their grim fates, but, as Cuchillo succinctly puts it (in the trailer, that is), ""Does this look like a team-orientated group of individuals to you?"" No, it doesn't.So, what are the pros of Predators? This is one good-looking film. The production design and the camera-work are top-notch. The camera nicely alternates between claustrophobic (a sequence in the later stages of the film is set in a spaceship, and is all the more effective for the intimate tension) and vast, epic shots. When we see the width of the reserve, we genuinely wonder where the characters are going to run to and how they will escape. When the action comes, it's very satisfying, both in terms of the choreography and the visceral gore (the infamous spine-ripping moment from the original is kept in, and is just as brutal and unexpected). For me, the most memorable piece of action would have to be the sword fight between Yakuza gangster Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien) and a predator in the middle of a field of grass. This scene has a graceful intensity to it which surpasses everything else in the film. Credit goes to Antal, as he not only avoids the shaky-camera technique in his filming of the action sequences, but also brings a palpable sense of atmosphere to much of the film. Also, the score by John Debney is pitch-perfect.Whilst nearly all of the characters are hardened killers, I still became invested in their fates. Eyebrows were raised when Oscar winner Adrien Brody got the lead role. People, have faith. He is utterly convincing here as a man who would probably give up his own mother if it meant getting off this planet. His performance has similar deficiencies to Christian Bale's performance in Terminator: Salvation; whilst they perfectly display the inner workings of intense, hard-as-nails leaders, you want to see more to their characters than just that one note. Still, Brody makes a forceful lead. Alice Braga brings an appealing mixture of toughness and vulnerability to Isabelle; whilst she is a more than capable killer, she also has a conscience. It is nice that, whilst Isabelle is the most sympathetic character out of the bunch, she isn't just a damsel in distress. As death-row murderer Stans, Walton Goggins does a strong job with less-than-stellar material. He gets the two moments which are likely to induce groans amongst the audience, but he also gets arguably the most crowd-pleasing.But there are three actors who steal the show. Changchien doesn't get many lines, but he exudes an effortless cool and dignity as Hanzo. He expertly uses his face and body language to show his character's brain whirring away beneath his seemingly calm exterior. For me, this made Hanzo the most intriguing out of the characters. As Edwin, Topher Grace brings a nicely measured element of comic relief to the proceedings. Edwin is, compared to the killers around him, relatively normal, and Grace gets a lot of comic mileage out of the character's squirming awkwardness. Finally, in a role which some critics have viewed as pretty secretive, but is made clear in the trailers and casting lists, Laurence Fishburne AKA Morpheus appears halfway through the film as crazed survivor Noland. Fishburne is, as always, terrific, despite being burdened with a character who is only there to provide exposition for the other characters before being disposed of. Noland is completely off-the-rails, and Fishburne relishes the character's quiet, dangerous madness. The cast is more than just solid; they are excellent.The flaws? Despite Fishburne's brilliant performance and Noland's promising entrance, his character brings the film to an unnecessary halt. The pacing of Predators is pretty jumpy. When it's moving, it moves like a cheetah. When it stops for exposition and character development (which the arrival of Noland signifies for part of the film), you really notice the drop in energy. Secondly, there aren't enough ""wow"" moments here. There are some; the opening sequence, in which Royce wakes up in free fall over the jungle, is a stunning kick-off, whilst some of the gore and the sword fight sequence also qualify. But this too often plays like a homage to the original film, instead of going in new, unexpected directions. Some will retort, ""It's a summer movie! Just enjoy it!"" But, with Rodriguez producing, I expected something more. As well as this, the CGI looks pretty cheap and tacky. Predators is a solid, professionally made and well-acted B-movie. It is a definite improvement over Predator 2, largely because it returns to the jungle setting of the original and therefore regains some of the original's dread. However, Predators is firmly a meat-and-potatoes film. You have your meal and you are satisfied, but you still wish that you'd had something more (a bit like Oliver Twist). The ingredients are there, but with less spice than you'd expect. Predators is, to deliver a final punch to the gut, a burger compared to the bloody steak which was the original, and best, Predator.",Predators

It might be better than 'Predator 2' as I haven't watched that in a long time but remember not thinking that much of it when I was 12 so I would imagine I probably won't think any more of it now.'Predators' with the ""clever"" ""S"" on the end making it a plural as apposed to a numbered sequel which would be 'Predator 3' or 'Predator 5' depending on whether you count the god awful 'AVP' films as anything - still suffers from everything sequels suffer from.Mainly lack of originality. O.k. yes it's a sequel so it can't be as original as the original film is but it can still get by on adding it's own new original merits to the mythos can it not? Well....yeah, sorta. But instead - what we get is pretty much a carbon copy of the first film with many unnecessary 'copied' scenes! Example: so we're back to jungle settings now. Congrates to the film makers for that as the ""concrete jungle"" for Predator 2 just wasn't scary in the slightest. There's a bunch of soldiers/mercenaries/murderer/tough guys with personalities which resemble that of the tough guys in the original film who this time make their way through the jungle whilst the 'Predator/s' watch from the trees learning there movements and speech phrases also like in the original. A few action scenes; ""oh no! we're on another planet etc."" some running from aliens which consist of some giant predators for some reason. Now this is where the film makers really break into their own originality: instead of just ONE person falling down a water-fall - we'll have the WHOLE CAST fall down it instead!!!! O.k. I accept that. Moving on.Laurence fishburne's character is introduced into the film. Finally the film gets interesting. Fishburnes character is the best in the film. Sadly, we can say bye to Fishburne 15 minutes later and go back to running from all sorts of different colour/sized Predators who in this film don't seem to mind attacking un-armed individuals.So far - there has been zero suspense in the film and besides a few mediocre action sequences and some not-THAT-gory murders, the third act of the film is upon us.Now we can look forward to a ridiculous sword fighting sequence which was not even well shot or choreographed and looked like it was done in one take. It was just bad and completely irrelevant.Anyway, final act comes. Some plot ""twist"" thrown in to make things interesting. Brody and giant Predator face-off Arnie-styles, mud and all! Brody wins. Grabs the girl. ""Let's get the hell off this planet!"" hint at inevidable sequel happens. Little Richard sings us the credits. The end.'Predators' ultimate downfall is the typical Hollywood idea that ""Bigger is better""! Adding too many things and expanding on already existing themes makes the film too muddled and just silly in parts. It takes away from the suspense the film should have but loses due to too many changes and silly alterations made to the Predators themselves. There does not need to be more than one type of predator. Why do the big predators hunt the little ones??? Why do they all look different, we don't need to decipher between any of them - they have no personalities!Besides all my complaints, I did still enjoy the film. It's hard as a male not to enjoy pointless carnage at the hands of mutated alien man-hunters on another planet.It just lacks suspense and has a few too many ""Hollywood"" moments in it for my liking.Could have been better.

It is, however, such an improvement over the other dreadful sequels that it deserves merit simply for that. Adrien Brody is solid in an against type role, and carries himself well.

The action was seriously well done, with flashes of the visceral energy that this series desperately needed.

265,Stefan_Loves_Movies,"Who Is the Hunter, Who Is the Prey?",8,28 October 2021,"Predators (2010) uses a similar formula that worked in Predator (1987). Some aspects of it are better than the original movie, others worse. The movie starts strong, possibly one of the best openings! After 40 minutes into the film, I was thrilled and still fully invested! It has good build-up, mystery, suspense. The issue comes when the real action starts. Things get a bit confusing... Sometimes you are left wondering about the thought process behind some questionable decisions characters take.All in all, I think Predators (2010) is heavily underrated. It was a great movie with a witty story! Predators (2010) is a worthy sequel to Predator (1987)!",Predators
266,gsboy1000000,top original predator,9,27 April 2020,"Among all the predators this one stands out the most.
To me except for the first one of course which was a revolution (saw it at time square NY in 1985, and at the time when the predator skins the soldier I almost walked out, that was something never seen before in a movie), this scenario has an exceptional level of creativity originality and it is a super action pack with no flaws whatsoever. Great movie to watch re-watch over and over again.",Predators
267,zofos,The Thrill Of The Hunt Returns,6,16 July 2010,"Based on a script Robert Rodriguez wrote back in 1994, ""Predators"" finally makes it to the big screen 16 years later. It's also the first direct Predator sequel (without Aliens in it) since ""Predator 2"" in 1990, so it's good to see it back again like an old friend returning after a long absence.""Predators"" has an interesting premise. The Predator species are no longer content to travel all the way to earth to hunt random victims in hot zones of conflict (did Schwarzenegger's victory convince them that humans had an unfair home advantage on Earth?). Now, their hunts are premeditated; they stalk their human prey, kidnap them from Earth and parachute them onto their home planet so the games can begin on their terms and on their turf.The prey here is the usual multi-ethnic mix familiar from the original ""Predator"" movies and ""Alien."" We have the Hispanic female (Alice Braga from ""I Am Legend"") and the black mercenary, etc. We also get new types like a Japanese Yakuza gangster, a death row prisoner and a fighter from Chechnya no less. They do the usual squabbling/bonding as they try to figure out what the hell is going on.Laurence Fishburne shows up for an all-too-brief cameo (with ""Apocalypse Now"" references) as a nutty lone survivor of previous Predator hunts. He has an imaginary friend that he talks to all the time and Fishburne is clearly having a blast, but he is not in it long enough. Pity.There is a surprising amount of dialogue and Alan Silvestri's score lifted from the original ""Predator"" movie. They even pinch lines from James Cameron's Aliens.Adrien Brody was a surprise casting choice for the lead here; he's not the first guy you think of as an action hero being quite thin and lanky usually. At the end though, he does get to take his shirt off (revealing a surprisingly buff bod) to go mano-a-mano with the Predator. Credit the writers for not going with the usual Predator self-destruct finale. The end also has a twist and sets it up for a sequel nicely (Rodriguez apparently wrote enough material for three ""Predators"" movies back in the 90s).""Predators"" is a return to form for the Predator franchise after the sloppy ""Alien Vs Predator: Requiem"" and is a worthy addition to the genre. I hope there will be a sequel (how about Stallone's Expendables team going up against the Predators? That would be awesomehope you're reading this Fox!) There's life in the old beast yet!",Predators
268,ninjawaiter,"Holy Stupid, Batman!",1,23 September 2021,"There's so much wrong with this film it's hard to know where to begin, so I'll just start at the start. SPOILERS:1) That's not how parachutes work. Every character should have died on impact.2) Spetsnatz guy with a minigun can't hit 2 people at close range with 100% element of surprise.3) Adrian Brody's character goes from ""let's all work together"" to ""I'm better on my own"" in the course of about 5 minutes with no explanation for the change, then immediately reverts back to working together and rescuing others.4) US Special Forces guy (found dead) built magical traps that fire hundreds of sharpened stakes straight down into the ground from the open sky above over several score yards of terrain, dug 20ft deep 12ft across pit traps filled with spikes, and hoisted multiple gigantic fallen logs weighing several hundred pounds each high into the air. Seriously? How long did the Predators leave him alone and how strong is he?5) These trained and experienced warriors/soldiers approach the first parachute cage cautiously, guns up, looking out for a surprise or ambush, but somehow never lift their eyes beyond human head-height or look more than 10 feet past the cage to notice the other dozen cages and parachutes that are all in plain sight surrounding the first one.6) They're on an alien planet, but all the flora and fauna apparently belong to earth, because none of these experienced jungle warriors notices a single plant or critter that seems out of place. Even so, these experienced jungle warriors can't identify a single plant that suggests what continent they might be on. But wait, the doctor (not botanist) identifies a single exceptionally strange exotic plant, not bothering to mention to the rest of the group where that plant comes from (and no one bothers to ask), which would have told them what part of the world they were in. Yup, it's that kind of stupid.7) Adrian Brody correctly identifies that Topher Grace doesn't fit in with the rest of the group, but no one bothers to inquire any further than that. Obviously it's not important, right? Whoever put you here probably grabs one random noncombatant in every group, just for amusement.8) They could see the sky clearly while moving through the jungle, and could perceive the sun well enough that Adrian Brody could tell that it wasn't changing position at all even while he was in continuous motion, but somehow they couldn't see the gigantic planet hanging low overhead filling up 7/8ths of the skyline, or the various other planets plainly visible beyond it, until they got to a particular spot. Really, that's what they're going with.9) These ""elite warriors"" all waste absurd amounts of ammunition spraying the jungle in the general direction of charging alien dogs, hitting virtually nothing. When they do hit, the first alien soaks up scores of rounds before finally going down, only for subsequent beasts to be taken down but just a couple of hits. The elite Israeli sniper's gun jams and she is unable to clear the jam (apparently that's something she never trained for), and when she transitions to her pistol she slowly lays back on the ground in front of the advancing monster, putting herself in the most disadvantageous position possible for absolutely no reason. What is going on? At least they're consistent in showing that the Spetsnatz guy can't shoot ANYTHING with his minigun at close range, as he sprays the area around the demon dogs without hitting them just like he did around Adrian Brody earlier. Maybe he's an imposter who's never handled a gun before, and the Predators grabbed him by mistake. Maybe they ALL are? After wasting all that ammo, Adrian Brody suddenly starts worrying about ammunition. Oops.10) They hear Danny Trejo calling out for help, and spot him wounded and facing away from them sitting in the middle of a field. No one even tries to ask him what's wrong, even though they think it's a trap. Even once confirmed, no one calls out to ask his condition or what happened.11) Despite 2 people not having guns and one person already complaining that he doesn't have a gun (and pointing out that Danny Trejo had at least 2), no one thinks to look for Danny Trejo's guns after he dies.12) A closeup of Adrian Brody talking reveals the muzzle of his gun clearly plugged with mud and grass. Apparently this elite warrior shoved the barrel in the ground and didn't even know enough to clear it.13) None of these elite warriors knows they should spread out so a single grenade couldn't kill the entire team. Instead they move around in a bunch as if begging for death.14) In the Predator camp Spetsnatz fires his minigun angled so high the invisible Predators would have to stand on each other's shoulders to get shot in the head. At least they're consistent that this clown doesn't know how to use a gun. Adrian Brody goes back to his original plan of wasting as much ammunition as possible firing at nothing. Apparently that concern about ammo went the same route as his brief ""I'm better on my own.""15) The entire group manages to trip and tumble down the same hill and off a cliff into convenient water. No one is injured in any way, drowns, or even loses a piece of equipment. Impressive.16) The Israelis know about the Predators, but no one bothered to come up with a name for them. That must make writing reports about them or discussing them incredibly difficult.17) While planning how to fight the Predators, no one points out that even if they kill all of them, they'll still be stuck on an alien planet with no way home.18) The criminal literally talks about his life goals as ""doing cocaine"" and ""raping (female dog word)s."" That's his characterization. Good god this writing is awful.19) The elite sniper's rifle barely makes an inch deep hole in a tree, and the bark is peeled outward instead of pushed inward. It literally looks like someone carved the hole in the tree with a pocket knife. What happened to the effects budget for this shot?20) Laurence Fishburne somehow has Predator voice recordings of the original team from the 1980's, despite the Predator who recorded them having been alone and blown himself up. I guess they have intergalactic wi-fi and automatic cloud storage, which he was somehow able to access. Also, apparently that's the only recordings they have of humans, despite all the hunting.21) I guess we can assume Laurence Fishburne is crazy when he tells the team he could smell them since they arrived (across miles and miles of jungle), but it's still a completely bizarre line.22) Apparently the Predators forgot all about that whole ""hunting"" thing and matching enemies weapon for weapon when they finally found Laurence Fishburne, so they just shot him when he was armed with a bone axe. If he was the most successful prey they'd ever had, you'd think they'd be more interested in him as a proper hunt/trophy.23) Topher Grace manages to get lost following 2 feet behind the rest of the group, then goes shouting for attention when he knows he's being hunted. He also carries the shortest-burning flares ever invented. Standard road flares will burn for hours, but his last just a few seconds.24) Spetsnatz is still alive with a 4-inch diameter hole blown through the left center of his chest directly where his heart should be. Wow, he may not know how to use a gun, but apparently he's immortal. Even when he's completely impaled slightly lower on his chest (somehow missing both lungs?) and lifted off the ground BY THE IMPALMENT he's still capable of spitting, talking, and fighting.25) Sometimes the Predators' laser canons blow holes through things; other times they simply leave a nasty burn. Nothing indicates a difference in the type of shot fired, including the circumstances, since they shoot fleeing enemies in the back with both.26) The Yakuza just happens to find the only ancient weapon in the place, which is exactly the type of weapon he knows how to use. Then he pulls a Billy from the first film. But this time they show the fight, and apparently the Predators have become complete weaklings by now, so he actually wins. Wow, just wow.27) The survivors are discussing leaving behind a crippled Topher Grace, and STILL no one has asked why he got thrown in with this group of elite warriors and killers. It's like curiosity about life and death matters isn't a thing.28) Oh good, the alien ship has remote start! And intergalactic auto-pilot. That's extremely convenient!29) When Predators are fighting humans they're super agile and use all kinds of laser cannons and throwing weapons and spears and retractable claws and such, but when they fight each other they just hug and push, like two men stuck in oversized rubber suits that don't have much freedom of movement. Weird, huh?30) Wow, finally the ""big reveal"" for Topher Grace's character, and apparently he'd rather be hunted and killed by Predators than go home, because he's ""weird"" there. This might be the worst writing in history.31) Good thing Adrian Brody gave up his only chance to get home so he could come back for the others and they could all die together. Revenge is better than survival anyway, right? Besides, who would want to make it home in possession of an alien ship full of alien technology? That'd be just awful.32) Where did all those grenades come from that they used to trap Topher Grace's body? The group hasn't thrown a single grenade the entire film.33) Adrian Brody tries to use Arnold Schwarzenegger lines, and just sounds like a dork. Then he physically beats up one of the larger, more powerful Predators, because that's a thing you can do. Also, Arnold needed to completely coat himself in mud. Adrian Brody just puts on enough to look like he needs a bath, and obviously wouldn't have any effect. Well done effects department.Well that was a travesty. I hope everyone involved in this film is properly ashamed.",Predators
269,S_dot_M_dot,A Strong Outing,7,22 August 2021,"A group of the worlds deadliest warriors must band together when they are thrust into unknown territory and hunted by a superior life form. With an all-star cast including Adrien Brody, Lawrence Fishburne, Mahershala Ali, Walton Goggins, Danny Trejo, and Topher Grace, this is The Most Dangerous Game taken to the extreme.Right off the bat, Predators is a sequel involving one the greatest movie monsters of all time. KNB EFX did a fabulous job on the design of the new Predators for this outing. The cast also does a great job of carrying the basic plot to the finish line. They all work well with each other and have an organic camaraderie. The stunt work was top notch, especially a certain cliff dive.While many of the locations and set designs I enjoy, at times they don't seem to flow together but instead are just placed in a location. Some of the CGI can look cartoonish but other times is seem less. My biggest complaint of the film is some parts are way to dark for me. There is a particular fight scene I love but wish it was a bit brighter.This ranks high on my list of films in the Predator franchise. Taking a simple premise and including a fantastic cast and great creature design, this feature just flows so well. I would be on board if this premise is ever revisited again.",Predators
270,brownish33,One world: LAME.,1,21 April 2012,"just saw the film a few hours ago with that movie money i got with the bluray predator.the film itself is really stupid compared to the first (even offbeat second) brilliant film. like many here i actually think predator 2 felt more like a predator film then this did. at least that was original. there were so many homages to the first film in this one it started to feel like a remake and not a sequel. also none of the characters were likable and died off too quick to even care. those stupid looking CGI alien things were pointless and the new predators looked pretty retarded, even more then the AVP predators. and once again, a human siding with a predator? thats very hard to believe. i just couldn't buy little Adrian Brody taking on a predator in hand to hand combat. and like i said, the homages were one too many and some of them were so stupid like the Chinese guy taking out his sword like billy with the SAME music, and Laurence fishburne going ""over here over here, turn around turn around turn around"". it became almost laughable how many times they tried to reference the other movie. at least ATTEMPT to be original. just cuz the movie takes place on another planet while having every other scene reference the '87 movie doesn't mean that your being ""original"", just ripping off. the CGI for the predators while they were fighting, every time they hit the ground they glowed blue, that was so dumb and distracting. and Adrian Brody yelling ""im right here kill mee!"" basically copying Arnold with the mud and everything was so stupid!! and why was Laurence fishburne in this? he was in it for like only 5 minutes then gets blown up really fake like. also, playing ""long tall sally"" during the end credits makes NO SENSE AT ALL. yes, again, it was used in the original film as the guys were going to the jungle, but that made sense since they were just in a chopper listening to old-school rock. in this movie there is no such thing happening, so playing that song makes absolutely no sense in the context of this movie. it just serves as yet another homage (im getting tired of that word) to the first film but doesn't serve any point whatsoever.I went in hoping it would be something different, but Predator 2 was much better then this. this one felt like an extremely lame ripoff of the first movie. if your any kind of fan of the original, save yourself from this corny cringe-worthy remake, er, ""sequel"".",Predators
271,pulikd,This time there's more,7,5 July 2021,"This installment in the ""Predator"" film franchise takes place on a different planet. But neither air nor gravity conditions are any different, apparently. Of course, one cannot leave this planet without a spaceship, but there are places on Earth where you will die a horrible death if you lack the skills, the knowledge and the equipment. What is the point of placing the action on a whole different planet if that planet isn't much different than ours? And why is that forest basically empty of animal life? Has it all been exterminated by predators?There is a big piece of abandoned machinery where someone lives. Why do predators not check out that huge thing? There is a place where predators work with the corpses of their prey, and there is an unconscious predator strung up at some totem. Why is it there? There is a predator spaceship parked not far away from that site. Why is that ship there?Predators, apparently, use this forest planet for their hunt. They kidnap people and bring them here. And they do it a lot. Do they infiltrate human societies all around our planet? They have camouflage that makes them invisible, but really, how do they get someone from prison, for example?Nine individuals get dropped on the planet. One dies because his parachute didn't open. The others have to explore the environment. They don't know each other, they don't trust each other. They are all professional killers from different parts of the world. Two stand out.One is very experienced, intelligent, calm, careful, and tells you way less than he knows. He does not want any company, he is absolutely fine on his own, but he does not stop the rest from following him. He can benefit from having them around. Adrien Brody was great here. The fact that he is not a mountain of muscle, unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime, is not a problem at all. In fact, the more muscle and mass you have, the more care and nutrition you will want. And that is a disadvantage for a soldier in the jungle. Brody's physique is way more realistic. And what he does, as an actor, is simply brilliant. Whoever says he is a miscast does not understand what they are talking about. Adrien Brody is the strongest part of this movie.The other individual that stands out is an apparent doctor. When they find him, he is trapped in a tree and says he has no cutting tools on him. He later turns out to have a scalpel. And even later he turns out to be a murderer and a rapist. Through our main character, through Adrien Brody's Royce, this human masked monster will get his punishment. Too bad they didn't keep a little scene in the movie where Royce threatens him with a big knife and finds out this doctor is an addict whose addiction has cost one of his patients their life. They could have kept that handful of seconds in the movie.I loved every actor in this movie and apart from the two characters I've mentioned, I don't want to go into any more detail. They were all there for a reason, nobody was boring or annoying. Goggins, Taktarov, Braga, Trejo and the rest, they were all good.Since this is basically a jungle movie, or, to be more precise, a forest movie, it heavily relies on nostalgia. I have been a fan of the very first movie in this franchise quite simply for as long as I can remember. And every reference to 1987's ""Predator"" was very pleasant for me. But ""Predators"" does not have a team on a mission. Arnold Schwarzenegger's Dutch and his subordinates were like a family. They respected him and he regarded them as personalities, not disposable war machines. They trusted his leadership, he cared about them. ""Predators"" is different. This is a group of dangerous strangers thrown into one trouble where they have to figure out what to do and how to survive. They don't work as a team because they are a team, they do so because they do not have a choice.When Royce learns about the parked spaceship, he does some quick math. That creature strung up at the camp must know how to fly it because it is of the same species as these hunters. And it will do it to get help. I have seen this ""enemy of my enemy"" thing in ""AVP"" already. But it feels very fresh regardless. Royce frees that imprisoned predator, but they go their separate ways at once, they do not work together, unlike the situation in ""AVP"".Royce goes to the spaceship that our good predator activates from a distance using his gauntlet to get the right coordinates set. But he can't accompany Royce because the scariest of the three bad predators is here, the Berserker. And they fight. But the ship wasn't left on that spot by a fool. The Berserker uses his gauntlet to blow it up from a distance. Royce, thankfully, turned around and abandoned the space travel idea at the last moment. There is one reason that is obvious, clear as day. He could not leave a human being behind, no matter how hardened and selfish he may be. This reason we can all agree on. But I think there is something else. Something tells me Royce has enough common sense to suspect something is not right here. These sophisticated space hunters could not just leave a spaceship for their prey to steal with the help of a traitor from their own race. I think this is simple enough for an experienced man like Royce to figure out.So, what should be concluded here? The movie relies on nostalgia in a good way. It is familiar on the surface but different underneath. It combines practical effects and CGI in a beautiful way that I don't even think needs any comment. It simply is well done, thumbs up. Does it have shooting and fighting? It does, but as for the atmosphere that it creates during viewing, it is akin more to 1979's ""Alien"". Careful, step by step, methodical, hypnotically beautiful, that's what it is. Is the plot perfect? Of course, no, pretty much like every movie of this sort that I've seen. Is it an interesting story driven by character? Yes, it definitely is.",Predators
272,Vezon123,Long-awaited meeting with Predators,8,20 July 2010,"Yes, this promising, really intriguing novelty of a summer film season appeared in my imagination and it was represented to me as something great, grandiose, shaking and superinteresting. The given tape I waited personally not less than 2 years, therefore official trailers, тизеры and numerous preview trailers to a film have jammed literally to holes. Whether it is necessary to speak about quantity of viewings of the film with the same name «Predator» 1987 with Arnold Schwarzenegger and not less known second film with Denni Glover in leading roles. That, the tape Robert Rodriguez ""Predators"" could to me be looked in one of the first sessions of premier day. And, speaking to several words, it was indescribable!.So, here it, Adrian Broudi, Oleg Taktarov and Denni Treho in leading roles, here and all other command of mercenaries, soldiers, killers, mad murderers and other crowd which, according to a picture plot, will of a case or are more true, on wave инопланетной than race of predators, have appeared on another's planet to show, on what they are capable to be at war in the faultless art. Such, the interesting and fascinating beginning of a picture is not tightened too long — representatives of ""fighters"" about the planets the Earth armed unless not to the teeth, unite in компашку, yes start to wander on Aliens to jungle, collecting, so to say, adventures and troubles on the soft places. Amazing resource and ingenuity, keenness and ingenuity of character Broudi contrasts with simplicity, чудаковатостью and narrow-mindedness of other heroes. Though, as a whole, it was very interesting to see on the screen of representatives of the different nations and excellent from each other people on a mentality, actions and behaviour in critical and dangerous situations. In such situations, as, for example, fight with «manual пёсиками» predators, battle with hunters or even strikes of earth dwellers with each other.The picture and all that looks at us from that party of the screen, it involves all, interests, pleases and puzzles simultaneously, allowing to think also and of that, the film leaves how much good, can, or whether founders of a new picture about old-kind favourites of public — predators, most likely, could, to remove worthy, qualitative and meeting high requirements of the modern spectator, a film. With these thoughts I not without pleasure and pleasure looked at desperate struggle of earth dwellers and predators, here and there could not hide delight and surprise, the present happiness and sincere amazement, and as an example the scene in which there is Lawrence Fishbyorn dressed in clothes of the Predator can serve it. Or, say, prefinal struggle of Predators from different races (them, it appears, also it is a lot of), — new, earlier unprecedented spectator Predator (more terrible and installing animal horror), without effort wins ""kind"" and to all of us of well familiar Predator who was caused to help visitors from a planet the Earth. Nedetsky and rather severe struggle is untied as well between hero Broudi and the new representative of race of Predators, — the given part of a picture is the most impressing, and, perhaps, to the best in a film, devilishly pleasing an eye and remembered on long, long time. At least, so it seemed to me.So, in the course of viewing of a tape I could not tear off a sight from the screen and that every minute, every second, on it was created, I even was not dared to allow to think to myself about something other, distracted and not concerning the film. Events, actions, and episodes and pushed circulation of shots impressing and promptly replacing each other in the end of a film to shout «This tape is definitely worthy Oscar!» Or «a fine, amazing film, exclusively higher point!» Certainly, any person will find here much. Someone — an excellent fantasy and a magnificent action, someone will recollect former pictures ""Predator"" and «the Predator II», made boom in the film market in the end of 80-s'. Well, and it will be simply pleasant to other people to look the qualitative and original, unprecedented and perfectly removed fantastic tape which has been not deprived остросюжетности, comedy and lyrical digressions, and also possessing beauty ""external"" and ""internal"" — both an attractive picture, and substantial thoughts, themes, coherence of a plot, originality of idea and the scenario.Looking at the given tape from different directions, attractive both exclusively intriguing attention and a look of the spectator, it is possible to sum up following character: Robert Rodriguez ""predators"" of 2010 of release — rather skilfully stuck together and with love the made film for fans and admirers of old ""Predators"", and not only for them. It is a film surpassing in hundreds of time pity parodies on so great «the Predator I and II» in the person «Aliens vs Predator I and II», in practice appeared a fake and thousand which have rigidly deceived expectation and millions fans. The same picture applies for a masterpiece rank for both my expectations, and expectations of my friends about классичности and reconstructions of spirit, atmosphere of old films, in respect of domination of a plot and its development over «simply beautiful image and a picture», it has justified on all hundred. That, the tape has impressed me, has pleased, has surprised, has brought weight of pleasant surprises and has allocated still with the big bouquet of the impressions consisting of delight, sincere emotions and unforgettable sensations, therefore, undoubtedly, only P.S. The soundtrack of a picture and a song playing a final caption, without special work have rolled a wave of nostalgia and light grief, have allowed to recollect again and again to experience style, spirit and atmosphere of the very first and a film ""Predator"" of 1987",Predators
273,dellamorte-44869,Useless,3,9 September 2018,Sprinkled with a few good ideas but ultimately not worth the effort it's mostly derivative of the original PREDATOR. Extremely predictable,Predators
274,rockinkettles-1,Predators has its moments,7,12 July 2010,"Predators is a good action flick, but at times, it can sort of drag. The acting is very good. Better than most of these kind of films. Adrien Brody finds himself in the jungle again for the second time after King Kong. He and seven other prey are parachuted onto an alien planet for game hunting by the Predators. The prey all stick together to try and find a way off the planet before they all become trophies. The violence in Predators is more extreme than the previous films. It was produced by Rodrigez who made Dusk till Dawn, the vampire flick, and also the upcoming Machete. So you know for sure there is a good amount of bloodshed and gore. This is more of a guy movie, but I'm sure there are girls who are into this stuff too besides Twilight. One of the best scenes is when the prey have alien like dogs sent after them. It is one of the most thrilling scenes in the movie. And you never know which person is going to be the next to die, so at least it isn't too predictable. I honestly didn't think Brody would be a good choice as an action hero, but he surprised me in this one. The guy kicks major ass, especially towards the end. He is definitely not a wimp. All in all, I think you will have a good time with Predators. It can be fun to watch when it isn't being too draggy. I'm sure it will be a great video game.",Predators
275,formicidae,Great mix of old and new.,8,18 July 2010,"I'm surprised at the polarized opinions of Predators here on IMDb. From fans of the original movie (like me), I would have expected a degree of respect for this latest iteration; it seems to honor its predecessors while still offering new twists and depth. Without presenting spoilers, I would simply say that there were developments in Predators that present some exciting opportunities for future films. I also always appreciated Predator for its ""gravitas"", and Predators continues that somber and grim tradition with arguably better acting. For new viewers, I don't see what more could have been expected. It's an old concept (The Most Dangerous Game, with hunted humans), but Predators does a good job with it. The acting is great, the lines are not successive groan-worthy quips, the cinematography is delicious, and the soundtrack is fantastic (segments of the original with new score!). Again, the overall plot isn't new, but at least it's not stupid. The characters behave in a realistic manner, and I wasn't plagued by the ""why-didn't-they-just-do_____?"" question for the entire movie.Frankly, if you read a review from someone with a rating lower than five, they're just not being fair. Predators AT LEAST deserved to be watched and appreciated for what it offers.",Predators
276,ghasl1,IF There is a Bad cast of actors and no Supporting lead of course its going to be Bad,1,25 September 2010,"I was skeptical about this movie because the actors portrayed in it didn't look like the type that would be suitable for a predator movie such as being cunning or physically strong. I had to see it for myself.You know danny trejo/machete he got killed in the beginning of the movie but it didn't even show him get killed or how, it just shows him sitting down. Laurence fishburne he got killed straight away after that it went down hill, I felt like my heart sunk because I knew after he was gone there was no one else that was good in the movie. I mean laurence's character said he spent 8 seasons or 10 years, killed two or three predators took some of the human survivors in then he closed them up and was going to suffocate them in smoke in a room. As soon he was about to leave the predator caught him in the act, and laurence said ""it's about time you found me"" and boom blew him to bits.I mean where was the logic if fishburne wanted the survivors dead because he said there's too many mouths to feed then why help them in the first place. He only had a minor part in the movie same with machete if they didn't bump them off in the movie it could of been good I thought it would pick up after you see laurence with some predator equipment.Also the predator was hunting down Eric from the 70's show he was unarmed so why would the predator chase him anyway no logic there again. I hate the cast of actors after those two familiar faces were gone that was the end, but it wasn't the ending it showed them stuck on the planet so what was the whole point of making this movie then if it had no conclusion?",Predators

Almost nothing to see.Tense music throughout the film doesn't combine with visuals making no tense experience, as if it was just pasted over afterward to qualify it as a tense film even though it isn't.Plot of people from different warrior civilisations amounted to the odd person saying ""in my country we (would do this)..."" and then dieing. So absolutely no action displayed of these fighting styles.Honestly the most awful film I have ever seen. It's not even so bad it's good.I would go on but I think I've said it all, and anything else would risk having to tick the spoiler box for no good reason.

A group of soldiers are to face this unseen new monster themselves being unaware of what their capable of.This film has a little more insight of what these predators do as we learned from Predator 2. I would of liked to have seen more interactive scenes with other deadly creatures the predators kidnapped for this hunt to where we see the predators handy work and the soldiers survival instincts. It's exciting to see two types of tribes of these predators and their rituals as we see an unarmed strung up living predator on a totem pole.It has plenty of action, excellent design on the predators. It's a must own to add to the the sequels because you want to see more of these predators world.",Predators
279,peterlane5,I liked it but I'm still more of an Alien fan,7,11 July 2010,"Certainly better than Predator 2 and just about as good as Predator. But this had a much better story. This is how a Predator movie should be made, the Predators being brutal but swift and in this they are. One instance is when a Predator rips a guy's spine and skull out with a single tug. Half of the characters are well developed but a few others are just there to be cannon fodder. Adrien Brody is pretty good and Topher Grace brings some comic relief. Really the only 3 problems I had with it was that it was filled with action movie clichés. Another thing that made me mad was that Robert Rodriguez stated that this had nothing to with the Alien Vs Predator movies yet I'm almost positive I saw an Alien skull in the Predator camp. And if you are expecting that part where about 14 Predator lasers(which makes us think that there are a lot of them)are pointed at Brody, it isn't in there at all. There are only about four or five Predators in the entire movie. But these minor problems are small compared to how great of an action/Sofie movie this is. But I still prefer the Alien franchise over the Predator franchise.",Predators
280,laurenthoutent,This should have been the 1950s prequel,1,26 January 2011,"This should have been the 1950s prequel to the 1987 movie, at a time when known actors were under contract to do so many films, a few of which would be crappy B flicks.I could see Rock Hudson and Bella Darvi or Jennifer Jones in the main roles. The 1987 Predator would have been the long awaited final sequel.Brainless plot. A bunch of humans parachuted on a planet to be hunted by a handful of predators. Ridiculous weapons that can fire an everlasting supplying of ammunition. They would have needed a small tractor to carry all the bullets they fired. The Russian guy had a M134 minigun. It fires on average 3000 rounds a minute. The rounds come in a 4000 bullets case. Each bullet weights 148 grammes. Each case of rounds would have a weight of 60 kilos.Adrian Brody's gun (AA 12 fully automatic 12 gauge) fire 300 rounds a minute. The rounds are VERY heavy.The suit of the Yakuza must have been made to weird measure in order to accommodate all the clips he was carrying, not to mention to conceal his sword -let's not forget he was wooshed off a street.Why so much action in the dark? Cheaper to shoot in studio, I suppose.Predators with advanced technology use dogs (disposable as we don't see one again), have amazing weapons but are defeated with sticks and knives.And the end ....

281,robo8,Nostalgia with untapped potential,6,20 August 2010,"To let you know where I stand; I'm a fan of the first Predator movie, accepted Predator 2 and discarded the AvP ones.If you yourself is a fan of the first movie there are a lot of nostalgia in this one for you, ranging from how a shot is done (including choice of music) to direct ""quotes"". To me that was all okay, some of it felt a little off, but most of it just struck a chord.The movie in all is okay - not more. At least to me as a Predator fan. If you are new to the franchise I don't know if you'd either find the plot exciting as a lot will be new to you, or if you'll find it confusing since it might assume you already know some things about the premise of the plot.It has a lot of untapped potential though. Looking at the cast I got really excited. A lot of character actors and as a Shield fan I was especially pleased to see Walton Goggins getting a shot. There was potential for some interesting dialog and scenes here.But there was no cherry blossom here though. I reckon a somewhat weak script combined with focus being on the somewhat rushed ""plot"", stole the opportunity away. They just keep moving from place to place at a high pace and I can just remember one time where they sit down and just enact with each other. On top of that the Predators themselves are somewhat peripheral and just appear and disappear so that it pleases the plot.All this makes for just an okay movie (at least if you're a fan) but leaves me wanting more of the good stuff that could have been.",Predators
282,maddog-50,Antal should only do cheap porn from now on...,1,27 January 2013,"...because this is one, too: All actors 'accidentally' come together at one place and they have basically no idea why, or so to say, the writers saw no need, to let the 'characters' tell any reasonable explanation why they are there almost naked (for instance, just to take a shower *cough*). All what the actors know is, that they are going to f* each other, or in Monsieur Antal's case: all the characters know and all the audience is let to know is that they gonna shoot & fight for rest of the movie.The cast as such therefore is usually totally random and because of that usually ridiculous wrong. Adrien Brody with his bath keeper body for the poor really is only lacking the porn mustache whereas the only nature of his character that really matters, is the size of his gun. The rest of the cast is just playing some roles husks where it is actually absolutely irrelevant what they are, because, they all got f*... er killed anyway.So Antal converts the set 'with a non moving sun at another planet' into a orgy of cheap violence with absolutely no suspense, because everybody knows exactly what is going to happen next.All that, in proper porn style, is accompanied by music from the retort to minimize the costs, in Antal's case, the rehashed Alan Silvestri score. If this would be not enough, cheap CGI and a ton of stolen dialogs and scenes from another movie (also called 'Predator', but which has absolutely NOTHING to do with this cheap porn trash here) will do the rest.I have NO idea, what retards gave Antal the job to do this abysmal flick and what retards thought, that this would be a continuation of the franchise. The fact that this p.o.s of a movie still made enough money to break even shows, that the franchise is still strong enough to survive talentless hacks like Antal, which is good! But, please listen to me: let this Antal guy NEVER do a movie this budged again, if you know what i mean...",Predators
283,carvercape,So bad it hurts more than being hunted by one...,1,30 September 2010,"... Predator. Aside they replicated every possible scene from first movie other elements are just poor. First of all casting; it's bad, really bad. Whoever had idea that Adrian Brody can play though guy has misfired big time. Next is acting which is average and to none of actors you will be able to connect in any way. Photography is bit darkish which is maybe desired element in movies meant to scare the audience but here it just does not work, it gives movie a tired look. Screenplay is stupendous and every time action involves predators, well it's like they forget their skill's a bit and humans seem more capable one would imagine. Ending is bad bad so bad. Predator suddenly speaks English and we have a serial killer on our hands here. It's like mixing cliché thriller with bad sci-fi.

Predators though hardly has a redeeming feature. The script what there is of it is awful. The characters are badly written and not believable. This isn't helped by some woeful acting. The cinematography is poor and I can't really say much positive about the directing.The worst thing about the film was the Predators themselves. In the original film The Predator was hard, in the new film the new protagonist Predators don't come close matching the original, they are to easy to kill, what makes it worse is that the original predator has been lowered in its pecking order.I was hoping this film was going to be good, unfortunately it ranks down there with AVP2.",Predators

I begrudge every penny of the ticket cost and the time wasted watching it. The music was dire, the acting not much better and the cast...well. Adrian Brody??? WTF! Hero material he ain't. This film was cheesy, predictable and about as exciting as a day at work. Which is to say not at all. There were so many loose ends, corny one-liners, and so much smell-the-fart acting that I wanted to cringe. My son is 15 and when we left the theatre I asked him what he thought of it. His reaction?

289,Apemangalore,"Finally, a return to form",7,9 July 2010,"This past decade hasn't been particularly kind to the Predator franchise. Keep in mind that this is coming from somebody who is the minority of people who actually enjoyed Predator 2 (despite the ridiculousness of having one of the mandible-faced freaks in Los Angeles in the first place), and feels that the series didn't begin its downward slope until the wasted opportunity of a film known as Alien vs. Predator. Thankfully, however, this latest entry proves to be a return to form, focusing much more on the hunt, while also providing this universe with a surprising amount of depth.My favorite aspect of Predators is how it deftly returns to the roots of the series, placing a much bigger emphasis on the aforementioned hunt. In a jungle. There's just something naturally hostile about being in such an environment, as opposed to city streets, orthe caves of Antarctica? And the unfortunate individuals who are trapped on this Predator home world aren't just standing around, waiting to be picked off like victims in a teen-slasher flick. No, these guys decide to fight back, and it becomes a ton of fun to watch! No, it's not particularly difficult to guess who will and who won't be ending this trip alive, but it's just refreshing to see these victims retaliating for a change.To touch briefly on the audio front, Alan Silvestri's original theme, as well as the classic Predator battle cry, is still firmly intact here. These may not seem like much, but I was surprised by how much they added to the overall experience.And speaking of returning elements, as you might've expected, this film pays homage to several moments from the original Predator, particularly in the third act, when the film simply goes nuts. They're all very much appreciated, but there is one – specifically, a certain line taken out of the first film – that just isn't the same as when it was delivered by Arnold.Nitpicking aside, though, Predators breathes new life into this franchise, providing plenty of new elements that separates it from the pack, while maintaining what was so engaging about the first film. It's a quick distraction, but an entertaining one all the same.",Predators
290,jmcginn174,Finally A Great Summer Movie.,9,16 June 2011,"Predators is the best summer movie so far and one of the best of the year. I'll be honest I've only seen three summer movies. There was Iron Man 2, The A Team and now Predators. It's just been a really Summer for movies. You can just tell by the previews that they aren't going to be remotely good. Now out of the three Predators is the best movie.Predators hearkens back to the first Predators movie. Breaking from the recent horrible Alien Vs Predator movies. The movie has the same feel as the first movie. It also has the same kind of set up a group off harden killers try to survive against a group of Predators. I had some lingering doubts that this movie would be good but I was wrong, it was great. It had a great premise. Instead of hunting on Earth the Predators take humans to another planet. A planet wide game preserve where the Predators hone their skills.The characters introductions won't be a surprise to many people. The loner but reluctant leader. The man with a family. The silent warrior. It goes on from there. There is one character you won't be able to read, because he just doesn't belong with the group which was a nice twist. The actors from Adrien Brody and Topher Grace to Alice Braga and Danny Trejo all did really good jobs with their characters. The only person I had a problem with and the only real problem I had with the movie was Noland (Laurence Fishburne). What was the point of his character except to movie the plot along and they really didn't need him for that. And I like the actor too. He almost always plays interesting characters. It's just in this movie he was pointless.The action and special effects were truly well done. There were many great scenes. But my favorite had to be the scene between Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien) and one of the predators. I won't give anything away but it was one of the best if not the best scenes of the movie.The ending of the movie was open ended which I really liked. There's so many directions they can take this franchise as long as they don't go back to the Alien Vs Predator type of movie I think I'll be happy. Overall this is a excellent movie. Out of the three Predator movies (I just chose to believe the AVP movies never existed) I would have to say this is the second best movie. It was ha hard choice between the first one and this one but I just love the Arnold and the cast of the first movie more. In fact all the Predator movies were great it's just that the first one was the best.Predator 5/5 Predators 5/5 Predators 2 4.5/5",Predators

293,Ben_Horror,A handful of Predators...,7,2 August 2010,"The first jungle-set Predator, released in 1987, went on to become a VHS rental phenomenon throughout the late 80s and the 90s. The second movie, released in 1990, was an admirable attempt at trying to do something different, resetting the events in a violent war zone in Los Angeles. While the story felt a bit episodic, it at least offered some imaginative set pieces. On a more negative note, it also paved the way for the dreaded and completely unnecessary 'Aliens Versus Predators' franchise (or AVP as it became known) with its single shot of an 'Alien skull' on board the Predator's ship. With this new sequel, director Nimród Antal and producer Robert Rodriguez are trying to move away from the excesses of that second movie (broom beating anyone?) and the stupidity of the AVP franchise to get the series back to something approaching the rawness of the original.Predators tells the story of a group of shady individuals (Adrien Brody, Topher Grace et al), all with somewhat violent histories (black ops, sniper, death row inmate, Yakuza member, and um, a doctor, etc.), who wake up in free fall to find themselves hurtling towards a dense jungle. The team don't know how or why they've been put there and spend a lot of time exploring the mysterious terrain, which, in a neat shot, they later discover to be a distant, alien planet. After being attacked by vicious creatures, which we later find out are a type of Predator 'hunting dogs' – sent in to detect the humans and flush them out – the crew realize their purpose on planet is to act as quarry for the Predators to stalk. They flee for their lives rather than face certain death on the ends of the Predators pointy carving knives and that's when the fun ensues.This movie had a lot of potential and the signs were that Rodriguez would finally fulfill his promise to bring the series back on course. To an extent, he even succeeds: this is no AVP mish-mash. It's a violent and over the top caper that was clearly made by fans for fans. There are some exciting set pieces in it and it's very well shot and edited with ideas galore. Surprisingly, Adrien Brody even makes for a cool, credible action hero and suits the role down to the ground, creating a good contrast to big Arnie in the original. While watching it, you really think this will be the Predator movie to beat them all, the one you always dreamed of But somehow things go pear-shaped and it doesn't quite live up to the initial premise Rodriguez, clearly wearing his heart and influences on his sleeve, intends this to be a follow up to Predator in the same way that Aliens was to Alien. It even references a line from the Cameron sequel - 'If it comes to that, I'll do us both' - plus we get a whiny 'Hudson' type character in the shape of a death row inmate that is pretty much played in the same mode Bill Paxton played Hudson in Aliens.Also, this is meant to be a movie where the protagonists are not battling one enemy but several. But fans will be in for a shock: we don't get the masses of Predators promised by the infamous trailer (remember the bit where Adrien Brody's chest is targeted by numerous distinctive red Predator laser sights?): at best we only get a handful. Strangely, even though the same shot appears in the movie, we only see a few targeting lasers on his torso, which begs the question: why would the makers so obviously deceive the audience with an intentionally doctored shot in a trailer that promises so much more than it actually delivers? Worse, this sly deception is even explained away with the lazy implication that the humans of the story are really what's being referred to in 'Predators' of the title and not the Predators themselves Oh ,okay Some things in the movie don't work. The imprisoned predator at the Predator camp (don't ask) serves no real purpose. It's built up to be something really significant, but proves utterly pointless by the end. Then later on, a Predator-on-Predator fight makes the film start to resemble AVP – the very thing it's trying to avoid in the first place. Even a last minute sudden character shift is so abrupt and unconvincing, you wonder if it was stuck in at the last minute. And just what is Laurence Fishburne doing here? His role is another pointless aspect that drags the pace down for no reason. It also signposts the movie's gaping plot hole: when Larry makes his first appearance, he is camouflaged by wearing the iconic Predator helmet, which offers cloaking properties But surely this would have been a vital tool for Adrien Brody and friends to use against the predators? Surely Adrien would have done his damnedest to get his hands on such a valuable weapon when trying to escape from the crashed ship Fishburne has been using as his refuge? The problem is, the helmet disappears from the film without explanation There are also nods to the 1987 Predator flick: someone gets injured and must be carried through the jungle; one character willingly stands his ground to go head-to-head with a predator; we even get a waterfall dive and yet another shirt-less punch up with a Predator. Still, the film is entertaining enough and definitely worth a look. While it's nowhere near as good as the classic Schwarzenegger original, it's probably more or less on par with the 1990 sequel, which in itself was nothing to write home about. However, when compared to the 'Aliens Vs Predators' franchise, especially the dribble that was AVP Requiem, it's nothing short of a masterpiece. In a word, while not quite a disaster, the viewer comes away with the uncomfortable feeling that this is something of a missed opportunity.",Predators

295,Tim851,The more I think about it...,5,10 November 2010,"I kinda enjoyed it.But it's a rehash of the original and will as such always suffer. You have certain problems, like the original only showed the Predator later in the film in all its cloaky glory. But since then we've all seen Predators, lots of them. So should a movie still try to make the eventual revealing of them climactic? I don't know. 'Predators' didn't and it worked for me.The Gang had little chemistry. There were too many of them. I correctly predicted the succession in which they would die though - except for the first one. They also took their situation surprisingly calm. I didn't expect Wangst and philosophical debate, but when they realized the first twist, I did expect more than a few looks of disbelief.Adrian Brody was fine. Don't know what everybody has against him. He looks 1000 times more Black Ops than Schwarzenegger, who due to his muscles-for-looks would be too slow, too bulky and too quickly out of breath. His character was a bit to omniscient.Lawrence Fishburne's character was a nice surprise. So sad they didn't go anywhere with him. He also looked a bit chubby for his situation.Topher Grace is continuing to not have a career. His character was weird. Nobody questioned his nature, not even Mr. Know-it-all Brody. His last five minutes on screen were kinda stupid.Hm. I don't know, I gave it a 5/10 when I started this review.

In this film instead of being in Guatemala like the first film, they are in Predator territory, basically their plant. Ten killers are sent to this planet to be hunted by the Predators. One of the killers is the character Isabelle who was supposed to be the character from the first Predator. It was definitely hard to believe that it was was supposed to be the same woman because of the fact that the actress Alice Braga is only in her 30′s, that was one of their mistakes I caught during the film. Besides that error the film was awesome, it is just like the other 2 films where it is basically that each person their gets killed off one by one and then just leaves to of the main characters left, that's the typical horror movie plot. I was very skeptical on this film in many ways. Number one would be that Robert Rodriguez was directing this film. Number two was when I saw the commercial I thought it was a total remake, well I was wrong. After seeing the movie, I was blown away on how good the movie was because even though I love horror movies, they are not perfect. This movie was close to perfect.

300,drakula2005,"I'll give it 10/10, because it stands on par with ""Aliens"" as the best, non-original Alien/Predator movie ever!",10,9 July 2010,"Honestly, this review is very special for me, because, when i think about it, i can't recall another occasion, when i wrote a review, without seeing the rate of the movie.So as my first time, i have to say, that i don't need a side opinion, because this movie was the best sequel to an Alien or a Predator movie, maybe, reaching the heights of James Cameron's Aliens.Robert Rodriguez sure raised the bar with this third installment, although, a lot of time was needed to do so.Adrien Brody does a good Arnie role, adding a little more darkness to the character.And he worked out a lot, it's obvious.And in one thing, Predators is stronger even than the Arnie-driven original.And that's the development.And for such a movie-a hunting movie, that's very hard.Gamer is a good example of movie, where you just don't give a ... about the characters.And honestly, Predator had an issue of itself, as well.And that i find very good for the installment.I liked the intensity of the situation as well.I don't know, if it is because i saw the original on tape, but i just was'n feeling it.But this one-i saw it at a small pre-premiere theatre, where one is able to hear even the crew shooting the movie :) And when you hear each and every single footstep, more or less, you stand on the edge of your seat, waiting something to happen.That's why i found it so intense.Another thing i liked was the Laurence Fishbourne cameo, eclipsed only by the Bill Murray cameo in Zombieland, in recent memory.It was cool, claustrophobic and a little bit crazy, but a needed step into making the movie fresh enough and breaking the atmosphere.The other were fun to watch as well-Rodriguez's favourite, Danny Trejo, was interesting as ever, although, the little on-screen time for him.The others did a fine job as well, especially Alice Braga and the ""unsure"" Topher Grace.Another visually good thing were the flora and fauna at the planet.The special effects were OK, and the predators looked very convincing, and most important, faster than before, although their on-screen time is measurable to Danny Trejo's.The hounds were something cool and new, seeing the movie needed something like this, to pull itself out from the original.All in all, Robert Rodriguez made an incredibly refreshing movie, memorable and Nimrod Antal shoot it perfectly.Seeing Predator 2 very recently, i think this movie is way better than it's predecessor.I'm giving it the full note, and i'll see it again with some friends very soon! My grade-10/10",Predators
301,antant-13838,Big fan of this film,8,10 February 2019,"First off I'm a huge predator fan. I love this film. It gives a great take on the predator hunted theme which is basically the same story every generation, and also a smart remake. Great cast every performance hits the write mark and the script does everything it should without any fluff. The ever evolving Predator works perfectly with some great updates. It's a shame Rodriguez didn't follow this on cause that I would have wanted to see. I can see why some fans weren't happy, especially with the Fishburn character but for me it's all very good.",Predators
302,moviefreak2010,"After 23 years, they finally made the sequel that is in vein with the original",10,9 July 2010,"Seeing the original as a kid with the old VHS tape brings back good memories. Watching Arnold kick butt and then gets his butt kicked by the sneaky alien.Predator 2 was not bad but it had lost touch of the original by making it just a gore feast sci/fi horror film.AVP.......PUT IT THIS WAY....DUMB AND FOREVER BE DUMB.Predators, on the other hand, brings back the elements that I enjoyed in the first one. However, it didn't start too well at first, its wasn't till 20-25 minutes in it where the movie gets really interesting. The story really has a lot of twist and turns (more at the end) that keeps you going and going. I thought the characters in the movie were well develop and stood alone as their own like with the first one. Like with the story, twist and turns with their characters that got me really intense.I was very pleased that Nimrod Antal represented the intense and creepy atmosphere tone that made the first one a classic. Having only seen one of his films, Vacancy (which I liked except for the ending), he was the perfect choice for the director. He was like what John McTiernan used to be when he first started out. Overall, some things could of work a little better in the beginning but it was a great movie and a great sequel to the John McTiernan classic. A flat 10/10.",Predators
303,rumbleinthejungle,Half of a great Predator movie,5,23 July 2010,"Just like after you scoff down a cheeseburger and Coke with fries, 'Predators' leaves you with that vague feeling of being unsatisfied despite the fact that you know you have just stuffed yourself stupid. Indeed, this film gives the viewer the opportunity to gorge himself silly on SFX, explosions and the like but still the feeling persists that the makers are far to conscious of making a film as close as possible to the first Predator film that they forget to inject any sense of personality into the proceedings here. So what we are left with is a kind of very calculated (but boring) homage to the first film that fails to capture any of the originals sense of menace and style. To be fair, I really liked the set-up of Predators - the motley bunch of mercenaries and criminals all slowly piecing together the puzzle that led to their being dropped on the strange alien planet and the sense that the Predators are always watching them and slowly closing in on the group. The second half of the film feels like the directors and writers don't know, or aren't sure, how to put it all together though. I remember the really exhilarating realization of thinking 'Wow - it's just Dutch and the Predator left!' at the end of the first Predator film and that sort of climax seems conspicuously absent here. It's not a terrible film - it just feels like half of a return to form and, ultimately, a missed opportunity.",Predators
304,darthMisaskernew,Still holds up...better than the Shane Black movie by far!,8,29 December 2018,"Robert Rodriguez making a Predator movie sounds awesome, and it is! I loved this movie when it first came out in theaters. Keep in mind, we had been having a string of terrible PG-13 Alien Vs Predator movies that DO NOT COUNT! But yeah they are terrible movies, so it was SO refreshing to see a new movie in the franchise made by a good director, produced by people who actually cared about Predator, and more. The plot is very suspenseful. It is about a group of randomly chosen people dropped into a strange jungle, where we later learn is actually the Predator's planet and the people are some of the most dangerous people from around the world! Mercenaries, spies, warlords, serial killers, survivalists, and top rank soldiers. It was a very cool idea for the predators to select the most badass and feared people on Earth to hunt in a game of survival on their home planet. All of the characters are really cool, and I dont really like Adrian Brody but this was the first thing I saw him in that made me like him, though I wish Danny Trejo would of lasted longer then he does. Watching these characters unfold the pieces of the puzzle is really suspensful because doesn't know what is going on either. The CGI is top knotch and probably could of been nominated for an Oscar. The cinematography is great too. I remember thinking this was the most clear HD camera quality I had ever seen in a movie back in 2010 and while a lot of movies nowadays look the same or even better, the cinematography still holds up and makes the green jungle look very creepy. The action scenes also rule! The gore is AWESOME and blew my mind back in 2010, because big theatrical films simply did not show the amount of exploding heads or spilled intestines that this movie did. There is a guy who gets his spine ripped out while he's still alive, and that is such a brutal but cool death in a movie. Oh and of course the kickass Predator theme from the original film makes multiple appearances! So if the action, gore, effects, acting, characters, story, music, and suspense all work, then what is wrong? My main issue is that the film comes to a GRINDING HALT once Laurence Fishbourne enters the film. I love Fishbourne, he's one of my favorite actors, but he is TERRIBLE in this movie (mostly from the writing, not the acting) and has no point whatsoever! He shows up, is really awkward and confusing, and dies. The pacing in the first half was so good that it is very sad to see the film fall apart in the second half. Even, after Fishbourne dies, the film never really recovers and suddenly we at in the climax. Before Fishbourne shows up, the film is a 10/10, but afterwards, it becomes a 6/10. That averages for an 8/10. Even with this issue, i still think Predators is very good and worth a watch or two. It's WAY better than the craptastic 2018 Shane Black mess where the Predator becomes Deadpool in a few scenes and does lol-tastic slapstick humor. What was Shane Black thinking????? He should have watched this movie instead! BONUS! This movie was filmed in my home city of Austin, Texas and I recognzied some of the filming locations, so that's awesome!",Predators

307,daryl42-1,"Maybe if the Predators carried some of the suspense and menace they initially had, this one would be up to par with the original.",7,22 July 2010,"7.2The original Predator film was a good movie. It had good suspense, and had little trouble grabbing the audience's attention. The final moments, where the protagonist and the villain are trying to outsmart each other, are some of the best moments in the movie. The sequel wasn't so good. The spin- offs, like the Aliens vs. Predator series, weren't great either. The new film, Predators, seemed to have promise.And it is true. Predators is a good movie. It's way better than any of the Predator films after the first one, except for the first one itself. However, it's not as good as some Predator fans might have hoped it would be. Predators starts off really good. The protagonist wakes up in free fall and after he lands, he meets up with the other recruits. They are lost in the jungle and little by little, they start to realize that they are not alone. Then, they start to realize that they are not being hunted by men. This is where Predators goes downhill. From here, nothing interesting really happens, and the audience just rides out the kills until the film's conclusion.Still, Predators is not a bad movie. There are some scenes in the movie that are actually surprising to see, because they contrast most of the film. Some of the far away shots are impressive and do a lot for the movie. Unfortunately, a good chunk of the movie is really dark, and really boring. This is mostly when they board the derelict ship. Quite possibly the film's major flaw are the Predators themselves. They rarely appear, and when they do, it just gives the effect of a man in a suit running around. There is none of the fear or suspense that is found in the original film. The Predators fell flat on their stomachs in this one, which is a shame. Maybe if the Predators were a little bit more interesting, at least carrying some of the suspense or menace that they did in the original film, maybe things would have been a lot better. Or maybe if the plot itself was a little better, and the second half of the film didn't slow down and bog down. Then maybe Predators would have been up to par with the original. Still, as it is, it's not really a bad film, and some of the shots are really good. If you're a Predator fan, you should definitely check this one out.",Predators
308,ZeTomes,Hollywood Baloney,4,15 April 2015,"As a fan of Predator's original 1st movie (the supreme food chain leader, not Humans anymore) I was always fascinated by the extreme depth and richness of Predator's creation and complexity, ultimately, the reflection of ourselves our brutality and our fears. Although shown in minimalistic but very elegant traces, the 1st movie was excellent in scripting that complexity into a consisted sci-fi cinema villain who still remains in pop culture, waiting yet for a new movie capable of keeping its quality.Predator's essence was neither good nor bad; he was the symbol of life in its brutal form: a metaphor and a reflex of human's ""dark side"" nature, a critic of our own cynical behavior because we do the same kind of sports and we do behave with the same brutality with animals, with other humans too, for purposes that aren't in any way honorable. At the bottom of Schopenhauer's philosophy and by the discernment of our reality, we live in a brutal world, therefore we share that same brutality. So we create a god of something we cannot understand although we're part of, to better deal with it: Predator or Mars the god of war.And ""how about we change sides so you people would mirror yourselves as preys?"" is what Predator makes you wonder while rising the bridge for a potential non hypocrite ""good side"" and making a severe critic of human behavior.Fact is ""predators"" although brutal didn't kill unarmed victims, nor pregnant women even being extremely far away from their homeland without any ethical bonds to connect or attach... but we Humans do kill innocent people, and not that far from our homes, and with many eyes upon us! Just pick a war.After all Predator hunted on an already rolling war scenario (guerrilla wars) choosing only the strongest as adversaries. A fearsome warrior with a code of honor and respect so strong that endured in an Alien planet. How can this guy be worst than us? The first two Predator movies (mostly the 1st) had very existentialistic and poetic scenes that might not be seen at first glance contributing to Predator's character; the predator's hand view next to the lifeless scorpion, the ""echogram"" showing an human embryo, the acknowledge of human verbalization, the eventual ""communication"" at the last predator's moments as many more scenes present in the movie. Every aspect of the script has some subtleness and depth making this 1sr movie special and not just an action sci-fi story. That's why McTiernan's movie is the keystone and the catapult to the franchise.Dutch was a soldier rose in a violent society as also as Predator's culture and nature shaped his behaving, but both had actions that somehow contradicted their primal warrior code making them so unique and bonded to the audience. Both had individual codes of honor shown on many sequences of the movie, despite the scenario they were in.Like titans, they fought with some kind of mutual interest and respect originating a kind of relation (I remember how I laughed when Dutch tries to convince the Predator to fall in a trap while him like a cat evading his strategy is grabbing a leaf knowing he is being fooled) becoming true archetypes for the audience.Their nature wasn't quite equal to their environment as for as one of them was tragically neutralized: you feel attachment and sorrow for the predator's death. ""Your true enemy is the one that understands you most"". You could wonder that while the wounded and introspected Dutch is being transported home after the predator's dramatic self destruction.You just cannot put the feeling away of wondering of a better world while the sad musical score is passing, seeing Dutch not anymore as an action winner hero, but as a disappointed wounded soldier covered with ashes and mud - The opposite of the beginning of the movie. Victory is not just what only matters.This kind of insight was what I (ingeniously) expected on Predators. To learn about their culture and complex social structure, to see the architecture of their world and nature, to see a possible bridge of communication, to see poetry and metaphors of ourselves: none of this happened. Except for the brief moments Laurence Fishburne's character is introduced entering you on his domains. You feel the story might change for a good sci-fi comic style, the next moment you feel deceived when he turns mad next to be blown by a very bad special effect...Everything gets worse from this point, You just feel the director used the same Hollywood brainless formulas over and over without any kind of insight, specially when the last expectation (major Predator unmasked) is revealed to be a conclusion of what you initially spotted: A Rubbish in its completeness fed by Predator's original creation with some moments that almost fooled you with hope. Scripting is the skeleton that makes the difference between a good and a bad movie. This one is an imitation with just superficial scratches of your initial expectations.It's imperative to see the 1st Predator to understand what I am saying.",Predators
309,saprater,Surprisingly good,9,17 July 2010,"I saw and loved the original Predator and watched all the subsequent installments because of that loyalty to the first film, but it wasn't until Predators that I felt like I was truly viewing a sequel. The film is definitely a modern and updated version (not just in special effects). Not a fault of the original; it was a product of its time, but the grittiness, diversity, and character development of Predators just make it a wonderfully polished product.My one concern going in was Adrian Brody being cast as the main protagonist. Brody is an actor that I don't associate with action film, so I hadn't really known what to expect and odd scenarios of his character waxing philosophical on an alien planet did occasionally pop in my head, but I have to admit that his performance was one of the strongest, and I he not only drew audiences to his portrayal of Royce but handled the physical scenes really well. In fact, all the casting was pretty dead on, though the one weak spot I believe the film had was in Topher Grace's character. Not the actor himself, who did a very credible job, but his role in the film, which was a bit of a disappointment. I could think of several alternate story lines that could have been better used to justify his presence.Other than that, the film was very good. Fans of the first movie will, no doubt, catch all the little homages in this one. There were quite a few, hopefully all done from respect for the franchise and not b/c of unoriginality...lol...but seriously, this is an excellent sequel that will help to wash away the unpleasant taste left by Predator 2 and the AvP series.",Predators
310,antialias11,How did this get a theatrical release?,2,28 August 2018,"Just picked this up in a triple pack with Predator I and II (for the nostalgia). Hadn't seen this one when it came out so this was my first go at it..
It has taken me 4 sittings to watch this to the end, because I got bored and turned the movie off each time. No, not for lack of action scenes, but because it quickly descended into ""don't care"" territory.First things first - the cast:
Erm. I don't remember (and I just switched it off a few minutes ago). Danny Trejo is somewhere in there, but he gets woefully underused. He might have made a really good protagonist along the lines of Schwarzenegger and Glover, but, alas, they went with the people who are neither interesting, nor believable in their roles. I'm not going to comment on the lack of acting skills all around. This is an action movie and no one expects acting skills. But, dear lord, do the actors phone it in. One sentence conversations that convey only hints in low voices that are...what? Supposed to sound enigmatic? Portentious? More like pretentious. I have no idea what the screenwriters were thinking when they pinned down these lines of text. How they got Laurence Fishburne to play in this I'll never know. But he certainly didn't care enough to put any effort in, either.The music: Predator theme. That's basically it. No alteration or evolution discernible. It's OK, I guess, but where the theme built during the original movie here it's just thrown in whenever.Screenplay: What screenplay? This movie jumps from plothole to plothole and cliché to cliché, throwing a bunch of pithy one-liners our way.
None of the protagonists are likeable. It's not clear how many antagonists there are either, so the stakes are never clear. if they had decided to just nuke the entire protagonist group at minute 30 and replace it with someone else I couldn't have cared less. 
As for story. In light of the reason for them being there the first two Predator movies make no sense (or vice versa). The attempt at a 'plot twist' makes even less sense. The way they are attacked makes - given the setup - least sense of all.FX: The effects in this movie look horribly dated (heck, even the effects in the first Predator hold up better - and that was from 1987!)Final verdict: Avoid. At all costs. It gets 2 stars instead of one because there are theoretically worse movies out there (come to think of it: the Alien vs Predator flics are a contender for this 'honor')",Predators
311,firstruleofmethclub,An under-appreciated action-come-sci-fi-horror that is the best entry in the Alien/Predator franchise since the original Predator,8,15 April 2015,"I can honestly say this is my favourite entry in the Alien/Predator franchise since the original Predator in 1987. It completely restored validity to the Predator series that was called into question with the release of Alien VS Predator and Requiem.Predators touches on some Grindhouse conventions without slipping into the cheesiness of it. I can only imagine what good it would have done for the franchise if this had been the sequel to Predator, and Predator 2, AVP and Requiem all faded away like a bad dream, then the time wasted on those was put to better use continuing the vein of this and the original. (Let it be known that I actually like the AVP films more than most people).There's plenty of actors to take note of; Adrien Brody (The Pianist, King Kong, Splice) as Ex- Black Ops Mercenary Royce, whom both emulates Schwarzenegger and takes the lead in a new direction; Danny Trejo (Machete, Death Race 2) as Chuchillo who's a brutal enforcer from the Los Zetas drug cartel in Mexico; Oleg Taktarov (Rollerball, Righteous Kill) as Nikolai, Russian Heavy Weapons Spetsnaz Alpha Group commander (whom my friend Calum introduced me to, he's a fan of the guy from his UFC days); Laurence Fishburne (Apocalypse Now, The Matrix) as Noland, a US Air Cav. soldier who's survived for a long time before the others even arrive, and has already killed at least two predators, and Topher Grace (Spider- Man 3, That 70's Show) as Edwin, a doctor whom doesn't seem to fit in with the band of elite killers that have dropped from the sky. All these kids are always worth watching, but I was also introduced to Walton Goggins (House of 1000 Corpses, The World's Fastest Indian) I've watched movies he's been in before, but never really took note of him until Predators in which he played death-row mass-murderer Stans, and he was bloody brilliant, and hilarious to boot.Though there were some obvious problems with character relations and developments, that can be a problem with the set-'em-up-and-knock-'em-down type of film that Predators had to have. Unfortunately the major issue I have with Predators just plain plays it too safe. Though I majorly enjoyed it, Predators could have been even better if it took further in the directions it was looking in. They took some great steps, and hopefully we'll see director Nimrod Antal (Armored, Vacancy) and Producer Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk till Dawn, Sin City) come back and take the Predator franchise in the direction that it deserves to be taken.Everything old about Predators is right, everything new about Predators is amazing, there's room for improvement to be sure, but I don't think I'll ever get sick of Predators, which is the absolute most impressive thing I can hope to get from a movie.

312,commander_zero,The audience is their willing victim,3,14 July 2010,"My son and I had just watched ""Point Break,"" with its harrowing skydiving scenes. Maybe this is why Adrien Brody's opening free fall, meant to be breathtaking, comes across as lifeless CGI. ""Lifeless"" is a good description of the film as a whole--it becomes a genuine action film only in fits and starts, such as the humans' discovery of the alien camp, and the fight between the yakuza character and the predator--even though the latter setup is such an obvious ripoff of the ""log bridge"" scenes from the first ""Predator."" For this film, ""ripoff"" is an unfair term--it is not that the screenwriters knowingly stole out of laziness, it is just that they are obviously fanboys who have never read anything but comic books and have never seriously delved into the dynamics that make a good action film. The film is full of great actors, all of whom are better represented in other movies. Perhaps this is true of all action films, but certainly ""Predator 2"" at some point gave performers such as Danny Glover, Gary Busey and Bill Paxton the chance to do what they do best. This could be one reason that ""Predator 2"" is the best film in the series, although in comparison to ""Predators,"" even the much-maligned Paul WS Anderson ""Alien vs Predator"" is looking better all the time.",Predators

This movie is the type of movie you should watch when nothing else is available on TV.There are so many negative aspects on the movie: 1) bad management of soundtrack: 95% of the movie you have the suspenseful violin sound trying to tell you ""something bad is coming"", even when the guys are hidden talking... and nothing bad happens. 2) cheesy dialogs: people had to climb to higher ground to see a planet that occupies 90% of the sky just to say: ""change of plans"". Or, when one of our heroes gets hunt down by one of the predators, he says: ""what else have you got?"". And I could keep going. 3) anyone have seen Danny Trejo? looks like he got lost in the set and no one could find him, not even the predators.4) Predator's armor gets pierced by pistol ammunition. And a Predator claw, although it can go through Alien acid and its exoskeleton, can't cut through a Japanese katana. 5) predator's shoulder cannon is a muffin tosser. Not only its accuracy is laughable, but also a clean shot of it will only produce a superficial wound in a person.6) Predators, although bigger and stronger, although being outstanding hunters/killers, although they hunt aliens as trophies, can't overcome a yakuza with a katana.I am a fan of Alien movies, and I enjoyed AVP saga, but this one is a flop.

A Predator(s) somehow collecting all those lowlifes from wherever with no one ever noticing or seeing anything (not even the captives themselves)& depositing them on another planet to hunt later.O'KAY!! Why not just hunt them here on Earth just like in the first 2 films? Why go through all that complicated bull$hit? What amazes me is most of the folks here who bitched about AvP & AvP:Requiem allegedly being crap, don't seem to notice or care that the same elements that they disliked in those 2 films are present in this one. Predator helping a human against ANOTHER PREDATOR no less NOT an alien species. Not only that but help him try to steal their only ride off the planet?-C'mon! The woman in AvP at least proved her worth & honor in battle against the Aliens & saving the life of a Predator. This guy in Predators-not so much. Why didn't the Predator just kill him then battle the other predator? Also ""Predators"" contained a group of boring ass characters. I didn't care half as much about them as I did Arnold's or Danny Glover's groups. Also ""Predators"" was a virtual retelling of the 1st film. And now there is supposedly a inner-species war between the elders & the younger predators-wtf? In retrospect maybe they should've gone with that storyline a bit more. And Topher Grace's character no more looked or acted like a convincing serial Killer than Pinnocho from Shrek. I know he tried to come across like a Ted Bundy but failed. And finally, wtf is Laurence Fishburne doing in this picture-a filled out filler? Not to shabby for a guy allegedly living on scraps on a foreign planet for a decade no less? These group predators looked like & acted like a tamed-down versions of their kin from Predator 2. Where were the different weapons they used (I.e. the net, the spear,the disc etc..)? At least with AVP we saw something fun & different with a further insight into the honor & hunting codes of the predator clans. With ""Predators""-nada! I like AvP Requiem better (yes I said it!) because it was more fun-more carnage, gore, mayhem & suspense. It took them decades to make another Predator movie & this is the best they could do?

(again),9,14 April 2012,"After the damaging, degrading farce of Alien vs Predator and the illogically green-lit and unfortunately executed AvP: Requiem, this was something of a return to form for an iconic, groundbreaking and undoubtedly beleaguered SF institution, to my mind! it was created with a relatively small budget and it did seek to pay homage to and mimic the original Predator film a lot, but after the aforementioned train-wrecks which wasted the potential of the cross-over, this was a marked improvement and for me a welcome addition to the predator series; the film is peppered with signature lines from Predator, as well as abundant references to moments in it, the Alien films, and even references to Scarface - 'say goodbye to your little friend' and Apocalypse Now - Fishburne's character humming 'The Ride of the Valkyries', which was a wonderful moment for me, as it transcended a simple reference, also being an implication that perhaps he was playing the same soldier he played in AN - indeed, that soldier would fit the predators' criteria as he gunned down a bunch of unarmed Vietnamese fishers in Coppola's classic.some might accuse the film of being too much of a homage and not enough its own movie, but for me it instead displayed an attentive reverence for those things which made Predator so intense and simultaneously so much fun in the first place, and by repeating certain scenes in different contexts, with roles reversed etc. it represented a refreshing return to the kind of film the original was, with a novel stratum the characters find themselves in; indeed Predator 2 sought to do this, providing an alternative urban setting, and AvP: R also also respected its source material, elementary, essential plot flaws fatally undermining that project.one of the things which made the original so effective, which was emulated successfully, was the avoidance of an outside perspective; we are immediately plunged into the grave situation our characters find themselves in, and discover the permutations of that situation with them; of course, as viewers and, in most cases, existing fans, we already know largely what to expect, and given the characters' skills as predators themselves, the pace at which they learn about their predicament is impressively fast and furious.they're all killers, mercenaries, soldiers, guerrilla fighters, gangsters, convicts and psychopaths; this is why the predators picked them and beyond the obvious parallel which underpins the entire plot it's also interesting to have a group of characters who are essentially difficult to root for; and yet, i was sad when the RUF fighter died at the predator camp, when Russian Mac went back for the good doctor and got sliced and diced for his trouble, and when the Yakuza and the predator felled each other, in spite of who these people were.This was down to immersive, high quality acting - Brody was a pleasant surprise, even after that slightly silly fight with the predator at the camp; the Yakuza was stone-cold, the convict was a convict, Danny Trejo was Danny Trejo... that's no bad thing guys! I thought it was pretty funny, which leads me to yet another thing i liked about this film - it had a sense of humour; Fishburne's cameo was memorable, as he pops up halfway through the film in full, activated predator garb, and he's hilarious and completely convincing as a careful survivor who's lost it after years alone, in spite of his slightly portly appearance; his character was a masterstroke that practically made this film for me.although the moon they see in the sky next to this game reserve planetoid is far too close realistically, the fact it's a game reserve is still an amazing idea; the predators seed a world with flora and fauna from various other worlds they visit, hand-picking specific, dangerous beings from them and dropping them onto this one, engaging them in the hunt, learning from their illustrious prey; additionally, there are different clans of predator, who war with each other as well; this is a tantalising world which could be explored and developed in a huge number of ways, with this film only showing the tip of the iceberg;i found the fight between the captive predator with the familiar mask and face and the larger predator who ran the camp to be a little disappointing; OK, the familiar 'dog' predator had been restrained, probably malnourished and comparatively exhausted, as well as being smaller then the 'wolf'; the final fight between Wolf and Royce wasn't as memorable as one might have hoped as well; but the ending with Royce and Isabella's observation and declaration was an enticing invitation to continue the safari, and if they do make more movies, I hope the same creative team return, along with the cast, if they choose to follow Royce and Isabella further, and they are given more resources to further explore the possibilities offered by this predator world.There was the danger that this could retread old ground too closely - I maintain that it has merely given value to its legacy; it could have made a mess of a great idea, instead providing an intriguing glimpse into its possibilities, it could have hammered further nails into a franchise rocked by the insipid AvP films, instead potentially reviving it by going back to what it did best in the first place, and it could have undermined itself with a set of half-hearted and/or misinterpreting performances, but we were treated to a darkly comic, intensely convincing, thoroughly human set of predators, who made the hunt a memorable one. But here, among the monsters, I'm normal. I like it here. I wanna stay. ""There is no hunting like the hunting of a man. And those who've hunted armed men long enough, and like it, never really care for anything else thereafter."" I give Predators 9/10!",Predators
318,Hollywoodrulez,Expected More,7,20 November 2010,When I heard Rodregiuez was producing I had to see it. I enjoyed it however there was just something missing for me. I can't quite put my finger on what exactly but something lacked. The cinematography struck me as plain as well. It had the chance to be better than AVP2 but it just wasn't. On a happier note the VFX were awesome and the performances were great too. It had an old school predator vibe but I think the lack of quality camera work just let down the new school story. I almost predicted every place Nimrod chose to put the camera as I did in the first predator. However the one shot from the tree canapé was great. Worth a watch but not brilliant.,Predators
319,harry-austin,The only different aspect of this film to the first one is the 'S' added to the end of the title.,5,11 June 2011,"Predator (1987) a group of elite American Soldiers are hunted down gradually in the heart of the rain forest. Predators (not the 'S' which is the only definable difference) is again, a group of 'elite killers' who are hunted down by a group of 'Predators' rather than just the one. That is the only difference of any significance.What really made me give this review only 5 stars is that why did they choose Adrian Brody for the leading role? Yes, he is a talented actor, and off the top of my head he is an Academy Award winner, but lets look at his previous two major roles. A Jewish pianist on the run in Nazi Germany, and then a playwright in King Kong. What made the creators of 'Predators' believe that he would be suitable for the role? He is hardly a Schwarzenegger for the 2000s. What happened to all of the supposed 'action actors' in Hollywood? Did they all run away?The setting, is obviously different, as it is on another planet. However in essence, the scenery looks identical to that in the first film. I found this a bit irritating, as I instantly thought that the plot would definitely be identical.The plot was, lets face it, the same as the original. I heard many lines that matched what Schwarzenegger had said in the first film 'Kill me! Do it now!' was very recognisable. They all slowly died, and even the way that Brody killed the final Predator was the same. He was covered in mud running around flames and various traps and other obstacles. It would have been nice to see some more radical differences. At least in the second film, with Danny Glover, it was set in Los Angeles, which made it a very different film as a result. Therefore, because of the unusual choices in the cast and the lack of originality in the plot, I am only giving this film five stars. Needless to say however, it was still an enjoyable view, even if it was a predictable plot.",Predators
320,jacob-l-williams,Surprisingly good,6,13 July 2010,"Now before I begin the review of the newest Predators film, I have to admit that I haven't seen any of the previous Alien or Predator films as the whole idea of Alien's attacking humans is something that has never really interested me, it is for that reason that when I began to watch the newest one I had no idea to what to expect and I have to say it was a pleasant surprise.From the outset the narrative is obviously incredibly lame; ten random humans are dropped in a jungle by 'Predators' an alien species and try to steal the spaceship... not exactly original, however what the narrative lacks is made up for in other areas. The acting is all good with Adrien Brody being another surprise showing his diversity in order to pull off an action hero role which after watching him The Pianist I didn't think he would pull off. The directing by Nimrod Antal is also very good and you can definitely see elements of his previous work in Vacancy as the film plays out.The action sequences are superbly done with the right amount of cuts and tension and I have to say I was really enjoying myself until the Predators came into the film. The Predators for me ruined the film as they were a big disappointment for what they where, maybe if I had seen the previous versions with them in I would have expected this but I did not and I just thought they seemed really stupid and pointless with the heat vision etc. It feels really random to say that The Predators are the worst part of a film titled Predators but if I'm honest its true, before their introduction the film is building well and I was asking loads of questions about why they where 'chosen' and what exactly was hunting them, then to discover that they where chosen just so some aliens could play a game just seem ridiculous.Predators is a good film, far from great but good and I now know what to expect from the Alien and Predator movies and although I don't think I'll go looking to watch them, if I see that ones on TV I might take the time to watch and who knows could become a massive fan.7/10",Predators
321,Fielga,Really fun action flick,8,30 May 2012,"I let movies stand on their own merit without holding them to their predecessors for reference on the value of a particular movie. In that aspect, I thought this was really fun!Rather than focusing on the Predators coming to Earth to hunt, this places our heroes on an alien game preserve where the Predators seem to train and to study their prey of all sorts from across the universe. I thought this was a clever and refreshing way to put something new out there.The plot unfolds as we watch a group of seemingly random people slowly figure out that they've been kidnapped and brought to some distant planet to be used as prey. The action scenes are magnificent, watching the humans struggle to outwit their captors is just the right amount of tense, and the end payoff is absolutely great. I hope those showing an interest will go ahead and give it a shot.",Predators
322,kirkwuk,Worse than AVP? You decide!,3,18 July 2010,"Well to say I went in there with very low expectations, and came out disappointed tells you a lot about what I thought of this film.Absolutely dire, forgettable post-2K crap, cookie-cutter profanity laced dialogue, horrible actors who really couldn't care less (with the exception of Laurence Fishburne) - this was horrible! They could have at least added a Ricky Gervais or Ben Stiller cameo in there while they were murdering the franchise, possibly Peter Kay doing the ""fine rain that soaks you through"" gag when he gets gutted by the Predators claw and gets sprayed in the face by blood. Not even the original score could save this one. That says a lot.Can't wait for Predators vs Michael Myers in 2014!",Predators
323,wittmann73,disappointing indeed,4,12 July 2010,"I didn't expect much of this film but was still disappointed. The actors are not very convincing, the plot not very suspenseful and it is hard to identify with any of the characters. In fact, hardly anyone of them is likable. Adrian Brody is no match for Schwarzenegger. The story falls flat : as the viewer already knows from the trailer that the gang is on a remote Alien planet, it still takes Adrian Brody and his friends 20 mins to figure that one out, which results in a snore fest for the audience. The movie has no real beginning and no real ending and therefore it feels a bit choppy and patchwork-like most of the time. Some good ideas don't make a good film.Action also only ho-hum, only one memorable scene at best. Soundtrack ripped off from Silvestri, nice to hear it again but it also makes you yearn for the 1987 original. Laurence Fishburn with a 10 min cameo that is more confusing than cool.All in all a low budget B-movie that neither the fans nor the world really needed.4/10",Predators
324,maveric1974,"It's OK, but it's definitely not a patch on the original",6,9 July 2010,"Good sequel, but it certainly isn't the 7.9 rating it has currently. I loved the original, could watch it again now and absolutely feel the tension and then love the carnage unleashed in the 2nd half of the movie. Predators does do justice to the original, in re-creating a tense first half as the group is hunted and toyed with..So, here are my thoughts. The acting, overall, is good, but some weak points..especially Topher Grace!! Useless! Laurence Fishburne, mate! What on earth happened? You used to be such a great actor..see Deep Cover, Boyz N the Hood..Brody, Braga and the others are good and believable. The Meican character played by Danny Trejo could as well have been non- existent..Why was he even in the movie, I don't know. Same with the African character...The action was good, but sporadic and the scene with the hunting dogs looked so fake..They should have paid more attention to creative hunting by the predators rather than using the arc with the dogs..I for one, hated that scene!The Predators and their cloaking wasn't explored enough. And Brody gets beat up by the Predator at the end and has no bruising, no broken bones at all and then gets up and finishes off the last Predator! Sorry, not believable. The original had Arnie using some ingenious methods to try and kill the Predator and even in the end, he actually blows himself up. Arnie's character knows he's lucky to survive. Predators has Braga and Brody surviving?!! Sorry, not plausible at all..For all their good work in the first 45 minutes, the second half was a copout. But's it's the studios running the show coz I guess they need a sequel, right? Would never have happened in the 80's where it was gritty and realistic. So, after all that, it's worth watching for re-creating memories of the original and listening to the music and seeing the Predators again but I came home and put on the original and then went to bed satisfied..Predator is still #1. The hallmark of a great movie? It still stands the test of time after many years and countless watchings and still seems believable..",Predators
325,shorvath55,I think it was a disappointing sequel after all.,3,9 November 2010,"I rented ""Predators."" As I wrote before, the first ""Predator"" was an original idea that worked really well, the sequel ""Predator 2"" brought the Alien creature closer to home in L.A., and the third, ""Alien vs Predator"" was again set far and away from Civilization. The fourth sequel was an entirely hideous garbage production! Here comes the fifth sequel, ""Predators"" based on a premise that is absurd because it is laughable! A group of men and a woman parachute onto a Planet as criminals whose punishments are to be dropped onto a strange Planet and survive against super Predators. First of all, Brody was the wrong choice as a lead actor. Topher Grace's role was absolutely unnecessary. Alice Braga's only role in the movie was so that another member of the group could comment on her ""awesome ass!"" My number 4 Vote is for the make-up of the Predators which were very well made with some distinguishing marks as to each one's different individuality, but there weren't any scenes in which one could distinguish the leader from a soldier amongst them? This, however, was seen in ""Predator 2"". I was really confused about Lawrence Fishburne's role who betrayed the group and I still don't know why? My other confusion came from Brody's belief: ""My enemy's enemy is my friend"", at which time he decided to free a Predator that's been chained to a pole. (This line came from AVP when Sanaa Lathan joined forces with a Predator to fight against the Aliens.) However, Brody nearly falls victim to the now freed Predator that betrayed him by blowing up the Spaceship that were supposed to take Brody back to Earth. In the closing sequence, there are Brody and Braga, the only 2 survivors, who now see more and more people parachuting onto the planet. As they began to walk into the Jungle and think out loud: ""How are we going to get off this Planet?"" I think this was a very cheesy remake combined with music from the first and reminiscing stories and quotes from the first and third Predator movies. All in all, I felt disappointed because I failed to see any excitement or real suspense of any kind. Even during the sequence when Brody ran around the Predator and beat it while in a circle of Fire, I failed to feel any excitement as if nothing special happened, until Brody picked up the Predator's hatchet and chopped the Predator's head off. I now wonder if there would be yet another sequel based on the premise of the 2 survivors who were left on that Planet from this film? We shall find out in the near future.",Predators
326,Zentaurion,"Take away the mask of nostalgia, and you see this is an ugly mother-...",5,13 July 2010,"I just got out of seeing this and feel very disappointed. If this movie had come out a year or two after the original, then fans would be decrying it as a cheap, rushed sequel to cash in on the original. It's bewildering to see how they got the same result after all these years. The problem with it is it's too much of a sequel. If these were videogames, then this movie could be termed a mission pack DLC. It brings nothing new and the only way you could enjoy it is you want to feel nostalgic about the first movie while keeping your brain switched off. There's so much they could have done to make it a movie of the same level as the original, but whether out of reverence, or being chickenpoop, they've chosen to just rehash everything you've seen in the original Predator.It's starts off very good and the characters are very well defined, with a solid cast. But they are not given enough to do, and only some sparse lines of camaraderie pass for character development and hence you don't get a feel for wanting to root for any of them to survive. Brody is solid with his role, but he is nothing to compare to Dutch. An Oscar wining actor, he is given nothing to do expect look hard. The rest of the cast is good too, but similarly wasted.What really comes out bad are the predators themselves. This is the first proper sequel to the original and the alien villains of this movie still have the same features and flaws as before. The whole movie is a waste of potential, and the predators themself are indicative of this.There are some very bad effects in one scene, and show what overall lacklustre effort went into it.Good for a one time viewing, but I don't see myself coming back to it in the same way as the original. It's definitely better than the AvP movies, but still not good enough.",Predators

328,Griever_2112,I think we've seen this before... but that isn't a bad thing.,7,14 April 2014,"This is by rights the 3rd movie in the Predator series. The story centers around a group of unknowns in a tropical jungle. They don't know why they are there, how they got there, or who each other are....As the movie progresses we are introduced to each character, an American Mercenary, an Israeli sniper, Russian Spetsnaz (Russian special forces), a Los Zetas cartel enforcer, an RUF Death Squad member, Death Row serial killer, Yakuza assassin, and a doctor...They come to find out they are on an alien world and that they are being hunted. Not by the Predators we think, no, they are being hunted by Predators on steroids (Now that is a scary concept) They must learn to survive or die one by one...Now I like that this is a ""proper"" Predator movie, and much better than the very forgettable AvP series. But I was disappointing in this movie for going to the well one too many times. The Spetsnaz was armed with a Minigun (a la Jesse Ventura, in the first movie) The events take place in a Jungle which you could have told me it was the same jungle from the first movie, and I would have believed you. The RUF member is fairly superstitious (a la Sonny Landham character)The music is spot on the soundtrack from the original movie. And Royce in the end does the Arnie mud cameo trick. A lot of it just felt like they took what everyone liked from the first movie, and tweaked it to look different but it felt like the first one. They even have Long Tall Sally as the closing credits. Now that is not necessarily bad, I loved the original movie, however I was hoping for more from this. Robert Rodriguez did a good job, I just wish he tried to make it more a stand out film then, retooling the first movie. In my opinion its a good viewing, definitely re-watchable, but as far as a good sequel goes, I think Predator 2 was a better follow up, due to the originality that made it different from the first.",Predators
329,the-timelord-victorious,This film is a Predator to itself...,3,8 July 2010,"I haven't really seen any of the original movies, so you could say that I'm quite new to the series. When the film started, I found it quite average, there's some beautiful cinematography, but that's about it. However, when we were introduced to the characters, and the first major action scene began, the film started to pick up. When the scene ended though, the whole film slowly began to go downhill again. There's some really good scenes in this, don't get me wrong. I loved Isabelle's comparison to the humans of earth being Predators to their own race, I thought that was a rather nice touch. The rest of the film though, is, to put politely, awful. It's littered with bad acting, and the actual Predators are laughable, who sound like wookies, to be honest.As well as being clichéd, we're also treated to 106 minutes of REALLY cheesy dialogue.Also, am I the only person who is getting really sick of profanity in films? It's just pointless, and wreaks of lazy writing and lack of imagination. There must have been countless uses of the F-word in there. It's stupid. The soundtrack is awful as well, so out of place and generic. When the credits rolled, I got up and looked up at the screen, and read ""Music by John Debney"" I just thought to myself ""Duh.

There could have develop so much more good stuff on this boneless screenplay, but it ended up with Mr. Simpson (sitting next to me in the theater) yawning and he kept saying:""Booooring, it's so boring. Stop boring everyone"" Finally, a film like this needs a much more Visual director in my opinion and a touch of sex and love would had made it more interesting too!",Predators

There were some minor holes and corny scenes in the movie, but nothing that ruined the film. I also had reservations about adrien brody playing the lead action star considering he doesn't look the part and was in the shadow of the iconic Arnold Schwarzenegger, but I must say that he did a great job. Everything came full circle in this movie and it added a depth to the Predator story that other films failed to do. This is definitely a movie worth checking out.",Predators

I loved the 'tie-in' to the original 'Predator' film and it made perfect sense. I see no reason to mention actor names specifically as they all performed very well in their roles. I will say that Topher Grace has been playing dirt bags in films recently and this was not an exception (watch 'Predators' yourself and figure it out!).

But this one is good Even though the title is predators the attention lies mostly on the survivors. Just as you hope in a predator movie. It has enough camp value to offer to it isn't a bad movie but it has that 90ties vibe going strong. It knows where it comes from and how people liked the first one. Now the ""lead"" is not as buff or as short as Swarzenegger yet still macho enough and short off enough to fit that role perfectly. There is the much loved mini gun :) this time in the hands of a Russian. Instead of an Indian we have a south American drugs cartel. Oh and to spice it up a jakuza. How utterly delicious! Yes and the CIA member is this women who is the second in lead.So being stranded on an alien plant in a well place where the wildlife and the predators hunt you. Oh have I spoken yet about the long term survivor they meet. Ah such a great vibe there. There are more predators they have most of their iconic weapons. They lay traps, the humans have to adapt fast, learn to hunt the predators as they themselves are hunted to survive.It is all you hope of a predator movie. This isn't a top class story. It shouldn't.. it must be 90's fun time. And that is what this movie does perfectly. It knows its tone it knows you want to just watch a movie and relax. And it offers you an almost perfect Predator 1987 vibe.I guess if I try hard enough I will find faults but I don't. I enjoyed this movie for being what it is a almost perfect 90ties vibe. Some people might say it isn't modern enough but I say really the first predators did it awesome. It doesn't needs to be made more modern. This modern version in a way is right where it should be.Yes there are a few additions. For instance instead of a team of battle harderened warriors who fought together for long. There are just one person from this, one person from that. Taken and this means that they indeed won't fully work together. Added inner fights and banter I can dig that! So get that popcorn, sit down and enjoy the show. Really and that is worth a 9 to me. It might not be ""the perfect"" movie but it is a movie that knows what it should be.It might not be Predator but for a modern take it is very close. What it adds are good things, enjoyable things. I stick with it in this time getting a decent 90ties movie back in this shape is pretty special. So watch it!",Predators
336,Strawberry_Typhoon,"Predators is the best film of the summer, and the Predator experience that fans have been begging for for decades.",8,11 July 2010,"Predator(1987) became such a cult phenomenon, that it spawned a sequel, two crossovers with the Alien Franchise, and a massive line of toys for both kids, and adults. The problem is, none of the following movies were any good. Sure, ""Predator 2"" gained a cult following, but there's a scene in the movie where an old lady smacks the predator with a broom as he runs through her apartment, so to me, it's a ""so bad it's good"" situation.""Preadators"" directed by Nimrod Antal, and produced by Robert Rodriguez, is a return to form for the franchise. It's more of a direct sequel to the original film than the sequel is, if that makes any sense. The events of the original film are referenced several times throughout the movie.We open to Royce, played by Adrien Brody, free falling through the sky while unconscious. Recovering from his hard landing in an unknown jungle, he starts discovering that he wasn't he only one tossed out of an airplane. Murderers and mercenaries literally start falling from the sky. A ragtag group of complete strangers, with only one thing in common, they are all killers in one way or another.The first act is spent mostly in a state of confusion. Not only is the audience confused as to what is going on, but so are the characters. Cautiously advancing through the strange jungle, they start to discover that they weren't the only people(things) dropped into this jungle. Empty cages, as well as skinned remains lead them to believe that they have been dropped here for a reason, to be hunted as game by somebody, or something.The first encounter with something other-worldly, is in a sequence where the crew is ambushed by a horde of strange canine like creatures. It is at this point that they actually realize they are being treated as game, in a reserve. Predators, releasing the hounds in order to get their prey on the run, and give them the upper hand. This is our first real treatment to the gun porn aspect of this movie, while our characters fire their respective weapons wildly into the pack of vicious beasts. Anyone who has spent any amount of time playing Modern Warfare 2 will quickly recognize Royce's gun, an AA-12, which is a fully automatic 12 gauge shotgun. The FX in this sequence are a decent blend of both CG, and practical splatter. The creature design is awesome, but not quite as jaw-dropping as Stan Winston's original design for the Predator.In a decision that could be viewed as either really smart, or supremely stupid, the group follows the ""dogs"" tracks back to what appears to be the Predators(plural) camp, we discover that there are different types of Predators present, and apparently, not all of them get along very well. Tied up in the camp is ""Classic Predator"" played by Derek Mears of ""Friday The 13th"" reboot fame.One of the main problems I see people having with the movie is Adrien Brody's performance. While I find it to be an effective performance, some are accusing him of trying to mimic Christian Bale's raspy whisper. While this is partially true I suppose, Brody plays a hardened merc like one would picture a hardened merc being. No complaints from me in this department. Another complaint I have heard is that, if Arnie couldn't stand toe to toe with the original Predator, how is it that scrawny Adrien Brody is able to do so in this sequel? Without giving too much away, I don't feel that this is the case. Brody doesn't have a knock down/drag out with the Predator, he actually just exploits one of the Predators only weaknesses.I've heard other complaints about the Jungle, and how it looks too earthly to be on another planet. These people aren't taking into consideration that this is sort of a hunting preserve. One of the first rules of hunting is to make your prey feel comfortable, so that they won't be expecting you when you make your move. Personally, I was glad to see straight up jungle, and not some ridiculously CG environment like that featured in ""Avatar"". It looks a lot better the way it is, trust me. It helps you connect the film to the original, and although it's a story about killer extra terrestrials hunting and slaughtering humans on another planet, it serves to keep the film as grounded in reality as possible.As mentioned before, the FX were a solid mixture of practical, and CG. The Predators, of course are still the classic rubber suit monsters that they've always been. Opting for a CG solution would have completely ruined the film. Derek Mears brings that same aggression to screen that he put forth in the F13 remake, and was quite menacing.Though not quite as tense as the first film, Predators manages to amp up the hunter/prey aspect this time around. In the first film, the rest of the team was done away with pretty fast, and you had the rest of the film filled with Arnie playing a game of cat and mouse with the predator. This time around, it's truly strength in numbers, as our mercs find ways to outsmart, and overpower the Predators that are tracking them down.In a summer full of bland family flicks, fake vampire films, and soulless cash-ins, Predators is the real deal. It's not a mindless popcorn flick, but it is fun as hell to watch. Predators is the best film of the summer, and the Predator experience that fans have been begging for for decades. If the AVP series left a bad taste in your mouth, be prepared to wash it out with the bloody good time that is ""Predators""8/10http://liberaldead.com",Predators
337,m0ds,What starts out good ends up naff,5,27 September 2010,"Predator being one of my favourite films this edition had a lot to live up to - and failed. For the first fifteen minutes I was engrossed, the use of the original music had my spine tingling and turned out to be the best bit for me, but that soon faded as the absurdity took over.By the end of the movie all the nice things that it started with were washed away, and it became just another pee-take of an old franchise.Only recently I watched Aliens vs Predator (the original) and I would probably rate that film higher and more worthy as a Predator sequel than this one. This movie was on par with Requiem - basically nonsense.The idea works well and the characters are okay, but none of them particularly thrilling and it's clear to see the original team (with Arnie) were a far more superior bunch of hard-men than any of the wimpy characters in Predators.The best bit of AvP for me was when a human and Predator worked together, and I was waiting for this to happen throughout Predators - and it does - very briefly at the end, but in no decent capacity as it was in AvP.Things began to fall apart for me when Predators went down the same road as Terminator 3 - taking the mick out of the original. For example, the scene with the Yakuza chap which was just a direct rip of Billy's death in the original. They obviously thought, ""Well, why didn't they show what Billy got up too in the original? I know, we'll include that fight in Predators"". They shouldn't have.Next was the bit with Brodey randomly walking back onto screen covered in mud and shouting ""Do it! Kill me! Do it now!"" - a complete and poor rip off of Arnie in the original. It was at that point where I started rolling my cigarette ready to leave, it was dumb, not needed and Brodey was awful doing it.I'd say if you're a hardcore fan of the original with little desire for the AvP films, Predators will disappoint. If you don't like the original but like the AvP movies a lot, you'll get a kick out of Predators.Verdict: Watch it when it's on TV, don't pay to see it and give the studios the impression we want more like this, cos I certainly don't. McTiernan should be the one to direct new Predator movies. Ack.",Predators
338,azimuth361,Contrast in Strengths and Weaknesses,5,15 May 2011,"There is an interesting contrast in strengths and weaknesses in the latest films in the franchise. There is no avoiding making comparisons, so I'll add my two cents.One weakness, and one that I find most annoying in most military-related films, is that theses so-called military elites have no idea of tactics, strategy, weapons discipline, or any sense of how to conduct small team operations. Please, please hire CPT Daly for the next film. He's good.One strength is in the character development. Although, it is foisted upon us in those tiresome soul-bearing scenes, at least we get a look into their motivations.One thing that the AVP movies had that was worth the cost of admission, at least for this viewer, was the fight scenes. I found the fight scenes between the Aliens and Predators really exciting, but the plots and the cast were crap. In this movie, the cast and plot was pretty good, but the fight scenes were crap. I mean come on, the fight in the field between the Yakuza and the wrist-blade wielding predator was about as exciting as 'My Dinner with Andre'. At the beginning of the scene, I actually said out loud, ""Ooh, this is going to be good."" When it ended, I said, ""What? What?!?! WHAT?!?!!?"" And in the final face-off, jump cuts do not a good fight scene make.On balance, it was the type of film I like, strong on characters, lots of ad-libs and quips that make the characters seem more natural and realistic. I also like the lines lifted from and the references to both to the Alien and Predator franchise. I also like that it's light on CGI. That technology should enhance a film, add color and flavor to a film. It should not BE the film. (Yeah, I hated Avatar) It's on about the same plane as Predator 1, maybe Alien 3, but nowhere near Alien or Aliens.",Predators
339,walterltjahnke,Brody does well,8,12 June 2019,Tough exterior but good heart - we'll done Royce/Brody. This is the perfect follow up to Predator as predator 2 sucked. I would've given it a 9 if Arnold came in. Good move to have a skinny guy compared to Arnold as the protagonist - I loved it. I wish there was a game good like this. Just two things I want to point out. Fishbourne should've been A good guy and lived and should've been Arnold. And two how did Brody know that mud disguises himself? But apart from this I loved the movie - great job.,Predators
340,cannonclubonline,Could have been 100 times better but failed to impress.,6,19 March 2011,"Without further ado, I'll have to say that I was quite disappointed with this film. I'm so glad that I didn't actually spend money on this in the theater. I would have probably walked out after the first 45 minutes. My major complaint about this film was the ridiculous dialog and the careless handling of the development of the characters in the film. The dialog was so simple and choppy, it didn't make much sense. Not to mention the fowl language and vulgarity from the character labeled as the death row inmate who said that he couldn't wait to get ""coked up and rape some women"".Leading the team is Adrien Brody, who as soldier of fortune, decides early on to be a loner, so he's not going to forge any emotional bonds with anyone, being quite dogged and determined to leave the gaming planet alive on his own.This of course irks Isabelle (Alice Braga), the female soldier from Israel who holds a few secrets of her own, and others from the likes of the Chechnyan soldier Nicolai (Oleg Taktarov) to the odd Dr. Edwin (Topher Grace), given the rest have tasted real life action in the killing fields, now brought by alien abduction to a planet whose atmosphere is almost identical to Earth, for a game of cat and mouse to test their survival skills.The most disappointing thing about the film was that the trailer leads you into thinking that their were perhaps more alien hunters by showing Adrian Brody being targeted by a large number of 3 point laser cannons when, in the film it only shows about two.The highlight of the film was when Laurence Fishburne materialized in an Alien invisibility suit. I thought, wow, this film is getting ready to go somewhere, but he just decided to take a nap and then slipped out the back and started a fire around the party to steal their weapons. What a poor way to use someone with such talent in a first rate film for ten minutes.If that's not enough to convince you to skip ahead to the action scene, then find the spot where they spend two minutes watching the entire cast climb though a door one by one. What's really confusing and disappointing is when they suddenly start talking about the fact that ""They see our traps."" What? What traps? Did you see them make any traps? No, but I did spend 2 minutes watching the entire cast climb through a door. If you start watching the movie and you start getting that feeling like 'Hmmm, now wait a minute. This is just terrible, it's like the feeling when you get when you buy a lemon at the car dealership. They call that cognitive dissonance. You keep saying to yourself ""Nah, I'm sure it will get better."" I suggest you trust your instincts on this one, and if you have to see it for yourself, make sure that you have an exit strategy. This was an Epic failure for me.I'm extremely happy for Adrian Brody, who actually looked pretty buff in this film, probably thanks to working out in a weight lifting facility. I was constantly reminded how stupid it was to have this Doctor Edwin character played by Topher Grace tagging along with no gun and being the off planet expert botanist. So what did I miss when he decided to turn evil and slice Isabelle (Alice Braga) with a poisonous pocket knife? Were we supposed to believe that this little twerp was in cahoots with the predator creatures? Another unanswered question was why was the predator chained to the stone? Why did he blow up his own space ship? If the film was supposed to be different from the first, then why did they steal lines from 1987?",Predators
341,deathscythe_42,"A fun action flick, but overall a disappointment",5,9 July 2010,"I went into this movie really excited to a see a sweet action movie, and hoping that it would also deliver some of the tension and suspenseful build-up that made the first installment so strong. Well, I will say that while it had its moments of excitement, and was overall a fun movie, it fell pretty short of my hopes and expectations.Despite my anticipation, I felt a negative reaction to this movie almost immediately when it started rolling. It's like I knew as soon as the title hit the screen that I was not going to enjoy this movie nearly as much as I expected. The reason is because the film has very little exposition, and what is there is a mess. Imagine if a couple of screenwriters get together, and come up with a very vague idea for a movie. They say ""hey, let's take a handful of people, drop them into a jungle on a foreign planet, and then have them get attacked by aliens."" Then instead of fleshing the story out and adding some depth, they start filming the movie right then and there, but not only that, they take that outline completely, one hundred percent literally. I won't put any spoilers but two minutes into the movie you will know exactly what I mean by that.Now not every single movie has to have a ton of back-story to make it good, a simple premise like that can be scripted and shot effectively, but the point is that I did not care about these characters at all, and rather than being enticed by their dilemma, I found myself waiting impatiently for them to try to sort things out so that the action could start. On top of that, the characters and the script were both very cliché and not very interesting. I usually try my best to stay quiet during movies but I almost couldn't help making off-handed comments to break the monotony, and neither could some of the other viewers. One of my friends summed up my feelings at that moment pretty well when he said fairly loudly ""This is going to be a long movie..."" As it turned out, it picked up a significant amount of momentum as the movie went on. Ninety percent of this movies problems come from the screen writing. The technical aspects are actually pretty solid. By that I mean it has enjoyable action sequences with pretty good special effects. I wouldn't exactly call it a top notch actioner, but it had a lot of exciting moments. At first it seemed like it was just going to be a lot of walking and arguing leapfrogged in between ""RUN! SHOOT!"" over and over again, but during the middle it built up some solid tension and suspense. It didn't quite have me on the edge of my seat like I hoped, but I can honestly say I did feel pulled into some of the scenes later on. It also has some satisfying violent moments for blood and gore lovers.The other main flaw of the movie is that it mimics the first one a little too much, and not to as great of an effect. Despite some obvious differences, it seemed to follow a pretty similar formula, and while some of it was clearly meant to be viewed as homage, I saw a lot of it as a cop out.My final verdict is that this movie is quite enjoyable visually, but it was clearly written with the intention of playing off of the original's success and Hollywood's clichés. The script is mostly laughable, but it has some well done moments. If you aren't very stingy with your money I would say it's worth seeing in the theater for the action elements, but if you prefer to be more selective with your movies I will recommend you pass this one up. *****----- 5/10",Predators
342,crazy-ben66,Surprisingly good fun,8,13 July 2010,"When I first heard that a new Predator film was to be made, my mind instantly shot to an AVP3 scenario, which, let's face it, would have been bloody awful. Instead though, Robert Rodriguez comes forward with an interesting, all-be-it slightly recycled idea for a mighty fine stand-alone Predator project. He throws the directing credits over to unknown Nimrod Antal and sets to work re-writing his original 1994 script. The product is a mighty fine piece of work with so many references to the original (the 1987 classic, NOT the '91 sequel or either of the truly awful AVP attempts) that a Predator fan-boy would soil himself instantly. The plot revolves around 8 people dropped into a jungle, all from different places (Mercenary, Yakuza, Russian Military, Doctor, Death Row Inmate) forced to play a cat-and-mouse game with the savage alien beasts that are the Predators. The opening hour appears in a rather tiresome format (action, story, action, story) and much like the '87 classic, the action consists of basically shoot everything in sight, doesn't matter if it moves or not. This is fine for action fans and those looking for a bit of fun on a Saturday afternoon but it really lacks any mythology or depth that the '87 film hinted at. However, this all changes when Noland turns up, a slightly mental former soldier who's been living amongst the Predators, surviving on scraps for, in his words, ""10 seasons"". It is then that the whole story begins to unfold and we learn why these random killers (minus the Doc) have been imprisoned on this random planet. The story is not too detailed, but provides just enough to silence fan-boys. The acting is mostly good, with Adrien Brody providing a strange but believable performance as the big cheese mercenary who acts as the leader of the group. Laurence Fishburne also puts in a solid performance as the mentally scarred Noland and unknown former star of The Shield, Walton Goggins provides a good humorous tone for most of the film. The real emotion lies with Oleg Taktarov's brutal-but-sweet Russian solider Nikolai though, not sure why. Predators manages to play great homage to Predator in particular, but also the '80s, at one point bizarrely, even quoting 'Scarface'. A solid effort that will be remembered as a genuinely great sequel to a genuinely great action flick. I recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind the odd spot of blood and isn't looking for too much of a story. 8/10",Predators
343,frenchmonkeys,Disappointment Factor: 10,3,10 July 2010,"It seems to me that anyone watching this will probably have already seen the original 1987 Predator starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, and probably most of the other movies featuring the predator race. If that's true, then you've nothing to gain by seeing this - those who suggest it's new material must have seen a different movie.In the previews, a big deal is made about how this film is different - new super predators, multiple alien species, takes place on an alien planet, etc. Sadly, the differences are actually minimal, and this is simply a study in plagiarism.Largely military personnel are cut down by a group of predators. Sorry, super predators. You can tell the difference because they're a few inches taller, have bigger teeth, and their shoulder mounted canons have a different special effect. Should have spotted that.They're in a jungle. Oh, but not an earth jungle (despite one character recognising and naming the plant life from his knowledge of Earth based plants - incidentally, allegedly a doctor, not a botanist, which is a curiosity in itself).When you add to this mix one female member of the group to match the mix in the original, the predator whispers from the first movie (not used in a similar way, the same words, which the predator copied from hearing Mac say them in the first movie, but are not spoken by humans in this one...), the same lines being delivered by the main characters as Arnie used, precise duplications of specific camera shots, similar traps as Arnie made towards the end of the first movie, and a final battle between a mud covered human and the last remaining predator, and so on, and so forth.Yes, there are some differences. For instance, the action starts almost right away, with no chance to meet the main characters and know anything about them as happens in the first, they are just thrown into the action and left to fend for themselves, with nothing but some crap dialogue and, oh, magically, a similar assortment of weapons as Arnie's team.I watched aghast as the characters are slaughtered one by one. Not because I cared about them, but because so much more could have been done with them before they're offed. The Russian spetsnaz guy, elite special forces, probably the toughest, best trained special forces personnel in the world, is shown to be a trigger happy moron. I know it's an American movie and they have to show US forces as the be all end all of the world's fighting men, but please, this is ridiculous. The yakuza finds an old samurai blade to wield (and uses one of his few lines as a copy of one in Predator 2 commenting that they've been doing this a while) - convenient that the only old fashioned weapon there was just what he was proficient in using, don't you think. And what does he get to do with it? Anybody else seen Seven Samurai? Yep, plagiarism again as he uses it to duel with the predator, having stayed behind to fight him - just like Billy from the first movie, amazingly enough.I would give this movie one star for it's weak story, weak script, poor acting and unashamed duplication of other films if it wasn't for a great performance from Laurence Fishburne which was sadly far too short, and again, his character was utterly wasted. Still, his few minutes of screen time lift my vote to three stars... albeit grudgingly.I expected more of a movie with Robert Rodriguez pulling the strings even if it was Hungarian director Nimrod Antal at the helm. I even fell into that old Hollywood hype trap and expected at least halfway decent entertainment for my money having seen the trailer - but the most promising scene in the trailer, where the protagonist is lit up by multiple red dot sights from shoulder canons doesn't actually appear in the film at all.If you want more predator action in your life, go rent the original again - it may be dated and a bit cheesy in places, but it's a far better way to spend your money, even if you have already seen it many times over.",Predators
344,jwchoo1,Predators: BeatDown Reviews,8,10 July 2010,"Okay I am going to start off this review by saying that this film is by far the best monster movie I have seen in a long time. Yes I have been a Predator fan for many years now and the crossovers between the Predator and Alien movies were just crap. Yes I do think the Alien movies were very intriguing but I am just a bigger fan of the Predators. Firstly, this film is not a remake or a reboot of the franchise but a sequel to the first and second film. Secondly, Robert Rodriguez was the producer of this film which means it is definitely going to be gory. And thankfully it is.The film starts off by showing us Royce(Adrien Brody)a mercenary falling from the sky while waking up. He manages to pen up his chute in time before crashing into the alien jungle. He soon meets up with several other characters Isabelle(Alice Braga) a black ops sniper,Cuchillio(Danny Trejo) a drug cartel enforcer,Edwin(Topher Grace) a surgeon,Mombasa(Mahershalalhashbaz Ali) a death squad officer,Nikolai(Oleg Taktarov) a Russian commando,Stans(Water Goggins) a deadly death row inmate and Hanzo(Louis Ozawa Changchien)a yakuza assassin.Soon the survivors find that the are being stalked by the Predators and have to find a way to defeat them and staying alive while doing so.I will stop spoiling the story hear as you will just have to watch the movie to find out what happens next.Okay story wise it is actually very fresh and I have not thought off an idea like this before. The idea of having the Predators having a planet where they drop the best killers on earth on their planet where they hunt for fun is actually very exciting to see come alive on the big screen. The cast is just brilliant and acting is pretty darn good. Adrien Brody packed on 25 pounds of muscle for his role. This just shows you how committed he was to his film.The director Nimrod Antal(he also directed Vacancy and Armoured) is just brilliant. He knows what he is doing when he is directing the cast. The locations were shot on Hawaii and Robert Rodriguez's very own Trouble Makers Studio so he could have creative control over the film.Now lets move on to the Predators. The have added three new types Predators to the movie. The Black-super-Predator/JawBone Predator,Falconer Predator and the Flusher Predator. They have also brought back the ""original"" Predator from the first film. I loved the new masks on the predators and their names really come from what they do. You'll know what I mean once you watch the film.Well that about wraps up this movie review, I give it an 8/10 for good acting,directing and a great new chapter in the Predator franchise.",Predators

It's short and simple... it's Predators not The Piano.They definitely ramped up the CGI and visual effects in this one. From the opening sequence free falling to the planet surface to the final battles... OUTSTANDING! I must say relocating the story line to an alien planet really set them free from earthly constraints and let them use their imaginations a little bit.Adrian Brody puts on a very good performance and in a new role as a action hero... played the part very well and it suits him... lets hope he is given the opportunity again.One disappointment was the character played by Laurence Fishburn. I thought they could have let the character play along a little bit longer in their quest for survival. Given Fishburn's credentials I thought it a bit of a waste.This franchise has shown itself to still be viable and deliver up the explosions.

346,PopcornJury,Predators is a terribly mediocre game of cat and mouse that brings down a franchise solely built around the acting chops of Arnold Schwarzenegger.,4,29 November 2010,"The original Predator was an awesome movie. Not because of the special effects or the storyline, or the character development. It was awesome because of the action, with a little help from Arnold of course. The new Predators film is pretty awful. It's about a group of killers dropped on an island to act as prey for a group of three Predators. It's as simple as that, a game of cat and mouse. In order to get off the island, the group of seven humans must band together and destroy the three Predators. It sounds promising, but it's actually very poorly executed.Let's look at the characters. We've got Adrien Brody as the lead mercenary. He's brought to the island because of his tracking, hunting, and killing experience. He's horrible in this role, although I'm a bit prejudice because I don't really like him as an actor (see Splice) plus no one can live up to Arnold's role in the original. As for everyone else, I could name names, but you wouldn't know any of them (other than Topher Grace, the dorky kid from Win a Date with Tad Hamilton). Don't worry, even he is completely disposable. We also see an ex-con, a few military men, and a Yakuza mafia member with some pretty cool sword-fighting skills. Why is everyone on the island skilled with some sort of combat experience? Because the Predators want a challenge.Predators doesn't really succeed on many levels. If you go into it knowing the plot and understanding what will come out of it, you will still be disappointed, but it could be a lot worse if you're expecting anything positive to come out of the film. It's a complete popcorn flick for men who haven't had enough of the Predator franchise just yet and yearned for an update to the series. Is it worth a rental? No. But I wouldn't be opposed to recommending it on cable in a few months.Predators is totally mediocre, maybe even less than. If you know and understand that, do what you will at the Redbox.

It really could have been a great one, if only the script had been written with much more simplicity. Because, it has some quality : the photography is superb, and the predators are really something! Really awesome! But, as for me, two things are really missed, two things that I am attached to : the script is stupid, and the character are as uninteresting as possible. First, you feel like watching a bad episode of ""Lost"", then, after the classical presentation of the character, it is just being boring, one or two action scenes, then you can sleep till the end. Secondly, I really like Adrian Brody, but I really felt like slapping his character in the movie : a sort of mix between a skinny Rambo, and a pretentious Sherlock Holmes. Grrrrr, my god, how did he know so well everything? Had he read the script between his fall and his awakening? Also, the other character really lack interest. Some are just bad, but you don't feel like liking them, the others you just don't care. No Bill (1987's Predator), no one attaching or funny or anything... It's all a mess, till the end that is (I don't know why), suddenly interesting, and funny (if you except some king of crappy twist-plot...)

Predators are mysterious, advanced badasses and to reveal too much would spoil their mystery. The serial killer twist actually suprised me as well. Fun movie that had me caring how Brody's character would make it off that planet. Brody was convincing as a badass himself.

352,LaserPoint,Slightly disappointing but still entertaining,7,7 July 2010,"Predators, on paper, is the true sequel fans have been waiting for. First things first; we're back to a jungle-like location, which IMO is where the Predator belongs. The classic breed (from the first and second films) plays a extensive part, the traditional score from the original '87 film is back and we have ourselves a very simple plot that doesn't try to take itself to seriously which was one of the many faults with 2004's AVP. Now one of the weakest elements about Predators is the obvious poor writing. The characters lead by Adrien Brody as Royce, Alice Braga as Isabelle, Topher Grace as Edwin and Oleg Taktarov as Nikolai were given little screen time to development, and along with the weak dialog provided it at times felt like a cheaply executed B-Movie; which was the tag line they were desperately trying to avoid after 2007's AVP.R. The story moves along at a relatively fast rate as the group of elite hunter find out that there located on a gaming preserve planet, where the Predators hunt them down as sport for trophy's and ranking points. The new Predator designs are a highlight, and the action scenes were very well handled, with CGI only used as a enhancement tool making everything else like the sets, the make-up and the costumes very physical and organic. The homages were definitely full on, which to be honest I found quite annoying seeing as it seemed to be acting as a remake or re-imagery rather then a sequel. Overall, I'd say Predators is properly the second best film in the franchise even though it wasn't near as good as I expected it to be.

Nothing in the remainder of the movie contradicted this. The storyline very quickly becomes obvious and, unfortunately, cliché. The idea has been done before and a majority of the characters (exception of perhaps three) delivered ridiculously over-informative lines in lieu of real character development. A few potentially significant introductions in the film were left disappointingly unexplored. The technology of the Predators had not substantially changed since the first Predator - yet another missed opportunity. The fight scenes as well were largely devoid of creativity or originality. I was pleased to find the movie still enjoyable despite all the detractions. It was more poorly developed and thought through than the original but approached Predator 1 quality. I do not, however, think it was overly demanding of me to expect newer and better of a sequel that had 23 years to develop. This movie was about 5% Science Fiction, 10% Drama, and 85% Good ole' Action. If you are a Predator fan I recommend the viewing but be prepared for the worst (and then be a tad bit pleased).

Whereas Alien has dabbed in odd semi-prequels, the Predator's second wind quickly resulted in a full-on new installment, two decades after its last solo outing.Predators, its pluralized title a wink at the second film of the Alien series the Predator is now intractably connected with, is a fresh start in many ways. None of the principals from the previous two films return, and the events of the moody 1987 original are only mentioned in passing (thank goodness it isn't a reboot - I'm a continuity freak and love long-running timelines). An assorted bunch of mercenaries, gang members and soldiers finds itself abducted by aliens and brought to a surprisingly Earth-like alien planet that acts as a game preserve. There, they quickly find themselves hunted by the Predators we all know and love. Since each Predator installment has an all-new cast, we know more about the creatures than the protagonists do, and observe them discovering things we already know in the first act. This isn't to say Predators has nothing new to offer. First off, these Predators use alien bloodhounds to corral their prey, a nice addition to the Predator creature being an analogy of a big game hunter. Also, we're on an alien planet, so we get to see some of their other quarry - not Xenomorphs, but mysterious eyeless creatures whose design will be instantly recognized by die-hard Predator nerds as the rejected design from the original film. A nice easter egg, indeed. Finally, there is an addition where the film went a little off the reservation in my opinion: the 'Predators hunting Predators'. While this is a nice nod to the 'blood feuds' of the expanded universe comics, the Predators fighting amongst themselves makes them seem less threatening to the protagonists. Especially when they decide to aid one of the two Predator factions in a move that will surely bring back memories of the much-maligned 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend' from the first AVP. The fact that the main Predator antagonists, so-called 'Super Predators', look wholly over the top once their face masks are removed, doesn't help this. It's a small consolation that the Predator helped by the humans is a fantastic recreation of the original 1987 design, whose presence tells us that the film isn't completely revamping the titular creature's look but simply introducing different Predator races. Still, it feels as something of an insult that the 'classic Predator' is reduced to being the prey of bigger, badder Predators. Is this the same creature that gave Arnold such a hard time? While characterization has never been the series' strength, we are treated to a varied bunch of characters this time around, among them a Mexican cartel member, a Russian Spetsnaz fighter and a Yakuza member. Given the Predators' penchant for sport, it's no surprise why they cherry picked some of the nastiest, most brutal inhabitants of Earth and threw them all together into a genocidal version of the Expendables. The plural 'Predators' refers as much to the human cast as their alien hunters. Everyone is given their own little backstory, which fairly easily sets them apart from their wildly different compadres. Adrien Brody, not the most logical actor to follow after Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny Glover, surprises as a merciless mercenary with the meanest growl since Clint Eastwood told those gang members to get off his lawn. Walton Goggins plays a deliciously creepy death row inmate, Alice Braga shines as a toughened-up version of the Anna character from the original and Danny Trejo is, well, Danny Trejo. There's also a fun role for Laurence Fishburne as an Air Force soldier who's been trapped on the planet for years, has learned to hide from the Predators using their own technology and has become a little, well, 'weird'. While not terribly original - another jungle, another bunch of souped-up humans being picked off one by one - Predators feels very sure of itself and, despite going off the rails with some unneeded Predator-on-Predator violence, seems to understand what made the original tick. It shamelessly recycles much of Alan Silvestri's score (which is just fine by me) and doesn't lose itself in CGI - yes, there's CGI in the film (the hounds, some Predator weaponry), but much of the Predator action features old-fashioned men in suits. We are even treated to the return of Long Tall Sally. All in all, it's a welcome return for one of cinema's most iconic monsters.",Predators
355,Skynet-TX,Not bad for a human :),7,21 December 2010,"I've seen this movie lately and I have to tell that it was better than I expected. I liked the idea of the predators' dogs and the different kind of predators - like dogs and wolves - hunting each other. But maybe they should be called different kind of ""Hunters"". Of course there were some scene that could have been made better: the killing of Noland, who managed to survive many hunting seasons before, the fight of the predators and the ""narrating"" scenes of Royce. If the predator in the first movie killed all people of Dutch, this team should have been killed within, let's say, 20 minutes. Including the arrival. What were the predators waiting for when they found the prey? How could they imitate Cuchillo's voice asking for help if he never asked for help? Remember, in original movies the predator was only able to repeat what he have heard earlier. But not counting these mistakes, the movie (the actions) is pretty good.",Predators
356,SilensMortea,Worth waiting for,8,8 July 2010,"I am, and always have been, a fan of the Predator series. I even liked AVP, though not AVP 2. One thing that has always bothered me was that you never see too much of the Predators (or not enough, in my humble opinion). In this film, however, we see plenty of them. There are different kinds of Predators as well, and we are also treated to seeing the original Predator design, along with the new ones. There are also some well-timed jumps and a pretty nice twist or two.The beginning of the film did remind me of the Saw and the Cube series, in that you find a group of people together with no one knowing how or where they are, or for what purpose. I had a lot of trouble with the accents in this movie as well, which is why I didn't rate it higher. I'm just waiting for the DVD so I can read the subtitles and figure out what I missed! There are a few genuinely creepy moments in the beginning of the movie, and some nice blood effects.It really was great to see the Predators back and up to their old tricks. There's nothing quite like the moment when you see one stand up and remove their invisibility, and then behind him is another...and another...All massive and oh-so-impressive to look at.I had no problem with Adrian Brody in his part; although I'm not used to seeing him play such a tough-guy character, I feel he did very well. Topher Grace, on the other hand, I just saw as Eric Foreman, from ""That 70's Show"". I've seen him in ""Spiderman"", of course, and did not like the character he played in that, or in ""Win a date with Tad Hamilton"". It just wasn't him. In Predators, he is very similar to his usual self from ""That 70's show"" that it made him very likable and funny at times. He more fits the gangly dork than anything else, so if you liked him in the TV show, you'll like him here (though seeing him as a Doctor and hearing him spout medical terms definitely wasn't believable). Laurence Fishburne plays a very creepy survivor. The other actors didn't stand out too much to me, but all in all the acting was very top-notch, the story solid, and the effects great. I highly suggest you watch this film if you at all are a fan of the Predators series.",Predators
357,doctorjagger,"Awesome, a worthy sequel",10,16 July 2010,"This movie was awesome from start to finish. It wasn't as good as the original, but then what sequels that come years later ever are? It was better than Predator 2 (which had a lot of standstill moments with the main character yelling at people cause they wouldn't let him do his job), and it is much better than the AVP drivel. The acting in this movie was all great. The CGI wasn't overdone. People who say this is too much like the original are wrong. They have some of the same kind of props, like one of the weapons is the same. But the plot and all of the scenes are totally different. I was very impressed by all of the ""Predator vision"" shots. People who say the Predators where too easy to kill, unlike the one in the original, need to consider that if they where that tough the humans would die in the first twenty minutes, seeing as there are many more Predators in this one. Compare Alien to Aliens. The Aliens where much easier to kill than the one in the first one. But in this one they did things that where different. Like they where willing to sacrifice themselves to kill the Predators. They never caught the Predator in a direct explosion in the original like they did here. It was always near but not spot on to the Predator in the first movie. I love how brutally tough the Predators where when fighting hand to hand. As an entry to the series I give this a 7.5/10 Conservatively I give this movie an 8/10 Being generous I give it a 10/10",Predators
358,pcongleton-1,From the fake moons/planets in the daytime sky to Mr. Fishburn's ridiculous character this one was a let-down.,7,15 July 2010,"The original Predator films were fun because they gave us the unique perspective of seeing man as the hunted. Man is supposed to be the most superior beings on earth until these guys showed up. Then, as we moved into the ""AVP"" era of the Predator movies franchise we got to see the Predators take on someone more their size with the Alien creatures. This time we go to the Predator's place. In the Arnold Schwarzenegger/Danny Glover roll this time is Adrian Brody who under protest is the leader of a group of soldiers/mercenaries/killers who are just trying to keep themselves from getting killed. I can't say too much about his character but hats off to the excellent work of Topher Grace in this film. His part in this film is the only part that gives this film any credibility and saves it from being a total joke, which brings me to Laurence Fishburne. His character is useless in this movie. He plays a crazy survivor who has managed to survive on this planet for 10 years – yeah right. The special effects work fine and so do the stunts. What kills this one for me, and I have said it a million times before, but no matter what your story/genre is all about, you still have to make it believable and this one takes way too many liberties with the reality factor. From the fake moons/planets in the daytime sky to Mr. Fishburn's ridiculous character this one was a let-down.",Predators
359,sidekicknick43,Bring on Predator 4,9,10 July 2010,"Alright, I'll let you know my opinion of the other films before I get to this one. 1ST PREDATOR, I'll just say it: awesome. Do I need to say more than that? 2n: Dumb, poorly acted in some parts, but the second half was pretty kick ass. The 2 AVP films: I'm one of few people who liked the first one, albeit aware of his flaws. The second one is nothing more than a B movie and is only good for blood and gore.Now we have PREDATORS. And let me just say that my hat is off to Mr. Rodriguez for helping to create this. It is truly the Predator film we have been waiting for. It's well acted, the action is affective, the PREDATORS are more bad ass than ever, and the film actually explores the predator world more than the other films. All of the characters are likable at one time or another, and I actually felt sorry for a few of them when they died. You really don't know where they're going to go with any of the characters that last through more than the first act. There was a time where I thought they could have killed off just about anyone. Co-Host said there weren't any really good action scenes, but I have to disagree with him entirely. Every time I started to get bored, either a good action scene would reel me back in, or it would be a character saying or doing something unexpected.The only gripes I have with the film involve small things such as underused actors like Trejo and Fishburn. You could have put anybody in those roles, why spend so much on actors that would only have five to ten minutes of screen time? The audience I was with actually clapped when Fishburn showed up, and I heard a noticeable ""aww"" noise when he died. My next problem involves the effects- not very good. Especially when the Predators would go to and from ""invisible mode"". Though, this also brings up a good point, which is that they didn't use too much unnecessary CG. Last gripes I have involve a Predator on Predator fight. They mostly tackle each other the whole time and I thought they could have done so much more.Overall, it has some noticeable flaws. But, the fact that those flaws are restricted to one specific part of the film rather than something that drags on through the film makes it a very watchable film",Predators

He was even beyond any kind of criticism. But in the role of a battle-hardened soldier? Give me a break... The whole movie feels weak. The cast is good, and so is the picture. But the scenario, the lack of tension, the relentless feeling of watching a movie with no beginning and no end put together just for the sake of showing the Predator... all of these things are pretty tiring. In a nutshell, it is clear that whoever was being that movie had been assigned a single, crystal-clear objective: make as much money on the franchise as possible. With the potential side-effect of sending the whole Predator sequence straight to the trash can. Are we there yet? Well, we're close...",Predators
361,micahbosarge,"not much plot, but still is ONE HELL of a movie",9,6 July 2010,"going into this movie i had a lot of hope knowing that Robert Rodriguez was producing Predators because he is the man behind wonderful movies like (Sin city,planet terror,the Mexican trilogy,and from dusk to dawn,) i was a little disappointed he wasn't directing this but Nimrod Antal is a OK choice i enjoyed vacancy and Armored but neither of those are sci-fi, Vacancy is a suspense thriller and Armored is a action thriller so i was curious of the direction he was going to take, sense i seen the movie yesterday my expectations going into the movie was exceeded in every way except one, no Arnold Schwarzenegger besides that it was amazing the horror and gore is finally back to the predator franchise. Predators made avp and avpr look like a bad Nintendo 64 video game, don't get me wrong avp and avpr are OK movies if you are a teen or have never seen the first two predator or alien movies but if you are a fan of the original predator movie or alien movie your mind can't imagine a pg-13 predator movie or alien movie, Predators didn't tailor or edit the movie for a teenager crowed or church group like avp did, Robert Rodriguez and Nimrod Antal took the concept of the original 2 movies and made predators similar to John Mctiernan's predator movie but its not remake or a copy its not even a sequel its more of a refresh to the franchise and to show new environments and situations for the audience to experience. the idea for predators to kidnap the deadliest humans on earth and bring them to their planet to hunt was genius so all in all i give predators 9 out 10. p.s this is a very gory frightening movie i wouldn't recommend bringing any body under 17 to see this movie with out them knowing it is rated R for (strong creature violence,gore,and pervasive language)",Predators
362,meanmaan,Adrien Brody is a great actor but,2,4 November 2010,"2/10 I saw the original 1987 Predator starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, and kinda like it. I think you've nothing to gain by seeing this - even (after 23 years) with new material and effects. In the previews, a big deal is made about how this film is different but in the movie the differences are actually minimal and not worth a damn. The personalize of characters is so bad and simple, The film's plot is awful. I wont go into it, The cast is a funny joke!!! What the heck casting directors really felt? that replacing 80's action heroes with a bunch of razor-thins!! Adrien Brody is a great actor (The Pianist, Hollywoodland, Cadillac Records, The Village) but not a very convincing lead in this one. It's absolutely not his type, He's rough and stubborn but not an action hero! From this director (Nimród Antal) I watched Vacancy (2007) and Armored (2009) and I hated both, now it's 3!! But I didn't watched Control (2003) which I heard good things about. One of the producers is Robert Rodriguez...aaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh What the hell is going wrong with u man?

Some of the humour/ dialogue is distasteful.
The cast is good overall.
However, I think that a surprise appearance by a famous actor, was miscast or at least unprepared for role. He was too fat for the situation his character found himself in. He should have lost 15lbs at least...other actors with greater commitment would have lost far more to be believeable.",Predators

Watch it!This film features a fantastic cast that was meant for the ""edge-of-your- seat"" action. This film could definitely be listed in any lists of top movies of all times simply due how it makes an audience feel like they are right there in the ""arena"" with a machete wielding Danny Trejo. I will say again that this film is by far the best in the franchise and I do not think anything can beat its stunningly perfect storyline and complete honesty in terms of keeping with the other films and not altering any basic facts.

The story line is pretty good and its far more interesting then predator 2 or the avp series. I am going to have to agree with the LA times because their reviewer said the first hour is really good and then it starts to lag. If you love the first movie you will like this movie but should not love it. It has way too many homages to the first one and a hell of a lot more plot holes. The movie is fun, entertaining, and it should accomplish its goal by re-energizing people to the dead franchise. My biggest complaint was the homages to the original.

367,jymwrite-1,Welcome Back to the Jungle,7,9 July 2010,"""Predators"" is back to basics return for the ""Predator"" franchise, they have juggled the elements that made the first film successful but couldn't seem to get right for the sequel or the ""Alien vs. Predator"" movies. ""Predators"" starts with the original premise of the first movie. Eight people of different ethnicities (if not occupations) are thrown into a living green hell of a jungle except they all don't know how they got there or where they are. The only thing they're sure of is that they were involved in some war, they saw a light and the next thing they remember is waking up as they fell into the jungle.As the eight get to know each and their surroundings, ""Predators"" relies on the camaraderie of the individuals and the stress of the situation for each character to reveal themselves to each other and the audience, and they discover every one may not be what they seem. There's also a nice bit of gallows humor to lighten the moments and was one of the things that gave the original ""Predator"" some of it's charm.The predators have some new toys including the spiky dogs, and we learn there are two different kinds of predators, the standard one we're used to seeing is the smaller of the species and are hunted by the larger super-predator when no other game is available.One bit of casting I was worried about was Topher Grace, the geeky Eric Forman of ""That 70's Show,"" he seemed miscast or ill fitted for Eddie Brock in ""Spiderman 3,"" and here he's the one element that doesn't fit, but he isn't supposed to, and he looks right for the part and delivers a role that at first looks like a straightforward but has some twists. Laurence Fishburne does a near-cameo as Noland, a soldier marooned on the planet and who may be from the Vietnam era, I think he hums a bit of Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" used to such great effect in Apocalypse Now.I at first thought ""Predators"" was directed by Robert Rodriquez and that was one of the reasons I was looking forward to seeing the movie. I was a little disappointed that Rodriquez only produces, but this movie does incorporate some of the feel of a movie directed by Rodriquez but that may be because ""Predators"" is based on a screenplay Rodriguez wrote sixteen years ago . Directing is Nimrod Antal and he moves the movie tautly along never veering off course or too far off course, and he does add some visual artistry that hasn't been seen in any of the previous movies but gives us a sense of the alieness of the world the characters find themselves trapped on.""Predators"" is conscious of the events of the first ""Predator"" movie and the climatic battle is a tweaked version that is an homage to Arnold's battling of the predator while building on some of the inferred weaknesses of the predators. ""Predators"" is a good telling of a ""Predator"" story, using bits of the original and adding its own devices to the ""Predator"" mythology.",Predators
368,dave-930-756001,Watch the original instead..,2,10 February 2011,"I give this a very generous 2, it gets 2 points just because the special effects were reasonably good. The rest, just a blatant copy of the original film, similar characters, similar weapons, which just makes you think you've seen it all before. Some of the characters even manage to get killed in similar circumstances. If you've seen the original film, and want to watch something almost identical with even worse acting, then this is the film for you. I will be brief with the review, as I actually went to sleep 40 minutes into it. The last hour might have been amazing, I will never no, I have no intention of watching the rest.

370,carmmm4,I have not seen the first two Predator movies...,6,8 February 2011,"My only experience with Predator has been through AvP and the only reason I saw that movie was because I was a big fan of the Alien franchise. Predators was intended to be a sequel only to the original Predator movies and I think they succeeded in distancing themselves from AvP.I was concerned that I would not enjoy this movie since I haven't seen the rest of the franchise. However, I still found this to be a decent action flick. There is just enough fighting and backstabbing among the characters to move the plot forward and although the movie's reveals and ending are not hard to predict, they are still neat to watch unfold.I only rated this movie a 6 for a few reasons. One, there is a scene of pretty unnecessary ""gore"" with a bunch of skinned bodies that are zoomed in on repeatedly. I didn't get the point of that and I really hate gross-out scenes that don't have a point behind them. Two, I didn't like that Lawrence Fishburne's character wasn't given more time to develop. He's the main reason I picked up this one.Basically, this movie is enjoyable if you are not intimately familiar with the Predator franchise, but don't expect to be blown away.",Predators
371,xenomorph_uk,"Almost, but not quite...",6,10 July 2010,"Ah, I wanted to love this movie so much, but there's just a few things that left this movie a little short of the mark. In saying this, there's plenty to entertain as well.The writers have quite clearly used the '87 version as a template, retaining most of the great parts as well as adding a few twists of their own. This format really should have given us a wonderful sci-fi movie, but they've let themselves down in several regards.The first is the obvious fact that they didn't bother recruiting a military adviser for the set. We were supposed to believe that these actors were a random selection of hardened killers from various hard-core backgrounds, but they came across as nothing more than uncomfortable amateurs.The actors spent most of the first hour stumbling around, huddled together in tight little groups like a bunch of scared school children. They kept firing their weapons from a hip position and not surprisingly depleted most of their ammunition within the first couple of acts. We're supposed to believe that a Russian spetsnaz with a 2,000 rounds per minute Gatling gun would struggle to hit a charging pseudo-boar, running in a straight line. They also seemed determined to uncaringly follow trails and had no idea how to move through the bush.Due to these layman errors, I found it difficult to really get into the movie for the first half hour or so. I was really quite irritated by the amateurish bumbling around.Anyway, my final gripe is with the cast itself. Very few of them were actually suited for the roles they played. Brody is nowhere near gritty or bad-ass enough to play the soulless leader. Laurence Fishburne, well... where exactly are all of the pies hidden on this alien planet? I found that I simply didn't care what happened to the cast at all and felt little attachment to any of them.Despite the annoying flaws, I was finally able to disengage my brain and settle down into an enjoyable movie experience. The action set pieces were great fun. I thoroughly enjoyed the hints at Predator culture, how they tick and I especially loved their technology. The end fight, while not quite as epic as Arnie's hand-to-hand in 1987, was still pretty awesome as well.Overall, for me this movie would've rated 8 or 9 stars were it not for the annoying issues I mentioned earlier. If you're a sci-fi fan, this is an absolute must see... just be sure to leave your brain in the car and try not to take it too seriously. :)",Predators
372,kg2006,Poor copy of the original,5,5 December 2010,"I give it 5 out of 10 although if it was not based on Predator I think it would earn a 6.The original Predator was a fun hokey sci fi action film with off the wall characters, dialogue and a closing credits sequence which was pretty unusual (the cast salute to the audience). It benefited greatly from production problems and some changes that allowed the story to play out as it did(with an alien design that is very memorable).Predator 2 was not in the same league of course-but Danny Glover was a compelling enough lead that I can watch it from time to time. But it started the downward spiral. The problem is that the predator worked great as an Arnie menace--but it seems that filmmakers don't know what to do with it in his absence. The main problem plaguing every movie since is that they make the predator weaker, and open to truces and friendship pacts with humans, they take the ""you aren't armed, no sport"" line which was just an easy way to explain why the woman wasn't being targeted and used it as a ""noble hunter"" device to spare women and children and justify lazy writing. The original Predator was a very strong, violent sob--when he loses a fight he laughs as the bomb counts down-he doesn't let Arnie go. He's a hunter-a jerk. Evil. Even against armed humans he has the advantage and he hides behind camouflage and shoots injured men and skins others alive. Not noble at all, but for some reason there is a fan base around the character, that has turned it from a menacing figure into a bumbling goon. The AvP movies were bad, partly for the reasons cited above, although Requiem at least had a predator close to the original height and the fight between it and the predalien mimicked the original movie enough that that sequence was almost competent.Now we have Predators once again trying to keep the predator franchise going without Arnie. I liked the basic concept and some of the ideas-(although the alleged original Rodriguez script of Dutch and other aliens who had killed a predator being dropped on a planet where they are hunted as a spectator sport for the predator homeworld could have been so much better if they had been given a budget to match). Unfortunately the execution on this version fizzled in my judgment. It copied aspects of the original movie a little too much, and as indicated at the beginning, they had to make the predators dumber, weaker, and prone to helping humans a little bit. The original Predator script wasn't exactly smart, but this one is dumber with less interesting characters. I liked Fishburne's fat faced nutty survivor and the humor of the convict but that wasn't enough. The Braga character was better than I expected, I didn't mind the doctor until near the end or the convict (until he was able to survive what Jesse Ventura could not and fight back). But I feared Adrian Brody would be annoying and he went far beyond what I expected. Not only was he super smart, never made a mistake, unlikable, but they had him take off his shirt and use Arnie like lines and SPOILERS successfully punch the predator a few times.Not even Arnold's best punch could hurt the original predator, and somehow Brody was able to whack these super-predators with ease. This was not suspenseful. It was horrible.I liked the concept of the predator dogs--but like so many recent Hollywood movies with fx and monsters, they do a poor job of establishing suspense and menace. The predator dogs appear, chase, get shot, retreat. Reminded me of the abysmal Clash of the Titans remake where giant scorpions that could easily crush a person were handled as if video game phantoms. As an audience we want to see why these predator dogs are scary or dangerous. We don't get to see it. They needed a few more parachute drops and allow us to see someone getting ripped apart.By the end of it I was rather irritated by Brody's character and the decisions of the filmmakers. I am not convinced a Predator movie can work without someone like Arnuld, maybe a Jason Statham would have been better for this--but they would have needed to be more inventive in defeating the predators on their own world. using alien technology, or the help of fellow alien prey.It could have helped maybe if it had taken a page from the Expendables in tone--while not a great movie, it did have some of the character camaraderie and casting that was inspired by the original Predator.The Predator alien is a cool design all dressed up with nowhere to go without Arnold Schwarzenegger to fight.",Predators

374,ricsim78,Better than the AVP movies at least,6,4 August 2010,"Note: I probably won't do any spoilers but it is there is just case.I was really excited to see this, after being horribly let down by the first AVP movie (not even bothering to check out the newer ones).I am a big fan of the original and I thought part II was pretty awesome as well.The good: I liked the cast and the way they knew nothing about how they arrived on the planet. You are basically thrown into the mix just like they are. The cast was good but definitely not as fun as the original. The scenery looked awesome, as does the female character, I think she is attractive. Adrien Brody did a great job and I felt his character was interesting. Topher Grace's character was good as well, he seems to be playing a lot of characters like this.The bad: (Warning: this may be counted as spoiler). The two different types of Predators thing was stupid (reminds me of a gimmick done in Jurassic Park 3, when there just HAD to be a bigger and badder dinosaur than T-Rex). Just keeping one set of Predators and actually keeping them in their roles would have been better. It seemed like less sport and more like they were just out to kill the people, which does not seem to me like how the Predator was intended to be.This could have been so much better, they got the scenery right and some plot twists were good, but in the end I was left unsatisfied and overall disappointed. I can name 100 ways to make this movie better, but I am sure there are those who will love it as well.Overall, it was kind of disappointing and I am hoping that maybe we will see the Predator character in a better movie some time in the future.",Predators
375,oceeprime,The Boys Are Back...and they're not fooling around!,9,16 July 2010,"I viewed this film yesterday and I was very impressed! This film definitely restores honor to the Predator franchise and makes me eager for more! The execution of the film was well done. There was a scene in the film where it felt like I was watching a Lord of The Rings film! The creatures were so menacing and tough-as-nails, that you wondered how in the world Royce and Co. were going to make it through. I loved the epic feel of the film. The acting was very good for a film like this, especially Laurence Fishburne's role. But, let's face it, the man is an acting genius anyways! I've read posts on here where people felt like there wasn't enough time to get to know the characters, but I disagree. We're not watching a work of Shakespeare. This movie was designed to do exactly what it was intended to do, which is to entertain. I left the theater feeling that I definitely got my money's worth. I can't wait to see it again, and I'm eagerly looking forward to the sequel! The only complaint I have here is the grisly demise of one of the humans. I felt that could have been left out. In all, Predators is a sure-fire hit with an awesome film score by John Debney. My hat's off to you Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Antal!",Predators
376,djeb2004,"A good flick, a worthy sequel",8,12 July 2010,"I saw this movie opening night in the theater and it was surprisingly packed. Movies like this around here I didn't think would have a large fan-base. I'll start with the basics. First off the acting. Adrian Brody surprised me with his role. He was completely believable. Every actor seemed to pull there own character together. The cast worked great. Topher Grace was probably the biggest surprise. He seemed the odd man out but he fit his role just fine. The story was pretty bland with the Surviving the Game as the basic plot. It was the subtle little stories that fell into the movie that became more interesting. The ideas of more than one specie to hunt on this game preserve were pretty cool. The creature effects were top notch. It was nice seeing the original Predator design again. The new predator designs were pretty cool and they each seemed to represent there own character. The new face on the leader Predator I personally liked as the design wasn't too scewed from the original but was different enough. The predator hounds were a cool idea as well. The CGI in this movie was used very minimally. I would say about 15 to 20 percent was CG which I prefer since films these days are heavily reliant on computer effects. The music and sound effects were pretty good. The score by John Debney was excellent. It put the feeling of the original back into this one. The sound effects were just fine as it wasn't trying to copy really much of the original which is OK. The movie felt like an older action movie and it does fit as a worthy sequel to the original Predator. I am sure why some people will not like this movie as it will be an acquired taste to like it, but if you come in with the expectation to see a Predator movie you'll like it. It won't really fill the void as an awesome action picture, or sci-fi or horror flick, it screams Predator movie mostly. I give this movie an 8/10. Its not perfect by any means and it does have some minor plot holes which any nitpicker will find and exploit. The movie does keep you interested the entire time and the attitude along with classic like scoring and good acting brings back fond memories of the original. Predators is a worthy sequel in the franchise.",Predators
377,jimforgod,*Honest Response*,10,29 November 2010,"Well i liked this new 1, however i cud see its obvious flaws i enjoyed the special effects and gore and the best part was the first bit with the drug cartel guys death/trap which creeped me out and built up tension to the doggie bit. I do feel that people give this film a way to harsh wrap which is disappointing so many people are die hard fans (yea i loved the first 1 to) i do agree that the acting was kinda of bad generally and for me Brody didn't sell his tough guy act to me, although i did feel bad for when the Russian guy got it i like him and sad to see him go, at least he went out with a bang >:)I said to my friend when we left the cinema ""my god the ending was just like the original"" but i still enjoyed it. What is interesting is that every1 always banged on about how all the other films with the predator in them were nothing like the original but now we got 1 thats similar to the original and every1s and now angry that is to similar to the first 1....... talk about make up your mind just enjoy it for what it is. A lot of people banged on about the trailer showing 20 predator targeting lasers, but really what did you expect the movie having 20+ sumthing predators in it hmmm??!? how would that of played out to its logical conclusion.. that would be your Hollywood overkill stop b*tch*n about it. It also opens up the myth of the predator race and helps expand our idea of what might be out there :OOOOOOOO!!!The reason i rated this at 10 is cause every1 else votes 1s :< which is way to harsh and unfair, if i was to be honest i would give this movie a 6 :)",Predators
378,AlTheReviewer,Predators,8,13 April 2014,"For me, this is the sequel the original film deserved. I was so disappointed by Predator 2 that i thought it would take a miracle for the franchise to be saved. That miracle came in the form of Nimrod Antal's Predators. Whereas in most recent Sci-Fi action films the acting can be ""wooden"", no such word can be used for the acting in this film. Adrien Brody gives one of the best performances of his career as Royce, a mercenary. Royce is a very complex and mysterious lead character that gives a breath of fresh air to a genre that is used to main characters with steroid filled bodies with not much acting talent. Their is a wide range of character personality thanks to the very good acting of such names as Topher Grace, Laurence Fishburne and Alice Braga. I was very impressed with the addition of the new-look ""super-predators"" alongside the familiar face of the original because it made a much more interesting background story, that shows the viewer that there is a hierarchy in the Predator species. Also, the addition of other extra-terrestrial species created a wider range of action scenes. The one criticism I have of the film was that parts of the plot were very similar to the original. This made the film a bit more predictable but it was still very enjoyable to watch.",Predators

And each flick we see has its own DNA interwoven with its own footprint.20 years of suspense, and anticipation, and die-hard fans of the Aleins, and Predators series, are suddenly faced with the next installment out of the blue.Sure, ""Predators deserves full credit for having a very commonly shared footprint, that miraculously keeps the common viewer glued to the chair, with his eyes fixed to the screen.10 minutes is all it takes - it is evident what the plot will be: a strange planet/jungle, with seven stranded people, fighting off strange aliens, and obviously, only one, or at most two, will make it out alive.And 1 second is all it takes for the common viewer to forgot his popcorn, drink, or any other comfort nibble which he may have taken with him in front of the big screen.Yet, the intense action, fighting, the initial mystery of where the protagonists were, the mystery of who/what they were up against - These were all the ingredients needed to make for an action-packed alien experience, which refused to dumb down its story. One by one, we saw them ( the protagonists) fall.Who's next? One question which would keep flashing across the screen of my mind, for every second I was there in front of the real screen.Incredibly, towards the end, we see the unusual twist, which having been incorporated at the end, made viewers like me, wonder: is this on-the-spot insanity?: The doctor, turning out to be a murderer, could see that unity was the best strategy.so what was he after? What could he possibly gain, by intercepting the other 2 survivors, especially at a time when they needed to escape? A movie truly worth its salt.",Predators

I don't want to spoil anything, Nimrod Antal is one of the best film-makers ever with his awesome team of directors, photographers and editors.

Instead go see it at cinema , pay your few bucks for the rise of a new franchise. Because, I can see things developing, slowly , detail by detail to a bigger conflict between humans and predators.

383,KidDrehmann,Predators Equals Badass,9,12 July 2010,"Predators is a complete display of bad ass on Robert Rodriguez and Nimrod Antel's part. Though not quite as good as its predecessors, the first two films not the AVP films, it still packs a shoulder cannon induced punch.Positives: The acting is awesome. This is not something you generally see in modern day sci-fi movies, however this movie is one of the exceptions. Though the characters of Royce, Edwin, Isabella, and Noland are the main examples of acting prowess, Walton Goggins is the real one that steals the spotlight. His character displays pretty good comic relief, a near complete disregard for some of his companions, and a inner genius that successfully fooled both the Predators and the audience. As for those people who believe that Adrien Brody and Topher Grace had been miscast due to their past roles, you are dead wrong. They couldn't be more perfect for their roles. Brody's character gave him and audiences a view of his inner bad ass, especially during his one on one with the Berzerker Predator. Grace progresses through the entire film as a doctor that seems out of place among a group of murderers up until the very end when the truth behind his character finally comes to light. A serial killer being placed in a group of mercenaries and members of the special forces from their respective country's is an excellent move from both the Predators and the people that came up with that twist in the plot. The action sequences really bring a fan of this series back to the same enjoyment and thrills they received from the first film. This movie truly goes back to the roots of this franchise and returns just as triumphant and successful as the original. And if that wasn't enough two Predators go claw to claw in a their own Mortal Kombat type brawl. Also I'm very pleased as well as surprised to see that Walton Goggins's character survived so long in the film.Negatives: Though they may be few in number every great movie has some negatives. For this one I can think of four things that I particularly disliked about the movie. First off, Danny Trejo has very little screen time in comparison to other big names in the movie. I felt that his appearance in the movie was like that of Laurence Fishburne and only being a cameo. Second would be the fight between Hanzo and the Falconer Predator. It seemed a little too short and very similar to a duel between two samurai, but I am only against the length. Third is the Predator-Berzerker Predator fight, which I also pretty much thought wasn't long enough. The final con would be the ending in which Royce and Isabella look up to see more parachutes coming from the sky above and have the entire ordeal that took place in the movie reveal to seem never-ending. This also seemed a little bit cheesy to me in a sense that if a sequel were to be made (which I am hoping for) it would be among a different group of prey teaming up with the two survivors to take on another trio of Predators.In the end I really recommend seeing this movie, especially if you are a fan of the franchise. It's action, suspense, and thrills will keep you enthralled and enjoyed with the film as it progresses through to the end.",Predators
384,riedud,The Predator franchise is a hard one to tackle.,6,11 July 2010,"With Robert Rodriguez's name attached to this movie I was completely game and looking forward to this new Predator movie. Reading production notes and the like, it seemed that there was hope for this one to be a great rehash. In the end Predators was a stretched out movie borrowing most of its ideas from the first and ONLY predator film.I'm a huge fan of the original Predator. What John Mctiernan did with Predator was nothing short of genius which is why I think all of the Predator movies since have fallen short in its wake. In that light here is my opinion of why Predators has ultimately tried and failed.With science fiction often times less is more. When one has to start asking too many questions the genre losses its appeal. Predators was introducing to many questions into the Predator lore that in my opinion was like re-writing the whole legend itself. Apparently the time and energy to find elite fighters on earth, kidnap them and do it all so that they do not know what is going on is worth the trouble of placing them on a foreign planet in order to hunt them. The mystery of how the predators work in the first movie is what really made it great. We did not know where they came from, how intelligent and so on. Predators offered us a little too much. Keep Predators mysterious! That's why we love them.Another aspect making Predator a great movie was the outstanding score by Alan Silvestri. A movies score is meant to compliment and help progress the story. In lieu of Alan Silvestri John Debney would be scoring Predators. He said he would incorporate parts of the original score for this film. Well not only did he incorporate but he flat out stole most of the score which to me is fine because I love the original but each movie has its own tone and story which should be accompanied by the right score. John Debney seemed confused about where to take the score with this movie, which I don't blame him because the story was a backyard version of the original movie. Borrowing too much from the original score is not going to make the movie work. Writing an original score perhaps inspired by Alan's could have helped.I think there also is something to be said about Robert Rodriguez not directing this and only standing by as producer. The use of the right lenses and close up shots was perfectly mixed in Predator however in Predators shots were impersonal and not thought out too well. I felt the director tried to cram too much in many of the shots. Help the actors with the lens, don't leave them bare, fighting for the scene.Lastly I will say that there were too many characters with too little development for each of them. You can only press a good actor to do so much with a faulty script. It also helps to let the audience figure out the story and not be told directly by the main characters what's going on, we are not idiots Hollywood! I can tell that Robert Rodriguez had the first predator fresh in his mind when he wrote this script because there were many similarities: jungles, falling off waterfalls, hand held mini gun, military folk, come on Robert, shame on you dude.The movie had some fun moments but in no way was it the kick-butt Predator movie I and so many others were hoping for. 6-6.5 out of 10.",Predators
385,Ultimex_Varptuner,Another Wasted Opportunity.,4,25 March 2011,"Spoilers ahead.I'm sure you may be wondering what Nimrod (appropriately named) Antal's Predators is actually like. Well, I'll save you a trip to the DVD shop because, of course, it's ultimately dung.As dungy as the vomit inducing (for all the wrong reasons) AVP franchise? Well, to be honest, it's worse.But wait a minute because this film isn't just a roller-coaster of crud from beginning to end, oh no. It's almost all the more disappointing for the fact that it actually starts really well. As promised the basics of the film, location and characters have been hammered together with love, and respect for the original franchise, albeit the array of 'big hitters' thrown together in the alien jungle mostly look about as hard as a hot banana. It grates particularly with Brody's lonesome mercenary tough guy, who despite the guy's acting skill looks all together too wistful and sad with his slender face, roman nose and doe eyes.None the less the initial expositions – the crates, the American SF soldier's traps (they should have made the film about him), the 'dog' attack and even to a point, the camp scene are all handled remarkably well. But beyond that, we enter Laurence Fishburn territory and it all goes south, quick. While initial glimpses of the predators camouflaged are no more than flashes, things remain pretty tense but soon we are annoyingly and patronisingly introduced to them one at a time – massive head predator, really massive head predator and sodding enormous head predator. Then we're on a rocket sled to film hell.While Fishburn's part isn't as bad as some are making out, it does herald the end of any kind of suspense and dignity in the film. After that Rodriguez and his mate might as well have called it 'I Hate Predator and Predator 2'. In truth, up until Fishburn's reveal and the awkward chase that follows, I quite liked the film and was wondering what all the people on the IMDb were griping about. But while we started off exploring, suddenly we are mired in a horrible creature feature, with idiotic, clumsy fist-fights featuring (seemingly) fat men in rubber suits who have neither the physical grace nor understanding of the role to represent what the Predator was set up as in John McTierman's original. Put simply, the predators occasionally look embarrassingly naff and even gift-like set-pieces such as the stand-off with the Yakuza guy pass without me inwardly going 'that was cool'.As two of the 'wolf' predators are slotted with laughable ease it rumbles towards an unthrilling end using the ridiculous premise that the 'hero' might be able to persuade 'classic' pred to help him fly their space ship back to earth (really). Then Rodriguez drops in the twist that no one can really be arsed with - Topher Grace's character is a nutter after all! Shock horror! He's a crazed serial killer who is quite happy to stay on the planet with the predators! No one bothers to ask what he thinks that might be like and how he thinks he'll survive. But this drek, in itself, is cinematic dynamite compared to the climax between Brody and Black Super-Mega-Ultra-Hollywood Predator of Doom 8000.Now, Arnie was a big guy. So was Dan Glover. Sadly, hard looking blokes aren't allowed to be film stars anymore. Apparently it's politically incorrect to portray western males as people who might be able to give you a decent sized battering. It might upset somebody, somewhere.Gender-Neutral fops on the other hand, are big business.Enter Adam Brody. Now, the film makers know Brody wouldn't be able to physically take on the BSMUHPOD 8000, so, instead of taking him on mano e mano, he uses his superior fitness (stay with me) to run the predator ragged. Then he stops... and strikes.Repeatedly.Now stop me if I'm wrong here but isn't the whole point supposed to be that the predators are not only very strong but also super-nimble and fast. That's the whole point isn't it? That they are the ultimate warrior, the ultimate hunter.If this guy can kick the shinola out of one, then I don't want to go to the cinema ever again.For god's sake, the film is about the predators, not their prey. So, BSMUHPOD 8000 ripping Brody's fanny-pack off and beating him to death with it, leaving Eric Forman alone on the planet with ridiculously improbable IDF sniper as his love-slave wouldn't be the chirpiest of endings, but to make a good film - IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE! I just don't get why Hollywood insists on shoehorning a 'happy' ending onto every film, despite what has gone before. Anyone out there only seen the American theatrical cut of Neil Marshall's The Descent? Right, go get yourself a copy of the original British cut and observe what I'm talking about.But I digress.As a big fan of the first two Predator films I must end by saying I despise the way Hollywood trashes its own legacy just to make a quick buck and while there are flashes of the right stuff in this film, it ends up the same way that almost all modern action flicks do: Limp wristed and filled with compromises.Do yourself a favour, watch this film up until Fat Ass springs his trap, then just switch it off and pretend that's the end.",Predators
386,Kakarot_XR,The hunters become the hunted. Or do they?,8,9 July 2010,"First off, I'd like to say there are a lot of folk that have been bad mouthing this movie because they claim it doesn't live up to the original Predator movie. Well, I say - let those fools be stuck in the past, it's time for the rest of us to move on and enjoy cinema.The movie is a massive improvement from the terribly written and directed AVP series. The series almost destroyed both the Aliens and Predator franchise. however, with the release of Predators the franchise has been saved.The storyline is gripping. It doesn't immediately go into action like so many other quick-buck films. It takes it time, using suspense and fear to keep the viewer on the edge of his or her seat. It allows the characters to develop (somewhat) and build relationships with each other.Once the action does get going, it proves to be violent. Extremely violent. Which is good, as that is the Predators' intention. To violently hunt and kill its prey. The action is 'nitty-gritty' with 100's of camera angle changes every other blow, it all stays in focus and allows the viewer to actually enjoy what they are watching.The CGI is decent and luckily the movie isn't filled with it adding a further sense of realism. The only fault with the movie would be the silly twist in the middle involving one of the characters. You'll know it when you watch it.All in all. 'Predators' is a damn good film. It isn't perfect, but certainly is entertaining and worth a first and second watch. Here's hoping the Blu Ray will include some nice extras =]",Predators

This is bottom of the toilet film making, which is bad on so many levels.Firstly it's a bore of a film, an absolute snooze fest, the pacing is poor throughout the jungle safari. It suffers from a horrendous script (and cringe-worthy dialogue); scenes which are so contrived they're laughable(which I'm sure isn't the intention of the script and directing). And finally it's just pointless(like why the hell was morpheus in it?!?).Arnold must be rolling in his grave after the travesty that is predators. I love my big, dumb action flicks, but predators is just stupid and dumb. I kept reaching for the remote to turn it off, but being a sucker for punishment persevered for no reward from this piece of sh!te film. Save your memories of what was great about the original predator with arnie and co(one of the best action flicks of the 80's) And if your curiosity gets the better of you and you have to see what this re-boot/re-make/cashola or whatever they call it of predators is like, make sure you have the original close at hand that you can play directly after/during/before to ensure you don't tarnish your memories of how great a flick the original is.Do yourself a favour and watch the original Predator - it's a way better experience and better use of your time, rather than the 100 or so minutes wasted watching this rubbish.Predators - Avoid 2/10.-(The arnie line is a joke I know he's not dead, I've used this line to emphasize how bad a film predators is)-(And no I don't prefer the Alien vs Predator flicks compared to predators, they are all turds in my book not worthy of my time.

As they get bad news about their situation, it doesn't have much impact on us because we knew how badly screwed they were by the trailer.I had figured out the mystery of Topher Grace's character before it was revealed.Adrian Brody's casting as one of the toughest guys struck me as strange at first. His haircut is so smooth. He seems very urbane given his line of work. My wife was gratified to see him without his shirt, though. His eyes were right. His words were right. He just did not look as though he had spent as much time out-of-doors as someone like him would have to. Real life super-tough warriors don't all look like body-builders— a lot of them do look like Brody. By the end of the movie, I'd made a little peace with the idea.It may sound that I am more critical of the film than I am. It starts out fast. The situation does not have to gather speed. War starts at the beginning and keeps going. A parachuting sequence is beautifully photographed as is the far-off geographical and astronomical scenes around the third act.As for their language, they do not merely speak as soldiers and killers do, they speak like especially foul-mouthed soldiers and killers from the beginning through the end.

Another final detail that could have made things more interesting is the inclusion of at least one type of fauna on a flourishing world. I mean come on, if there's plants, there's animals! Ending: Could have been the setup for a better adventure.Lets just say that if the main character got lucky we could have seen another Predator film set on the Predator home-world!Definitely worth a watch with good acting and action but don't expect miracles.

394,jnr83,Predators have lost their Killer Instinct,3,19 October 2010,"As having seen the original and number 2 I thought this would continue that great tradition, but alas, this was rubbish. Although there has been much criticism regarding AVP and AVP2, I thought the first AVP had some merit but if it had a stronger cast and storyline it would have been better.Firstly the cast seems to be dull, Adrian Brody is no Arnold Schwarzenegger. He actually looks and sounds like an idiot and is a try hard throughout the entire movie. If the lead role cannot be taken seriously the rest of the movie is dire straights. Further in the first Predator movie, time was spent getting to know the characters and that way the audience had empathy with the characters. Here we couldn't care what happened to them. Also Tropher Grace, the guy from Spiderman 3 is in this disaster and really doesn't add to the movie.The script writers need to be fired. There really is no plot here. A group of 'worthy' prey is abducted from earth and sent to this Alien planet to provide some hunting for the predators. What angers me is that these Super Predators, really can't beat the speed or efficiency of the first predator. These really don't seem that menacing and have lost their KILLER INSTINCT. I think even the weapons from AVP were better than the weapons they have here. Also why have the scene with Lawrence Fishborne? He seems to be bipolar or schizophrenic and wants to kill the group and take their weapons. Also we have this Yakuza member that fights this super predator with a samurai sword and manages to force a tie with both of them being killed? This is supposed to be a super predator who is faster, more powerful and smarter than the regular predator seen in the first predator movie. This is would be like comparing a commando to a soldier in the regular army. Also the predators have very little screen time. It seems that they rushed the script and the acting and action were casualties of that decision.This is a movie you should see only once and that is on free to air TV. This is a pathetic effort at making a movie. If this was all the fuss regarding Robert Rodriguez's script, then this script needs to be burned and another script writer with some talent should be employed. Really can't blame Nimrod too much as the script and cast is weak. Also they really need to give the predator that Killer Instinct it had in the first two movies. I will say that those who attempted the AVP movie had some good ideas but needed a stronger cast and story. I did like the weapons used in that movie. Also where has all the blood gone? The first two movies had tonnes of blood in them and it seems that as sequels have been made they have toned down the gore. We want gore. That is why we watch predator movies - good script, good cast and gore. A note to movie directors: Give us what we want, or else we will boycott the cinema.JNR",Predators
395,rickyricardomokwena,Much anticipated remake?sequel?,6,18 March 2014,"This was the much anticipated redeemer of the 'Predator' franchise which had been ruined by earlier versions of 'AVP'.This movie had it all going for itself an inconceivable cast with 'Adrien Brody' as 'Royce'in the lead,the jungle scenario and as the title depicts more of Predators themselves.The audience had been waiting to see a continuation of the cult horror classic 'Predator 1987'and what would happen when the predators come together.This movie was suppose to address questions that fans have been asking all these years.Like where do these predators come from?How do they reproduce?Do they have off-springs? Why are they violently cold blooded hunters? and so on.Unfortunately the movie failed to deliver answers to questions that many viewers would have like to see and which would have made the movie a much more success exceeding it's precursor.'Predators' is an apt work of art with many loop-holes that make it way below the standard of a masterpiece it should have become.One thing that confused viewers was the fact that it does not seem like a sequel at all but rather an attempted remake. This including the list of loop-holes it carries wear down the movie. Like the first scene where the actors are falling from the sky.The filmmakers should have explored more and revealed to the audience where the guys where falling from and why? Secondly, with all due respect, it is comprehensible that science says animals and people do evolve but the creatures have been altered far too off from the original look of the predator that was created by 'Stan Winston' it kills the 'Predator' effect and seemingly gives off a feeling that the filmmakers are maybe trying to go for an 'Alien'industrial grime vibe.With the predators looking thin in some scenes as compared to the irresistible and overpowering dominance of 'Kevin Peter Hall'.Later on the torch is passed back to 'Nimrod Antal', where it seemed as if the movie will explore a battle between the old classic predator and the new evolved ones,which could have worked nonetheless.But it doesn't because there is only one classic 'Predator'enslaved by other 'Predators'which yet is another loophole.The filmmakers leave too much to the mind and this is a mistake that thwarts expectations of the audience.Another loophole is the fight between 'Royce' and the 'Berserker Predator'which is very questionable as to how can Royce defeat that Predator which the original Predator failed to kill.Then this goes on to the end where 'Isabelle' played by 'Alice Braga' is left with Royce and they try to find a way out off the planet which by the way they just landed on through parachutes.With all things considered 'Predators' was a disappointment to fans of the original 'Predator' but even so it was a hit to sci-fi fans who love the sound of guns some jungle greenery.The action scenes were properly shot with a wide impressive selection of guns and a cast of characters to work with.The plot was not too bad if only the filmmakers were not in extreme anxiety to see another 'Predator' movie they would have taken time to look into the loop-holes and fill them in to create a masterpiece.Predators is mindless action with good special effects which is not boring to watch but rather very forgettable after seeing it.",Predators

Predators, though it's not a exception to the rule, it's more a tribute to the original movie.Though the storyline is somewhat different, it has the same elements as the original movie inside, just mixed differently, you'll be able to recognize them very easily. I had the sensation that they used the new technology available to film those scenes that just couldn't be done back in 1987.Sumarizing, if you enjoyed Predator, take a look at this remake and have fun finding the similarities.I would had given it 8/10 if they had added that line...",Predators
397,fmcchris,"""Predators"" suffers from lack of well-defined characters",6,14 November 2010,"I've always had a problem with the premise upon which the Predator films are based. The idea that an advanced civilization of aliens would spend a great deal of their time hunting less advanced beings for sport makes them seem more like humans than the superior beings they supposedly are. But if we are to believe that even advanced beings have a penchant for blood and gore, then so be it. But I think they are far more like us than they would care to admit.The problem with this film and others of its type lies in the failure of the writer(s)to fully realize the characters. Character drives plot, not the other way around. People are defined by their actions and a person's psychological makeup determines how that person will act in any given situation. In ""Predators,"" I did not feel any empathy with any of the characters. The only one who came close to showing any real, honest human emotion was the character Isabelle, played by Alice Braga. But this show of concern for her fellow human beings came very late in the movie. It would have served the interests of the film far better if we had learned more about her and the other major characters in the beginning of the movie during the exposition. In this way we, the audience, would come to care for these people. But this did not happen. Laurence Fishburne, who is a fine actor, was completely wasted in a gratuitous role and we never get to know him. Adrien Brody, as Royce, the ostensible ""leader"" of the group, is cold and one-dimensional, and his victory over the alien is made that much more unimpressive because of it. And, like Isabelle, he shows a glimmer of human feeling only at the end of the movie, when we already have stopped caring about him. When you feel nothing toward a character, you don't care much how he or she ends up.Filmmakers should try to understand that it is not special effects, great cinematography, sublime music, or even great acting that makes a film a success--it is adherence to the rules of good writing, which means creating three-dimensional characters who are thoroughly fleshed out, and by their actions, make us care about what happens to them. In the case of ""Predators,"" the only real emotion I felt was dismay that such creative potential was never realized.",Predators

The only surprise is who is left standing at the end of the movie. Definitely a made for TV movie like you normally find on the SciFy channel.

This is possibly the best of the Predator movies if not neck and neck with first one. Great plot with complex details. Great location with a fresh feel. Suspenseful and interesting through and through. Great cast with notable actors. This is a welcome change from the unknowns of the last several movies. Not predictable; however, you really need to have seen the very first Predator movie at a minimum to appreciate this one as this one is most-like a sequel to the first one. No sex in this movie. Violence is somewhat intense but this is not nearly as gory as some other R-rated movies like Ninja Assassin for example. Profanity is there with numerous F-bombs.

It's a great original sequel and Sci-Fi/Action take on 'The Most Dangerious Game.' I liked all the characters who really worked well together. Royce did surprise me, he was a good character. Anyone who cried because he isn't built like Schwarzenegger really should try meeting actual soldiers. He looked like a fit average soldier. Dutch, Harrigan and Royce are three completely different kinds of characters and to be honest thats partly what makes the franchise interesting. Oleg Taktarov and Danny Trejo where also cool characters and Fishbourned cameo was fun, although you can tell his role was meant to be a cameo for Arnold.The creatures worked when I was worried they would have been a bit cheesy, but the hunter aspect came into play.I think a lot of the scenes were good just because they reminded you of the original (Which I'm not sure is that good a reason.) There are a few nods for die hard fans, especially a creature that was the original Predator design.I can't decide whether or not I like this more than Predator 2, it doesn't surpass the original but it's head and shoulders above the two horrible AvP films (that's not hard).

I was angry when the Asian dude did what he did coz, frankly, if he could do that by himself he could have done a lot more! I just expected and wanted more! I wanted more chasing!

404,eneyeseekaywhy,Shitators,2,22 August 2010,"Predators begins with the cast of characters being literally dumped out of a spaceship, free-falling towards the surface of a planet. The last thing most remember is a flash of light before landing in thick jungle. How did they get here, and why? They soon realise they are not on Earth and are being hunted by new 'super-predators'.The reasoning behind the prefix 'super-' is the fact these predators are a couple of inches taller than their predecessors and have new shoulder weapons. They are also being hunted by wolf/boar like creatures courtesy of some bad CGI. From there, the whole thing unfolds with grim predictability.The cast of characters includes members of the Yakuza and Los Zetas, a warlord from Sierra Leone and a Russian hit-man. A group that would seem more at home in the latest installment of Mortal Kombat than a feature length film. Replacing Arnold Schwarzenegger's character is Adrien Brody, here portraying Royce, an ex-military mercenary. Brody seems to have received voice coaching from Tom Waits, resulting in a gravelly, 'tough guy' voice a la Christian Bale in The Dark Knight. A brief and unnecessary appearance is made about halfway through the film by Lawrence Fishburne as Noland, a scavenger with Multiple Personality Disorder. The script itself is a mix of recycled dialogue from the original two films and cringe-worthy one-liners. Brody's lines, in particular, seem more like narration than dialogue, as he constantly explains his way through the jungle planet.Unsurprisingly, the cast are killed off one-by-one. Most in incredibly similar scenarios to the original Predator. However, the death scene of the Yakuza member, after he finds a katana sword on this alien planet, is a nod to Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. Frustrating, to say the least, in a film of this calibre. We are then treated to a 'twist' ending. So bafflingly out of place is the revelation that it feels as if some of M. Night Shyamalan's rejected ideas got literally shuffled into the last few pages of the Predators script . In the final leave-it-open-for-a-sequel shot, our protagonist and his love interest, walk into the sunsets.The cast and crews initial response to criticism of the visual effects and film as a whole was to refer to the relatively low budget of forty million dollars. Just to put this in perspective Neil Blomkamp's District 9 was made for thirty million. Initial interest in this project was mainly due to Robert Rodriguez' (Sin City, From Dusk til Dawn) involvement. However he chose not to direct, instead recruiting relative unknown Nimrod Antal, director of the mediocre and forgettable thriller Vacancy. Rodriguez advises the fans to view this as a sequel to the originals and not as part of the 'Alien Vs. Predator' series. A wise move to try to distance this from the famously awful franchise, but thats where Predators fits, another badly made sequel. The rumours of a Total Recall remake begs the question which should have been asked of this film. Why?",Predators
405,koojaho13,Fortified with improved special effects and greater suspense,8,27 September 2010,"A simple story about people being hunted by alien species combined with awesome special effects and suspense works fantastic in the new Predators movie. Everything from the first Predator film is back: the game, the hunters, the jungle and the suspense. Nothing is new but everything is upgraded to a high quality standard which makes this the best film of this summer.The opening of this movie is epic and is easily one of the best openings in a movie. It helps the plot go right to the point with a momentum of energy.The story is nothing new except it's in bigger scale. Instead of the Predators hunting on earth, they abduct worthy opponents to their planet for game. Adrian Brody portrays Royce, the protagonist who meets other people he must survive with. You will see everything you saw in the first Predator film. There are many references and tie-ins it's almost like a remake.The acting in Predators is solid and it goes really well with the timing of music and action. There are well executed jump scare scenes throughout the film. Adrian Brody is great; he buffed up and is a totally new character. Don't let his past films get in the way. Also you might see a little less of Lawrence Fishburne than you'd expect which I found his character unnecessary except for the fact that he provides information about the Predators. That could have been done in another way.There was one scene of character development which was unnecessarily long. Some of this film could have been cut down.There have been statements that say this movie is predictable. This is only partly true. Predators is an action survival flick that has been fortified. Everything is better since the last installments. The acting and the special effects.The effects for the Predators are what you would like to see. Some great CG was used in this film and it improves in a visual manner. However some scenes had very bright colors and it was disturbing to the eye. They used the original Predator theme and some of the new soundtracks were effective in increasing the suspense.Predators is one hell of a film. It's suspense level is extreme; your heart will beat fast throughout the two hours and you don't get many breaks. It's got steady action and a great balance of sound. The sound is never too ear piercing or quiet and adds greatly to the setting. A great edition to the franchise.

406,TheGame111073,"So much promise, so little satisfaction",6,3 November 2010,"Predators is the latest movie in the ongoing series of films containing a character that originated in the movie Predator in 1987. This latest version boasts the same concept as the original. The film is very enjoyable on an extremely superficial level. It's big, bold, and jam-packed with action. It'll make every adrenaline junkie very happy. The film moves at a fast pace right from the outset as the action scenes come fast and in bunches. However, the main detractor to this movie being entitled, Predators, is that we never see more than one Predator on screen at a time -- except in the climax. Another flaw with the Predator movies is that, given the nature of characters, they garner so little screen time. This means the rest of the characters must carry the film and that's where this one comes up short.Predators is not a movie about compelling performances. This is a movie about action and killing. However, it does contain some commendable performances and one stand-out performance. The Predator character doesn't need too much skill to depict it, but to offset the limited screen appearances by it, the character opposite it should be someone that we want to stand and cheer for. This film lacks that character which is one of the factors that add to the demise of the it. Adrien Brody's character of Royce is supposed to be a bad ass. It's a throwback character to the classic 80's characters portrayed by once great action stars like Arnold Schwarzeneggar and Sylvester Stallone. It was written to be that kind of character but Brody is not the actor that can accomplish it. He does an above average job, but I find it hard to believe that Brody was the best choice to play him. Adrien Brody has never been much of an action star. He is a very good character actor given the roles that he's portrayed up to now. In the age of limited action stars, we have to settle for Brody's depiction of Royce. This character would have been better served if they'd cast someone like Vin Diesel, Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson, or Sam Worthington. Topher Grace offers a commendable performance as Edwin. He's was highly convincing as a two faced killer. Laurence Fishburne's performance makes the movie worth while even though his screen time is limited. His portrayal of the psychotic Nolan was by far the best in the film. His limited screen was a disservice to the audience. I loved every minute that his character was in the movie.Predators offers very little originality as it is basically the same movie as the first Predator. The plot has merely been updated with too many of the scenes from the original movie being transposed into this one. This movie pays homage to the original with not only the look of the film but with many things factored into the story. However, in many ways it pays it too much respect causing it to infringe upon the originality of this one. I, personally love when updated movies or sequels connect themselves to a prior incarnation. Conversely, Predators loses itself in the process of trying to connect the two films.I really love the original Predator. That was why I had high hopes for this one. My ongoing love of the first movie also adds to my ambiguity in rating this movie. On the one hand, I loved the fact that they tried to pay homage to the first movie, but in the same regard it doesn't add or extend the series in any way. My biggest issue with this film is that the creators of the film never divulge the origin of the Predators. The characters originated in 1987, 23 yrs and 5 movies later, we know no more now than we did when the first movie premiered. Somewhere in the process, they should have given us some details about the characters origins or their motives in becoming what we witness on screen. I liked the movie but I don't love it, still I would recommend it as a good action movie can cure any boring night at home.",Predators

I loved the first two but couldn't really see where they could take the story. The first AvP had some good ideas and was enjoyable but in the end it didn't really deliver.This just felt like a bad remake of the original. Nothing happened. There was a lot of running around in the jungle, while Brody spouted a top ten tips on how to hunt.I wouldn't have minded if it had been just dumb action, some cool set pieces and people going splat but there was hardly any of that either.Cmon Hollywood if you are going to resurrect a franchise make sure you do it justice or it just taints the memory of what has gone before ala Indiana Jones, Star Wars and Terminator.There are stories to be told for sure, so tell one.",Predators

410,falcolnpunch,If It Bleeds We Can Sell It,4,12 March 2014,"Predators, a belated sequel to Arnold Schwarzenegger's third best film (-- not an insult, the man made lots of incredible movies), stars Adrien Brody as a grizzled mercenary on an alien planet as he and a ragtag team of other brutes try to survive against the aforementioned Predators.This film could have been great. An impressive-enough cast with lots of possibly interesting characters against the odds: these odds being one of the better antagonists in Sci-fi film history. It's just a shame that while this film tries to riff on anything and everything that made the original '87 Predator brilliant comes off here as theft, as it borrows and homages too often. Without giving anything away here, this film changes a few key details from the original film but really does just use the exact same plot, taking it as its own and changing the characters from unwitting soldiers to unlikeable mercenaries. Whereas this idea is supposed to be a momento, a love letter to the first film, it instead plays out as lazy here (I was astonished to see that there's even a beat from the first Alien Vs Predator movie!), and while this isn't a remake or a ""re-imagining"" - or whatever words a Hollywood exec might use - it does, however, appear as one. Adrien Brody is an awful casting choice. This is a man who is a Wes Anderson regular - not someone who dispatches monsters for fun. And Brody spends the whole movie doing his best Christian Bale/Batman impression while elsewhere none of the other characters seem to grow or evolve as people, which is draining as they aren't particularly likable to start off with; each of them seeming to have some kind of assassin/criminal backstory to them. Danny Trejo, a perfect example, is gruff and no-nonsense Mexican-Drug-Cartel-Type here, playing it almost like he was in preparation for his Machete character (and by the time the credits finally roll you get the horrible realisation: Robert Rodriguez produced).There are positives here and there; the Predator itself is impressive for the most part and the film is welcoming in its violence, something that seems so rare in film these days. The scenery is lush and there are lots of cool angles from a technical point of view. Overall, Predators will do. But it's exactly that mentality that makes it so very disappointing. While the Xenomorph Alien has done its best to kill the Arnie memory and Predator as a whole for good, ""Predators"" adds very little to the franchise and treads far too close to the original. It really is sad to see the lack of creativity with such pulpy and already-proved source material.@JonnyJonJon1",Predators

It is missing the one-liners famous from the original or maybe they're there just not pulled off as well.The Predator dogs are a great new addition and the Predator camp is amazing. There were a few moments which made me jump, and some grim deaths.I was surprised by the number of negative comments that arose from announcement of the casting of Adrien Brody. He impressed me greatly in King Kong, true not the same role but still a role which he managed to surprise many people with and I knew he would be able to step that up again for this and he did. He was the highlight of the film for me, truly amazing! The rest of the cast were also great, each one different in character and style. Topher Grace always impresses me when he's not doing a Rom-Com and again is great here. Lawrence Fishburne's Nolan also makes an interesting cameo.In regards to the end and a possible sequel I personally am excited about the idea, how will Royce get off the planet and were will it take him?

""Predators"" has everything an action film fan could ask for: Gore, thrilling shoot-outs, plenty of explosions and loud noises and some great hand-to-hand combat sequences that are well choreographed. Adrian Brody does a fine job of playing the mysterious ""tough guy"" and all of the other characters (save for the bizarre casting of Topher Grace) did as was expected of them. The film has a very 80's feel to it with pacing, character development and even comedic timing, which was a nice, nostalgic tribute to the original film(s). I was also pleased with Antel's decision to not over-doing it with the Predators themselves, keeping them mysterious and menacing as they stalk their prey throughout the movie. The inclusion of new species was great, especially the tracking ""dogs,"" which held a very nice design. The scene with them was one of the best, save for the ending. And as for the ending; it's spot-on perfect. The final battle is filled with oozing blood and plenty of tense moments (although rather cliché) and feels perfect for a Predator film. The ""Berzerker"" dubbed Predator is a spectacle to look at, because we get that shock and disgust that we had when we first saw the alien in the original film. This thing is wickedly designed and even though we only get a few shots of it's actual, awful, face, it will stick with you.

Jungle was WAY scarier when the governor was in it, and Danny Glover's predator was way smarter. We see a couple of new predator-tech devices, but overall i'd say there's only one new thing we get to know about them - it is their hunting planet. To be honest, when i first heard about the action taking place on a ""predator"" planet, I've expected something different. I know, that creating an ""Avatar""-like jungle is very expensive, but they should have at least put in a couple of alien plants or something so that the vibe would be right.. Another big problem is Adrien Brody as the lead. I understand, that he was especially selected to go as far away from ""standard"" as possible, but i don't think he pulled that role off.

415,nicolasmarinus,Finally a worthy sequel to a great original,9,18 December 2010,"It's clear they had a real long look at the original film and decided to keep the best pieces (the tension, the focus on group interaction, the music) but also try new things with it to attain the same feel of mystery the original was so good at.The visuals are gorgeous, the acting solid, the writing exciting. And what I really love is the fact that there is very little use of CGI. What little there is, is convincing or subtle. Laurence Fishburn's appearance was a complete surprise to me and I loved his character.

This one is quite the same with the first one where some tough guys trap in the forest and kill by predator one by one. This one is for the new audiences, i guess. The first 40 minute you didn't see the predator, just like the old one where the director tried to create tension by not revealing the predator to the audience. But,it failed because most of us already known the predator inside out for so many years. And the characters talk about how scary the predator was, come on, we knew this all already.anyway, just for entertainment, and watched some machine gun shooting, doesn't hurt to watch this predator 3.",Predators

Batman dubs over the main character very well, I am impressed with that. There was no character development in this movie and you could see the same plot - only better - in the original Predator. This also has some of the woooorst dialogue in history e.g; ""What the f*ck are you"" - ""i'm aliiiive"".As many have mentioned already, these ""super""(ha) predators are extremely UNsuper in that they can be killed as easily as a paralysed rabbit and they appear to be as intelligent as an ape. I've given this movie 2 stars because 1:the original classic predator made an appearance and 2: it had an ending (thank god). I was going to give this 3 stars but they killed off the classic predator in a very lousy way.Seriously folks, if you haven't seen this one, please don't bother because you will be quite disappointed.

418,littlejimmy835,"A step in the right direction, but still a letdown.",6,8 July 2010,"Predators is the long awaited sequel to the 1987 science fiction classic Predator and it's 1990 sequel Predator 2. Ignoring the events of the recent atrocious Alien vs Predator films, Predators follows a mercenary named Royce as he is and seven other killers are abducted by the alien monsters known as the Predators. They are released on a jungle planet, which they discover acts as a giant game reserve for the Predators to hunt alien beings from around the universe, and that they are the latest game for a new breed of Predators.So here's an act by act breakdown of Predators.The first act of the film is flawed, but solid. The films starts off a little too fast paced for my liking, as our lead characters are introduced rather abruptly and are not given enough back-story or character development for the audience to form a bond and be able to relate to them; for some of them, we don't even have a chance to learn their names. And even though all the characters all being shady untrustworthy strangers in a strange place, they somehow make the decision to form a team almost instantaneously. However despite these flaws, the film manages to capture interest; there is a sense of mystery and suspense as we are left to wonder who are these people, why are they here, and where exactly here is? The jungle setting manages to be both beautiful and claustrophobic, and suspense is added as the Predators have yet to be revealed.The second act of the film is where things start to pick up. The pace of the film slows down, allowing the audience a bit of a chance to get to know the characters; some of them even get the chance share a few lines of dialog about their back-stories and personalities, though unfortunately most still don't. Answers to the previously established mysteries, while entirely predictable, still do carry some impact. The action starts and actually manages to be rather intense; the ""Predator hound"" attack scene is probably the highlight of the film. The special effects look rather good for such a low budget film, though it is curious that the Predators cloaking effects do not look as good as they did in the first two films, despite those films effects being done with old fashioned optical effects as opposed to this films CGI.Unfortunately, everything seems to fall apart in the final act. Agin the pace of the film seems to be rushed; suspense is all but thrown out the window and character development comes to a halt, instead just devoting the remainder of the film to sub-par action scenes. It's as if much of the film has been cut to shorten the runtime; something I suspect has happened, as many scenes that appear in the trailers do not appear in the final cut of the film. Characters are killed off quickly and without tact, without giving the audience much chance to actually care for their demise. Fight scenes with the Predators seem more in place within a Super Sentai than a Predator film, as we are presented with men in rubber suits awkwardly and ungracefully getting into fisticuffs with our human protagonists, who somehow manage to hold their own against these 7 foot tall monsters; something that Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime couldn't do in the original film mind you. Overall the third act seems to have more in common with the dodgy fan film ""Alien vs Predator: Seed"" then the original two Predator films. In fact, just imagine ""Seed"" but with a higher budget, and that's pretty much what you've got here.Final Verdict: The film is a step in the right direction for the Predator franchise, as it has effectively distanced itself from the Alien vs Predator films, and manages to be more respectful towards the original mythos than the AVP movies ever were. However just because this is ""better"" than the last few films, doesn't mean it's good. This movie isn't anywhere near as good as the original Predator, and it's not even as good as the ""run of the mill"" Predator 2. It plays out more like the most expensive Predator fan film ever made than a legitimate entry in the franchise. While there are a couple of scenes that will make Predator fan-boys feel nostalgic, with the occasional homage towards the original films and whatnot, ultimately this film pales in comparison to the originals, and just isn't a very good film in it's own right.Here's hoping there is a really good directors cut of Predators coming out in the future. Otherwise I recommend that unless your really desperate to see this, you just drive past the cinema to the video store and rent the original Predator and Predator 2 and watch them again.",Predators
419,horrorshowmovie,Takes itself too seriously,5,16 June 2011,"""Predators"" has a cool idea behind it. The premise is that a group of killers and soldiers are dropped on an artificial game preserve and hunted for sport by a group of aliens.This could be great stuff in the right hands. I have a vision of this movie directed by Robert Rodriguez. His version would have Danny Trejo as Machete (yes I realize he's already in the movie), Michael Jai White as Black Dynamite, and Bruce Willis as John McClane. That version would be a lot funnier. The predators wouldn't stand a chance. ""Predators"" goes part of the way. The human characters are ridiculous caricatures. The Chechen soldier uses a suicide bomb BECAUSE CHECHENS ARE TERRORISTS. The Japanese guy finds a samurai sword lying around, and he's an expert at using it, BECAUSE Japanese PEOPLE ARE GOOD WITH SWORDS. The white, hillbilly criminal keeps getting into conflicts with the black characters. There's also the Mexican drug-enforcer type guy, but he doesn't do much. I kept expecting him to whip out some drugs.This is all great if you're going to make jokes, but aside from some comic relief from Topher Grace, ""Predators"" takes itself way too seriously. It could have been a fun B movie with some self-aware humor thrown in.",Predators

(sorry rapid fast camera movement don't cut it for me anymore as scary)guys I loved predator the original. coming out of this movie i felt disgusted and old. someone took a movie i loved and killed it. please don't see it and don't rate this awful movie the wrongly rate it has right now on IMDb.",Predators

Not just I haven't found those extra things I expected but It wasn't even a 'well-done' A category action flick.The script is not just uncreative, full of clichés but these clichés are not well glued together. Many times I was wondering, ""is it irony or serious?"" I couldn't submit myself to the thrilling feeling these kinds of films should deliver because of the silly jokes and poorly written dialogues. And it was too serious to be laughed at (unlike 'the Expendables' to say a good counter-example)I seriously do not expect character evolution from such a movie, but then lets not pretend there is one. Each and every turn of character and plot was boring and without novelty.There a bit more than normal logical problems about the Predators. First they had a flock of dogs, used their guns and cloaking armor. But they somehow forgot all about this later on. And I could just go on like many of you did here, why is the environment so like earth, why no weapons, why so ways to kill those bastards later .....To sum up, it is not well done.

425,lastostadas,"Shame on you, Robert Rodriguez",4,16 July 2010,"Difficult as it is to make a decent prequel to classic summer blockbusters as were ""Predator"" and ""Predator 2"" movies, it's just unthinkable how low this prequel has fallen. If you think AVP2 was the worst installment in the Predator series, think again.Predators, directed by unknown director Nimrod Antal, is a film with little ambition, even less pretension, that rips off scenes and dialogs from other movies of the genre, without being able to produce any memorable quotes of its own. If you've seen the trailer, I'll let you know that the dialogs and plot won't go deeper than that. How come no script writer is able to write a decent script? or is it that Robert Rodriguez think we're all dumb and stupid, and just enjoy watching blood and gore and silly drama? Sure, RR thinks enjoyment and intelligence are incompatible, but what is true for him doesn't mean it has to be the same for the rest of us.Having come to this point, little can be said for the actors, quite lost in all this non-sense, and director, who just fitted the job as well as he could. Adrien Brody as the lead actor was, in my humble opinion, a nice surprise, still, he won't be remembered for his performance on this film. No plot nor twist, bad dialogs, bad characterization, average acting and directing, this movie has still got some entertainment value if you don't mind for the rest. There are some good action sequences and thrilling scenes, but don't except them to be breathtaking or out of the ordinary.Little remark: In the trailer you get to see Adrien Brody been targeted by multiple Predators with red spots pointing at his chest. Don't fall for this one because it doesn't happen in the movie. How lame. Shame on you Robert Rodriguez.",Predators
426,JoshuaParis,Predators Almost Hits The Mark,7,13 July 2010,"Predators ReviewIn A Nutshell... Eight of Earth's most dangerous Soldiers and Criminals awaken falling into an unknown jungle – on an alien world. As they try to work together to stay alive, an invisible enemy hunts them for sport. ReviewIn 1987 John McTiernan directed a testosterone filled action flick, which pitted Arnold Schwarzenegger against a bad-ass alien, it did well with its worldwide audience and is still considered a solid action film today. But after a poor sequel, which replaced The Terminator himself with Danny Glover (bad idea) and two laughable spin-offs, it seemed the predator franchise was all but dead and buried. Twenty-three Years later producer Robert Rodriguez (Sin City) and director Nimród Antal (Vacancy – but don't be put off just yet) have come together with an unproduced 1994 script by Rodriguez – who has been eager to get the picture made for quite some time. The film does well with the original formula, a jungle, a group of mercenaries with big guns, a strong leader — who in this case is Oscar winner Adrian Brody (The pianist, King Kong) who has bulked up for the role of Royce, but is merely a shadow of Schwarzenegger's Dutch in size. But what Brody lacks in statue, he makes up for in pure acting talent, and brings a well needed central performance, to a film that ultimately lacks in dialogue.The supporting cast unlike other movies of this genre, don't just play the part of a large body count, but have a likable mentality (well some do) similar to James Cameron's Aliens – but don't get me wrong, none of them are by any means Bill Paxton's Hudson. An honourable mention goes to the Katana wielding yakuza Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien) whose sword skills are somewhat deadly. Unfortunately one of the biggest disappointments of the film is how the predator is handled, with the introduction of the new berserker Predator, which hunts the humans and Predators alike. You would think they would be ten times the hunter that the first was – But actually they are a lot sloppier in comparison to the 1987 original.Final ThoughtsThe first half is a brilliantly paced action movie which lives up to expectations, in many ways surpasses them. Unfortunately due to a few minor hick-ups and a dull climax it suffers in the third and final act. But overall a well earned three star effort, which should grant Nimród Antal another bash at the recovering franchise. 3/5 Stars www.CrazyAboutFilm.com",Predators

428,archwordsmith,good but not satisfying enough,7,8 August 2010,"PREDATORS!! When I think of this word my neurons automatically spark back to the jungles where Arnold and his men are fighting out against a force they can't see, a force they can't overpower with all their gunpowder and artillery, a force that one by one kills them and skins them later, finally hanging them upside down from the trees. The movie was released way back in '87 when I was two. Well I got to see it for the first time in the summer of 2003; a whole 16 years later when sci-fi movie were a treat to watch thanks to the matrix and its many clones. This movie had very basic SFX but somehow they looked astonishing. When I think about it and question myself why does the movie still appeals to my senses and for the matter of fact to the senses of millions of movie aficionados' is because that the movie scored in one aspect; FEAR – it created a sense of fear that would make us curse the soldiers every time they made a silly move, a fear that made us wish that Arnold ends up gifting a really horrific death to ""the jungle that came alive"". It really was a movie, or rather is a movie that will be cherished by generations to come, no matter how visually unbelievable the SFX get in the future movies.So when I heard about this new flick I was really excited keeping in mind the massacre of the franchise in the name of AVP. Also the heavy duty star cast got me all pumped up and I eagerly waited for the invisible, horrific aliens to blast my senses off using their triangle focus lasers. And so I went to see the movie the very same day it hit the screens in my town.About 2 hours later I was out having enjoyed a lot. The cinematography was great (especially the scene where they all stare at the horizon in disbelief), the acting was good keeping in mind that it is an all out action flick (especially the guy who you people remember better as the venom/Eddie Brock Jr. from the Spiderman 3), the stunts and action was cool, the SFX brilliant and the biggest USP of all was a beefed up Adrian Brody (remember pianist, king Kong). But at the end of it all I was disappointed because the main star of the movie was not threatening enough. Yes the predators don't enchant you, they do not instill any fear in you, and they do not make you wish for their death. And that is where the movie ends as a disappointment for the predator maniacs like me.My verdict is; go and watch the flick because it really is good but do not expect the same intensity as in the original. Also Mr.Brody is a great actor and has built up a lot of muscles but he still ain't Arnold when it comes to action flicks.A word of note to the filmmakers: - please do not waste actors like Danny Trejo and Lawrence 'Morpheus' Fishburne in such miniscule roles.",Predators

The only thing I was a bit disappointed with was the lead actor and you just don't get the same rapport with the actors as you did in the original. Adrien Brody just doesn't quite cut it for me and he has this slightly puzzled look on his face for most of the film.

It was only after i see one of the creatures to realize , that i've seen this thing before.The movie starts by throwing a bunch of people who don't know anything about one another into the jungle. By that point, we understand they were not doing a simple hitchhike in the jungle, no sir they were not. I haven't seen the first Predator movie so i have no idea of the story. The feeling i've got from this modern version is the same: i don't know the story. Unless i've failed to realize the plot, i reckon it isn't nothing new nor old - it's just a way to the means.Acting wise , i wasn't moved at all . I don't know if it has to do with the lack of remarkable Hollywood stars or just the strange-loony character portrayed by Fishburne, i still don't feel they were compelling.The heart of the film though , is the gore , the violence and action. If it had promised , then it delivered. Though the way the characters are discarded throughout the movie is not new , it is still acceptable. The Predators itself looked pretty good, it's good to see they've actually payed attention maintaining the species characteristics and looks.Overall , the movie offered a good and solid 90 minutes of action - though the lack or poor quality of the story dropped the ball a little, it's still watchable.6.4",Predators
431,fahycolm,Few times in movie history have the audience wanted shoreline sex with the swamp thing . . .,2,10 April 2013,"The biggest predators in this movie are clearly the producers, but one of the good things about reviewing a movie about ridiculously ruthless, well armed, decently ugly beasts on foreign planets hunting down a bunch of all-too-lovable murderers, revolutionaries and psychopaths is that you get to hang up your brain for 90 minutes. Everybody who likes a bit of sci-fi loved the original Predator, especially that iconic scene where, in pursuit of Arnold Schwarzenegger, it comes strutting out of a moonlit lake, dripping wet and bristling with blue static. Few times in movie history have the audience wanted shoreline sex with the swamp thing, but this was probably one of them. Ever since then the audience have been clamouring for another Alien Ursula Undress moment. Well you'll have to wait a bit longer. In the meantime the producers of this outing, the third in the Predator series, have mauled Adrian Cody's career (ok he did it for the money). Here he heads up a bunch of bady earthlings, ostensibly selected for their capacity to be ruthless, who are dropped on an alien planet where the Predators come to play hunt'n kill. Cody spends much of the movie with a voice in dropped D, as those trying to Arnie-fy himself against his weedy nerdy body. It doesn't work. Not even the airbrushing of his pecs will convince the audience that this scrawny face tops anything other than a scrawny body. So the movie is off to a woeful start, its premise that the earthlings are all nasty boys woefully undermine by an incredible leader. The producers, one suspects, thought a little about this, and so had the ""script writers"" (possibly recruited from the set canteen) identify to the audience the nasty background of the gang which include a drug smuggling Mexican from Tijuana, a Guatemalean female rebel, a prison convict who ( in a rather tasteless sequence) apparently only ""rapes bitches"" at 5pm, and a member of the(laugh out loud) Sierra Leonean RUF. We are now just five minutes into the movie and you can almost hear the audience screaming for blood. The sooner this cast is filleted the better. 1/5 (I give it one mainly for Laurence Fisbourne's very watchable Heart of Darkness cameo and the set pieces and the cinematography, which are occasionally decent enough).",Predators

433,bad_badger,A good effort at recapturing the original,7,9 July 2010,"++Contains Spoilers, probably++ Just back from the cinema and I found this a very acceptable sequel. Keeping the original score (or at least a very similar version) and setting virtually everything in jungle and forest went a long way towards making fans of the Schwarzenegger original comfortable within the first 5-10 minutes.There wasn't too much messing around with the Predator mythos other than the injection of some sort of caste or clan system (much of which went over my head), but I admit to being a bit disappointed at the range of lethal gadgets the Predators employ (not much more than the wrist blades and 'parrot guns'). I was always a fan of the hardware sported by the hunter in Predator II and felt its absence in this film.All of the principal cast did a good job, in particular Walton Goggins injecting some much-needed comic relief in an otherwise rather starchy we're-all-badasses script. A bit of a pity they didn't use Danny Trejo more than they did. The movie could have done with some louder charismatic presence, though - none of the cast quite measured up to the Schwarzeneggers, Venturas and Weathers from the original (and who can blame them?).The momentum of the movie sags a bit in the middle when the characters briefly hole up with survivor Laurence Fishburn (although Fishburn puts in a good turn as a crazy veteran), but otherwise sets a reasonably engaging pace throughout.No real surprises in the plot and what few twists there are are easily spotted, but that doesn't harm the film in any way - action genre movies are allowed to be predictable and often benefit from it.There are also quite a few situational or musical cues that are almost identical to the original movie that makes me wonder whether Predators would have been better to try and stand on its own two feet rather than invoke constant nostalgia in the viewer (or perhaps that's just me).At any rate, it is an enjoyable movie. The CG is effective, the deaths suitably brutal, the Predator suits aren't too bulky or rubbery and the conjuring-mime antics of the aliens are kept to a reasonable level (have never enjoyed the excessive contorting and gesturing of guy-in-a-suit creatures - if the suit looks cool, let it do the work.

434,leeandfong,Wow - Way better than I imagined a sequel could be!,8,8 July 2010,"To begin with, I'm a fan of the first two and felt insulted by AVP. So I went into this with some trepidation; in fact, I almost wasn't even going to bother with a cinema viewing on this based on how rubbish AVP had been. But goooooooo, ruuuuuuuun, get to the sineeeeemaaaaa.The movie opens with a bunch of people parachuting into the jungle. They're armed, look mean and have no idea why they're there. Slowly the film starts to make revelations as to who they are, what they're doing, what this place might be... and I mean slowly. One of the great joys was the film didn't feel under pressure to blow things up and have explosions in the first five minutes, it carefully took its time to show us around and start building the mystery. Just because it went slowly didn't mean it was boring; in fact, the pacing was great, the story was tight and suspenseful so that when things start to go wrong, beginning with an attack by aliens hounds, you actually know who these people are. By the time the predators make an appearance halfway into the movie, it's already a great survival and hunting story that now ratchets the tension higher. Throw in a couple of surprise twists, a few cool moments (Lawrence Fishburn's entrance is sublime) and some terrific action and you've got the genuine summer blockbuster to please any predator fan.I saw the first movie when I was 14 and it freaked me out. I'm 37 now and there were times when I felt like I was back in the day, loving every creature roar and macho one-liner.The big surprise for me was Adrian Brody. The weedy thin actor turned out to be an inspired choice for the lead. Rather than the muscles and brute force of Arnie, we've got a hero who is lithe, athletic and relies on intelligence rather than brute force. The guy also commands screen presence and brings acting gravitas and depth to something that could have been paper thin. Kudos to you, Mr. Brody.My one serious criticism is that the movie pays homage to the original a few too many times and too directly. It's nice to hear ""over here, turn around"" in a hat tip to Bill Duke from the first film; but when the Yakuza-assassin character pulls his samurai sword in an almost shot-for-shot and musically note-for-note duplicate of a scene from the original it over-eggs the pudding. Don't worry though, once our Yakuza goes toe to toe with a predator in bladed combat you'll be back to loving every second.",Predators

Just in time, a parachute pops open decelerating the speed but not quite enough for the typical soft landing. He, just like the rest of the characters and as well the audience are confused what is going on. All characters arrive to this undisclosed location unaware of what happened prior? Who was involved? Or why they were chosen? The characters are pretty straight forward with almost every possible ""cardboard cut out"" you can think of such as Cuchillo, Danny Trejo, who is part of a Mexican cartel. Then, we have Hanzo, Louis Ozawa Changchien, who is part of a Yakuza, an organized crime syndicate out of Japan. Then, there is Mombasa, Mahershalalhashbaz Ali, who is part of a tribe and he is that guy with those spiritual beliefs. The list goes on with a straight forward US military operative, a Russian, a Doctor, a Death Row Inmate and of course the nut case, Noland, Laurence Fishburne, who is completely useless in this movie.The movie starts off promising but it eventually gets plagued by horrible acting, bad dialogue, flawed character design and no suspense. The first encounter was with the Predator dogs? I just made that name up. The action sequence was the typical guns a blazing as the characters defended for their lives. The Predator-dogs have multiple elongated horns piercing from their body including the side of their mouths similar to a mastodon. Now comes the breakdown, for hunting game, the alien race eats their prey, correct? Well, the horns on the side of the Predator-dog mouths were so long that it would be impossible to eat. These ravaging aliens need to eat, so how do they? What this comes down to is poor character design. You base a movie on the alien race to hunt and eat but yet these Predator-dogs wouldn't be able to do that. Thus, I am going to sit back and think ""Hey this doesn't add up."" Grant it that it may not come off something major, but when the basic concept of the film is centered on hunting game, then yes, this is necessary to critique. The Predator-dogs, I understood what they were used for as it's clearly explained in the movie but after that this encounter the viewers never see them again. Why? *Shrugs shoulders*Royce: Who are you? Noland: I'm the one you don't f*** with.Noland: They can hear you. Smell you. They see you.In text, these lines may not come off as particularly bad, but the delivery sure was. These are just a few instances where the dialog itself wasn't bad but the presentation of it is just completely laughable. Here, during the middle of the movie, this is where it starts to become cringe worthy or laughable here on out. I understand this is suppose to be a B-movie, but it got to the point where it wasn't enjoyable. I wasn't in to it as I was earlier on. The suspense was none existent and I stopped caring. In fact, the most interesting characters got axed off in the film. I don't know what it is about these movies, but the intriguing characters that I enjoy watching never live. Why? *Shrugs shoulders*This WAS a film I was really excited about. It became one of those rare instances where I was stoked to see some blood shed, excessive violence and legitimate suspense. Unfortunately and oddly enough this didn't happen. My initial thought when I saw the trailer was when I saw the title ""Predators"" I kept thinking, there is going to be an orgy of these creatures who relentlessly try to kill these people. Instead, I get one predator at a time. I don't get 2, 3, or 50 million at once, I get one at a time. Honestly, the filmmaker just repeated what was done before with no excitement. Another thing that needs mentioning, the planet is a game preserve for the predators. Who controls it? There was no sort of indication that the predators were in charge that is unless I am suppose to bank off that one parachute device in the beginning of the film. Is it the humans who chose these people and flew them to the alien planet? Is it the predators? No closure every came about and I don't have enough information to make an educated guess. As for any kind of assumption, that's out of the question.I won't say the film is terrible but that it was just disappointing. I really wanted more and I didn't get it.This film gets a 2.5 out of 5. The potential was there, it really was, but it failed to capitalize with the over all picture.",Predators
436,vikasthegunner,The Sum of its parts,7,27 September 2010,"The first thing that came to my mind when I watched this movie is that the Predators are not scary anymore. Back in 87 when the first movie came out everyone agreed that these creatures from outer space were creepy. The $98million profit figure is proof of the movie- goer's fascination with creepy extra-terrestrials with futuristic weaponry, infra-red sight and lethal combat abilities. Of course, there was also guv'nor Schwarznegger. Fast forward twenty three years to 2010 and we have a group of soldiers, mercenaries, gangsters and psychopaths on a strange planet pitted against the same creatures. Director Nimrod Antal uses the same formula that has been used in Hollywood for the past few decades, a bunch of clueless people versus bloodthirsty foes. One would almost expect Adrien Brody and Alice Braga to be doing it in the bushes while the predators hack an unwitting friend in the next scene but fortunately the movie treads a different path. The Predators look and behave in the same manner with minor improvements. The CGI work is certainly done well,the characters have believable backgrounds, there is sufficient action to please the action movie buff but somehow the movie fails to impress. There isn't any mind- blowing special effect to talk about or visceral fights to eagerly discuss. To sum it up, Predators is a faithful addition to a franchise that was created in the eighties. The characters are believable though they fail to make you care about them, the action is solid but feels strangely lackluster. On a positive note Adrien Brody proves that he can grunt if he wants to. Maybe someone should make a gangster movie with Adrien Brody in the lead role.",Predators

Sure Vin Diesel wasn't much with the acting, but at least he looked the role. But Adrien Brody, WTF? And he had all the movie lines handed to him and he did the whole acting bravado with the attempted acting gruff voice. But it was Acting and not believable. This guy would get his butt kicked in real life. If you're going to have someone fill Arnie's shoes at least make him big enough to carry them. And not just talking physical size, I mean physical screen presence. James Cagney at 5'5"" was a believable tough guy. Bogart at around the same height, same thing, believable! But this guy was just trying waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too hard. The best parts about the movie were Laurence Fishbourne's short-lived stint. It smelled of Apocalypse Now, but it was very entertaining. When he stepped in the movie, the rest of the cast looked insignificant. Especially, the lead. The ex-con character added a little spice to it, but my favorite character, and this is just wrong for a guy to say, was the lead female, or make that the only female, for that matter. I believed her a lot more than the lead guy. Stay with me, I like Adrien Brody when he's doing what he can and should be doing. But being the macho leader in Predators. We don't have a better action star available? It makes me laugh. Everyone laughs at those old action heroes but they fit the bill. This guy didn't.",Predators

Then, they found a survival that had gone insane and shooting their way through predators. That's about it, that's the overall plot line. It is stupid, not interesting, and almost makes me fall asleep. Score: 3.5/10==Music== The background music was mediocre at best, and out of sync at one part. Score: 5/10==Graphics== The CGI are really outdated for 2010's standard, especially at one scene where they show an explosion. It was trying to look gore (like God of War gore, which I think it should be) but quite unsuccessful in my humble opinion. Score: 6/10==Characters== Of all the characters, Stans (Walton Goggins's character) was the best. He tried to be funny, and it was pretty good. The Mexican and RUF guy died before we really get to know them. Isabelle, the IDF chicks was hot and pretty good. The ""doctor"" was not convincing and he does not give me any emotional impact like being angry or felt betrayed. Nikolai and the Yakuza was badly written character. Noland is only being written to extend the length of this movie.My biggest complaint is the one with Adrien Brody's character, Royce. Being the main character, he definitely deserved the ""Least Known Main Character Award"". He acts like an asshole in the movie, being not give a damn to the most of every one, he had literally no on screen chemistry whatsoever with Isabelle during the movie. He run alone to the spaceship just to found out he had no idea how to get on board. (And suddenly, he realized that he's not really such a bad guy after all) So he went back, act like he care about the others. He killed the predator and save Isabelle then become a great hero. In a nutshell, I just don think his characters make sense, at all. Score: 5/10",Predators

A lot of people may have slammed this for having a bit of an open ending (that is to say there could be more in the series). To some people this will never live up to the expectations but in my opinion it was better than the original, it may have been unrealistic and over the top but if you walked into this movie expecting to see something realistic or something with a really deep story line than you should not bother watching this.I would really hope to see more 9/10.",Predators

441,vsg07,A Failed Attempt,4,15 May 2011,"This review is my opinion and reaction of how I felt after watching the movie, so please don't expect a chronological or rather a logical review.Predators starring Adrien Brody and Alice Braga wasn't a movie I was looking forward to watch. It starts and it ends. Once the movie ends you don't have anything to say about it. Neither good nor bad. Its not going to change anything and the director Nimród Antal knows that. I have read that it was based on an idea by Robert Rodriguez. Well, now that I have seen it, I can say it wasn't much of an idea. I am numb after watching it. I just didn't feel anything.The storyline has a bunch of humans face off two different Predators on a distant planet. Now these two different Predators are supposed to be in fight with each other as well (Don't know why). There are the smaller Predators seen in the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie and the new one who are taller than them. I think the reason Robert came with this idea of Predators abducting humans and hunting them on a distant planet is because then he wont have to explain why are there two different predators now. The movie starts and people start dying every 10 minutes or so. That's all there is to this movie. 20 minutes before the movie ends, there is a scene where Adrien says ""I am fast"" in a husky voice which everyone in this movie has except Topher Grace. At that very moment, I knew how the movie was going to end. And I don't know how much it says for the movie but it ended exactly the way I imagined it.Actor/Character Reviews: Predators: They come and see your heat signature and you die. To be truthful, it has been the same since Predator. Nobody ever came close to the way a Predator was portrayed in that movie.Adrien Brody: The only reason I saw this movie. Unfortunately Adrien lost one more fan because of this movie. (Its not his fault. People expect more after they have seen Pianist).Alice Braga: She looks nice. I think now is her time to do something more romantic (Maybe she already has done it and I haven't watched it. Let me know.).Topher Grace: I cant say anything without watching the movie second time. Sadly, the only way I will watch it again is at gunpoint.Lawrence Fishburne: As always, he brought his A-game to the movie. But it doesn't mean it was good.Now you know what I think of Predators. Please let me know what you think about it.",Predators
442,acu761,Wonderful fun!,10,19 October 2010,"Loved every minute of this movie. Was it Oscar material? NO! However, it was entertaining and fun to watch from start to finish. The characters are pretty thin and not much story develops outside of just staying alive. Royce is the ""cool"" guy in the squad and all the best lines come from him. Although the Topher Grace and the ""death row"" inmate have some classic lines also. I just want to add how nice it was to see the Predators doing what they to best again. No more Alien hunting. This is a true follow-up to the original and everything is kept very simple. Shoot a lot of bullets, miss every time and get killed in a horrible way. Perfect!",Predators
443,frederickmpj-462-926624,Uninspiring. But did you expect more?,4,9 November 2013,"Predators, directed by Nimród Antal is a blurred attempt at convincing those amongst us who just want another burger, that there is more on offer if we go back. Rather than tasting the same, or better than McTiernan's excellent 'Predator', Antal delivers a club sandwich of varying previous 'Paranoid Movies' (Deliverance, Southern Comfort, etc) whilst throwing in a bit of Tarzan to boot! Even the score from 'Alien' is murmured in John Debney's unremarkable score. The characterisations are shockingly formulaic, inducing boredom in their eventual fate. It's so, so predictable, not even Brody's ridiculously deep-toned tough guy voice can save it by adding a touch of accidental humour. I have not heard a put on voice gaff this bad since Ewan McGregor's dreadful Obi Wan Kenobi in the post-Guinness Star Wars films. One review which favours this movie suggests; "" the script provides little genuine surprises in it storytelling."" Thus meaning it is not very good. And whilst not terrible, the question I found myself asking was; ""what's the point of another Predator movie?"" The answer; money. Just money. Not originality or anything new. Still, it's better that Episode I, II & III of Star Wars. But that's not saying much, is it?",Predators

I mean it was better than the AVP movies, but that isn't saying much. The pred-dogs were lame, there was no flying disc, and the sub-plot where the predator helps them was stupid. It was cheesy in the first AVP and it was just as bad here. The 'twist' with Topher Grace was predictable, Lawrence Fishburn's role was horrible, and the movie ended up being wildly mediocre at best. 6.8 out of 10!?! That is ridiculous. Just goes to show you how retarded our world is getting. I have to give props to the prisoner aka comic relief. I mean he was your typical cliché, funny guy but he pulled it off to the best of the scripts ability.Seriously though...there was no characterization, plug in Adrian Brody for Vin Diesel in Pitch Black and voilà...same damn character.

I have a suspicion that 20th Century Fox has paid off IMDb to put a good review and a good rating on the front page for this movie. I'm seriously going to think twice before trusting IMDb ratings after this one.This movie played out like a bad episode of a cheap sci-fi show. The characters were all 1-dimensional stereotypes that we've seen a thousand times before: the token fat guy, the token black guy, the token strong and independent woman, TWO token comic relief characters, including a token racist/idiot white guy...The script, action sequences, plot, everything is so extremely predictable that I wasn't even slightly entertained. Luckily I use VLC so I could watch this movie at 150% its original speed to get through it.There's not much else to say that hasn't already been said about this movie.

Even the predator's vision feels cheap. The thing I loved about it was the concept of being on an Earth-like planet and the scene when they find out.

Anyway this ""PredatorS"", directed by Nimród Antal, was a direct sequel of the""Predator"" series, regardless of those AVP (Alien VS Predator) series. To put it simple, the main story is about an alien species called the Predators summoning the best hunters on earth onto their planet, and begin a Death Match with no return between them.This movie is not bad I would say, good action and tense atmosphere being created. However some plots don't make any sense at all, and the dialogues are very cliché at times! But I did have some good laughs with my friends because of that.Speaking of being the sequel, I still enjoyed the most original one starred by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is so strong and convincing as the strongest soldier on earth.

451,sickeningjar,A Much Better Addition to the Predator Franchise.,8,21 July 2010,"I tend to notice that my reviews are never so popular, because I tend to pick the films apart. You will be pleased to know, if you have read one of my previous reviews, that I actually liked this film.And here's why.It's a better film than the god-awful Alien versus Predator offerings of late. It's better than Predator 2, which even holds a special little place in my heart.A grab bag of nasty crime and/or military types, and one scaredy-cat doctor, are inexplicably plucked from the Earth and dropped onto an alien jungle planet. It soon dawns on them that they are now a part of a deadly game of cat and mouse; the prey for a race of evil alien predators.What I like about this is the way it slowly, but never too slowly, feeds you the scenario. First, Adrien Brody drops to the jungle floor, then we meet the others, then they investigate and come to realise where they are, and why.It never goes too far in terms of gratuitous horror or gore, in fact it spares us the sight of the Predator alien until quite some way in. The casting choices are good. Good, solid character types with some good on-screen interaction, which give the feel of the type of sci-fi horror of the 1980s.The music is exciting and very animated, with such a great sense of adventure and danger.The unexpected (if you've not seen the trailer) appearance of Laurence Fishburne is probably my only gripe with this film. He exists in this film only as a device for some exposition, and to throw a spanner in the efforts of our team.There is one twist which, while it makes total sense in the context of the film if you watch it, is pleasantly unexpected, and proves that perhaps the real monsters in this film may not be the Predators.All in all, a good solid sequel and a breath of fresh air for something which has become all too turgid and very nasty of late.",Predators
452,r_scott73,Once More to the Well,6,1 April 2012,"In some respects, 'Predators' is a reasonably good film. The action beats are well played and the cast generally effective. There is, all the same, a slight disconnect here from earlier films in the franchise, and that relates wholly to the way in which the titular aliens are handled. In the first two films, the predators feel like more then 'mere' movie monsters. In each of the two prior instalments, the aliens appear to be rational, thinking entities.They feel as though they are enemies that must be out-thought as well as out-fought. Diverting though 'Predators' may be, the aliens do not feel quite so intellectual, this time around. It is something of a shame as it is otherwise good to see the series re-visited. The film is not without its appeal, all the same, and the ending confrontation between the human leads and the surviving predator does offer some glimmerings of strategy which act as clever twist on the earlier films. If only there had been a little more of that and little bit less of a 'slasher' film feel to the proceedings.It is a good effort at reviving the series, but is sadly just not quite as intriguing or well realized as what had come before.",Predators

454,jedibearvt,A Handsome production. that crackles with great energy...,10,11 July 2010,"Over the last few years, we've seen many genre franchises get revisited...either by getting ""re-imagined"", ""re-booted"" or just continued with an all-out sequel after a long break.Some of them work well and are big successes (Nolan's take on ""Batman"". the Abrams ""Star Trek"" re-boot), some are good efforts that don't really catch fire with audiences (McG's ""Terminator Salvation"") and some just fizzle out of the gate (Burton's ""Planet of the Apes"").Now the latest in the franchise revival is ""Predator""...the original was a stylish, campy action-fest featuring great stunts and tension with a cast of pro wrestlers, bodybuilders and the Hollywood heavyweight of the era, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Delivering groan-inducing one-liners while dispensing eye-popping carnage under the assured direction of John McTiernan, it found an almost cult-status among action movie enthusiasts and sci-fi fans alike. It spawned one direct sequel and years later, was combined with the fading Alien franchise for a couple more.Seemed like the ""Predator"" concept had become stale when Robert Rodriguez signed on to produce a new ""Predator"" film. Directed by Nimród Antal, this new movie would end up being less of a re-boot, but not quite a sequel to the '87 original, disregarding all of what came between. Adding an ""s"" to ""Predator"" was just the beginning...The result is a very well-done movie featuring a stylish production, an effective cast and a crackling script the forgoes campy one-liners (although a few sneak in here and there, most notably a very un-funny ""rape"" comment), instead focusing on plot development and propelling the movie forward with interesting characters.The effects are well-rendered and not overdone...a real plus is the great use of environment...Antal relies more on the practical in terms of the jungle and uses the now-standard CGI sparingly (or to the point where it's not overbearing and obvious in every shot)...he's created a world that is at once familiar and alien and it's most effective. He doesn't linger on his creatures to show off the effects, they enhance rather than overwhelm, refreshing these days when it seems like every movie features dead-eyed casts staring blankly in a sea of green screen...The ensemble is very well cast, with the biggest surprise being Adrien Brody...not the first actor who would come to mind for a big, bruising action piece, but he gives his mercenary an intense edge that never falls into convention...there's no soft heart here and it adds to the tension.Alice Braga brings some depth to Isabelle, again avoiding the cliché' of being a femme-fatale or ""tough _____""...she just comes across strong and feminine and her character provides a great connection to the original film.Other stand-outs include Oleg Taktarov's Nikoli - the Russian fighter with a dash of sensitivity and Louis Ozawa Changchien's Hanzo..who provides one of the most thrilling and visually stunning set pieces in the film.John Debney's score competently keeps up the tension while paying homage to Silvestri's militant original, upping the tempo and complimenting the quiet moments and the action equally.It was clear that everyone working on this movie took it seriously and put their best effort into it...it just crackles with a good energy. It not only plays as a sequel to the original film, but a good stand-alone adventure for any view just coming into it.Like it's earliest predecessor in this kind of story, ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (1932 - featuring Joel McCrea and Fay Wray), ""Predators"" takes on the idea of predators-as-prey and gives us a great ride with the concept.I hope this movie finds enough success to allow Rodriguez and Antal can visit this franchise again and offer more of the hunt...",Predators
455,Smacki,A step in the right direction for Predator movies at last.,7,9 December 2010,"Before I took a chance on this film there was really only one question I wanted answered...'Is this film going to be another steaming pile of disappointment like the AVP films?'And the answer, happily, is 'No', though after having to sift through all the unhelpful and uninformative 1 rater reviews here, I never would have guessed. I almost gave this film a miss, but I'm glad I didn't. It was actually quite good, and I'll tell you why (no spoilers I promise). I think it is important to go into this film with the right expectations. This film returns to the original Predator format, and borrows heavily from the first 1987 Predator film. There are scenes and characters (and even weapons) which are so reminiscent of the first film that they would not be out of place in a remake. I like to view this as very deliberate homage to the original rather than shameless plagiarism, and I enjoyed the film more and feel much happier because of it. Of course this is not a remake. It is a sequel with some major differences from the 1987 film, and enough originality to make it interesting and unique in its own right.The story is not overly ambitious, they play it straight and the focus is given more to building tension, which it manages to do very well. Because it is a Predator film you kind of know what is going to happen, but it still manages to be suspenseful from the start, and there are quite a few surprises and twists along the way to keep you guessing. The unnerving way the truth of their situation unfolds for the characters is quite enthralling, and reminded me strongly of shows like 'The Outer Limits'.The characters are interesting and all of them are well portrayed. Some are a little cliché, but the main character played by Adrien Brody is actually more human and teeters on the edge of being a full blown anti- hero. My only major gripe with this film is that there is little character development. The characters are (as I said) interesting, but there just doesn't seem to be enough time to explore them very deeply. The most you really get is a shallow glimpse of who they might be, which left question marks over some of their motivations. This does make the film slightly forgettable, as you never really end up feeling or caring too much for them, and sometime it feels like they do things just to drive the plot/action forward, rather than because it is something their character might do.Overall I would give the film a 7 out of 10, it was above average for and action flick and screamed quality, despite a retentively low budget, and I definitely wouldn't mind going to see it again.

456,coolmunky88,Average,4,14 July 2010,"The first predator movie was great, but this sequel does let down the franchise. I watched this with no expectations and found the film to be too predictable. Maybe it is just me watching too many sci fi movies but it did not envelop a new exciting suspense to me. Characters were predictable as they seemed to originate heavily from the first film, the plot was way too obvious and took far too long for the characters to realise. Saying that, the action scenes were good for a low budget but at times the special effects let it down. I found quite a few plot holes in which I found myself almost yelling at the screen for the errors made, the sense of ""plot armour"" for certain characters was blatant. In a contest between this and the original, it would have to be the first movie for sure. Disappointing. 4/10 stars.",Predators
457,BwSwim,Always was and always will be badass!,7,14 July 2010,"The original Predator is a great action movie. The follow up with Danny Glover was not as good, but still pretty bad-ass. Even though this installment did not follow the Alien vs. Predators offshoot I will still go on record as saying they are both entertaining movies.The reason for all of those things is because the Predator is just a flat-out badass character. The Predator is a super-hunter that hunts men (and in some instances Aliens) as its most dangerous game. He can cloak, he has a laser gun, he has heat vision, and he has a retractable sword on his arm. That is not to mention a slew of other cool gadgets only meant to aid in killing.The premise of this movie is that the Predators have abducted the best killers on the planet earth and put them into their own private game preserve planet. Adrian Brody leads a relatively recognizable cast as the mercenary Royce. The band of humans first goal is just to survive, but when they learn what they are into they decide to fight back.This movie is filled with plenty of action and gore that any action/sci-fi fan can and will enjoy. It is by no means the best movie ever made, but if you are an action fan or a fan of the series it is definitely a must see. 7.5 out of 10.",Predators

No more ninja technique in killing 3. Alienator/Predalien hybrid? Useless. In design, technique and utility.So what would have made these movies great  again? 1. Do away with the awful interludes of human interactions 2. Alienator/Predalien should have had been retrofitted with gadgets 3. Take out the human element. Or at least bring back a Dutch- like character!

Alice Braga does an excellent job of playing her character but not over playing her character.

This movie kicked ass. There are a couple of scenes that remind me of true Sci-Fi classics like Aliens. I will not write any real spoiler type comments other than to say there are some really cool Predator kill scenes especially with the Yakuza, which I almost jumped out of my chair cheering. I thought the lead character was really well done and a better real world chance to kill a real Predator than a lumbering Arnold.

The predator is by far the greatest hunter in the alien fictional history. Unlike the last two movies where the predator was on earth in this movie the predator has abducted there victims and placed them on an uncharted planet. For me there are a ton of characters in this movie that I like, the cool samurai guy, the crazy guy in the ship who betrays the survivors. My favorite character was the big Russian guy. At first I was so caught up with all the great characters that I forgot till midway through that most of these characters if not all would die. My favorite thing about this movie though was the fact that there was two different type of predators the ones that we've seen from the other movies and the new ones who apparently are the stronger ones. When I found out that there were two different types of predators, that got me so pumped to see a showdown and sure enough we did. Of course the smaller predator died but it was a good effort. This movie is absolutely one that I can watch again and again and still be interested I loved it. Only problem was they didn't really explain how the humans got on the planet, but still great movie.",Predators
462,hamsapsifu,Very solid follow up to Predator,8,17 July 2010,"I am a huge fun of the original Predator movie since 1987... and I mean huge... I even made my own Predator home movie. Furthermore I can dream the original second by second... and even have chased and obtained the bootleg score in the past. (later on Varese Sarabande released the official ;limited edition soundtrack which is now long out of print) Anyway... to cut things short... I think this was a very good effort. I had a big smile on my face, cause the original Silvestri score was nicely adapted by Debney for this installment. Also the whole movie creates a tense atmosphere just like the original. Nice winks towards the original on several occasions. I liked that they added a Spetsnaz soldier as well and that the guy is a real Russian to boot. (and a Systema/Sambo fighter in reality)/ I give the movie a solid 8.Many of the negative comments are from people who A. expect a different kind of movie... and B. are not real Predator fans. IMHO this seemed to be a movie that listened to input/wishes from Predator fans. The result is great.

463,dfjwebdesign,The REAL sequel to the original. (Fight Me),9,29 August 2018,"I avoided this movie for so long based on what I saw as poor casting and bad reviews. I'm really sorry I did.Casting: Adrien Brody actually plays a badass... I never thought he would, but he totally pulls it off. I also was like ""why is Topher Grace being cast in tough guy rolls?!"" As prior to seeing this, I thought he played a military guy. He plays a weak, nerdy, doctor, he was perfect for the part. Everyone else in the movie was great, none of the acting was bad or took me out of the movie. The Plot: many criticize the plot for not providing any backstory for the characters, beyond what they learn from each other as time goes by. I actually like this, since you're not meant to care about the characters, because they don't really care about each other. They're suspicious, and inevitably about their individual survival. And as far as the ""just being dropped in"" at the beginning of the movie, that's no more ridiculous than any other plot of any other predator movie. And at least it's not some Police Academy type sequel that makes a mockery of the whole thing (Predator 2 might as well have been called ""Predators Take LA"")This movie is true to the original in the way that you know the characters are badasses and they're going to fight aliens, it's been described as a ""love letter"" to the original. It took the humans out of their element, the point is ""how can they survive"", not ""what makes them tick"". It also, though an action film, doesn't rely solely on explosions and bullets to drive the story. It builds intensity through the characters personal fear and discovery of what they're dealing with; much as the first did (though not quite as well, as we the audience aren't seeing this for the first time).The Cinematography: Incredible. This is beautifully shot, the scenery and landscapes are like postcards. Even the darker, desolate ones. The score isn't half bad either. The only real issue anyone SHOULD have with this is the green screen at the very beginning, and a few moments of weak (not BAD) CGI. I only saw this recently, so at this point the CGI is 8+ years old, it's bound to be not as good as current technology, so I give it a pass. And it's so few and far between in this movie, it's an afterthought. Oh, and Danny Trejo. Not because he's bad in the movie, he's good actually... but he's Danny Trejo, he's just too recognizable to play anyone but a tough, killer Mexican.I don't think this flick got the credit it deserved, and mostly fell under the radar. This is easily the best Predator film since the original.",Predators
464,hell_boykissmyass,This will have your attention so its good movie,8,31 October 2010,I say it a movie which have your attention long enough is good enough to be seen and liked but for some that is just another excuse for watching a lame movie. This is a good movie i have been the fan of the only first predator movie back in 1987 when it came out and i have loved that one. Now one day i heard that Robert Roderiguez is producing a movie named predators with Adrien Brody in lead i say what the hell i get excited forget it why I'm telling my story sorry. The movie in whole a lot is amazing with keeping in mind the old predator the fights and intense sequences are good enough to keep you awake Adrien Brody showed that he isn't just a drama person he can do action too.Nimrod Anatol does a great job The Movie Takes its time but delivers it with precision enough.

465,c_rys,A perfectly reconstructed 80s actioner,7,14 July 2010,"Predators - the title using the same logic as Aliens, which presumably means we'd be well advised to avoid Predator: Resurrection soon - was written by a then-unknown Robert Rodriguez in the early 90s as a sequel to Predator, but was rejected, hung around in a drawer for twenty years, & now has finally been made. Quite how Hollywood can have rejected this in favour of the stinking Predator 2 may well turn out to be one of those unsolved Hollywood mysteries. This film is awesome. It takes what made the original Predator so endearing - its glorious, big B-movie dumbness, its mountains of clichés - & turns them up to 11. This is a film saturated with clichés. There is not a single thing in this film you have not seen before. & you know what? It's glorious. After what I have to say must be one of the most awesome cold opens on film (our hero waking up falling through the sky, parachute deploying at the last minute with a resemblance - presumably coincidental - to the opening of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater), we're introduced to our production-line ragtag bunch of misfits early on: the gung-ho American (played by Adrien Brody!), Danny Trejo's Mexican badass from every film he's been in, the huge, burly Russian, Vasquez from Aliens, the quasi-mystical African, the notorious convict, the stoic Yakuza & the geeky doctor. We then see these men & woman stalked through unfamiliar jungles by our favourite extraterrestrial hunters. I won't spoil any of the hugely entertaining action sequences, nor quote any of the highly numerous oneliners (some are fun, some groansome, all familiar), nor will I really offer any analysis beyond: it is what is, & what it is is awesome. It really is one of the most ridiculously entertaining movies I must have ever seen, & the only reason I haven't rated it higher is because I really would feel a bit guilty giving such an unashamedly unoriginal offering a truly high score. But rest assured, popcorn thrills await you.",Predators
466,akivaj,Could have been great but missed the mark,6,9 July 2010,"So...if something works why not repeat it? Only this time in a slightly different setting, but for all practical function the same, and with a slightly different mix of people. That's what this movie does.Everyone's performance is decent. Pretty solid, actually. Music is good but not transporting - it could have had more of a dynamic intensity, although that could have been the not so great sound system at my local theater. Something about this movie just didn't grab me. It's in a jungle, just like the first, albeit on a different planet. It's got a multicultural cast, just like the first (although the greater multicultural range than the first one is the one big thing that this movie did better that I really appreciated). It's got a Gatling style gun just like the first. Adrien Brody kills the main antagonist using the same tactic as Arnie did in the first - covered in mud and screaming ""Come On!"" at the Predator. It's got some cool variations - the alien dog things are neat. The planet could have looked more alien, though (although I guess that one could potentially surmise that the Predators brought flora from Earth to create a habitat for us, but still in the amount of time it took for the largest trees to grow as they did, could not some vegetation have mutated in a way that would look more alien?). And the only other bipedal alien that's neither human nor Predator (but like us is game) that we see we are not allowed a decent look, just a few quick glances.I didn't feel as though any of the plot revealing lines delivered by Brody or anyone else were revealing - you could see this stuff from miles away. You really didn't care when anyone died. Nothing was scary, nothing was surprising. Nothing really new here. But the effects were decent. The action was decent. Good acting, but not great acting. Mindless fun, but I saw it before, with bigger highs and lows - it was called Predator.",Predators

Not only that, Lawrence Fishburne's insane character has managed to elude the legendary hunters and their super technology for years.Sci-fi fans everywhere were hoping for a reboot of the franchise under the auspices of Robert Rodriguez and his Padawan.

The only problem was that the action didn't impress much either. There were a few parts that were passable. Mostly I was just baffled by the poor writing. They piece together what has happened to them immediately, even though it is a completely unthinkable circumstance. They just ask each other questions and for no reason one of them always has it all figured out.All of the problems would be forgiven if there were a character I liked or identified with. If the action wasn't fairly banal I would have forgiven it too. Nothing about the movie was enjoyable. I laughed out loud at how bad it was more than once in the theater.

469,MastaKat74,Predator BLASPHMEY!!!!! What a total pooch screw!,1,9 July 2010,"How many bad movies does this hack director (I mean the guys name is NIMROD, HELLO PEOPLE!) gotta make before people know he sucks. How did Robert Rodriguez stand by and allow this travesty take place? Who were the people that read this script and said ""oh that's a great idea, go make it?"" This movie is NOTHING but a baby step away from the original 'Predator', hardly anything original or new. So lets break it down step by step.Cast: Adrian Brody as our alpha male hero? You gotta be f****** kidding me! Do I really need to explain why the guy from 'The Pianist' does not need be slugging it out with a giant creature from another world? Dwyane 'The Rock' Johnson, Stallone (and his 'Expendables' cast), Russel Crowe, or Eric Bana would have all made better leads! And the supporting cast was WEAK! Topher Grace should only be on TV for reruns of 'That 70's Show', that's about it. Since each character came from somewhere different they had absolutely no chemistry together. Their interaction was about as exciting as watching paint dry. And Lawrence Fishburns character was a WASTE. No explanation, we meet him for 2 minutes and then he tries to kill the group but just gets himself killed with a TERRIBLE CG effect. Script: Basically they just took 'Predator', replaced the characters and put them in a different setting. Which by the way if their hadn't been the 1 establishing shot of them looking up to see they were on a different planet, their entire story/setting could have passed for earth. So you took me all the way to an alien planet just so it could look like earth? WTF. And the Predators were WAY too easy to kill, how bout a lil story line that beefs them up a bit? Or how about a little original story line at all! Amazing how RR craps all over 'Predator 2' when that movie was 10 times better and more original then this POS. So monsters kill the group off 1 by 1 till the big grand.....why bother explaining this, if you've seen the first 'Predator', you've seen this. And watching lil ol Adrian Brody beat up a 7 foot tall, 500 pound gorilla monster predator was like watching Brock Lessnar lose a fight to a 3rd grader. And it wasn't like I didn't notice the several scenes that were stolen from other movies. Example, when the Russian dies.....I DARE someone to say that wasn't stolen from 'Aliens' when Vasquez gets trapped and blows herself up to kill the monster. They even did the fire through the tunnels and up to the people getting away (just like 'Aliens'). Special Effects: Now if nothing else I was at least hoping this would be the one saving grace of this movie, and once again I was wrong. Sub 1997 special effects. The ""wild dogs"" looked as bout as CG as you can get. The predators looked all rubery and fake (unlike P1 and P2), they had NO new/cool weapons. For Chr*** sake, this movie takes place on another planet. Have some FUN with it, go crazy like 'Star Wars' and make the place different and new!.....I can't write anymore, it's hurting my brain to think about this movie. And I'm sure Arnold is on the hunt, but this time he's not after the Predator. He's after a turd named Robert Rodriguez, and he's gunna hunt him like a panther in the night!Conclusion: DO NOT go see in theaters (you'll only be agrivated and want your money back). Do NOT buy on Blu-Ray/DVD. If you must see this movie to scratch your 'Predator' itch, I would rent. Maybe from the comfort of home and the assistance of alcohol this movie might go down a little easier.",Predators
470,mr-hulseycedeno,Finally....Welcome Back Predators,7,22 July 2010,"When i first of heard that a ""Preadators"" reboot was in production, I was quite skeptical.Most people should understand why I question even the thought of another Predators movie, and if you don't i'll give you three letters A.V.P. Now the night of the release, I figured I might as well hop on IMDb and see what most people thought of it, and let me tell you, I didn't believe my eyes. At the time it had a score of 7.8 and there had been well over 2000 votes, which pretty much goes to show that this movie didn't have a tiny fan base. The very next day I took it upon myself to see what made this reboot so special from all the others.The story hops straight into the plot of the film, which was a risky move if you ask me, but they pulled it off quite nicely with an intense free fall scene. As far as the rest of the story goes, it was pretty cliché, but sometimes movies are better off with scenes that people would expect rather than scenes that are so manipulated it ruins the whole feel of the film.However, the ending is a somewhat unexpected one, which i believe was a good idea to throw in a curveball into a somewhat predictable film. Also, I would be lying if I said I didn't miss those bad ass ugly mother f***ers, and that it was great to see them out of retirement. Altogether, this is one of those movies where i left thetheater and thought to myself, ""Money well spent"". I believe its safe to give this movie a decent score of 7/10.",Predators

I can't believe before this film should continue without the Alien movie mixing. I was happy to see this is much better idea than mixing totally different movies. After the dark the story get really scary and killer. The dark jungle is really horrible and the music didn't kill our sense and we don't have to get deaf to hear when the characters getting to trouble. The slowly start of story the only problem, but after the Predators dog attack the movie is never stops. Lot of specially big moments in the film. The director made a very good job. Anyway I loved every part of this film but this is my favorite now!!You can found little mistakes, but put your hand to your heart which movie is perfect.

472,rhyter369,Amazingly Awful,1,23 November 2010,"As a fan of the original Predator, I found myself to be extremely excited to see this movie. Thankfully, the gods spared me some misery; I was not able to catch this movie while it was in theaters, though I tried desperately. To say that this movie did not live up to its predecessor is an understatement. In contrast to my ultimate opinion of the movie, I do think that there were some good elements in the story. Unfortunately, this film falls into the trap of predictability, and loses its intrigue. I liked the ethnic diversity of the characters, however I did not care for the archetypal white alpha male who coincidentally knows everything about the strange planet and the tactics of the aliens that are hunting them. I thought that any one of the other characters of varying ethnicities should have served as the Alpha Male. That would have been refreshing to see. The female soldier could have served as the leader as well, as opposed to second in command. This also would have been a nice change of pace. Ultimately this movie failed not because of the ethnicity of the male lead, but because the story was not thought through. You can not leave the audience with too many unanswered questions; which is what happens here. If you are looking for an action flick that lacks logic and depth, then Predators is your movie. Enjoy.",Predators
473,jimmyro,It's OK It's Alright,6,30 June 2013,"If you saw any of the Predator movies, you know Arnold Schwarzeneggers' first one was the best and it went downhill, in consecutive order, from then. This ones the worst, but still holds some suspenseful moments, as long as you agree to the prerequisite low standard and suspending of logic, reality and plot development. The epiphany in this one; the predators grab humans, who are warriors, and transfer them to another planet to serve as the arena for the hunt. The biggest problem I had with this sequel, is that the writers, despite claiming in the movie that the alien predators learn from each encounter and better themselves for the next one, are markedly less smart or scary than they were in the previous Predators. Moving like zombies and not going for the kill shot when available. The acting, except for Adrian Brody, is 'B Movieish', and that includes Laurencs Fishburn, who I normally like, though it might have been the sub par material handed to him and he agreed to do for the money. Bored tonight ? Nothing better on ? Go on and watch it. If you like the previous ones and love the Sci-Fi action genre You'll probably enjoy it. I do and I did.

474,ajwertman1,Better than I expected,8,17 May 2011,"***May contain spoilers***""Predators"" begins with a bang. A soldier wakes up to find himself falling in the sky and into some sort of jungle. Seven others soon join him, including a drug cartel, a sniper, a member of the Yakuza, a Spetsnaz soldier, a death row inmate, and a doctor. They have no idea where they are or how they got there. Soon, it becomes apparent that they are on a planet used as a game preserve, and they are the game. Hunting them is the 7-foot-tall, bloodthirsty, high-tech, beastie from the fist two ""Predator"" films. Or, should I say, a group of them. I am a huge fan of the first ""Predator."" It is one of my favorite movies. Everything that came after wards, though, was disappointing. ""Predator 2"" was fairly terrible, ""Alien vs. Predator"" was horrible, and I have yet to see ""Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem."" So I did not have high expectations for ""Predators,"" despite the fact that Robert Rodriguez was the producer. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is a return to the look and feel of the original film, jungle setting and all. The characters try to found a way of the planet while trying to figure out who/what is hunting them. The action is tense and gets the adrenaline running. Maybe not quite as well as the original, of course, but still a heck of a lot of fun. It's good to have a nice, R-rated ""Predator"" movie after the wimpy PG-13 rating of ""AVP."" The Predators themselves look great as usual. Speaking of which, I liked how they filmmakers created two different tribes of Predators, the 'classic' predator, and a 'Black Super Predator', which are larger and have slightly different looks. The cast is great. There is not a lot of character development, but the actors still bring a good deal of chemistry and charisma to their roles. This is especially true for Adrien Brody and Alice Braga. Brody nails his tough mercenary part, while Braga brings sex appeal (without developing a romance with Brody) and determination to her sniper. My only complaint for the movie is Laurence Fishburne. He's good in his role as the crazy soldier who has been on the planet for years, but his character is a bit of a cliché and serves no real purpose to the story. Otherwise, ""Predators"" is a bloody good time of a movie and gets the franchise back on track.Rating: 8/10 Grade: B+",Predators

Most of the actors in Predators deliver top notch performances, although not much is known about their background or how they ended up on this homeworld.Predators could have easily been a 3-hour film with much more depth & plot twists. I really enjoyed the different variations of Predators in this film, including the ""hounds"" which brought new life to the series. Some of the best looking predators ever conceived are in this film. There were some homages to the first film which I also enjoyed. I didn't really care for how they ""disposed"" of Fishburne's character so easily, he could have played a much larger & more interesting role. Maybe I just love Fishburne.There are some really cool extras in the blu-Ray which gives some background to the characters including the comic origins. The Yakuza fellow was particularly interested, as well as Danny Trejo. I would definitely vote for Rodriguez to make another predator film.

In this movie the creature is slow sluggish and gets his ass whipped so damn easily that I found myself asking why the filmmakers have tampered with it.On the whole an alright addition to the franchise.

You feel like you're watching the poor mans Predator on the Sc-Fi Channel. Out of all the rip offs, I rank this one last in the series. I'm just glad I didn't pay to see it.About 70% of this movie is a replica of the 1st: the ""over here"" whispers, Jesse Ventura's Vulcan machine gun reappears, an Asian guy plays Billy the Indian and also makes a last stand with only a sword, a Hispanic chick retells the bunch what her village called the Predator...AGAIN, we're in the jungle ...AGAIN etc Spoiler Alert: to back up my claim that it's the Poor Man's Predator, I noticed 2 of the films bigger stars got killed off pretty quick....which translates to a cheap budget. Most of the $$ must have went to extravagant food catering between shooting scenes. It sure didn't go towards the making of this movie As much as people like to bash the Alien vs Predator installments, they were at least entertaining, faster paced and filled with action. Part 2 was also better than this.Adrien Brody is a good actor ( The Pianist, Hollywoodland) but not a very convincing lead in this one.",Predators

There were parts of the movie that were enjoyable, but overall it was a very predictable movie like what would come out of a fresh student out of film school. It has very little imagination, and the special effects are about on par with the original Predator movie. It felt very much like a film derived from fan fiction, and it didn't build into much.The film certainly gets you into the movie quickly, but after that it doesn't really go anywhere. There's the same old tricks from the first film, and nothing really new or exciting.Overall I would say this movie may be worth watching, but only if you haven't seen the originals. Either that or think of it like a remake of the first film, with no special effects upgrades and on a different planet instead of a different continent.",Predators
484,mr_shya,"It's a decent movie, don't spoil it with your expectations",7,14 March 2011,"I am a little disappointed, not by the movie but by most of the comments.Start off with the movie. It was okay, obviously not reaching up to the first Predator movie, but still it was fun to watch, what more do you want? The camera work was actually better that in most of todays action-movies. And the ending (not the final fight, but the actual last pictures) just put a smile on my face.But now get this, if you actually read some of the comments, you ask yourself if this is still the movie-rating-site I can trust, with so many morons posting their misguided opinions around here...For example, some guys are wondering why this highly developed species is abducting humans just to hunt them... Seriously? You don't get that? FUN! Excitement, Challenge;also the reason why they don't use their futuristic weapons too much. (And by the way, Yakuza is Japanese, not Chinese)Also that the characters were just a rip-off from the first movie... basically because there once again was a soldier with a mini-gun. That's called referencing and I gave the movie points for that. Also that they copied large parts of the soundtrack from the first movie... well you just can't improve on perfect.Decent movie, fun to watch!",Predators
485,Omegamorph,A good sequel,8,28 July 2010,"Predators is the long awaited (from the fans at least) sequel of the Predator Series, produced by Robert Rodgriguez and directed by Nimrod Antal. The film starts out in a good, yet somewhat confusing way. We are instantly introduced to a falling Adrien Brody which parachute activates just in time to save him. Then we are introduced to Machet...*cough* Cuchillo and quickly, to 90% of the characters of the film. This was a bit difficult, because you have entirely to rely on your personal memory to distinguish them. The script is really weak on this point, also because half of the characters don't even introduce themselves before being killed (Cuchillo-Mombasa-Hanzo-Edwin), and the two main characters reveal their names at the very end. It would cost much to Royce telling his name earlier when Isabelle asked it to him uh? Anyway Brody (and his nose...) led a good, solid cast that took the film seriously, in contrast to *coff* AvPR's cast... Fishbourne was truly fantastic as the schizophrenic Noland. Too bad we don't see much of him as he is killed like, some minutes after he is introduced, and in a really gruesome way. Loved the ""Hound"" sequence. It was strange and intense in the same way. Really gory also. But let me get this straight on this point - Predators wants to be brutal anytime it could. We see Hounds exploding, Mombasa impaled through the chest, Stan's spine and skull ripped off straight on screen, and Nolan going boom in an incredible CGI showoff of brains, blood and internal organs. Both CGI and practical effects were good - particularly the later. KNB Efx's Animatronics were fantastic and incredibly realistic. Their attempt at recreating the original Predator design, apart maybe from the closing mandibles, was truly excellent. The new design made for the Black Super Predator is cool, although as some of you may know it will always be for me the Black super Squid . The suits were all fantastic, and I truly liked the new mask designs. Regarding the ""Species conflict"" I can't help but have the same feeling I had while watching Jurassic Park III, when the two Predators battled. It comes clear that Rodriguez (or whoever truly is behind the film) wanted with this film to introduce the new predominant Villain that takes the place of the older and brutally kills it (as did the Spinosaurus in JPIII). I am far from being *that* type of fan; anyway I can't help myself, it felt a bit forced. The battle anyway was handled very well on screen, although I preferred the sword fight that happened earlier (my favorite scene from the film). Though, they truly need to come up with more original demises for the main monsters. I mean, decapitation? That's old as Monster-Movie making itself. That said, Royce mangling out the Black super Predator was truly epic. He brutally torn it to shreds. Another thing I can't help but notice is that instead of ignoring P2/AvP films (as Robert Rodriguez stated in some interviews, Predators instead goes in the opposite direction, with the phrase ""Enemy of my Enemy is my friend"" being a start. Or the multiple visions, or the shooting wrist blades. In he end anyway, a good sequel, recommended to the ones who enjoyed the past installations in the Predator series.",Predators
486,jeppj,23 Years Later & They Finally Got it right!,9,13 July 2010,"There is not much that I can say about this movie other than I loved it. Being a die fan of the first movie, its great to see they went backto what MADE the first one a true classic (group of utter BAD ASSES (well except for the Dr.), bad ass weapons, only glimpses of the Predators).Couple of things I that bothered me.1. Why do they call the main Predator ""Super Predator or Berserker Predator""? He was not any stronger, larger or more ferocious than the previous two (or four if you consider Scar & Wolf from the AVP/AVPR movies). In fact, he & his buddies were noticeably much smaller than the first & second predators.2. Why did Noland refer to two different types of Predators saying ""There are two different types. Like the difference between dogs & wolves"" ""They're are bigger ones that hunt the littler ones"". Eh..not really. Again, the second ""tribe"" of predators that were the main antagonists were not any tougher that the predators from the other films. Yes, Mr Black did defeat the Classic Predator but honestly, considering the guy had been hanging up tied to a metal monolith for days or more, I'd kinda give him some slack. My point is the physical differences between the two (classic vs berserker)is more like the difference between a European, an Asian or an African human. Normal physical variations of a species.3. Noland. He survives for ""10 seasons"" on this planet being cool & cold blooded & within 30 minutes of meeting the main characters, goes ape shiot, & gets himself killed.Anyway, sorry for the rant!

489,JVMblaamaba,The Right Way to Make a Sequel,8,19 July 2010,"The Predator Series has suffered from bad sequels like Predator 2, AVP and AVPR but the new film Predators is one of the best sequels I have ever seen. The Characters in this film all have something to do to help build and progress the story. Adrien Brody plays an excellent tough mercenary who delivers a powerful role as well as three other interesting characters being a female sniper who shows morals and humanity of human beings while every other character in the film wants to survive and leaving behind someone is something they will do but not her. Another is a prisoner who serves as a great comic relief who is very disturbing and dark and this actor delivers a chilling role. The last character is my favorite and is a doctor played by Topher Grace, another dark comic relief with interesting character development and a slight twist in the film. The New Super Predators presented in the film are bigger, badder, and tougher then the classic predators from the original film and even pose a more darker threat and appearance on screen. The Story is just like the original where a group of soldiers come in contact with an alien hunter but this film shows new elements in the film like new hunting tactics that the Predators use during the film and a few interesting plot twists and homages to the original film. The action scenes are quick and fun while the film does lack the showing of the New Predators more often and there is one character who plays a badass scavenger who shows his survival tactics but is quickly taken off screen after surviving ten seasons on the Predator planet. I wished that the Predators would use some new weapons and the explosive arm wrist that was used as a last tactic in the original. Now I hate how some people are saying this is a remake when it has been clearly stated in the film and by Robert Rodriguez. This is a great and clever sequel that stays true to the original Predator film with its over the top characters, great action scenes, wonderful music, and good cinematography! This is the right way to make an action film, a sequel, and a Predator film.",Predators

If anyone has seen the first 2 Predator movies, they would know that Predators hunt for sport and with honour. Apart from a throwaway line about sending in the dogs first there is no evidence of this in the movie.SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!There is much is in this film that could have been deleted and the time used to write a proper plot. Lawrence Fishbourne - Lives in a wrecked spaceship for (well, cycles - guessing about 5-10 years) and the Predators NEVER thought to check the wreckage.. seriously? Added nothing to the film except to give the survivors some grenades. (nice to see him though) The doctor being a psycho. Plot twist? Who never thought after 10 minutes.. ""hold on, Predators wouldn't hunt a doctor or put a non combatant in harms way. So why him? Oh.. Maybe he isn't actually a doctor.."" (see Predator 2 - child with gun and pregnant police woman WITH gun scenes) Two kinds of Predators.. A plot device that was completely un-necessary to give an escape route and will probably have to be ignored or wreck the series. Which nicely brings me to my final moan - Escape route? I seem to remember that Danny Glover got a 250(ish) year old black powder pistol as a reward and his freedom for beating the Predator that stalked LA, so why?, when they defeated the Predators did they need an escape route and not just get taken home (by the honourable Predators as previously mentioned)End Spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The Preds just did not act or feel like we have come to know them (Even including the nonsense of AVP movies) They could have easily been replaced by any generic movie monster, a plot other than 'dropped in jungle - survive please' could have been easily achieved and rescued this film if the needless scenes had been removed. Too much recycling of the original film (including the lines)Harsh, But IMHO fair.BTW - after the film, the characters had grew on us so much it took a collected effort from all 6 of us to name 3 of the 8 characters.. never a good sign)Disappointed.Squinty",Predators

This nearly but not quite manages to be the Predator movie I had been waiting for. The good points: It starts as it means to go on by dropping us, literally, straight into the action. From the moment the movie starts it moves along at a lightening pace never really stopping for breath. The Predator's are great. From the 'classic' Predator to the new more vicious ones, the design is awesome. Laurence Fishburn's character is also really cool. The not so good points: The script follows the original Predator movie almost scene for scene in some places making the whole thing too predictable. The characters are all scumbags and frankly deserve to die. There is no one here who doesn't have it coming making it difficult to care when the end inevitably comes. The Predator's aren't in it nearly enough. We spend far too much time with the human characters who, as mentioned aren't enough to carry the movie. Finally the gore has been toned down here which is a bit disappointing. However, all that said this still manages to be fun, and the Predator's when they are in it are brilliant. So not the comeback I had hoped for one of cinemas coolest creatures, but still worth the time.",Predators
492,JakkySG,Again tricked by the trailer . . .,7,23 August 2010,"We initiate knowing only what the characters know:A group of cold hearted murderers with the awkward exception of a nerdy physician, mysteriously land into an unknown planet only to become the prey of the evolved new breed of alien Predators.Adrien Brody inhabits the role of the loner mercenary with the typical ""I don't give a damn"" attitude, strangely the dialogs felt of those of a traditional macho blonde American soldier though Brody makes everything work out just fine.Now the other characters were just as typical or even more overrating exaggerated that have no grand impact on the plot what so ever, in fact one character has max 3 lines in the entire film.While the characters might not have had enough time to grow on you, they were killed off one by one in what I thought was a social accepted order. Now Im not going to spoil it by telling you who died when but you'll get what I mean. Why do they keep casting Topher Grace? He HAS no grace what so ever, all I saw was his habitual acting. The same expressions, the same hand movements as Eric Foreman and Eddie Brock. There were lots of starts that had obvious ends or didn't even matter if they happened at all, except towards the end. In fact the second half of the movie is great compared to the first half, the action scenes get a bit fired up and there are a couple of mild twists. Still like all the conflicts in the film, there never really is a solution to anything and the rivalry between the characters has more importance than that of the predators.The story has a surprisingly amateur feel to it. Though never did I feel like they were being pressured, hunted down or chased.The predators never seemed to intimidate either,who looked like big muscled macho men with masks on. Ladies: Brody shirtless. Hell Yes!!Nimród Antal did manage to give us a feel of claustrophobia with what didn't look alien but still attractive sets and colorful skies.

Fishburne's character was introduced and then disappeared again with little reason. None of the characters felt compelling. The roars and movements of the enemies were so damn cheesy. The story was as bland as can be, and accomplished literally nothing. They're still stuck on the island, they haven't stopped the aliens from bringing more of them in, they're effectively where they started.
There was no high-stakes moments for me aside from ones that are extremely predictable, like when the girl (didnt bother to learn her name ... no reason to, she has no character) was slipping off the cliff, but then just at the last second the guy (again, no character development) comes out of nowhere and saves her heroically. Wow. Never seen that before. Or when the (same) guy is about to be killed by the alien, then gets shot at the last second. Who would've guessed?Overall a very predictable, boring, cheesy, straightforward movie that ends in the same place it starts with zero character development.

494,GoxGox,Solid,7,29 June 2011,"Who watches SF action movie, part of the Predator franchise, for an intriguing plot or dialogue?Story is well known, seen many times before. A group of people are thrown together, no one knows anything about each other, they're chased by some (to them) unknown beast/people and they're trying to survive. First few minutes of the movie reminded me on Canadian movie ""Cube"" and that was pleasant, but then characters started to act a bit different then the common logic would tell you and suspense atmosphere soon turned to frenetic action. If someone watched some other Predator movie, he gets the idea, nothing specially new.I found Adrien Brody as a nice refreshment with a bit untypical action role for him. He played it fine, not spectacular, but fine. Also, has anyone else noted that he usually ""suffers"" in his movies (The Jacket, The Experiment...)? Similar like Sean Bean always dies. If he was untypical in that role, there were few characters that were untypical for the jungle setting, as Japanese Yakuza guy or doctor. But that makes the plot a bit more interesting and i didn't saw that twist in the end coming, although i have doubted something similar. Laurence Fishburne was a nice addition, but he got bigger recently?! Apart from that, action scenes are nice and that's most important in such film, although it looks from the start that predators could just finish them off easily, they're ""sportsmen"" and had to test them a bit first. However there's one scene that totally doesn't fit there, that Yakuza with a sword one, not only that it's stereotypical (most of the movie is), but the end of that scene doesn't look good to me (or logical, for that matter).All in all, nothing spectacular, nothing specially new, but enough refreshments to keep you interested, and rather good twist in the end make it worth of watching. If you're not a predator franchise or SF action movie fan reduce the rating by 2. Also, some might not like Brody in such action role, but IMO he did fine here. -7/10",Predators

The 'predator' in the movie is exactly the same as was in 1987, its moves were predictable and exactly the same in the original due to which there was no thrill or so called 'fear'. The only difference was that this time they were more than one. After the first few minutes it was clear what would happen in the movie, who will survive, and how it will just end at one point without making a point.

496,bajgone,The second best movie with Predator...which is not much,1,16 July 2010,"As a fan of the Predator's universe I expected something more thrilling and spectacular. Unfortunately, Predators is a lackluster B-movie, which does not explode delivering its audience 'pure fun' - the most essential component of brainless productions.All three aspects of a solid movie fail with varying magnitude. The oversimplistic plot basically insulted my intelligence and wasted the interesting premise - the group of characters wanders around, navigating in a jungle with no clear sense of purpose and murky objective, which is absurd. You never get the chance to assess whether the characters are the survivalists or the predators (as the title implies). Eventually, loose ends and quasi-twists made me wonder 'what's the point?' The character building is based on classic cartoon stereotypes - the outlook conveys everything you need to know. And you know from the outset that most of them shall die soon, but I expected a bit more than a vague and distant sketch via single sentence or sequence. Here it was similarly pronounced as in the original Predator, but Arnie, Duke and Ventura made it work. The acting didn't help either - it ranged from OK (Brody) to utterly bad (Braga).Finally, when watching the action sequences I got the feeling 'been there, done that'. Absolutely nothing blown me away or even made my hands sweaty - simple as that.The intentions were right, but sadly speaking Predators doesn't deliver as a fast-paced sci-fi action movie, even though it returns to the roots of the series.6\10 - deserves 5, but I'm a bit nostalgic.",Predators

499,i-dunning,Adrien Brody - Jewish action hero?,6,13 July 2010,"Not a great film, but something occurred to me about it that I haven't yet read about. A lot of people have commented on how Adrien Brody seems like an odd choice for the lead role as action hero. What no one seems to want to explain is why he should seem such an odd choice - the obvious reason being his peculiarly Jewish appearance. In Hollywood films Jews are stereotypically represented as victims - sensitive, artistic, intellectual, passionate maybe, but ultimately powerless in the face of big violent forces - usually Nazis. Brody's role in The Pianist is much more in this mold and served to fix his star image as the sensitive, long-faced, long-suffering Jew. Some recent films, however, have started to subvert this stereotype: Tarantino's Inglorius Basterds is the most obvious, and then there's Spielberg's Munich as well - films in which the Jews fight back, brutally.At first sight Predators doesn't seem to have the obvious political context of these other films; but look more closely. Throughout the film, Brody's character - Royce - is cagey about giving away his background, and we never definitively discover his origins. When he meets the female character, Isabelle, however, he instinctively identifies her as ""IDF"" (Israeli Defence Force). They meet a whole bunch of others from different backgrounds, but Royce only bonds with Isabelle and at the end they walk off together, a semitic Adam and Eve in a hostile anti-Eden. The predators, in contrast, while being ""aliens"" are clearly coded as being - if not obviously ""Islamic"", then certainly generically ""non-western"" in appearance. Their desire to hunt and kill humans is almost entirely restricted to westerners - except for a token African and a Japanese character who I think speaks just once in the whole film.With Adrien Brody - the Jew-as-hero along with his IDF sidekick, in opposition to the hordes of undifferentiated sadistic predators, the whole film then, can be read as a kind of politicised metaphor for Israel and its position in the front line of western civilisation against the forces of evil (Islam) - a kind of post-9/11 Zulu. I look forward to a sequel in which the predators and the humans agree to coexist happily in their own territories with mutually agreed boundaries . . .",Predators
500,celluloidjunky,Predators is a cheap franchise cash-in that offers little new and ultimately devalues an already tarnished franchise.,5,24 July 2010,"It's hard to believe Hollywood, who invest millions in 'movie people' always seem to reach the end game, the fruit of their collective labours by fielding unoriginal fag packet scripts. Amazingly Predators employed four writers. Two worked on the script, two on the characters. Script-wise this is a re-run of the original. In the first instance we have the Russian with the Gatling gun. Who carries Gatling guns these days? The last one I saw was in a 1987 movie with Schwarzenegger. Then we have the mysterious Mr. Yakuza, a reflection of Billy's character from the original. His fate parallels Billy's (he stops running, turns round, takes his shirt off, pulls his blade out and waits alone for the hunter). Isabella's character is also a clone of Anna and if this sounds samey it gets worse with the overuse of set pieces borrowed from the original. Let's hope the writers aren't given the opportunity to reinvent the Aliens universe. The Anima Mundi is dead to them.The plot is simple. Some troops with big guns land in an alien jungle. Said troops work out they are all nasty people. This is why they were chosen. Only the doctor seems out of place despite the fact he knows all about paralysis and human experimentation. Finally they discover a dead soldier, having walked into an elaborate trap (unfeasible but still the best part of the film), following which they are attacked by alien dogs (to allegedly flush out their hiding place) and then, finally, the predators come out to play. The film only contains three predators despite the trailers alluding to far greater numbers.The original movie built up its characters as supreme warriors, but also warriors you cared about as the ultimate hunter picked them off one by one. The dynamics were simple. Kill or be killed. In trying to recapture this winning formula with Predators (no doubt a homage to the successes and strengths of Aliens as a sequel to Alien), we are given characters with little redeeming features. Neither do we have an indication of their strength. This means there's no baseline for comparing the strength of the predators, whose qualities will be unknown to unfamiliars. The entire premise is on shaky ground too. Being dropped in with big guns but limited ammo makes the situation tougher than the original movie and yet they survive for longer periods. The predators, despite an array of sophisticated tools, still resort to simple measures to trap and kill. The balance between their hunting, toying and killing is uneven, the confusion this creates unintentional. The original showed the predator's presence through its thermal vision, keeping the monster hidden until the grand finale. As film-goers, we are now familiar with the Predator design but this doesn't mean it needs to be over-exposed as in Predators. Here the filmmakers have tried to recreate the original movie without this mystery. If the intention was to plagiarise they should've plagiarised such essentials as this. Predators is littered with clumsy set pieces. The first kill is messy, the next is barely visible. These sequences lack the excitement of its predecessor, relegating the predator to just another cliché'd monster. The stunning death sequences for Dillon, Blain and Hawkins aren't even close to being matched and by the time the doctor shows his true colours, it's neither well-explained, nor his motives understood, it's just thrown in because there's little else to see or do.Robert Rodriguez is an enigma. His early career showed a maelstrom of style which made up for any shortcomings in content. Perhaps he should have dropped producing rights and directed Predators to give it half a chance. There certainly seems to be an abundance of poor visionaries in Hollywood from Paul Anderson through to McG and the Strause brothers. This breed are imitation directors who never seem to push the medium to what is possible beyond targeting a pop corn audience and keeping to a 15 certificate to guarantee more bums on seats. In safe hands mainstream blockbusters always have the potential to be great, just look at Christopher Nolan''s work.If I had to praise Predators I would point to the jungle cinematography, the borrowed score and the performances of the cast, who work well with the limited script. The Predator design is still an obvious highlight and the final fiery battle works well. An intentional nod towards the aliens movies also works. The film opens at a pace but loses momentum after the first 30 minutes and is irrevocably struck down by Fishbourne's unnecessary, scavenging schizophrenic. There is no creative advance in this movie either. The new predator is simply a bigger version of the original and serves no real point beyond that aesthetic. Insight into this alien race is poorly handled, even the the AvP series touched on this better. And at least Predator 2 developed some new weapons and vision styles.The faith in pop directors for projects which would have once been considered prestigious, will do little to reconnect with the disenfranchised. Predators is the movie making equivalent of painting by numbers and like the tabloids, it has a preconceived idea about its audience and delivers for that audience via a conveyor belt. It's also a relatively cheap movie, and it shows. I can only hope that any future additions to the Aliens franchise are not given to the same creative team. These films, just like the Predator universe, deserve visionaries that loved the originals and respected those worlds, who are willing to sit back with a clear head and develop new stories that enrich the franchise.

I liked the first 2 a lot, hated AvP and thought AvP 2 was OK. I went into this movie with no expectations. On to the review:The film itself starts off with good pacing introducing us to the characters. The characters range from good an believable to lame and cheezy. Topher Grace as the medic seems to have taken a role that was originally written for Michael Sera complete with many ""I'm an awkward guy"" humor breaks. Thankfully the obvious main characters are the good and believable. There is also a cameo by Laurence Fishburn which is laughably bad.The FX in this movie were good when using Practical effects. The Predator costumes were great though I did not like the look of the ""new"" Predataors. The CGI was pretty awful and noticeable in most every case. The gore is the least I have ever seen in a main line Predator movie and only second to AvP in lack of it. This is not a bad thing and should make for an easy TV edit as I feel the majority of the R rating came from F bombs dropped throughout.The first hour and 15 minutes are pretty slow sprinkled with some action then the last 20 odd minutes everything goes down.The movie is well directed and shot. The plot is pretty thin, but it is hard to expand on the plot given. There are some stupid things the characters do, some lame dialogue and gaping plot holes but very little is downright awful.The ending is action packed but nothing that wowed me.The Predators in this movie were pretty dumb. Problem with Predators is they have a pretty unestablished history, so you can make rules as you go along when you need them to be convenient to your story. The new rules about how the Predators act and hunt really make them seem weak(not in the physical sense) and uncoordinated. Most of the Characters in this movie should have been easy prey. I have always felt that the hunting rituals for the Predators was a sacred, possibly religious experience for the Predator(based on movies/comics/books). These Predators seemed they wanted to use any means necessary and still did a terrible job.In the end most of my Friends said it was better than AvP which isn't saying much. One(who was a supposed fan of the series) fell asleep during the movie. Everyone seemed to enjoy it but I don't think anyone felt it was worth the price of a movie ticket. I felt it hovers around the AvP2 level in terms of how good it was. Its an OK movie but even for Predator die hards I say wait for it to hit the cheap theater or wait for the DVD.",Predators
502,ratherdashing-1,A Satisfying and Entertaining Film,8,10 July 2010,"First of all the movie had a great introduction that really gets the movie going. Like Avatar the atmosphere and mystery in the movie makes it very exciting. This movie has a very clever plot and how the predators imitate the humans was great. At some points a felt characters were killed off to quickly but it also increased the intensity of the movie. I wasn't used to Adrien Brody as any kind of hero but he did a great job along with Laurence Fishburne and some of the other actors. I also think that they needed to do more with Topher Grace and if you are reading this before you have seen the movie like you mostly would then you wont know what I'm talking about but you will when you see it. The special effects were great and the predators were just as brutal, frightening, and as hard to kill as they were in the first predator movie. Overall this was a great movie, hopefully if you are a fan of the first movie then you will like this one.",Predators

It doesn't to anything new or particularly interesting (though I liked the premise of predators abducting people and dropping them on the preserve), but the action is solid, the acting is solid, and the characters are interesting AND they're not (too) huge idiots.My biggest gripe is that I really would've liked to see survivors be rewarded with a trip back home in typical honorable hunter-style, which would seem to fit with predator behavior. Yeah they abduct you, throw you out of airplanes while you're unconscious and then hunt you, kill you, skin you, rip your spine out and make a trophy out of your skull, but they usually give respect where respect us due - and respect is due to any human who manages to defeat one of them.

I won't get into too much of detail but I will say that any predator fan or even someone who likes a good action/thriller should watch this movie.

507,ioannougiorgos,Predators are back!,8,14 September 2010,"OK let's get this out of the way first: Predators is GOOD. Now is it better than the original? I am sure fanatics are gonna be arguing in forums for months on this subject. But the real question you should be asking yourself is: Did you have FUN watching the movie? My answer is YES. So here goes my attempt to review this movie: Plot: A group of hardcore mercenaries and assassins gets dropped in a jungle looking a lot like our jungles on good ol planet earth. Soon they find out they are not alone and all hell brakes loose. Pretty much standard stuff nothing out of the ordinary. Although some characters introduction and goodbye feel a bit rushed(poor Morpheus) and leave something to be desired. The thing with the ''normal'' predator helping them felt also a bit rushed and lacking as it was short...People these things need to be expanded. Camera: solid work, no complains. Effects: nice battles and with the predators showing off their new gadgets but they could have spiced things up with the scenery with some effects changing the jungle giving it an alien feel. Acting: This is an action movie. Nothing to change your life but the actors feel convincing in the limited lines they are given to express their roles. In general I had fun and enjoyed the movie. It could have been better but it could have been a lot worse. Watching a sword fight between a jakuza member and a predator is always fun in my books. Recommendation: See at movies.",Predators

And then Brody making friends with the tied up predator, who immediately understands him and sacrifices himself so Brody can make it to the ship..Maybe this movie was meant to be a joke and I just was not drunk enough to find it funny.

I put AVP up before this one the story of AVP was by far better then ""predators"" which i felt was just a group ""dropped into a meat grinder"" and forced to fend for them self none of the characters stood out like the previous 2. I hope if they make another one they put more thought into a story then this one. I didn't like how the predators kept evolving in how intricate the Predator and his weapons and technology i thought the original was perfect and why they kept adding to it just makes the first 2 seem dated and they aren't. They did this with a lot of the Marvel movies and i didn't care for that either.",Predators
510,dominicsedillo,"This movie is awesome, HOWEVER, Topher Grace and Laurence Fishburne...",7,2 March 2020,"This movie is a really enjoyable sequel in the Predator franchise, but Laurence Fishburne and Topher Grace pretty much bring this movie way down.-----PROS:
1. Adrien Brody is a believable (and surprise) badass mercenary.
2. Alice Braga adds some humanity to the group as well as being a cool-as-ice killer.
3. The Berserker, Tusk, and Falconer Predator are a nice addition to the Predator mythos.CONS:
1. Topher Grace's performance in the third act.
2. Laurence Fishburne's attempt at a performance.
3. Walton Goggin's performance.-----""My love for you is like a truck, Berserker...""
I really like Adrien Brody. He's a tremendous actor with a very unique and unusual look.Even though most would consider this movie a B-movie, his performance and ability to actually act elevates this movie. He doesn't look like Arnold Schwarzenegger (and definitely is not as physically large as him), but I 100% buy-in to him being an experienced mercenary.In the third act finale, when he shows his physique it is another testament to his commitment to the role. Adrien Brody showed up for this role 100%I have mixed feelings about Alice Braga's character, because just like with Brody, her performance as an actor elevates a movie like this. Her humanity is both a great character trait and a character flaw. I really wrestle with whether or not I like her overly moral and emotional motivations and responses, because I think they are only there because they are written to be part of her character. To me, it doesn't make sense that a career sniper/government assassin would have SO many qualms about killing and leaving people behind.The reveal that there are other types of Predators and that these new ones feud with the classic Yautja's is pretty cool and unexpected. They seem more vicious and their hunting style is very different from what we're used to.I do sincerely wish that we had gotten more of these Predators in the sequel ""The Predator"" instead of the giant Predator and his lame Predator Dogs* (*the ones in THIS movie are way cooler-looking and scarier).-----""Well, this would be fun if I wasn't so miserable...""
I cannot state enough that I hate Topher Grace's performance in the third act of this film. This thing that actors do when they reveal that they are not a normal character, but were a psychopath the whole time, is grating and comical (in a bad way).You see this type of performance in movies like ""Scream"" and ""Urban Legend"" where the bad guy gets revealed to be someone you thought was a part of the group. They go on a big dialogue about their psychosis (usually in some hyper-crazed or dazed voice) and reveal their masterplan. Topher Grace does this and it is very distracting and silly considering he acts like a person that doesn't belong in this situation.Another contention I have with this movie is that more time isn't given as to why his character is here. By the end of the movie we realize it is because he is a killer, but no other character ever questions why he's on the planet, which for this particular group it should be VERY suspicious. There is a deleted scene where Brody's character confronts him, but it is sadly not in the final film. It's inclusion would have given more tension and a much more dramatic reveal in my opinion.Laurence Fishburne is a real actor, so I'm not sure what he's doing in his role, because (and I'm sorry Mister Fishburne) it is amateur hour. His take on a mentally unstable person is completely laughable and takes me out of the movie every single time.Also, his inclusion only exists to give exposition to the audience about these different types of Predators. He serves no other purpose, which makes it kinda a waste.Walton Goggin's character is similar to Fishburne's character in that they are mentally unhinged, but Goggin's character at least does some stuff other than move the plot along.Walton Goggin's wasn't famous yet when this came out, but he was always relegated to these types of roles. I hate the way he is capable of functioning as a killer in this group, but because he's a serial killer from the South he's also an incestuous rapist who is also racist too. It's so egregious.OVERALL:
I recommend this movie. I think it's got decent action and a likable cast even if they aren't expanded on too much. The movie feels similar to the original ""Predator"" that you'll have a lot of fun.",Predators
511,QAOSbringer,A Great movie especially if you are a long time Predator fan.,9,5 September 2010,"This movie supposed to have at least 7.5/10 from IMDb. It was a wonderful film. The characters prepared interestingly but background-shadowed to add mystery to them. The visual effects gives us a 80s nostalgic feeling. Predators and story-twists makes us thrilled. Also most important, it has deep connections to Predator 1 as story-based and Predator 2 for the Predator community. I felt like watching Jurassic Park as a kid, and after the movie I got a excitement to quote every scene of the movie like the Jurassic Park. So, I think it prepared with a nostalgic style.If you loved Predator 1 or 2, played Alien vs Predator 1-2 with Predator, bored from new age AvP movies and the game, so this is a perfect time for you.

512,tobyrodwell,"I know it's not going to be winning that many awards, but I don't care.",9,31 August 2016,"OK so it's the back to the original jungle hunt fun of Predator (with an added bonus of the original sound track) with a twist, none of the people have any idea how they ended up here, however there is a pattern, they are all killers, or predators, apart from Topher Grace's awkward (not in a bad way) doctor. So far the premise isn't a typical Slasher flick, lets see how the rest holds up. Well once our mismatched rag tag group of mercenaries, soldiers, criminals and doctor who can somehow identify alien plants and alien poisons (and the only solution there is if just by chance that poison also exists on earth which could be possible but... kinda hard to believe), they realize soon that they are being hunted, the predators have become the prey. Basically most of the plot now revolves around the group trying to find their way out and then trying to escape using the Yautja ship. seems like a decent plan right? not when there are bigger, tougher and cooler predators than ever before, and now finally there is a proper predator group that isn't in a WasteofaGoodSpeciesVSCompletelyTonedDown movie. Now here is where a lot of viewers lose focus, the Lawrence Expositionburne scene, personally I liked learning about Yautja culture in a good movie, I like things like that, but I can see why others hate it, they don't like too much depth in their action horror movies, which is fine I guess... Now it all ends with 2 big flaws, one which I don't consider a flaw and one I do. Firstly the Doctor's ""sudden"" change into a psycho, if you took the hints throughout the movie and didn't just go ooh at the gore and death, then you can see that the doctor is not an OK dude. The other flaw was that the malnutrition-ed normal predator stood up to the bad ass berserk predator at all, the berserk can't be young blood, it wouldn't be berserk class otherwise, also the berserk takes forever in killing Roy, it slowly walks up to him at the end to kill him... typical clichés I guess...oh well the end fight was still awesome. I know this movie borrowed a lot from the first movie, but I don't give a damn, it was so fun to watch. anyway onto one of the more important aspects of a great predator movie, the characters. a lot of people thought Roy (Adrien Brody) was an ass hole and not a good hero, we have to remember that he is a mercenary, and along with most of the other characters and unlike the original predator team, he isn't a good person. and by the way, Brody and everyone did a fantastic job in this movie, Oscar worthy? no. but still great and compelling. while most of the characters weren't developed, they didn't really have much time to. they were all wiped out in like a day and why would they want to share past with people they just met. that's why you got to know Dutch's team more, they knew each other and showed more personality because, well they were with their buddies! they were brothers! its different here because a lot of these people don't like each other, so why would they try to bond while being hunted. besides, we do get development on the stars of the show, the predators, and that's always great. All in all as a predator fan I thought this was great, the acting was great, story was cool,action was amazing, the Yautjas looked bad ass. and in case you are wondering Yautja is the predator species :), and I enjoyed it all the time. better than the stinking AVP and slightly better than the underrated predator 2.

513,stale-1,boy's toys but a'lot of kicks,7,7 July 2010,"Lets get it straight from the outset, this is a boy's film, and boy's love it when a production hires good character actors, gives them some big ass guns and has them picked off one by one, starting with the worst actor to the best. There is enough in this film to keep the fan boys at bay, and a great deal of homage to John Mc Tiernan's original to prop the film up high. Kudos's goes to the writing team for understanding that drab exposition can kill an actioner like this, and it is delivered in a way that keeps the pace going and allows another well known character actor to have a piece of cameo pie. There are obvious tokens in the film, that smells a little of studios fear that a wide release film must be politically correct on all matters gender and ethnicity, but it works well in the story and adds some multi cultural flavour as the characters battle their camouflaged foe. The effects are great and mostly practical, leaving the carton style CGI found in most medium budget monster movies in the dust.

514,marshalls_1,The first good Predator sequel in 20 years!,8,11 July 2010,"As a fan of science fiction films, I've always enjoyed the Predator movies (Predator 1 & 2). Over time and as the AvP movies came out I lost a lot of interest in the Predator films. The overdone and overblown special effects and CGI in the AvP and AvP Requiem had turned what was a original Sci fiction monster movie series into a cheesy under budgeted B-list films. This was very disappointing and did little justice to the series.As I immediately started watching the first five minutes of Predators, I already could tell this was going to be enjoyable. Sure enough it got even better, at times it even had its scary moments. I really appreciated the fact that this movie had a dedicated and fitting cast and crew for the parts of what a good Predator movie like this needed. The story written by Robert Rodriguez carries his signature with his sense of interesting story development and entertaining action scenes. As for the stories originality, it defiantly shows with the different sets of characters through out this movie. Unlike the AvP films, Predators caries its story with the human characters. Creating deep and engrossing story lines from each character that slowly unfold as you watch the movie. Like the first film, this movie also has the same music score which adds to the sense that its a direct sequel to the first film.This film filled me with hope that the Predator franchise isn't dead yet and that there is still possibilities for many more good Predator movies to come in the future from Robert Rodriguez.

516,brodogg6,Second Best of the Predators (Big Spoilers),7,29 July 2010,"OK,since the 400 other reviews that start with ""THIS IS NOT A REBOOT"" have not sunk in with many people reviewing the film let me repeat THIS IS NOT A REBOOT, BRODY IS NOT DUTCH, BRODY IS NOT TRYING TO BE ARNOLD. Now that that is out of the way let's start with the film. The storyline is based off of ""Most Dangerous Game"" and while this is not a new idea, it certainly is a new spin on it, and it works. The planet is reminiscent of the original jungle we saw Arnold and company get destroyed in, but harder. What our friends have walked or dropped into is a planet used for big game hunting by our new more vicious Predators, but humans are not the only thing being hunted as other alien races and even the original predators we have come to know have been hunted as well as they are their rival tribe. Let's move on to what I think is the most important part of why this movie rocks. The acting. Some how, some way this movie was able to pull in actors that play their parts well (Yes, even Topher)and much like we saw with Aliens, the character's acting is actually stronger than the action. For all those who thought Adrien Brody was a terrible choice to play the lead roll (including myself) are in for a shock as Brody not only pulls off the role, but does it with a harder edge then you can imagine. He is no Arnold, but the sharp darkness of his character more than makes up for his lack of muscles (although he is ripped in the movie). Brody plays a mercenary with a shady past and a jaded attitude. He is blunt, gruff, cold, and only looking out for himself, if the rest want to tag along fine, if not stay and die. The rest of the cast do their parts and represent their characters well. The rest of the warriors are made up of a drug cartel enforcer, an African warlord, Russian Spetsnaz (which they got the details right on)Yakuza,Israeli sniper, death row inmate, and for some reason a scientist (You'll realize later). Just like the original, the band of pros begins their hunt with the Predators, leading to their deaths one by one. Make no mistake, this movie is bloody just like the first two, but does not have an overkill of CGI which is a breath of fresh air in this era in films. There are many winks to the original as the original storyline is tied in (Arnold's debriefing), the original scores are mixed in, and a few tactics as well. The movie does not stall out, it keeps pace, and keeps you on edge by using the fear of the unseen. Much like the original, the Predators are rarely seen and when they do, it means someone's going to die. I was not disappointed I was relieved at the fact that after 2 tries somebody got it right and exceeded my expectations. Don't listen to the haters,if you love the first two you must see this.",Predators
517,truejoo,Great Predator Film,8,11 July 2010,"I enjoyed this film largely because it makes no attempts to familiarize its audience with what is going on. We are instead thrust into the situation as blindly as the characters are, except how ever we know the films called Predators, so we do have a good idea of what the characters are up against. Additionally, the casting is fantastic. The film contains a large variety of characters that add a whole lot of flavor to the film. Whether its Danny Trejo's Mexican cartel background or the mystery surrounding Topher Grace's character, there is always something to keep you something to keep on your mind while the characters try to avoid falling prey to the Predators. Additionally,I really enjoy Adrien Brody in any role he is in, and his venture into the sci-fi action scene is no exception. After having seen this film and Splice I cant wait to see what he does next, I like seeing the added range of an already proved actor.Now having said all this, the film isn't without its disappointments, I feel the film needed to spend a little time explaining how our characters got to this reserve planet. Further, the ""Most Dangerous Game"" theme has worn a little on me and I feel with the actors involved they could have added an additional thoughtful theme to lift this movie from B-movie fun to a complete more thought provoking film.Bottom line: Predators is a very well made film, with likable characters and plenty of blood splattering fun. Just don't expect too anything too profound in way of plot or theme. But seriously, you are seeing a Predator movie, so I doubt you're expecting that.",Predators
518,Tortoisemogwai,Predators - it's pretty good,7,9 July 2010,"With Predators we escape from the slightly underwhelming concrete jungle of Predator 2, the shitty snow not-a-jungle jungle of AVP and whatever location they had for its sequel that no-one with any sense bothered to watch and return to Arnies domain of just-a-jungle jungle. Except we are in space on a mysterious world with several funny looking moons and suns. Being back in a jungle, and being thrown into it straight away (no bullshit waiting) starts Predators off on the right foot. Luckily it manages to stay on that foot and ends up being a very enjoyable, if flawed, b-movie style popcorn flick.After following Brody's descent in hell we get introduced to our motley group of lovably cheesy characters one by one. There's Topher Grace, Alice Braga, Morpheus, Danny Trejo and some guys with long names. Each holds their own exploiting their character traits to a level that's acceptable to make them seem real enough people instead of extremely annoying walking lumps of flesh. I think Brody does well, he's no Dutch – and certainly seems far smaller in comparison – but does a good enough job to warrant him leading the pack and making the film well worth seeing. Essentially all the characters are lambs for the slaughter and you're just waiting for them to die, but they're well crafted enough for you to care when your favourite one dies. Unfortunately my favourite character died first, damn. From here the story is kept simple and follows them looking around for a bit, finding out where they are for a bit and then trying to survive a bit. Well, it's not that simple. There are some ethical issues thrown in along with a sort of twist for good measure and it manages to be directed and shot with creative flair making it feel far more personal and therefore likable compared to much of Hollywoods action based output. Congrats Rodriguez & Co.In relation to the first film Predators makes a fair few lovable references to it. Best of all reusing music from the original to great effect, making me feel like I'm watching a Predator film – which is a good feeling. Like Predator the film paces itself fast and never really slows down, and even when it does there is enough threat from the situation to warrant a fair amount of tension. It's good that they went through a check list of what to take and homage from the original to use in the film and what not to take from the AVP films, as well as introducing plenty of new elements, and it's nice to see the Predators up to their no good shenanigans, even if the effects are slightly to CGI based to seem as realistic as the optical effects (which may sound strange) of the first two films the creatures look nearly as good as ever and fans will defiantly enjoy the Predators and their trademark hot-spot viewpoint, which, unfortunately, isn't used nearly enough throughout the film. Fans of the first will also enjoy the credits, which hold a nice musical surprise. On the down side Predators is fairly shoddily written leaving more than a couple of plot holes and leading to slightly hammy acting at times, however, it manages to make up for this is many ways and ends up being great fun if you can forgive its setbacks. If you can't though, I can't say that you will enjoy it as much, although I'm pretty sure that you will be able to tell whether you will love or hate it in the first five minutes, it has some class titles.One final thing: That shot of Adrian Brody, in the trailer, with about 10 predator guns pointed at him might be a little white lie and counter to the amount of guns pointed at him in the finished package.",Predators

The effects, blood and gore and pace of the movie make it a treat for action lovers. Don't expect any complicated story or Oscar winning acting. Just sit back, enjoy the popcorn and absorb it all.

They also did a horrible job with the CGI, the predators, during cloaking/ uncloaking, looked like an they were in an Xbox game.They either need to pay money and do a good predator movie or just stop all together.This is not a good theater movie, this movie is best watched on DVD where you get see the extras. Hopefully they pack the DVD with a lot of informative extras to explain more about the predators.The only good thing was some of the action scenes, other then that, they could have just released this straight to DVD.",Predators
522,rooflivers,That is what I call hunting season!,7,8 July 2010,"I'm a huge fan of the original! It is one of my favourite movies if not the favourite! And I gotta say that this movie was pretty awesome! It is not flawless. Neither is the original. But there the whole Predator thing was new so it was different. In this movie was a whole lot of suspense as well and as the matter of fact I got scared sometimes which I think says everything! I also think that we can forget now the failures called AVP, AVP:R! This movie had balls, gore, good actors, great SFX, and the slightly altered original soundtrack by John Debney! Loved it all! Antal Nimrod is a very talented director even though he should let himself roll more! He has the quality but no trace here of the dynamism we got used to from Mr. Rodriguez! The Predator characters were great! KNB did a great job creating them and this time they were brave enough to redesign them a little bit. There are three things I felt a little bit as a let downs that the screenwriters as they were going along with writing realized that they need more and more since they knew they cannot make the original again to make a full length feature. So they kept packing all this different elements but then they probably noticed they need to finish the movie so they said ka-pow! and it was done! The other thing I was probably the only Predator fan who said: C'mon guys what's the pain? Let Brody to the pot! And I had all my trust in him. But he just hasn't got it! Not bad, but not the real thing. At the same time who would fill Shwarzenegger's shoes?! The third bug is the question: Why they have to quote from the original movie all the time?! Don't be afraid to make your own quotes up!!!Anyway, it is a great action-sci-fi-horror movie and I did not expect no less from these creative people were making this! If you are a true fan it's a MUST! If you just want to see some good sci-fi-horror then go and see it anyway!",Predators

Which are both awful!!!If u like the predator, if you know what the predator is capable of and know a bit about the race and its creation you will see this movie and cry on so horrible it is, if you know what im talking about you will understand.The story is just taken out of a Cheerios box. The predators and monsters are lots of CGI. If u have 16 years old and just started to feel what is the predator as a character you will like it other wise wait for the DVD.This movie can only take a positive comment on having Adrien Brody as main character other wise i would have left after 20 minutes in the movie.Even now i cant understand on how he agreed to make this poor movie.",Predators
524,toothache_face,Burn Hollywood Burn,1,21 July 2010,"Being a big fan and teased with the trailers and promotion for the latest saga in the Predators franchise i sat down with excitement to watch...and it all went wrong from the opening scene. I cannot begin to explain to you how many errors and so so obvious plot holes there are in this movie,to explain them all would literally take me all night so here's just a few. It begins with guys falling from the sky from thousands of feet landing barely without a scratch into the jungle undergrowth. I let this one go. It becomes obvious that this is foreign soil and the Predators are beaming fodder for the hunt onto their own planet,OK so now the original film has been rendered totally obsolete. Why would they come down to earth,the original premise,when they can sit on their butts and transport humans into their own back yard? The story was already shooting itself in the foot and it had barely got going.Talking of shooting,ammo that never runs out. It seems a never ending supply of bullets keep miraculously appearing and restocking weapons. More shaking of the head (and tutting) followed. Fishburne enters the movie with a Predators helmet making him visible when he removes it,hang on i thought the manipulation of these cloaking devises where controlled from the Predators arm unit,well they have in the past how many films. Oh and these Predators now have feelings for the humans and can be persuaded to join forces and sympathise quite easily. Honestly it really is this silly. The acting isn't too bad,the action scenes are run of the mill Predator but it's biggest let down is this shoddy excuse for a plot and it's execution. I walked out,had enough.Obviousely Hollywood chose to disregard the idea of continuing Dutch's rescue and the army going in to sort this thing out. All right well that's a total rip off of Aliens but so what,it would have been a damn sight better than this total rot. Burn Hollywood burn...you've ruined it again! What's next Predators v Spiderman? Please don't do any more,this has become a joke now.",Predators
525,ronniesaini,What a waste of time!,1,24 October 2010,"I couldn't believe on these guys making such a pathetic movie in 2010! The director Nimrod Antal with his total lack of vision and imagination tried to show the Predators Planet by just showing 2-3 Predators :) and only a very small section of the vast green forest, hilarious actually! this Alien Race was shown as the most advanced and having high tech gadgets back in the Original 1987 movie, and their planet is just woods? lolz - No civilization, No ships, nothing :)Director definitely had a very limited budget to only show 1-2 Predators at a time on screen, and taking Adrien Brody for the lead role in this one! lolzDirector tried his best to give reference to the original movie by having chats about the sole survivor, as he fought with the creature and survived, by taking the original soundtrack - but he was totally unsuccessful to create any thrill, or action in any of the sequences - all the action sequences were copied from other movies and the original one as well.Mistakes and my frustrations: 1. The chasing dogs sequence - copy of the Jurassic Park 3 sequence 2. The team falling off the cliff into the water, same as the original movie where Arnold fell in water just escaping a hit from the creature 3. A stranger gives shelter to the team & trapping them, scene from Pandorum 4. The chasing dogs were not all killed but when the team arrives at their camp site, there are none! all vanished and never came back on screen 5. Only one ship is shown from a very distance and blown off :) and the list goes on!",Predators
526,aeon395,"Had potential and gave us hope, but not much else.",7,16 July 2010,"I have been an avid fan of the Predator movie franchise since the first. I can remember watching the cassette until there wasn't a single scene left without an unbearable number of track-lines. When I had heard that this movie would bring a familiar sense of action, at the same time embellishing on the franchise, I was overcome with a strange sense of hope.I am a guy. This is what I expected: Blood/guts, cool weaponry, and at least one strong character that can lead the rest of them to the slaughterhouse in an action packed death march. Prior to seeing it I had postulated four outcomes: -The guy survives (eh, OK) -the girl survives (AVP was too recent to allow this) -Everyone dies (good) -The guy and the girl survive (garbage).Now despite having promised a significant amount of gore, this movie delivered very little. The one scene that I had looked forward to seeing (when the Predator removes the spinal column/head from the victim), appeared/sounded little more than what one would expect from removing a twig from red jello. I think back to the last movie regarding the Predator Universe, AVP2, and wonder: why'd you use less this time? That movie had severe issues with budget which was clear based on the cast, however, at least it satisfied with a decent body count.There were some elements of the story added, such as some vague information provided by a crazed Morpheus about the civil war between height-oriented Predator factions, and some insight into the their methods of hunting. With that said, nothing seemed too original, and that is the bottom line. Sure, we've seen the plasma-casters, we've seen the predator vaporize many an unlucky co-star and extra alike, we've seen the non-white character accept his fate and stay behind to do battle with the ensuing Predator. We've seen the traps made from tree limbs, and bear-traps exist on Earth, by the way. In fact, everything in this environment, with the exception of the predators and some strange beetles that are encountered surrounding some unknown Alien, may as well be on Earth.Most of the movie is wasted on senseless character development that amounts to nothing, as anyone would realize that the given situation does not allow for much time, nor care, as there are much bigger fish to fry (how do we get back to Earth?...) That, and each character, as they are developed, so do they perish.There's a lot to say here but my theory is this: go see it if you would like them to put out another movie in the hopes that it will be better than this one, and at the same time accept it as a bland, unoriginal, addition into the world of Predators.",Predators
527,christian_e,"A filmmakers anticipation: If an action flick isn't dumb, the audience wont understand",1,12 July 2010,"Just have been in the cinema. I was an IMDb victim. Yeah, because of the (in sum) good reviews. Now i know it was the 'this is different, so i have to praise it in order to get praised' reflex. The difference is to use (one) quality actors.This movie is bad. Worser than T4. There is not one believable scene and now we come to this argument: believable.Scifi is meant to be a genre were interesting situations appear. situations, which normally wouldn't happen, like dropping on an alien planet and survive against alien hunters. As long as people react real, it could be very entertaining how they manage to survive and what you, the audience would do. There is no deus ex device in this flick, but it wouldn't make any difference:8 people staying rooted on the spot shooting with their Gatlings until out of ammo on one wolf like creature with no success - a moment later one shot does it right??They use rotten one liners like ""i am ready to die, you too?"", ""doesn't matter who they are or where there come from, i kill them all""Dumb scene - dumb dialog... ...and so on alternating until the credits.Dumb action scenes are NOT interesting, they DO NOT make tension, they are just annoying.Antal Nimrod took the opposite way what made predator or aliens so great.Nimrod must think very bad of his audience. He don't want us to think while and after about this movie. Adrien Brodys mission is to talk us from one scene to the next with constant conclusions about the situation which are only knowable if his character 'royce' has the script in his pocket (besides he immediately identified a plasma weapon).Brody, a known actor of format must have denied reading the script or is quality management not meant to be used by the actors? His role is unbelievable nonstop-nonsense, paired with the batman voice.The rest are mega-close ups, close combat scenes and jungle.Some days ago i saw Rambo (first blood) again. Yesterday the original Predator. Action movies with interesting character and/or story are not common these days. Action filmmakers today get caught by the coolness trap. Just to say its cool doesn't make it cool, more the opposite. A little less polemic in an example: Dutch (Schwarzenegger) and Dillon (Weathers) are Predator original characters. They are always trying to be cynical with a smirk on their face. When things go dangerously wrong, they act like everybody else, but face the situations and don't try to be cool anymore but to survive until the air is cleared. That makes them lifelike and touchable. Royce (Brody) just try to be cool, because the script says so. He doesn't make any facial expressions, nor he makes any interesting character streaks. He is just here. Like any other character in Predators.In this movie, they (Nimrod and Rodriguez) tell you everything: who is cool, what you have to think, why the character do what they do except of doing it the logical and less dangerous way, but they owe as an explanation why they are allowed to handle millions of dollars for this outcome.There are some other major problems, like the use of thinkable every possible clichés (fe: Russians wear blue-white striped shirts), the use of archetypes, shaky-cam, and so on... Forget this flick. It is garbage. Or don't believe me and see for yourself but be aware that you subsidize future film projects of this 'format' and nothing will change.",Predators
528,avndragon,Best Predator movie since the first!,10,12 July 2010,"If you are a man in his 30s, then Predators was probably one of your favorites back in the day. If you lost interest in the francise when gary bussey and danny glover took over in part two, rejoice my friends. This movie takes us back to the jungle and back to what made us love the first one. This movie had it all, great looking predators, cool characters, it connected the first movie on a few levels, and we even see the gatling gun that Ventura had in part one. Also Brody uses a few quotes that Arnie said in the first. This gives me hope that we may just see the Governator in the next one, because they leave us wanting more and keep the door open for another predators movie. AWESOME MOVIE!!",Predators
529,Megatron1234,PREDATORS Rocks!!!!,10,6 November 2010,"This movie was sweet. Both a nice retelling and sequel of the first Predator movie. Some people don't like this movie because there's not a lot of action. I hate that. There's more to an action movie than the action. There's suspense and build-up. This movie had those. They brought back the music from the first one and kind of modernized it and had scenes and lines similar to the first to try and please the Predator fan. Worked for me. While making this movie, the writers and staff were told to only use the first Predator as a reference which is why it was so similar. I loved the way they brought back Long Tall Sally by Little Richard at the credits. Nice homage to the helicopter scene from the first one. The acting was good and so were the lines, but it could've done without the 30+ F-words. The ending to me was a disappointment, though. So, all in all, really good movie if you're not picky about redone scenes from the original and redone music. 10/10 stars forever and ever!",Predators
530,adamddodson,The worst film I've ever seen,1,10 July 2010,"So I went into this film with really low expectations, as most of these Sci-Fi blockbusters nowadays are just genuinely awful, but Predators managed to become my most hated film.The characters were pretty dull, not once did I care in the slightest for any of the main group, with most saying about 1 line in the whole film. The character of Royce I think was an attempt at some bad-ass who had landed on an alien planet but after 10 minutes of the film seemed to know the place like the back of his hand.I read that this film was being classed as a sequel to the original Predator and nothing to do with the Alien Vs Predator films, although constantly throughout there are major links to said garbage movies. I can't even put into words how angry I was that I paid £7.20 for this disgrace to the franchise.The final fight scene is pretty much a bit by bit remake of the final fight scene in the original Predator, complete with mud covering and even using Arnolds dialogue from the movie.I spent most of my time with my head in my hands thinking how could a movie be so bad, I can't understand how people think this rubbish is worth 10/10, this film is for people who's favourite actor is Vin Diesel, Laurence Fishburnes small part was unexplained, boring and disappointing.A film was poor acting, pretty much no acting, no development of any key points or characters.I'd rather watch Twilight than watch this movie again.",Predators

Then the lead actor's acting was poor. Adrien Brody was poor. he was so cheesy, everything he said was in a low scratchy voice, and the actors around him were poor too. the Asian guy said nothing! the ending was awful. the fact they have to get off the planet. isn't that what the main plan was anyway?! then the last movie soundtrack was a joke.

532,redmaim,"Not perfect, but a solid return to form",8,15 July 2010,"This review contains a few spoilers. Basically, I don't know why so many people have a problem with this movie, after the comical Predator 2 with Danny(I'm too old for this)Glover, and then the risible AVP and AVP2, I was really happy to hear that Robbie Rodriguez had come on board as producer and that Troublemaker Studios would be handling it, and God bless 'em, they've done a great job. It isn't the most original movie (it mines the first Predator's storyline a little too much at times) but Nimrod Attal does a solid job of directing, and John Debney the composer has had the good sense to keep Alan Silvestri's themes going in the score whilst adding a few neat little touches of his own.One of the reasons the movie works so well is that it retains the humour of the original, it doesn't take itself too seriously. It simply puts some interesting and almost likable characters (merc, special ops, Yakuza, serial rapist) into a nasty situation and gradually lets them figure things out for themselves. There aren't any huge surprises to be had here, and as usual it's the big name star and the pretty lady who make it to the end (it should have been the Yakuza if you ask me), but this film is well paced and very gory fun, and nearly stands up to the original.Casting Adrian Brody as the lead was always going to send waves of trepidation through the ranks of fanboys all over the world, but he does well with a character that could quite easily have been a one note meathead, at first shirking the company of his fellow killers before finally realising that some things are more important than just surviving. Well done too to whoever came up with the idea for Laurence Fishburne's character, the only criticism I make here is that they could have done more with him. It would have been even better if Brody's character had taken over where Fishburne's had left off (except minus the madness), perhaps helping to guide the next group out at the end of the movie. Overall, one of the reasons this movie is such a nice surprise is because the last instalments were so bad. It doesn't quite make up for those, and it won't grab the best movie Oscar, but it's the second best predator movie ever made, and that's got to count for something.",Predators
533,tringeisen20,Hard not to compare it.,5,12 July 2010,"I had such high expectations for this movie. Being a huge fan of the first two movies, I really thought that this would expand the Predator story and universe. During the movie, I was bored, and when it was finished, I was disappointed. Predators starts hopeful. The slow building tension, interesting characters who are thoroughly fleshed out, and great sets. But I thought the movie fell apart when the Predator aliens were shown. How do special effects get worse with advancements in technology? Not to say the special effects in Predators were bad, but the camouflage effects are not nearly as good as they are in the first 2 films. I will give the movie credit for the dog creatures,though. Really cool designs. Another grudge, where were, like, HALF the shots that were in the trailers??? I can count at least 7 things off the top of my head that were in the trailer that looked awesome that were not in the film. I know this happens quite a bit, but COME ON! The stuff they seemingly took out looked badass! If you want to watch a Predator movie, watch the first 2.

Predator was the worst in the series, but this movie proved me wrong. This one is the worst. Why would you want to fight with these creatures and then stay with them by killing the others, and that too in a far away planet. Yeah, that got me remembering, the setting of this movie is not earth, but another planet that is very much similar to earth with same atmospheric and geographic conditions that humans can survive without oxygen masks.So overall a bad movie, in my opinion.

537,jonny_3300,"very mysterious film with lots of action packed scenes, but is not very scary for a thriller",7,6 August 2010,"When i saw the trailer the thing that attracted me was the actors who were in it who i have seen in many other good films like Adrien Brody,Danny Trejo, Topher Grace and Lauren Fishburne. the good thing about the movie is its very mysterious as you do not know who sent the humans to the planet or why. there were a lot of action packed scenes, if you are a predators movie fan then understanding the predators techniques in the movie is easier as the movie progresses. also the thing that makes the movie better is its not on planet earth, it is on an unknown planet showing how the predators hunt on another planet. setting is good using mainly jungle like environment and one scene showing other planets above them in the sky when they realise they are not on planet earth.There were also some bad points in the movie that might not necessarily have applied to everyone who watched the movie, considering it is a thriller only one scene made me jump ( and that was when one of the humans went up to touch a predator that has been tied up to a rock and then it starts screaming ). also one scene that confused me that a scene from the trailer was different from the actual movie when actor Adrien Brody is being aimed at by predators in the trailer there are several lasers being pointed at him which implied that there are more then 3 predators in the movie or several, but in the actual movie there is only 1 laser pointing at him from one of the remaining predators which disappointed me as i thought there would be a lot of predators hunting them then just 3.",Predators
538,arthur-zwitser,Only a shadow of the original,5,18 August 2010,"Couple months back I decided to watch Predator and Predator 2 once again. The '87 classic still entertains without too much plot line. Couple of black ops get dumped in a jungle and end up fighting a far superior alien.Predator 2 really failed in making a good sequel, totally changing the idea of Predator and taking the alien downtown. Too much (silly) storyline infused made for a boring ride.It's obvious that they really tried to stay true to the original in this 3rd real installment of the series (I'll happily forget about the AvP series). A group of 'chosen' men and women, varying from a mercenary, a death row murderer, a Russian soldier, a yakuza and a couple more skilled fighters topped off with a doctor are plunged into a jungle. It doesn't take them too long to find out they're on a different planet that serves as a 'game reserve' with them being the game. They are being hunted by a small group of Predators and will have to find a way working together to survive.I had high expectations for this one. I really expected to be amused. Of course I didn't think this would be a masterpiece, but a fun ride at least. Well, it wasn't. The majority of the protagonists were downright annoying, Adrien Brody's character being the most irritating throughout. Despite the appealing sound of the plot the movie fails to deliver. It's simply boring and an annoying drag. There are VERY few highlights (Danny Trejo!) and the way the story develops is just way too predictable (give the Jap a samurai sword).Perhaps it was best to just leave the Predators alone.",Predators

I do not think that the director Nimrod Antal did a horrible job but I do think that he had a lot of ideas but did not come to an conclusion of which ending would be the best. I also loved the way how the director gets to the point of the film in the beginning of the story and how he gets down to the point of science fiction and action adventure.

540,torvum,Nostalgic Reviewers Shouldn't Rate Movies,6,16 October 2010,"Let's face it, the original predator wasn't super good - the acting was sub par, the story line wasn't great, and the script was cheesy. In reviewing this movie many other reviewers point the original's brooding sense of tension, it's character development, and the emotional connection it creates between the audience and the film's characters; WHAT? Are you on crack? Arnold can't inspire an audience to do anything but laugh or high five. Not for a second did I feel pity, fear, or sadness of any kind watching the original. The character development is shallow, understandably, since the movie never spends anytime building up the relationships between characters in any meaningful way. Anyone who writes otherwise is clearly deluded - no movie can stand up to your nostalgic memory of watching the original when you were 15. However, despite these flaws, the original leaves the viewer satisfied, and I think Predators does just about as well as the original.The few glaring flaws in the movie for me were:1.) Topher Grace's character failed in his function throughout the movie. He was added in order to provide the audience with a humane contrast to the war-hardened killers of the film and to provide a twist ending. In both of these function the character fails miserably. Instead of providing contrast, he mostly just annoys the viewer and negatively effects your suspense of disbelief. His role at the end is even worse. Forced forced forced. Why would a predator want to hunt a weakling serial killer who works by tricking people? Clearly that doesn't offer any kind of hunting value for a predator. Also, why would he wait for the worst moment to reveal himself as a serial killer? All in all I think the movie would have been better without this character.2.) The ethical dilemmas explored in the movie were way too forced and failed at provoking any kind of emotional response from the viewer. I could have tolerated a few instances, but the movie was packed full attempts to jerk emotions via moral and ethical devices.3.) The predators never seem like they're very skillful or particularly intelligent hunters (something which I think all of the movies suffer from to some degree). I'm supposed to believe that this race of creatures is advanced enough for interplanetary travel, while simultaneously swallowing their clearly brutish and simple behaviour and tactics. This disconnect always bothered me; for a race that are supposed to be the most advanced hunters in the galaxy, you'd expect for their tactics to be more interesting.What I liked:1.) Adrian Brody is surprisingly good. I was quite skeptical, I admit it. I have to say: he really pulled off his part. He delivers his one- liners beautifully and performs admirably as an action hero. Not once was I hoping Arnold would show up. 2.) The movie is visually gorgeous. Vibrant colours and beautifully textured backdrops provide the movie with an eye-catching context for the action that really helps you enjoy watching.3.) The very end of the movie. They're still on the planet. They didn't get away. And they're likely to die. For me this was the best ending of any of the Predator films. Satisfying, but not cheesy; happy, but not in an everything-is-wrapped-up kind of way.All in all it was a fun movie to watch and I don't regret it.",Predators
541,PSurtees,Finally another great Predator movie,8,14 November 2010,"Anyone who comes to this site for a review of Predators is probably going to be very confused. The reviews seem to fall into two distinct and opposite categories:1 Star reviews written by people who have very little grasp of the English language and the rules of grammar. These reviewers ask a number of ridiculous questions, such as ""Why was the Predator so hard to kill in the first movie but so much easier to kill in this one?"" The interesting thing being that all of their questions have answers which are fully explained in the film. These people say things like, ""the acting was terrible"", or ""Laurence Fishburne was the worst thing in the whole movie"". Apparently we're supposed to believe that someone who can't string meaningful sentences together has a solid grasp of directing, story development, script, acting and plot. And if you want to take the word of some cretin who gives this movie 1 Star then go right ahead - you don't deserve to see this great film... Solid reviews in the 6-8 Star range from people who understand movies and who back up what they say with articulate explanations.If you believe the 1 Star reviews then you won't see this movie and if you're a fan of the original then you will really be missing out. Predator was and is an absolute classic. Predator 2 was enjoyable but my problem with it was always that I couldn't really convince myself that Danny Glover was tough enough to defeat the Predator. Putting that aside the ending was fantastic because we learned that the Predators actually have a code of honour. We also discovered that they had encountered the Aliens at some stage - a tasty little morsel which whet our appetites for more. And over the course of a number of years the idea for an Alien Versus Predator movie gained momentum. Originally the story was that the Predators had a planet where they hunted Aliens as a rite of passage to 'Predatorhood'! Aliens were spawned and the Predators then hunted them. Then, into this mix, fell a group of humans who became stranded on the planet and had to deal with both the Aliens and the Predators. It was a great idea for a story and that's why it was so disappointing when Alien Versus Predator first came out. It was a very average movie and that was a big disappointment because the potential was so vast. The second AVP outing was also very average and it seemed like two great franchises had been ruined - what with Alien 3 being pretty poor and Alien 4 being not much better. So I didn't bother to see Predators when it was at the cinema because I figured it was going to be rubbish. Then, on the weekend, I finally sat down to watch it and wasn't expecting much, so I was amazed at this truly excellent movie which puts the Predator franchise back on the top of the pile. The secret being that this film is very much like the original AVP story, minus the Aliens.The beginning of the movie is pure genius. People are complaining about the character development but this is not The Godfather. The beauty of modern movie-making is that you don't need to spend ages developing characters in an outing like this. We don't need to have feelings for all of the characters - only the few who the story is about. Rather than wasting the whole first act on developing characters this movie just bypasses it and jumps straight into the second act! It is a risky idea but it is pulled off beautifully. The movie starts in top gear and doesn't let up the whole way. Adrian Brody is an inspired choice as the main character and he totally pulls it off. Once again they chose a risky path and pulled it off beautifully. Which pretty much goes for this whole movie. Anyone who says it's just a rip-off of the first movies is just ... well ... a moron! Yes they have taken some of the great scenes from the first movie and paid homage to them in this one. But aside from those there are a whole bunch of things in this movie that are completely original. Some of them are quite risky but they are all pulled off beautifully. Jumping straight into Act 2. Casting Adrian Brody. The introduction of Lawrence Fishburne's character - and I will just say on this point that he is absolutely superb as the ""one that got away"", the guy who has somehow managed to stay alive on this hell planet. Exactly as you would expect he has pretty much lost his mind. He has also pretty much given up hope and is now just in a pure survival mode. Lawrence Fishburne does an inspired job with this twisted character and is a real highlight of the movie. It is also a great example of the way this film keeps pointing the story in a particular direction, making the audience think that it is heading in a standard, formulaic direction, only to completely shatter the illusion and take us somewhere completely different. Sheer brilliance right up to the end, where even at the finish we are given a completely unexpected, totally original and very risky finale. In short it is a brilliant movie. I would stop just short of saying that it is as good as the first one but it is right up there with it. It is original. It adds to the Predator franchise. It pulls off a whole swag of new and very risky ideas. It's a great movie that's destined to become a cult classic. I sincerely hope there's another one on the way.",Predators
542,FilmManiac24,"It was good, but the old one was much better.",5,27 October 2011,"The fact that Adrien Brody was the main character got my attention to see this film because he is a very good actor. Like many movies, the old version is like ten times better than the ""remake"", including this case. In first place, they should have explained the story since the beginning. I mean, why the hell they were sent to that planet? The acting is descent and the action is good. It's always cool to see shootouts in the middle of the jungle between humans and predators. But there are many ""cracks"" and illogical actions from the characters. There is a scene where they are running in the jungle to meet the spaceship and get out of the planet, but there is this Asian guy who decides to stay and fight the predator. Who does that?! It's like choosing dead instead of life. The ending is kind of bad. We all know that without the spaceship (which explodes) they're not getting out of the planet and they will get murdered by the predators. The effects are really good. The predators look very real. Concluding my review, it's a good science fiction film, but not the best one.",Predators

This is not a remake, it's a sequel, but you really don't need to have seen the previous movies to understand what's happening.2. This was never intended to be an Oscar contender.3. Of course there are plot holes, see above.If you can understand and adhere to those rules, it's a fun movie to see. The ""team"" on planet Predator figures out quite quickly what is happening to them, and manage to function somewhat cohesively. But of course they're up against Predators. We see some new predator technology, get a small glimpse into Predator culture, and see some solid action.Some of the aforementioned plot holes do nag at you throughout the film, which DOES detract from its enjoyability. The ending is a bit anticlimactic, but I'm sure they're simply setting up another sequel. The appearance of Laurence Fishburne is very random, doesn't add much to the movie, and simply makes you wonder why the hell he signed on.",Predators

I'm a huge fan of the original, with Arnold. Loved it when I first saw it, at a movie theatre, and loved it just streaming it on my computer in my bed. And THIS movie, PREDATORS, was equal and maybe even surpassed the original in quality, all the way around. From the beginning, about 10 minutes in, I was riveted. The cast, the story, the acting (that doesn't look like it at all), the suspense, the appropriate action scenes and lack thereof, the cinematography, yes, every aspect of this movie WOWed me! Not a movie to watch while you're eating dinner. This is most definitely a popcorn movie! So make your popcorn, find a comfy seat and watch it! Your time won't be wasted.",Predators

This testosterone fueled epic of a movie while extremely entertaining is not without its faults. Topher Grace being the forefront of the issues, he just felt unnecessary and annoying. The pacing is another problem I had with the film,once Lawrence Fishburne is introduced, begins the exposition. Though it is very interesting,it still pulled the brakes on the whole production.All in all Predators is a fantastic film for fans of the original.

Adrien Brody in his new costume made me feel ""odd man out"".,his talent is wasted by such roles of expressionless,'made up' tough guy role.Rest of the cast is just making it.Anyway the character frame should be credited for.,though the casting must be blamed for the letdown felt by viewers. Laurence Fishburne,his talent was wasted absolutely. The serial killer twist around the climax was utter nonsense and for sure,it didn't help a bit. All the best scenes are shown in the trailer to draw the audience,so better watch trailer than wasting cash to watch the movie.The movie offers no more thrill than the trailer.IF you are a big fan of the PREDATORS then you'll be surely disappointed seeing the powerless dumb super predators and the lifeless movie.Nothing more could be expected from a low budget movie with under utilized resources.",Predators
550,TheDude5000,Epic sequel,10,9 July 2010,"""Predators"" is a worthy follow-up to the 1987 Schwarzenneger original. In fact, this could be the best movie in the Alien/Predator series since then.""Predators"" returns the action to the jungle, only we're not on Earth anymore. A group of proved soldiers, all from different nationalities and backgrounds, find themselves dropped onto this alien planet, the Predator homeworld. Together, they have to fight their way out.The characters are all likable, especially the heroic Russian agent Nikolai and the crazy-yet-funny convict, Stans. Adrien Brody is also convincing as a seasoned soldier, and he certainly worked out enough to dismiss anyone who said he wasn't physically right for the role.Other stand-outs are the compassionate but deadly Isabelle and the panicky doctor, Edwin, as well as the silently lethal Yakuza member, Hanzo, who faces a Predator one-on-one. Laurence Fishburne may be the most impressive in his role as Nolan, an eccentric scavenger who's survived on the planet for ""10 seasons"".Another strong point is that most of the music in the movie was based on the score from the first Predator, which was one of the reasons that movie was so memorable.This is a sequel that Predator fans should go crazy for. It's got the badass action and characters, memorable lines, epic action sequences, TWO bloody final battles. It's the type of R-Rated action movie that hasn't been seen much lately, and if you're a Predator fan, you owe it to yourself to watch this.",Predators
551,brandonmouser,Predators: insulting our intelligence since 2010,5,23 July 2011,"As someone who loves the Predator films, I expected much more out of this one, especially since it involved a great actor like Adrien Brody (not to mention Fishburne, who also rocks). While the overall concept was OK, this film generally lacked the intelligence of the first two Predator films, and all too often Antal resorted to CGI-candy, lame hack and slash action, and cliché scenarios. The story ended up seeming piecemeal and the character development was weak. This might appeal to younger fans (many of whom probably didn't make it through the movie without sending a few text messages) but I wouldn't recommend it if you're a fan of the earlier films, or if you have a higher IQ. ""Noland"" (Fishburne) was probably the most disappointing character for me, not because of bad acting, but because of poor writing/directing. In summary, I would say that this film is more akin to the AvP movies: fun to watch, but lacking the virtue of the originals. Let's hope they come out with a Predator III and tuck this one into a boxed set for giggles.",Predators

553,Valdiz,Strictly for fans of the franchise,6,27 November 2010,"There are various types of viewers. For this movie I would split them in three groups: fans of the franchise, hardcore action lovers and general public. This movie is absolutely a peak for the first group and a productive popcorn crunching coke sipping eve for the second but absolutely not for the general public. I'll try to shortly break down why not:1) It is the all classical storyline about raw action, Arnold type heroism, and resemblance of the first movie in the series 2) This seems as an unsuccessful attempt of recreating the first movie 3) Adrien Brody's humble pianist now takes off his suit and grabs a gun running around the jungle shooting space monsters in a jungle setting. As much as you wish he will never be the Awesome Arny with his coldblooded look and stealth army guy looks and behavior not even comparing the classy police guy Danny Glover 4) If you have seen the first Predator then stay with the emotions you got from the movie. For a change you might sit through the second part but do not spoil everything with this movie 5) Predictability factor in this picture is way too high. You may get bored from watching it as you simply can foresee most of the actions the characters will perform in upcoming scenes 6) Yes, we watch action movies because of the shootings, fights, different tricks etc. but then they at least should be eye pleasing and enjoyable not disgusting and dull as some Jason vs. Mason immorality 7) Movies that are made into series almost surely do not bring long term success nor they raise interest for new viewers (strictly from my opinion) and Saw, Terminator (as much as I admire Arny and his T2 role) and others alike have proved it",Predators

555,baz111,Go see the original,2,8 July 2010,"Like the film I'm just gonna jump right into the thick of it. Basicially there are a group of murders or killers who are all taken onto an alien planet and are there to be hunted by the... PREDATORS! And that is basically all summed up in the first 5 minutes. No back story no build up no secret missions they all just fall to the ground and decide to find out where they are. What lays ahead is about an an hour and a halves worth of bad acting, no scares, about a million references to Predator 1 and in general one bad film.See what makes this a bad sequel is that it isn't exactly a sequel. What it is is a kind of remake but the only main difference is everybody is on a different planet and they don't know each other. The film makers don't really give any of the characters a back story, the girl with the sniper rifle has nothing said really about her past other than she works for an army, the tough guy character is basically the same as Arnold's character Dutch who is a mercenary or something and a bunch of others who really play no part in the plot and have only one thing in common that they are all killers.

Great acting in general, chizzy with deeper sense dialogues ( which is exactly that makes them great), very little clichés, tasteful innovations compared to original, standard CGI ( devoted to the story, not vice versa ), sometimes stunning but also intelligent action scenes and great ending.

However about 35min into the movie I was laughing out loud in my seat. Adrian Brody as a tough guy action hero? Um, No. Every time Brody spoke it was cheesy and completely unbelievable. The idea/plot started out OK but quickly began falling apart and getting very predictable very fast. The lack of Predators in this movie was very disappointing. The acting was ridiculous! The dialog lacked everything the first movie had. Whoever cast these actors for these characters should quit the movie biz now. Whoever wrote this garbage of a script/story line should follow. I would have rather paid for a ticket to see the original any day over this rubbish. I hope to god someone puts a bullet in this horse before it tries to ride again and do a sequel.",Predators

From the trademark sound effect when a Predator switches vision to the tension of being stalked.Both and more are used to good effect in this latest instalment. I am a huge fan of anything to do with this storyline/universe, so I may slightly biased in what I say.Acting was decent, effects were good. I was looking fairly closely at the 'dogs' and they were pretty neatly done.Storyline was perhaps a little predictable, but then there was enough for this type of movie. Only thing for me that could have been better would be the main characters weapon. It looked to me like an AA12, but it didn't contribute very well to the image of the character.

The OTT acting did not compensate for his physical on screen presence. Brody is more believable in an Ivory Merchant production.

561,BurlyBax,Weak and Aggravating,3,15 July 2011,"This movie takes one of the most famous, and most original, though underrated, movie monsters of all time, and turns it into a dim-witted beast with a head the size of a Volkswagen. The original Predator movie was a masterpiece of action and Sci-Fi horror. A feast of originality, a creature that was not only menacing in appearance and strength, but cunning. The Predator lore, tells us about a warrior culture far more advanced than ours, that remained tribal and brutal by choice. The acting in Predator (1987) was in perfect harmony with the mission of the film, to be believable. In 2010's Predators, there seems to be no goal. At every turn, plot points are spoken clearly as if you do not posses the intelligence to figure them out for yourself. The actors have no chemistry, and most appear to be using the film to showcase their personalities for future roles. Fishburne's character was especially useless, and required an act of kindness from the Predators to keep the movie from ending due to his actions. But the worst of all, would have to be the scene where they learn what the Predators are, and how they can be defeated, only to deploy none of those tactics and sit and wait behind some sticks. I cannot communicate clearly enough that if you are a fan of the Predator franchise (let alone the original, which lends several lines, plot points, scenes, and the same score) you just might want to grab those responsible for this movie by their fat heads and smack 'em around a bit. This movie is a champion of the movement in Hollywood to take creative property and revisit it for a quick buck. It made me so mad, I had to come write my first review on IMDb after being a regular for about 7 years... please forgive my rambling.",Predators
562,cilersrealm,"Not quite the original, but still good.",7,24 July 2010,"In a season of remakes, re-imagining's and sequels, Predators certainly lives up to what's expected of it. It's a re-imagining of the classic 80's action movie which had Arnie take the reigns as the leader of a super band of commando's being hunted by an extra terrestrial in the middle of the (jungle), and ended up spawning quite a franchise, consisting of a sequel, and 2 movie mash ups, the Alien vs. Predator films. Fans of the original and followers of the franchise can be forgiven for being weary of this remake (after all, I was), but believe me, Predators is the best in the series since the original.Predators, as the name suggests, features more than 1, which alone makes you wonder how true to the original this will be. Well, the movie approaches this question in a strange way. First, it takes the original premise of a band of elite warriors being hunted by an unstoppable alien menace, and gives quite a unique and refreshing twist, delivering another band of elite warriors, but this time being hunted by 3 Predators, and on THEIR planet, rather than Earth. Then on top of this, Predators takes much of what made the original great; the cheesy dialogue, the big guns, the crude humour, and even some of the same great moments, and adds them in to give Predators its own unique style, while still paying a worthy homage to the classic. There are some direct references to please the original fans, but it's not spoiled by filling it with references that only the die-hard fans would understand like many other movies are. Most of the action scene's deliver and the fire fights are well done. The scenery of the planet is beautiful (though it's actually only Hawaii), and the movie generally has a good pace, despite some times where this falters. And I have to award bonus points for the movie's opening: it was a unique way of introducing us to the situation, and without giving too much away, it sucks you in, even if it is a little far-fetched. But don't get too excited, the movie definitely has its problems. Some of the dialogue, especially of one character is just bad, and I'm still not sure whether or not it tried to do it purposely and just failed, or if the writers just scribbled down anything they could think of at the last minute. Then there's also some back-story and deeper meaning to the entire Predator universe and their scenario, which is nice, but at times it really drags on and takes the rest of the movie down with it. There's also one specific scene, which includes a homage to the original, but is ridiculous, and apart from the reference, it's almost laughable. One of the biggest things that got me though, and it may not annoy others, is the amount of Predator screeches and screams. It seemed as though every 5 minutes, another Predator was screaming for some unknown reason. Maybe he didn't hit what he was aiming for, maybe he trod on a sharp rock, or maybe his Predator wife left him and he's not taking too well, but any way I don't care what's happened, so please stop screaming at me! The casting is strange to say the least. Adrien Brody, trying to channel the essence of Schwarzenegger, and who would have been my last pick as an action hero, pulls off the role surprising well. Most of the actors perform satisfyingly, and the brief appearances by Laurence Fishburne and Danny Trejo are a nice touch. My only queries with the casting are that of Topher Grace. He spends the entire movie seeming out of place, not quite fitting in to the situation, and at no point is he even slightly convincing as the character he is meant to portray. Predators was released with some big shoes that it knew it had to fill, and so instead of trying to outdo the original or be new and fresh, it uses what made the original great to its advantage. I must say kudos to Nimrod Antal for directing, and kudos to the make-up department, because they definitely outdid themselves with this project. Predators is a refreshing shot in the arm to a nearly dead franchise, and stands out in the ocean of movie remakes and sequels that Hollywood is churning out. For what it's designed to be, an action blockbuster popcorn flick, it definitely delivers.",Predators

It been 11 years since when i first saw predator on TV and it blow my mind, but since than, every movie that features predators sucks.....leaving me with a damaged experience ... I was hyped out of my mind to know a new predator movie was coming out, and since Robert Rodriguez was involved, i was fairly confident this movie will be a fun ride. before the movie, my hype went overdrive, I kept saying ""ANY TIME"" to my mom that she got really annoyed..lol when i saw the movie today, my experience was further FUBR...for almost half of the film i was on the edge of my seat and thinking ""it's coming! its just around the corner"" but it took almost 30 mins till a cloaked predator showed up......i know they were trying to mimic the first film where the predator only shows at the end..but we alllllll knew about the predators in this film existence when we bought the tickets, so cut the suspense and give us the predators! also, the scenes with predators in this movie(around 5 scenes where they were uncloaked) are very limited and they are significantly weaker than all other predators in the ""franchise"", they die almost as fast as those demons in Ghost rider...oh....the ""the enemy's enemy is my friend"" theory is still in this movie ...when will they ever learn.....Also, every character in the film knew they did bad things(killings) before they arrived, Topher Grace's character just sticks out like a sore thumb.....his speech at the end was exactly the same as the one in spider man 3 ...The only plus about this movie is Adrien Brody, i never liked him before, but in this movie this IS the tough guy, very convincing.

I like the Pred concept and action Sci-fi in general....so what happened? It was basically a unintelligent survival movie with no story and a silly twist with the doctor at the end. Very little money was spent on special effects. We got more of the same ""cloaking"", ""plasma bolts"", do nothing space ship, ho hum. Instead of the director having the actors acquire alien weapons/tech I guess he felt it would be better to give unlimited bullets to the actors? The Predators were dull and not interesting to say the least. The CGI dogs were tougher then the predators? I kept wondering why the director felt a story was unimportant. Couldn't he have the predators talking at some point explaining what the blood feud was about or something else interesting? Are we ever going to see them talk or is that to hard because the Predator mystique is over? We waited years for this quick cash grab flick? One new Pred gizmo for the whole movie: a robot bat they use to cheat the hunt...yay! By the way, what is sporting about being invisible and seeing in infra red?

565,moderor,"Committee tries to write a good Predator script, moves in the right direction but falls down halfway.",4,8 August 2010,"OK, here's what I saw. I saw a genre with tremendous potential that somehow is not churning out money. I saw a decision made - ""AVP was a bad idea. Let's make Predator again and see if that works."" The trouble is, it's been remade with the same elements - but not the same spirit. It looks a like like the first, so much that it comes across as a clone. No, not even that - a xerox. It's a very obviously committee-written story, that took one or two good ideas and tried to run with it, overloaded it, and fell flat. The first one was... clean. Don't humanize Predators, guys - keep them the way they're meant to be, and play around with the rest. You'll have a winner. This... is a travesty. On the plus side, the first half is pretty decent. I liked getting different groups of people from different places, except they should've added some more variety - right now, the doc was so obviously out of place you knew what he was in the first few seconds. Adding the con wasn't enough camouflage. Good action, fast, and the idea of having Adrien Brody's character be completely coldblooded and calculating, ready to use the rest as bait to get his own ends achieved was sheer genius. All to often we've had to swallow the fact that every movie character (especially if he's the one going to survive till the end) is essentially a Good Guy. Would it have worked better if he'd escaped, and the others fought and survived as a separate story arc? Dunno - something to think about in sequels. Laurence Fishburne was so, so, SO wasted. A long-term survivor, who's been driven insane by the situation, deserves an entire series to himself. So, of course, you kill him off in the most obviously and ridiculously simple way possible. Come on, use your characters better, people! You should have saved at least three more people easily for the next one - and it would've been awesome. But you wasted the build-up. Now, we have the classic Adam & Eve walking off into the sunset ending. predictable and bo-ring. Synopsis: An OK watch, decent entertainment, but not a patch on the original. But still better than AVP.",Predators
566,Colonel_W_E_Kurtz,The real predator movie we all have been waiting for since '87.,10,7 July 2010,"First of all, it's not a reboot as many speculates, it's direct continuation to Predator 1&2, and only AVPs are dismissed but the movie doesn't neglect them altogether, we get to see alien like skulls in the movie, however alien universe is wholly neglected.Let's start with the best part of the movie, the acting. It's very rare for a sci-fi movie to contain good acting these days, all gone are the days of Alien/Aliens/Blade runner etc. where the acting used to get all the praise more than action. In Predators, every single character is very believable and delivers. It's astonishing to see the acting of Brody, he deserves an Oscar for his role as Royce more than he did in ""The Pianist"" as Szpilman. Rest of the cast did very well too, they perfectly fill in their boots as group of elite warriors. It would be fair to say that compared to the original Predator movie, this movie exceeds in the acting department.Next comes the story line, it's pretty much based on ""The Most Dangerous Game"", the story itself is well written and not rushed, it takes time to unfold events, and ample time is given to develop characters. There is really a fear and eerie feeling in the story, and we don't get to see the hunters very often, which adds more thrill and suspense to the story; just like the original flick. To me an unseen threat is more scarier than seeing the perpetrator every minute.The music is tense, almost reminiscent of Alan Silversti score in the original. Good thing here is that it's not overdone, and the drum beats are used rightfully when the situation demands it to. Really nice work by the composer.As for CGI, it's very minimal and not overdone as well, although not same as the original which is understandable since a lot of progress have been made in graphics department since 80's, take Avatar for example.I also want to talk little bit about violence and rating of the movie, it's also not very frequent we get to see spine ripped off and people chopped into half by laser guns these days, had crafty cuts to the movie not been made, this flick could very well been awarded an NC-17 rating.Last but not the least, this flick is an instance of how a good movie can be made on a small budget, you don't require big budget for your movie to please audiences, you just need to have a vision thing to make pleasurable flicks for them. Kudos goes to Nimród Antal & Robert Rodriguez for such a great effort.Final score:-Direction: 10/10 Acting: 10/10 Music: 10/10 Story line: 8/10",Predators
567,bytesfree,A tribute to the original which should have gone straight to DVD,3,11 July 2010,"The first Predator movie was great, a classic which suited Arnies wooden acting perfectly. The second was not so, but acted as a good teaser for the AVP franchise and gave a little insight into the Predators culture.Then we have Predators. I knew before heading out the door with my wad of cash for cinema prices that I was going to regret it and happily in that respect I got exactly what I paid for.Throw a group of people together in a Cube like scenario, give them a gun of seemingly unlimited ammo (and a super-light Mini-gun) and you have Predators. The discourse between the male/female lead at the beginning immediately told you that the end of the movie would see the two walking off into the sunset(s) and the only unexpected twist was when the hapless ""prey"" discovered they were on another planet. That to me came as a surprise since whilst walking through the jungle to that point they had come across no alien wildlife/fauna to make them realise that. So an almost identical earth like jungle on a planet in a unique star system? OK.Of course the big question was why did the Predators need to take people away to another world, when the Earth has plenty of unexplored jungle and since they were already there made the whole scenario seem a little silly.So Predators for me was a tribute of sorts to the original, with the original score popping up occasionally to try to remind you of better cinematic times. The rag-tag collection of people were about as interesting as that which you would find in an episode of Big Brother and the tribute to Arnie at the end (with the mud) was more of a cheapening of the original suspense created when you saw that the Predator could not detect him.All in all another cash in of a franchise, of course this will sell, it sold to me and I had already predicted the movie before I got to see it....If it had been a TV movie or straight to DVD I might have been a little more forgiving.",Predators
568,trackallstar,"Not bad, but a bit of a dragged piece",7,9 July 2010,"I just got back from seeing Predators at my theater. I'll be honest, I saw all of the positive reviews on here and rotten tomatoes and walked in with pretty high expectations. The beginning of the movie was fast paced, with all of the characters meeting each other and first encountering the Predators. However, after the scene with Laurence Fishburne all the way up to the final sequence, I felt that the movie dragged on and got a little predictable. In fact, I thought that Fishburne's character was completely unnecessary, since his character didn't play a vital role in this movie at all. I did, however, enjoy the little twist towards the end of the movie with one of the characters.Overall, it was a pretty enjoyable flick that did the original good. If you're a fan for gore, The Most Dangerous Game, or the Predators, then definitely check this out.",Predators
569,ejskaterboy,The sequel we've been asking for... no waiting for,8,10 July 2010,"Wow... that is the only word I have to explain how I feel about this movie... well not really, but it was a great movie. Basically this movie is about a group of random human ""predators"" kidnapped and thrown into the predator's endless game preserve(which happens to be an overgrown jungle). Now having no idea where they are or why their there they come to ban together and figure a way out of this jungle. Soon they realize that it's not any other regular jungle and it's another planet as well them being hunted. For the rest of the movie they try figuring out ways to get off the planet.Alright now to begin this review I must say that THIS MOVIE ROCKED!!!! This movie was great... pretty much everything about it was great. The effects, the acting, the story, the action... pretty much all of it; however I did have this weird empty feeling that there should have been more gore, and I think in some ways deep down they probably wanted more gore but I'm fine with what I've been handed. As for Adrien Brody as the leading man, I thought he did phenomenal! He played a good Arnie follow up and a good character of his own nature. Even the co stars were great in this movie. Now the effects where awesome! They didn't go overboard with the CG but it still seemed to work for them. The story is original and unique, and it feels that empty feeling you have(or at least i had) when you wonder what could happen with each situation. Not very many movies can do that.Now with having said this was a great awesome movie, and it was, but I do want to say its not as good as the original. Almost... but not quite. The original is a classic that could and will never be beat by any sequel... I'm sorry to say that but I know it's the truth and so do you.Now all in all I give this movie an 8.5 out of 10 or an A- on the letter scale. This film was fun, creepy, funny... well the whole package. I highly recommend this film to ANYONE... who enjoys a great sequel to the Predator film base. Much better than AVP: Requiem.",Predators
570,emsaliya,What a Waste,1,9 July 2010,I've been waiting so anxiously to watch this film since I liked the original releases of Predator movies. This film is no way near any of that. There are quite a number of unrealistic things in the movie.1. Why did Laurence Fishburne acted like a crazy man and gave up the position and let Predators killed him without a fight? 2. What happened to the Doc (Topher Grace) at the end? I am not sure if I could call that a twist. I would rather say that's cheap story writing.3. Why did the Chinese man started fighting with just a bare sword? Pretty pathetic. What is more stupid is that he is able to kill the predator with just a plain old sword while the main actor (Adrien Brody) struggled so hard to kill the last one with a better axe kind of thing.Insanely the story ended just like a cheap love story. All in all this is one great waste of money and time.,Predators
571,TheDancingPopcorn,Absolutely Terrible & Completely Misleading,2,18 July 2010,"The tagline for this movie is good - a real attention getter: FEAR IS REBORN. And, yes, folks, fear has been reborn. What the directors & producers fail to tell you is that, while fear has been reborn, it's mother must have given birth to it in in another movie, in a different theater, apparently way... way across town. I had three reasons to want to see this movie: No 1. Walton Goggins. I have been a tremendous fan of Walton Goggins ever since Season 1, Episode 1 of ""The Shield"" premiered on FX back in 2002. I loved him in ""The Shield,"" I loved him in Rob Zombie's ""House of 1000 Corpses,"" I think he is just a great dramatic-cum- comedic actor and I love to watch him work. No 2. To see the predator again. Just about six months ago I revisited the original on it's two disk special edition DVD and, while a lot of the technology in the movie is IN.CRED.IB.LY dated, it's still a pretty kick-ass science fiction/action movie and that monster is friggen iconic. And No 3. Because of that one scene in the trailer - the scene that grabbed me, that made me say ""Don't wait to rent it. Don't wait for Redbox. See it in the theater and see it right away."" A jaw-dropping scene where Adrien Brody steps into the jungle and has one of the predator's trademark 3-prong laser scopes on him. And then a second laser appears. And then a third and finally cuts with like ten of them pointed in his direction. THIS was the draw for me. Well, guess what... Walton Goggins? Barely in the movie and doesn't talk a whole lot. So there ruins reason number one. The old-fashion predator? They show him for two minutes in the middle, four minutes at the end. Why? Because he's been replaced with a new, bigger, faster, darker, MORE lobster like predator. Fantastic, there goes reason number two. And finally... reason number three? The kick-ass scene from the preview? DOESN'T HAPPEN. Nothing even remotely CLOSE to this scene happens. The previews & trailers for ""Predators"" mislead you in every way possible and the general public deserves to know that they are lied to in an attempt to draw them into theater without any redeeming factors. I should have known it was going to be terrible just by the presence of Topher Grace. (I'm sorry - he's cute, he seems like a nice guy, but he really couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag.) So, ""Predators."" It's dialog is terrible. It's acting is ""meh."" The violence & special effects were pretty toned down. The story wasn't great. There were plot holes big enough for Schwarzenegger to walk through. They reference and then rip-off the first movie (INTENTIONALLY!). They try to make up for two terrible ""Alien vs Predator"" movies by featuring a climatic Predator vs Predator fight.... it's just really, really, really awful.",Predators
572,wolskint,"I'm very, very disappointed with this movie.",3,14 July 2010,"The beginning of the movie is interesting. However, the the further the movie goes to less interesting it becomes. First. I don't like when movie makers think that viewers are so stupid that main character in the movie must explain to the viewers what is happening (i.e. these were hunting dogs, we are being hunted, this planet is strange, ...). This off course indicates that all other characters in the movie, except the main one off course, ale also super stupid to figure those things on themselves. This also shows that writers and the director had not idea how to present this story, in such a way that no explanations are needed. Second. Characters. I just don't care about them. Why should a viewer care about brainless killers, criminals? The only person I cared for was the Russian man, since he at least had a family and looked as a decent person. Third. As far as I could understand, in the movie tries to say that there are two kinds of predators, and one of them hunts the other kind? Why? Predators are a highly advance civilizations (they have advance weapons, spaceships), so why would they kill their own people in a hunt? It would be OK, if in the movie they said e.g. ""This predator is a criminal according to a predator's law, and his punishment is being hunt down by his mates"" or something similar. To sum up, the movie was far from good",Predators
573,bIeese,"An entertaining movie, with a few flaw",1,8 July 2010,"(note: i did not see predator 1 or 2, (AvP and AvP2 i did watch) so i cannot judge for people who have seen the series) Predators starts very quickly and does not seem to stop, there is never a slow down or time to relax, you are left hanging on to your seat, throughout the whole movie. Predators starts off with a ""horror"" approach, but this horror is deeply satisfying, it is not the tradition (present) horror with a cheezy storyline, supreme gore and a lot of spook; it dwindles more along the lines of creepy horror, (not to say there is not a fair share of spooks and gore in the movie) the horror that makes you realize how close the characters were to danger, similar horror to the movie Signs, but predators are the aliens.The developers of this movie really tried hard to show realistic emotions to a unrealistic situation. I'll give you an example of a unrealistic reaction to a unrealistic situation, every seen a horror movie, and you want to shout to the actor ""DON'T GO IN THERE!"" in predators these moments are not there (well there might be one or two but not many).By the end of the movie, however, the horror aspect disappears as it becomes a traditional predator action movie, you no longer feel scared, but you do feel pumped, and ready for more action. There is also some parts of the movie where you feel that the true power of the predator is underplayed, as in, the predators seem... weaker then usual. There is also a lot of unanswered question with the storyline, maybe its intentional... maybe not. As previously mentioned, the movie has no breaks, this can be tiring and can make a viewer lose track of the series of events.In the end this movie seems like a great success, yet I cannot give it anything higher then a 7.4 (rounded to be a 7) but in my opinion any movie 7 or over is worth watching. Watch predator if your in to a high thrill, horror, action movie.",Predators
574,Billy26748,Fun Filled throw back,10,10 July 2010,"So after two goofy attempts to wedge Predator into an Alien movie (or vice versa), along comes Rodriguez, who promptly hires up & comer Nimrod Antal (Kontroll, Vacancy) to give our beloved Predator his first legitimate sequel in over twenty years. ""Back to the basics"" was probably one of the mottoes of the key creative team (which also includes screenwriters Michael Finch and Alex Litvak), which helps to explain why, against all odds, Predators turns out to be a very entertaining ""old-school"" action flick that doesn't skimp on the sci-fi, the horror, or the colorful characters we hope to expect from a simple action flick like Predators. It's essentially a very bad-ass ""point A to point B to point C"" adventure story that focuses on colorful character traits as often as it does crazy alien-induced super-carnage. It's amazing how just a little extra effort can make an action film's ""talky parts"" almost as much fun as the mayhem.All of the trademark touches that the fans love are present and accounted for and, in some cases, expanded upon: the invisible camouflage, the heat vision trick, the horribly effective weaponry, the removal of the spinal cord from a recently dispatched ""trophy,"" etc. -- so ""the basics"" are covered rather well. On top of that, the producers decided upon a decidedly minimalistic approach to their overdue sequel. In other words, there's no speech-making, no ridiculously clichéd plot contrivances, no extraneous subplots. Hell, even the slower moments are kept fun because of the colorful cast that Rodriguez has pulled together. In addition to Brody's surprisingly intense lead performance, highlights include a heavily-armed Danny Trejo, an enjoyably sleazy Walton Goggins, an unexpectedly charming Topher Grace, and the gorgeous gunsmith played by Alice Braga.In keeping with the ""no-frills, old-school"" vibe, Predators delivers practical effects all over the place. Aside from some necessary splashes of CGI here and there, the effects come from the Greg Nicotero / Howard Berger team -- and they're pretty much awesome across the board. Of course we get some gross new Predators to feast our eyes upon, but the ""classic"" character is also on board -- and all four of the Predators (in addition to their dog-like mega-beasts and a few other nasty newcomers) look like living, breathing creatures. CGI will never trump ""a guy in a suit,"" provided the suits (and the guys) are as cool as the ones found in Predators.",Predators

PREDATOR to PREDATORS, ala ALIEN to ALIENS. how do you make a monster movie even scarier? make another one with a TON of monsters! brilliant! its a great concept that sort of came up in predator 2, but that sh*it was just too silly for me. I'm not even going to talk about the AvP series, because that was just some gimmicky, childish, video-game-movie B.S.i'm also not going to do what most other reviewers do and just sum up the entire plot in four paragraphs. no, this movie is worth paying to see, and is most definitely worth the surprise.film and cinema should be an experience. there are very few films i have ever seen that you can actually FEEL the energy of everybody around you immersed in the world on screen. this film is one of them. as an example, whenever a predator died, the audience would cheer ""YEAH!"" not to mention the scene with the Yakuza in the field, having a one-on-one sword battle with a predator. when the battle ended, the entire theater was roaring with applause! that scene would have nearly got a standing ovation if only it were at the end of the film. people never actually clap in theaters any more!this is very surprising and exciting to me, because usually sci-fi and horror films are just generally very shallow and tired. i really, really, really hope another predator movie as good as this one is made in less than 20 years.there have already been some other reviews saying the movie was very serious, and humorless compared to the original. i couldn't disagree more. there were quite a few times where the audience was gut-laughing, maybe even a bit too much for my comfort. i mean, chingao! so get off the internetz, get out there, and see this movie as soon as you can!-eric",Predators

577,marcopusa29,Poor,2,11 July 2010,"As a big fan of the original I have been excited about Predators since it was announced, with the talent behind it what could possibly go wrong? ...well quite a bit actually. There is no character development. In the original you cared when Blaine had his stomach blown out and Mac mourned him, you give a sh*t when Billy went out in a blaze of glory (off screen of course). In predators the characters are thrown into the jungle and it is not long after they start to meet their makers at the hands of the predators. This means you never really care when someone bites it and was it me or were the deaths in this not as bloody. There is no tension, no sense of dread like in the original, although there is 3 predators you don't see enough of them and they are big softies when you do, they just don't seem as intimidating as the original predator. The acting sucks why people think Adrian Brody put in a good performance is beyond me. He thinks you act tough by putting on a Batman style gruff voice, I just sat there wishing Dutch would turn up and blow Brady away.The plot premise is a good one but the execution is poor. I guessed instantly the order the characters would die in from the off, it was so obvious it was untrue.Finally the worst thing of all ..Laurence Fishburne, wow possibly one of the worst pieces of acting I have seen, he stunk the cinema out. There was zero point to his character and thank god he is only in it briefly I could not have handled Laurence's sorry attempt at acting a bit mad for the whole movie.Maybe I am being harsh as I love predator so I had very high expectations going into the cinema. The only positives are the action set pieces are well filmed and Louis Ozawa Changchien is pretty cool as the nearly silent assassin Hanzo.Overall a real letdown, bring back Dutch, Dillon, Mac and the rest of the original crew.",Predators

Please, I beg of you, if like me you have love and appreciation of the original movie then DO NOT go to see this abomination. I lost count of the blatant raping of the 1st movie, from the jungle drum beat, to the macho one-on-one sword fight of a bloke without a shirt, to the inclusion of a Elpidia Carrillo (Anna) look-a-like in the form of Alice Braga, right down to the song choice of the closing credits. If Arnold had been in it you'd think you were back in 1987. But surely I'm exaggerating. It not as though there were waterfalls to aid escape or fire to blind the Predators. Oh, hold on a minute, yes there was. I swear if they had covered themselves in mud I would have thrown my hot dog at the screen. Rarely have I seen a remake that made no effort to disguise the fact it was cashing in on the success of an ever popular past classic.As for the casting, well it's clear they had an eye on straight-to-DVD when they made this POS as they had insufficient confidence to pick a worthwhile actor to carry the movie. I'm still waiting to see a movie with Danny Trejo in it where he isn't blindly shooting two oozy 9mm guns. Adrien Brody looked more like a safari tour guide than an action hero. I thought Laurence Fishburne may have been the saving grace for the cast but even his character wasn't enough to breathe life into this waste of a projector.If you thought Alien vs Predator 2 was as low as Hollywood could get to milk the dollars from the Predator-admiring fan base then you are deeply mistaken.

581,samsavenger,Craptacular,1,15 July 2010,"I accept that it's not necessary or expected for a predator film to have a believable premise or even a stimulating plot... but this was a pretty serious kick in the nads for any audience with half a brain.I'm a huge fan of the original predator movie. A testament to 1980's excess and an ultimate expression of freedom in the media surrounding violence at the time - it was completely natural in it's blatant worship of uber masculinity, unprecedented ratio of explosions to conversation and cheesy one-liners. It stared you in the face with tongue in cheek and grabbed you by the balls, forced you to swallow it's unintelligible cheese, kicked your ass and sent you on your way. It was proud. Irrespective of the superficial similarities of these two movies, please do not make the mistake of comparing them. They are actually nothing alike at heart.Half-assed attempts at 'clever plot twists' and blatant flaws in both character and plot logic disrupted the flow on this movie to the point where it was almost unwatchable. The few redeeming qualities which basically involved people kicking the crap out of aliens and vice versa, were obviously CGI and/or cheap rubber sets on a low budget sound stage. Special effects occasionally bordered on laughable, but mostly just plain cheap and distasteful. The fluorescent blood was a nice touch, but being led to believe it involved anything other than the special effects crew emptying out glow sticks on to a cheap costume is insulting.It occurred to me about two thirds of the way through that this film is nothing more than a progression of ridiculous scenarios, (most derived from countless other near-identical crappy Hollywood movies) during which the characters were expected to leap to wild and sometimes bizarrely misguided conclusions, only to be proved wrong in another surprising string of events which this time around involve shooting, invisible aliens and/or CGI explosions. I felt as though the film was constantly flaunting it's pseudo-intellect by means of constantly pretending to be a step ahead of its audience, but not really making a serious effort or taking any genuinely unexpected turns in the plot. The one 'twist' that did almost inspire me with a dull sense of surprise was the the weak city slicking doctor who appeared at first to be nothing other than comic relief turned out to be a crazed rapist, but this was really not essential to the plot in any way and did not seem to intertwine into the rest of the story. To add to the confusion, he was muttering about being on the same side as the predators before being killed by Brody - with which I celebrated with a yawn of jaded disbelief.Despite the ounce of effort, character development was shallow at best and did not seem natural for the actors. Casting was bizarre - Adrian Brody's along with comments made throughout the movie (""are you IDF?""), this struck me as more of a thinly disguised pro-Israeli political statement rather than a genuine consideration of appropriateness for the film.All in all, this is another crappy, uninteresting, generic Hollywood action movie. If that's not bad enough by itself - it was also riddled with gaping plot holes, a jarring cadence, a hammy script, bad special effects and painfully inappropriate casting. To add insult to injury, it has defiled an all time classic action movie and condescended the audience in a manner which makes me scratch my head as to why more people don't absolutely hate it.",Predators

Im gonna just go threw the whole movie and say what i liked and disliked.The movie began pretty good. I liked how it was all 'BAM! free-fall straight into the a big-ass jungle.' Although an introduction before-hand might have been OK, i rather wouldv'e just skipped some lengthy and boring intro and went straight to the action.I had mixed feelings when i realized Adrien Brody was the main character. I didn't think he would fill Arnie's shoes too well, but he looked ripped enough to make some sort of impact. Turns out he did a good job.Here comes the part i hated the most. its not too bad, but it was still kinda stupid: the other, filler characters. i got a little edgy when the German dude was firing at them. i was all ""...wtf. your stupid to kill others who seem to have been falling just like you."" i hated how Fishburne wasn't given a bigger part. as a matter of fact, everyone that died should have been given a bigger part. thats not too big, but i still think it shouldve been put in. the movie was filmed in 53 days. c'mon, make an awesome movie at least 2 hours and put some extra ""umph"" in it.The other alien species'. I'm gonna make this one very brief. they shouldv'e showed up more than just one scene. done.My opinion over the predators changed over the period of the movie. First was ""these guys are flipping awesome. just like the first ones"" and then ""why the heck are these super awesome new predators not owning."" and finally ""wtf, they got their heads cut off like they were apples."" don't get me wrong, they did awesomely, its just they could've been more awesome by, like, using more weapons or something like that.another brief one. if Fishburne wasn't gonna last very long, then his presence wasn't needed at all. and even then, they shouldv'e USED THE WEAPONS AND ARMOR HE HAD.OK last part. the ending was pretty good. i like the whole epicness and originality of using fire as a camouflage. (speaking of which, they shouldve been rolling around like crazy in mud when they found out that that could camouflage them).The movie was pretty good. if i could rate in halves, i would give it 6 and a half, but since i cant, ill just give it a 7.",Predators
584,rorschachsjournal-aitken,Passable - Anytime,7,18 July 2010,"Let me say that I enjoyed large parts of this movie without loving it. Predators is a decent sequel to the original and as many posters point out, there are too many directly lifted concepts from the original movie: sword fight stand off, 7 guys and a girl in the jungle, another guy with Old Painless etc but it does work. You get the game reserve on an alien world, armed prisoners and ex-servicemen and women fighting to stay alive and the typical climax at the end so it delivers what you might expect in terms of events.The biggest problem with any sequel to Predator is the creature's modus operandi has been established and it can not be as tense or scary again. Predator 2 was a good movie despite the detractors who probably wanted a Schwarzenegger return on a par with Ripley from Alien to Aliens but once we know:A. What the creature really looks like B. What it does c. The Infra-red stuffThe concept is not as effective in the same way that the face- hugger/chest burst Alien idea loses its effectiveness the more times you see it.The other problem with this movie is the characters. The acting is decent enough but it is not as memorable as the Arnie, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke stuff. It lacks style. Adrien Brody is wrong for this movie - he simply cannot carry an action role and no one will believe he is bad ass enough no matter how many guns he has or how many push ups he has done to get buff. Danny Trejo is good as are the lesser cast members but you don't care enough about them - all their back stories aren't explained that well but this is a minor complaint because basically they are all meant to be prey. Then we get the incredibly annoying Topher Grace. I'm sorry son but you are just Eric Forman in EVERYTHING you appear in. You ruined Spiderman 3 (although not single handedly) and you clearly have a good agent who gets you roles in movies you do not belong in. At least most of the cast of That 70's show had the good grace to go another way. SPOILER - When he turns nasty towards the end I just cringed. He can't be tough or even remotely evil, just weedy and annoying.The movie does add some new things to the series - the 2 types of Predator like clans, the dogs they send to flush them out as well as honoring the ideas in the original - hunting in jungles, the trophies (spinal column and skull) but it feels a little contrived over all.There are no classic one liners ad infinitum as in the original, there are fewer great set pieces and the final battle while decent is never going to be a patch on the ""Do it NOW. Kill me"" bit. There is less humor and the tension of the original is not there but you know what? It can't be. It is a sequel.Treat this as a no brainer movie and you will enjoy it. Go in with demands and you'll feel let down.I personally am somewhere in between.",Predators
585,madheadmcgough,Never As Good As The Original,5,21 July 2010,"First of all we actually did not want to see this film in the first place instead we wanted to watch inception which would of been a better choice unfortunately both Toy Story 3 and Inception was sold out.This then lead to us buying tickets for Predators which i wish we did not.There are many flaws in this film which i see first of all no offence but they should never have put a lady in the film in the first place, she didn't really do what they intended her to do which is romantically fall in love for the main character. I also would of liked to see more of Laurence Fishburne instead of him being in the film for about 10-15mins this was a really waste of time for him as he is a really good actor.Another flaw in the film was when the Chinese guy pulled out the samurai sword i felt at this point it was really stupid.Another stupid part in the film was the part when the girl says that ""the only way the spec ops solider survived was by mud"" this is referring to the first predator which made me smile.But the thing that annoyed me was that none of them covered themselves in mud after hearing this.As well as having stupid moments they really do fail at comedy by trying to make jokes just before there about to die.Please do not attempt to remake predator unless you have a better cast and a new director.",Predators
586,welshmof,Not a bad effort but still can't beat the original,6,22 July 2010,"I went to watch this film last night and I got to say I was left feeling that this was another missed opportunity to reboot the series.After the dredge we seen from the two AVP films (okay, AVP requiem was much better) I thought Rodriquez would have finally sat down with FOX and said okay whats good about the 1987 film and how can we improve on it? Sadly there's only a few moments in the film that they actually came up with something original. I.e. Dropping onto an alien plant etc, adding a different race of predator.The rest of film is a carbon copy virtually of the first, a generic pick one off at a time slasher flick and very corny in places. Especially in some of the lines being spoken.For me, what made the original so good was the suspense and terror that built up in film. It was a serious film. However With this you know what to expect and the film just doesn't give you that feeling.I praise for the effort but sorry Arnie and his gang still cant be beaten!",Predators
587,smt-nasser,The worst movie I have watched this year....avoid at all cost,1,5 August 2010,"This movie is genuinely one of the worst that I have ever seen. In my whole life. So much so that I have actually created an account on IMDb just to review it and warn other fans of the original movie just how terrible it is.Firstly, the cast is an absolute joke. The casting directors evidently felt that replacing universally loved 80's action heros who had the physical on-screen presence to be believable warriors, with a bunch of skinny B-listers was adequate. Maybe they didn't have enough money or maybe this whole film was a rush job but it just doesn't work. I feel that Adrien Brody didn't really manage to carry the film either, which doesn't surprise me since he would have had to carry quite a weight.Secondly, the film's plot is awful. I wont go into it but suffice it to say that the Predators are seen far too often, are far too stupid, are not physically imposing enough and are not anywhere near as terrifying as in the original movie, leaving the audience with a 'so-what?' attitude to them. This undermines the whole mechanic of the film. The characters are not only uni-dimensional but are killed off far too quickly for anyone to really care about their deaths. Some of the lines that they come out with are, frankly, comical and in the situation that they find themselves. To compound all of this, a fat Laurence Fishburne turns up and his character is so unbelievably predictable, down to small nuances, its not even funny. The script driving this plot is weak at best and the icing on this turd cake that wasted two hours of my life is when Adrien Brody steals Arnie's classic line 'Kill Me! Come on Kill me!!'. Frankly, this is a terrible film. If you consider the original film a classic, don't go to see this. Even if you've never seen the original, don't waste your time with this.",Predators
588,spaceplant,bad,3,28 March 2011,"in order to have a good movie, the movie-watcher absolutely needs to be interested in what happens in it; they need to be drawn in, from beginning to end. Character development is one way to accomplish this. Perhaps someone in the audience grows to like a certain character as the movie progresses. This is because this character has been well-developed and the character is understood by the watcher. There is almost none of this in Predators.The plot suffers a lot from this lack of characterization. In the case of Predators, the plot is that humans, who represent earth's modern warriors, have been sent to an alien planet where they are to be pursued by aliens in a test of skill, and they must survive. Anything else? Not really. Can it be executed well? Yes, any idea can. IS this idea executed well? No. Without sufficient character development, who cares if these characters are being hunted?There is not much for the movie to stand on with characters and story in the garbage. The movie has some spots of humor here and there, and action sequences. One would expect the movie to make up for these weaknesses by focusing on the visual element. However, even the action sequences are mediocre, and the special effects are nothing new; the poorly rendered bloody mist after Noland is vaporized is particularly cheesy. Suspense would have been perfect for this kind of movie, but how can this exist when putting these characters in danger is not a particularly pressing matter because they are so flat? The acting is not amazing. The most lively character of the cast is Noland, played by Fishburne, and he gets very little screen time.The movie sacrifices immersion for mindless action that isn't even good, and ends up being a bore of a thriller.",Predators

I could re-enact the whole thing right in front of you. I've seen it so many times, I even watched it once in Spanish with French sub-titles. And with the way Hollywood seems to rape all the things I hold dear (i.e. transformers, AVP, G.I Joe, etc.) I was really hoping I wouldn't leave the theater crying or punching the wall. This is the first time in a while I've actually gone to the theater more than once to see the same movie and it has, for me, stood up to multiple viewings. Sure there's holes in the plot (how can everybody know English?) but I don't think it deserves some of the trashing it gets here. I guess I like how there really are no ""good guys"" in this movie since everybody in it is a ruthless killer. I did find that the new 'super' predators were a little unnecessary-- sort of the angry africanized bees of the predators-- but I can live with it. I really can't believe the Expendables gets a better rating than this, now THAT'S an abomination!!",Predators

Some poor guy must have been left to cut-and-paste a manuscript together the weekend before they started filming.As a sci-fi fan I feel sorrow when the genre is treated in this way.

591,bjmarsha,Disappointed,3,30 January 2011,"I had heard good things, but overall, this movie was a disappointment. I agree with most other reviews that it's painfully obvious who is going to live/die. Hollywood seems to think Americans only love other Americans...unless the foreigner is a hot chick, so it's a dead giveaway who is gonna be left at the end.Anyways, some pros (IMO) were the use of new hunting tactics (dogs, bait, etc), a prisoner of their own kind (although the ""tribal warfare"" theory was rather stupid in my opinion), some of the scenery was nifty, and there were at least attempts at good acting here and there.Unfortunately, the cons overwhelm the pros. Acting overall was bad. The plot was predictable, and the only twists the movie takes don't have any significance (the neurotoxin guy actually being evil?...plus how did he know what that plant was? He's on a foreign planet!) Furthermore, parts of the movie were just ignorant to the plot. The dead guy who made his ""last stand?"" That many traps would take weeks, if not months to set up. You telling me the predators just chilled out during that time? Also, what's with the other reptilian creatures? One was still alive and chased one of the characters, but they never made a significant appearance in the movie again. It certainly wasn't for plot development, because Fishburne's character could have been completely left out. Also, anyone curious as to how the predator's ship took off when Brody's character wasn't even on it to fly it up? Next, the CGI was brutal. The dogs, the blood in the sword battle, and many other things looked so fake it was pitiful. And finally, I was annoyed that many of the characters might as well have been from the first movie. The chaingunner? The random black guy you KNOW is gonna die early on? The swordsman, who conveniently makes his last stand like the original? Oh yeah, and don't even get me started on stealing lines from the original movie.Really, this movie had a ton of potential. Bad/stolen characters, irrelevant plot turns, and bad acting and CGI pretty much ruin this one. Worth a red box rental, but I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in theaters.

Sorry to say i agree that this movie was not a good film The setting- Nothing spectacular about it. Big jungle and only a few nice landscapes. The predator world could have been done much better. I was looking forward to some serious scenery yet i thought the world was pretty lame.The Action- sporadic and uneventful, lasting maybe at most 2 and a half minutes. Nothing seemed to make me enjoy the predators. Not enough blades shown, only a few laser shots, and some predator vs predator(sucked not cool, should not have shown predators fighting sorry). I walked out not even remembering an actual awesome action sequence.Acting/Script- horrible! I didn't feel any emotion for any characters. No one was cool or interesting. I seemed to just be happy when i saw a predator. You cannot take away their coolness. The preds did look better then ever though. The dialogue actually made me cringe and feel embarrassed for the actors.The directing was was OK, i have no complaints for antal at the momment.Im not trying to bash the movie because it was just OK.

Soon as it came to light that Robert Rodriguez himself wasn't actually directing, red flags immediately began to fly. I'm not gonna spend all day going into detail on what this film got wrong but ultimately what it didn't get right which simply is its own identity. The film plays out entirely like a homage to the original. Everything from the jungle setting, and the bad ass team of prey to cues lifted directly from the original predator soundtrack are littered throughout the film. If the movie wanted to be as Rodriguez stated The ""Aliens"" sequel to the Predator franchise, it sorely lacked in comparison. If it wanted to be a re-imagining, there wasn't any imagination present in bringing something new, fresh or original. Finally if Predators was supposed to reboot the franchise, it sadly ends with a less than memorable impression.",Predators

Yakuza Hanzo was also a formidable foe regarding his acting ability; respectful.Isabelle carried a much needed persona of charisma to the film while Royce fulfilled all that was expected. The remainder of the actors were additions without any level of interest.Although, the ending was somewhat bongo, Royce carried a very sharp machete that would have made a big difference when attacking the blinded Predator of which he did not use...

Don't worry if you haven't seen the first two because contrary to popular belief it's not a reboot but a sequel that doesn't require much knowledge about it's history.

(Predator designed parachutes are rubbish) More soldier looking dudes fall from the sky... (We end up with a Yakuza, an Arnie double, a female sniper, a Doctor, a Convict, Danny Trejo, a Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy, and one dead body whose chute didn't open! (Told you they were rubbish)Arnie double gets close to a weird looking plant, which the doctor names in Latin and explains is a 'really dangerous plant' and could cause paralysis. Shortly the group enter a clearing and realise they are not on Earth (Nobody explains how the plant from Earth got there!)Cute little Predator pet dogs arrive and use up a lot of the casts bullets. After somebody whistles they go away again!..After a very short cameo by Danny Trejo who dies somehow, they arrive at the Predators gypsy camp where they see the Predator from the first film, alive and well, and he's into bondage! Three invisible Predators then attack them, and another member of the cast gets killed!After running through some scenes straight from the original Predator movie. Sliding down steep banks and falling into water etc, they decide it's time to hunt the predators. Situated as they are now in a shallow cave, with water in front of them and no way a creature could sneak up on them from behind, (solid rock) they decide to go off to the middle of a jungle clearing and set their traps! The sniper girl explains she's seen this all before in a movie called 'Predator' Nobody believes her.Another Predator arrives. Actually it's Morpheus from the Matrix. They decide to go off with Morpheus who plays a guy who dresses up as a Predator even though he's at least 2' shorter! They arrive at an old disused power station /Alien space ship / Ruin / Left over prop??? They have to crawl and stoop their way through this set, as it's very tight/claustrophobic/narrow. Morpheus gives a pep talk about how he's been trapped on the planet for years, but manages to scrape his way through by foraging for supplies at night. (Though whatever he's been eating has certainly kept his body fat index very high He is enormous!) Morpheus says it's past his bedtime and he's going to bed.Unexpectedly the room fills with smoke, ""We must get out of here for fear of suffocating in all this smoke!"" So they all light very very smoky red, orange and green flares and struggle to get out of the smoke filled room.Realising Morpheus is trying to steal their food, they blow a hole in the power station /Alien space ship / Ruin / Left over prop so as to attract attention of the Predators who they hope will be better hosts than wacky old Morpheus! This works, as 8' tall predators arrive who can stand completely upright in the massively tall tunnels the cast are using to vacate the power station /Alien space ship / Ruin / Left over prop thingy!The group manage to get back into the jungle and head towards the Predators Gypsy camp, where Morpheus told them earlier there may be a Predator ship to escape in. (Yeah like you'd believe him after he just tried to kill you)Then there's an amazing scene where King Kong guy gets loads and loads of red laser target dots all over his body from the dozens of Predators that are hunting him.Oh wait, no that's only in the trailer! Sorry!Using the sniper girl's telescopic sight as way of making sure there are no Predators in front of them, or at least in front of them 10 miles ahead, they make their way through the jungle. Well the cast all die one by one, (in even more ""homages"" to the first film) except for King Kong guy, sniper girl and the Doctor (who has his leg trapped, crushed and broken in a Predator trap).King Kong guy gets back to the gypsy site and releases the captured Predator from the first film, which repays him by starting up a Predator ship and directs it by wristband control to fly back to Earth. The Doctor and the sniper girl are captured and thrown into a pit by a very angry bad-ass Predator who has to fight and kill his now released Predator from the first film. King Kong guy runs off to the space ship, which then takes off and explodes!!!While they fight, the Doctor reveals he's secretly a psycho killer and paralyses the sniper girl with some juice from the plant shown at the beginning of the movie for people paying attention. (Bit stupid really, as she's his only chance of survival) And he also has an amazing healing factor as his ankle has repaired itself too!As the doctor creeps up on the sniper girl, King Kong guy appears, who never blew up after all. (phew!) He realises something's a-miss, fights the Doctor, paralyses him and then leaves him as bait by hiding a grenade device on the Doctors body, which kills the doctor but just pisses off the Predator.The Predator is just about to kill King Kong guy for making him look like a B movie monster, when sniper lady shoots the predator in the throat.

602,dillon123,Biggest let down in my personal cinematic history,1,16 July 2010,"Ever since I was 12 years old and saw the original Predator I have been hooked on sci/action films. So let me tell you that when I heard that a direct sequel to the original series had been made (bypassing AvP)m i was ecstatic. I went to see this film with 3 other lifelong predator fans and I've honestly never seen a worse movie at the cinema,my friends agreed.Scenery/Location Why should the predators drag humans all the way too another galaxy, just so the terrain should look like the woods near my house??, complete lack of imagination much more could have been done with that (look how well they did that in Avatar). I mean it is sci-fi after all, you go in expecting to see new, weird and wonderful things, not a boring earth like woods. Actors/ Acting No character development whatsoever, meaning you don't care about the characters when they die one bit, and there is way too much forcefully trying to act cool when ends up being the opposite. Compare that to the original where Dutch, Dillon and the rest did not need to say anything to be cool, you just kind of knew they were through there actions. You also cared about them too and did not want anyone to die in the original. Brody + 1 month of gym + CG muscle DOES NOT EQUAL ARNIE, i cant believe this guy (an Oscar winner took this horrible script).Plot/ StoryIf you've seen the original predator you already know exactly what is going to happen. They get dropped in to the planet, some die, and of course our hero survives. No new ideas whatsoever like trying to commandeer the alien ship - it seems far fetched but at least that would have been interesting..., The film kind of finishes at the worst possible point and you left wondering what the hell would happen next with them marooned on an alien planet - no food, shelter etc. Also the ironic twist where the doctor becomes a rapist is laughable, come one, the dudes marooned on a an alien planet, about to die and hes thinking about raping someone...?Miscellaneous Lawrence Fishburnes role is completely pointless, hes in the film for 2 minutes and for some reason tries to kill everyone else, horrible acting and horrible concept too. He then dies the easiest and most pointless death possible, I mean hes meant to be an expert at living on this planet and he dies that easily? There is a point when Fishburnes character talks about an alien ship, and there is talk of commandeering the ship, this was the only point the film where I was even remotely excited, but this plan is to bed quickly, as Fishburne dies pointlessly 2 minutes later. Also I was dismayed at the use of the original script, someone should tell the writer that is only good when you do it tastefully in small doses, not at every possible chance as in this movie, less is more. Especially when these lines are regurgitated by less then worthy actorsBottom line All in all, this film is directors warped vision of the original, some kind horrible reboot or even homage you could say, to the original. True predator fans stay away it will only end in disappointment",Predators
603,craiglandis,Epic Fail by IMDb regarding this movie,4,10 July 2010,"As I write this on the Saturday of opening weekend of Predators, it is sitting at a 7.6 rating on IMDb, with 36 percent giving it a 10/10.That makes it one of the most blatantly skewed ratings I have ever seen on IMDb, because this movie is awful. It is just plain bad. So it is clear to me that the studios have gotten pretty good at gaming the IMDb rating. I've noticed that opening weekend ratings are often skewed pretty high on IMDb, and it has only gotten worse. But Predators takes the cake in terms of a dreadfully bad movie getting an impossibly high rating for what it is.Why is it bad? The script is like a work of fan fiction, and not in a good way. When you are seeing a movie for the first time and you are completing the actor's lines before they are, clearly it is lacking in any originality. There is zero tension. Even the decent actors in this movie deliver very poor performances. But I think they simply had nothing to work with. There is only so much an actor can do to salvage bad writing. And in this case, there was nothing they could do.And the special effects are very underwhelming. What kills me is that the creature in the original Predator movie was much more impressive than the versions in Predators, where they simply look like kind of tall actors in Predator costumes.I won't go on and on about how bad it is because it has already taken two hours of my life away. But suffice to say that this is an extremely uninspired film which I am sure Adrien Brody will rank as one of his worst.And IMDb, the studio owned you on this one. This is nowhere near a 7.6, or even a 6 for that matter. Don't see it. Not even as a rental, which it will surely be in a month.",Predators
604,postm,Another failed attempt to breathe life into an old franchise,5,25 September 2010,"Many have tried to make sequels to classic films. People who are familiar with the Predator and Alien franchise (and how they were combined in the two AvP movies) know this. Some think the sequels are as good as the originals while others swear to the first movie of the franchise. i will not go into the entire series here, just Predators (which would be the third in the Predator series).The story is the foundation of any movie. Even simple stories can be good if the writers know what they're doing. Sadly, the writing is this movie's downfall. We never really get to know any of the characters and the scenes are all too familiar. The first half of the movie (well, maybe even the first 2/3) seems more like a homage to the first Predator film than a sequel. As if the writers were trying to recreate the atmosphere of the first one. But instead of coming up with an engaging story that provided that, they just threw some humans and some predators in a jungle and copied many scenes and ideas from the first movie. As much as I love the first Predator movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the story in it ain't all that complex. Still, it's a lot more engaging and we get to know the characters in a much more personal way. Well, maybe not, but they're all very different from each other and they're unique. That's why you remember them and that's why you care about them. Each in their own way. In this movie however, the characters are all the same. I don't even remember any of their names (or maybe they weren't mentioned).As the movie progressed I was sure I was gonna rate this a 4. However, I was surprised to see that the last half hour or so actually changed my mind. A few unexpected twists and turns made it more interesting to watch. Sadly the damage was already done.The entire movie suffered from bad writing and uninteresting characters. The cast wasn't all that either and well known names such as Adrien Brody and Laurence Fishburne was obviously picked for their fame and not their skills. Which is sad, because these two in particular got acting skills. They just didn't get to use it properly in this film.The cinematography was OK, but nothing special. And coupled with poor direction, suspense is nowhere to be found in this movie.I'd rate the first part of the movie a 4/10 and the last part 6/10. Which comes to an average of 5/10.Mindless entertainment perhaps, but it will only be remembered an another failed attempt to make a proper sequel.I'd like to see more sequels, because I strongly believe that it IS possible to make another good movie based around this fascinating creature.",Predators
605,fentoc,"Worth watching, but only if you do it without great expectations.",3,16 July 2010,"It's certainly not an awful film by any means. Predators gets from start to finish without any overly boring moments and manages to keep itself quite short, too. It's problems, though, are many.First of all, the characters. Didn't care about a single one of them, so when it came to those life or death moments, I found myself so uninterested in their survival I would have rooted for the Predators. It's not just the lack of acting skills portrayed, but a lack of depth written into their characters and an absolute void of anything you could possibly relate to or find likable about them. In fact, of all of them, the girl (Isabelle) was the only one I liked seeing on screen and that had nothing to do with her character at all since she was just as wooden as everyone else.The plot was actually too simple. I really do feel there should have been more effort put into a more intelligent plot line. The premise was fine, by all accounts, but the whole film just ends up totally pointless by the time it ends. I am sure they purposefully crafted the ending for an easy way into a continuation of this new Predator storyline, but I really don't wish to see it re-visited. I think there was more to the Predator when we knew less about them, but this film just used them as a vehicle for a fight and really nothing more.At one point, it did look like we may get an insight into the Predator's hierarchy or background when Laurence Fishburn's character started to explain the two types of Predator species, but they wrote themselves into a situation where none of them could possibly know anything about a Predator beyond what they have seen, so unfortunately nothing ever came of it. This 'new' Predator strain was actually pointless and unnecessary to the film, as it turned out. And you find yourself wanting the original Predator to kick the new one's behind simply because it's a much better design (the new one was a lot like a teenager's attempt at pimping his first car - a travesty on the original by simply adding go faster stripes/masks and huge spoilers/mandibles).But then there are the little things that go to ruin the credibility of all the story telling and acting that's going on in front of you. First of all they quite plainly were supposed to be in the thick of a jungle, yet it was filmed entirely at the edge of a small wood somewhere. There were only ever a few meters away from the edge of whatever forest they were filming in (look through the trees and see if the forest runs on, of do you see the clear skies, too?!). It just makes the whole thing too hard to believe in and then you're just watching an unconvincing lie. If you can't suspend belief for a film like this, it'll never work. Then there's other small problems, too, like the moment they get to the edge of the cliff and are all shocked to see the number of moons or planets sitting in the sky. Can someone please give me one good reason whey no one noticed that through the trees? And let's for one moment believe the trees were actually blocking any view they had of the sky, then please let me know why they couldn't see them when they were walking across that large clearing where Isabelle wanted to stop and rest...Nitpicking now, but a little quality control wouldn't go amiss. When they get to this big reveal they are on a different planet and they establish the reaction shot, look through the thin layer of tress behind them and you'll notice the blue flashing light of a police car driving along a road in the background.The only part of this film I actually enjoyed was the joke bones of ET in the Predator's lair.Saying that, it was still entertaining. The special effects didn't stand out which probably meant, for the most part, they were okay (aside from the Predator blood, mind, and the bad flame effects on the explosion when the Russian kills a Predator), the musical score was okay and suited the mood of the film quite well and it's always good to see and hear things from the Predator's point of view.I won't watch it again, though.",Predators

This sequel is no exception among the others to unveil a little more of the Predator ""culture"". HOWEVER, predictability and bad acting continue to drag this franchise down from its potential. When are we going to see the Predators hunt something truly ""BIGGER AND BADDER"" than they are? Think of the carnage if they battled the big monster scorpion thing that chased young James T. Kirk across the ice in the most recent Star Trek movie. Maybe the next sequel will involve a human stow-away who hitches a ride on a Predator starship and bears witness to their inter-galactic safari! Quality is somewhere in the middle: Pales in comparison to the original movie, but doesn't even come close to emanating Requiem's stink...maybe somewhere between P2 and AVP1.",Predators
609,rohit-maggon,Antal and Rodriguez show how its done,7,19 October 2010,"1987, Governor Schwarzenneger led his team of rag-tag soldiers to a jungle for a rescue op. What they found there (Predator) turned into one of the most memorable creatures to ever endorse the big screen. A number of attempts were made to bring the predator back on screen in a number of different settings but it became more about offering scenarios and explanations about predators as a culture by using the reputation of this magnificent hunter that the first movie had successfully built.2010, Nimrod Antal along with Robert Rodriguez decided to go back to the first encounter, and decided to build on that. What does one need to make a movie about hunters and their prey, a friggin' jungle. It just makes sense - hiding in trees, observing from a distance, not knowing who or what will attack you from behind, listening for sounds- I can go on and on. And with a fellow like Robert Rodriguez comes a reputation, a reputation to recruit the likes of Adrien Brody, Lawrence Fishburne, Alice Braga and Danny Trejo.As far as the story goes, it follows in the line of traditional survival horror tactics of having a large number of expendable characters and the big bad monster (monsters in this case). A mildly amusing story is there for those who wish to indulge in some cuckoo twists and turns but it does the job of moving things along, but the the icing on the cake is the expansion on the predators. There is more than one predator, all of them look different from each other confirming a hierarchy in their race and quadrupedal hunting animals controlled by the predators. This adds the much required diversity that predator as a franchise needed and works well in keeping the audience curious about what else can the creators think of.Performances for the most part are well done, especially Adrien Brody who seems to have put in a lot of work to buff himself up for the role. Only complaints on my part would be the ridiculousness of Lawrence Fishburne and Topher Grace. *Spoiler Topher Grace can never be an evil scheming villain*.The jungle is lush and is a character in itself full of surprises - makes for a fitting hunting ground. The background score again goes back to original movie and works well to create tension.The technology these days has allowed creators to add more detail to the predator designs and the weapons that they carry. The violence and gore look as disgusting and believable as possible which makes the brutality much more real.Overall, this is the much awaited true sequel fans have been waiting for which has its similarities with the original but is different enough to keep things interesting.http://magworldrohit.blogspot.com/",Predators

From Pianist to Predator-slayer?? Really? Couldn't you find anyone else Nimrod? Anyone at all?The rest of the cast were just as bad. And what a waste of Laurence Fishburne.

611,bannedontheland,Predators a wish come untrue,7,13 July 2010,"I love the original Predator movie and watched it at the cinema in 87.I own the special edition DVD and watched it many times.The movie i tend to watch when i am feeling sick and there's nothing on TV.The sequel with Danny Glover was also a DVD purchase and also another movie i originally saw at the cinema.The sequel in my opinion was weak and and does not hold a candle or (flaming torch in the jungle)compared to the original but it is still fun in parts. Anyway i am a fan as stated above and i was genuinely excited about this outing especially as it was going to be a ""true sequel to the original"".I am saddened to say i left the cinema feeling let down. The score was very similar and i will not go into the plot or spoil anything but i felt as if it was rushed in parts.The characters were very two dimensional.Saying that as i am writing this im thinking""i will buy the DVD when it comes out""Less jumps,less tension.No funny wisecrack humour . It did seem a little toned down,the original Predator was an 18,Predator2 also an 18. This an R16, that should not make a difference but maybe thats the reason it falls short slightly.

612,EricMatthewsWasCheated,"Decent movie, but a little too long",8,18 April 2011,"Predators is a decent film that entertains for a little longer than an hour and a half, though it felt a bit longer. The action and tension really picks up in the second half, and while it isn't hard to figure out who's going to die next, the action scenes are fun to watch with good camera work and neat special effects.Adrien Brody does a good job of playing the mysterious lead whom everyone (including the audience) is trying to figure out as the movie goes on, though throughout the movie he's constantly wearing less and less clothing until the end, where he's completely topless (is that a win for the female audience?) The movie has an interesting collection of characters, ranging from murderers to ex-military to drug lords. Seeing them go back and forth with their contrasting personalities is entertaining, but nothing we haven't seen before.Overall, Predators is a fun way to waste an afternoon. The story, writing, characters, and overall the entire movie isn't going to stick with you, but this is a great popcorn flick and worth watching if you wanna relax after a hard day's work, or you love the previous movies in the series.",Predators
613,lazercobra98,Surprisingly good!!,8,10 July 2010,"Being a HUGE fan of the first Predator film, I was reluctant to even see this one...but I had to. After reading the previous reviews, I generally agree with most in that this film scores big with the various similarities of the original (ie: jungle setting and different characters all with their own strong personalities. First what I didn't like was the darting around with the development of the characters. Unlike the first film, you get bits and pieces of who each character is with maybe the exception of Adrian Brody's character and the very short lived Larance Fishburn's character ( I really thought his part should have played more in the film with the helmet and his knowledge, etc.It would have been much better IMHO)Also more scenes of the Predator creatures moving and hunting(as in the first and one before this)would have been much more enjoyable. I did love the idea of the rogue Predator befriending the humans and would have liked to see more action with him after he was freed.All in all a refreshing change from the ""running out of ideas"" road that the series seem to have been heading. I was pleasantly pleased with how this turned out.A must see for any original (or new) Predator fan. Now get to the chopper!!",Predators
614,s_armriding,What's going on with films today?,1,18 August 2010,"I'm dumbstruck. Is it the writers? The Directors? The Producers? What's going wrong? Honestly! I feel I'm being patronised.I've been a fan of the Predator 'franchise' since way back when it all started. I even enjoyed Predator 2 to some extent. Albeit wasn't the original by any means, but at least it had suspense, depth. More importantly it was made in a time when those involved in making a film seemed like they actually cared! But what the hell was this??? The script was flimsy, the acting amateur, the dialogue atrocious, the suspense had been suspended... Where was all the mystery? Lets back up a bit...See, this is where I'm coming from. What makes a film for me is the mystery, the suspense, that question of who or what is out there. Especially when it comes to a sci fi, thriller or horror. For example, what gave Saw such a fresh feel was that you had absolutely no idea who was pulling the strings right until the last 30 seconds. As the film progressed it suggested red herrings. When you take away that mystery you've blown your load. There's nothing left to give, which make it harder to make any kind of impact following this. The Usual Suspects another great film because it kept you in the dark. Even Cloverfield had an air of mystery as you never really knew what was going on or what it was - the thing was always just out of shot.However, I haven't seen a great monster/alien movie in a long long time. Everything seems to be slasher rubbish. That's not interesting... And been done again and again and again. There's nothing new in that genre any more.So, when it was announced there was to be a revival of the Predator franchise... and that Robert 'Desperado' Rodriguez was making it I thought 'Great, this should be worth watching'.But...These are the problems: Lack of feeling, a 'believable' true emotion. You can't be scared for the character if you don't feel they're terrified. In the original movie you could feel it. Poncho trembled profusely in the original when proclaiming to Billy 'You know something, what is it?'. They've tried to tap into the same thing here when - I think it was the Russian - glared up into a tree at an 'invisible' predator.They blew their load way to early. The predator chained up with its head down to be fair was pretty freaky. But after that whole sequence it was gone, the mystery of what was out there had gone. Especially as that predator bird/scout/tracking device flew back onto a predators shoulder mount gave you a 'parade' of the bad guys. It was almost like a fashion show! Here's one uncloaking, check him out.. oh and another, he looks slightly more bad ass... and the 'daddy', check him out, he looks overweight and has a jawbone stuck to his helmet!! He must be really 'hard'!! For f**ks sake people, it's not WWE, it's supposed to be a serious film.Way too much cheese for my liking. For a while I could smell so much I thought we were in France.The predators themselves. Yeah OK, they still look pretty cool. But there's no sleekness to them anymore. All the actors who played them have done some serious heavyweight 'bad guy' characters in the past, but they've clearly not done their homework. Why didn't they study the way that Kevin Peter Hall (geniusly) portrayed the predator in the first 2 films? The way he moved, postured, was almost creepy enough in itself. Why were they all about 2 feet too short too?! The original when Arnie was up against the tree at the end there was clearly enough room for a 2 year old to stand below his dangling legs! I think they should've opted for taller, more slender actors than reasonably tall muscle bound ones. By the time the suits were on them they looked overweight and clumsy. Kevin Peter Hall was what, 7'8""? Something like that. But built like a basketball player, the 'build' was in the suit, not under it. He looked fast, streamlined.Lawrence Fishburne.Topher Grace.Adrian Brody.The token female. That really really awful attempt at throwing in a twist with the 'serial killer' sub plot. Why? Overall it appears though that there is just too many cooks spoiling the broth these days. Perhaps it's influence from the studios to include certain aspects, or to be filmed and presented in a certain manner. Does there have to be factors that are met now to appease the suits? Certain boxes must be ticked so to play things safe and appeal to a mass audience. Whatever is happening it's sucking the very life out of movie making. Where is the love? The passion? Or is it all about the money? If it's all about the money I can tell you this, keep making movies like this and it will drive away the audience from going to watch them. No more money! Everyone will just wait for TV and not pay at all. That would be a shame.Here's a suggestion: Find the love and passion in 'making' films again.Stop trying to pander to the masses (or just teen audiences, something else that's ruining the movie business). If the studios are trying to get involved and influence things in a certain way, please stop! YOU ARE RUINING THE CREATIVITY! Did Da Vinci have someone leaning over his shoulder telling him how needs to paint? Did Shakespeare have an outside influence batting things a certain way? No. I may be wrong but... I think they did OK on their own...Stop trying too hard!",Predators

617,LionelN,This movie is to avoid like the plague!,3,22 October 2010,"I am generally easy to satisfy. I love all types of movies and I am quite bulimic. As cinema is my favourite hobbies, I tend to consume 4-5 films per week and thus I am perfectly aware that I will not meet each time chef d'oeuvre. Consequently, I have the tendency to be very lenient about the entertainment ability of a film. I will enjoy it if the film has something original (a setting, an idea, etc. ) or if the scenario does not have too many inconsistencies. Also I do not have anything against a remake as long as it delivers better visuals. However I consider this film one of the worst one I have seen in a while.SpoilerThis film is a disappointment on every grounds. Where Predator 2, AvP, AvP2, without being good movies, brought at least a few original ideas (new surroundings, a 3rd creature, politically incorrect gory moments, and so on), this film lacked everything. The scenario is exactly the same as the first Predator movie. A predator (here three) is hunting in the jungle well armed soldiers. To avoid being a complete rip off, this film adds a few ramifications in this scenario. Instead of 1 predator, it has 4. Cool!!! No, it is not! When Hollywood will understand that overbidding only works when it is done on both sides of the equation? James Cameron has perfectly understood this simple concept. If you want more Aliens, then you must have well-armed marines in the other camp! If you want a new bad-ass terminator, you need a T800 with the good guys. Here we have three super predators against the same number of humans that the first movie. It does not make them more frightening, it just made them weaker and more powerless! Now instead of a hunter, we have 3 dumb tough guys without any sense of tactics and brains. Furthermore this movie has so may bad clichés it is unbelievable! For example, does the Japanese really need to fight a one and one sword ""kamikaze"" fight? The Japanese vibe is finished guys, Kill Bill was made ten years ago! The predator should have just kill him with his gun for his stupidity, that would have been funny and earns the film a few credits ! another example, the only character that did not really belong to the group (not a fighter)is actually more than we think, he is a serial killer! We did not see this one coming, did we? Although, I wonder what the one on the death row did (probably steal ponies) if crazy doctor was really the most hideous one. If that was not enough, this film is also full of inconsistencies... The bright doctor (of course the unarmed bright civilian needs to be a doctor) knows botany?! Do doctors have an extensive knowledge of plant species? Especially one from a foreign planet!? He should also have know in which solar system they were. After all doctors also know astronomy, don't they? Anyway, in short this film is to avoid like the plague! Nearly nothing can be saved!Apart from a few visuals and the opening. Starting with a free fall was quite a good idea. That was a very effective opening. We really felt disoriented! It was the only time we felt in the character's shoes.",Predators

Sure its a good movie if all you want to see is shooting and explosions and nothing else, but for a real movie with real characters and a real plot this film lacks. I only gave it a 4/10 because i only like Laurence Fishburne and the score. I highly advise you to stay away from this movie if you like characters and plot because you wont get any of that.

Intelligent in pacing and writing, the characters work, they are exactly as one dimensional as an action hero / cast should be. The special effects were used sparingly which is wonderful considering the tendency to try to make everything on green screen these day. Explosions and gun play were also intelligently used, which is nice considering the story behind the first predator movie. Overall this adds some more depth to the predator history, and as one of the movie monster of my generation, the more it is fleshed out the better it will get. Sadly In a day and age where the likes of Ryan Reynolds, Edward Norton, Toby McGuire and the other lame hero hipster actors it is no surprise its not on the top five.Lastly on the off chance that some one of note in the industry reads this, the set up for the sequel was well done, however please do not make the same mistakes as other movie have made, throwing money at the sequel will not necessarily make it better, so easy on the the effects budget.",Predators
621,TraversH,You will be underwhelmed.,2,12 July 2010,"Nearly every movie I've seen I tend to agree with its ratings on IMDb, but something smells fishy in the case of Predators. Nearly all of these reviews seem too good to be true, and as often the case, it is. Usually I would take the time to write a complete review weighing the strengths and weaknesses of a movie, but I felt let down at every turn. There was nothing impressive or remarkable about Predators. The visuals were less than stimulating, and I understand that it's set on a forest planet, but it seems there were all of three different sets blandly created: Forest, Predator base in the forest and bleak interior of a giant machine. The writing was very poor, myself and those around me took some amusement in guessing what a character would say before it was said. There were no memorable performances, and I think it would be safe to give the benefit of the doubt to the actors, there was no writing of any depth. I concur with those who I saw it with, it was very disappointing. The rating it has currently seems preposterously high, almost artificially inflated. Watching predators was very much like drinking mud, it's not very pleasant and the whole time you wonder why you are doing it; that said, there is no fowl aftertaste in doing so because you will forget it almost immediately.",Predators

Characters were not solid - we aren't given any explanation or description of the characters' histories, let alone how they got onto this mysterious planet.Secondly, the plot was awful. A bunch of guys are abducted, and sent plunging down to the predators' planet to be hunted - no more detail is given (how did they get there? and why are they there, apart from being the predator's prey? Who chose them?)Thirdly, boring. Well done to those who made it through the first 40 minutes of the movie - those who didn't, you're not alone. In these 40 minutes, the group of survivors are shown to be 'wandering in the jungle' aimlessly, ""trying to find a way off the planet"" - no background music; and again, no explanations given either. Fourthly, the predators' appearances are somewhat lacking. 80% of the movie = no predators, just the survivors exploring the jungle. And when there were predators around, there wasn't enough action. Sure, the final part of the movie where the two predators fought each other, and the baddie fought Adrien Brody, but that lasted 10 minutes only.I had high expectations from this movie - I came crying (not literally) out of the movie; the poorly written plot without any explanation whatsoever, awful acting, senseless bits and pieces everywhere and, as if this wasn't enough, the lack of action (I have to say, if more action scenes were filmed, hey, at least it'd have compensated!)To those who're looking for a movie with an actual story: Don't waste your time.To those who love big explosions/action: Be prepared to be disappointed at the lack of action.",Predators

First of all, the beginning was copied from ""Saw"" or ""Cube"" (bunch of somehow related people, who do not remember how they got there). Another thing – the person who was in charge of decorations and costumes should be fired. I mean, should we believe that Russian specnaz in Caucasus carry Gatling guns and wear American equipment (pay attention to the backpack). Nonsense. One more flaw – the Predators have infrared vision and do see warm objects. If the object is cold (i.e. covered with mud, tree branches, rocks, etc.) – they don's see them or see not so clearly. So my question is: how the predator could see Japanese sword? It should be invisible to him or at least not clear. In that case, the Japanese killer should have won the battle without any trouble. And what we saw? A sword stand from middle ages? C'mon I liked the casting. Some good actors appeared in the movie (Brody, Fishburn, Taktarov, etc.).

625,Thrash505,Job Well Done!,9,24 July 2010,"This film was really well done and makes a great addition to the movie series; despite what the other reviewers who gave this movie a bad rating say.Its as simple as this: If you want to see stuff blow up, guns firing, traps going off, people getting ripped apart, predators getting ripped apart, predators fighting each other for the first time, the inside of a predator ship, comical references from the first film, the black dude getting bumped off first for no reason (ironically the guy who looked the most bad-ass to me), suspense, unpredictable and cool plot, a sweet ending that leaves plenty of room for another film, and special appearance from a bad-ass character from another Sci-FI/Action film series, then this movie is for you.If you're looking at the past through rose-colored glasses and think Predator 1 was the best movie of all time with great acting, character development, and emotional ties to the audience when a character was bumped off, then its most definitely not for you. Don't get me wrong, I love the first movie and seen it more then 50 times when I was a kid. But don't be ridiculous! THESE ARE ACTION MOVIES for crying out loud!

626,quantumSheep27,A staggering disappointment,6,10 August 2010,"I had high expectations for this movie. The way Robert Rodriguez was hyping it up, pretty much saying how it will reboot the franchise (which had been effectively killed by the ""Alien Vs. Predator"" movies) made it seem that Predators would be an excellent movie, on the same level as the first Predator film (and the second, since I rate both Predator movies 9/10). However, instead of the exciting, testosterone-fuelled action movie I was expecting, the viewer is presented with a mess, a travesty of a film that further hurts the Predator franchise. Dear me, Mr. Rodriguez, it seems you stuffed up big-time.The plot is simple: a bunch of unlikeable cardboard characters get dropped on an alien planet and soon discover that they are being hunted by the signature Predator alien warriors. An action movie does not need a complicated plot, so this somewhat vague storyline is understandable. However, that does not mean the filmmakers should slack off on everything else. The acting is half-decent, although lead star Adrien Brody puts on a Batman voice and comes across as one of the least likable characters in the film. Actors of note in this movie include Danny Trejo as a Mexican gang enforcer and Laurence Fishburne as a crazy survivor living on the planet. Unfortunately, both characters get barely any lines and screen-time before they are shabbily killed off. Those two men should have been the stars, not Adrien Brody and that guy who plays the annoying convict character. Don't get me started on the other characters as well, since most are two-dimensional and end up dead by the end of it. Seriously, what is Topher Grace doing in a movie like this? He should stick with ""That 70s Show"" (although that show stopped a while back so he's probably accepting any acting job that comes his way in order to pay off the bills).The signature aliens, the Predators, have barely any screen presence at all. Unlike in the first two Predator movies, where the Predator has an imposing screen presence (probably due to the performance of the late Kevin Peter Hall, who played the titular alien in both Predator and Predator 2), the Predators in this movie seem to have all been played by chubby middle-aged men and move around like any actor would while wearing a heavy costume (slow and wobbly). Whatever fear the Predators had in the first two movies is gone in Predators.What really strikes me is how Robert Rodriguez thinks Predator 2 is a bad movie when it is clearly superior to Predators. You should keep your franchise reboot scripts locked up before they hurt anymore popular franchises, Mr. Rodriguez. His film, Predators, is so full of homages to the first film that it becomes derivative and clichéd: homages aren't bad unless they are executed badly and Predators tries to imitate the first film every chance it gets and does it badly.I would rate this a 5/10, but the way it sucks the viewer in from the beginning (until the end credits roll, when said viewer realizes how much of a mess the movie was) I'll give it a 6/10.Seriously, go watch Predator and Predator 2 instead.",Predators

Probably not as memorably as some of the characters in the first film but nevertheless it works fine.I like the added predator dogs and the fact that there are two types of Predator that don't like each other. (Not overly keen on the main Predator face though).All in all, I wasn't disappointed.

Adrian Brody had developed the Christian bale voice at times and even used Arnie's classic line from the first ""do it do it now kill me"" his fight with the super black predator was a joke and made the predator look so dumb. if this movie could not of got any worse they decided to put a serial killer in the mix of it all which i am sorry was just done awful as he decides to show his evil side at the point which he has just been captured by the predators (so he should be scared right, serial killer or not, looking for way out right, looking for help with his fellow prisoner right, wrong he will just decide to try and kill her in he mix of it all, so bad. Laurence Fishburne not much to say here really but what a waste of time and guess what they stole classic lines from the first movie again with him. the lack of predators was a disappointment as was the lack of hunting by them, they also seemed to forgot that the predators have some pretty good weapons but chose to use none of them in this movie (maybe 2 or 3 shoulder cannon shots but that is it, not even the classic spear was in this. i did watch this movie with 3 others who all were very very disappointed. oh and one more thing remember the trailer when Adrian Brody had about 20 predator target aims all over his body, yeah this did not happen try just ONE instead, to sum up a pile of crap.",Predators

But this Predator is pretty cool and different. The story is kept simple with a primary plot. The movie is about the jungle, it takes back to the roots. It starts with people falling from the sky into the jungle on a different planet. Group of elite warriors, with there weapons, they are in the jungle and the hunt is on.In this predator they have borrowed heavily from the first predator, If you look at the cast, they have the same exact amount of warriors which they had in the first movie and with the same sound track which adds the effects to make it a lot better. The predators here just don't come out and start killing people, but they stay hidden and using hunting tactics, that's what its about, getting hunted with the creepy scared feeling.The actors in the movie have acted really well, which you hardly find in sci-fi movie these days. Adrien Brody has done a good job. Topher Grace, who adds a dark comical relief to the character is amazing in his role. He even makes all the characters come together making the movie better. The new predators with there dogs looks amazing, ya huge alien dogs with there huge tusks.But hey, Topher Grace recognizing a plant on a alien planet, total bullshit. The predators history, I mean the showcase of culture of predators where the bigger predators hunt the smaller ones was unnecessary in the movie, the first predator didn't have it, but still its the coolest one, why do we need it now in this one. Laurence Fishburne was a total waste in the movie with his small role. The CGI of the movie is not so great to watch and its minimal. It could have been a lot better (take Avatar for example).But overall the movie is cool to watch. This is the best sequel to the old predator from 23 years ago.

630,m-saltishev,"Definitely not the ""Predator 3""",3,8 July 2010,"Being a fan of the first two Predators I was really hoping this would be a good sequel and it would take place among others as ""Predator 3"" considering the promising crew, actors and experience of ""what not to do"" after the release of AVP. But as far as the movie progressed I've realized that it won't. And the same reason why it was surprisingly called ""Predators"" could be explained with author's doubts about this movie to be really ""one of the franchise"". Authors were indeed trying to make something worthy of Mr. McTiernan's masterpiece: here we can see true intention of ""returning to the roots"" which is shown via the main music theme, many references to the first Predator like jungles, big guns, hand-to-hand fights between us and aliens (which wasn't even mentioned to humans as an option in AVP series) and so on. There was an attempt to create the atmosphere of suspense, doom and terror among characters while them being hunted by the deadly creatures on the unknown planet. However the bad script and tones of inappropriate conversation really wasted that intention. The good thing about the first Predator was the balance between the ""words and action"", as well as the development of characters: even though they don't talk much, they all are individual and memorable. That was spoiled in ""Predators"" (especially with one of the characters being both improbable and anecdotal at once). The references mentioned above could be considered no less then plagiarism because there are just too many of them. And the last and foremost bad thing – the Predator itself. First of all, there was no development in predator technology. OK, these are just well-known to us alien guys with familiar shoulder cannons and wristle blades. But come on? Where are the new weapons? That is supposed to be minor but still a very important aspect of the predator movies. While admitting the fact that the second movie wasn't that good as the original of 1987, they have at least developed creature's armory by adding various net-guns, spears and flying disks which obviously have facilitated our final judgments. Unfortunately here we have nothing new, (no guns even from the second Predator and AVP movies) except the idea ""I have seen it already"". Secondly, their strength and skills which are outnumbered by humans. Predator being that big and powerful could make you tremble due to a single idea of what he could do to a person just with his bare hands. Here predators are depicted so weak versus Mr. Brody (let's be honest - not quite an ""action hero"") and the rest that I didn't understand: who's hunting whom? I think the biggest mistake since ""Predator 2"" is in development of perception of these aliens being now ""warriors"" instead of ""hunters"" as it was originally intended. Mr. McTiernan made Predator a stealthy and patient creature which fully shows up only once in a while, when situation is really asking for a fast, open and aggressive behavior. But in most cases Predator is ""waiting somewhere close"", taking advantage of his speed and various technological tricks to silently hunt people and doesn't use that pathetic courage and generosity. Making him a warrior has affected the whole atmosphere of the movie which is now a pure entertainment and CGI instead of original slight line between a science-fiction and thriller. My conclusion: If taking it independently - a mediocre entertainment movie (considering many goofs and low script). But as a sequel - the worst movie in a Predator franchise. 3 of 10.",Predators

The rest of the characters are decently sculpted and on par with the original, particular shout-outs to Walton Goggins and the guy who played Hanzo, hope to see you crop up in more films in future. The amount of action is good and the fight scenes absolutely immense, particularly the one involving the sword. All in all the best sequel since Aliens, though it does feel very similar to the original - not necessarily bad but certainly for the next film things need to go in a new direction.I think this will be a strong competitor against The Expendables as the best action film of 2010.",Predators

In a word, SH*T!",3,8 July 2010,"I am a massive Predator fan and have been ever since I saw the film over 20 years ago as a 7 year old boy. Predator 2 was a fine addition but sadly – no Arnie, so it was always going to struggle. This film however, doesn't even come close to either of them.The story is flawed form the outset. A new breed of Predators that abducts Earth's most fierce killers/warriors to fly them across the galaxy only to effectively shoot fish in a barrel. Good one! Also, why set the movie on an alien planet that looks exactly like the woods down the road?! The predators themselves are thick and dispatched easily - you would have thought the makers would have learnt from the disgrace that was AVP & AVP2. An advanced warrior/hunter species who have overcome all of life's boring problems to be left only with feeding their proverbial monkeys by hunting a variety of alien beings with the best boys' toys imaginable. Wicked!!! Yet they are able to be killed by a man with a large knife or incapacitated by a little bit of fire and a scrawny dude with a bat. Rubbish! The Predator dogs are poorly done and pointless. The new breed (well the only one we actually see) looks just like the creature development akin to Gremlins 2, but no where near as entertaining! There is no weapon development. The camouflage doesn't look anywhere near as convincing as the 1987 version - a worrying fact since it was done over 20 years ago.The characters are thin and poorly conceived with no one to actually like or relate to. Laurence Fishburn is the worst thing in this film - and very fat too since he's supposed to have been scavenging for food for the last 10 years (seasons).The dialogue is poor - its the first time I've heard rape being used as an attempt at humour and the best line to illustrate just how bad the writing is - Laurence Fishburn's line when asked how to kill the Predators - 'however you can' - very helpful, no really that's great! All in all, a massive let down - again. I still haven't gotten over AVP since, with today's special effects capabilities we can transfer anything imaginable onto the screen. Yet, AVP came out looking just like an episode of Power Rangers with blokes in rubbers suits rolling around on the floor. This latest addition to the crippled franchise is no better.Christopher Nolan - please rescue this mistreated concept before it's (if not already) ruined forever.

633,bladeomega10,Predators is on par with predator 2 which I like almost as much as the first.,7,10 July 2010,"""This planet is a game Preserve, and we're the game."" Predator's was originally intended to be made back in 1996 By none other then Robert Rodriguez(sin city,spy kids) to be the sequel Predator fan's wanted. Arnold Schwarzenegger was to reprise his role from the first film and was to include many different species of alien creatures(Not aliens for the alien series). But after Predator 2 bombed at the box office (Which is a shame because I like predator 2,It was a damn good sequel and deserves more recognition then It got) The idea ultimately dropped for the two very poorly made AVP films done by people who generally either cared more for aliens (I'm sorry Paul Anderson but do you honestly expect me to believe that one alien could kill 2 predators?) or were pro predator(Alien's felt like cannon fodder in comparison to the original movie series). So now we have what the newest attempt to bring the predator franchise(and hopefully fox's reputation) back to it's former glory.Many years have passed sense 1996, And Arnold appears to be too busy with the budget crisis to ""get the the choppa!"". So the script was re written with a new plot with a similar concept. The basic premise is that a group of humans are kidnapped and dropped into what seems like a regular jungle, but they soon realize that this is no ordinary jungle. and that they are being hunted by (You guessed it!) Predators. When I first heard the story concept I was a little bit concerned, And then the casting of Adrian Brody(The pianist,splice) and Topher grace(that 70's show,spider man 3) in the movie was something there really made me kinda angry, You went from Arnold to Danny Glover to Adrian Brody? But after seeing a few trailers and watching the character videos they came out with months ago, I began to trust the choices in casting.OK enough beating around the metaphorical bush. Predator's Is a great movie, The only real flaw it has is that It references the first film one too many times(one liners,old painless, a few similar scenes,Even the end credit's have a fun reference to the first film) This is something that makes most remakes/reboots suffer, they try too hard to be the original they almost lose their own identity, Predator's gets away with it simply because It's different enough that it still feels like it's own film despite the nods to the original.I thought the cast did a very good job, this is probably the best acting out of all the films in the series, Adrien Brody did a very good job playing a bad ass and Topher Grace was surprisingly entertaining. All of the other actors were believable and very fun to watch, You actually care about these characters despite the fact that they are killers. If that isn't good writing I don't know what is.Visual's are good, some slight visual problems in regard's too some of the CGI in the film, but it all fit together very well. Loved the jungle, glad to see it back.The sound was also great with the score,similar too predator one and two's excellent scored, but also put it's own twist on it. I'm kind of upset that the original predator scream isn't heard through the movie. but that is a slight down fall.One scene in particular that I enjoyed very much was the duel, In which Hanzo(Yakuza assassin) takes up a Katana and fight's one of the predators in a one on one sword duel, the cinematography and how well the fight was choreographed along with the background and tall grass really made the scene something remarkable.Predator's gets an 8.5/10 It's not perfect, but damn was it entertaining.",Predators

Nimrod Antal has created, or even reborn (at least reinvigorated), this franchise. Dating all the way back to 1987, with the original Predator, I have not seen a better remake involving the Predators. Sure, Alien and especially Aliens blew it out of the park thanks to top notch directing and money to burn, but this film is different entirely. Short on money, the film-makers here decided to go for acting and low-cost, high quality, REAL special effects. And got it they did. The acting from this cast of characters is some of the most top notch of any franchise movie in recent history, even given a few plot quirks (Laurence Fishburne dies after only 15 minutes on screen after surviving 10 seasons on this planet?)(the 'doctor' is actual a serial murderer who has really freaky knowledge about poisonous compounds? What?). Otherwise, I would contend it was an extremely solid, respectable reboot, with actors Adrien Brody and Alice Braga definitely coming to the forefront, not only because of their roles in the film, but because of their abilities as actors. I recommend, not highly, just recommend.

Viewing the trailers I thought it looked fairly promising, new looking predators and a similar looking setting to the original.I thought the film started well, good character development and an interesting cast. It was paced well and wasn't just an all out action packed mess with no meaning like AVP:R. The film drew me in like the original and kept me interested. There was quite a few homages to the original of course; for me some where nice and welcoming to see but some was just plain stupid and just didn't have to be put in there at all. A perfect example of this for me was the Billy tribute; when Mahershalalhashbaz Ali's character looked up into the tree suspiciously, 'sensing' something was there just like Billy did in the original, that was a bit of a face palm moment for me.But my biggest complaint of the movie was when it came to the most important thing about the movie: the predators, it all felt a bit rushed. There wasn't much predator screen time, and before we knew it 2 of these so called 'super predators' had been killed. What I loved was what they did to the Black super predator's appearance under the mask, giving the predator look a new twist and making him look pretty badass.So all in all fairly mixed reactions, a well made movie and a good effort, but for a movie named 'predators' there wasn't quite enough predator involvement for me.",Predators

The middle of the film was interesting and had a fair amount of action to keep you watching, gave a good surprise and didn't lack in the storytelling aspect either. Some characters really deserved more time in the movie than others but when they went, they really went off well and they all have a unique way that they are killed.The end of the movie was, well, very predictable and yet had a very good pace to it as well as twists that kept my heart racing and really getting into the story and wanting to see the next shot and the next in so much anticipation.All in all the movie was a lot better than i expected, there were so many homages thrown in that i nearly lost count but they didn't make me cringe and say ""Wow, they shouldn't have tried to pull that off"". I was satisfied by this movie but am still disappointed that Rodriguez is shoving P2 aside to put this in second spot.

639,vass912,Decent Action Flick... insult to Predator,4,13 July 2010,"Let's start with the good. It's a fun movie. The characters, if you read between the lines, are all interesting if a bit underdeveloped. Topher Grace's 'Doctor' is a standout but you'll have to wait until the end to see why. Royce (A. Brody) Does a serviceable job and I for one was glad to see no one tried to out-arnie arnie. Royce embodies a different type of soldier, a mercenary, lithe, smart, and jaded. The rest of the cast just is middle of the road (with the damn near criminal underused of Trejo standing out) mostly just there to die. The sound work is sharp with the score and effects taking notes from the first and second Pred movies. Visual effects are good also, but sometimes unnecessarily flashy, like the de-cloaking preds who now return to the land of the visual with a bit more flair. Still nothing bad there. In fact as an action movie this was a rather solid outing, it's with the Predators that the production failed. So, the bad? It's hard to believe that the awesome Predator is the flaw of the movie but it is. Remember the relentless stalking, the playful nature with witch the original creature pursued its prey? Gone. The predators here hardly do any active hunting. But OK, maybe they were busy hunting the other things - the creatures in the crates? My biggest gripe is with the pred's just plain suck. Arnold, a monster of a man who could convincingly portray a robot killing machine barely survived an encounter with one. Murtaugh and a dozen specially trained ex-military agents knowing what they were up against failed to kill one. Yet here the greatest hunter is defeated too easily. Never mind these are ""SuperPredators"" One somehow fails to notice the contrasting shape of a land mine on a human body (thermal vision anyone?) another gets stabbed with a sword, twice (my memory might be murky, but didn't Danny Glover unload a semi automatic hand cannon into one at close range and manage to only anger it?) and the last? beaten to death with a club by the dude from the piano... SuperPredators??? What's super about them? They seem to be roughly the same size. They use exactly the same technology (a normal pred and a super pred both seem to have remotes for the same space ship on their bracers) They have less weapons, and less inventive weapons... They are uglier... but that's about it. It was a gimmick, ""Bigger & Badder"" doesn't always mean better. The only thing the Supers did was undermine the entire mythology of the predator. Gone was the hunt... no hunter uses a preserve. If you're hunting you better be in the prey's home environment, taking the prey out of its comfort zone and placing it in an area designated for hunting takes the sport out of it. This wasn't predator, it was that old vice president with less friends to shoot at. The mixture of technology and savagery controlled by unrelenting respect for the sport, the honor of the predators the ultimate hunters was the victim of this rewrite.... but again... it was kind of fun to watch. p.s., fox, if you want a really really cool idea for a predator movie, one that is both faithful to the creature and pushes the boundaries of what we've seen....

He does what you'd expect someone in his situation to do.They are special forces commandos surely they would conserve ammo and not blow it all on the first thing that twitches?...

This really made all the difference for me anyway.My only real criticism is that the doctor's plot line was a a little cliché at the end. It's a combat unit and he's the medic it doesn't need any more explanation. I didn't agree he was out of place. That and the jungle could of looked a fraction more ""Alieny"".

644,jdmoody2020,The sequel that needed to exist.,8,9 July 2010,"For a very long time Predator has stood as one of my favourite films of all time with a great cast of characters and brilliant set pieces allowing the film to have a great pace that doesn't let up. Let's just say I had a lot of expectations before going to see this film.The iconic elements that made the film so great were however mostly forgotten when the first sequel was made in 1990. Everything from the composed theme to the build of tension was lost in the pursuit of quick dirty action and mostly irrelevant dialogue between the main cast. Fortunately Gary Busey was around to act crazy and bring a layer of cheese to the film that was surprisingly welcome.Two spin offs later and 20 years and we have Predators a film that much more clearly defines itself as a shameless sequel that takes all the right elements from the first film and a largely clichéd but dynamic cast of characters and throws them into a new world. Unlike the previous sequel and spin off films, Predators correctly builds tension and moves the narrative forward with a fair amount of explanation for why each character was chosen for the hunt.Most of the cast actually gave an at least forgivable performance with most of the characters having some great lines throughout and making it far more difficult to watch them fall one by one.When the films gets round to exposing the true threat of the new Predators the film shifts gears to allow for a lot more action and pretty neat death sequences without feelings like it's trying to one up the previous film.The only major hindrance to the pace and a decidedly thinly veiled exposition of what's happened in the past two decades since the original incident comes around half way through with Lawrence Fishburne acting a little too crazy and not in a Gary Busey good way. The other main issue is the a few minor sequences of CGI which look mostly average when compared to the cloaking effect that looks far better than it has ever before.Eventually the film picks up again and finishes off with some odd yet pretty well filmed action sequences and a few last twists that don't necessarily catch the audience off guard but none less are enjoyable.Overall I found the experience deeply satisfying and I strongly believe this is the worthy successor to the original Predator and I think many will be surprised that Adrien Brody gave a good performance as the protagonist and actually served as a welcome addition to the cast rather than a detriment to the film.The film also expands the fiction far enough for the franchise to continue down this direction if they wish to, and I wouldn't mind at all if they do continue the franchise.",Predators

I would have preferred if they just remade the first movie, then at least they could have justified having the same scenes. This movie was saved by two things. 1. The acting. (Laurence Fishburne was best - also acting in some of the non-ripped off scenes. Second best: Topher Grace.) 2. The special effects.

Then as you continue on in the movie the writing gets worse, the music doesn't fit, and the acting is questionable, but again you think, 'Okay.

647,Rossco1986,Bad Bad Bad,1,10 July 2010,"Being a massive predator fan, i was was glad to hear alan silvestri's original score back at the beginning of this movie and it made me think 'this could be one for the fans!'. How wrong i was. The good people at 20th Century Fox obviously wanted to make a fast buck using the Predator franchise and con fans with a decent looking trailer most of which didn't even appear in the movie (particularly Adrien Brody being targeted by around 10 predators at once when in reality its just one predator targeting). The script was just awful with all the stupid childish comedy moments and lines. I mean if I was dropped in a jungle after being abducted by aliens I certainly wouldn't be saying 'Your ass is awesome!' or planning on a cocaine and 'bitch raping' spree. So much of Predator 1987 was copied very badly. Blaine being replaced with a Russian who carried an old painless style gun, the yakuza guy staying back armed with a samurai sword instead of a machete just like Billy and Adrien Brody SLAUGHTERING Schwarzeneggers 'DO IT! DO IT NOW! KILL ME!' when fighting that god awful looking super predator. Stan Winston would be spinning in his grave if he knew his amazing creation had been ruined like this. The human characters were just as bad as their acting. The effects were dire. The camouflage looked like a child had drawn it on screen and the fire effects were even worse. Alan Silvestri's score looked to be the only saving grace until some genius decided to kill it by putting a rock beat through it. Why??? This movie made avpR look like a crowning moment in cinema history!! I honestly cant think of one really decent scene. Any self respecting Predator fan should avoid this movie like it was AIDS. I was genuinely disgusted and angered by this movie. In conclusion: Robert Rodriguez. Keep your franchise reboot scripts to yourself from now on. You should be ashamed of yourself. 20th Century Fox. You should be even more ashamed by giving Rodriguez's script the green light. Please let the Predator franchise die with what scraps of dignity it has left.There's somethin' out there waiting for us....n it ain't no good movie.",Predators
648,tomstults,The best Predator movie yet,10,10 July 2010,"Unlike every other horror movie being remade, this movie is worth seeing. Actually, this movie is not so much a remake but more as a sequel to the first movie. Predators is accurately based off Predator but telling by the plot, there has to be at least a 10 year difference. My favorite thing is that throughout this movie, the characters slowly learn about the Predators based on the events that the characters face. It not just Predators killing humans, but it seems more as a hunt rather than just one Predator killing everyone. Another great aspect of this movie is that the Predators are not unstoppable and that this movie contains new breeds and types of Predators that are involved in this hunt. The casting was well done by that the chosen actors/actresses perfectly fit in with the role that they were playing. I understand how difficult it was for this movie to become successful because the remakes are known to become unsatisfying. Overall, it is a great movie and deserves more credit and it is a perfect ending to the Predators series.",Predators
649,windowsvd,Good but a bit disappointing.,8,10 July 2010,"I thought Predators was pretty good but it wasn't as good as I'd hoped, it isn't as good as the first movie but still way better than those AVP films.The story was good but a bit too predictable, because you can kinda predict who's gonna live and who's gonna die. I thought the acting was pretty good, though I've heard a lot of complaints about the casting like Adrian Brody and Topher Grace, but they were actually pretty good, even though I thought Adrian Brody sounded a bit like Batman. I was disappointed with Laurence Fishburne's character and the classic predator but I wont spoil it.I think this is a movie that a lot action/sci-fi and of course Predator fans will enjoy, so overall, I give the movie an 7.5/10",Predators

Anyway finally after 23 years they made a sequel that was worthy. Action was nonstop the plot was original the only thing that was lacking was my desire to see just straight up Predator on alien. The movie even ties in with the original Predator in a nonchalant kind of way. Good action, good acting and most of all they add something new that I personally didn't see coming. If you love sci-fi/action this is a must see!!!P.S.- I did like Predator 2 but Predators was definitely better in my opinion.",Predators
651,waynebetts69,My ''Predators'' Review (no spoilers),7,11 July 2010,"i was very excited when i heard about this movie several weeks ago, i own every alien, predator and Alien Vs Predator movie and have played several games as well. so i guess you could call me a fan.When first learning of Robert Rodriguez at the helm of this movie i was a little hesitant. he has made some fantastic movie's but i wasn't sure if his style would suit this movie! The basic storyline without giving away anymore than the trailer..A bunch of the fiercest soldier's, criminal's and just general bad-asses are rounded up and literally dropped onto an alien planet, where they must fight to survive against a group of Predator's who plan to hunt the human's down! Now this movie was visually stunning, the special effect's blew me away and really lived up to my expectation's on many level's! beautiful scenery and huge attention to detail in this area! The story had great potential. but i think this is where the movie really lacked! I put it down to the Rodriguez style of focusing too much on the gun's blazing full throttle action with the story really taking a backseat. thus really not letting the actor's tell a story except where occasionally a character will reveal a little of what is happening from similar occurrence's in their lives! but to me this often comes across as a coincidence or even a guess which doesn't help me at all as i want some back story! There are a couple twist's and turn's but really nothing ground breaking or exceptionally memorable. It was more akin to the AVP movies/high octane thrill ride as opposed to the two original predator movie's which had a lot more depth in their story-telling.The movie will have a divided appeal to long time fans of this franchise. some will be confused with many things that just don't make sense in the film. then you'll have your special effects junkie's who will drool at how they have brought the Pred's to life with the modern technology in this installment.But all in all was a rather enjoyable film and i will add it to my DVD collection! Score: 7/10",Predators
652,bassdynamix,Predators didn't do what predators do. HUNT!,6,11 July 2010,"OK Imma be real here! Predators Sucked! Why? Due to the fact the Predators didn't do what predators do. HUNT! In PRED 1 and 2, AVP 1 and 2, You see the preds using all types of weapons and cloaking to take out the prey. In this it was more of a Hey look at my new Pred threads type of thing and not show what they can really do, (""Meant to do, BORN TO DO"".) I almost fell asleep when Laurence Fishburne part came along. Instead of having the character become happy to see humans that he could use as help to fight against the Predators. He winds up being a nut scavenger that wants to kill the humans to take what they have. He had a cloaking device and could have made good use of it in the movie to fight the preds but nooooo. So instead we get more dialogue and sleeper time. Now Danny Trejo! Why didn't they make good use of his killing skills being he was selected by the preds as worthy prey?!?! Instead we get a dead Trejo. His character could have shined a bit before he died. At least die in battle after he was separated by the group as meant to be by the Pred Hounds. OK now for Topher Grace the disgraced doctor. Wtf is this! This guy is selected as prey worthy enough for the hunt and instead we get a nut job that wants to kill the girl because he's also a NUT JOB! Let get real here. (We Humans are on an alien PLANET being hunted and instead of that being something we should be worried about his only concern is to be the mad doctor. WHAT CRAP! Isabelle (Alice Braga), an Israeli military sniper plays her role very well and shows her sniping skills. Royce is great as the American mercenary as he uses his skills. Mombasa (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali), an African death squad member is convincing enough as he shows fear in his eyes and plays the part right. Stans (Walton Goggins), a convicted serial killer is so so comedy relief. Nikolai (Oleg Taktarov), a Russian special forces commando is great with his minigun. Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien), a Yakuza enforcer in my opinion was so so. Oh and he happens to find a traditional samurai sword on a predator hunting planet to fight the preds LOL whats the chances of that happening! At least make it more realistic and have the predators give them weapons hidden within the jungle for them to find. The films score is great being they used the score from predator 1 and 2 which is a smart move ""BUT"" one thing I didn't like is near the end of the movie they added that stupid electric guitar riff to the score which cheapened the music. The original score is a masterpiece and should not be messed with. OUT OF 10 Stars it gets a 6 1/2. The 1/2 is only because I love the Predator character.",Predators
653,williampowen,Very well done adaptation of the first,10,11 July 2010,"I actually have to degree with some of the haters on here. I thought for the amount of time allowed a surprising amount of character development was covered. Compared to the first Predator there was more character development in this one. You really knew nothing about Arnold in the original movie, especially after all the supporting cast died. By the end of this movie you knew something about every character and what they did before they were put on the planet.Not only did this movie deliver on the aspects of what made the old predator great it actually added considerable depth to the series in general.Spoilers---A good way to judge a sci-fi movie is how much content there was to think about and explore after the film has ended. Not only did we gain a new level of how the predators hunt via the game preserve, but we also got a glimpse into the world of the predators themselves through the discovery of a type of civil war going on amongst themselves. Additionally the inclusion of other aliens on the world was a nice touch as well. The only thing I would have hoped for would be the inclusion of a Alien skull amongst the main trophy camp of the predators.",Predators
654,demosthenesd,"Nothing new, cowardly addition",1,12 July 2010,"I am a huge fan of the first Predator, I was a 7 year old kid when I saw it and will always love it.This does not mean I expect every sequel to copy it.So I am cool with Predator 2, they expanded on the story and even dared to make a connection with Alien.AvP has my favorite scene in all of the franchise, the flashback of the ancient times when the Predators were worshiped as gods.AvP2 was a horrible disappointment as I was expecting it to take place in the predator homeworld, but no, due to low budget it takes place in the US. At least it had a bold scene of the Predator homeworld.Predators takes place in a really low budget environment because ""Predator belongs in the jungle""... Why exactly I don't know.This movie is very cheap and tries to steal moments of the first movie to gain value.It's more about the characters than the predators and I really don't care about any of them, except the yakuza hit-man. At least he remakes the Indian's death from Predator 1 with style.This movie should be called Nobodies instead of Predators.There is nothing new about the predators in this film except that there is a new bigger meaner sect of them. Like the old ones failed for some reason or were fully covered and explored.No imagination at all.No budget.",Predators
655,szalko1,A rework of the 1987 classic,6,12 July 2010,"I have seen the movie today and gave myself time to form an opinion about it. The involvement of Robert Rodrigez put the bar quite high which built up a sound hype for this brand new ""hunt"". Fans of the franchise were starving for a decent, strong tale after disappointing attempts a'la AVP 1 and 2. Now as for the movie. The base of the story is great in my opinion. Collect the most ruthless killers on Earth and hunt them down systematically. Predators always had a need for some challenging hunts, now they get what they want (at least on paper). I think casting is very well done, especially Adrien Brody as the lead. The thing I liked the best about the movie was his performance. A lot of critics and people cried that he isn't built to pull of an action role, but I think he is just as convincing as Arnold, if not more. Great to see him in a role like this. Others also did their job well. My favorite was Hanzo, I wish he got more screen time. The idea and design of these ""new"" Predators is fine. Refreshing and brutal at the same time, I was really pleased with the way they looked. I felt like the dogs and falcons were a bit underused, though I understand that they didn't want to make it too cheesy, which is indeed a good thing. Now the negative...watching this movie made me feel like Rodrigez and Nimród didn't want to take too much risk. The whole movie just resembles too much of the original, which is good of course, but at the same time I had the feeling that it lacked originality and creativity. Stuff like the tropical jungle, the team, the waterfalls, the staring at ""something"" in the woods, the ""over here"" phrase, the last fight with the mud on Brody....and I could go on and on and on for a day. It just gives you a feeling that Robert and Antal wanted to pull of a sure thing , basically recreating the original cult classic with some additional touches. Don't get me wrong, Predators is a good action flick, but come on, it's Robert Rodrigez we are dealing with and I am sure people including me expected a little more experimenting and creativity. I just feel like they wanted to ""satisfy"" the fan boys too hard...the whole movie feels like a tribute to the original. It is obvious that when you have a working formula, you don't want to mess it up, but come on man, it's way too similar to the first one, not mentioning the numerous clichés it has. Oh and one more thing. I read a lot about how well the story is told and characters are developed. Perhaps it's just me, but it is as shallow and fast as possible. They are dropped on the planet, quickly befriend each other and figure out the whole situation in a blink of an eye. It felt really fast for me, but we can understand that they wanted to preserve time for the action, which IMO could have been a little more.All in all, Predators is a decent scifi actioner, which uses a little too much of the original movie to secure success. I am sure Rodrigez and Nimród could have pulled of a more genuine tale, but after the failures of AVPs, it is understandable they went with the sure thing.",Predators
656,danderson688,Enough to hold me off until the next installment,7,14 July 2010,"I am an avid Predator series fan. I can't recall how many times I've watched Pred 1 and Pred 2, and I'm only 20. Thank God my dad introduced me to the predator. That being said, I went into the midnight showing with very high expectations. I felt that, after 20 years since P2, there would be enough content to make a movie at least remotely close to as good as Predator 1. Because of said high expectations, I found myself a little disappointed after the movie ended. I sat there in the theater, honestly not wanting to believe the movie was over yet. I'm not claiming the movie was bad, just not what I hoped that it would be. Some of the action scenes felt just a little forced and out of place, and I think there needed to be more character development. I did enjoy it though, for what it is. It IS a Predator movie (FINALLY), I had the chance to see my favorite baddie back on the screen, and watch it do what it does best. It had a good few, ""OHHHH, S#%T!"" moments, and scenes where I felt the suspense and horror of the creature came back, but just not nearly enough for me. Above all though, I appreciate what Nimrod Antal and Robert Rodriguez have tried to, and more or less, successfully completed in doing, and that is get the Predator franchise back on the right track.

The casting was pretty lame none of them really stood out and the main character quickly developed a batman voice i was praying for him to get killed first but i knew it was never gonna happen. laurence fishburne probably the best actor there, well you only get to see about five minutes of him. This film had OK moments but its far from the original what made it worse i think is that they maybe tried to copy the original too much, they were direct quotes and similar scenes from the original film this just didn't work. at the end of the film i was expecting something Else to happen but no, it really did feel like an unfinished film..",Predators
658,lthlpsi,Yet ANOTHER disappointment!!,1,14 July 2010,"I don't know how this movie can get anything over a 5. Either the people who are writing the reviews are 12, or they really have no clue what a good movie is.When have the standards gotten so low for movies?? I read reviews about this movie that said it is ""good"" because they did not ""expect much"", or because it was ""better than the other sequels.""(Which are btw some of the worst movies I have ever seen) A movie should be rated on whether it is GOOD or NOT.This movie is NOT good. The story could have been interesting but it failed, miserably. Some gripes that come to mind are:-As others have mentioned, why would highly intelligent aliens abduct killers just to hunt them? Obviously if they can abduct them, what's the sense of hunting them? -Why does Adrian Brody sound like batman? -How does Adrian Brody and the rest of the cast figure everything out about the Predators and Planet?-As soon as you meet the complete 8 Strangers, you know right off the bat Adrian Brody and the chick will be the only to survive. Obvious as day.-Why do these highly advanced Predators need ""dogs"" to hunt & track the humans? Again we are talking about a highly advanced species.-In the Original Predator, the Predator stalked and hunted a complete elite military force and killed them all but Arnold. How is it in this version that 3 bigger and badder species of Predators get killed much easier, by random ""killers"" at that, and on their own ""hunting grounds""? Seriously?-In the Original Predator you actually sympathized for the cast, because the movie was actually built up properly. In this version I could careless who lived. Matter of fact I was hoping none of them survived.-The Yakuza character manages to wear his full suit throughout the whole movie without breaking a sweat and still looking perfectly clean. Mind you he is running through a jungle, getting chased by Predators, alien dogs, dodging bullets, yet he is still in his suit all throughout.-I agree with another reviewer, how the hell did the one Soldier built such an elaborate trap with no tools. Not even McGyver was so handy.-When they realize they aren't on earth, it barely seems to bother any of them. You would expect someone to either freak out, or think they are going insane. Not here.-Laurence Fishbourne has managed to use the Predator's Cloaking technology, yet nobody seems to care or mention using it as potential tool to fight the Predators. Laurence Fishbourne might as well of just been wearing regular clothes..-The Psycho Killer, no idea what that had to do with the movie. Another Hollywood twist.I could go on and on and on...I feel like this movie was thrown together, with no attention to detail and lacked any originality. Half the movie is a spin off of the original. A horrible one at that. The original Predator is one of the best sci-fi movies. The story, acting, everything about it is excellent. It actually kept you on the edge of your seat, interested in the characters, and sympathizing with Arnold in the last fight scene.Predators did the total opposite. Bottom line if you were expecting a revival of the series like I was, you will be seriously disappointed.",Predators
659,elliottthewlis,Addressing all people who hate this movie.,9,14 July 2010,"After reading several reviews i have to write my own, due to the fact people are complaining about this film. Even worse is they're accepting Predator 2 as a good film... now, THat was crap (but enough about that, i'm here to discuss Predators). I, as a true Predator fan, love it. I especially love the little nods towards the original such as when he says 'C'mon, KILL ME'. Another great scene was the one on one with the Predator and the samurai. That was amazing, and still blows me away. I'll admit the characters did seem like clones of the first one, but the fact they knew nothing about each other makes the relationship between them even more tense, because you never know who you can trust. But with that said, I thought that you could see differences between them, too (the cast of Predator and Predators), because Royce is a much more selfish person, and cares only about himself, where as Dutch is more selfless, like when he says 'my team are not expendable', but their roles in the team are quite the same. But one thing I agree with the people who DON'T like this is the missing scene form the trailer, but my anger is calmed in the FAQ's. All in all, I recommend to all people who thought Predator 2 was awful, and waited all those years for a new one. this should quench your thirst.",Predators

Predators promised a revisit to the original formula which made Arnie's encounter so watchable back in the day. In short though, it failed. The dialogue is pathetic and I know the original was not exactly Shakespeare but come on. The pacing of the movie is lame too. It never builds any tension or sets the viewer's adrenalin rushing but instead feels like a series of tired set-pieces mashed together. The characters are not a patch on Dutch, Mac, Dillon etc and you really find yourself not caring whether they die or not. Laurence Fishbourne's character 'Noland' is under used too unfortunately. I loved Predator and thought Predator 2 was OK(ish) but this latest incarnation was a real let down. It's a shame really as it feels like a real missed opportunity.

It was nice to see the Predator back in the jungle where it belongs; the Graphics were great and just enough so it was cool but not cheesy. When I first was looking into the movie 2 weeks before it came out I had my doubts about Adrien Brody as the lead, I've never really viewed him as a tough military kind of actor but he did great as the lead role Royce the only better choice would have been Arnold himself, I also thought Topher Grace did great he was the perfect comic relief.

I'm getting a bit worn out with all the remakes and lack of original idea movies from Hollywood. But, I actually enjoyed this one...was a wild ride. I loved the ""Wolf"" predator, what a bad ass. This one had a very original and interesting beginning and a pretty good cast. Picking the best of the best, or worst in some cases, for the Predators to use as game, although not a new idea, I think worked here. I've seen complaints about character development, but think we did not need a lot for what was going on. The backgrounds given were adequate for what was going on.I am not used to seeing Topher Grace, whom I adore, in a role like this, but he did it very well. Michelle Rodriquez is always a person I enjoy watching, she is one kick-ass actor. They all did a great job, I think. Yes, there where plot holes and I too wondered why they did not utilize the cloaking helmet that Laurence Fishburn's character had....but, all in all, it was a fun/wild ride.

Predator 2 - change the regular jungle with a concrete jungle and add some human brain to it with our limited technology and you got yourself a game, a very descent ending too.Predators: I watched an interview with the people who made this movie, one said that they did not intend to measure up against the first movie and Arnold Schwarzenegger and so they decided to do something ""original"" but still stay true to the origin, so lets see... -Humans captured and brought to another planet, handpicked from the most dangerous ones around - pass -A survivor for 10 seasons managing to kill 2 or more of the meanest hunters around acting as he did trying to kill the others with such a miserable attempt, why did he bother helping them and not just killing them and taking their stuff? It was perfectly doable as he was good enough to be present at the predators camp without being noticed - epic fail-A hunter....splattering the prey he/they were hunting for 10 seasons without success in 1 fast shot....just who in the world thought this up? That's one of the biggest fails in the movie, they took the FBI most wanted dude's head as a trophy for a single knife stab and a mean face, they played around with almost every other victim and going as far as to drag 2 of the characters and dropping them into a pit - epic fail.-The Japanese guy finding a katana and doing the exact same thing that one of the soldiers in the first movie did, OK I could believe this to be possible if he was close to the other people as it was in the first part (comrades in arms) but come on, they were all strangers, that guy is a yakuza, he got 2 fingers cut cause he talked too much - epic fail on that character's role. All others that will watch it after me will probably notice stuff like 1 scene missing from the movie, there was a trailer where the main dude has about 11 or so lazers pointed at him which made my blood pump for a moment there, that's part of why I wanted to go see this movie, well tough luck they removed that scene and whatever plot was twisted around this.You'll see a ridiculous fight between the yakuza and a predator, they didn't show the showdown in the first part between (billie) the soldier with the machete and the predator for the same reason you will see on screen - the fight looked idiotic, we're not aliens so we cannot imagine how they would fight, that's why it seems more comedic than interesting to see a fight happen, and what do you know, both fighters dead - original...not!I ain't even gonna mention the rest of the stuff it truly is horrible, believe me when I say that if you enjoyed the other 2 movies you will be disappointed, for those who haven't watched anything like this then by all means give it a shot, I've watched a lot of movies so I am familiar with most clichés around and this movie has a lot of them. There are many more mistakes I can name but I will probably run out of space and by now I believe I made my point as to why I do not like this movie, I gave it a 3 because of the first passing grade I gave for even 1 shred of originality but still I think I'm rating it too high.",Predators

Just don't go in with the expectation that it is going to be better that the first film but to be honest there are very few sequels out there that are. The film did the series justice with a nice amount of action and story. I can't say the story was all that complicated or in depth but it was entertaining. When I went to the film I had zero expectations. I was hoping to see some decent action shots and some horrible acting. I was was actually surprised the acting wasn't that bad, one that surprised me to see was Adrian Brody. He did a fairly well job at play a tough guy. I wish that his character was a little more developed in the film but all an all he did an outstanding job. So, if you go see this film look at it as a different spin on a old classic but for once you can see what is going on verses all of the action being blocked out by scenes done in the dark.",Predators

I mean c'mon, we are talking about advanced alien hunters here, the smaller one of the Predators almost looked human and also when he fought the Asian guy. The predators should be tall, scary and bulky not average and lean. I got three words: weapons, fights & FX. 3) I understand they wanted a little resemblance to the original but c'mon enough with the re-makes already.You people are ruining good movies, stop the half-fast job and if you are gonna make a re-make make sure is gonna be a super hit, nothing short of that. Mr. Brody( Royce in the movie) is not even close to represent Arlnold on the first one but yet you have him cover in mud and yelling ""c'mon"" im right here, kill me"" like Arnold did on the first one. Arnold probably weights 150 pounds more than the guy, if not more. So, no, NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL. The only prop i will give was the fight between the Asian guy and the predator, representing when Billy stopped at the single-person bridge to fight the predator. That was decent. Overall the movie DID NOT represent the Predator theme: COOL W-E-A-P-O-N-S AND AN IMPRESSIVE P-R-E-D-A-T-O-R.",Predators
668,Vadelm4,Expected more,5,23 July 2010,"So, here is my ""quick"" review, doesn't include direct spoilers, but I'll still put a warning.What I personally expected, was lots of gun fire, predators trying to decapitate people, mysterious, twisted storyline and some kind of a ""WOW!"" feeling. Well, at the first 20 minutes nothing really happens in the movie, I thought there would imaginative story telling or something like that, but no. So then I thought that there would be lots of action to cover poor storyline. There were some good action parts, but they ended too obviously. There were moments when I thought ""Ok, maybe now its getting better!"". Then i realized that the movie was over.The plot was crystal clear from beginning to the end. Not really any twists... About 2 minutes after the movie started you could see who made it to the end of the movie.This is nothing compared to the first Predator. I was expecting more, much more from this movie.I gave this movie 5/10, because it didn't have the Predator feeling in to it. There were some good parts, but nothing to be exited about.",Predators

All the people that claim this have obviously never seen a Brody movie. The Pianist, The Jacket. Not only is his acting fine, he's not even remotely voice acting.2 Weak Character development compared to the original: Not completely false but still exaggerated. Go back and watch Predator, all Arnie and his buddies did was talk in the helicopter on they way in. THAT'S IT! amazing character development! Despite this fact, the original was still a blockbuster and widely popular.3 The Predators are lovey dovey and not violent enough. Completely False.

Sorry but CG was waste of money. And the Yakuza guy was so EXTRA- especially in his final scene where he fought with Predator, and like they both mutually understood a Samurai fight?! huh? I don't think so... I also felt like this movie just showed climax all at once in the ending. Maybe this wasn't something a girl like me should have watched, but generally I just finished watching it feeling sick in the tummy from disappointment about how storyline was non-existent (they just made it up along the way) and how the fighting scenes just was crappy violence.

Now Predators was fantastic, I either thought this was going to be lousy or great. I saw this movie the first day it came out, then saw it again a week later, and it was awesome. I didn't think Adrien Brody would pull it off, but I was wrong, he did an excellent job. Now this movie compared to Predator was just about equal (it is definitely arguable). I say this because the two movies had different styles. In Predator the characters were all tough guys who say all these clichés. Now in Predators the characters were a little different, like I said they were intelligent, and intense. In this movie you really feel like you are in the movie. The setting was amazing and the soundtrack was fantastic. Now this movie truly is the best movie of 2010.

It's all wrong... it lacks depth, mystery, suspense, good acting (for the most part). Characters don't have any charisma at all; the predators look like amateur hunters. The new predators (were those females?) are ridiculous. The story is awful written and from a psychological point of view nothing makes sense because there is no way the characters would behave like that in real life. I mean, the characters fall out of the sky without knowing what happened, then they get hunted down by alien dogs, then by the predators, then they find out they are in a alien planet and it's like they are not even surprised!?...

It makes the creatures more believable. One thing I wish had been done better was the pacing. The beginning of the movie lagged. I also didn't see reason plot-wise to call this movie a sequel to the original or any of the Predator movies really.

683,user-719-297109,Sooooo much wrong with this film... where to begin....,1,22 June 2013,"Just finished watching the 2010 attempt of continuing a franchise that, like the predator itself, refuses to die. Although the films plot made about as much sense as a hamster in a cardboard t-shirt, it was actually fairly entertaining. Unfortunately this was about all it was good for. Let me highlight some of its problems... It begins with Adrien Brody falling through the air, his parachute finally manages to deploy with about 50 metres before he hits the ground - he would die - FACT! The movie would end one minute in, or best chance scenario he lives but every single one of his bones is now sticking out of his flesh. But no... after brushing himself down he is good to go. Because i don't have all day I'll skip a lot of it and move on to the next thing that tickled me. The group that dropped from the sky are attacked by the predators, and after a lot of firing and i mean A LOT of it, they realise that someone is missing. It says a lot about the character's dynamic when you cant even remember who is missing 30 minutes into the film, after 5 minutes they find him, turns out it was Danny Trejo, not exactly an unknown actor! The predators then systematically kill off an array of racial stereotypes, a Mexican, an African, a Chinese fellow, to leave all white people remaining. Im boring myself having to relive this film so il bullet point: Turns out they have been taken to a different solar system all together, no amount of writing will explain this.The girl in the group has heard/seen one before and knows that our friend Arnie beat it by covering himself in mud to prevent their infra red. After hearing this crucial bit of information guess who covers themselves in mud? that's right no one!! The group stumbles across none other than Morpheus from the Matrix who explains that the predators are learning from every kill in order to perfect their predator instincts. I mention this because they don't learn jack. The oldest trick in the book when being beaten s**tless from a predator is to pretend to be dead on your front and when they turn you over show them the grenade pins in your hands and blow them to smithereens. Not only do they fall for this trick, but it happens twice!! i mean there's only three predators! three deaths! how hard is it to be a bit more original and inventive! Arnie crushed one in between two gigantic logs for Christ sake.Morpheus being black (as mentioned before not fitting the racial stereotype) is killed off.What got me the most is the Predators have the ability of invisibility, superior weaponry, and ability of infra red, heightened hearing and smell. Of all of these i'll highlight just one: INVISIBILITY!!! i mean come on! how bad of a predator do you have to be if you cant kill someone that cant see you a foot away! The big twist at the end, a double cross from the character we least expected, none other than That 70's Show star Topher Grace, apparently hes been working with the predators from day one and there is absolutely no explanation of this what some ever, it doesn't effect the plot in the slightest.Finishing on a rather tragic note, being trapped on a planet that for intents and purposes is just a giant killing ground, the two remaining characters are stranded, witnessing everything repeat itself as new parachutes fall from the sky. This scene is supported with appropriately dark, ominous and foreboding music. As it cuts to the credits the music changes to the most upbeat 1950's Little Richie rock'n'roll song I think i've ever heard, the only explanation being the film is over every one rejoice!",Predators
684,jordan-white1414,Predators: A quick review,8,19 March 2014,"Predators is a great movie that can be enjoyed by both sci-fi fans and people unfamiliar with the genre. The setting, cast, special effects and soundtrack bring new aspects to the Predator films while maintaining the same feel that the previous ones had. The jungle setting brings a certain feeling of nostalgia to someone that has seen the first predator film when watching this new installment. This film deviates from the others through alien environments and creatures not seen before in the predator films. The new predators look realistic and convincing, their armor and weapons are more detailed and give them a more intimidating look than it did in the other movies. The predators camouflage abilities look much more transparent and effective. The soundtrack has a likeness to the other predator movies in a way that brings you back to the roots of the series. It is subtle enough to not give away what is going to happen and is used flawlessly to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. Adrien Brody (Royce) actually did a surprisingly great job in bringing his role into the series. Adrien brought his own lone wolf like characteristics into the character he played and was a very convincing mercenary. Alice Braga (Isabelle) is an amazing lead female role in this movie. Also, Topher Grace brings some unexpected additions to the film as Edwin the doctor. The special effects, costumes and editing came an extremely long way from the first two movies. The cast does a great job of bringing the characters to life and making the film more entertaining. The sound track and feel of the movie is still consistent with the others and the setting of the movie could not have been better. Overall, Predators is a great film and is definitely worth watching.",Predators
685,krause-7,My Review,1,30 September 2010,"Script writing has degenerated to such a degree in Hollywood that plots are no longer necessary. The original predator involved a jungle showdown between an alien from outer space and gun wielding folks as end state, right? Well the entire premise of Predators is predicated on an absurd deus ex machina: rather than go through the effort of establishing a reason for the cast, setting and plot to exist, the cast is virtually teleported into a jungle with predators immediately and without explanation. I am not arguing that action movies should be Shakespeare, but Predator had a number of interesting and compelling plot points: the supposedly missing cabinet minister, a CIA cover-up, false flag operations, the whole subplot involving the rebels (clearly modeled to reflect US relations in South America during the 19870s and 80s) and a general climate of military realism. Even the reason why the cast of the original Predator has to trek through the jungle rather than be magically saved by a helicopter pick up makes sound sense: the first chopper sent in was shot down by a heat seeking missile, and the LZ is too hot. They can't make subsequent contact with friendly forces because as we might recall command has established a small window by which to talk to the special forces team in order to avoid interdiction by potentially listening enemy forces. This makes sense from a military perspective, and grants the film a plausible reasoning for throwing the cast into a horror/sci fi scenario.In Predators, there is 0 exposition. The cast is literally thrown into the jungle with only the flimsiest of implied explanations. The cast of characters find themselves parachuting from the sky, apparently not knowing how or where they got there. As there is no connection between the characters whatsoever, or a reason for the plot existing, the film comes off of as a sort of fanboy's eroticism and an exercise in violence masturbation – a ""plot"" so simple that it cannot rightly be called a plot and might as well been cooked up by a 12 year old kid having a daydream....The rest available at: http://www.krauselabs.net/?p=1168",Predators
686,bateau-7,"Not as good as the first nor as good as all the hype suggests. However, a solid film and better than the 'AVP' films and 'Predator 2'.",6,9 July 2010,"I am surprised about all the rave reviews this film is receiving. It is okay, but it is not a 7.9 out of 10 movie. It is more like 6 out of 10.I liked the acting and characterisation. Laurence Fishburne was the exception unfortunately - a bit too weird, unnecessary and he should have been used differently. Adrien Brody, Alice Braga and Topher Grace stand out for me. The other cast were also good. I would have preferred Danny Trejo's character to have lasted longer and Hanzo was underused. It was a relief to have some good characters and acting in this film, which the 'AVP' films and 'Predator 2' did not have unfortunately. The special effects were also good.The story was reasonable. However, it was too similar to 'Predator' and the similarities reminded me that this film was nowhere near as good as the original. It lacked the tension and the pace of the original. During the first half of the film, nothing much happened. We got most of the action at the end and even that was too similar to the first movie for my liking. Then you have to think of the whole concept: how many different ways can you portray the same basic idea. In the end they will all be similar, such as the James Bond films.Furthermore, we hardly see the Predators. They were at the end of the film. One thing I did not like though was the portrayal of the 'Classic' Predator. It seems Rodriguez has created his 'own' Predator, which makes the 'Classic' Predator seem obsolete and irrelevant - his choice of course, but 'Classic' Predator should have featured more. Hey, it is a cult classic after all! This new meaner Predator almost harks back to the 'newborn' in 'Alien Resurrection'. It is as if he is introducing this new Predator just to distinguish this film from the rest. I do not believe these new Predators brought anything that the previous Predators did not have. The fight scene between the two was also too quick and just showed that the new Predator is 'better' than the previous version. However, I prefer the 'Classic' Predator, but I know it is only a film. Despite this the new Predators were okay I suppose.Overall, the film was reasonable, better than the 'AVP' series or 'Predator 2'. It fixed the major problems which all the previous films including 'Predator' had: the characters and acting. However, it still lacked that special something that the original had. 6/10",Predators
687,Don-Vinnie,"Finally, another good predator movie",9,8 July 2010,"I really enjoyed this movie. The story and action was excellent, the settings were fantastic, and the acting was great (Adrien Brody plays the tough guy better than i was expecting, and Laurence Fishburne's performance is amazing).One qualm i have had with these 'strangers get dropped into deep s**t' movies in the past (see: cube, dawn of the dead) is the forced characterisation dialogue. ""Let's go round in a circle and say our names and what we do"" comes across as so tacky and unnatural, but in Predators they take the route of cutting out 90% of that fluff. Because of this, you don't learn many of the character's names and detailed backgrounds, technically negatively affecting characterisation but in my opinion it was the right choice. The time they save here is well spent on keeping the flow of the film going, and all of the characters are unique enough that you get a good sense of their personality without the need for forced dialogue.I went into the cinema today pessimistic, but emerged elated. I'm a big fan of the original, and i've been somewhat disappointed with its other sequel and spin-offs - not only does Predators blow them out of the water, but thanks to modern special effects, great settings, writing, and acting, I believe it's even better than Predator.",Predators

The director Nimród Antal did a great success with this movie. The actors were in their character as they supposed to be and they all had a different style to play it. You knew who was the good boy, who was the smart one, who was the evil one, but you never knew who would put in danger all others, just because, yes, like in every action movie their a guy who want to survive alone and want to make all others die. Robert Rodriquez, who had the principal role, made my interest for this movie even bigger. The story resumed is about a commando squad dropped on an unknown planet. The commando itself doesn't know each other's and they try to kill an alien chasing them. I think they all act like they were supposed to do but with a little bit of themselves. The soundtrack was especially intriguing, when some action was happening the soundtrack was excited or dramatic, when it was excited it currently when the commando was doing a good move but when it was dramatic you knew someone would be killed.",Predators

There would have been no need for 2018's The Predator, as this film does an amazing job of expanding the mythology of the Predator series. I've come back to this film many times over the years because it's so satisfying on every level. When I found out that they weren't going to make a sequel for it I was really let down. The weird part is that this film did pretty good at the box office, and wasn't near the bomb that The Predator was. I have no idea why they brought Shane Black in to helm the franchise, as he produced a far inferior product compared to 2010's Predators. The characters in this movie are fully developed and the cast is a great fit together as a unit. It even carried over the Alien/Predator hybrid from the abysmal Alien vs predator Requiem. Shane Black somewhat grifted that idea for his film, but in a way that's not nearly as satisfying. So all in all this stands as the final decent movie from the franchise.",Predators
691,saulpullivan,"Not a terrible concept, HORRIFIC acting on Brody's part!",6,6 November 2020,"I made an account specifically to give a review on this movie. I do not have a lot to say that is negative. I will keep this short, however, Adrien Brody's acting was so bad that it actually may have been good. For someone to be so out of touch on how to 'tough talk' it was boarder line hilarious. It seemed as if anytime Brody was asked a simple question, he would give the absolute cringiest generic answer while attempting to portray a badass. Whomever casted him needs to be removed from their position and never be asked to cast another feature. Although, I must say, the rest of the cast worked out perfectly and really propped up Adrien Brody's lame character. ""You must be Black Ops, maybe a mercenary?"" Brody: "" You got a problem with that?!"" What!!?? She was just asking a question after you literally just assumed everyone else's rank/position. Also, have you ever heard of a black ops specialist/mercenary going on missions with an AA12 shotgun?! I'd ask what planet does any of this make sense, but, clearly it's the alien hunting planet their on. Who knows, maybe in the sequel Eric Foreman and Fez will be the tough guys, because, in a world that makes little to no sense, that would make a lot of sense to someone... All I can say, is, WOW!

My word, my 5 out of 10 grading was generous, and I think that's only because I loved the first Predator film and liked the 2nd one.Right from the outset, the feel was not what it should be... and come on, casting Adrien Brody (he of The Pianist fame) as a double hard elite soldier was never gonna work. OK, so he looks like he's been on a protein shake or two, but he still looks like a school teacher and the deeper voice that he tries doesn't work.To be honest, none of the characters were convincing (perhaps Alice Braga at a push). Hah, old tubby Laurence Fishburne playing a scavenger elite soldier ?...The casting was as bad as the script and the cinematography the icing on the cake. The graphics were plop, with the animals (those that were bullet-proof at one stage, and then dieing by one bullet the next) looking rubbery, and the Predator's blood looking silly.I could go on, but I'm boring myself !. One final point that I'll make, is how can The (cloaked) Predator walk into the middle of the armed soldiers, stick it's sword into one of them and then still survive when everyone's firing at it ?!. Why the Hell would it do that in the first place ???!.As my title states, very disappointing.",Predators

Predator 2 was oke, but not as good as the original. The avp series where medium at best. This film however delivers what fans have been waiting for: a good action horror with a decent story line but above all, lots of predator action. The story builds up at the right speed, there are twists and turns that keeps you puzzling throughout the film. The acting is good enough so you don't get enoid by them, though there are some familiar faces like Topher Grace. It's funny for me to place him from that 70's show to a horror action film but he delivers. Worth mentioning is the music which is identical to the original. That and the jungle atmostpheer gives it the same kind of vibe. Overall, it is a film of which i hope there will be a sequel.

694,abwilson86,A half decent sequel - decades too late,6,14 July 2010,"I like Predator. It's a classic, tense action film that takes a cast The Expendables would kill for and puts them against one of the most iconic aliens of cinema. It was putting this breed of brawny actor, rippling with so much machismo and sweat and having them hacked, ripped and blown away that made the film (for this scrawny geek)most enjoyable. Sadly the sequel only had an ageing Danny Glover and there was never going to be any contest.Predators has a tough act to follow since everyone knows now what to expect. By recreating the jungle and bad-ass team of the original it immediately signals its intent to tread the same path. Okay so this jungle may be on another planet, but this idea is never really exploited. There is a battle with some predator Rottweilers but we're not on Pandora here. The fact that they're on an alien planet serves only to stake home the reality of their situation. There is no way out of here.As for the crew...lets just say if these guys were pitted against Jesse Ventura, Apollo Creed and Arnie, I know who I would root for. But then these are different times. Arnie's crew were simplistic good guys, a rescue crew who looked out for each other. Brodie's guys include the scum of the universe and they are more than happy to stab each other in the back if they knew that would get them out of there. Well, all apart from Isabelle, an elite sniper from the IDF who also happens to be our perspective on this story.That just leaves the star of the show - Predator. But what do you do when the audience knows everything about him? Make him badder. James Cameron gave us the Queen Alien and here the director introduces a new breed of Predator...that looks and behaves pretty much like the old one. There isn't really anything new to see here and this problem is at the heart of the film. It has no new ideas to separate it from the other films. Well save one. That the real monsters here aren't from outer space but from Earth itself and they are led by the worst. A self seeking survivalist loner who has only one aim - to survive. Problem is, he is played by Adrien Brody who, despite his impressively ripped body simply doesn't convince as someone that selfish and hard-hearted. In fact few of the crew act like the monstrous killers they are supposed to be. And this ultimately is what makes the film fail for me. A reboot might have been a better route.",Predators
695,laurengorges,Had potential but didn't execute.,3,12 July 2010,"When I heard that there was a ""predators"" movie coming out i was obviously excited. I wasn't even born when Predator came out but was raised watching it and watching Schwarzenegger movies. So basically I was excited.I'm not sure that I expected too much or just have seen too many movies. I watch all movies no matter the actors, budget, or the director. I didn't read any reviews before I saw the movie, the only thing i had heard was the basic plot (These people are hunters on planet Earth, the predators are the hunters on this planet, lets make a game and see who wins.) Plot sounds kinda boring but it had potential.Overall I could have fallen asleep when I watched this movie. There was no excitement, no special effects and the acting was horrible. Basically the way the movie went was ""oh crap were on this planet with these things. Well i don't want to die so I'll follow the tough guy and when time comes, I'll have someone else stay and die for me. (the last part went until there were only 3 people left.)"" And after carefully reading some of the other reviews, I agree. Comparing the predator in the original to the predators in this movie, these predators look like a older man in a Predator Halloween costume. It was pathetic.Only reason I gave this a three was because of the convict, he at least made a few good laughs in the movie. That was the only show of emotion the movie got from me. I jump easily during creepy or suspenseful parts but i didn't even flinch during this movie. In the end, I would not let someone pay me to waste another 2 hours to watch this movie.",Predators
696,WhysoSalty,A worthy sequel to the original Predator that doesn't treat the viewer like a dimwit...,9,8 July 2010,"This is my first review so bear with me :-)I have just come home from the theater. I will give it 9/10 because it doesn't pretend to be more than it is, and that is a solid action/horror film with a good cast (I love Fishburne as the soldier gone crazy hermit) and it treats me like an intelligent being by NOT over explaining EVERYTHING, it's nice to see it leave certain things unexplained so the viewer can decide for him/herself, what is what with certain things happening throughout the movie.And there is several nice little nods to the original Predator film but not too much (ok maybe a little :-) And, it's NOT watered down when it comes to the gory stuff, but at the same time it's not overdone so it seems silly.I'm overjoyed that the Pred's once again are shown as hunters with a code of conduct, like not killing unarmed prey.And it's really awesome to see a pred going Mano a Mano using only it's blade against the Yakuza guy who is only armed with a Katana, that fight is btw. beautifully made, like it was plucked right out of a Samurai classic :-) That fight is an honorable fight where the 2 combatants respect each other (love the part where the Yakuza salutes the pred with he's sword and the pred returns the gesture by raising he's blade. And I think it was really great that I got the feeling that the Yakuza really had a chance (it's not a David VS Goliath fight).And last but not least, I'm overjoyed that the film managed to surprise me several times, halfway through the film I actually got the feeling that anybody is up for grabs and not just the ""pretty Hollywood faces"".All in all, a great Genre film and a worthy sequel to the 1987 classic, and btw. this doesn't need a sequel, but if they do it anyway I will only go watch it if it's the same team that does it.",Predators
