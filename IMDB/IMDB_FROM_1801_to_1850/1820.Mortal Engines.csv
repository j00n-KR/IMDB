0,Leofwine_draca,"Seen it all before, many times",5,23 January 2020,"Another day, another Hollywood adaptation of a popular young adult novel. This time around it's MORTAL ENGINES, in which a heroine with a designer scar does battle with the boringly evil British ruler of a moving city that travels around decimating and assimilating its enemies. Yep, it's another story that takes heavy-handed swipes at colonialism while eager to put across its 'woke' credentials. However, it's also long-winded and completely mundane, offering CGI augmented action scenes and visuals that have already been done countless times. At this point in time, all of the HUNGER GAMES, DIVERGENT and other young adult offspring feel interchangeable, with no voice or insight of their own, and nothing to make them stand out from the crowd...",Mortal Engines
1,SnoopyStyle,outlandish world,6,15 September 2019,"The long forgotten world was destroyed in sixty minutes by a weapon called Medusa. It's now a post-apocalyptic world where cities are mounted on wheels and devouring each other for the limited remaining resources. London has crossed a land-bridge to raid the dwindling supply of smaller settlements. Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving) is the ruthless leader working on a secret program. His daughter Katherine is innocent. Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan) is a historian trying to hide the salvaged ancient weapon tech. When Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) tries to assassinate Thaddeus, Tom uncovers one of his secrets and gets thrown out of London.I really like the outlandish premise. There is fun craziness. Hester is a great character and played by the compelling Hera Hilmar. On the other hand, Sheehan is playing his usual talkative know-it-all. He's a bit annoying and not the best romantic lead. Quite frankly, it's better to have Sheehan and Ronan Raftery switch roles. Ronan seems more like the boy scout type and would pair better with Hera. Sheehan would give more spice to the pairing with Leila George. It may still be a great movie until the third act turns into a grinding never-ending ending.I would rearrange the final battle entirely. After defeating Shrike, Hester finds the crash drive. Hester and Tom sneak back into London. They reunite with Katherine and the group sneaks into St. Paul's. Thaddeus fires the weapon once which starts to malfunction. Random strikes hit everywhere including London and the small group fights to stop Medusa saving not just the wall but also London itself. It's a tighter ending. It's not as action packed but it's much better to have the group together. Overall, I like this movie. I like the start more and the ending is not so bad. It could definitely be better. For one thing, the world should be deader. There is way too much green plant life. The world should be a desert. It's post-apocalyptic after all.",Mortal Engines
2,Prismark10,Metropocalypse Mess,5,5 February 2019,"Peter Jackson has produced this steampunk fantasy action film. The film has bits off Terminator, Mad Max, Star Wars, Brazil. It makes the film too messy.It gloriously flopped at the box office as it needed a tighter story and a more engaging hero.Set in a post apocalyptic future. The world was ruined in a 60 minutes war.What is left are settlements in wheels. The big one is London, a city on wheels that consumes smaller settlements. Evil Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving) has built a destructive weapon from old technology to breach a wall that protects the non moving population.Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) is a young woman that is determined to stop him, Valentine also killed her mother. Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan) has been banished from London by Valentine when he found out too much and he aids Hester.Visually the film is a spectacle. The story is too choppy, unengaging, silly and inert. The writers of the Lord of the Rings trilogy certainly had an off day.",Mortal Engines
3,claudio_carvalho,Highly Entertaining Post-Apocalyptic Adventure,7,20 February 2019,"In the future, after the Sixty Minute War, the survivors build mobile fortresses and big cities become predator cities attacking small villages or settlements to take their population, supplies, technology and resources.
When London takes a small mining village, a masked young woman called Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) tries to kill their leader Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving) but the young trainee Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan) saves Valentine and chases Hester. She tells to Tom that Valentine killed her mother and escapes through a dumping hole. When Tom reports to Valentine what Hester said, he pushes Tom that falls in the hole off the city. Tom and Hester meets each other and they are forced to team-up to survive and she tells the story of her mother Pandora and Valentine, who killed her. They are rescued by a strange couple and soon they learn that their intention is to sell them as slaves. But they are saved by the warrior Anna Fang (Jihae) and they learn secrets about Pandora´s discover. Soon they find that they need to stop Valentine to save the civilization in Asia led by Shan Guo and protected by the shield wall.""Mortal Engines"" is a highly entertaining post-apocalyptic adventure produced by Peter Jackson. The story and the screenplay are great, with attractive characters and a good villain. The lead couple shows chemistry and there are many unknown actors and actresses. The CGI is excellent in the Terry Gilliam´s ""Brazil"" style. Highly recommended for fans of the genre. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Máquinas Mortais"" (""Mortal Engines"")",Mortal Engines
4,nogodnomasters,Food of the ancients is indestructable,5,21 December 2018,"The opening scene, I was thinking ""Wild Wild West"" meets ""Mad Max."" and later I had to toss in ""Star Wars"" and Monty Python's ""The Crimson Permanent Assurance."" seriously.The script was not tight and I apologize for PLOT SPOILERS. The setting comes about after an Earth crust shift, followed by ""The 60 Minute War"" with quantum energy (whatever that is) and then at some time there was the even less described ""Nomad Wars.""The city of London is on tank tracks and travels slowly across the land devouring other mobile cities in its wake because it can as it robs them of their resources. Valentine (Hugo Weaving) controls the city and has been quietly making a weapon because running them over is not enough.I am not sure what they had in mind making Elrond as Darth Vadar. They had guns, so the sword fighting confused me. This wasn't LOTR. The role of Kate (Leila George) starts off as if she was going to play a major role, and she was simply a spectator...like Ivanka watching her dad destroy the world. Oh yeah, then there was a dead guy whose partial conscientiousness was inside of a killer robot. He was also after Hester (Hera Hilmar) the main female lead. I guess going after a guy with a quantum machine who wants you dead is not enough. Of course the ""Luke, I am your father"" scene made me hurl chunks.They make fun of modern politics with family separation and Twinkies that are still fresh after 1,000 years. Light humor.The film had great scenes, but they simply tried to cram too much into 2 hours.",Mortal Engines
5,kosmasp,Part 1 - and ... end,7,30 January 2021,"I have not read the books this is based on. So I can't compare this and say what is in it and what is missing or how it deals with issues in the book and how it translates on screen. Having said all that, yes this is predictable! Like many other Science Fiction meets Fantasy movies of its kind, you can see where this is going (or driving if you will). It still does not take too much away from the fun you can have with this.The acting is solid and more importantly: it does look good (CGI and all that). With Peter Jackson attached to it you might have expected that though I reckon. Unfortunately this likely will remain the only entry into the film world, since it really tanked at the box office. Well as it is, that leaves everyone quite ... without any real satisfaction! Maybe it will inspire some to pick up the books though and read them to at least get some closure, since it's unlikely we'll get that on the (big) screen",Mortal Engines
6,BA_Harrison,London Crawling.,8,1 February 2019,"Coming from producer Peter Jackson, king of the overblown, CGI-crammed fantasy spectacle, I fully expected Mortal Engines to be a vacuous waste of two hours, amazing to look at perhaps but bereft of substance, character development, and plot. I was surprised, therefore, by how much I enjoyed this expensive slice of steampunk action, which delivered characters I actually cared about, lots of slam-bang set pieces, an engaging story and, as expected, tons of sumptuous visuals. Yes, there were a few moments where plausibility is stretched a little too far, but I was thoroughly entertained throughout.The film is set on Earth in the future, after war has ravaged the planet. Icelandic beauty Hera Hilmar plays Hester Shaw, a wilful young woman who seeks revenge on Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), the man who murdered her mother when she was a child. Valentine is now in command of London, a massive city on wheels that consumes smaller settlements, and he has his sights set on the land beyond a massive barrier called the Shield, home to the anti-tractionists (those who don't live in moving cities). To destroy the wall, Valentine has constructed a powerful weapon from old technology; it is up to Hester and London outcast Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan) to try and foil his plot. Meanwhile, a Terminator style cyborg, Shrike (Stephen Lang) is hunting Hester, miffed at the fact the she has broken a promise to him.With lots of impressive action, enhanced by breathtakingly detailed CGI, Mortal Engines is vibrant, energetic and exciting - a little too over-the-top at times, but not distractingly so. Hilmar is the big surprise here: she puts in a strong performance and deserves to have a bright future ahead of her - I hope that this film's inexplicable failure at the box office hasn't hurt her career prospects too much.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",Mortal Engines
7,CinemaSerf,"Way too much focus on the look, nowhere near enough on the substance.",6,26 November 2020,"From the team that brought us everything from Middle Earth comes this great to look at, but highly derivative fantasy adventure that regurgitates a hybrid of stories and spits them out pretty unremarkably. To be fair, there is charisma between the two leads - both attractive, young, and ballsy - Hera Hilmar (""Hester)' and Robert Sheehan (""Tom"") as they try to thwart the maniacal ambitions of ""Thaddeus Valentine"" (a suitably dramatic, ""Elrond"" like, Hugo Weaving) who is charged with providing an uninterruptible power source for the marauding mechanical city of London. The visual effects are super, as you might expect, and the score certainly has something of the Howard Shore about it, but the relentlessness of the out of the frying pan into the fire scenarios against impossible odds just recycle themselves once too often and the ending, though impressive to appreciate creatively, has all the jeopardy of night following day. Money has clearly been spent on this, but not on the script nor the plot. It's fine, but nothing more...",Mortal Engines
8,oscaralbert,THE MUMMY and THE WOLFMAN seem downright puny . . .,7,18 December 2018,". . . when compared to Universal Film Studio's latest addition to its famed pantheon of monsters: London. Hollywood's official House of Horror uses MORTAL ENGINES to alert our World to its resurgent British Threat. London always has been synonymous with England, a region now Hell-bent upon upsetting the Planet's apple-cart with its so-called ""Brexit Attack."" Labeled a ""Quantum Energy Tool"" (aka, QE2) throughout MORTAL ENGINES, London's ""Nuclear Option"" is launched against the European Union as this story draws to its climax. The character ""Dr. Twix"" personifies the Real Life villainess at the Brexit controls, ""T. May."" QE2 herself is portrayed with somewhat gender-blind casting as the ""resurrected"" Lazarus model zombie robot ""Shrike"" (a virtual deal ringer for ""Her Royal Highness"" as a Bicentennial Woman). Historically, London has housed all the Arch Villains who plotted the creation of the rapacious ""British Empire,"" symbolized in the opening scene of MORTAL ENGINES by the monstrous steam punk London beast over-running and then chain-sawing the small Germanic salt-mining town, erasing their centuries-old Culture forever. Some scary stuff indeed.",Mortal Engines
9,neil-476,"Disappointing. Looks good, but who cares?",6,23 September 2021,"After apocalyptic war, the wastelands are inhabited by wheeled cities which roam around, eking a living. London is the biggest, and most predatory. Thaddeus Valentine is minded to create a vicious weapon in order to destroy a wall which prevents the cities from venturing into fresh territory. And young Hester Shaw is minded to kill Thaddeus Valentine.December 2018 saw a rush of movies aimed at the geek market. A great trailer sold this one to my inner geek - predatory cities on wheels! Wow! This should be great!It isn't. Every time I think about it, I find more wrong with it. Let's start with the basic idea. The sci-fi nut in me loves the idea, until even a little bit of thought tells me that the notion of cities on caterpillar tracks is hugely impractical. Where does the fuel come from?The story - essentially the battle for Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back - is OK. Hugo Weaving as Valentine, and Stephen Lang as reanimated corpse/robot Shrike, are both fine. But the juvenile leads have little charisma, and it's difficult to care about them.This isn't helped by the script. The Lord Of The Rings trio of Jackson/Boyens/Walsh have turned out a script which pays lip service to Hester's backstory, but the other characters? So what?The visuals of the cities are good, albeit the early high speed chase - well executed - was unconvincing. I simply didn't believe that wheeled cities could travel at those speeds, with such good cornering.And it is dark, not to mention drab. The colour scheme is almost entirely variations on brown, with the exception of one red aircraft.There are a number of points where time is critical, yet people stand around for no particular reason, In one instance, they are on a burning deflating balloon city. You might think that might make them act with a little urgency, but no.This could have been a film I loved - I wanted it to be, I expected it to be. But no. It was, instead, hugely annoying and frustrating.",Mortal Engines
10,bombersflyup,A bit of a mixed bag of quality and cringe.,6,12 February 2019,"Mortal Engines rose to a level better than I had expected, unfortunately it overstays its welcome.A creative premise, with excellent visuals. All the characters good, except the Anna Fang who's bloody awful and pretty much destroys the film. The highlight's the story of Shrike and Hester, out of nowhere it took the film to a different plane of existence.",Mortal Engines
11,trashgang,effects are the best thing,6,6 August 2019,"I was warned when this flick left the theatres after a week or two that something must be wrong. So finally on a plane it was time to watch it, ideal clocking in over two hours.So far so good but what did I just watched? A flick without explaining how the mortal engines became to exist. We do know that things went wrong in the past but that is it.The effects are really top notch. The rolling cities are great and sad to say, the green-eyed robot is the best thing throughout the flick. A bit of a fail due the lack of characters and a good story.If you have a rainy afternoon you could easily watch it with your teens. Enough said, just above mediocre

12,deloudelouvain,An original story with great CGI's.,7,10 February 2019,"When I watch a fantasy science fiction like Mortal Engines I just want to relax and be entertained and that's exactly what I got so I'm not the one who's going to complain. Just don't over analyze everything and enjoy the ride. The story is original, you have to have alot of fantasy to come up with that kind of story. With the constant action it's not even possible to get bored. The acting isn't bad at all, just what I expected from a movie like this one. The best parts are the CGI's. Those are stunning and you get alot of those as the whole movie is basically just about that. There are some moments it looked a bit fake but overall it was just a visual fest. If they would make a sequel I would be the first to watch it.",Mortal Engines

As long as you suspend your disbelief, the movie can be a lot of fun. It's enjoyable, visually interesting and utterly forgettable afterwards.

16,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"I mean, it looks nice, I guess...",4,16 December 2018,"'Mortal Engines (2018)' certainly looks the part, with its mostly CG world rendered relatively realistically and its green-screen-shot actors implemented almost seamlessly, but that's about it, to be honest. The feature is, in general, just so mediocre that it's ultimately incredibly difficult to like, much less recommend. There's little other than the screenplay at fault, since it's pretty much always the story side of things that drag the experience down. I can't stress how comparatively good the movie is visually, though. It's of a grand-scale, with many moving parts, and it almost makes its ridiculous central conceit look cool. The rest of the feature feels hollow, however, and is never really entertaining. While they're perhaps less pervasive than the overall underwhelming sense of simple adequacy, the few more notably cringeworthy or overly cliché moments are stand-out enough to be the only really memorable things about the piece, something that certainly doesn't bode well for its lasting impact or show any signs that the immediate feelings of indifference you get might go away upon retrospection, except if you forget about the entire affair altogether. Also, (and this is a very minor spoiler, I guess) the minions, yes those minions, somehow manage make a brief cameo. 4/10",Mortal Engines
17,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews....,5,12 March 2019,"Mortal EnginesThe best thing about living in a steam-punk environment is that your clothes are always wrinkle-free.However, the engines employed in this sci-fi fantasy are used for more than pressing trousers.After a great war, humanity lives in massive metropolises that absorb smaller outposts into their steam-powered framework. But when London consumes a mining town, it brings aboard a masked interloper, Hester (Hera Hilmar), who wants revenge on the man who killed her mother (Hugo Weaving). Luckily, she has help from a local (Robert Sheehan) and a cyborg veteran (Stephen Lang).While the world building is a wonder to behold, the end result of this YA novel adaptation is not as breathtaking as the scenery. With lackluster performances, this perfunctory tale of revenge plays out pretty much as one would expect.Furthermore, in a world run by engines, your city is going to be in the mechanic's shop a lot.

18,851222,A Colossal Train-wreck,4,26 March 2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.Last week i saw some video on YouTube were some movie critics were making an analysis of why did ""Mortal Engines"" (2018) flopped so hard with box office. Main reasons they said were bad marketing and overcrowded movie market upon which ""Mortal Engines"" was released. Now after finally seeing this movie i can safety say that not a bad marketing nor overcrowded movie market were issues. The main issue is a very simple one - this movie is a complete train-wreck on its own.""Mortal Engines"" has absolute zero of any possible character development. The main hero in this movie has some flashbacks, but even for her i did not care for a second. Other had zero personality, even the great Hugo Weaving who gave the best possible performance in this movie. Now the main hero, actress Hera Hilmar is another topic. I'm not a hater, believe me, but when i first time saw Jennifer Lawrence in ""The Hunger Games"" - her first big movie, i saw a hunger in actresses eyes - you knew you are watching a star making performance who could simply carry the movie on her own. Now take a look at Hera Hilmar - never heard of her before and from what i saw - i will never will. She had zero screen presence, zero personality, zero charisma. Who in the world casted her as a lead of the movie with this big budget heavy concept made a huge mistake. Other crucial part that this movie was barely watchable is a terrible storytelling. While the story itself is good it was told unfortunately in the most uninvolving imaginable way. Screenplay is the one the blamed here. And hiring Christian Rivers - who never even made a movie before was another leap of faith Peter Jackson made. One bad decision after another came from a movie creator this talented and experienced as Peter Jackson.Overall, ""Mortal Engines"" is a colossal disaster in almost every possible way. I really wanted to like this movie, but it wasn't possible to even admire it at the end because its so bad, that i kinda felt bad for people who lost their money creating this mess and ones who bought tickets to see it. A Colossal Train-wreck.",Mortal Engines
19,The-Sarkologist,Deserves a viewing,6,25 December 2018,"Okay, I'm not sure if I can compare this film with Star Wars, but honestly, any film where the grand finale has this huge weapon moving towards a 'rebel base' and the heroes have a time limit to stop it, then I simply cannot help but think at it is basically a clone of that particular film. Then again, considering that there are so many films out there that are basically clones of so many films out there, watching a film that reminds me of Star Wars shouldn't really be all that bad.
Anyway, I'm a little surprised that this film wasn't liked all that much. In fact, I believe that it ended up flopping. Then again, considering that I watched this film a couple of days after watching Bumblebee, I guess the base from which I was coming off was pretty low. The other thing was that this was technically a 'Peter Jackson' film, so I guess I also had a bit more of an expectation with regards to it.
Then again, considering that it was a film about cities on wheels, roaring around the world gobbling up smaller cities, a part of me felt that it might be a little silly. Well, in a way it was, especially since the bad guy, or at least the evil empire, happened to be London. Apparently, the world had been destroyed by an apocalyptical war, and out of the ashes came a bunch of cities on wheels. Well, that is the background, because the movie is about this woman who is hunting down the murderer of her mother. Sure enough, she lands up in London, and confronts the man, who throws her off the city. Well, there is another guy who witnesses it, and he gets thrown off as well. So, the movie then goes into their adventure in attempting to get back on board. It also turns out that this particular guy is also up to no good, because he is collecting ancient technology to create a super weapon. See how the Star Wars connection occurs.
Yeah, I actually didn't mind the film. Some have suggested that the characters were pretty shallow, but the scenery was pretty good, especially since it was one of those post apocalyptic films with a very steam-punk setting. In fact, it was somewhat better than a lot of the other post-apocalyptic style films that have been popping up everywhere, especially where they are dystopian, and involve young adults. Sure, this film probably falls into that category, but honestly, it was much better than some of the others that I have seen. Well, to an extent because wandering around a world where the land is scoured by huge tank tracks was also a little annoying.
However, all in all, I didn't mind this film at all. It was fun, enjoyable, though I probably wouldn't go as far as suggesting that it was great.",Mortal Engines

It's a bit clunky with plot holes but the final submission is well worth it especially visually and the concept is great!

This is his feature film debut. This very ambitious project has striking visuals and the film plays like a live action video game. It is filled with action and adventure and great sets, with incredible CGI.The film suffers from a lot of 'in the right place at the right time' cliches, though. Just like 'Jupiter Ascending', this was maybe too fantastical for the audience to grasp, and sadly, this film became the biggest box office bomb of 2018.

22,cruise01,"An action packed apocalyptic story that has plenty of intense chases, visual effects, and an epic plot.",10,15 December 2018,"Mortal Engines (5 out of 5 stars).Mortal Engines is an awesome post apocalyptic adventure film that is action packed, visually stunning, and an epic. Probably one of the better young adult novel adaptations into a movie. From the producers and writers with Peter Jackson and his writing partners taking the adaptation into his own hands. There is a lot going on with the plot, an apocalyptic story about mobile cities demolishing the weak, and a powerful weapon being in the wrong hands. And an intense chase sequences.The plot takes place in a post apocalyptic future when after the world has ended in according to the brief introduction called the sixty minute war. Everywhere around the globe is demolished. Landscapes become unpredictable with an unstable earth's crust. So cities are built to be mobile. Even then, the wasteland is a fight for survival when bigger cities like Londoner which has Thaddeus (Hugo Weaving) looking for more power and are taking down smaller mobile cities for their resources. Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) and her mining city was demolished and old parts were taken for artifacts or crushed. Hester has unfinished business with Thaddeus and fails to assassinate him. She escapes and an historian Tom (Robert Sheehan) tries to stop her. Realizes Thaddeus may not be the person he says he is. With an hidden agenda of building an ultimate weapon to take over other colonies. Hester and Tom will have to fight through the wasteland and escape from other scavengers, a cyborg bounty hunter Shrike (Stephen Lang), and Thaddeus mobile city.I am not sure how close the novel is to the movie. But the plot was great. Sure, there are moments when it felt like Mad Max Fury Road or Star Wars. Maybe elements were borrowed from other apocalyptic films or sci fi movies. The story was epic. I was kind of wanting to know more about the sixty minute war. It was briefly discussed. Also learn a little about Hester's childhood past about her mother and Thaddeus. A sub plot of Shrike and his motivation to go after Hester.The film has a lot of big, loud, and action packed moments. The opening sequence has an intense chase with Londoner going after a small mining city. And it does not stop from there. The visual effects are amazing. Set designs, costumes, and the concept scenery is just stunning. The showdown in the climax when Londoner reaches the big wall to a protected colony was spectacular.Junkie XL music score was awesome. Some music score felt a little similar to their previous films like Mad Max Fury Road. But it worked with the films tone and direction.Hera Wilmar is a beautiful stunning actress. Hugo Weaving was good as the villain. Robert Sheehan was also good playing an historian. More as a city boy than a survivalists outside of the city walls.Overall, Mortal Engines is a great film. The cast ensemble was great. The script delivered an epic plot of an apocalyptic story. For first time director Christian Rivers, he delivered on an epic, visual fest action sequences. That never slows down and it kept you on the edge of your seat until the end.",Mortal Engines
23,eddie_baggins,A dull and lifeless ride,4,10 December 2018,"In all honesty, I wasn't expecting much from Mortal Engines.A film that feels like it's come out too late in the dystopian piece, this Peter Jackson produced blockbuster has had a tough time convincing audiences that they should spend their hard earned dollars on catching it while it plays in cinemas but despite my low expectations and willingness to be pleasantly surprised, Engines left me cold, empty and rather disappointed in that it failed so miserably in giving its world a chance to succeed.So many elements of debut director Christian Rivers cinematic tale feel underutilised, under-cooked and under-developed, as we are quickly introduced to a future world landscape where humans have decided to build moving cities and roam the planet searching for resources, after a cataclysmic event wiped out a large portion of Earth's population and civilisations.Before you have much of chance to blink, we're introduced to a moving London, Hugo Weaving's scheming Thaddeus Valentine, Robert Sheehan's kind-hearted history buff Tom Natsworthy and Hera Hilmar's main protagonist Hester Shaw, who seeks vengeance against Valentine for past wrongs but in around all these introductions and numerous by the numbers action scenes, there's carefully little time spent on making any of it matter, disallowing us an audience to ever feel even slightly invested in what occurrences take place.Its all seriously frustrating, as this steampunk world seems like one that's open for exploration and the film often looks visually stunning thanks to the VFX work and set design, but it's a cold and far to basically developed universe to feel lived in and alive.Rivers struggles to explain why humanity decided its best option was to develop a collection of moving cities, there's almost no talk of what happened before these cities took shape and who on earth are the ancient ones and why does a Terminator named Shrike decide to adopt a human child?These are just some of the questions and thoughts that for some reason the team behind Engines decided not to answer and you can't help but escape the feeling that a first time director wasn't the storyteller required to bring Philip Reeve's novel to the big screen, with trite dialogue, awkward pacing and bad performances a staple of this film that could've been.You can sense the actors struggling with the material and while the only recognisable faces in the piece in the forms of Weaving and a motion captured Stephan Lang try their best gruff guy takes, relative newcomers Hilmar and Sheehan fail to inspire, while Asian megastar Jihae comes in too late in the piece to add any real spark to the piece as her rebellious pilot Anna Fang.Final Say -At its best a half-baked attempt to create a unique new movie universe, that's only saving graces are some neat visual flourishes, Mortal Engines is close to an entirely charmless and lifeless exercise in big budget filmmaking that appears destined to be one of the growing number of high profile failures of 2018.2 Minions out of 5",Mortal Engines

The cinematography, overall, was stanning. However, I did rushed and read the book before watching the movie, which was a big mistake. As the movie didn't have anthing unpredictable to offer towards the end, knowing exactly what is going to happen made it all more uninteresting. But, as an action - fantasy movie, mortal engines has a good world build up and the new universe that it introduces is well explained to the viewer as well. Plus, the action scenes were plenty. So, yes, the ending was boring, but the movie was okay.",Mortal Engines
25,leonblackwood,"Waste of time and money, but the original concept was decent. 3/10",3,11 May 2019,"Review:
What a total waste of time and money! All of the details that went into the extravagant sets, were wasted because there was way too much going on from one scene to the next. On top of that, all of the actors didn't put in a good performance, and the depth throughout the film was uninteresting and quite pointless. I liked the robot, Strike because his back story and determination to catch Hester Shaw, made complete sense, but the rest of the cast just got on my nerves after a while. I am also getting fed up with Hugo Weaving playing the same ""Baddie"" roles because he is a good actor who has a bigger range. The whole movie just seemed like a ""Mish Mash"" of other movies like Star Wars, Mad Max etc, which is why it really didn't go down well with audiences around the world. I do appreciate that the movie was based on a book, so I can't totally blame the crew of this film, but I must say that it's a terrible adaptation which must have looked good on paper. I'm not going to type an in-depth review about the storyline like I usually do because it has was too many twist and turns, and the technical jargon will is too complex and confusing, so I'll carry on giving my opinion of how the creators made a right shambles of this film. Now, on top of the corny script and awful looking ships, the ending was terrible, and I was expecting Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmer), to be some kick-ass Ninja skills, which she totally didn't. I can understand that she was miserable about her past, after losing her mum to the evil Thaddeus Valentine, but after being saved numerous times, she could have at least showed some sort of appreciation. As for Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan), he just got on my nerves from the very beginning, which is a shame because he was excellent in The Umbrella Academy. On the plus side, I was shocked to see that they actually built a lot of the sets, which makes it worse when you see how much it lost at the box office. They did use the hell out of CGI, but a lot of the action scenes were a right mess, especially the air battles. I will give it a couple of points because the concept was promising, but it's not in the same league as the Hunger Games or other movies in this genre. With Hugo Weaving being the biggest star in the movie, it's obvious that they would have to get some bigger names to get back the money they lost if they decide to make a sequel. I just hope they concentrate on the script more than the stupid moving cities, which looked ridiculous. I think you can tell that I really didn't like this film, but I stuck with it because I was expecting a big showdown towards the end, which turned out to be yet another disappointment. Waste of Time!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Christian Rivers, who also directed Minutes Past Midnight, which was an unheard-of movie. For such a big film, I'm surprised that he was given a big budget. Maybe it's because Peter Jackson contributed to the screenplay, and he also co-directed and produced this film, so the studio must have thought that it would be a guaranteed blockbuster after the success of the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit franchises. It has been calculated that the film lost the studio $174.7million when factoring together all expenses and revenues, making it the biggest box office bomb of 2018.Budget: $100million
Worldwide Gross: $83.6million (Flop!)Genre: Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Thriller

26,TheMovieDiorama,Mortal Engines immediately breaks down but eventually picks up a speed boost.,5,12 December 2018,"Adapted from Reeve's YA steampunk novel, ""Mad Max's Moving Castle"" is a visual splendour. Packing mechanical rhythms throughout the mobile empire of London and building a dense world based on history where 'Despicable Me' Minions are viewed as deities (I kid you not...). But beneath the petrol fumes is a shell that lacks substance, characterisation and underdeveloped subplots, making this moving city a static settlement. In a dystopian world where ""predator"" cities prey on small settlements, a fugitive assassin attempts to gain vengeance on the man who killed her mother. For a young adult film, and Satan knows there are many (too many), this is one of the better adaptations. A directorial debut for Rivers, who closely works with Jackson as a visual effects supervisor, where he manages to visualise a world that is packed with intuitive lore. There is an impressive sense of scale to be had with these motorised cities, particularly London, that creates for some awe-inspiring backdrops. However, all good things must come to an end and whilst the art department exceeded expectations, the screenplay writers and actors should be extradited.The story has no personality and predominantly consists of exposition, either through flashbacks or blatantly telling the audience. The characters themselves resemble tools rather that actual individuals. The Anti-Traction League members had no drive. Shaw lacked intent. Natsworthy was irritating. And the forced romance between them was predictably manufactured. Surprisingly, Valentine and Shrike were the only well developed characters, and they were the antagonists. Aside from Weaving and Jihae, the acting was weak. Sheehan did not suit the clumsy heroic role in the slightest and Hilmar didn't make an impression. Could've been replaced by anyone. Though there are some interests to be had passed the halfway mark.The ""Municipal Darwinism"" philosophy was interesting and made for some political reflections in our current society. The score boomed out epic compositions. But the saviour of this frequently boring flick is its third act. Once all the world building and character relationships have been established, the film just lets itself become genuine popcorn entertainment. I was able to let myself go, sink into my chair and watch the colossal carnage ensue. What started off as a terribly monotonous affair soon became this piece of entertainment that only just overcame the mediocrity that preceded it. There are faults. Many faults. But there is still fuel left in this post-apocalyptic tank.",Mortal Engines

Mortal Engines reminds me of past blockbusters like Independance Day and War of the Worlds (the Tom Cruise version) - good action, good visuals, but a rather simple story.The visuals of Mortal Engines are steampunk-like and are indeed good, the acting and everything else is rock solid, only the story is, hidden behind the veils of the visuals, a rather simple one, one that we all watched at least a thousand times before (a mix of ideas from Star Wars, Terminator, Mad Max, just to name some obvious ones).So all in all, Mortal Engines is not bad: like the Wachowskis' Jupiter Ascending (Mila Kunis) it got top visuals but (sadly) the story can't also not hold the ground.",Mortal Engines

31,southdavid,London Calling To The Faraway Towns,7,11 December 2018,"Peter Jackson produces this adaptation of a series of YA books to deliver this passable, if derivative film that has some aspects to admire but also room for improvement.The film revolves around Hester Shaw (played by Icelandic actress Hera Hilmar) who sneaks aboard the travelling city of London, in an attempt to assassinate the city's key scientific mind, Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving). She's foiled by historian Tom (Robert Sheehan) who in chasing her down ends up being cast out of London alongside her. Together, the pair discover the truth around Valentine and his plans, and must traverse the cruel scorched lands attempting to get back to London and save the city.There are numerous positives to ""Mortal Engines"". Christian Rivers, Jackson's long-time collaborator, has used his storyboarding eye to exceptional effect. The film looks brilliant, the low tech/high tech steampunk combinations are great to look at, and visually inventive. London mass transport system, made of a combination of red buses welded to the London Eye is just one of a number of striking images. It doesn't, perhaps, stand up to the greatest scrutiny in terms of logic but as a visual metaphor for the British Empire, cities overwhelming towns and globalisation it's pretty on the nose. The actors all do a decent job. Sheehan and Hilmar are, if I'm honest, a bit too old to be playing the characters convincingly, but there is nice chemistry between the two. Weaving is a natural villain and great in the role, even if I'm not sure I buy some of the lengths the character goes to as the film concludes.What works is less well is the overall story. Whilst I'm impressed that they didn't try to manufacture a franchise out of the series of books, and squeeze as much as possible into one movie, it does feel a little disjointed. There's no sense of time passing, or what sort of distance actually makes up this world. The subplot with Shirke in particular is the least fleshed out (pun intended). It is also, as others mentioned, a bit derivative of other movies, stealing its conclusion almost entirely from the original Star Wars Trilogy. It's also lacking in a bit of humour that might have made some of the dialogue more memorable.Though I didn't love it, it was entertaining enough for a couple of hours and, if the decision is made to make a sequel I'd see that too.",Mortal Engines
32,Vartiainen,"Interesting premise, bad characters",4,19 August 2020,"Mortal Engines is based on a novel by Philip Reeve and adapted into a movie by Christian Rivers as the director and Peter Jackson as one of the producers. It's a story of a post-apocalyptic steampunk world where Europe has become a barren wasteland, ravaged and foraged by enormous mobile city machines. Strong eats weak, Darwinism is all but a religion and anything from the old world is hailed as a divine relic.Pretty basic stuff, although the idea of a city having been remade into a mobile hunting platform is a fun one. And the does get some traction based on that idea. All the best CGI money shots are of those cities in motion.Unfortunately the rest of the film is nothing but one bland cliché after another. We have the status quo of the wealthy elite ruling over the poor. We have the rebellion fighting against the elite. We have the plucky youngster getting pulled into the rebellion after having his eyes opened to the cruelties of his elite peers. We have the too cool for school rebel leader with a tragic backstory. Actually, we have more than one of those. We have the good rival nation, the greener side of the fence, where everything is more civilized and better.And all those clichés are not insurmountable obstacles. Some of the best stories in the world are based on those exact clichés. It's the execution that's the key. Which unfortunately doesn't work here. The most egregious problem is the character writing. None of them are interesting. The least of all Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar). You know, the woman on the poster. The supposed main character. I honestly cannot name a single defining characteristic about her beyond the obvious clichés of her being tragic, emo and scarred.That being said, I did enjoy both Robert Sheehan as the plucky science lad getting pulled into the madness and Hugo Weaving as Thaddeus Valentine, the main antagonist. They were the only two actors I felt were giving it their all.Mortal Engines is a pretty film. It has eye candy galore. It simply isn't told well enough to rise above expectations.",Mortal Engines
33,jamesrupert2014,Spectacular but unsatisfying,6,7 February 2021,"In a post-apocalyptic steam-punk themed future, Britain takes a page from its colonial past as the great mobile City of London crawls around Europe gobbling up resources and threatening to assimilate non-mobile cultures. The imagery is imaginative, detailed and impeccably rendered, the cast are generally fine, and the story, which finds a group of plucky rebels defending their home base from a massive, nearly indestructible moving fortress armed with a new and formidable weapon, is serviceable if not overly original. All in all, the film has a lot going for it, most notably the special effects, but still manages to be just mediocre. None of the characters rise much above the standard tropes populating these kinds of films (even the usually reliable Hugo Weaving is bland as lead villain Thaddeus Valentine). The secondary story, which involves an obsessed cyborg pursuing heroine Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) has some great visuals but goes nowhere and abruptly concludes in anticlimactic schmaltz. I suspect that the film cut too many expository corners for viewers unfamiliar with the book (which I have not read) to really immerse themselves in the apocalyptic milieu. Another of the watchable but not memorable 'feast of the eyes, famine for the brain' films that CGI has made possible. Too bad - the premise is intriguing (I guess I'll have to read the book).",Mortal Engines
34,dfranzen70,"I mean, come ON.",3,14 March 2019,"My, but this was terrible. Incoherent, sloppy writing coupled with some absolutely awful CGI (the kind where you really notice that the actors are just standing in front of a green screen), and so, so many probably unintentional homages or ripoffs of Star Wars. The acting is pretty bland, particularly with co-lead Robert Sheehan, who seems like a really poor-man's version of Eddie Redmayne (at least regarding his Fantastic Beasts performance). Hera Hilmar, playing the true heroine Hester, is very good, all the better in comparison to her costars. And poor Hugo Weaving! He usually makes for a terrific villain, but here he looks bored and distracted. Just a dumb, loud disaster from start to finish, and it's a real shame - I hear the books were a lot of fun.",Mortal Engines

This is a post apocalyptic world-a sixty minute war caused the apocalypse-where whole cities ride around on wheels. It's based on a YA novel written by Philip Reeve and it's produced by Peter Jackson, of Lord of the Rings fame-it's an American/New Zealand collaboration. The bigger the city, the better it is for the population of that city because they ride around preying on smaller cities-or whatever else happens to get in their way. They scrounge for fuel, food, weapons and supplies. Hugo is the head honcho of one of the biggest rolling cities, London, and he has an agenda. Hera is a masked girl that has history with Hugo and wants to kill him so she sneaks on board his city. Robert is a resident of London that teams up with Hera on her mission and Stephen plays the guardian that helped raise Hera. The movie has a great look to it visually but the story is a little jumbled. It reminds me of a steampunk blender. It's as if someone took the plots of Star Wars, The Terminator, Mad Max and a few others and put them in a blender and this is what came out. It's not bad, it's just a little confusing.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and action and has a running time of 2 hours & 8 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright as a rental.",Mortal Engines
36,robfollower,Just don't over analyze everything and enjoy the ride.,7,4 May 2019,"Hundreds of years after civilization was destroyed by a cataclysmic event, a mysterious young woman, Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar), emerges as the only one who can stop London -- now a giant, predator city on wheels -- from devouring everything in its path.Mortal Engines is so damn enjoyable and beautiful to look at, I'm kind of glad it exists. The vehicle and world design is so aesthetically pleasing, the phrase ""eye candy"" doesn't do it justice. Especially the elegant airships.
With lots of impressive action, enhanced by breathtakingly detailed CGI, Mortal Engines is vibrant, energetic and exciting - a little too over-the-top at times, but not distractingly so. Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar), is the big surprise here: she puts in a strong performance and deserves to have a bright future ahead of her.
When I watch a fantasy science fiction like Mortal Engines I just want to relax and be entertained and that's exactly what I got so I'm not the one who's going to complain. Just don't over analyze everything and enjoy the ride.",Mortal Engines
37,CubsandCulture,"The story is rough, but the film made me want to read the book(s).",7,16 December 2018,"I am pretty sure this film is going to flop hard at the box office (maybe China can save it?) which is a pity because I would be interested in spending some more time in this world. My biggest problem with the film is it feels like entire scenes and sequences are missing. Some of the the world and plot does not make much sense but boy can I imagine explanations that would work to patch up the text. Strike, especially, is frustratingly unexplained but an intriguing mystery. Likewise the internal economy of the world is barely coherent in the film but the aspects that aren't explained make me want to find the answers. I really hope Wingnut continues the trend of releasing extended editions.Apart from the mythos being under-realized I thought the story was pretty good. It is fairly straightforward YA rebellion stuff mixed with personal revenge. It's been done before but I like the characters. Tom, especially, was a fun scientific romance hero. Some of the dramatic moments engage the emotions a little bit.Nonetheless the best features in the film are the technical aspects. Weta is always good at developing cultures. Mortal Engines is as detailed and immersive as their other projects, i.e. LOTR, Avatar, King Kong, ETC. London was a really fully realized graphically. I think anyone into steampunk will adore the look (through I guess it isn't steampunk proper) and I certainly love the mechanical, retro (?)-futuristic feel of the film. Rivers being a new(ish) director, unfortunately, lead to some shockingly bad blocking of scenes and the director's hand isn't as sure as it should be. But, in the end, the film made me want to explore this world some more and really that's more than I can say for other YA dystopian films released in the last few years.",Mortal Engines

39,kluseba,Quality time at your local movie theater for the upcoming holiday season,8,20 December 2018,"Mortal Engines is yet another dystopian science-fiction franchise consisting of four novels and this is the first movie of said franchise. This first entry in the franchise tells the story of an apprentice historian called Tom Natsworthy who lives in the mobile city of London and gets involved in a conflict opposing a mysterious fugitive assassin named Hester Shaw and the Head of the Guild of Historians called Thaddeus Valentine.The movie convinces with gorgeous high-quality visual effects that find the right balance between a realistic touch and splendid imagination. The idea behind moving cities that are destroying smaller towns to take their resources is quite creative. The different vehicles and planes are as imaginative as the strange creatures and machines in this world. Still, the film is profoundly human at heart and deals with topics such as family, freedom and loyalty. The film has solid pace and never gets boring as especially the vivid introduction makes it easy to empathise with the futuristic world and its characters. The story is somewhat predictable but still nicely executed thanks to likable characters like the naive historian, the resilient fugitive and the megalomaniac antagonist. The action sequences aren't too exaggerated but rather executed with care, drive and precision. Another advantage is that the movie has a proper conclusion despite being part of a franchise and you could stop following this franchise without any questions left unanswered after having watched this single film.Mortal Engines is a movie that should appeal to young teenagers and adults. Despite its dystopian setting, the movie isn't as brutal as The Hunger Games franchise, the romantic love story isn't as exaggerated as in Divergent and the language is more elegant than in The Maze Runner franchise for example. This movie could be described as a dystopian fairytale. Those who are looking for more sinister entertainment should watch Battle Royale and similar franchises instead. Mortal Engines is a film that is worth being watched at your local movie theater because of its astonishing visual and sound effects. It's a movie that could literally be interesting for the whole family except for very young children. Mortal Engines offers a nice occasion to escape a cold winter day and spend some quality at the cinema again.",Mortal Engines

Successfully creating a steampunk vision of a heavenly body w/literal 'cities on the move', we're soon let down by a story that initially presents a scarred (both physically & emotionally) heroine out for revenge against the scientist who killed her mother only to be pulled along but the affable yet vacant male lead in various adventures involving a nomadic android who pursues our girl for an apparent slight we never really understand to a vagabond group of air fighters who mount an insurgency against the encroaching evil power out to destroy them & the northerly utopia they've sworn to protect. Based on a series of novels, I felt the story wasn't sufficiently cracked which may be the fault of the filmmakers who've already 2 epic trilogies under the belt (The Rings & Hobbit films) but by treating this film as a 'one & done' may've killed any future entries since this account has equal moments of wonder & 'been there/down that' killing any interest the audience may have had.",Mortal Engines

It really follows the YA formula hard even while it tries and fails to subvert them. The biggest problem to me though is how much this is trying to cram in one movie. There are so many characters, so much world they're trying to force into this one movie that it felt congested and overstuffed.This is a pretty generic movie with some pretty scenery, meh acting and a massively overblown and underwhelming world.

Books give readers a couple hundred pages to absorb the worlds and the characters. Movies are limited to a couple of hours. Fantasy films are burdened with having to build a world quickly, and that world needs to be unique and fantastical, but at the same time realistic enough for the viewer to engage; the film must provide compelling characters that don't follow certain tropes; and the story can't replicate Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter lest ye risk the wrath of the nerds... The film also has to generate enough box office in order to warrant an expensive price tag (Mortal Engines is set to loose over $100 million, according to this article by Variety). It's hard to convince people who aren't a fan of fantasy films to see a film that 'looks weird', and this film certainly didn't have the draw of some more popular fantasy or science fiction titles. It's no wonder this film flopped. Did I hate this movie? Nope. Would I recommend it? Nope. Am I glad I watched it? I guess I got a few chuckles out of it. If you're a huge fan of fantasy, like myself, then you could give this a go, but unless you're an absolute diehard fan you can probably skip this and you wont be missing anything at all.

48,rgkarim,Revving Up The Engines To Breathtaking Visuals,7,15 December 2018,"Another Friday night, another visit to the theater to get set for the latest movie craze to hit the silver screen. Tonight's spectacle is all about another book brought to Hollywood with the glorious director of the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, Peter Jackson plastered all over the trailers to get people into the theaters to check it out. Can the master of the epic trilogies bring more magic to the cinema, or has the handing of the torch led to a breakdown that will leave us stranded for hours. Let's get started as Robbie K reviews:Film: Mortal Engines (2018)Director:
Christian Rivers
Writers:
Fran Walsh (screenplay by), Philippa Boyens (screenplay by)
Stars:
Hera Hilmar, Robert Sheehan, Hugo Weaving
LIKES:Acting: Perhaps not the most known cast, Mortal Engines crew has assembled to bring some decent performances to the mix. Sheehan and Hilmar has the emotional spectrum covered across the board, bringing more dynamic performances and some decent chemistry. Meanwhile Weaving, Jihae, and Leila George have a more limited approach, though do it well enough. Chemistry flows between the characters well enough, and establishes an awkward family that works well into the world.The Genre Mixing: It's difficult to blend obscure genres together in a manner that doesn't overpower or underwhelm each other. Mortal Engines fortunately works well to mix these elements together and bring with it a medium that has a little something for everyone. If one is a fan of these series, then I have no doubt there will be some alluring piece to grasp your attention.The World Building: The balanced blending of the genres allows for a wonderful world to design, animate, and bring to life. Jackson's imagination with his resources has accomplished the mission of building the world and crafting a spectacular display for your eyes to feast on. The various buildings mixed with vehicles are stunning to say the least, and as more colonies appear and different elements unfold with them, I certainly appreciated the attention to detail and seeing the various architecture mixed into the works.Costumes and Makeup: Books work hard to described their characters and pain the picture, leaving the movies to study and design their work to mirror those details. Again, the team succeeds in bringing the characters to life with an amazing wardrobe and visual effects to the table. Whether you are a secondary character or a leading star, Mortal Engines costumes reflect the culture to which these characters were established in.. From the fabric choices to the colors themselves, one will become immersed into the setting perhaps desiring their own modern meeting traditional styles. Needless to say, this film inspired a number of costume plays in the future.DISLIKES:Story: The Lore is there, the basics are there, and the truth is there is enough balance to set the stage for potential sequels. Yet this first installment lacks quality to really expand upon the characters they promoted in the trailers. Mortal Engines gets enough of the engines warmed up to at least lay out the track, giving pieces of each story to connect all the points, and try to give all the background information to complete the tale. Yet, the piece meal presentation, rushed details, and hasty wrap ups is where they dropped the ball. I believe the lore is there, but it's just missing that finesse that I believe it needed.Shrike's Roar: A small dislike, the supposed creepy automaton looks the part and has fantastic structure, but is a bit too flat for the envisioned role. Shrike's call for Ester is more humorous, a fallacy of voice work that sounds like Smiegel from LOTR meeting the Terminator. The overuse of the yell was more comical than menacing, and as such was a tactic that did not meet it's intended mark of terror.More Action: Yes, I'm a broken record into his category, but the trailers painted some promising action sequences to help bring the adventure to this film. The opening was very shiny and alluring, with the hopes of action soaring to new heights, and then the momentum was dropped. Much of Mortal Engines fights are gritty, but not quite as suspenseful as I had hoped. While keeping in time with the rhythm and feel of the movie, this particular film still could have spiced up its action factor to add that needed suspense to the mix. The ending showed the momentum building once more, only to have the brakes slammed on for the grand finale. Perhaps a little more development into the mix could have taken this film to new heights, but at least there are visuals to handle.Suspense-less: Mortal Engines other main area of improvement for me is the lack of suspense in the film. Some of this comes from the dislikes mentioned above, but one other major scrap point is the predictability of the film and scrapping of other films to decorate this vehicular town adventure. These two aspects combined make for obvious foreshadowing, as the director takes you on an obvious pathway that quickly sheds its intensity like the various pieces of discarded equipment. Sure, the references are fun to pick out and quite comical in their application to this film, however, there was only so much leading down this direction before it soon got out of hand, leading to well the anticlimactic finale.The VERDICT:Overall, Jackson's resources have brought the world to life, as steampunk and fantasy mix together to make an amazing world to ride into. With a fantastic visual support and imagination supporting the actors, Mortal Engines is truly the theater worthy visual spectacle to behold. Yet, the movie's nonvisual elements are needing a little repair, helping to iron out details and pump some suspense into the engine to fuel this film. A second installment could be waiting in the garage, but if so, we could use some of this integration and repair to bring these limitations to the next level. Still, the visuals alone should hopefully be worth a trip to the theater, but definitely worth checking out at home if you are waiting for something better.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 7.5

The film is set in a post-apocalyptic future where civilization has been wiped out. What's left of the human race has rebuilt cities as war vehicles designed to destroy and loot other cities. A girl named Hester Shaw tries to revenge her mother and stop London from destroying the shield wall, a wall that protects the peaceful, non-moving cities.I dislike how fast it moves. There are lots of action scenes and some of them get a bit too fast. On the other hand, these action scenes are well planned out and have lots of moving parts. In almost all of them, the characters are fighting while the city falls apart.The CGI in this movie is really impressive. The steampunk cities that fill the movie are thought out thoroughly. Shrike, a humanoid robot, is well designed. He looks very realistic, but with lots of sci-fi details. I specifically like how he can hold onto the ground by folding his feet down. This is a unique ability that isn't over or under used. I enjoy Stephen Lang's voice as Shrike. It gives an expected, eerie feeling to his character. The makeup for Hester's scar is great, looking realistic but not too over the top.The moral of Mortal Engines is that you can accomplish anything if you work as a team. This is shown when Hester refuses to work with her friends until the end, when they must work together to stop London from destroying the shield wall.
The music is often too overpowering. In several scenes, the music actually takes away from what is happening on screen. For example, in the final set it gets so loud that you can't hear what the characters are saying.My favorite scene is at the beginning, when they show the landscape of this post-apocalyptic future and then, quickly jump into the action with a fun chase scene. This scene is very intense and shows what most of the movie is all about.
I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to ages 12 to 15.Reviewed by Rohan F., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.",Mortal Engines

52,pc95,Goes from OK to Bad to Awful in its runtime,4,9 June 2019,"(spoilers)Hamstrung by a drowning script of well-trodden cliche after cliche, ""Mortal Engines"" can't come up with much of anything original after its opening 15 min of stage-setting. I knew it flubbed at the box office, and was unpleasantly disappointed that the flubbing was justified. What is in store for you if you decide to go through the 128 min runtime? There's the secret weapon, the ""alliance"", a terminator wannabe, and who could forget, a nuclear weapon count-down.. Closing lines: ""So what happens now?"" -- ""We go where the wind takes us"".

54,moviexclusive,"Visually spectacular but otherwise narratively clunky, the impressive world-building cannot make it for its lack thereof in plot and character-building",6,7 December 2018,"Peter Jackson has been at the front and centre of the promotional campaign for 'Mortal Engines', the first in a series of four YA novels by British author Philip Reeve, so much so that you might think that he is its filmmaker in the same way as 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit' trilogies. But despite being a passion project of his, Jackson is only its co-writer and co-producer, having handed directorial duties to his long-time VFX artist-collaborator Christian Rivers. That distinction pretty much explains why the movie is what it is - visually spectacular from start to finish, but in both plotting and characterisation, as clunky as some of the second-, even third-rate, steampunk metropolises that we see in the film.Oh yes, to say that 'Mortal Engines' looks gorgeous on the big-screen is in itself an understatement. Every single element of the distant post-apocalyptic future that it is set is intriguing, be it the giant motorised cities propelled on rusty treads and steel wheels that barrel through the barren wastelands, or the flying airships of a band of rebel pilots called the Anti-Traction League and the floating city of Airhaven where they gather, or the half-machine half-zombie stalkers built of dead persons with their nervous systems implanted in cyborgs that are hence devoid of feelings and memories. There is plenty of mythic world-building potential in the material, and it's not hard to see why Jackson was attracted to it in the first place, or why he had chosen to hand the reins of the movie to Rivers.These strengths are evident right from the get-go, which opens with an exhilarating sequence where the towering predator city of London engages in a death race with one component of a quaint mining colony through what is left of Europe. After a nail-biting pursuit, London shoots massive harpoons at the helpless hamlet to reel it in, and eventually gobbles it up to plunder its resources while consigning its inhabitants to be low-level immigrants within the city. Similarly, the finale that unfolds as a showdown between London and the walled-up nation state of Shan Guo is just as breathtaking, alternating between the awesome destruction wrought by London's quantum-powered super-weapon known as MEDUSA and the guerrilla airborne counter-attack launched by a couple of Anti-Traction rebels.But in between these graphically stunning episodes is a much more pedestrian story that feels like it was scavenged from better fantasy epics, comprising essentially of a naïve apprentice historian cum wannabe flyboy hero Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan) who teams up with the mysterious scarred assassin Hester Shaw (Icelandic actress Hera Hilmar) to stop the power-hungry Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving) from unleashing Armageddon upon what remains of the rest of the world. Using pieces of old-tech that have survived the calamitous Sixty-Minute War which had wiped out current civilisation, Thaddeus is putting in place the final pieces of his plan to build the aforementioned super-weapon MEDUSA, and had many years earlier killed Hester's mother Pandora to obtain a crucial piece of the weapon.As you might expect, Tom and Hester starts off as rivals before forming an unlikely partnership that has romantic entanglements as well. Alas too little attention is paid to the evolving relationship dynamic between the teenage couple, so much so that when the bickering exiles supposedly develop feelings for each other in the third act, we're left feeling unconvinced. Thaddeus' motivation for world-domination is never explained, relegating him therefore to a straightforward villain who is just there because the story needs one. To distract us from its under-developed key characters, Jackson (who co-wrote the script with his regular screenwriting partners Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens) throws in a number of interesting but otherwise superficial secondary roles that add little to the central revenge tale.Among these, Thaddeus' daughter Katherine (Leila George) and a scruffy local mechanic named Bevis Pod (Ronan Raftery) barely register, even though they are intended to form the resistance to Thaddeus' plan from within. Faring the best is the notorious outlaw Anna Fang (Korean singer/actress Jihae), who plays the equivalent of the swaggering kick-butt space pirate for all its worth, although you'd hoped that there was somehow more to the back-story between Anna and Pandora. And perhaps the most ill-conceived of them all is Shrike (Stephen Lang), one of them stalkers whom Thaddeus releases from captivity to track and kill Hester; without giving away too much, let's just say that Shrike and Hester share a complicated father-daughter bond that is so poorly handled that we almost burst out laughing at the former's denouement.These narrative flaws ultimately reduce what could have been a sweeping dystopian epic into little more than a series of imaginatively realised environments, locations and cities. In particular, we wish we had more time exploring the English capital, whose landmarks such as St. Paul's Cathedral and the London Eye have been intriguingly repurposed. Indeed, there was much potential in the story itself - including its themes of 'municipal Darwinism' and contrast of East and West cultures - but much of that is lost amidst a hectic, even frenetic, need to rush from set-piece to set-piece, while neglecting both plot and character to add up to something more poignant. Such are its mortal sins, and as much as we appreciate how this is a labour of love for Jackson and his Wingnut Films, we suspect it is after all too weak and uncompelling to kickstart a whole new sci-fi franchise.",Mortal Engines
55,fntstcplnt,Mortal Engines (2018),6,29 November 2019,"Directed by Christian Rivers. Starring Hera Hilmar, Robert Sheehan, Hugo Weaving, Jihae Kim, Leila George, Stephen Lang, Ronan Raftery, Patrick Malahide, Colin Salmon, Andrew Lees, Regé-Jean Page, Frankie Adams, Leifur Sigurdarson, Menik Gooneratne, Sarah Peirse, Kee Chan. (PG-13)In a distant post-apocalyptic future, a motorized London-on-wheels devours smaller, weaker towns for Darwinistic harvesting purposes; young Hilmar and Sheehan are pursued by the city's guildmaster Weaving after a couple of botched murder attempts, eventually joining forces with an opposition group called the Anti-Traction League. Epic-scale, superbly-designed production is a feast for the eyes and imagination, an extravaganza of inventive special effects and technology, but it's populated by thinly-drawn characters and driven by an incessant, unevenly-paced storyline--a strange but promising premise never fully realized. Aside from Lang's haunting, relentless cyborg stalker, nothing much registers beyond the sheer spectacle and exciting world-building ideas; it's the sort of steampunk-fantasy world one would love revisting and exploring at length...just with something more original and/or engaging in the narrative driver's seat. With everything so rushed and jumbled and overstuffed (Raftery's character simply disappears around the two-thirds point, never to be mentioned again), it almost certainly would have worked better expanded into two parts or even a trilogy, but considering how unsuccessful the film was at the box office, the completing story chapters would have never made it to the big screen anyway.61/100",Mortal Engines

The characters and the plot seemed to be rushed for me, and there seemed so much more to explore before it rushed to its inevitable conclusion.

The robot creature reminiscent of a terminator was also a nice touch and could have spawned a movie on his own!Also loved the veiled Brexit references ""London City - why did we ever come to europe"" lol Luvv it!Hugo weaving was magic as ever and the whole thing just left that feel good feeling you used to get when you left the cinema decades ago - I for one am glad to see it is still alive.I actually thought it was going to be Emily Blunt from the advert of the girl with the red mask - I think some creative photoshopping went on there! Standout performances from new girl Hera Hilmar and I have always liked Irishman Robert Sheehan who always gives a smashing performance - great casting and good chemistry between the two made this the standout movie of the year for me!It once again proves that the critics know jack once again!

59,martimusross,I Enjoyed It While I Was Watching It,5,15 March 2019,"This movie looked so promising but some aspects were really not thought through;1, The main character Hester Shaw, was just so unrelentingly miserable, why anyone would be attracted to this storming-in, storming-out bundle of teenage angst I have no clue.2, There really was just to much CGI, clever tricks need to support a strong story and characters, this felt like all meat and no bones and very much style over substance.3, ""Municipal Darwinism"", a really quite ridiculous philosophical position even in a science fiction movie, a city is a thing, and therefore cannot be a hunter. Secondly when Thaddeus Valentine say he is abandoning this philosophy but then wants to attack, destroy and absorb the Chinese city the plot goes off the deep end.4, Old tech becomes a rare and dangerous commodity, and really this luddite approach fails to recognize that it is not the bomb that is the threat but the person who has his hand over the button to use the bomb. This thinking is just not joined up.5, Strike is a great character, if Hester had merely explained to him that she wanted to kill her mothers killer he would have probably helped her.

There is a character who is a mechanical corpse who is essentially The Terminator who makes a fun addition to the plot. If you like a movie that has the amazing Hugo Weaving and delivers a lot of goods, this is the movie for you! I would highly suggest watching it with an open mind though.

61,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Very underwhelming effort from Peter Jackson.,4,12 April 2019,"Mortal Engines is 2018's most derivative film and very underwhelming effort from the man and production team who brought us The Lord of the Rings and King Kong; now here comes his latest project and it's a Star Wars rip-off that takes from Bioshock, Mad Max, The Golden Compass and The Terminator. It's a spectacle backed by a frustratingly derivative story which doesn't compliment the otherwise beautiful visual effects.The whole treatment of the hero's journey in this movie is so ham-fisted and predictable that it's a surprise this film hasn't been ironically memed on the internet yet. The hallmarks of modern blockbusters are all here: explosions galore, deuz-ex machina and convenient backstory discovery from unfamiliar faces and a twist ending that 'explains everything'. This is the kind of film that would inspire cliche-driven drinking games thanks to its by-the-numbers script, stereotype leads and placeholder film score. The bests thing about the film is the visual effects, but they're not enough to warrant a viewing on their own.I'm disappointed in this film: it's not a good moviegoing experience, but it's a good laugh to be had.

62,RNMorton,Mixed feelings,8,29 December 2018,"I can accept any review you want to dish out on this, from tired and trite to awesome. Right off the bat I could feel it was a blend of Star Wars and Mad Max, maybe with a little War of the Worlds thrown in. The lead actors were good (Anna Fang was occasionally obvious but spectacular throughout) and a lot seemed new at the start. Just the idea of ""London"" on Wheels crossing the Channel to wreck havoc on Europe was inspired. But then as we began to wind things up there were those deja vu moments. If the first 2/3s weren't so good I wouldn't care, but they were and then they sort of blew it in the home stretch.
So here's my tip to Peter Jackson and Ms. Walsh and anyone else writing a new sci fi saga. I'll try to be discreet to avoid the necessity of a spoiler. The plot may seem great on it's own in a vacuum. But if it's been done before then you can't do it again, even if it's not the inspiration for your work. You HAVE to rewrite the end so it isn't a reboot of other films, even if it doesn't work as well. That's my two cents and I'm sticking to it.

Cities running over wheels and they eat each other to survive is a new plot of its kind. Start to finish full of actions and thrills. However, the end is not much effective nor significant.

68,phubbs,Mortal Engines,5,9 June 2019,"OK so let me start this review by explaining my initial thoughts on this movie and its basic premise. As I'm sure many are aware the basic idea in this movie is how civilisation has crumbled after a devasting war and the remaining humans have, for some reason, decided to mount all the remaining cities on wheels so they can 'drive them around' so to speak. Well although this sounds cool on paper (in a kind of GamesWorkshop related way) I also found it to be simply ludicrous.Obviously I know this is based on a fantasy novel and the entire concept is outlandish science-fiction, but really? So firstly I would have to ask how the feck mankind is supposed to have put their cities onto such huge chassis. This would mean they would have had to dig up famous landmarks (such as St. Paul's in London), load them onto the chassis, and then somehow fix them in place to said chassis. I then found myself asking what about the rest of London? How did they decide what to save? Are all the other buildings custom made for the new London-on-wheels or have they also been dug up and planted on the chassis?I then found myself asking the most fundamental question (I think). What is the actual point in building (or putting) a city on wheels? How does that benefit the city? I mean yeah sure you could move it to the coast in the summer but it just seems so utterly stupid. Just looking at these things they look so fragile, vulnerable, and in one case completely top heavy. A neat fantasy idea for a cool image and again it sounds wicked on paper, but when you actually see it in live action and try to think about it logically it raises SO many questions. Also the fact that mankind has done this after an apocalyptic event really makes little sense. Not to mention the fact they still seem to have a lot of technology, materials, food, water, and working men to actually build all this stuff. These vast mobile cities are damn impressive feats, yet they go around destroying each other.My last nagging question relates to the land itself. It seems that the surface of the Earth has changed since the '60 minute war' and countries like the UK have now joined mainland Europe (?). Anyway, considering how vast the mobile city of London is (and I assume some other cities), it got me wondering if there was enough space on the land for all these mobile metropolises. Heck even the smaller mobile cities are pretty big and its indicated there are many of them. I mean you could ask the same about ocean-going cruise liners in our present day and obviously there is plenty of ocean for lots. But if there were loads all roaming around on their own accord I'm sure there would be problems. This also led to me ask what state the land would be in. These gigantic mobile cities tearing and grinding up the earth as they piledrive along. The land would be wrecked, flattened, no trees, no plant life, no animal life, a complete wasteland.As for the actual movie, well its a mixed bag really and does indeed remind you of some other large budgeted sci-fi movie failures of recent. First off it is very much your bog standard 'Star Wars' type clone with all the usual bog standard characters. Mix in some other very common elements from some other well known classic franchises (I don't even need to mention them) and this is the inevitable result. The only aspect of this movie that was slightly fresh was the steampunk aspect, which I liked.But yeah you have your standard unwilling hero who finds himself thrust into a war of which he was somewhat naive about (and in this case looks disturbingly like Justin Trudeau). The standard strong female character who is trying to get revenge. The standard well-spoken leader who is actually behind closed doors the nasty villain. And then basically a whole load of background characters doing the usual stuff for both sides. I also have to mention that yet again we have a clear case of all the goodies being a multicultural bunch. Whereas all the baddies are all white, just like in 'The Last Jedi'. A strange and increasingly obvious Hollywood trend.I mean in all honesty, aside from the admittedly cool and intriguing visuals, there isn't really that much going on here. It has the exact beats (both character and plot-wise) you would expect from a sci-fi feature of this ilk, literally scene for scene. In one sequence the main villain Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving) wants to unleash this cyborg from a prison so it can hunt down and kill the main hero Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar). Now Weaving's character is highly important in this movie, he has sway and power. Yet in order to release this cyborg he destroys the entire prison killing everyone. Couldn't he get this thing out without doing that? This attack also highlights how vulnerable and badly designed these mobile vehicles are, in this case a spider-like walking prison. One shot to a leg joint and down it goes.And speaking of the cyborg (a clear Terminator rip-off called Shrike), what was that all about? From what I can gather these things were men that have been killed in battle and then resurrected with mechanical body parts. And apparently there was an entire army of them. This particular one looked after Hester as a child after her mother had been murdered. Why this killer cyborg decided to do this I don't know. But the really odd thing is the fact that the cyborg offers to turn Hester into an undead cyborg (because she is suffering depression from the murder of her mother). Hester agrees (!!) and makes a promise with Shrike. But in changing her mind Hester breaks that promise which triggers Shrike to continually hunt her down in order to kill her and transform her into an undead cyborg (eh???). This entire subplot was just idiotic and was completely pointless to the movie. You could literally remove it all, utterly aimless.Of course Shrike eventually tracks Hester down to a city in the sky (yes that's right a city in the sky, in the clouds if you will...ahem) and in the ensuing battle the city starts to fall apart. Shrike gets badly damaged and Hester does find her original love for Shrike is reignited as the cyborg is obviously about to expire. And in typical action movie fashion despite the entire city falling apart around them with explosions and debris, both Hester and Shrike manage to muster enough time in order to have an emotional farewell (in true 'Terminator' fashion).So yeah suspension of disbelief is required for this movie. Whilst that might sound obvious for a sci-fi fantasy it's a bit different for this one seeing as its sorta supposed to reflect upon certain obvious political issues of our current time such as capitalism, climate change, easily manipulated governmental systems, non-renewable energy etc...Cities that 'eat' and 'absorb' other cities which only benefits the few (in the cities) instead of everyone which would possibly lead to a better future. Basically saying, or highlighting, how society can/could eat itself. This can be easily detected in the story but the sci-fi element is so zany with its wheeled warrior cities the social commentary kinda gets smothered. Not to mention the sheer quantity of horrendous greenscreen effects and shots. Stand aside 'Star Wars' prequels, there's a new joker in town.So yeah, the wheeled tank-like cities concept is engaging but ultimately really stupid. The rest of it is by the numbers science fiction which can be somewhat fun but only when the characters are actually onboard some kind of moving vehicle (they aren't very good characters that's why). Once they fall off onto the ground the movie literally stops dead, which is weird when you think about it. This is a highly imaginative and packed world for sure but as said before it owes so much to other films and tries to do too much. I felt like I was watching the final movie in a trilogy (or more!). The movie really feels like it needs sequels but I doubt that will happen. One thing I will say, I reckon this has future cult status written all over it.5.5/10",Mortal Engines

The trailer never seemed that great to me, but seeing Jackson's name attached made me think that this would be great. Was disappointed to finally find out that it wasn't made by Jackson and also the negative reviews surrounding the film. I have to echo the sentiments of what others were saying, the film looks nice and you can tell effort was put into the film but it just never delivers.The film is set on a post apocalyptic Earth, where cities are on wheels and motorized. These cities are at war with each other. Amidst all this Esther Shaw, a young assassin plots to get revenge against a man named Thaddeus Valentine because he had murdered her mother years prior. Along the way she befriends a man named Tom as they attempt to thwart Valentine and his plans to become an all powerful figure who plans to bring catastrophic results to the warring cities.This film was filled with faces of actors that I didn't recognize, apart from Hugo Weaving. I thought the characters weren't strong nor did I have any real desire to get behind them. Some aren't developed very well. The action is always present and the film looks great visually, nothing wrong with the effects here. The plot is disappointing and at times becomes wayward and just felt like a lesser version of other films like Star Wars and Mad Max: Fury Road.The film was a large scale steam punk failure in all honesty. As it progressed I just felt less and less interested in the narrative. I mean maybe if you are baked you will find enjoyment in this but I thought it was unintentionally humorous and stupid.

The idea of motorized cities was amusing, but that wasn't the point. The main story was revenge: Valentine killed Hester Shaw's mother and now Shaw wants to take revenge.

72,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A mold-breaking film that was fun to watch.,10,8 March 2019,"If I were to look at Mortal Engines (2018) critically, I'd notice a number of flaws. From fairly flat characters to a string of movies and directors that it tries to imitate, this film should be terrible. And yet, given that I'd already suspended my disbelief by entertaining the idea that an apocalypse would result in cities mounting up on enormous machines and scavenging smaller towns for fuel, I found this movie incredibly entertaining. Perhaps the base plot isn't too original, but the execution felt fresh and new. Somehow, I was able to turn off my critical brain and just enjoy this movie for what it is: pure, unadulterated fun.As someone who appreciates film as an art form, there is plenty of it on display here. The look, feel, and aesthetic of Mortal Engines is so bold and consistent that the core concept of the plot naturally follows. The visuals and soundtrack merely accentuate the action and drive it forward in a way that allowed me to lose myself in the fantasy. And perhaps that's why I liked this film: there have been very few fantasy or sci-fi films that have tried to push that creative envelope. Sure, it's not a ""safe"" movie that plays to conventions. It attempts something new and more or less succeeds in bringing it to life.In the end, I didn't care that Mortal Engines likely stole inspiration from Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), Snowpiercer (2013), Stardust (2007), Terminator (1984), and an endless litany of Terry Gilliam films. I didn't care that it was basically the plot from Star Wars (1977). I like all of these movies, so the fact that Mortal Engines was able to combine them all into something that still made sense was a plus. Heck, I appreciated that it didn't have to explain itself. Sometimes explaining something ridiculous like this ruins the magic of it.A mold-breaking film that was fun to watch, I give Mortal Engines 5.0 stars out of 5.",Mortal Engines

Director Christian Rivers just didn't get me invested, in any of the characters in the movie. I'm surprised that veterans like Peter Jackson, wrote a script with such cringe-worthy dialogues. All the action set pieces didn't interest me in the least bit. Moreover, the choppy editing prevents us from seeing any of the action scenes properly.

Epic effects, actually take your breath away effects which unfortunately don't help the story, in fact this film reminded me of another recent film which relied on effects but had a very weak story, Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets.I can watch a film and forget about real life allowing me to enjoy the film but when a story is so predictable, when a story relies on something owned from childhood and its only just coincidence that an item is opened for the first time just when it's needed, when a story relies on effects to sell it then I do actually want a story that surprises, keeps you wanting to watch but honestly in parts of this epic I felt my eye lids getting heavy because whilst the effects are epic the story isn't.In summary a film that you don't have to think about, just watch and enjoy which for me was it's only weak point.Rating 8 out of 10",Mortal Engines

79,abisio,The most visually stunning movie ever made,9,14 December 2018,"Let's put the things in perspective. This is an Outback production not a Hollywood one. However the level of digital imagery is the greatest and more realistic ever seen; even when what we are seeing is impossible.
It is true that the story is not a match with the visuals. It is pretty standard; but keep moving very fast and allow an spectacular scene after the other.It seems the director took YA novel and reduced it to the basis in order to have two hours of pure entertainment and letting go an unconcealed critic to the British government and society.
The predator city is called London, and basically ""ingest"" less powerful cities in order to survive. Inhabitants are assimilated but as a lower class while the upper class living and differentiate from the rest.
People cheer when another city is attacked as a Roman circus
London is at war with everybody else; specially those other powerful cities that decides to be static and united.Compared with other PG-13 movies; this is violent, sometimes bloody and brutal. Combining spectacular decadence with something of the Mad Max world (what do you expect coming from Down Under).While the script is simple entertaining; the acting of the main characters is barely acceptable. Exception of course Hugo Weaving that creates a bad guy that can change from loving friend and father to selfish and merciless killer in the blink of an eye. He really setup a very high bar for future villains.In brief; it is not a great movie but the visuals deserve 11 over 10; if the script deserves a 7; the whole thing can be perfectly rounded to a 9.",Mortal Engines
80,bob-the-movie-man,"At last, the hilarious Brexit comedy we've all been waiting for.",5,23 December 2018,"As comedy goes it's classic gold! London has been transferred, presumably via a futuristic huge forklift truck of some kind, onto a huge chassis and is now chugging its way across mainland Europe. Needing fuel, it has the capability to gobble-up (take that Barnier!) other towns and cities (also roaming the countryside) which London 'digests' (smoke that Tusk!). Curiously, the captured cities' inhabitants are not exterminated but integrated into the City's population: so much for any anti-immigration policy! (LOL).But all doesn't go entirely smoothly for the UK capital. The Lord Mayor of London (Patrick Malahide) declares ""We should never have gone into Europe. It's the biggest mistake we ever made"". (Classic: how we SNORTED with laughter!)Stuffing it squarely to the 'remainers', London makes its own future. ""It's time to show the world how strong London can be"". Having conquered most of Europe, it's time to set its sights on new markets to conquer: so London takes the Chinese on! (Now the tears of laughter are flowing freely!) Trade deals have never been more entertaining since ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace""!OK, so in the interests of 'advertising standards', I'd better make clear before you rush out to the cinema expecting a comedy feature that my tongue is firmly in my cheek here. For ""Mortal Engines"" is the latest sci-fi feature from Peter Jackson. But when viewed from a Brexit perspective, it's hilarious!In terms of plot, this (like ""Waterworld"") makes clever use of the Universal logo to set the agenda. The world has been decimated with a worldwide war - though clearly one that selectively destroyed bits of London and not others! - and the survivors must try to survive in any way they can. Settlements are divided between those that are 'static' and those (like London) that are mobile and constantly evolving: ""Municipal Darwinism"" as it is hysterically described. But London, or rather the power-crazed Londoner Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), wants revolution rather than evolution and he is working on development of one of the super-weapons that started the world's demise in the first place.But Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar), separated when young from her mother Pandora (yes, she has a box and we've seen it: wink, wink) is intent on stopping him, since she is on a personal path of vengence. Teaming up with Londoner Tom (Robert Sheehan) and activist Anna Fang (Jihae) they must face both Thaddeus and the ever-relentless Shrike (Stephen Lang) to try to derail the destructive plan.Anna Fang declares ""I'm not subtle"" and neither is this movie. The film is loud and action-filled and (as a significant plus) visually extremely impressive with it. I'm not a great fan of excessive CGI but here it is essential, and the special-effects team do a great job. The production design is tremendous - a lot of money has been thrown at this - and the costume design inventive, a high-spot (again snortworthy) being the Beefeater guards costumes!Where the film really crashes, like a post-Brexit stock market, is with the dialogue. The screenplay by Jackson himself, with his regular writers Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens contains some absolute clunkers, notwithstanding the unintended LOL-worthy Brexit irony. It's jaw-droppingly bad, believe me.As for 'the turns', the only real ""name"" in the whole film is Jackson-favourite Hugo Weaving. Just about everyone else in the cast is pretty well unknown, and in many cases it shows. Standing head and shoulders though for me over the rest of the cast was Icelandic actress Hera Hilmar, who strikes a splendidly feisty pose as the mentally and physically scarred Hester. I look forward to seeing what she does next.Story-wise, there's not a sci-fi film that's not been looted, and a number of other films seem to be plundered too. (I can't comment on how much of this comes from the source book by Philip Reeve). The Londonmobile looks for all the world like Monty Python's ""Crimson Permanent Assurance Company""; the teenage female lead is Sarah Connors, relentlessly pursued by The Terminator; the male lead is archaologist cum hot-shot pilot Indiana Solo, leather jacket and all; there is a Blade Runner moment; a battle that is a meld of ""The Great Wall"" and Morannon from ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers""; a less sophisticated aerial location from ""The Empire Strikes Back""; and another classic Star Wars moment (without the words being actually said!).Now I'm loathe to say anything bad about director Peter Jackson, after his breathtakingly memorable ""They Shall Not Grown Old"". And the film has its moments of flair, most memorably a ""life flashing before your eyes scene"" that I found genuinely moving. But overall, as an actioner, it's a bit of a mess. It's a long way from being the worse film I've seen this year by a long stroke - it kept me interested and amused in equal measure for the running time. But I think given it's initially bombed at the Box Office, any plans Jackson had to deliver a series of these movies might need to be self-funded.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

81,Snootz,Star Wars with a good helping of Goofy,6,11 March 2019,"After reading many of the reviews here I see a widely split audience. I can understand why, however I believe that those who condemn this with 1 & 2 stars are really being unfair. Seriously-- they're comparing this with the worst movies in history? Perhaps a bit less emotional cinematic balance is in order.This is neither the best nor the worst movie ever made. It is a visual eye-candy fest somewhat crippled by a ludicrous premise (moving cities on treads), a story that has so many Star Wars references it's just... well actually it was rather fun pointing out all the Star Wars references. But the hokey one-liners, marginal acting (except for Hugo Weaving, who rawks as usual), and so many jump the shark moments that by the end they were importing more sharks to jump.If one were being super-critical, then of course we could wonder things such as ""why use hydrogen instead of helium in an air city?"" (Yeah, that would be a REALLY valid question). One would also wonder why there were no defenses AHEAD of the shield wall. We could slam the concept of how much energy and fuel it would take to run one of those gargantuan monster cities (and impossibility of doing so), or point out that the entire populace would have been smashed to little gooey puddles every time they hit a major pot hole. Yes, there were all kinds of flaws throughout the film.That's if we were being super-critical. But anyone who has seen any Transformers movie and then rates this less than one of those atrocities would be most unfair. The special effects in this were rather incredible-- and I say that in a day when CGI has made special effects hum-drum. People who say they were ""bored"" at this must have some kind of major bio-chemical flaw, because there was little in this continual adrenaline romp that was boring. (Absurd, yes. Not boring.) Okay yeah, there was no nudity, no extreme blood and gore, no graphic sex, endless obscenities, etc etc. So I guess some jaded viewers might find it ""boring"".For the average viewer however, the average ratings tell the tale. A lot of people liked it, some loved it, a lot of people hated it, some (like me) accepted the good parts, got a chuckle from the bad parts.The real tell-tale is the box-office, which performed dismally. That's what happens when people listen to too many pompous critics rather than making their own decisions. (It's also what happens when the theaters charge so much for popcorn and drinks they make it far more economical to just wait for the DVD.)Did I enjoy the movie? In an absurdist, over-the-top, jump-the-shark, amazing CGI kind of way, yeah. As a cerebral film that is one of the best movies of all time? Not even in the running. It's basically fast-food face-candy, like so many action-packed sci-fi movies these days.Anyone who can sit through Batman vs Superman or the latest X-Men movies should be able to stomach this one. For those who rated this 1-star... seriously... you folks need to stop watching sci fi action movies and switch to another genre. Why continue to cause yourselves pain by attending movies you know ahead of time you're going to hate? I mean, get a clue.This is a sci-fi action romp with somewhat astounding CGI-- and nothing more. It's a Star Wars wannabe that misses the mark. Worth watching? Probably. Going to take home anything special from it? Aside from an adrenaline high, probably not.",Mortal Engines

83,kuarinofu,I wish they would've split this movie in 2-3 parts (detailed look + major spoilers),6,9 February 2019,"I mean, there is so much wrong with this movie, and at the same time it has some things it does very well.
What's bad: the main story is given away in full in the first 5 minutes, no surprises; the movie really lacks subtlety, sometimes it introduces a good commentary (probably from the book) or an idea it drops it instantly and switches fast to something else; it does overexplain almost everything, first they show it to you, and then make sure to tell you what happened with words; most of the dialogue was cringe; none of the humorous parts worked for me, it just wasn't funny; the lighting was flat like in 70s TV shows (probably to make sure it's not too dark for a theater); some of the green screen effects were terrible; it's too long and the story's predictability made it even worse; it tried to focus on so many things altogether and it just didn't work; also, the world itself made no sense in some parts so I had to suspend my disbelief; it was so much less steampunk that I expected it to be; also, the casting was hit and miss, Hester and Thaddeus were great, while Tom was miscast and Chudleigh's accent just made me burst out laughing.
I appreciate the effort though.
Yet my main problem was that I actually was hooked by Hester/Shrike story and I wish this plot line had much more time put into it. Shrike design was cool and I really want to see a whole movie about her growing up with him. His struggle on realizing what he is and just how much humanity is left in him. The understanding that she cannot be with him, her guilt and the feeling that she owes him. Instead they just rushed through that part and when Shrike died at 1 hour 30 minutes the movie pretty much ended for me there. I knew everything that would follow so the next 20-30 minutes were tedious and boring.
What was good: most of the visuals were done good, some of them were even creative in some ways; Hera Hilmar is a beautiful woman and she was always a pleasure to look at.
Also, the doomsday weapon design kind of reminded me of old Red Alert games, when it opened up I instinctively said to myself: ""Be one, with Yuri...""
I wish they would split this into 2-3 movies, polishing all the side stories and delivering a truly satisfying ending.

Set in a steampunk dystopian future, ""Mortal Engines"" is a thrill ride that's got all the stuff movie magic is made of. Action, adventure, special effects, an underdog hero and an evil villain.The movie begins with a small city (on wheels) being chased by London (also on wheels) in the middle of a wasteland. Aboard the smaller city is a masked girl with bright eyes and a secret that you are just yearning to find out. Running the show in London is a calculating historian, named Thaddeus Valentine - but he is in search for more than just these renegade little cities in these little hunts that London is involved in. When the city is absorbed by London, the masked girl makes her move - attempting to assassinate Valentine. But her plan is thwarted - and she is tossed overboard along with a young man named Tom, who tries to stop the assassination. As these two journey together back to London, secrets are unveiled, a plot for global domination discovered, and a battle on an epic level is fought.This was a very good movie.

Director Christian Rivers was a storyboard artist/visual effects guy on the Lord of the Rings/Hobbit films, and he knows how build a world. The film contains a sort of cyberpunk-ish reality that combines the old and new. Everything from the technology to the clothing to even the natural environment feels completely distinctive. The giant tank-like city of London is something to behold. The opening where we're introduced to the place is such a breathtaking scene.The film also has an impressively designed secondary antagonist in the form of the disturbing and relentless Shrike, a cyber-zombie with a piercing voiceBefore I get into the plot, understand that the story and actors are decent, just not strong enough to sustain the 2 hour, 8 minute run time. The script is by Peter Jackson and his regular co-writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. Like King Kong and the Hobbit films, they don't realize less is more. Dialogue and some action scenes just go on a little too long. In fairness, the length gives the writers ample time to explain how this busy world works. Even then there are a couple script holes: a character figures out a plot point too quickly without enough plausible context and a supporting character just sort of vanishes once he served his purpose.The film unsuccessfully romantically pairs the two main characters Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) and Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan). It does a wonderful job of building a friendship and why they'd trust each other, but the love aspect is unbelievable. It happens too quickly, and they have no chemistry.Plot-wise the standout character is again Shrike. He has the most sympathetic story-line. In the pantheon of good villains from weak films, I hope Shrike ends up being remembered like the Darkness from Legend and not forgotten like Maximillian from the Black Hole.Despite it's clunkiness, I highly recommend you see this just for this experience.

I started imitating it: ""I'm going to the toilet, I'm opening the fridge"". Next, comes some of the worst over acting I've ever seen. At 1:42, a girl pulls out a knife from her clothing like it was King Arthur and the sword. I laughed again! Then, we move onto some terrible writing. Characters 'explain the script' in clunky dialogue while producing awful facial expressions. Thirty minutes in, I was so gutted that I spent £3 renting this pap, I came here to read some reviews. I'm glad to see I'm not the only one pointing out how bad this movie is. After thirty five minutes, I ejected the dvd, it was that bad. Life's too short to waste watching wooden acting with cardboard dialogue. How people can give this a 10 is also hilarious! To sum up, this is very badly acted and very badly written.

I'm not sure that was explained and if it was it was done poorly or at least it didn't interest me. The scenery and everything was good and that's basically the only pro. The acting was so-so and I never cared if a character died at all. I knew it'd be that way because right at the beginning someone nearly got assassinated. The man was stabbed in the stomach around a crowd of people yet somehow he was the only one to catch up to the assassin and the guy pursuing the assassin. Oh and then he basically never got any medical help for it he was just good. That's how you knew it'd be a bad movie and it was.

With direction by a neophyte with very little experience, as there were a dozen different occasions during this film where the lack of experience showed, esspecially during the actual action sequences which were completely disorganized, without any sort of rhythm, poorly choreographed and nearly incomprehensible. Eventually, I walked out I just couldn't take it anymore.The last 45 minutes of this film that I saw, was very very painful. There are better films out there that you can spend your money, rather than this live action cartoon. Granted, there were some special effects that were worthy, the concept was good and the story was interesting, but ultimately they just couldn't put it all together.",Mortal Engines
103,PyroSikTh,A Captivating World Used to Tell an Overtold Story,6,11 December 2018,"The single biggest lure to Mortal Engines is its concept, and the world it's set in. Over a thousand years from the present day, humanity is teetering on the brink of extinction. Cities and towns have been rebuilt as massive, roving machines, and they scour the land for resources to keep their citizens fed, and their engines burning. The smaller towns assemble makeshift trading posts, while the larger cities - like London - earn their way by literally gobbling up smaller towns. The film opens with such a hunt, as a small mining town finds itself pursued by the behemoth of London, eventually being unsuccessful and finding its population dragged into London. The town and its people's belongings are stripped and crushed for fuel, while London's historians frantically try and pick up every piece of meaningful ""ancient"" tech they can find.The world is expanded further after the two main characters, Tom and Hester, find themselves outside of London's walls, in the outlands. To the east lies Shan Guo, an Asian city built into the entrance of the Himalayas, with its own shield wall to fend off predatory cities like London. To the south there are roving bands of cannibal towns who barter in humans, either as food or for slavery. Above in the skies are flying city ports, home of the anti-tractionists - those against predatory cities. There's even a long-forgotten group of zombie cyborgs, immortalised in metal, but stripped of the memories of their past life, and employed as mercenaries and assassins. I mean the world that's hinted at in Mortal Engines is worth the price of admission alone.What does the movie do with this fascinating world? It tells us a teen-angst driven story we've seen a hundred times before in other Young Adult adaptations. Hester is an average-looking girl with a tragic past and out for revenge against one of London's leaders. Tom is a naive city boy who finds himself lost in the outlands and stuck with Hester. Naturally they fall in love after a couple of days together, as is befitting of this kind of movie. Meanwhile Hester's target, Valentine, is attempting to find a solution to the resources problem, which turns into something far more megalomaniacal and two-dimensional. Every so often the action cuts back to his daughter in London, attempting to uncover the truth of his plans. Ultimately she doesn't do anything other than present a pretty face.I hate to do this as well, but Mortal Engines is also another example of interesting, unique book endings completely rewritten for a more uplifting Hollywood ending. Unlike the books (which I haven't read), London remains intact, many dead characters survive to the end credits, and character roles are diminished so much that they ultimately don't matter any more. The entire theme of the book, including the source of it's title, is completely stripped out. I actually had to do some research to find out why on earth it was called Mortal Engines.That said, there are some interesting moments here. Hester's entire backstory is enthralling, and honestly would've made a better movie. The character of Shrike, and how he relates to Hester, is also fairly captivating despite going woefully underutilised. His introduction almost feels like a horror movie, and his death tugs at the heartstrings far more than it should. The potential behind the political struggles between predator cities and anti-tractionists is huge, but of course nothing much really comes of it. And of course both Hugo Weaving and Robert Sheehan are a delight to watch. Even though Weaving's character gets undercut by the cliché ending, he tears it up on screen nonetheless. I've also always held firm that Sheehan has a lot of potential as an actor, and Mortal Engines has not changed my mind on that. He was almost unrecognisable as Tom, and didn't skip a beat once.In all I give Mortal Engines an above average 6/10. The story and character work is sorely lacking, but the concept and glimmer of world-building, and how it's all brought to life with fantastic sets and CGI sequences meant I honestly didn't mind all that much. I strapped myself in for the ride, and enjoyed it all the way up to the end. I'm just disappointed that it really could have been a lot better. The groundwork was all there for something truly memorable. Ultimately there are worse ways to spend a couple of hours.",Mortal Engines

While on the other hand it has somewhat poor character development, pacing issues, overall not a particularly strong story and features one of the biggest cliches there can be..

The story and dialogue and pacing is bunk, but then again it always is in YA fiction adaptations, at least Mortal Engines has some spectacle and grandeur. The actors are uninspired and arcless with forced romances but that's par for the course for these films without the excellent world to draw from from Reece's novels. Sure it's saddled with the silly expository names of things we don't understand ""anti-Tractionists"" and ""Quantum weapons"" and it strains under the weight of too many storylines and a meaningless third act and some weightless flashbacks, but it's almost, almost good. I can see it peering through, and I had a very fun experience expecting the worst. Rivers' team probably did the heavy lifting, because as a director, he composes wonderful sequences with no heft and no attachment, the film is badly casted and character designs are cartoony and the music is desperately trying to do its best Lord of The Rings fan tribute. It's big, broad, colourful, Saturday morning cartoon fun with a big budget and a load of spirit, just not good chops in the right place; an actual director would have made the characters and the stakes pop a little more than just the massive machines and the battles.",Mortal Engines

You see one giant moving city but no scale compared to the trees it is crushing or the people on it and seconds later an even bigger city is introduced but again there's no build-up or suspense, it's just big from the start. The characters are annoying and obnoxious, except the main girl. The details of the story are muddled but the overall story is interesting. The parallels of the real world are painfully unsubtle.

109,stevenrotherforth,Beauty is only skin deep.,6,30 June 2019,"Mortal EnginesMortal Engines is a busy science fiction extravaganza with stunning visuals effects.
It borrows much from the likes of Mad Max, The Matrix, The Terminator, Star Wars and even a bit of Fantastic beasts.
Based on the novel by Philip Reeve that tells of giant mobile cities in a post apocalyptic world.
Mortal Engines is often impressive but sadly there's a tad too much going on to work as a two hour movie.
Perhaps developing this film into a mini series would have done Reeve's material more justice.
There's action a plenty but halfway through I found my attention wandering.
I think this due to the lack of cohesion in the storytelling.Performances are good, particularly Hera Hilmar in the lead as Hester Shaw and Robert Sheehan as her support who bares an uncanny resemblance to Eddie Redmayne.
Hugo Weaving does his usual splendid turn as villain but Mortal Engines ultimately just comes off as a mash up of imitations of better science fiction movies from the past.This film looks absolutely fantastic.
A near perfect 4K transfer with a crisp grain free digital image. Sound is equally impressive and makes a good demo disc for those into home theatre.
CGI is breathtaking and flawless. There's no hint of green screen even though practically every shot is a generated image.
Costume and set design is also superb and cinematography is beautiful to behold.
Sadly the beauty is only skin deep and as a movie in its entirety it doesn't quite work.
By no means a bad film but for all the CGI polish and awe inspiring imagery the final product is a touch...dare I say it?...Banal.",Mortal Engines
110,p-jonsson,I quite liked it actually,9,19 April 2019,"I have to say that I liked this movie a lot. It is kind of fantasy, science fiction (emphasis on fiction here) and steam punk (or perhaps I should say diesel punk) mixed together.The world is a fairly dark post apocalyptic world where moving predator cities prays on each other. The entire concept is really quite ridiculous of course but it makes for some really fantastic and spectacular special effects and I am a sucker for spectacular special effects.In addition the overall story holds together fairly well. That is, in the context of the ludicrous world that is the background of this story in the first place of course. It is quite straightforward without too much annoying social or green preaching that plagues so many movies nowadays. Somewhat predictable but overall a good vehicle for the plentiful action.I also liked most of the characters. Both the bad guy and the good guys had decent charisma with the exception of Tom who was a bit of a naive whiner although he got it together towards the end.There where few flaws. Nothing really major except that, in one scene at the end, the city of London was shown against the wall and it was bloody tiny compared to the wall. The main bad guy's last resort was to pummel London against the wall and was expected to break it down. Before in the movie London was depicted as really huge. That scene really screwed that and made him delusional.Apart from that, end Tom's whining and naivety, I really liked this movie. It was the kind of over the top, fantasy/fiction movie with a big budget that you do not see every day. Of course the dickwads, a.ka ""critics"") at Rotten Tomatoes and other mainstream media assholes did their best to tell everyone how bad it was. As usual that's just the stuff that comes out of the south end of a north bound bull.",Mortal Engines
111,Finfrosk86,Boy is this a mixed bag!,6,5 December 2018,"So way in the future, people live in big mechanical machines on wheels. And one of the bigger cities: London, has got some rather unsavory plans.Mortal Engines looks pretty good. The house-machines look awesome, especially the big ones. We are treated to some fine shots. Grandiose stuff. That's cool.
The action is alright, nothing too special, but at times it's quite exciting. There is one fight scene though and I gotta say: someone did NOT get the memo that we don't use a million cuts any more. But there isn't that much fighting anyway, so it's not a big problem. The action that's on a bigger scale is much better. The effects look good, except from some greenscreen stuff that will not age well. (remember that one scene in King Kong? Jeeesh)This movie really is a mixed bag. On one side it's got some creative, original ideas, on the other some overused clishees.
For every creative element, there's a cringy line or two.The characters are okay, can't say I liked anyone to a very big extent..Although Hugo Weaving does have some charisma.
What's with that Tom guy? Sorry, but I just didn't like his face. Reminded me of a ventriloquist dummy, or something. Dunno.Mortal Engines does have a cool atmosphere about it that I liked. But it is a little long, and there is especially one plot element that fell totally flat, although it was supposed to be very moving. It wasn't.All in all a decent movie, sure to entertain at least some people.",Mortal Engines
112,Magow-Intermean,Mortal Engines Review,9,24 March 2019,"In a post-apocalyptic future, mobile cities on huge caterpillar tracks roam the landscape, gobbling up smaller towns for their resources. Londoner Tom (Robert Sheehan) is proud of his home until he meets Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) and learns that London's hero Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving) may not be as upstanding as he thought.
As visual metaphors for capitalism go, the sight of a towering, mobile London running down and swallowing a smaller town is pretty compelling. The stripped world of Mortal Engines is dying, and humanity on the verge of extinction caused by its own hubris. And yet hubris still dominates, with each city convinced of its own manifest destiny to become the alpha predator in this world of ""municipal Darwinism"". It makes a compelling hook for this Peter Jackson-produced epic, but it's the setting for a fairly conventional adventure story.
The good news is that long-time Jackson collaborator and first-time director Christian Rivers keeps the action beats coming and the pace up. The story, based on Philip Reeve's book, has been neatly streamlined for the screen, keeping the emotional beats - even adding more for extra heft - but chopping out large swathes of unnecessary back and forth as our heroes struggle to figure out what's going on and eventually to stop a plot that threatens the whole planet. Someone, it seems, is trying to recover the weapons that once cracked the world's crust and set cities on the movie.
The world-building is as good as you'd expect from a Lord Of The Rings-trained director.
As young London historian Tom Natsworthy, Sheehan is a likeable lead, though the role is thankless. He's just a naïf caught up in larger events, giving others the chance to explain things to him and the audience. Far more interesting is Hester (Hilmar), the mysterious and masked girl who stabs a man without obvious provocation almost as soon as we meet her. Why she did so becomes a central plank of the film's plot. Hera Hilmar's an engaging presence even when snarling and desperate, and her unusual background and conflicted desires gives her a different feel to the identikit action women of other films.
If Hugo Weaving's Valentine cuts a largely familiar figure, there is a lot of welcome texture in the supporting cast, from Stephen Lang's terrifying Terminator-alike Shrike to Jihae's outrageously cool Anna Fang. And the world-building is as good as you'd expect from a Lord Of The Rings-trained director. From the metres-deep tracks that each city leaves behind to the Mad Max-esque scavengers who try to survive outside the city structures, there's a real sense of desperation and decay everywhere. Even in the towering London we spend more time in the rattling bowels of the city than in its towering heights (St Pauls tops the structure, dome and all still standing as it did through the Blitz).
The plot, however, remains a little predictable, and hits some distinctly Star Wars beats as it trundles towards its end. But there are moments of real grace along the way, and more thrilling adventure than you might expect, so it's a good start for Rivers and an effort worthy of Jackson's record.",Mortal Engines

So what's the point of saying it's from the same makers? Oh I see it's the same level of carp as those movies. LOTR should have been a mini-series on television. They filmed the entire 3 movies in one project. That's makes it a mini-series not a 3 movie cinecraptic release. The Hobbit equally as bad tries to cash in on that mini-series.

115,W011y4m5,Disappointing,6,4 April 2019,"So Peter Jackson adapted The Hobbit - which is a short story - into an entire trilogy & yet insisted on cramming Mortal Engines (which has at least an entire trilogy's worth of content) into just a two hour movie?
I'm sorry but the film drastically is in dire need of an extended cut which rivals Lord of The Rings: Return of The King in its runtime in order for this story to feel fleshed out & from being rushed... Being the length that it is just feels like the filmmakers are doing a genuine disservice to the source material they claimed to love so much & speak so passionately about in interviews & frankly, in their defense, it's clear why they were so enamoured with the novel because as an actual concept, Mortal Engines is absolutely genius & could've made for a groundbreaking, new, unique & original franchise for theatregoers to marvel at over the next few years but unfortunately the execution & exploration of the idea is seriously LACKING.
To acknowledge the positives - as it does thankfully have some; the production design is flawless, the cinematography is beautiful, the CGI & visuals are literally breathtaking & as a whole, the movie is technically very impressive with its remarkable world-building which has been depicted phenomenally in every frame of every shot but that doesn't negate the fact that the storytelling is poor, rushed & underdeveloped with a blatantly lacklustre script - which is surprising, considering who was involved in writing it.
ALSO, Robert Sheehan was TOTALLY, IRREVOCABLY miscast for the role of Tom - there's literally no on-screen chemistry whatsoever between him & the lead actress Hera Hilmar; the love story between the two of them is forced & unbelievable & (yet again) rushed & under-developed.
In summary / in conclusion, it's a real shame the film is as ""meh"" as it is but on the bright side, at least it's not terrible?",Mortal Engines
116,shawneofthedead,"Some of the best visual effects put on screen since Lord Of The Rings, but the muddled plot never quite lives up to its promise.",6,13 December 2018,"THE LOW-DOWN: For a period of time a decade or so ago, steampunk was all the rage in young-adult fantasy novels. 'Steampunk' novels blended past and future, taking inspiration for futuristic technology from the steam-powered machinery of the 19th century. Philip Reeve's Mortal Engines series is a prime example - his characters battle to survive in a broken future, in which people now live in moving, mechanical, almost monstrous cities. The original source novel (published in 2001) was adapted for the screen (and produced) by the same creative team behind The Lord Of The Rings: Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Peter Jackson.THE GOOD: The Mortal Engines features some of the best world construction (though it might be more accurate to say deconstruction) in a fantasy movie in a generation.The visual effects and production design - including a thoroughly reconstituted London and a city built on clouds - are fantastic, so remarkably rendered that it's impossible to tell where reality ends and imagination begins. Before they wear out their welcome, the characters are reasonably diverse and appealing: Icelandic actress Hera Hilmar adroitly finds the toughness and tenderness in driven protagonist Hester Shaw, and Hugo Weaving is so good as fairly one-note villain Thaddeus Valentine that you'll wish he had more layers to work with.THE CLEVERLY SUBVERSIVE: There's a clever thread of political commentary running throughout the film. As the predatory city of London storms smaller cities to steal their resources and energy, the obvious reference is to colonialism: our real-world history repeating itself in the form of fiction. There are even barely subtle allusions to some of the most bewildering policy decisions of our times: Brexit and Donald Trump's border separation initiative.THE NOT-SO-GOOD: The movie doesn't end half as well at it begins - it tries desperately to be exciting but winds up being exhausting. The final 45 minutes are packed with so many moving parts that most of the emotional beats get lost in the melee, including an actual 'Luke Skywalker vs. Darth Vader' moment that misses both the heart and the mark. It's nice that Jackson is mentoring Christian Rivers in the latter's directorial debut, but you might find yourself wondering what the film would be like if Jackson had directed it himself. Separately, Jihae cuts a cool figure as rebel leader Anna Fang, but she can't seem to express emotion through all of her character's swagger and glower.SCENE STEALER EXTRAORDINAIRE: Shrike - played in motion-capture by Stephen Lang - is a marvel. More machine than man, he steals pretty much every scene he stalks grimly through. Ironically (but also fittingly), this mechanical man's hunt for Hester lends the film most of its dramatic and emotional weight.WATCH OUT FOR: Cameos by Jackson and Reeve, if you're not too busy trying to keep track of everything that's going on.RECOMMENDED? If you want to see some of the best visual effects put on screen since Lord Of The Rings, yes. But the muddled plot never quite lives up to its promise. So be warned - you might be disappointed if you're in it for the story.",Mortal Engines

As it stands, it came across like a mix of 'Into The Badlands', 'Wild Wild West' and 'Terminator' - but with none of the best bits from any of them. Plot is that Hester Shaw (Hilmar) is trying to get vengeance against Valentine (Weaving) for killing her mum, and she's helped by Tom (Sheehan) & Anna (Jihae). The catch is it's 200 years in the post-apocalyptic future and most of the world's cities are giant mobile tanks, for some reason.A number of questions - why is the bad city/tank ""London""? Why did they turn bad? Why is an Australian (Weaving) playing a Brit? Why do two 30-year-old's find it so hard to kiss? Is that an American ""PG-13"" thing? How to the physics of the city/tanks work? Seems like they wouldn't be able to move anywhere near as fast as they do. Where does the fuel for the plane/blimps come from? Why are there Terminator-like resurrected cyborgs?Anyway, there's some nice visuals, but lots of too-fast camerawork and plenty of CGI, which is both good and bad. Both Hilmar and Sheehan are likeable. Not sure if the side plots with Kate & Bevis, or Shrike, were needed.

the thing is the movie was fine was not great but was above average and a must have for the fans of the fantasy - Action genre so what went wrong with the film ?
One reason is that it had to compete with lots of other popular titles.
Another reason is that it's nothing special if u are not a fanatic fan for this kind of genre.
The movie was strong had it's moments the concept of the future with attacking cities was a refreshing idea but the movie had also flaws.
we got a lot of.....star wars battle scenes in the last 30 minutes of the film and that did not helped but many protested that it was a kind of star wars rip-off at the end.
Anyways my review was for those of you who like those movies but due to the auful box office u did not went to watch this movie thinking it's bad.
If u like these stuff don't hesitate to give this movie a chance. I think u like it. it's not a bad movie but various reasons were the cause of it's failure in the theaters.

Let's get that part over first: there are at least two main elements that might make you think Star Wars near the end. They're somewhat similar but not really the same and play out differently in a very different setting with different components.So I thought the high concept of the movie - motorized cities rolling on land - might seem ridiculous, but I gotta admit it worked for me and made the movie feel fresh. That starting chase sequence between the two towns was original and memorable. There were other spectacular action sequences, including one involving buzzsaws, with great special effects, but I gotta admit the melee fights were weak as they were of the chaotic, frantic-cut variety, except perhaps those involving Shrike that were better. Regarding that undead cyborg Shrike, I loved pretty much everything about him: his look, the way he moved, his back story and his story arc. Probably my favorite character, but the others were interesting too, and the acting was solid overall.The production design was excellent with several fascinating cities and/or vehicles with a certain steampunk design vibe. Special mention to the location where the giant London tank threads passed. Visual effects were outstanding with sights you might never have seen before. Music was very good and appropriately grand when called for. I liked the story despite feeling a slight déjà-vu in the last part. This future world creation based on the novels was very well portrayed and captivating to me, and I wanted to learn more about it. Overall, the film was a very nice surprise, quite different than the usual sci-fi/fantasy blockbuster, at least in its setting. To be honest, until the last act I was going to recommend this film without any real reserves, but then it felt as if had to explain certain things.Rating: 8.5 out of 10 (Remarkable)",Mortal Engines
125,patriciogl10,Great for taking your mind off something.,7,30 October 2019,"Mortal Engines is a product met with pomp and show because of great visuals and small substance. The majority of viewers highlight the visual aspect of the film, because even objectively it is the best thing it has going for. The plot, while captivating, it doesn't live up to match the spectacularity of the visual artwork. It starts off as a very interesting concept, but it lacks sufficient explanation as to why everything happened and left humanity in its current state. As the movie progresses, the grade of interest begins to diminish because these characters, or better put, the portrayal of them is not good enough for viewers to get emotionally attached to them.It has interesting scenes, it's a joyful ride; I find that different people seem to take this one differently, so you have to be the judge for yourself.
However, if you're simply looking for a bit of action, fantasy, impressive visuals and a fun film, just immerse yourself in this story, chances are you might enjoy it.",Mortal Engines

127,austin0731,Mediocre remnant of the YA film genre,6,28 December 2018,"Mortal Engines sets out to be the next teen novel adaptation success story but fails miserably in establishing a new franchise. In many ways it represents the flaws of the genre and acts as a relic in this genre that is no longer able to draw in audiences like it used to.Mortal Engines looks amazing, it had an interesting premises that would draw audiences based on sheer curiosity factor but after that would have little to prove for itself. Beyond the visual appeal of the film and the interesting world building there is little character development and thus I found myself hardly caring about what happens to said characters. The film throws out terminology and characters like it is an established franchise in which audiences already understood what and who they are. The result was a film that hardly connected to its audience and an unbearable watch.I did find interest in one particular character, Shrike, a cyborg killer machine who was the most empathetic and garnered the most interest. Perhaps it had something to do with the focus they gave to the character's background and build.While Mortal Engines definitely failed in what it set out to do I wouldn't say that any of the performances or dialogue was horrible, it's simply mediocre and bland. Perhaps it is time to call it quits on these YA adaptations.",Mortal Engines

And we meet Hester Shaw, a young woman on a mission of revenge, to kill the man that killed her mommy, and that dude played by Agent Smith is Mr. Valentine a big deal in the mega city London. And just as she's about to complete her mission, some dude gets in the way named Tom, saves Valentine... however maybe Valentine isn't the hero he claims. Simply because Tom knows her name, Valentine pushes poor Tom overboard, where Hester happened to jump a moment before. The two team up for survival and well Tom now privy to Valentines true self is seeking answers, and along the way the truth about Hester's moms death.

130,anthonyjlangford,At least there's no superpowers,7,18 June 2019,Why Peter Jackson would allow a first time director behind something so large is perhaps the film's biggest question and greatest flaw. With a more experienced hand at the helm more character and emotion may have found it's way to the parts where it's clearly lacking.Otherwise its technology and action is quite fun to watch. It deserves some kudos for its bold ideas in trying something different on film. (Howls Moving Castle not withstanding). Surely it's preferential to have original stories rather than endless superhero stories and remakes. Even the new Star Wars Trilogy is essentially a remake of the originals. How will we set up the next generation of fantasy films if we don't take more risks?Unfortunately the producers took unnecessary ones when making this film.

We see city sized trucks running on fuel made by eating smaller trucks. It's ridiculous and insulting to the viewer.Well why not set the film in space, or on water. That would have been far more logical to fit the nonsense tech. Anyway. The characters are annoying and the film tries to make jokes that never land. The action is dull, and the music is incredibly over the top and dramatic.The plot is predictable and the acting is bog average.

135,scb_coldsteel,Great CGI but a complete mess of a film,4,8 April 2019,"So I rented Mortal Engines. I put off watching the movie just because the previews made the film look ridiculous in not the fun kind of way. After watching the film I have to agree. The fun premise and graphics just could not save this mess of a film.The plot of the movie combined a number of ideas from better sci-fi films and threw them in a blender. In a steampunk apocalyptic world gone wrong giant cities are used as moving battle castles as everyone fights for scarce resources. The film followed two walking cliches as they attempt to stop a surprise big bad guy from conquering the world via long lost technology. It's a bit like Waterworld meets Star Wars with a bit of Steamboy for good measure.While the plot wasn't exactly thought provoking the movie did have it's strengths. The CGI was very well done and the copy and paste world was actually quite interesting. Seeing a giant city attack something was just as ridiculous and satisfying as expected. Plus I was actually interested in the world building and the well designed and diverse settings. If the film embraced its absurd concept and tried to be an all out fun sci-fi ride this could have been an enjoyable experience.Unfortunately Mortal Engine decided to go the Eragon and Golden Compass route for a book adaptation. Spend a lot of money on CGI, but burn any interesting aspects to the ground with a bad screenplay and lazy directing. The film's plot was quite simply boring and predictable. The special effects could not save the film from lazy plot devices and terrible dialogue. The ideas behind the film were simple and regurgitated, but they were also presented in a overly convoluted manner that really slowed the plots progression down. The rookie director definitely showed here as their were far too many examples of an inexperienced hand at the helm.Every aspect of the movie felt so very generic and meaningless. The movie made this world, but populated it with walking set pieces that were completely unlikable. There was not an original character in the film in any way. If the acting was better this may have been forgivable, but unfortunately there was only one actor carying the entire film. Hugo Weaving could only do so much with his character. It was a tough sell asking the audience to care about the film when the screenplay hardly cared about its characters.Despite a fun and silly concept the actual action was quite bland. A movie like this could drop the ball on plot progression and action if the action and pacing could make the ride enjoyable. Mindless fun is still fun at the end of the day. Mortal Engine dragged on at a snail's pace so when the action occurred I just didn't care. Even when the action happened it seemed sloppy and poorly done. How did the movie manage to make cyborgs, steampunk cities, flying ships, and laser cannons boring?I really wanted to like Mortal Engine because of the CGI and the interesting setting. The movie did have quite a bit of potential, but its execution left too much to be desired for. I can't say I had fun while watching the movie at all. I was too busy wondering why the director made so many poor choices to enjoy the ride. Ultimately Mortal Engines was just another example of a failed literary adaptation when studios try to make style over substance. A 4.25 out of 10.",Mortal Engines

142,ivko,"the problem with ""from the people that brought you...""",5,26 March 2019,"Since it's splashed all over the promotional material, just about anyone who's seen this movie knows that it was made by some of the same people that made the LotR and Hobbit movies. Obviously the idea was to imply that this movie had some of the same magic as those franchises, but really this movie isn't even remotely in the same league.Unfortunately, this kind of thing isn't terribly unusual in the movie industry. I think the thinking goes like this: ""Well, there's this other story and the movie based on it was really successful, so let's borrow all of the same themes and basic ideas, update the parts we think are outdated, and make piles of money.""So, let's see how they did. Threat to the world from an ancient power? Check. Some object that needs to be brought to the ancient threat to destroy it forever? Check. Noble warriors to facilitate the heroes journey? Last of a race of powerful creatures disappearing from the world forever? Huge, sweeping battle where evil is about to triumph until at the last second the hero completes their quest? Check, check, and check.And yet, despite clearly following the same basic recipe, the movie doesn't really work very well. Nor did it make big stacks of cash; in fact, I believe it actually lost tens of millions of dollars. So what went wrong?Well, in a nut shell the same thing that always goes wrong when the movie industry tries something like this: they only got the parts of the movie they actually understand correct and screwed up the rest. Specifically, the industry understands the visual side of movies. The sets, the actors, etc. Those parts of this movie work quite well. The movie is really very beautiful.But the plot is very meh. There are plot holes galore that pulled me out of the story constantly and despite a fairly long running time, many of the characters feel extremely one-dimensional and uninteresting. Even the romance feels half-baked., The two leads meet, travel together for maybe two days, and then declare themselves in love. It doesn't feel organic; it feels more like someone said ""hey, people like romance, add some romance to the story.""The bottom line is looking cool won't stop me from wondering why building massive tanks that carry entire cities on their back and hunting other cities is more efficient than cultivating crops and livestock, or why they think Twinkies will last for literally a thousand years, or why they can build floating cities but they stock their armories with medieval weapons like swords and halberds, or why they can manufacture munitions but not missiles, or--well, you get it.With a budget of $100 million, I'm sure the studio was hoping to develop its own IP they could turn into a string of movies.

Apparently ""young adult"" based on the novel from which it's very, very loosely adapted, but the leads are 30 years old, and why would someone who enjoyed the books want to watch them be butchered so badly?We can skip over the nonsensical cyber-steam technology: it's magic. Just accept that. The styling is decent enough, but it lacks the real panache of something like Girl Genius. and they can't decide if it's swords and grappling hooks, or blasters and proton torpedoes. Also, the wise and benevolent Orient begins somewhere around Poland now, because jumble mumble tectonic shifts. I guess. Ignore it and move on.What we can't ignore is that, apart from the reliable Hugo Weaving, the acting is pretty dire. The cheap cast of unknowns are unknown because they have no screen presence or range, and the two leads have zero, absolutely zero chemistry.Hera Himer is minimally competent, but Robert Sheehan plays Tom Tiddlywinks as a thoroughly useless and unlikable Lukewarm Skywalker. The obligatorily diverse supporting cast have nothing to work with, and Jihae in particular is about as talented and appealing as a gender non-binary Yoko Ono. Accents are all over the place, more or less random, and occasionally completely cringe-worthy. Frankie Adams browning it up as ""Yasmina Rashid"" is simply appalling and should have been cut for her sake as well as ours.The visuals are decent enough, but nothing special these days. Visuals weren't enough to save John Carter, Jupiter Ascendant, or Valerian, and they're not nearly enough here.So what are we left with? An over-blown score with no consistent theme. Some irrelevant side-characters who just get forgotten about half way through. In fact, an entire civilian population that just vanishes from the screen so as remove moral complexity for our heroes. Decent enough direction and editing, to be fair: the action scenes are at least coherent.Script? They thew away the books and essentially just ripped off Star Wars IV to VI. I mean, painfully blatantly. Garbage disposals, trench runs, aim for the power regulator on the north tower, I am your father, I won't fight you, the whole lot.And like Episode 4 this is a B-movie full of Z-listers with effects that try to cover that up.

149,gcsman,"Not quite epic status, but a great film to watch on a lazy Saturday afternoon",7,13 February 2021,"Director Peter Jackson and his marvellous New Zealand crew of staff are back to take a turn at putting this Philip Reeve YA novel onto the screen. It's a far-future dystopian techno fantasy (if it were set in the past you could call it 'steam punk' for its general feel). Ancient, unmoored cities now rove across dead landscapes constantly searching for food and materials while the world at large stares into an empty future. It's a bleak picture redeemed only by the hope of youth.And it has a good crew of mostly-young and less familiar actors, with the only prominent big name being Hugo Weaving, delivering the main villain's role in this case. But Hera Hilmar and Robert Sheehan (Icelandic and Irish respectively) make an attractive pair of leads and really throw themselves into the many action scenes that propel the plot. I'd be happy to see them again. I also liked Jihae Kim and Leila George. Stephen Lang, a veteran character actor, is almost unrecognizable as the golem-like Shrike. It's a very strange role and could be seen as no more than a distraction, but Lang sells it and the whole texture of the film ends up richer for it.It feels like Jackson was trying to recapture the epic stature of his unrivalled LOTR series, following the classic approach of taking a big-scale fantasy world with a 'quest' theme and making it personal by focussing down on just a few characters. But despite lots of good elements including the acting and cinematography, it just doesn't quite make it over that bar. Maybe that's not a criticism though. (If you don't quite measure up to the supreme high-water mark of all fantasy films, is that really a bad thing? The LOTR movies were a flat-out miracle. Mortal Engines by comparison is just -- pretty good.) All in all, I think it makes a great movie for a lazy Saturday afternoon.",Mortal Engines
150,lucasnochez,Film Review: Mortal Engines/www.nightfilmreviews.com,1,26 December 2018,"The latest contrivance from Peter Jackson, Mortal Engines is a post-apocalyptic action thriller on wheels. The film was penned and produced by Jackson with newcomer Christian Rivers making his feature film directorial debut under Jackson's wing. The concept of Mortal Engines is set thousands of years ahead of our time. After what was known of the ""Sixty Minute War"", the Earth's crust has shattered resulting in a large loss of the earth's surface area and natural resources. The loss of resources is the main motivating factor behind entire cities transforming their societies into moving war machines. Their only goal; strategizing towards conquering one another for resources. These concepts do not stray far from our own political climate in its current state. The amped up and glamorized special effects make these concepts of moving beasts of cities a fantastic steam-punk fuelled spectacle that gets your gears going.The story of Mortal Engines centres around a young apprenticing historian Tom Natsworthy played by Robert Sheehan. The young aspiring aviator unwillingly becomes involved in the attempted murder of the main monopolizing figure of London and Head of Guild of Historians, Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving). The would-be assassin, Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar), is a masked and mysterious femme fatale figure with some of the new world's darkest and deepest secrets. After being mostly unsuccessful with her assassination attempt, no thanks to Tom, Hester and Tom find themselves exiled off of London and into the Great Hunting Ground. Left to face the bleak landscape of the new destructed world alone, a world that director Rivers and the set designer Rosie Guthrie decorate with numerous memorable cinematic set pieces, including a southern bayou style encampment vehicle that rolls and crawls through the landscape with clay formations on its back resembling armour similar to something you would see on an ancient dinosaur or armadillo.After being captured and sold as slaves, Hester and Tom are lucky enough to be saved by top world assassin Anna Fang. Korean pop star and actress Jihae plays Fang, pilot and leader of the anti-establishment force known as the ""anti-tractionists"" who oppose the mobilization of cities and subsequent warfare that comes with the capitalist nature of it all. Opposing the idea of what the predator cities adopt as ""Municipal Darwinism"", Fang steals Hester and Tom as well as the slave market scene from the movie commanding attention. Donning a red leather trench coat tat resembles something out of a colourful parallel world Matrix, Fang saves our main protagonists without a hair falling out-of-place from her Presley style pompadour. this among many others scenes in the film are hard to ignore for its blatent yet often times crazy imitation type scenes. Typically, while films with this type of budget and nature, tend to pay great tribute and homage to some of the films it get inspiration film, Mortal Engine tends to spill a little too much grease on its mirroring scenes.In addition to this array of fresh new faces of actors, the supporting cast also includes Leila George D'Onofrio, playing Katherine Valentine, Thaddeus Valentine's daughter and at least in portions of the film seeming love interest to Tom. Stephen Lang plays the role of Shrike, a Metal Gear Solid styled undead soldier from a battalion called The Stalkers. While Shrike is made mostly of metal and being undead, Shrike and Hester provide the film with the most emotional parts of the film and perhaps the film's best subplot, Lang and Hilmar give the majority of the film its beating heart, no matter ow cold the subject material really is.While Mortal Engines will be a hard sell in a jam-packed holiday schedule of films, this dystopian future feature film does some provide audiences with amusing portrayals of the future. Both Rivers and Jackson create a world that is both terrifying to imagine, yet fascinating and hard to look away from. Although the film tries a little too hard on being a Mad Max imitation the film is peppered with popular culture references touching on everything from minions, to Apple products (specifically iPhones) and toasters; displayed and spoken about as if they were ancient relics that providing us humans with some essential and crucial nourishment. One of my favourite and probably the most humorous scenes in the film was when we see Esther pull out a Twinkie to eat. Tom makes a remark at how old the Twinkie is and in a cheeky jab towards the food industry, she diffuses his worries by claiming food from the past even if it is a thousand years old in their case of story and time, ""never goes bad"".Ultimately, even with some structural voids in the story and certain points where the plot loses the wind in its sails, Mortal Engines does its best job at being overtly entertaining. Its portrayal of a distant future was surprisingly humorous and time dwindling in the realm of apocalyptic filmmaking.",Mortal Engines

The smaller ones are hunted by a giant predator city ready to consume it for resources, whilst a mysterious young woman seeks revenge on Hugo Weaving's conniving villain. We quickly get introduced to this futuristic fantasy and its welcome steampunk aesthetic, with many great touches to production design that embrace the retro-futurism its setting affords.However, after the first act, 'Mortal Engines' slowly devolves into mediocrity, which is particularly evident in its dull third act - an action-heavy finale that lacks creativity and directorial finesse the script desperately needed. There's a lot going on plot-wise in the film, but you can't help but think it's all a bit narratively congested; a TV series would have been able to better flesh out the characters and concepts without feeling like a rush to the finish.The supporting characters are expendable, the visuals are inconsistent (some scenes are jaw-dropping, whilst others are green screen heavy), and, ultimately, this fantasy adventure runs out of steam in the home stretch; which is a shame, because it has the ingredients to be a terrific blockbuster. In the end though, it feels like many of the concepts were underutilised.6/10",Mortal Engines
158,elenaphysics,"Decent film, full of action BUT..",7,4 April 2019,"Ok this film is interesting to watch.It has action,it is not gory, but there is a mess..
I didn't understand at first the machines destroyed the world in 60min (Terminator,the rise of the machines) and now the world is all empty except from some moving cities which collect metals to fuel their machines which are all old tech. And they hate the others who oppose traction? (as if traction is something to be opposed to).
The girl Esther Shaw runs away from the maniac who killed her mother and tried to kill her. Then she bumbs into a robo-zombie who raises her as his daughter.
The robo-zombie wants to kill her and make her a robo-zombie herself so she runs away and broke her promise of becoming a robo-zombie.
So he hunts her everywhere.And he is everywhere.
There was an old Carl Barks comics story then retold by Don Rosa about a zombie that followed Scroodge Mac Duck everywhere, that is what this reminded me of. A zombie going everywhere,how the hell did he manage to go to Airhaven? And how the hell did he destroy it?I mean it is absurd.
At the end we have a moment where Valentine tells Esther ""Luke I am your father"" .We don't know for a fact that he was her father or if he made that up to save himself..
There is a ton of plot holes. The movie is absurd.But it is fun to watch.I do not intend to rewatch it. But I am not that disappointed. But to be honest I haven't read the book so I did not have any high expectations. I have noticed that people who actually read the book are disappointed. The movie has great CGI and the characters are interesting. Do not expect to watch a masterpiece. But it is good",Mortal Engines

All they did was change the venue of other movies and shuffled the back stories a bit to make it a new movie. This is literally Terminator 2 meats Star Wars episodes 4 & 5.I dont know why someone okayed this. Its really somewhat insulting given the originals were 10x better. The effects were not any better than the old movies and the drama no where near as compelling since it crammed to much into 1 movie. Its just action scene after actions scene whereas the originals used a lot of time to build characters and create tension.Skip it. Yea I give it a 4/10 which is not horrible, but you will be far more satisfied by (re)watching Terminator 2 and the original Star Wars trilogy. This offers nothing by comparison.",Mortal Engines
161,Sankari_Suomi,Well presented stieselpunk aesthetic in a post-apocalyptic setting,7,26 January 2019,"It's the future, and everything's gone to hell! 1,000 years ago there was some kind of world war that wiped out pretty much everything within the space of 60 minutes, and reshaped the entire globe by smashing most of its continents. Oh noes!Human civilisation has been reduced to a fragile existence amidst a steampunk world with a hint of dieselpunk. So... stieselpunk?Cities and towns across Europe now exist as mobile fortresses, battling each other for dwindling resources. London is the biggest of them all: a super-predator that literally devours smaller settlements.But what about Washington DC? Well as far as I can tell the USA has been completely destroyed, so that's a refreshing and highly welcome development.Meanwhile, everyone who can be loosely classified under the generously broad umbrella of 'Asian' lives in a rich, peaceful, and well established nation behind the safety of a giant wall. Hmmm...Anyway, there's this girl who hates Hugo Weaving because he killed her mother, although it looks like he's her father(?!) which for some strange reason she doesn't realise until she's about to kill him, so that makes it all a bit awkward in a Star Wars-y kind of way.Her mother gave her the MacGuffin that everyone spends most of the movie looking for, but the plot won't let her know what it is until the last 10 minutes, despite the fact that the one guy she's been running around with all this time had worked it out in the first half hour.Unusually, Mortal Engines is more accurate than the book it's based on (a rare occurrence) which came as a pleasant surprise.Is it worth watching? Absolutely. The aesthetic is gorgeous, the costumes are superb, the special effects are on point, Hugo Weaving chews scenery with tremendous gusto, and the world building is solid.I rate Mortal Engines at 23.31 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a respectable 7/10 on IMDB.",Mortal Engines

164,tinovalkki,Visually stunning,6,9 December 2018,"Mortal Engines is visually stunning movie. Therefore is pity, it's script is lame and predictive. If visuality is enough and you can live with b-class script, then Mortal Engines is made for you. I was watching this movie in IMAX and it's visual look in 3D is stunning. Movie looks and sound great, but the story won't surprise you. None of the roles don't underlay enough, so it is hard to choose who to follow, who is good and who is bad. The script is so cliche that you can almost know every characters next reply. The end of the movie is like straight from Star Wars. ""I am your father"" tells everything and really won't surprise you at all.Visually movie is stunning with all the particulars. 3D works great and camera movement is brilliant. If you like visual fantasy movie, it looks beautiful, even the story is so light and won't offer almost anything to an adult viewer. Personages are boring and empty. Surprisingly most human in the whole movie is supporting character machine man.If you don't bother about cliche and predictable story, Mortal Engines is quite satisfying cyberpunk dystopia. It is best to see from big silver screen in 3D.",Mortal Engines

But what are they building?We do get a beautiful portrayal of a world where steam punk meets Mad Max and I was pleasantly reminded of the film Stardust. I also liked Shrike; the resurrected man-machine. But the story rambles about in an unfocused mess. I don't mind films where you have to figure out what is happening as it unfolds but I hate it when explanations are late and rushed. I don't mind stories where important characters are introduced late on but here they were still being thrown at us nine tenths of the way in.The same screen writers did The Lord of the Rings (2001) - they got that right but this one so wrong. Maybe it was because they were allowed to mess with this story. And while I have writer's attention: can we please stop having dumb USB kill switches for mega weapons?

I saw the trailer and it trick me to make me think it was good,but, here is the real problem.I had gone to the A.m.c. multiplex ,where I live, to see the real D 3D version .When the trailers started the announcer told every to put their glasses on ,so I did.What happened? the trailers remained 2d and the ratio projection was zoom down below the Panavison ratio screen and the image was a bit dark.I said to my self what is going on.Are theater owners trying to destroy 3D again,like they did in fifties with sloppy projections,? idiots were looking at 2d with 3D glasses.Then I felt that maybe when the movie starts it will become double images,but, as soon as the universal insignia came on,the image remained 2D, dark and small image.I immediately ran out and went to the manager and told him the problem.He then went up to the projection booth and checked it.He came back down and and told me that the problem was fixed. Well, when I went back the image was now the size of the Panavision screen and the image double ,but, when I put my 3D glasses on the polarize lens would not block the light thus still doubled.The idiotic audience were watching this with their glasses on.I ran back to the manager and told him the problems.He went into the auditorium and saw it.He went back to the projection booth. I waited and waited and waited.He finally came down and told me that the Polaroid filter was broken.I was disappointed .The good new was that he was going to offer me and the audience a refund after the show.Which was a good value cause I was now watching a 2D made movie ,not a 3d made any how except for the conversion,for free.If it was not for me no body would have gotten a refund.That audience was apathetic.I still had trouble enjoying it ,not only because of the stress that I had experience,but also because it was not good 2D or 3D.It was almost as bad as Cat women on the moon and Robot monster in big budget style.Peter Jackson has done better .The 3D trilogy of Lord of the Rings ,actually shot in 3D too. If the manger had checked the projector the night before,when the theater closed and had a supply of Polaroid lenses,the problem would not have occurred the next day.The only good thing about this film are the set ,characters,except for the boy and girl cause they had not much motivation in their character.If you loved seeing on late t.v. the flat version of Robot monster,then ,you won't have any problems with this. 12/16/18",Mortal Engines
168,MongoLloyd,Beautiful visuals with disgusting social commentary.,1,1 February 2021,"The underlying story of a girl given new life by an autistic robot-man, seeking revenge against the megalomaniac who murdered her mother would have sufficed on its own. But the filmmakers chose to foist an obviously contrived, not so subtle social commentary on the audience in the form of the underdog saviors of the story's heroine who all happen to be non white. Then the story veers into ""peaceful brown and yellow people Vs the evil white people"" and well away from the initial pursuit of a bad man by a wronged girl, story.The juxtaposition is indeed striking. We are shown multiple scenes of the nearly all white Londoners gleefully cheering for the ingestion of a lesser city and similarly gleefully clapping and cheering for the destruction of the praying, benevolent yellow and brown people. When one takes into account the very deliberate aspect of filmmaking that is casting, you have to assume none of this was accidental.",Mortal Engines

Besides, they also mentioned Peter Jackson, which led me to believe that the quality of the movie would be no less than the one of LOTR trilogy. How wrong was I. The books in my opinion aren't good. The characters are more annoying than anything else. You just don't feel any empathy towards anyone. The characters in the movie even worse. The scenario, which is different than the one in the books, is bad. So bad in fact that, the books now seem like a masterpiece. While watching this move, you feel like they took some amazing effects and setting, and still you just want it to be over with. The story and characters background aren't explained enough. In short amazing visuals, bad everything else. I hope that someone would take this amazing steampunk setting and make a good post-apocalyptic movie we want (Fallout series as example).",Mortal Engines
170,scottmannen1,Slightly Better Than Average Entertainment,6,16 June 2019,"Greetings friends!This is the kind of movie to watch on a Saturday evening when you are looking to watch something entertaining. It delivers on a slightly better than average level of entertainment providing lots of good CGI, but with a story that is over the top unrealistic and acting that is acceptable. This kind of movie is the type to watch when you are looking for entertainment that has some decent action sequences and not a lot of intelligent story. Basically the writing isn't all that good, the story is poorly converted from the novel cutting a few too many corners to the point that the story is a bit of a discombobulated mess.If you are looking for a deep movie with rich realism and thought provoking narrative then you have most certainly come to the wrong place. This is definitely a ""one watch wonder"" meaning that after you see this movie you will quite literally have no desire to ever watch it again. Great movies are ones that you find yourself thinking about for days after having had watched it. This movie is unfortunately all together forgettable. It's clear they spent a ton of money on this flick and the6 definitely did not make any profit off of this one!The casting selection was very well done having had selected experienced actors who more or less played their parts to the best of their abilities. Some of the most interesting characters were on screen and killed off as fast as they were introduced. The Shrike was a fer6 interesting undead cyborg character that they actually gave spent a good amount of time fleshing out his character and his history quite well, which makes me wonder why they spent all that time building up his back story in the movie if he was to just have been killed off after only a few scenes. That was a major screw up for sure. Apparently his in book character is much better and his story arc is played out properly. The Chinese woman who played a supporting character role for @ good part of the film was done in the exact opposite fashion. Zero backstory for her leaving the viewer asking themselves who is this person, why is she a big part of the film if we don't know who she is?Indeed these massive character flaws are not the fault of the actors; rather, they are the victims of poor writing. So, in conclusion I would not have wanted to spend any money to watch this film in the theatres. This is one to watch after it shows up on Netflix or another streaming platform to watch when you are bored looking for some mindless entertainment. The entire concept of this movie is very unrealistic and far reaching to the point that it's borderline ridiculous! Rolling cities on wheels? Flying cities in the clouds? It's absurd, unbelievable and altogether over the top!",Mortal Engines

175,paulijcalderon,Like-able main duo stuck in chaotic ride,6,9 December 2018,"Peter Jackson & company are insanely talented at creating their worlds. What I liked most about ""The Mortal Engines"" is how the opening scene makes you understand the concept without too much explanation. With a high-paced sequence that very well established where the characters are at and how this world of ""cities on wheels"" is supposed to work. It felt promising and I got a ""Howl's Moving Castle"" meets ""Mad Max"" sort of vibe. If only the execution held up all the way through. Peter Jackson probably should have directed on his own. Instead he let's his pal Christian Rivers take the helm based on Jackson's script and producing duties. I feel there are plenty of missed opportunities and rushed plot ideas thrown your way. Few important moments get the time they need to sink in and it's like they had no patience to get to the stunning set-pieces. Most of the turning points happen so suddenly that it's though for you to stay up to speed with the story. It doesn't help when your villain is super cliche either. The camera work also appeared slightly unfocused. One second there's a beautiful vista, then the next second we're shaking all over the place as people are fighting in claustrophobic rooms. I couldn't tell what was happening during most fights.I wanna be positive with some aspects. Firstly, I liked the main characters. A very like-able duo played by relatively fresh newcomers. Hester's arc had a good concept. Imagine that the goal of your life has been revenge, and that you have been raised by a robot to show no emotion. So therefore once she meets the funny and lighthearted Tom - who has lived safely without danger - she has no idea how to express compassion. These two had things to learn from each other and that gave the story a nice meaning. It's also funny how this movie mixes genres. It's science fiction, but it's told as a fantasy and I guess there's some steampunk and... dear I say Anime influences to be seen? You get imagery that would lend itself perfectly in a ""Nausicaä / Studio Ghibli"" type movie or any Anime in general. It has that same level of detailing concepts of worlds beyond ours. The bottom line is that I thought it was a messy/chaotic ride with some fun sprinkled across. Jackson and company can do so much better. Mostly recommended to an audience who love science fiction stories that are really out there. I'm still waiting to see more ""Tintin"" films.",Mortal Engines

177,gerry_barnaby,Brilliant film based on the one of five books,10,8 December 2018,"I went into this with fresh eyes and wasn't expect much, DAMN!!!! This is was incredible with a great pace, good direction and amazing acting. It like a cross between steampunk theme with the cities and small towns and a little terminator with the character strike, who seriously creepy and frightening.After watching this film I realised the film is actually one of five books entitled Mortal engines which has just come out in the cinema, brilliant film is it the other books entitled Predator gold, infernal devices, a darkling plain and night flights all apart of a continuous story. After watching this I hope the other book made into a film as well because this style of sci-fi is what the cinema needs more of.This was a simple epic storyline that doesn't have that stupid political agenda crap that most films have just lately, it refreshing to see a film like this as it follows a story of a world on the brink of extinction where people live in mechanical moving towns and cities in a steampunk style universe, which make this film brilliantly done. Especial the beautiful stunning visuals and epic inspiring moments that combine this film in a great storytelling, great acting really brings this film to life.It has been a long time since ive seen a true sci-fi film actually work, especial something written from a book is very rare to be this good, though I never actually read the books so I could really tell you if it close to the book, what I can say is the film is amazingly adapted from book to film.I love strike character which is a shame he not in the film for long but when hes on screen his presence is very frightening, with a terminator style concept voiced by the one and only Stephen Lang. All the cast from Hera Hilmar (Hester Shaw) on a path of vengeance, Robert Sheehan (Tom Natsworthy), Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), Katherine Valentine (Leila George). all the other cast have done a brilliant performance through the film.If you into the steampunk, sci-fi type of films, your gonna love this film, it's a film I highly recommend watching on the big screen, hopefully, it gets a sequel from the next books like maze runner films.Dislikes: Slighty pacing issue and the story is predictable but its forgivable with a great story.",Mortal Engines
178,mbhgkmsgg,Mortal Engines,7,10 December 2020,"Mortal Engines is very average when it comes to the story. Visually, however, it is stunning. The concept, which it borrows from the book it is based on, is interesting as well, and the movie executes that concept very well.This film is exactly what you'd expect. The story, which I assume is relatively closely related to the source material, is very, very basic. It hits all the boxes that a story like this needs to hit. And when I say every box, I really mean every box. Every cliche that you can come up with is in Mortal Engines. It never tries to hide them, and they arrive exactly when you'd expect. In that sense, the film is a little disappointing. With a world as spectacular as the one in Mortal Engines, I feel like the film could've taken some risks. As such, I feel like the best way to describe this film is as safe. As I mentioned, it checks every box and has every trope that this kind of story arc usually has. And while it is boring and unimaginative, there is a reason why this type of plot and style of storytelling is so popular, it works. It offers heroics, moments of sorrow, and an ultimately satisfying conclusion.While the story might feel extremely familiar, the world certainly doesn't. Indeed, the world in Mortal Engines is stunning. It's easily one of the most imaginative and original fantasy worlds that I have seen in recent years. Having never read the source material, I can't comment on how accurate the representation in the film is. Nor can I give the film credit for coming up with such a fantastic concept. However, what I can give it credit for, is executing both the world and the concept, extremely well.
The way we get to experience this world is through the eyes of Hester, a woman on the quest for revenge, and Tom, a man unsure of who he is. Together they end up travelling the world, as well as becoming responsible for saving it, exactly as you'd expect. Although there isn't much there, it's entertaining enough for a movie like this.Now, I do have to admit that I tend to rate visually stunning films higher than I probably should. I love movies that have beautiful and interesting worlds that are showcased well. And if Mortal Engines doesn't do anything else, it does that very well. What's more, I felt like this movie only scratched the surface. Every time a new city, or place is introduced, there is so much to see and explore. Even though this movie is restricted to really only a couple of locations, I felt like even those locations had so much more to offer. And everything I did get to see, I really liked. It's quite unfortunate that the film is, at best, mediocre otherwise. There seems to be endless potential in the world of Mortal Engines, and it really is quite unfortunate that there apparently won't be a sequel. And thruthfully, there probably shouldn't be one. This first entry, although fantastic in many ways, is ultimately underwhelming. The story leaves a lot to be desired, and even the brilliant worldbuilding can't save it.Having heard nothing but bad or average things about Mortal Engines, I wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. Is it a great film? No. But it's good enough for what it is. I do have a bias for visually pleasing films, and that's at least partly the reason why I enjoyed what is otherwise a very average movie. Although it does nothing wrong, it feels like it doesn't do much of anything else either. Mortal Engines played it too safe, and accordingly, the final result feels somewhat uninspired.",Mortal Engines

Literally the first time I saw the interaction between the main villain and the main protagonist, I could tell they were related. It's as though they stitched this story together with material from other movies.It is so predictable that it's actually laughable. You'd think that in such a rich world, there'd be a lot of depth, but it's as shallow as a pool of spit.The only good things about this movie was the visuals. Splendid visual effects actually. The story between Shrike and Hester was pretty good too, and if they focused more on that, I'd almost give it a 7/10.I give it a 6/10 purely because of the visuals. The story is not innovative, it's trying to be something it's not and that's why it fails to deliver.

Jupiter Rising

Cowboys and AliensAnd yet, to add Mortal Wheels to the above celluloid nightmares would be a compliment, because it's far, far worse than anyone could ever possibly imagine. To better understand, call to mind the most sentimentally syruppy, cringy scene of all the Hobbit Movies: the Hobbits cleaning up after the big meal, singing saccharine jubilee, while throwing plates and pans and cups in the most egregiously impossible way. The opposite of Stanley Kubrick. Now combine this with Jar-Jar Binks, ""me so happy!"" And you will arrive at entire basic import of Mortal Engines. Why, why does the collapsing cities have Lord of the Rings buildings, homes and every other structure? In no way imaginable would such a technical feat be realized. Nothing makes sense. And it's so, so boring. So incredibly boring. I could feel myself aging, getting fatter even, as the movie progressed. My carpel tunnel even got triggered. This movie means Peter Jackson isn't who we thought he was. Admit it, were you not bored to death during most of the Lord of the Rings. Sure, you wanted to love it. I understand. But in the final analysis, the three movies as whole were bloated, absurdly and toxically racine. Honestly, did anyone truly and authentically cheer, deep down, when Gandolf lit the fireworks in the Shire, puffed on his magic pipe and coddled the Hobbits to his bosom? Time to boycott Jackson.

183,evan_harvey,Great film. Ambitious. Pace is a bit rushed.,8,7 December 2018,"Great film. Never heard of it before. Really enjoyed it. Haven't read the books.To be honest, going into films cold is great. If it turns out that you don't like it, chances it doesn't really make any difference; you wouldn't have liked it anyway. It also means that if you do like the film, it's even better. As it was, I really liked the film. Here's the skinny:Great SFX. Everything looked amazing. No cheap CGI to be seen here. Some gorgeous scenes and good sets.Story: requires a suspension of disbelief, plus it's a bit of an odd concept. Cities cruising around? Well, okay, if you say so. But once you deal with that, it's good to go. I also liked the little details; it's clearly a well-thought out world, at least at the city level. Good stuff. Great details in the background of what's going on.The plot: Some familiar concepts, but well done. Interesting and different. The film felt really rushed (pace-wise), like they had a film and a half's worth of story, but decided that they could realistically only do one film. That's a fair decision to make for any film that's not Marvel (which is a whole nother side of the story - Marvel has been great, but combined with Netflix it's completely killed cinema). So it packs a lot in, and the film suffers a little from it. There's lots of things that aren't fully explained, but it works well. It gives you a few details and it's up to you to stay onboard. I'm not sure if they could have stretched it to two films, but I wish that they had.Acting: Hera Hilmar is great as Hester. Robert Sheehan channels a little bit of a non-mentally-disabled Eddie Redmayne/Newt Scamander. There's a mild romance between the leads, which isn't developed due to the pace of the film, but they have good chemistry. Hugo Weaving is great as usual. The pace of the film means that character development is a bit thin, but the actors had enough to work with.Overall: Great. Pleasantly surprised. Nice to see an ambitious film that isn't afraid to swing for the fences.",Mortal Engines

I had a good time. Yes, some of the complaints of this movie is somewhat accurate. Like, not so much fleshed out characters or any spectacular, complex and imaginative writing, when it came to the plot. And not the worlds best and amazing acting in any regards, but still, it was not bad either, very much alright and acceptable, I've seen far worse acting.Now, I have no idea how this movie coresponds with the books, since I know nothing of them. But the universe is aboslute nonsense when it comes to realism, so you have to throw that type of critical thinking a side. Then, it's a really cool concept of a world that you didn't get to see that much of in the film actually, I would like to have known more about it. At the same time, this movie did not overstay its own welcome, by dragging on. It's an adventure-action flick, within a strange sci-fi setting, a concept of a world that definitely is the most original part of the movie, and a world I personally really liked. And the cigi and sound is absolutely great in the movie also!The movie had some points when I got worried that it was turning really bad. But it pickde up again not long after and saved it self. It has (in my opinion) some cool characters for example, even though they come across a bit shallow since we don't really get to know them that much. Still, it works fine like this for me, like I already stated, I was entertained and didn't judge the movie to harshly, just tried to enjoy myself and I did.This movie is perhaps a bit predictable but still a good time. I don't feel at all it deserves to be knocked down so much, as it has been. The action scenes are really good and pleasent for the eyes also. And story, characters and acting is not bad at all, actually a fair bit over what I personally would call bad. 7.2/10 overall for me.",Mortal Engines

186,boe_dye,"It's like a PG Steampunk Matrix, in Howl's Moving Castle w/ a Terminator Cameo",4,16 December 2019,"I'll give this movie credit, it is original. Steampunk moving cities that somehow managed to be built 1000 years or so after a worldwide 60 minute war is kind of interesting.After that, everything devolves into nonsensical one liners, and tropes with a finale of a love interest that is not only forced, it really comes out of nowhere. The concept of the film is compelling, but the real problem lies in having too much happening for no apparent reason. There is no seeming motivation for the villain to be the villain other than it gives Hugo Weaving something to do.People pop in, things happen, and after a while it becomes a matter of ""spot the movie that did this already"", so much in fact that the Chinese ""not Trinity"" lady, actually does a scorpion kick in a fight scene. After a while it became more entertaining to spot the ""not this"" and ""not that"" rather than actually watching the movie and plot unfold.It's not an awful watch, but it get's a bit cringey at times especially with the ""not Terminator"" undead robot guy. That character was one I found myself wanting to know more about, and all we were really left with is he was going to give the emo scarface girl what she wanted; to no feel or remember anything by making her a robot.Scarface Girl was the most difficult to accept in this movie. I understand that when you are taking descriptions from a book, you kind of have to wing it. However if she was cut from a knife attack, I would think the scarring wouldn't look like she had her face look like ""not Jigsaw"", but maybe have a sizable, but less distracting scare on her face.Things didn't make sense, the world while interesting, just left too much out. Why anyone who make a city on wheels to tear around the world is beyond me. Why they would drive from London to China is again, beyond me, especially since they were so concered with fuel and resources -- that's not a small trip by any account, and for what; to start a war?I feel like the book answered more, but as I am not the type of movie goer who goes to to the movies in order to read the book later, i'll probably just wiki the finer plot points.Like most YA novel's and stories, this appeals to a younger and perhaps less depth seeking demographic. It's great if you like anime styling that leave little to think about, but otherwise it's kind of boring and forgettable.",Mortal Engines
187,margulanabutrlov,Mortal Engines Review,7,22 March 2019,"In a post-apocalyptic future, mobile cities on huge caterpillar tracks roam the landscape, gobbling up smaller towns for their resources. Londoner Tom (Robert Sheehan) is proud of his home until he meets Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) and learns that London's hero Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving) may not be as upstanding as he thought.
As visual metaphors for capitalism go, the sight of a towering, mobile London running down and swallowing a smaller town is pretty compelling. The stripped world of Mortal Engines is dying, and humanity on the verge of extinction caused by its own hubris. And yet hubris still dominates, with each city convinced of its own manifest destiny to become the alpha predator in this world of ""municipal Darwinism"". It makes a compelling hook for this Peter Jackson-produced epic, but it's the setting for a fairly conventional adventure story.
The good news is that long-time Jackson collaborator and first-time director Christian Rivers keeps the action beats coming and the pace up. The story, based on Philip Reeve's book, has been neatly streamlined for the screen, keeping the emotional beats - even adding more for extra heft - but chopping out large swathes of unnecessary back and forth as our heroes struggle to figure out what's going on and eventually to stop a plot that threatens the whole planet. Someone, it seems, is trying to recover the weapons that once cracked the world's crust and set cities on the move.
As young London historian Tom Natsworthy, Sheehan is a likeable lead, though the role is thankless. He's just a naïf caught up in larger events, giving others the chance to explain things to him and the audience. Far more interesting is Hester (Hilmar), the mysterious and masked girl who stabs a man without obvious provocation almost as soon as we meet her. Why she did so becomes a central plank of the film's plot. Hera Hilmar's an engaging presence even when snarling and desperate, and her unusual background and conflicted desires gives her a different feel to the identikit action women of other films.
If Hugo Weaving's Valentine cuts a largely familiar figure, there is a lot of welcome texture in the supporting cast, from Stephen Lang's terrifying Terminator-alike Shrike to Jihae's outrageously cool Anna Fang. And the world-building is as good as you'd expect from a Lord Of The Rings-trained director. From the metres-deep tracks that each city leaves behind to the Mad Max-esque scavengers who try to survive outside the city structures, there's a real sense of desperation and decay everywhere. Even in the towering London we spend more time in the rattling bowels of the city than in its towering heights (St Pauls tops the structure, dome and all still standing as it did through the Blitz).
The plot, however, remains a little predictable, and hits some distinctly Star Wars beats as it trundles towards its end. But there are moments of real grace along the way, and more thrilling adventure than you might expect, so it's a good start for Rivers and an effort worthy of Jackson's record.",Mortal Engines
188,Field78,"Big names on the car, amateurs behind the wheels",4,13 December 2018,"December is often the month to look out for one of Peter Jackson's fantasy spectacles since he and his writing partners Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh revived the genre 17 years ago with The Fellowship of the Ring. He has since treated us to two superior sequels, a pretty solid King Kong remake, and an underestimated Hobbit trilogy. A year ago we already saw teaser trailers for Mortal Engines, which did what teasers should do: they make us hungry. And of course, it had Jackson's name proudly displayed all over it. But don't let that fool you, because he didn't direct this one.That is no problem in itself, because Jackson on the producer's seat gave us the masterful District 9 (another underrated gem worth watching) and The Adventures of Tintin (technically a Spielberg movie, but still). However, in this case, his script contribution and Christian Rivers on the director's chair are by far the biggest problems of the movie.A world where huge cities are turned into moving vehicles sounds like something that could be very cinematic, and indeed, it looks great on screen. Especially the parts where a huge predator city swallows and recycles a smaller one is exactly the kind of imagery that the makers must have envisioned. There are more beautiful locations in the film, like a city in the air, some good ideas and action scenes, and the film sells these things well enough for me not to question the logic of it. But this is as far as good worldbuilding goes, because the (back)story and characters are used in a most uninspired fashion.A good director knows how to balance exposition with advancing the narrative, but Rivers clearly lacks such talent. The first 15 minutes are a barrage of expository conversations with clearly no other purpose than bringing the audience up to speed. Afterwards, the characters remain nothing more than one-dimensional archetypes throughout the movie (the silent heroin, the young hero with an unfulfilled talent, the hammy villain with world-domination ideas, the brown-nosing creep), and some even disappear from the film without any narrative consequence, which says something about the quality of the script (more about that later).A cast full of fresh faces is usually a good thing compared to miscast band of A-listers, but most of the bit players get too little screentime or act too badly to make a good impression. A band of racially diverse heroes is introduced very late in the story, which is a mistake because the movie doesn't emotionally invest in them, so we couldn't care less about their fate. Not that the actor's direction is of any help, by the way. Hera Hilmar is downright boring and unbelievable as the tough protagonist, and Hugo Weaving does a uninspired bad guy act that fails to generate any sympathy. Robert Sheehan as Tom seems to be the only one having some fun with his role.There is not much joy to get from the storytelling part either, as the by-the-numbers plot clearly took a backseat to the visuals here. Most dystopian sci-fi movies make grateful use of their universe's mythology, and the beginning is promising. But the backstory is quickly used as an excuse to have the villains search for a very powerful item, with the heroes drawn in to stop them through way too many badly written coincidences. If this sounds like a cheap version of The One Ring, you're not wrong.To spice up the heroine's motivations, they invented a dead-end subplot featuring some sort of green Terminator, but like lots of other things in this movie, this is just a nice idea, badly developed, and thrown in without proper motivation or catharsis. The film takes itself much too seriously with hardly any moderating humor, and the cheesiness towards the end becomes so bad that the 'shocking revelation' (a clear rip-off from another fantasy series) amounts to absolutely nothing.How a big studio allowed this film to be helmed by a storyboard artist with only two short film segments under his belt is anyone's guess. I assume Rivers was accomplished enough as an artist to sway them with his intended look for the film (which is absolutely the most positive part of the film). Jackson probably vouched for him, and got poor Hugo Weaving involved to secure the budget. Jackson shouldn't be blamed completely for giving promising talent a chance, but he, Boyens and Walsh should seriously contemplate their contributions to the screenplay. Three Oscar-winning writers who managed to get the unfilmable Lord of the Rings novels to the screen should be able to do substantially better than this.I know we have been spoiled by series like Game Of Thrones where there is ample time to set up story, subplots and characters, something that is always challenging in a 2-hr movie. But when you want to start a new fantasy franchise, at least put a certified cook in the kitchen who knows how to balance the ingredients, and prevent it from becoming the next Golden Compass.",Mortal Engines

This movie is pure CGI-galore and they don't even try to hide it.
There's nothing wrong with some CGI if it's done right; it's meant to be used sparingly. This movie consists almost entirely of CGI scenes.This is one of the few movies that I had to walk out on. I just couldn't finish it and God knows I tried. It was quite literally an insult to my senses and intelligence.
Storytelling-wise the characters weren't properly introduced and there was just too much fluff overall.I guess one could classify this as a steampunk movie. But it's not a good one at that. They referenced highly advanced technology like the so called ""quantum energy weapons"" and yet they live in pretty derelict mechanical monstrosities that look like they're in dire need of an upgrade. I can only suspend my disbelief so much. Do you know how much energy is necessary for the continuous locomotion of a big city? A lot. The whole design of these ""mortal engines"" doesn't make any sense. It would've made more sense to create ships of similar magnitude instead of building gigantic monster trucks, because that's what these ""mortal engines"" actually are. Let's not forget the fact that our planet is mostly covered in water. That, combined with the fact that buoyancy assisted locomotion in an aquatic medium is more energy efficient than the locomotion on land.... and you'll understand why I loathe the movie so much.The only way you can enjoy this movie is if you turn off your brain.

Also, the story tries to make a big reveal of the fact that the villain is the girl's father, but it was pretty much understood since the moment she talked about her past. The cyborg's arch was strange for me, since I never understood why he would want to kill the girl just because she didn't want to become a cyborg, but that might just be me.

I enjoyed every minute of it, although the key character moments fell flat. I'd definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the mood for a sci-fi action adventure, or if you just really love the steam punk aesthetic (it's not a great movie, but its leagues above dreck like Wild Wild West).The movie started out with a harrowing action sequence that both entertained and served as an introduction to the world. That's where director Christian Rivers and Producer Peter Jackson went wrong. This is the plot summary sold through print marketing and in the commercials, trailers:In a post-apocalyptic world where cities ride on wheels and consume each other to survive, two people meet in London and try to stop a conspiracy.That's not wrong-but it's not what the movie's really about. Mortal Engines, like all movies, is about character. And a young woman named Hester Shaw (an underserved Hera Hilmar) whose adventure, like Luke Skywalker's, brought her into contact with a number of fearsome foes and flighty friends was the main protagonist here. But again, her character arc was mishandled because the filmmakers opted to put action and spectacle first, leaving much of her character development to come later in the movie by way of flashbacks and such... tsk, tsk (wagging finger). That's not how you develop a character, and that's especially not how you set up emotional payoffs (and there were several missed opportunities).Mortal Engines, which cribbed from episodes 4 and 5 of the Star-Wars saga, missed or ignored the most important aspect of the OT's success: putting character first.

But it came to mind during this colourful, post-apocalyptic fantasy. Peter Jackson and his band of usual suspects are masters at the craft. The sense of scale is vast and presented beautifully and cleverly with proper use of what I would call virtual lenses. These reflect how the massive objects, main characters in the film, really, would appear in real life. Whether it be through the eyes of a character or through a wide lens, long lens, or whatever the scene required. Recreating the visual aberrations or characteristics of each lens adds so much to the reality of a shot. For most viewers it is a subconscious recognition of what is real based on the myriad of real photographed images when have seen since early childhood. A technical point but valid here. I'll press on.
The scale of the storytelling reminded me of the David Lynch Dune which was something I had trouble grasping as a youngster while the visuals were certainly memorable.
The characters in this film were great. Each a fresh take on characters we've seen in other film genres like psychological dramas and political thrillers but placed in this enthralling, dark fantasy-scape.
There's more to be said because there's quite a bit in the film - plenty of side-stories and colourful characters.
Did I mention the action? World-building is quite a talent but world-building while stuff is simultaneously getting blown-up, gracefully flown around, or shot at, punched, kicked, and stabbed, that takes genius. It's spilling over in this muted love story, coming-of-age quest, sci-fi extravaganza, family drama, war epic.

I do think its kind of crazy that they pick a stunningly beautiful woman, put a slight scar on her face and try to convince us as the audience that this makes her ugly.

Yeah, it looks good (but this stuff was done 15 years ago). The screenplay is like a template.I felt nothing for any single character.There is plenty of nonsense here both from the actions of characters and the seriously generic dialogue.

They've built an entire incredibly unique world for this movie. Everything on screen is gigantic and breathtakingly grand in scale. It looked like a live action Final Fantasy game.I loved that it was a story where we didn't really know where the main characters were headed and so it's unpredictable where the story's going to end up. And I appreciate that this is a story that takes itself seriously, unlike certain other big movies these days that keep trying way too hard to be funny, by constantly sticking in forced comedy.And the music is beautiful, continuing Tom Holkenborg's streak as one of the best film composers today. Everything he's done that I've heard has been great.And the lead actress has a very unique sounding, soothing voice. I liked hearing her speak.If I had to complain about anything, it's that the couple of hand-to-hand combat/sword fighting sequences were hurt by some overly choppy editing. Hollywood action directors, please learn to hold your shots during fight scenes. Quit cutting every split second. But anyway, those couple of fights weren't the focus here though, to be fair. This movie was all about the vehicular action, tanks, planes, and such, which all looked spectacular. I'd say this looked better than anything the last couple of Star Wars movies have been doing.And ignore the rotten critics. Ignore the wannabe critics as well, the ones who've been whining and complaining about seemingly every movie for the past couple of years except Disney/Marvel, just because that's the trend these days.",Mortal Engines

They were, imo, all ACTING. I didn't care about the characters at all and I LOVE action & fantasy movies and see every one of them generally. While not being horrible, it was kind of boring. Oh!

235,achmoye,A script that went through a mortal engine.,2,3 February 2019,"Alright. So we got cities chasing each other, with decent CGI, in a steampunk universe. Pretty amazing, right ?
Do you imagine the possibilities, the social analysis, the metaphor of such an original plot ?Well forget them, because you won't find them here.
The first 15-20 are ok until we figure out these cities are not here to support a story, they are here to impress you in the trailer with CGI and then make you pay your entry.
This is the same, pathetic, old, Hollywood mechanic. And we still fall for it.The ""chasing cities"" universe is not used at all except CGI showoff. There is still some ideas in staging, like when they run on the big wheels, but that's all.There is no explication whatsoever of why would it be worth it to live in moving cities (consumes fuel like Cap Canaveral but yeah, I guess they are some reasons)
Did I mention the two lions that must be 20.000 pounds each, on the main city, just for the fancy look ? Do you think it's worth it, as it must double the fuel consumption ?
And all the building are made of stone like they are not weighing anything at all. Did you even TRY to think about your universe ?
Copying the steampunk, scavenger look from everywhere in fiction won't make you an artist if you have no idea what to do with it.
This is just a collection of patterns, cinema tropes, with no storytelling skills.Oh, and the main city ""London"" engine is fed by....metal ? Really ? Do you even physics ? You know it's endothermic, right ? Metal REQUIRES energy to be melted, so you're actually cooling down your furnace into a big pile of metal. Yeah.
Talk about Steampunk coherency. Jules Vernes, Edgar Allan Poe...please save us.There is no character development, and you can't make a story without good characters.
From the director's interview ""I did not wanted to rely on CGI, but rather rely on characters and story to make a good movie"". Well I guess you the theory at least.I couldn't care less about these characters, they are boring with no persona, they always have this ""slightly worried"" face, which is the exact face you make when you have no idea what you character is supposed to feel when you're acting.It's hilarious how they keep adding characters throughout the story, and the way that it doesn't fix anything.
I have to say the Korean one is pretty interesting and colourful. That's about it. Still no idea what it does here though.Oh, and the Zombie-like who adopted MC, what about it ?
I guess it wasn't enough to make a movie about chasing cities, uh ? In fact, by adding these characters, they actually admit that they have NO IDEA how to use the concept of cities chasing each other.
Again, what about the background ? What about the relationships between cities ?I love a quote from the engineer : ""I need these low-techs to stabilize isotopes"" basically saying ""See ? I'm a scientist because I use strange words and you don't understand ?""
But I wanna understand. Isotopes ? Tell me about it. Why are you dealing with isotopes when you can't even figure out how to fuel your furnace ? And you're gonna stabilize these isotopes with an old low-tech dusty piece of metal ? That's amazing ! Show me.Obviously I don't recommend.

Like 'I want to kill you because you did not like my Idea'...huh ?Villain looked like no-villain. I expect a 'menacing character' that will strike some fear from the face...but no.maybe a scar, a swarthy face, flesh missing from cheek...there are infinite combinations to the definition of 'menacing', but what we get is a smart immaculate, hair nicely combed villain. bah..boring
Knife falls down , there is a 1 in a million chance that it would be grabbed, yes it gets grabbed and with it's handle.Villain kicks Tom into a shredder-gutter (or whatever it was). Tom & hester both come out absolutely unscathed. oh..yes..Tom had a bump in his head..that's all.A seasoned ruthless villain who kills all who come in his path...did not know that going through the shredder just causes a head bump.These are the reasons the film 'bumped'.",Mortal Engines

A brief glimpse of a battle between a couple of them would've been nice. There's nothing of surprise in the story, other than shockingly nonsense at some things. A 4-legged walking prison colony in the middle of the sea? As expected, 1 leg goes down and it all goes under.

Sadly writing wise its just as much of a mess..Hugo is the only real ""Name"" from the main cast and as usual his performance is very good. His acting skill is superb and he did in V a performance that would cripple most actors.. with a mask seriously hampering hhis ability to convey meaning, feelings and emotion to the audience he pulled it off in spectacular fashion IMO. But that said even the acting skill he displayed in V and many other roles could not alone save this pathetic mess of a movie.Jackson has brought us some absolutely brilliant films with the LOTR trillogy.. and even the Hobbit was above average (despite idiootic $ grubbbing execs forcing it to be 3 films. They should have followed JRRs originnal plan there).. but he has also failed at times as well and this movie is definately one such example.Watch it if you have 2 hours a BIG screen to appreciate the visuals.. but dont waste $ buying it and dont nab it just because of credits for Jackson or Hugo being there..Its simply too much of a mess.. and ultimately falls flat on its face regardless of actors, producers..I give it a 4 only due to the visuals and Hugos performance.. and thats barely a 4.

The world is interesting, taking place atleast thousands of years from today in a steampunk world of traction cities, Municipal Darwinism, and Resurrected Men. There was so much to like. The lore, the world, the main characters, the tragic backstory, the fact that Asian Morpheus makes that outfit look good, and the non-typical balance of romance, bromance, and friendship... all between two people. Speaking of romance, the writer managed to surprise me by defying expectations with how those scenes played out.There's something strangely appreciate-able about the fact that the main character wasn't ""hot"" or even sexualized. Asian Morpheus did wear that shirt, though, so I guess they found a way to sneak it in there. Not that I'm complaining. Hell, other than that, I don't recall anything that could be considered a sexualization in this.If there's any reason why you should see this in theatres, it's for dem visuals, especially when the traction cities and Shrike are on screen. Dat devastation near the end, tho. It hurt deeply. In an instant, I became anti-war and pro-denuclearization. That being said, it was beautifully done.About the ending. It made complete sense for them to make that decision, especially considering what their leader says a few scenes prior. However, there is something bizarre about seeing those mofos being treated that way immediately after everything that happened.

261,iamjacksmoviechannel,A Patchwork of Other Movies,4,11 December 2018,"So Mortal Engines shows just how great it is that we live in a world where an adaptation of a YA novel comes every couple months.Mortal Engines is...a film. Many films actually. Something of a patchwork of films- Mad Max, Star Wars, Waterworld, Howl's Moving Castle. That's just the surface.Here cities have had to load themselves up on tank tracks and roam around an apocalyptic wasteland looking for fuel and food.These gigantic monstrosities adorned with buildings, gardens, roads, and exhaust pipes never feel lived in so much as they're just eyesores.Hugo Weaving is some big higher-up of the city of London, which is just crushing it in the whole devouring other cities thing, and he's just getting started.Hera Hilmar plays Hester, a mopey survivalist seeking revenge on Weaving for killing her mom and scarring up her face, though not as badly as in the book cause you know, you gotta sell the teen lover angle.Robert Sheehan is Tom, the other teen, he looks like a complete puss next to Hester and requires saving constantly.These two encounter quirky, murderous, and freedom-fighting characters, none of which funny or memorable, as they make their way back to the final showdown with Weaving.Of course they fall in love along the way but the movie is so fast-paced and scattered you'd hardly ever recognize they even have chemistry.More problematic than how derivative and frankly joyless this all is is that the only real emotional beats take place in flashbacks I would have rather seen fleshed out than watch the actual movie.The best that could be said for this is that Peter Jackson actually didn't direct it, as the marketing seems to be misleading people to think.That dishonor goes to Christian Rivers, Jackson's storyboard artist, although it's hard to tell what drew either to this.

The premise is tried and true; but it is executed to perfection.It's a long movie; but they have a lot to cram in and it fits like a glove. You have to see this movie in a theater. It is worth your money.,Mortal Engines
269,watcher101,Don't believe the bad reviews,7,20 April 2019,"This movie has been getting a lot of negative reviews, but don't believe them. I can tell you right now that most of them are just complaining about how different the movie is from the book, from plot elements, to how the main character's facial scars aren't accurate. Truthfully, I haven't read the book, so I can't say how different one is from the other, but the previews made it look good, so I went to see it.To be perfectly honest, based on the expectations I set for the movie from the previews, going in knowing next to nothing about it, I admit I set my expectations a little too high. That being said, I still very much enjoyed the movie. Yes, there were a few cliches and predictability here and there, but when isn't that the case these days? The movie was great for what it was, a fun adventure film that entertains you, and had great special effects. When it came down to it, did I enjoy the movie? Yes, very much. It was kind of a cross between Mad Max: Fury Road, The Hunger Games, and Divergent. It made me interested in wanting to read the books. If you enjoy the young adult fantasy/adventure genre, you'll like this one.",Mortal Engines
270,KissMyAss31193,Mad Max Fury Road 2...,3,7 February 2019,"...that's the first thing that popped into my head when I watched the trailer for this overblown tragedy. Funny enough, I thought the same thing during the first 10 minutes of screening it. The voice over narration, the starting shots of our protagonist veiled in mystery, the chase action sequence leading to the reveal of the title. It's like they just hit copy and paste but added some unnecessary filler just to give screen time to ultimately pointless action. It takes this movie 3 times as long to deliver so much less then Fury Road that it can only be described as pathetic. Especially considering that they were definitely going for that, hence the soundtrack by Junkie XL. Bwraaaam! But first!
I can and will not make judgements on the plot based around the content of the book because I haven't read it and it doesn't matter.
Whether or not the movie works because or even though it takes from the book makes no difference. Because the movie doesn't work. It blows! And it reeks of uninspired pandering. And the script is horrendous! Some of the lines seem to have been overlooked from the first draft. There are so many stupid things in this movie and the dumbest is of course our main protagonist. She is so boring. You can't just make a character look cool and hope that people will just latch onto that and root for an aimless stupid character with no characterization. She is the best developed character in this entire film and she can be summed up in one word. ""there.""
She is just there. Like everyone else is just there. Protagonist there; Action there; Villain there; Characterization there; Subversion there.
And while all of these elements can make for a great theater going experience, in this giant hunk of junk which can barely connect the threads it just comes of as recycled.",Mortal Engines

But the lack of an engaging plot would be par for the course as most movies in the young adult category tend to be like that except that we are also asked to accept a very disturbing sense of morality that pervades the whole picture. Apparently, the people who cheer and delight in the destruction of other cities are innocent of wrong doing and should be accepted into the bosom of the people they had only recently tried to destroy.The visuals were not stunning and the sets were singularly unimaginative.

The story is age old though set in a rolling wheeled mess of leftover past civilization and the quirks are great...lotsa the tech gear stuff some do so well. This ISN'T a transformer look...its BETTER .
The plot may seem muddled but its not; just full of cool characters that have enough info to make you care what happens to them, ok maybe alot of weird nasty ones too.i LOVED this. The visuals and FX are so grand and it shows that when Peter Jackson & his team are involved the limit is ONLY their amazing imagination, this can be seen by all and the message is classic warnings of humans desire for power of others. No what we did to the world we call home. All great actors to boot. Heroes abound! Villians do great harm. You think you're safe then more VILLAINY!!

288,cinemawithcj,Mortal Engines - Cinema with CJ Review,6,11 December 2018,"Mortal Engines is Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens writing an adaptation of the first of a book series turned into a massive sprawling special effects frenzy. Unlike Lord of the Rings, however, the thing this movie lacks is story and character.
Jackson is not at the helm here, instead duties are given to Christian Rivers, longtime collaborator of Jackson's, and as it turns out, a solid director. Watching Mortal Engines shows exactly why he'd be great at a Dam Busters remake. Here, however, there are problems.
The thing is, Rivers is a super competent and visual director. It makes sense, given his previous storyboarding and visual effect experience. Where the issues really lie are in the story and the characters, which is definitely a biggie.
Mortal Engines creates a wonderfully batshit insane and goofy world you actually buy right into. There is a lot of care and attention and just sheer visual storytelling that makes you settle into a world where London is a city on wheels rolling around the Earth that remains after apocalyptic war. The film is immensely visual and imaginative as to how this world would work and how the people live.
It pains me watching this movie and for all its silliness and art direction and costume design and set design and special effects and basically every technical and visual basis where this film works...where it all falls down with the screenplay.
I do not fault it too much on the screenwriters, who are competent. We know this all too well. It's not just the Academy Awards that sing the praises of their work, but the sheer love and appreciation. Hell, apparently the books this film is based on are also great. It all feels like the story is just lost in translation. Too familiar to too bland storylines that have graced our screens in recent years. Where dystopia and young adult prevail and with it even more mediocrity. Where the average looking and average personalities work well for lowest common denominator teen audiences to project onto but lacking any real substance.
It just never felt great with Mortal Engines. It manages to legitimise it's bonkers premise, but the reason it loses and bores you is because you don't feel anything for this ambitious world. None of the characters' motivations feel worthy of your time. There's generic revenge plots and generic evil schemes, but nothing resonant enough or argued enough to make it anything important. Our two main heroes and the villain are fleshed out just a bit, but every supporting character is just filler. Whether it's the Trinity knock-off or her motley crew of less than one dimensional expendables or the investigating allies at home and their pointless side-stories, Mortal Engines has a severe character problem. Once again, it's strange, because these writers have managed to write films where every single character is important and interesting in their own way. Everyone can be anyone's favourite character.
It's tough being held up to Lord of the Rings, but with this amount of talent behind the film, it's so surprising and shocking just how much Mortal Engines doesn't work. It's confounding how these writers haven't been able to strike again, forgetting every lesson in storytelling in the adaptation of this book.
Mortal Engines is full of potential, but half of it is squandered. We may never see a sequel, which is a legitimate shame. This world is brilliant, but clearly the world is not.
Then again, when you read the synopses of the next few books, you kinda have to feel thankful that this is where these moving cities are cinematically gonna grind to a halt.",Mortal Engines
289,jetskiboybze,Thoroughly Enjoyable Romp through Steampunk,8,15 July 2019,"Well I have two things to say straight off. Firstly is there something wrong with me? I really enjoyed this film yet apparently hardly anyone else did judging by the rating, which is pretty hard to understand given some of the highly rated high profile tosh that is out there. This is certainly on a par if not better than most of that. Secondly it was not at all what I expected from the trailers. I expected more mobile city fighting and more Mad Maxy type mayhem. That being said it was thoroughly enjoyable as a spectacle and it certainly was a spectacle. Plot was obvious but didnt detract from watchability and was actually nice to not have to figure out tons of specious plot twists
Cast was good although some characters were totally unessecary and superflous to the film and some big salaries certainly could have been saved on the overall budget. Effects were visually believable in the films context and overall a visually excellent spectacle (especially liked the detail of the City ""tyre"" tracks). Loved the juxtaposition of old and new tech and I'm sure hardened Steampunkers must have loved it too. I hope the lack of profit doesnt dissuade the industry not to continue with this genre as I for one thoroughly enjoyed it. Still cant believe it didnt make money with Gandalf himself involved.",Mortal Engines
290,natsuka_arei,Horrible,1,16 December 2018,"A post-apocalyptic world with steampunk theme, looks promising at first yet minutes after you watch it you will find it boring. Very mainstream ideas without uniqueness. To sum it up: It was a story about villain guy trying to take over the world with dangerous power. The betrayal then led the MC to take revenge over the death of loved ones and save the world by defeating the bad guy.I struggle to keep myself looking on it and remind myself not to look at my phone (bet the guys on my right side thought the same haha they constantly gave hilarious comment on how silly the movie was. I also noticed several people in the cinema took out their phone, totally ignore the screen, probably as bored as I was) It was totally wasting my time, except maybe I have materials to write a review about it. Haha.A lot of plot holes in it especially if you don't read the book. So many unfamiliar terms in it. They didn't explain the background of the world they live in. Every character in this movie don't have a decent amount of character development. Pretty shallow and forgettable. It seemed they just throw out the characters without any necessary things to do (only 3 character I see really have lines coherent with the whole story: Hester, Tom, Thaddeus, probably Fang. The other appearances weren't significant to the story imho). Their relation with each other feels forced, bet you will find yourself hardly moved or connected with the characters.There's no chemistry, the love story at both MC felt enforced. The battle scenes were ridiculous. Even the CGI itself looks cheap. The only one thing able to spark my interest a little bit (and the only reason I gave 1 star) was the past of Hester with Shriek. Even though that part was interesting (with...flaws of course), I could say it didn't save the whole movie. Another thing, I find myself several time pissed off by how stupid the characters were.For ex, there are several moments the character did unnecessary thing which would be illogical to do considering the situations they were in. Maybe it purpose was to give a bit of drama tone, or...just for joke (but it wasn't funny if it was supposed to be a joke)Totally against you to watch it. Go watch Aquaman, it will save your day.",Mortal Engines
291,cupid_shot_you,Too many one-liners,5,4 June 2021,The entire movie is about the one-liners. Unfortunately that's not enough to carry the whole movie through. The entire concept of the film doesn't make much sense either.,Mortal Engines

Probably one of the main reasons I enjoyed watching it very much. I love a beautiful film with great HDR and I cannot lie!!!I have a minor complaint with the two main female leads. I truly think the movie would be way better if the main female lead was played by a more badass and vulnerable woman. Same with the Chinese female lead. They both don't have the look or charisma which drags down the movie a bit for me. Great actors who have charisma are so vital for a movie.

297,savethecloudsfoundation,Better than I expected,7,18 July 2019,I normally don't like these non stop action fantasy movies but this was very different from anything I have ever seen before. The only part I didn't like was the overly exaggerated mannerisms by all the actors. This is a problem that I have with all movies in this genre. No one acts that way in real life and it is super cringy to me. Think marvel style acting but fewer cheesy one liners.

Taken in it's place, which is the evolving Steampunk era as it was evolving at the beginning of the 21st Century, this is an engaging, well paced, tale of greed for power and it's destructive force, not unlike our 45th President.
Have love stories evolved much from Romeo and Juliet? Not really. Is anything truly original, not a lot. So taken on its merits is the story enjoyable and the characters engaging? I think very much so. Is this Ingmar Bergman as his prime, no, but that's not what I'm expecting.
Is it film made for an age of heroines rather than heroes, very much so. That may be what pisses off the fan boys who are more interested in macho posturing.

301,luke-eberhardt,A Wild Dystopian Fantasy Epic of a Thrill Ride,8,13 December 2018,"I read Philip Reeve's novel; 'Mortal Engines' a year ago, mainly when I heard the news about Peter Jackson; the man behind the 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Hobbit' film franchises announced he and his team would produce a big budget film adaptation of the book. While the directorial reigns for the film were given to his long time colleague; Christian Rivers, who did most of the storyboard art for Jackson's films since 1992's 'Braindead' (or 'Dead Alive'), Rivers also has an Oscar to his name for 'Best Achievement in Visual Effects' for 2005's 'King Kong', some short film credits and worked as an Assistant Director on Jackson's 'Hobbit' films.'Mortal Engines' is the first of a four book series which can described as being a post-apocalyptic steampunk fantasy, largely aimed at Young Adult audiences.
Personally speaking, what I loved about the book wasn't just the unique world it's set in, but also how within all the madness of this obscure society involving Traction Cities, Airships and a whole load of weird contraptions; could involve some great plotting and compelling characters in an action packed thrill ride of an adventure that also displayed a unique sense of authenticity and cultural backdrops that felt fresh for any sort of dystopian sci-fi or fantasy novel.The opening sequence involves London one of biggest Predator Cities hunting upon the desolate former European continent chases down a smaller city for it's consumption. While, it's been common since the original 'Star Wars' film was released, grabbing the audience's attention for such a spectacle is an easy method of engagement, especially with big transports hunting smaller ones.
The main characters include; Hester Shaw (Hera Himler) a mysterious girl with a scarf covering her face, whose intentions are just mysterious as she appears. Also, there's Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan), a city boy who works as a historian's apprentice in the London Museum, keeping old relics and artefacts in shape from a civilization long gone. Then there's Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving) the Head Archaeologist of London, whose high statue and demeanour commands great respect among the hierarchy of London's Elizabethan class system aboard the traction city.Once the smaller town has been consumed by London, Tom goes down to salvage any relics or artefacts the consumed cities have been carrying, proving that one's trash might be another person's treasure. Meanwhile, the mysterious Hester goes in towards Valentine to exact her vengeance, while Tom stops her from committing the assassination not sure what's this is all about. After chasing her through the bellies and digestive clutter of mechanics of London's engines feeding off the consumed city, Tom then becomes aware of Hester's vengeance when her scarred face is revealed behind her scarf, before she jumps out of London's waste tunnel. While Valentine's wounds aren't fatal, he's glad to see the young man in good shape, yet in this small moment his ugly side is revealed proving Hester's words were right and in an effort to silence any other rumours about his more supposed secretive and devious intentions or any other ugly history, Valentine pushes Tom over the edge of the waste tunnel and out into the wasteland.It's here, the city boy whose enjoyed the company of respectable civilization on a traction city, becomes a 'fish out of the water' being exposed to the madness of the wastelands/hunting grounds. But, more importantly must put his trust in Hester; a young woman he has no reason to, even if they both must stick together to survive the dangers of the wasteland or the world for that matter, together. Their adventure then unfolds as they traverse across the wastelands and in the air upon airships encountering many different quirky, dangerous and imposing characters.A few other characters worth mentioning are Anna Fang (Jihae) an imposing aviator whose prowess and badass demeanour could give characters like Imperator Furiosa and Han Solo a run for their money. She quickly becomes Tom and Hester's ally abroad her brightly red airship; the 'Jenny Haniver', she's also the leader of a group called the Anti-Tractionists, who're purely against the use of traction cities. But the most menacing and intimidating of them all is Shrike (Stephen Lang) a Stalker, AKA a resurrected man whose mind is twisted into a menacing killing machine and whose organic organs have been replaced with that of ancient robotics making him and imposing cyborg almost akin to the 'Terminator.' His role is more of a side story that's largely connected to that of Hester's past and there's never a dull moment with Shrike, as Lang makes the character stand out as a piece of the horrific technology who will stop at nothing until he gets what he wants.While Sheehan, Himler and Weaving keep the main plot in focus. It's Jihae and Lang who provide the story's catalysts pushing the plot into more maddening compelling territory full of danger and excitement. Other supporting acting roles serve the story adequately well too, in correspondence to the book's would take me a longer to analyse than what I think is more important. Other than the fact their brief appearances are clearly defined well enough to thank the film-making team to stand out.One of the biggest comparisons I can draw from 'Mortal Engines' especially in how a post-apocalyptic scenario involving high stakes action displayed on such huge spectacle, is obviously going to be 'Mad Max: Fury Road.' It should come to no surprise that when spectacle is more of a forefront to a film, it comes more into focus than the characters involved in the plot. But much like 'Fury Road' the characters are compelling enough to make their motivations clear. However, if it weren't for the gifted performers bringing the characters up front within the film's plot it wouldn't be so much about their 'personal story' than what the world's premise would promise and there's so much life in the world, it's hard not to be invested.Also, much like 'Fury Road' and Jackson's other films for that matter, including the other films he produced such as Neil Blomkamp's 'District 9' and Steven Spielberg's 'The Adventures of Tintin', the breath, dimension and vision they brought towards the world of 'Mortal Engines' stands out so well on the big screen, it's no wonder how much passion was shown for bringing to life such an unique world filled to the brim with authentic set-pieces and thrilling special effects that WETA Workshop are so capable of delivering.I've comes to expect differences from adaptations of many kinds. So it wasn't surprising to me there were many liberties taken when comparing the book and film differences. I'm glad to say the film stood out incredibly well as being the same story Philip Reeve wrote in his book all those years ago and stands out incredibly well on screen thanks to the devotion and dedication the filmmakers have made to such a project. One not being too much like the other but stands out enough that if you've read the book or if you haven't, it's safe to recommend.However, while this may easily be one of favourite films of 2018. It's not without its flaws, some of the exposition on certain objects and concepts in the film serves too much of a crash course to viewers as if we're going to expect some of that to play into the plot later, it unsurprisingly does. The third act climax also places a lot of certain McGuffins easily placed throughout the film find their place used adequately. There's even a number of flashback sequences focusing on Hester's past, although they're serviceable enough, they could have been lessened, which would have given the films mysteries more thought than experiments the viewers would pick up on later. Even with all its flaws, I accept the film for what it is. If audiences are going to find unusual parallels to other franchises? you can't deny the fact the film is hugely 'unique' and should be a focus for a new film franchise.Overall, Think 'Mad Max: Fury Road' mixed with some of the best aspects of franchises such as 'Harry Potter', 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Star Wars' and that's 'Mortal Engines' in a nutshell. While Peter Jackson's other cinematic efforts may raise expectations, I highly implore viewers to make up their own minds, perhaps it'll get them to read the books. It's the story of a young man who despite coming from the comforts of city life, discovers his bravery and purpose in a world full of madness and chaos with having to trust a woman who despite the resentments of her past upbringing has to overcome her motivations by connecting to others who give her life more meaning. While that's the personal story of 'Mortal Engines' within it's heart, it's the exciting spectacle and unique world with the compelling characters that make the film a significant achievement for Christian Rivers and Peter Jackson. It's an incredibly 'Wild Dystopian Fantasy Epic of a Thrill Ride' that I had a great time watching and can't wait to see it again, along with the potential sequels of three more books to be adapted from the series.",Mortal Engines
302,homdeb1058,Threatens to Become One of My All Time Favorite Movies,9,17 December 2018,"Wow, I almost let the whiners and amateur critics keep me from seeing this movie. What a terrible mistake that would have been. The bad reviews puzzle me, because I was never bored, the action was virtually not stop, just varied in intensity. I thought the chemistry was great between the leads. I liked and cared greatly for the supporting heroes, and properly despised the villains.
The visuals are stunning, the score is beautiful, the CGI is solid, the world building is imaginative. It has stylish and retro-futuristic elements similar to Jupiter Ascending, Mad Max (the new one), Elysium and The Great Wall, but a way better story than any of those, imo. It's a steampunk smorgasbord.
The storyline is fairly simple and straight forward with a few gentle twists and surprises and none of that getting lost in it's own cleverness. A Star Wars ripoff? Maybe one scene near the end was arguably similar. On the positive side I don't think managing to evoke a similar swashbuckling feeling of fun, adventure, heroism, and kinship throughout the movie can be called a ripoff, but just good movie making.

It sure sometimes prioritizes form over content, it's got some cliche dialogue and the secondary characters don't get as much development as they perhaps should do. But it's got a lot going for it. Rivers has got a very keen eye for the visuals, pace is unrelentless and it's got one of the most interesting CGI characters to grace the big screen in a very long time. I'd say that the highlight of this picture is the strange but, at the same time, heartwarming relationship between the character of Hester and Shreik. In short, good visuals, great CGI by Weta and more importantly, it has a start, middle and end. Could always be some room for a future sequel, but given the box office results so far, I don't think that's gonna happen. Worth giving it a try.",Mortal Engines

The potential for this is unbound although I am sure the cost for creating such a world is huge. It really should be an animated series to get the most expansive universe. Beyond the visuals the film doesn't slot easily into any category. It's not a family action/sci-fi/romance like Stardust or Star Wars as the violence is too real on occasion and the character Shrike is too scary for kids. Even the scaring on the main leading lady is too much.
The film is also not an adult action/sci-fi as the action beyond the machines and aircraft is very weak. No character has any special weapons Or fighting skills and the choreography of fighting doesn't exist.
The final point is the romance seems odd and forced, there isn't any romantic chemistry between the two leads and that is shown in the final scene when there is just a hug of friends.

I instantly felt bored, and disliked the characters because they seemed very random, and not very well drawn out. I decided that someone in this steampunk/book-lacking situation would probably rate it a 4 or a 5 (even 1 apparently, though trust me, people that rate this film 1 star do not know what they are talking about). If you love steampunk, but have not read the book, your rating will easily be increased to 7.5/10.
In many cases, reading the book before the movie is just bad, because of how horrible an adaptation the movie is. But in the case, I by all means recommend reading the book first, because among other things, you will like and understand the characters more, and find much more reason to care about them. Only then

The overall story is rather simple but there are moments where it is interesting. A bit more back story would have been a real good idea. What happened to cause these rolling cities? A supposedly advanced civilisation that thinks weapons from long long ago are superior to what they currently have. Really? Also found the scale of things to be way off. Big city eats little city for power but little city gets stymied by a canyon that isn't much bigger than the tracks left by the big city. Guess maybe in fantasy land things don't have to make sense. But for people that are looking for more than chases, fights and explosions the story does matter and details are important.I'm guessing that most of the great reviews are from younger folks that have grown up with movies that are big on special effects and weak on story. For them this is an acceptable movie. For those looking for a good story, you may be disappointed.",Mortal Engines

Predictable story, villains and pace is all over the place. One for the fans. Personally I feel like Peter Jackson and co have lost their way I know he didn't direct it but was heavily involved inthe production of this waste of time. Apparently this was one of his next pet projects but it lay dormant as he moved onto the hobbit ( also very average), don't think he would have done much more with other then stretch it into three 2 hour plus movies :).

321,strassermarlies,A decent movie with spectacular visulas,7,17 February 2019,"I'm always willing to watch some young adult fantasy-sci-fi-dystopian movie. The first 15 minutes of Mortal Engines didn't impress me much, but then the story really started to shine. The whole world was very captivating and the CGI (which didn't look as CGI at all) was spectacular. I must say it's a while since I have seen such a well done movie with such great visuals. I immediately thought there must be some talented people behind it. It turned out Peter Jackson (responsible for Lord of Rings/The Hobbit) was working on this. That explains a lot! So back to the movie: the story was nothing we have never seen before, but I honestly preferred the main actress over Jennifer Lawrence in Hunger Games. It's hard to understand why movies like Hunger Games and Maze Runner (I love Dylan O'Brian but the movies were stupid) are so successful and well received and this one wasn't. One explanation may be the bad advertising. I got the feeling the movie wasn't hyped at all. Or just the bad timing: people are fed up with such stories. I really don't know why it was such a flop on the Box Office. Was ist worse than Mad Max, Hunger Games etc.? No. Was ist better? No. This was an okay movie which deserves at least 6 stars but I will give it 7 just for the stunning visuals. The characters weren't that charming, but they weren't annoying either. Some of their dialogues were more mature than what we heard in the last superhero installment. It's such a shame that this movie wasn't received very well. And the critics? There must be some political agenda behind it I guess ... Big cities ""eating"" small cities, London on wheels on the run ... whatever.

OK then. Characters thrown on screen that we are expected to care about within 10s or so before their death? OK then. It just seems like Peter Jackson had a sandpit and tried to create everything in it rather than one good thing.I found the musical score to be particularly irritating. This rather average simple tune gets repeated over and over and over again, as if to signal drama or action or something, and it was giving me a headache towards the end of the film such was how frequently it was played.

326,degeneraatti,"A film that tried hard, and failed harder",3,21 January 2021,"Now after 2+ years of it's theatrical release Mortal Engines is known as the biggest financial flop in cinematic history. The effort to make this movie a blockbuster hit and a start for a franchise are evident throughout: the near constant large-scale special effects and great swells of the orchestral score when yet another ""thrilling"" action scene is upon the viewer - and they come like clockwork, as if engineered by a commission. There is also not-too-subtle pandering towards the chinese market.Yet, this movie suffers on many levels. The characters are wafer-thin (""despite"" the heavy use of flashbacks) so it is hard to get invested in their fates. The story tries to focus on the two main characters, yet also drags in too many side characters, with all serving a one-dimensional archetype with backstories explained in dialogue. The storytelling never finds any sort of balance, jumping from heavy underlining exposition to jarringly abrupt scenes that I suppose are meant to keep up the suspense, which is nonexistent due to aforementioned lack of investment and the fact that sweeping shots full of CGI stop having any weight or momentum after we've been saturated with them nearly the whole runtime.I do not enjoy plotholes or pointing out poor screenwriting. Yet I've noticed that if a movie is captivating enough, I do not mind them; while a movie that has no grasp on me seems to shine it's spotlight on its weaknesses. Here it feels like too many set-ups were resolved swiftly enough to be practically discarded, while at the same time many scenes employed a particular deus ex machina where a ""surprise"" came from something that was off-camera for the audience, even though the characters in the movie should've noticed it. And though the movie is of the fantasy genre, it is very hard to maintain the illusion of disbelief when so much of the plot is forwarded through either overblown reactions of the characters or winning-the-lottery levels of happenstance.Despite adequate acting and many technical aspects which were not displeasing, I firmly believe we all have better ways to spend two hours than watching this movie.",Mortal Engines

Based on the novel you can tell that the screenplay took the source material and tried to include too much in 2 hours. It also suffers from the same problem that Valerian had which is actors that portray characters I don't care about at all. The fight sequences (hand to hand) are cliche. The story itself somewhat easy to predict. It did strike me as somewhat original. I know, there are other things like the Dr Who episode where London is on the back of a giant space whale. Cities that eat other cities haven't shown up in western cinema yet (unless I missed something and that can happen). This movie looks so good that had it not come across Aquaman at release I think it would have done better. Certainly it suffers from lazy writing but no one cared because it looks so good. Just know going in to Mortal Engines that you aren't there for the acting or the story but rather state of the art visuals and one kickass bad dude that may or may not be such a bad dude after all.

And while that stands to reason in some respects - after all, we all love to give our own opinions on things - it's not actually useful unless we can connect in some way with the person who's written it.
So before I say any more, I'll tell you that I'm 54 and a single father with an eight-year-old daughter (going on 12), and we watched Mortal Engines together.We both literally wowed during the opening scenes. The scope, the grandeur, the sense of real HUGEness. The attention to detail in CGI throughout this movie is mostly Class A. Building a static model of something is one thing - but to make it behave realistically, with sound, is the trick. The opening scene is reminiscent of Star Wars IV but on Earth..
We were both kept guessing about characters. I loved the early quick, tight script which later opened up.
Sheehan and Hilmar's early-on quickfire lines can't help you but like them from the start.
Hugo Weaving plays one of the most duplicitous characters in any mainstream movie I've ever watched.

I wasn't going to bother reviewing being so many people had already said what I was thinking however I wanted to add my two cents on the whole Shrike thing. The Shrike storyline was, I thought, so out of place in the movie. Perhaps this was an integral part of the book (if it were one) but for the cinema release it was such an out there thing. For all intents and purposes there were humans who somehow put there souls into robotic bodies (similar to the movie 9 which was brilliant by the way). I'm not sure how they did this and he'll i may even be wrong, it was a bit confusing. One thing I will say though, I thought the Shrike death scene was by far the best part of the movie. The flashes of his memories finishing on his child was very emotional and very well done. I also thought the visuals of the weapon in use was great.

346,knight110tim,Visually Stunning Spectacle With Strong Female Leads,9,14 December 2018,"In this age of cookie cutter adventure movies, unnecessary prequels, and never-ending sequels, fans of blockbuster cinema entertainment should be falling over themselves to see the most original piece of cinematic storytelling in years: Mortal Engines.Based on the novel of the same name by Philip Reeve, the tale is set a thousand years in the future, after a catastrophic nuclear conflict has wiped out most of humanity and many the survivors have relocated to mobile enclaves known as traction cities (or 'predator cities').These communities survive and grow by hunting down and capturing smaller towns, stripping them of their resources and absorbing their populations (""Municipal Darwinism"").London is one such apex city, home to our hero Tom Natsworthy (Misfits' Robert Sheehan) who finds himself cast out when he steps in to prevent an assassination attempt on head archaeologist Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving) by the very angry Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar).Hunted by an unstoppable cyborg, Shrike (Stephen Lang), and stranded in the wilderness, the mismatched duo of Hester and Tom eventually fall in with outlaw rebel Anna Fang (South Korean singer Jihae) and together they must find a way to thwart Valentine's insidious scheme to make London the most powerful city on Earth... at the cost of a great many lives.It's no secret that I was predisposed to enjoy Mortal Engines the movie, not only have I raved about and evangelised on behalf of the original book series for longer than I've been writing this blog, but I also consider the author a friend.However, I can honestly say, the film was spectacular.And, yes, this middle-aged man may have shed a few tears of excitement the first time Anna and Hester shared the screen together - these are my two favourite modern literary characters after all, so this was a very special moment for me to see them in live-action.Neither actor portrayed them exactly as I had pictured them in my head, from reading the novels all those years ago, but it turns out that didn't matter: for the duration of the movie they were the powerful and dynamic women I've long been obsessed by.The script, by Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens condenses and streamlines the source material, reducing a nuanced narrative to a non-stop series of action beats.However, the stunning opening chase sequence - of London bearing down on a smaller town as they race across the desolate countryside - is unlike anything we've ever seen before and immediately lets you know this is a unique world we're going to be playing in for the next two hours.Towards its climax the script errs into melodrama, and the action goes a bit Star Wars, but by then we have fallen in love with the characters and are so deeply embedded in the world of Mortal Engines that it carries us along for the ride.As the feature film directorial debut of Christian Rivers, effects wizard and storyboard artist on many of Jackson's previous movies, the film is an in-your-face treat for the senses, full of intricately detailed shots that demand multiple viewings to catch all the minutiae.If for nothing else, Rivers should be applauded for his incredible realisation of Philip Reeve's world, which manages to put an inspired new spin on post-apocalyptic tropes, filtering them through lenses akin to the works of Terry Gilliam or Alejandro Jodorowsky's Dune.Comparing it to previous Peter Jackson epics, I have to confess that I enjoyed Mortal Engines a hell of a lot more than my first viewing of Fellowship Of The Ring, which, for me, only fell into place when I saw the extended director's cut.So I'm holding out hope for an extended iteration of Mortal Engines - when it's finally released to home video - that can only further heighten my enjoyment of this film.",Mortal Engines

The whole point of the so-called Traction Cities is that they are unsustainable and that the philosophy of Municipal Darwinism is flawed. That's the basic conflict: those that recognise this (the Anti-Traction League and the people hiding behind the Shield Wall at Shan Guo) and those that don't (people on the Traction Cities).Thaddeus Valentine, our antagonist brilliantly played by Hugo Weaving (of Elrond and Agent Smith fame), refuses to acknowledge any other way of life. Prey for the city of London is running low, so what are the options? You could stop driving around and start farming or you can build a giant weapon in St Paul's Cathedral to open up brand-new hunting grounds.The parallels in contemporary society and culture are obvious. The refusal, for instance, to recognise that climate change is real and that there's need to wean ourselves off hydrocarbons in favour of renewables being one of them. Here in the UK, projects such as the tidal barrage in Wales get refused permission, while 'new weapons' like fracking technology get approval in Lancashire. It's a lot deeper than it appears on the surface.Jackson makes this implicit rather than explicit, and that's a good decision, because reams of dialogue discussing the flawed philosophy would be dull, but it's there and there's lots to talk about when you think about the implications. Dismissing it as being silly is, I think, unfair, because it's no sillier than any number of other premises in film.It's also a good decision because the script, frankly, isn't spectacular. There's a fair amount of clunky, cringey dialogue (not Attack of the Clones bad, but not great either), not to mention plot threads that get forgotten (what happened to Bevis?). What is spectacular are the visuals. Christian Rivers' background as a VFX artist is obvious. The team at Weta Workshop have gone all-out here. They are flawless. The level of detail is extraordinary, and the opening sequence blew me away. See it on the biggest screen you can find (I saw it on a smallish screen, and I wish I'd gone bigger!). I'm not going to dwell on this too long, but this film is filled to the brim with creativity: costuming, set design, CGI, etc. It's all great.What's not so great, and this will continue to bug me, is Hester's appearance. She is quite possibly unique in young adult fiction in being a capable heroine who doesn't look like a model. She's hideous in the books - brutally disfigured - and so Tom and Hester's slow-burn relationship is all the more touching and real. Tom spends much of the books fixated upon her appearance before gradually seeing beyond the skin. This is a good message to send to teenage boys and girls - see the person.Instead, film Hester is hot. Hilda Hilmar is an attractive actress. As a heterosexual male this isn't ordinarily something I'd complain about, but she's been given a single scar across her face that doesn't really detract from her looks. Tom finding her attractive isn't unsurprising or subversive. Hollywood just can't resist.My other gripe with the film is Junkie XL's score. It's more or less indistinguishable from Mad Max: Fury Road. He's not a subtle composer, and that was fine for a film of non-stop action like Mad Max where bombast is great, but Mortal Engines deserved a bit more subtlety. It needed the John Williams or Howard Shore treatment. There are no themes here - just lots of string ostinatos and brass swells.Overall, Mortal Engines is thoroughly enjoyable. The plot is simple, but so what? Lots of films have simple plots but that doesn't make them unenjoyable. The acting is solid all round. There are few big-name actors here, though a number you'll likely recognise from elsewhere. It's nicely paced, and the action is good (though way too many jump cuts in the fight scenes for my liking - John Wick, Game of Thrones among other things have proven you can have incredible fight sequences without them, without making viewers ill).I want to finish this review by bringing it back to my title. Mortal Engines is a box office flop and has been unfairly panned in my view. It is not a perfect film and the steampunk aesthetic doesn't appeal to everyone (I love it). It's similar to Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets in this respect. Valerian had plenty of flaws - big ones in places - but it was such a refreshing change from the barrage of Marvel. What phase are we on in Marvel now? How many Transformers films have there been (plus spin-offs like Bumblebee)? Fast and Furious?These are all objectively worse films than Mortal Engines, yet somehow these films seem to be immune from box office blunders. I'm not sure what these films have got that Mortal Engines doesn't: they're creative voids and aggressively generic. For those of us who like sci-fi, I think it's important we support films like Mortal Engines. Even more cerebral films like Blade Runner 2049 - a critical success - flopped because no one went to see it (rather like the original Blade Runner).If we want more sci fi action that's not superheroes or Transformers (or dodgy manga adaptations - Alita: Battle Angel doesn't look promising) we need to support other types of cinema, others we'll constantly sink to the lowest common denominator.",Mortal Engines

All these 6 star ratings are ignorant ratings without much research! Thier is much more to learn about this movie and it is not about cities on wheels! That was just a trailer but this is a movie of survival and not repeating the same errors as human beings have done in the past! Humanities defenders against themselves!

356,lf_macias,Enjoyable movie with fine crafted story and characters but feels rushed at the end.,7,11 January 2019,"Produced and adapted by Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens (the team behind the trilogies of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit), Mortal Engines tells a heroic odyssey of several characters who find themselves by hazards of fate in the middle of a futuristic world in which cities are mobile and the largest ones 'eat' the smallest.
It is a film that combines science fiction with adventure and that in general I enjoyed a lot at the entertainment level.
The different stories of the characters of the film are crossed and little by little we learn the past and the current context of the main characters, which allows us as spectators to follow their story.
The performance of the protagonist fulfills in the sense that it goes from being a vengeful to an action heroine and a girl in love; also she is very pretty. Equally Hugo Weaving knows how to interpret villains until in his sleep and here he does it as well as he did previously.
The action scenes are well-armed, they are exciting and constant, so they help maintain a good rhythm in the plot. Also the visual effects are very showy but do not cause discomfort or feel left over.
There is a social commentary on the way in which a first world country receives its migrants with open arms and then deny them opportunities or so that they later become as insensitive as the population that received them. They also address issues of totalitarianism, honor and family ties.
The plot is structured between the sequences of action and go knowing the past of the characters to find their motivations for the conflict; I felt that these narrative resources were well managed.
In particular, the third act contains a form of narration that I enjoy very much: several characters having their own sequences of action, each one fighting with different villains, to achieve the objective that they propose.
However towards the end the film feels rushed, being that it was building well both the plot and the characters. I expected the three main characters to meet for the third act of the film and collaborate to defeat the villains; I think that would have given the climax greater emotion and emotion; but it seems that they left that moment for the sequel that, in the movie form, will never happen because of the box office failure of the film.
This hurry makes the arc of those characters to not close satisfactorily.
But in general, the balance is positive and it is a film that exceeded my expectations and that deserved to be seen by the public in a giant screen because it strives to tell a competent story.",Mortal Engines
357,BeastyBoyFlicks,A Let Down After 10min,4,17 December 2018,"Can't be nice here. So let's start with the positive portion of my review. The production value of this movie is spot on from camera work, CG effects and music/audio. And possibly the overall plot of this movie is good. Unfortunately, this movie is a huge let down that seems to target full and unintelligent pre-teens who need dramatic/unrealistic scenes.So starting with the writing. Disgusted!! For a movie where your world is 100s of years in the future, a ton of things need to be considered. And it seems someone got lazy. And, who has time to style their hair and put on tons of makeup, while being a highly notorious criminal in a apocolyptic world. What really bugged is when one of the main characters was asked if they loved the other person. WHAAAAAT?!? It's only been a short period.

364,mshackletonchavez,Not Directed By Peter Jackson.,6,21 December 2018,"Mad Max on steroids, I was pleasantly surprised by this feature, I think the critics have been much too harsh on this film. It delivers truly breathtaking visuals, with somewhat solid performances and premise, although its screenplay and narrative are messy.This film Apart from I being Peter Jacksons biggest fan, I will attempt to be impartial. Also I have read the book, but that was some time ago. I must say, my major complaint was its underuse of Chudleigh Pomeroy, he was great in the novel, and sorely underused here, also the fact that his name is just amazing and became a joke in my class when we studied the novel. But jokes aside, I have a real reason to root for this film, and surprisingly I was actually happy with the final result. For After I had heard the reviews, I went in with little expectations.Christian Rivers serves as director, however in terms of it's visual splendour, set design, costumes and even style of language, it is very much a work of Peter Jackson. The direction, though this is Rivers' directorial debut, is weak, though as an opening film it is very strong, but it isn't strong enough t sustain this 100 million+ feature. The screenplay, might I say is quite substandard. I was bitterly disappointed with the narrative, yes it is fun and a good watch, but that is only sustained by the visuals and interesting premise. Though the script uses many of Jacksons', Boyens' and Walsh's flairs, mannerisms and quirks, it really is far below their other work, a far cry from even the Hobbit trilogy just earlier this decade. Back again to Rivers' direction, for most of his career he as been working with visuals or as a second unit director, not using actors for full performances, thus I understand why the dialogue and inter-character interactions in this film feel weak and at worst forced, he simply was inexperienced, thus the film feels weak since its very foundation was undernourished.The performances were just fine. They certainly weren't great. Hugo Weaving certainly stands out as the fierce Thaddeus Valentine. He clearly was having a lot of fun with the role, and makes for a convincing villain, I'd say probably better than most of the drossy and weak villains from MCU features. Hera Hilmar as Hester Shaw was just fine, really just fine. Her performance wasn't anything special, nor was it bad, at times it felt a little forced but as the film played out it certainly became more relaxed, and I would say improved. Robert Sheehan as Tom Natsworthy was underdeveloped due to the screenplay, but was decently performed. Jihae as Anna Fang was fun, definitely a welcome addition. Also the cameo by Mark Hadlow during the second act was a welcome surprise. Stephen Lang as Shrike was a good part of the narrative, definitely a stronger section.But the visuals in the feature was simply astonishing. The effects were strong, convincing and didn't look fake, Rivers' career work in visual effects clearly shows. For this film has extremely strong technical elements. The set design too was spectacular, on the level of Weta workshops previous work, costume design was fantastic. I have absolutely no complaints about how this film looks, for it eminently good. The cinematography was very clear and fun, colouration complimented the amazing visuals very well, and its pans across landscapes were captivating. While the rest of the angles were fairly normal, it pleased me greatly in other aspects. The sound design was extremely well crafted, subtle and loud, a grand soundscape, very well balanced, and intricately crafted. The technical features of this film are astonishing, truly some of the years best, on a level worthy of immense praise, and it is a great tragedy that this features narrative let it down so badly.This film was a wondrous success in certain aspects, and fell flat in others. As a fan of Peter Jackson I am happy too see the visual style is present, but the narrative shortfalls and lack of characterisation, character growth or engaging confrontations in a great disappointment, it is downright weak.On the other hand, the character of Shrike, the undead cyborg creature was highly captivating. Portrayed by Stephen Lang, it was a morally intricate, and philosophically intriguing sub-plot. The interaction between Shrike and Hester Shaw was this films real character, and could have served more deeply, and been used more wisely, in replacement of the supposed romance that comes out of the blue or slew of deeply useless and forgettable secondary characters. This was certainly the films strongest aspect from a narrative and screenplay perspective, a perspective upon which I place great emphasis.Overall this film was a mixed bag of results, with alright performances but weak direction and screenwriting, despite the tremendous potential of the source material, concept and talent in the production. But in the end it was still fair popcorn entertainment, propped u by incredible production values, and Hugo Weaving's captivating villain, and of course the odd cameo from Chudleigh Pomeroy. I give it a generous 6/10",Mortal Engines

377,ZombieGirlORV,Another Botched Work of Literature,2,14 December 2018,"I have a few questions. First, and most importantly, where was Dog? Why did Bevis have hair? Where was the poo tank? Why did Tom and Bevis know each other? WTF? Why was Kate blond, hair dye and wigs really aren't that expensive when you're dealing with an entire movie budget, are they? Why was Bevis rude to Kathrin when they first met? In the book he was shy, sweet, and kind and put others before himself. It seems like they just picked a handsome looking guy and called him Bevis a few times and hoped that the audience would be okay with it. Why was Tom tutoring Katherine at the beginning? Why did they already know what Medusa was from the very beginning? That made the storyline feel rushed. Why did Hester have two eyes, and why was she pretty, when in the book she was described as hideous? WTF does Hollywood have against ugly people? She was supposed to have: ""A terrible scar ran down her face from forehead to jaw, making it look like a portrait that had been furiously crossed out. Her mouth was wrenched sideways in a permanent sneer, her nose was a smashed stump, and her single eye stared at him out of the wreckage, as gray and chill as a winter sea."" Couldn't they have taken some of the money from a few of the useless special effects scenes they added in, and just made her a look a little more like the book described? We came to see an adaptation of a creative and wonderful book, not some overdrawn out action scenes. Why did so many people who were supposed to die at the end live, and someone who was supposed to live die? Why did the ending turn into Star Wars, with him flying the ship inside to shoot at the weak point, while Hester was up on the platform having an 'I am your father' moment? That never happened in the book. (While he mentioned the possibility of it to Kate, he never knew for sure.) Why was Valentine mad with power while the Mayor was trying to stop him? Think you got some rolls mixed up here. Why did Valentine abandon Kate when in the book it was clear she was the most important thing to him? Why did Hollywood have to take a unique and imaginative story like this and butcher it to all hell? Honestly, if you want to make a loud action movie that's just like every other action movie regurgitated from the bowels of Hollywood that's one thing, but this was a fantastically imaginative and original work of literature which was taken and cut down and obscured worse than Hester's face, until it was almost unrecognizable. None of it remotely resembled the book aside from the names and titles they used. It wouldn't have hurt the budget to try and get a few of the things right. This book had truly tragic and defining moments in it, which were snipped away for reasons I'll never understand. Most of what was wrong with this movie had nothing to do with the actors' abilities and everything to do with decisions made overall. It gets right down to the real question. What problem does the workers of Hollywood have with bringing across a true recreation? Why must they always botch the job? If it is truly that difficult, have the writer come in, or even a fan who's read the book, and ask them while filming if you're doing it right. Have them look over the script, and at each of the characters to make sure they're brought about correctly. Had you told me before I went to see this movie that it was a Hollywood action movie and had all the names and titles been changed so that it was its own animal. I might have liked it. But it wasn't, it was advertised as an adaptation of the book, as a retelling of story which is already on page, and as such the creators have a responsibility to that storyline, the already existing fan base, and to the writer who created the work of art to begin with. They have a responsibility to get it done properly and keep it to the book. You wouldn't draw a clown face over the Mona Lisa and call it your own creation. It would be completely disrespectful to Da Vinci, and terrifying to look at. In effect, that is exactly what we have with this movie. Next time you want to create an original work of art, use a canvas that hasn't been worked on yet. Leave the world of literature free of your botchery. I'm giving this 2 stars. One for the actors work, and one for the imagery, because London did look exactly as it was described.",Mortal Engines

Unfortunately, the budget didn't extend to ensuring the screenplay would hold up, too. This screenplay would have made for a fun, B-level sci-fi actioner, but just wasn't up to blockbuster standards. And this is truly unfortunate, considering that producer Peter Jackson had purchased the film rights to the YA novels almost ten years before the release of Mortal Engines.The mostly unknown cast is forgettable, and even the solid performance of Hugo Weaving can't help. You'll feel literally no empathy for any of the characters, and the mostly CGI Shrike is especially annoying in a growly, unpleasant way.Mortal Engines lost the studio a reported 175 million, it's easily one of the biggest, fattest turkeys in Hollywood's history.

The cities and how they are rendered on film (although owing a lot to the Magical world of JK Rowling) are magnificent and very beautifully shot.The CGI is absolutely perfect and the steampunk creations are given just enough explanation and use just enough recognisable 'tech' to feel authentic and kind of possible.The Music shares more than a few bars with the LOTR Trilogy soundtrack and huge 'chunks' of the story (and many of the set pieces) are lifted straight out of the original StarWars Trilogy.Sadly the film isn't quite the sum of its parts and I can clearly see why many reviewers have described it as an attempt at a Steampunk StarWars Movie. The biggest issue for me was that I couldn't warm to the two lead actors and the supporting cast were underused and thrown away too easily but overall the film was enjoyable enough.Unlike 'The Golden Compass""' butchering of 'His Dark Materials' which are wonderful books there are plenty of ideas and moments in the Mortal Engines film to suggest the books are probably really good. I think if the film at least serves to draw more of an audience to the source material rather than spawn a new sci-fi fantasy franchise then it's still done something good.If you like films like Maze Runner and , I guess, StarWars then you might enjoy this.",Mortal Engines

390,jp7570,Well-done CGI cannot save a derivative and all-too-familiar plot,2,10 June 2019,"I just watched Mortal Engines on a flight. I'm thinking the studio heads at Universal had a conversation that went something like this (SPOILERS AHEAD):""Get me a British version of Justin Long and a younger Kristen Stewart - maybe from somewhere exotic (like Iceland). Then we'll put them in a rag-tag rebel alliance fighting an evil madman with an ultimate weapon - it worked for Star Wars. Oh, and let's have a Morpheus-type, but make it an enigmatic Asian woman. Oo, oo, what if the girl was actually related to the main villain, like Luke and Vader? And let's set it all in a global wasteland where food and fuel are scarce - you know, like Mad Max. And get Hugo Weaving - we always use him"".That sort of hits the highlights of this parts-bin movie. It's made up of everything you've seen before. Even a scene at the end when the two young would-be lovers gaze into each other's eyes on a prow of a flying something-or-other (not really a plane, looks more like a flying bra). That gauzy scene is straight out of Titanic.Aside from a Brexit joke and some obvious Universal Studio plugs (Minions), Mortal Engines literally runs out of gas. It's Stars Wars/Mad Max/Titanic/Matrix (with a little Lord of the Rings), but you don't really care about the leads at all, or the story, or anything. The two main leads are likable and oh-so-predictable, but you don't really care about them. And why was there only one major city rolling? (Yes, rolling.). What happened to the rest? Maybe the source material was better than this film, which resembled a Doctor Who episode from 10 yeas ago.Peter Jackson and his team know how to make CGI visuals - the director is one of Jackson's storyboard artists, so it seems there was a lot of emphasis on getting the visuals right. The characters and story? Not so much.",Mortal Engines
391,filmismagic,"If you haven't read the novels, you might enjoy it.",5,21 December 2018,"Probably the first thing that struck me about both, audience's and critics' responses is that many seem to have not read the original Mortal Engines novel. While it's a truth universally acknowledged that film adaptations differ from their source material, I don't see that as reason alone to bash a film. If anything, movies have the potential to reach heights the original novel could not. It doesn't happen often but there have been moments, and when I first heard about Mortal Engines and Peter Jackson producing it I was hoping they create something REALLY special with this excellent story. I know it's a bit of meme by now to hear fans of the novels bash their film versions, but believe me it's not something I would do unless I had some very good reasons. Mortal Engines (2018) is one such example, sadly enough.To briefly sum up the plot, the movie takes place in a post-apocalyptic Europe affected by a tragic disaster and war. Because of this most iconic cities and towns are now running on engines and wheels in order to scavenge for valuable resources and survive. Tom, a historian from London, through unfortunate circumstances bands with Hestor, a scavenger and outcast, who wants to avenge her mother's death by assassinating Thaddeus Valentine, the Head of London's Guild of Historians, who intends to solve London's dilemmas by acquiring an ancient weapon that can help the city penetrate a Shield Wall that no other city succeeded in doing.The original novel was made for children, but it still had a lot of dark and complex themes throughout. Much was left ambiguous, but you at least were given some details of what drove the world into the state it is in now and the politics it produced. Both Hester and Tom were flawed individuals that made decisions that constantly caused distrust in their relationship, yet I understood why they stuck together and didn't root for one over the other. In the movie, they were just both annoying and acted stupidly at times or made decisions without any clear motive. I just could not identify with either of them here, even when knowing details about them that the film doesn't tend to address. Oh, also the usual movie trope where all of a sudden they ""love"" each other, despite knowing each other for so little time during which one of them tries robbing the other assuming that they're dead.The thing that bugged me the most was that the novel had many great and surprising moments. Not only did they not appear in the movie, but they were even REPLACED with cliché situations. Apologies but MASSIVE spoiler in next several lines: Example, the main villain's daughter in the book has a much more relevant role, and even gets indirectly killed by him, causing him guilt that is only barely redeemed by him helping the protagonists escape while he stays with his dead daughter as the entire city gets destroyed. In the movie, the villain is too black-white and dies a villainous death while his gorgeous blonde daughter ends up surviving with the majority of London. This is just one of several examples where intense moments are changed for no clear reason, other than to dumb things down for a more family-friendly audience I guess. For something Peter Jackson produced, I'm amazed this turned out to be the case. I never read the original Lord Of The Rings books so could not judge how faithful he stayed to them as he directed his trilogy. What I can say however is that the films kept me engaged and had a lot of twists and turns that I wasn't expecting. While not without faults, those films were anything but cliché. Even if I hadn't read the Mortal Engines novel prior, I'd still be disappointed by the storyline in this movie and how predictable it is.I've stopped trusting film critics a long time ago, but sadly this is one case where some of them are actually right. It puzzles me that Philip Reeves (the author) would give such positive response to this watered-down, PC version of his astonishing story. Still, in a sad age of cinema that's overloaded with superheroes, remakes, reboots and sequels, Mortal Engines really is a breath of fresh air. It portrays a world that hasn't really been done before and always looks visually stunning throughout. For that alone I can see why those going into it blind would be so captivated by it, and is why I generously give it 2.5/5. But as an adaptation, it just isn't a very good movie. The world's lore is very underplayed and the adventure is too predictable and dumbed down. Retaining most of the book's complexity wouldn't have necessarily made the movie longer or above a PG-13 rating, so why the producers and filmmakers settled for this result really puzzles me. If you decide to go see it, I strongly encourage you to borrow the book (and its sequels) from a library afterwards. I know it's common to hear ""Read the book!"" from die-hard fans, but trust me; if you stick to the movie you'll miss out on some truly wonderful stories and adventures that the world of Mortal Engines has to offer.",Mortal Engines
392,VVMini,"Awesome concept, poor everything else",4,9 March 2019,"The concept of a post apocalyptic wasteland where giant cities on wheels hunt eachother is a really cool one that instantly drew me to this movie. Unfortunately, watching 'Mortal Engines' it quickly becomes clear that behind this awesome facade is yet another generic and predictable 'little guy stands up against the evil and corrupt overlords' mess of a story.The movie starts out well enough, with a cool opening chase sequence that demonstrates the rules of this post-apocalyptic world. However, the whole 'city vs city' concept gets thrown overboard pretty quickly, and the biggest draw of the movie just becomes a side notion that isn't developed properly. It gets overtaken by a 'Terminator' style storyline that isn't bad in and of itself, but it too is abandoned halfway, while the movie trods along to a predictable, entirely computer generated climactic battle. It should have the Shrike storyline as the main focus of the movie throughout, or just leave that aside to give more room to developing this potentially fascinating world and its inhabitants. Instead, it feels like an awkward jumble of several half-developed stories.It's clear that all the money went into the CGI, and they had to rely on lesser known actors. While they don't do a poor job per se, they do nothing to make the characters stand out in anyway, and the actors are almost as generic and bland as the characters they are portraying. As for where all that money did go, visually it looks good enough for an almost entirely computer generated movie. I can't really see how they could have made this movie without relying so much on CGI, so I can't exactly fault them for it, but it does look a bit too much like a videogame or an animated movie at times.While 'Mortal Engines' has proven to be a dud, I have to give it credit for trying to make a high budget original sci-fi movie that isn't about superheroes. It's just a shame that such an awesome concept has been almost entirely negated by a messy, convoluted, and underdeveloped story. It's an even bigger shame that this is coming from the same minds behind the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. I'm worried a failure this size might be the death of their ambitions as big budget film makers, which would be a shame because they've clearly demonstrated their skills in the past. Let's hope this is the low point they need to push themselves to better things. Then at least something good will have come from it.",Mortal Engines

Did they really have to make the characters so much older? And Hester's scar?! Much of her character building was based around that scar.

The good parts:
as everyone else mentioned in their reviews: the visuals/CGI. Beautiful scenery and sets, vibrant colors, spectaculars battles, very good cinematographyvery dynamic. There is almost non stop action and anticipation. No bathroom time.strong performance of Hugo Weavingstrong performance of Stephen Lang and CGI team for Shrike characterNow, if you think of the movie as a modern fairy tale for children and teenagers than it is more than ok. If you expect more...
Well, here are the bad things:
the concept itself lacks any logic. After a world war destroys the advanced stage of evolution the humanity have reached, the remaining humans build huge mobile islands on land that move on tracks or wheels or legs to scavenge... something. While others build a great city defended by a wall.as others have mentioned, the movie tries to fit a lot of things from the books in two hours and it fails. The characters have no depth, no complexity and there is no real emotional attachment to themtoo much resemblance to Mad Maxthere are no big names involved except for Hugo Weaving and of course Peter Jackson as a writerthe plot is predictable, with holes and its main purpose is to justify the action and special effects. Annoying cliches both in characters, lines and story (the wise old Asian, the warrior girl, etc). Oh and yeah, SPOILER ALERT there is a genuine ""I am your father"" moment...However the movie manages to entertain. It is a pity it was a box office flop. Probably because of the concept itself which is hard to sell, the lack of efficient marketing, the bad critic reviews and mostly the lack of big names that would draw interest. Not to mention the competition with other movies launched in the same period such as Aquaman.Conclusion: you will not regret seeing the movie if you want to see a visually stunning modern fairy tale.

He should be that awesome guy, who wants only a technological advancements for his people, but something happend (maybe in pas) and he couldn't deal with it normally, so he bacame an evil guy -- no, here it is SAID he's evil and that's the reason he is -- but for me, it isn't good reason at all.Main characters, other than villian, are just archetypal heroes, boy, girl, who don't like each other at the first and (of course) love each other later and so on, cliché on and on and on...I think this movie is ""fine,"" but those chlichés just killed it (for me).",Mortal Engines

I recently watched Alien: Covenant and i can already say that movie was way better than this one.The two main characters, a girl named Hester and a guy named Tom have ZERO chemistry. It is cringeworthy when they try to put on this romance between them. The dialogue is stupid, lots of cliches and tropes, predictable as all hell. There is nothing interesting.The world is stupid, or at least not explained well. Why do these moving cities even want that the ""anti tractionists"" are keeping from them? And why does that make them ""bad"" and the ""anti tractionists"" good? No idea. Why do these moving cities exists in the first place? And why is this post apocalyptic world so green and vibrant, and seem full of life?The plot just sort of happens, and the viewer couldnt care less. The main character, Hester, is introduced so casually. Its like, oh there is some girl with a red hood. She is running around trying to look serious. And she wants something. Oh kay. Oh look a giant tractor/ city thing. Oh random rivalry between two guys and a girl that leads to nothing. Oh exposition about stuff i dont care about, that still isnt properly explained.There are details with other characters that go nowhere. And new characters are introduced so randomly throughout the movie, and they all suck. It is like they read a book with a whole bunch of characters, and they want all the characters in the movie so they can be ""faithful"" to the book. But the characters end up being next to useless in every way.There is this cool robot character, but he is like all other characters. Stupid. He wants to chase Hester until the end of the world over something silly, it is just so stupid.The acting is bad, and the dialogue isnt making things better. Hugo Weaving, the Tom boy, and the robot were the only decent actors. And that chinese woman was pretty okay, but she said so many cringey things.It is pretty creative though. It looks cool. It has cool desgns. I personally have my own fantasy/ steampunk ideas, and this movie provided a lot of visual inspiration to me. It is obvious that a lot of money and talent was dumped into this movie.

414,haydenagain,Not the perfect beginning for the Mortal Engines Quartet like I expected.,6,5 May 2019,"The clash of urban titans has arrived to the big screen in this latest review for Mortal Engines. Does this movie live up to the book and the lore? Well let's get started.Plot:In a Dystopian future world ruined by an ancient apocalypse, gigantic Mobile Cities now dominant the landscape. Battling each other for survival and remaining resources. While those that choose to avoid it live behind a gigantic wall in eastern Asia called Shan Guao. Drawn together by an unexpected turn of Events, Hester Shaw and Tom Natsworthy are cast out of the Traction City of London into the wastes of the Great Hunting ground. Now must rely on each other to survive. As they find their way back to London, a cybernetic Bounty Hunter begins a relentless manhunt upon them.Likes:Mortal Engines is an epic, innovative and visual fuelled sci-fi adventure never before realised in filmmaking. The designs of the moving cities are really captivating and thoroughly detailed. Especially how London has a lot of striking resemblances to its real-world counterpart.
The special effects and the environment overall are stunning and breath-taking. And the action is thrilling, suspenseful and high-octane from start to finish. I also love how accurately London devours cities, just like how I imagined it in the first chapter. And the film is actually a lot faithful to the novel in terms of characters and setting unlike most other books to film.
The casting choices for the movie are pretty solid such as Hera Hilmar as Hester Shaw, Robert Sheehan as Tom Natsworthy, Hugo Weaving as Valentine and Stephen Lang as the Cyborg Shrike. Who (except for Valentine, see the dislikes below) do stay true to their characters from the novels. Stephen Lang's portrayal of the Cyborg bounty hunter Shrike is probably my biggest highlight. He gives Shrike plenty of good vibe and a sense of humanity and character when most of the others can't really grasp that interest.
But really that's all the good I have to say this film has on a visual aspect. But the Dislikes? Well... they do outweigh the needs of the few.Dislikes:So like I said I have read the book before seeing this movie recently and firstly, it doesn't truly follow the full length of it. The first half is mostly accurate to the book but after the main leads get captured by a slave town and being saved by Anna Fang that's where the story starts getting condensed for time.
From there, it tries to attempt to recreate popular themes and moments that relate too heavily upon Star Wars or Mad Max content. For example the Anti-Traction Leagues final assault on London (Not in the Book) which has a large resemblance to certain scenes in A New Hope and Return of the Jedi. So not an original movie as one was to expect.The book followed three leads. Tom, Hester and Katherine Valentine. Both of them had an equal view of the events that transpire in the novel. But the movie is too concerned about a budget and a long running time to fully adapt everything that it removes the important aspects of the characters and climatic moments witnessed:1.) Katherine doesn't die in the end. Her pet husky, Dog is missing also.2.) London itself doesn't get destroyed by Medusa.3.) Tom and Hester's romance is rarely ever seen and aren't captured by another Town called Tunbridge.4.) Medusa is used first on the Shield Wall and not first used on a German city called Panzerstadt like in the Novel.5.) How Mobile Cities conserve resources for fuel without consuming them too quickly is also left unexplained.
And those were moments that fans of the book remember so well but Christian Rivers and Peter Jackson had missed and that's really shallow. If the movie was 40 minutes longer, then maybe it could have adapted the full story.
A few of the characters from the book are not properly portrayed as I hoped. Mainly with Anna Fang, Valentine and Hester herself. Anna Fang appears to be edgier and distasteful of people from Traction cities than her calm and nicer counterpart. Her personality and lines are a bit mechanical to get any connection to her or her motivations as an Anti-Tractionist.
Thaddeus Valentine is THE main villain instead of Magnus Chrome who both show a sudden switch in personalities where the Mayor despises the use of Medusa and not the latter. And he is much more of a fanatic and a power-hungry dictator and even does cynical Out-of-Character moves like try to bash all of London and its people to their death just to kill A FREAKING WALL? By the way, his plan is stupid. All he boasts about is destroying the Shield Wall and killing Anti-Tractionists. But what's the reason bro? In the movie, London isn't dying like in the book, and seems to run on enough power and resources to keep going on without quarrelling with other cities. So why kill a bunch of normal innocent people anyway regardless? It just feels far too personal to understand. So to put it mildly, his character is too underdeveloped and ludicrously insane to be taken seriously as the villain. But at least Hugo Weaving did well with the material he had to work with anyway.
I wouldn't say Hester Shaw's personality is not much like her counterpart in literature. But it's that small scar on the left side of her jaw that's the problem here. In the books she is described as being a battered sixteen year old girl with a long scar that appears over her left eye, nose and right chin. That is disappointing even from a Hollywood point of view because she could have had that scar easy without having to worry about ruining the actresses' beauty. Or you could just have it cutting over her left side of the face instead no problem. But Jackson, the scar is not strong with this one!
So I hope that wasted too much book to film criticism I included.Verdict?
When push comes to shove, Mortal Engines delivers an all new visual, steam-punked action adventure of survival that does do well to keep faith to its source material. But like most other book-to-film adaptations, it removes too much flow from the story and pacing of the book in order to be congested for time just to strive to compete with the bigger leagues of today's filmmaking world. If Peter Jackson himself was in the director's chair, maybe he could have been able to do better at adapting the movie. But I don't think it would have made much of a difference regardless. In the meantime, it looks like fans may have to wait a little while longer until The Mortal Engines Quartet gets a proper adaption. Hopefully with better results.
I give Mortal Engines a 6/10.",Mortal Engines
415,thetalich,It's complicated,6,15 February 2019,"STORY:
The story in this movie was the weakest point. You just can't expect for us to relate and to feel something for some characters or even the whole world ( movie world ) if you don't give us a big backstory. It's simple as that. The whole formula was show a main character ( give him 1 minute time for the backstory ) then switch to the current events. That doesn't work. And ofcourse, we didn't care about those characters. The same goes for the plot of this movie. They filled ( writters ) the movie with events that occure the main characters, bad events and espect for us to find that intresting. There 3 books as I see for this movie and I can presume that the writers took all of the good things from those and put it in one place. That will make your audience to not know what the heck is going on.Directing/Editing/Music/CostumographyThe director showed us a stunning world. With a lot of details. Visually i enjoyed this movie. And with all that music going in the background, it was just phenomenal in some scenes. But again, NO CONNECTION TO THE STORY ! And about the costumes. They were believable, like they were from that world.
Hera, Hugo and Robert had a decent performance. But Sarah Peirse, Jihae and Menik Gooneratne made me cringe so much ( Sarah the most ).",Mortal Engines

But, not with the plot, some part different. Hmm I prefer movie plot, more efficient, but it collided with my imagination after red the book, strange feeling, a little bit confusing. So yes, that's the weakness of this story.If I didn't read the book, maybe 8/10",Mortal Engines

Which is the reason why I give the movie 4 stars and not just 1, which is what it deserves if we look at acting and plot.Because the rest is so cheesy as to border on grotesque. The number of times people jumped off impossible heights and did not get as much as a scratch when they should have broken half their bones? A simplistic portrayal of good versus evil as if the movie is made for 5-year-olds? Impossible chains of events working, time and again, in favour of the protagonists? Heroics bordering on stupidity?MOST importantly, having to watch Robert Sheehan contort his mouth and make pathetic faces for TWO hours??? Having seen him in Misfits and being aware of his tremendous acting range, it pains me to see him in this role.

424,james-218-791197,Pretty bad. Like a cheesy mash up of LOTR and Mad Max.,3,22 November 2020,"I must admit the trailer left my a little cold, but a rating of over 6 on IMDB made me give it a go. And Hugo Weaving wouldn't put his name to something bad, would he? In hindsight, I'd struggle to find a worse way to spend 2 hours.Ok the positives - the steampunk style is actually pretty cool. And... well that's that it.The film feels rushed - which is odd for Peter Jackson who somehow managed to stretch The Hobbit over 3 intensity long and drawn out films. With such a large cast, there's little time spent getting to know the characters except Hester and Tom - he's a limp dishcloth and she's a petulant child. You don't feel anything for the cast at all - they are massively superficial. The only character I felt anything for was the cyborg, Shrike.The CGI, which others have raved about, is so artificial, it makes Star Wars: The Phantom Menace look realistic. It looks like a computer game. It's so polished you can't take it seriously,I'm not massively against the plot, but it feels thin and obvious. There's no surprises. You don't sit up and think, ""wow"". At times, it's just stupid. Ok, the fact that while cities are romping around powered by steam engines doesn't set a high bar, but building some sort of quantum energy weapon inside St Paul's is just utterly ridiculous. And it just ends. Abruptly.On the whole, it feels like a cringeworthy mash up of Mad Max and Lord of the Rings. I can't understand why anyone could give this film a good rating - it just has so very little to offer.It is truly atrocious.",Mortal Engines

I watched the movie and then i came here to give 8 as vote (i gave 9 for this big cheat ai've found out), and i was really surprised that this beautiful movie was rated 6.2 .So i've scrolled about 300 reviews and i kept noticing same identical titles...same content...different users...absolutely bad and nonsense votes.Who could ever take advantage of this?

Once I stopped overthinking the real world challenges of such things, I was able to kick back and enjoy the story.I think, having not read the books, that I missed some things. There was a LOT of world-building that this movie had to do and do fast, which is not easy. Consequently, some things (plotlines, characters) felt a little rushed. However, it made me want to go grab the books and read those details that couldn't get put into the movie.Visually, this movie is breathtaking. Just gorgeous, which is not unexpected given Peter Jackson. And I feel that the actors all did a fantastic job with their roles. I was so drawn to Hester and her story. I can't wait to read about it.I wish it could have been maybe 30-45 minutes longer? I think that would have helped with fleshing out some of the character relationships which would have made some of the later events in the movie more meaningful.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie and look forward to seeing it again when I get it on video.",Mortal Engines

Poor story, poor conflicts, poor details.The movie had really good visuals/graphics, and intriguing mechanics and physics. Good musics and actions. Pretty much everything to draw you into enjoying a movie. However, a single bad apple spoils the basket, or in this case, multiple bad cases. If you're into having a normal pass in time, the movie's fine, but if you're trying to find a good movie to watch, this one isn't the one.One of the important character is a badass. Over the top action hero, perhaps too over the emphasis. Kung fu master with a gun... quite the boring spectacle. They also wear a outfit similar to a white tuxedo and that clothing, while attentive, is out of place and is immune to dirt and damage.
Next important character has an amazing story to them. This character is also a super strong character, but goes out in pathetic way... yeah nothing else to talk about because the character is an important detail, makes a cameo and leaves.
Finally foreign marketing. Some movies blends continental products well, some movies have small details that sticks out a bit, and some movies shoves it in your face.Definitely a rushed project or a compacted movie to fit everything in before the time limit. Lots of cheesy moments that shows the good people have everything going good for them. However, awesome graphics and designs in the movie made it just bearable to enjoy .",Mortal Engines

449,reeltimeflicks-81729,Great CGI; Ok Story; One Dimensional Characters,7,24 January 2019,"There is much to like about this film. The CGI is excellent, and quite immersive with several wide angle shots that will make you feel small in the world--which is great for adventure/epics. The film also has excellent fast-paced chase sequences where you will wish you can slow down time to be able to absorb every little detail of the scenes. My biggest issues with this film are with the character design and development, not enough to hate the film, but enough to make you wish the producers/writers had put just a little more effort into fleshing out and giving believable reactions to on-screen events. The female lead did pretty good in performing somebody that had a rough upbringing and is out for vengeance, there were a few moments where she behaves contrary to how she has been portrayed, but they were sparse. The male lead was a bumbling idiot. He seemed like a dumber version of Newt Scamander from the Fantastic Beasts movies. In some scenes, I feel he was trying too hard to be clueless, and end result was unbelievable. He also ends up having the biggest unwarranted character development, a complete personality reversal that just doesn't seem possible based on what he goes through in the movie in a matter of a day. Hugo Weaving, playing the villain, performs stellar as usual, out-shining all the others in the cast by a large margin. I wouldn't be surprised if members of the audience looked forward to his scenes more than anything else in the movie. Most of all, though, the movie failed to provide a sufficient emotional investment to its characters. This is a problem when the characters get hurt or die and the audience doesn't care. Film also doesn't do a good job of giving a credible backstory of how the world ended up being the way it is, the audience is left to piece together a rudimentary understanding of the setting, place, and time from mumbling dialog and snap shots of maps with future city names and coastlines. Even by the end of the film I had a little better understanding of the locations being referenced by the characters than at the beginning.In conclusion however, it is entirely possible to forgive the character design flaws and lackluster world-building and enjoy this 2-hour epic journey.",Mortal Engines

Unfortunately this is basically the only notably good thing in the film, the music is unremarkable, the two lead roles are enjoyable enough characters but honestly (and somewhat ironically) the only character you actually care about as the film goes on is an undead cyborg who even then is kinda shoe-horned into the plot and ultimately serves the purpose of a throwaway plot device, everyone else in the film with the exception of the lead two, the bad guy and the asian chick are completely unnecessary (one character has a heavy introduction right at the start then literally does not appear again for the entire film until the very last scene and even then does absolutely nothing, its very very bizarre.)The biggest problem with the film though is after you get about half an hour in you basically know whats going to happen for the entire rest of the film, the ""twists"" are so mind-numbingly obvious due to over-exposition and massive foreshadowing; The film constantly does this ""insert a quick snapshot of X into this scene"" i'm assuming with the hopes of being clever and hoping to provide the audience with a gasping moment of revelation later on, instead it comes across very bluntly, if subtitled it might as well read ""X Y and Z are gonna be important later on"".The finale is extremely odd, the film basically spends absolutely AGES on this one scene that could (and should) only last about 10 seconds, and then it ends, then ends again, and again, and again, and you reach the point of disillusionment, you literally just don't care about any character whatsoever.One for the DVD collection maybe, as I think for younger teens they would probably find it pretty cool and enjoyable, for everyone else though its pretty dull. 4/10.",Mortal Engines

480,IliescuVictor,Amazing CGI for a steampunky like Mad Max movie,8,9 December 2018,"I had little to no plans for watching this movie before its release but I had to choose between this and Robin Hood and I made a good choice.
First of all, the movie is visually stunning, not only is Peter Jackson involved but Weta Digital is behind the Visual Effects here and oh boy, they did an amazing job. Its for the first time we see motorised cities hunting other cities on the big screen, everything about this movie is good in its way. The sheer size of the cities, the mechanised components and the tense atmosphere transport you in that desolated world. The CGI is amazing, the score is fantastic (props for Junkie XL on this one). It combines more famous series like Star Wars, Mad Max or Terminator but with a more retro and steampunky theme. I know its after the first novel in a series written by Philip Reeve so I do hope for a follow up.
The story is not cliche free, its too predictible at some points, there is not much character development and the villain played by Hugo Weaving is driven by an objective that we've seen hundreds of times already.
But I say all those flaws are saved by the visuals of the movie and the soundtracks. You can deffinitely feel Peter Jackson's involvment in this project, as some of the cinematography and scenery looks straight out of Lotr or Hobbit.
I recommend watching it on the biggest screen you can go to, preferably IMAX.",Mortal Engines
481,kiwijinxter,"Unexpectedly, surprisingly good!",9,27 December 2018,"Steampunk Star Wars. That's what I thought when I watched this movie. Mortal Engines is a little bit like Star Wars in that it creates an entire (steampunk) world from scratch and introduces us to a whole bunch of new, nuanced characters whom we are unfamiliar with, all of them with some backstory, which makes things interesting. It's a whole new world.What I really like about the world of Mortal Engines is that it is unlike any other worlds I've seen before in the movies, so the mechanics of the world is totally different. It's a semi-post apocalyptic world, with a hint of dystopia (yet not dark like many of the modern boring dystopian movies we see today) coupled with a dash of hope and humanity. On the one hand you have the humans which, true to life, want to destroy each other and then on the other hand you have the unquenchability of the human spirit found in steampunk itself told through what is likely the coolest steampunk character I've seen in the movies, Shrike (I won't spoil it for you, but you'll know what I mean when you see the movie).With Weta's involvement and Peter Jackson & co, it is no surprise how real they managed to create this steampunk world, in excellent CGI glory. London on wheels is simply so cool and intimidating. The actors all fit into this world well. I reckon they could make this movie even more interesting by fleshing out the characters quite a bit more. All in all, it is simply such a cool movie. Personally, this is one of the most unexpected movies I've seen in 2018 and it is a pleasant surprise, being so different from the other movies. I love it, my kids loved it too. Highly recommended.",Mortal Engines

I found the characters engaging and that I could emphasise with them. I actually found the casting good - and could not think of any actor that I would replace.As others have said, the film is dynamic and keeps you enthralled throughout and the CGI and special effects are done well.By the time the credits rolled I felt I'd been thoroughly entertained - and if they made any more films of the subsequent books would certainly go and see them.",Mortal Engines

Yep it's bonkers and at time pretentious, it's overwrought but once you let go the stupid moving cities it's enjoyable B grade fun.
Acting is mostly A grade.
Hugo Weaving at his maniacal best, but not overdone as could have been.
Robert Sheehan (Klaus in Umbrella Academy) is perfectly cast.
Great action fights from Jihae Kim.
Strike the undead killing machine actually has more heart and pathos(and story development) than most the other characters.
And Hera Hilma as Hester Shaw does a good job as the main character.
Also good to see my favourite Martian Marine (Frankie Adams) in a bit role.
In other ways it is crap, derivative script, rediculous idea of ravenous cities and unexplained ""old tech"" ( from our time) and no real explanation of what happened to the world that caused this madness. Ok would take too long but a bit more explaining would have been good. Ending is boringly predictable as well.
I'm sure the books explained a lot more.

(Think French sci-fi - unpopular opinion, I'm sure).However, the movie finds its footing in the second half once we are introduced to the most interesting characters, Shrike (an undead android) and Jihae (an androgynous heroine).

511,senderik,Basically Star Wars on Wheels,5,24 March 2019,"The effects of this movie are great although with today's computers almost anything is possible. The story is as Implausible as it is unoriginal and thin. The city of London has been equipped with a set of tracks and is lumbering away on the post apocalyptic plains of what I assume is Post Brexit Britain. The shadowy ruler of London (not to be confused with the mayor who is (spoiler) killed after a brief appearance) played by mr Smith, Hugo Weaving, is busy with a project that officially is supposed to provide the city with energy. In reality however, he is making his evil dooms day weapon, turning London into a Death Star on Wheels. For some reason nobody questions him even though there must be lots of people working on the project as the real Death Star took enormous amounts of resources. The protagonist Tom (basically Luke Skywalker) has spent his life in London but dreams of going outside. You would think that with limited space, there the City would be more Canary Wharf and less quaint Victorian architecture but hey I'm no city planner. Even though the world outside the city is perfectly fine, people still want to live in this giant crowded mobile city, which even has retained the British Museum and St Paul's cathedral. For some reason, The emperor eehm, the London ruler Thaddeus, then decides to attack China because why not? In the mean time Princess Leia, eehm rebellion member Hester Shaw, tries to kill Thaddeus who apparently trusts the force to protect him as he has no body guards or security whatsoever, despite being the de facto ruler. Hester fails because Tom intervenes and after a brief chase she jumps into a garbage chute to escape the Storm Troopers. Oh wait, that was Star Wars again. She does jump though and after ends up outside. Tom tries to save her but obviously she doesn't want to be saved. Then Thaddeus appears (I guess a knife wound to the gut isn't as effective as a light sabre) and pushes Tom into the same chute because that's what evil Sith Lords do. Tom and Hester end up on the rebel base, which is between China and India after a lot of non connecting subplots that involve being rescued from scavengers, almost being sold in a slave market and Being rescued by an Asian woman. Oh, and Hester was raised by an undead robot to make the plot easier. The whole mess ends with London appearing near the Chinese wall (or something similar) that protects the revel base. Then Luke eehm Tom needs to fly his space eehm airship into the city to destroy the nuclear reactor that powers the Giant Dooms Day Beam. Has nobody ever thought of digging a moat instead of building a wall? Seems to me that stops you in your tracks much better. And the Death Star beam is great but only points forward. What wrong with attacking from behind? It really seems that the story was directly copied from several Star Wars plots, just the graphics are different.",Mortal Engines

They need fuel to roam the countryside looking for fuel. At least that's all the circular reasoning we get from the script to explain why mankind lifted London with a giant forklift onto an impressive chassis and retrofitted it with massive engines to roam the countryside looking for... but I repeat myself.As does the movie. One Deus Ex Machina in an otherwise okay flick I might overlook, but Mortal Engines pulls out all the stops and gives us two or three more. Our young hero (Robert Sheehan) is just about to be crushed into hero jelly by an enormous Southie machine out for a bit of night sport when suddenly a hatch opens in the earth beneath his boots and he falls into safety. Convenient. Later when our young heroine (Hera Hilmar) is on the verge of being sold to a fabulous and fierce looking sausage maker, Anna Fang (rebel leader, played by Jihae Kim who looks very stylish in her post-apocalyptic designer clothes) shows up and saves the day. A few minutes later when Shrike - a resurrected man and probably the most interesting character of all - is about to kill or kidnap the two teenies who are slowly falling in love as teenies must in these flicks, Anna once again shows up in the nick, this time flying the mandatory air machine made from butterfly thread and discarded toasters.Of course the villain (Hugo Weaving) is very villainous. He commands London as it bustles from place to place and at times he pretends to be good. But he's not very good at pretending to be good and his evil intentions to dominate the world are soon on display for all to see - and cheer.That's right. As Hugo The Mad is in the midst of slaughtering thousands upon thousands of innocent people who thought they were safe behind their wall (take that Trump!), people stand on the decks of London and shout praise, applauding the carnage. London! London!Good thing the ancients made a USB drive that stops the evil technology that Hugo re-booted. All that remains is for our heroine to do is plug it in and enter the passcode. Naturally, she has to fumble a bit and not get it right until there's less than one second left on the final countdown. Must be a Hollywood rule or something.All is well. Anna falls to her doom but not before she has a chance to show people her Hallmark card that says ""Not Afraid of Death Because My Spirit is Free"" and Hugo The Mad gets smashed to bad grape juice by his own city.Now the two teenie lovers are free to fly the magical airship into the sequel. The air is clear and the landscape breathtaking as they leave the wreckage and bodies behind. The hell with cleanup, they say. There are other cities to save, other villains to defeat. There are more movie tickets and popcorn to be sold.",Mortal Engines
517,davidmowbray-85035,What's wrong with Sci-fi?,7,23 November 2019,"Went into this film expecting nothing and knowing little, but it's Sci-fi so had to have a look. And what did I find? To be honest I found surprise, based on a whacky idea I'll admit but then how often does that happen in Sci-fi? Quite a lot over the decades.
So the basic plot is the world as we know it is destroyed so people now live in towns and cities that are mobile, imagine that, putting London on tracks! You do get the feeling that as the human race evolved after the end of the world and planning their future that they took a left instead of right, but you can't knock them for that.
Reading another review I noticed somebody say "" okay it has been panned for ripping off Star Wars but that's no reason bash the film "" personally to me if Mortal Engines is like any film it's Waterworld, only in this case substitute "" the smokers "" for London.
So is it worth watching? Now I've seen it I have to say yes, and I feel sure that if this had been made before any of the MCU came it would have been rated higher, is there anything wrong of course there is, the film poses far too many questions and gives too few answers, kind of makes you think they planned a sequel though it didn't make enough money for that, as a Sci-fi film I enjoyed it and will watch it again I can also see Mortal Engines becoming a cult film in time, I gave it seven stars and it's worth every one of them.",Mortal Engines

This is the most pure unadulterated fun I had at cinema since... Well, probably Mad Max. That isn't to say this movie is as close to perfection as Mad Max is.So why the perfect score? Well, for the first time in my IMDb voting history I'm not trying to be as rational as I can be, but just vote from the heart. And then came here to vote and saw its treated as your usual auto-generated fantasy blockbuster. I loved this movie, enjoyed every second of it. You can tell that there was a lot of work and passion put into making this movie look as cool as it can be. Set design and costumes add up to that unique steampunk look and feel that constantly made me go 'wow' , scene after scene. World buliding and even action at times reminded me of the first Star Wars trilogy. This is old school of filmmaking as it can be these days, and we need more of that.
And to top it off,some really solid to great performances all around. I really carred for the main cast, and there wasn't a second where they dropped the ball. That hasn't happened in awhile for something that's completely new. Story can get a bit predictable at times but again, it always keeps you invested. It's solid by any standard.The whole world is just amazing, original and I really hope they make another one to see more of it. Also : before our show there was the Aquaman trailer (they should call it spoilers at this point) that went on for 5 and half minutes and you get to see most plot points, scenes and a better and more original movie after it.",Mortal Engines

The visuals and CGI looked great and fun, realistic no, but it wasn't trying to be realistic. The images were a joy to look at. The character choices and plot moves were a bit unoriginal and predictable which was the weakest part of the movie in my opinion. But overall as a package its a pretty decent movie.

As a fan of the books, I understood everything that is going on and that probably helps a lot. But even without reading it, I still thought that it was not that hard to understand. The plot is constantly moving forward with a fast pace which I really love, it is hard to get bored. I don't give full marks because yes it looks a bit like start wars and the ending robed a plotline in the fourth book if they would continue with this saga (Which won't happen I know). The visuals are the best I have ever seen, apart from Star Wars. Junkie XL's score didn't disappoint me at all and gave me some of my favourite sounds I have ever heard. Over all I loved every single bit of it and it will be my favourite movie for a long time.

Seriously, cities on wheels? Obviously, the sheer power that Peter Jackson holds helped make this wasteful conceit.
Where does one begin with the ridiculousness?
1-The acting: moderate to terrible. Does Hugo Weaving ever tired of playing the same bad-guy character all the time?
All the actors were mediocre at best.
2-the directing- I know it's hard to hold a big mixture like this together but the direction was w/out merit but if I were a producer I'd seriously reconsider this director for a major project unless he was hobbled
by the producers and studio which is probable seeing the facile gripes in this stale work.
3-Script- sorry but the three writers wee def asleep on this one as there was nothing memorable in the script and clear laziness was at work here
4-cinematography- was visually ata dard w/lots of greys etc but again, standard work

Even the general premise seems quite original for cinema. And I was left with a feeling that there's a lot more to the world it's set in and the characters that you meet but you never get to find it out.The downsides, sadly, are more numerous to me. The characters generally seemed to lack depth and I didn't really care about them. For those familiar with the term ""chekhov's gun"", you may find the plot devices rather lazily added. During the action scene(s) near the end, there's an almost unrelenting string of clichés used which I found became quite hard to watch. As far as the antagonist goes - I have no idea what his motivation was and, if it was simply power, why it was directed in the way it seemed to be.Ultimately I think there were two main problems;Firstly, I don't think they knew who the target audience was - it wasn't mature enough to be adult but I also couldn't see young children liking it (or being allowed to see it as a '12' rated film by BBFC). That really leaves teenagers which suggests to me they've underestimated them - there's nothing relatable I can see for them and the plot is too shallow for it to be escapism.Secondly, it the story felt rushed and a hastily assembled event. It's like they came up with the idea of a moving city, then tried to build a story around it. If it had been made over several films and given the characters and story time to grow and develop, then I think they could have been onto something borderline classic.Overall a nice idea, but lacking production.",Mortal Engines

Turns out not even Peter Jackson could keep it from becoming a massive critical and financial failure. When I first saw the trailer, I was intrigued by the idea. My only hesitation was how overdone post-apocalyptic movies like this are. Still, the massively detailed special effects and small possibility of a hit were enough to get me to go see it. What I got was a complete mess that squanders its visual appeal. Mortal Engines is based on the first book in a series of five books. Peter Jackson's first mistake was handing the directing reigns to a visual effects supervisor. Mortal Engines centers on a post-apocalyptic future where mankind has turned enormous civilizations like London into mobile predator cities. They're highly impractical, but there's no denying how eye-catching they are. The biggest problem is definitely its characters. None of whom are played by recognizable actors (except Hugo Weaving). Hester Shaw is the scarred hero seeking revenge, Valentine is the villain with an obvious twist, and Tom is the reluctant tag-a-long who becomes the obvious love interest. The rest of the world is bland, unimmersive, and I was immediately turned off by an early joke about certain yellow icons. The only thing I was sort of interested in was Hester's relationship with an undead cyborg named Shrike. It sounds ridiculous, but I think they really had something there.

Novel adaptations are hard enough as it is to faithfully adapt, but when it's additionally bogged down with cliche dialogue and predictable writing, it leaves the film in a mediocre at best state.This film is unfortunately the worst kind of film as it's so standard and does not try to really do anything unique it will quickly fade into obscurity and I predict in a few days will have left my mind completely.",Mortal Engines

The fighting scenes, albeit, we're based off of Asian fighting techniques, we're slowed down that it felt like a Matrix vibe.

601,lissajoann,Easier to watch than the books were to read,10,13 April 2019,"Let me begin by saying: If you haven't read the books, you won't get this movie. At all. Just read all the ""less than 5 star reviews"" and you'll see who read them and who didn't. If you want to watch this movie, do yourself a favor and take the time to read the book series first. Also, those claiming it's ""been done"" and ""predictable"" must not realize it's based on a fairly old book series.When I heard this was being made into a movie, I immediately read the book series, as I usually do. Not gonna lie: they were a little hard to continue at times. They were very long and sometimes tedious books. The movie takes out a LOT of content, but the missing content wouldn't explain anymore to those who don't know the story, so that is neither here nor there.It actually stays pretty true to the story with only minor changes. Among the most significant changes were the deaths, as in who lives and who died. In the books neither Katherine Valentine nor Bevis Pod survive, with Katherine dying (accidentally) at the hands of her own father. They stray from the story some at this point. As devastated as I was at that in the book, I hate they left it out because it needed to happen for Tom and Hester's sake.
I hope they continue the movie franchise and don't make one and quit like ""The Giver"" or completely ruin the whole story like ""Divergent"".",Mortal Engines
602,queen-of-zeba,Liked the film but a waste of Robert Sheehan's talents,7,15 December 2018,"I absolutely loved Robert Sheehan in Misfits, which I think is one of the best and funniest TV series of all time. In Mortal Engines, they took away his wonderful Irish accent and sense of humour, and turned him into a soppy, Frodo-with-big-limpid-eyes-like character.

608,hudsonrailey,"Way better than people are saying. Amazing Visuals and Sequences, but rushed story and lines.",6,20 December 2018,"When the first trailer for Mortal Engines was released I didn't know what to think. The visuals looked stunning, but the concept of cities on wheels on film seemed like something that could be a movie of heavy action and little plot, and it sort of was, but not as much as other reviews I have seen have been saying.The movie's storyline was actually pretty good. I felt that it had good character potential and fun scenes as well as mystery and intriguing backgrounds that made you want to see more of the franchise. But while the story was good, it was extremely rushed feeling, and many of those moments that made you want to see more just were not done right, thus ruining what could have been a superb cinematic experience. I thought the actors in the film were all well cast and played the roles well, but some of the lines were just not written as good as they could have been, making some of the things delivered kind of cheesy or rushed. Also, so much was happening at once that it got confusing to keep up with. It wasn't until the third act of the movie that I really understood what was going on, and what was behind each character's motives. The fact that it took me that long to understand the motives through the scenes and dialogue does make this movie not as good as it should be.I liked Mortal Engines, and I think if other movies such as Into the Spiderverse, and Mary Poppins and Welcome to Marwen and all the other movies coming out for Christmas weren't being released it could have done better at the box office, but the film's rushed plot and hard to follow story and dialogue make what could have been an iconic, spectacular movie suffer.",Mortal Engines

the producer behind Lord of the Rings, that this would be somewhat of a
thrilling scifi fantasy movie. To me this was a mini series crammed into a movie
because the plot was moving slow then rapid then ultrarapid instead of it being told
in a good manner, good pace, understand the ""players"" and their reasoning behind their actions.Maybe the evildoer was not truly evil buit believed in his cause so much that he was willing to sacrifice everything. and the ""hero"" was someone trying to destroy his/her work.In Lord of the Rings there was meat on the storyline bones but in this it is so hectic that it looses a lot in the speed.Graphics was awesome, it had all the potential to be a great movie when it was still a trailer, or a good mini series, but alas it falls short at the end product.",Mortal Engines
613,kristianSeverens,Good movie that could have been great.,7,30 December 2018,"So here is the main problem with the movie: The backstory. The movie seems to be wanting to put too much stuff in 2 hours. This is one of the few movies that would have been better if they were longer. The backstory we get on the characters is giving us enough information about them, but it does not give us enough to feel for them and care about them. You like the characters, but you just lack a connection to them. Making this movie 30 minutes longer would have made this movie an instant 8,5/10 if they just gave the main character, and side characters connected to her past, more time on screen. The second problem is that the story lacks originality. It is a good story, but it has been told many times before, and this movie only puts it in a new coating. Now for the positive: The movie visually amazing. The CGI was great. The directing (which had a clear Peter Jackson influence in it, even though he was the producer) was also really good. The audio was good, but it could have been a bit rougher like Mad Max. I would very much recommend going to this movie, unless you only go for the story. If they make a sequel and they get an original story, that movie could very well become the best of that year.",Mortal Engines

616,Evil-Toe-Monster,Bad amalgamation of much better things...,2,30 April 2019,"First of all, this film is way too long in my opinion. The final battle scene lasts about 40 minutes, about 1 hour and 30 minutes into the movie. Most of the scenes are filler and have no reason being there. They don't show any character growth or development and are not justified being as long as they are. While the Lord of the Rings trilogy (incredible films that this one is aping) last about three hours each, every scene is placed there meaningfully, are as long as they need to be, and they serve some sort of purpose to the world, characters, or story. I found myself incredibly bored throughout Mortal Engines, despite it being an hour shorter. Second of all, this film is loaded with cliches. I won't get into any as some are spoilers to the movie, and if you watch it, just note that they are littered throughout. The action is shot atrociously as well. Instead of a film like John Wick (very good however massively different to this film) having lots of clean wide shots that look gorgeous, are well choreographed, easy to follow, and build suspense, they try to cover up bad choreography with close up shaky-cam in this movie. The reason this is a 2/10 and not a 1/10 is that I do think there are a couple of alright performances and the movie looks good visually at times. I don't recommend this unless you already really, really want to watch it.",Mortal Engines

It has even more giant amazing machines and the special effects and cinematics are top-notch. The acting is very good. The story is good. Star Wars is far more corny if you want to compare. This movie has fantastic visuals, tender moments, suspenseful moments, and a great ending. When I discovered Peter Jackson helped produce and write the screenplay for this, it became clear why it is so good.I must give this movie a 10, if for nothing else, to help offset the injustice of other reviews. If you rated Star Wars high and not this movie, then I contend that you are a hypocrite.

And a cyborg zombie, scarier than the Terminator, with a hobby of fixing broken things? What other movie can give you THAT?! But that beautiful red flyer ... WOW! What do we call it, an ornithopter? That was a work of art. Corny lines, unbelievable scenes, predictable plot, and stereotyped characters? Of course, and I enjoyed every moment of it!

621,d_fitheques,A masterpiece surfing on some unprecedented waves,10,20 December 2018,"As Weta Digital has set the stage to for so many digitally enhanced movies for years now, audiences, especially young ones, are on the brink of overseeing the IMAX might of Mortal Engines.Most of them return home ranting against clichés met. The Boy meets girl plot. The slave market. The deadly weapon. The heroic aerial fleet against the big menace. The 'I'm your father' scene. Checked, checked, checked.But review again. Those clichés are like old fellows handled there as former childs cherish ancient toys for a new little while each time they open the dusty box where they duty stay. The weird post-apocalyptic environment sets all the differences : For Tom the Cityboy and his mysterious scarred partner, WE (and sometimes our food) are the ancients. That market is NOT a slave market. Some kind of deadly nuclear weapon rays HAVE BEEN searched by our contemporaries (see Wikipedia - Project Excalibur). The heroic fleet is... slow. And Yes, Thaddeus Valentine reveals his fathership. But maybe he didn't and just cheated.That's how abysmal comes Peter Jackson's touch when nearing classical Hollywoodies in a displaced setting : at any turn you can't help but wondering about those mysts, before getting surprised and shocked by a bouquet of unexpectable tips : has anybody ever seen anything like Shrike's irreverence to a ceiling ? Computed the horrific value of Mr. Stigwood's white buttons coat ? And so many so-ons.Apart the ubergrandiose scenery and its glove score, what I may celebrate above all are the gift of those unprecedented giant 3D close-ups, either they highlight Hester Shaw's mute suffering & anger, Tom Natsworthy's talkative erudite ingenuity, Anna Fang's cool badassery, Thaddeus Valentine's warm deceptivity, or substantiate background arcs involving secondary characters intertwined in the greater run-scheme.And that Jenny Haniver aircraft chosing the wind at a conclusion feels undoubtedly inviting.

Cons: there's a interesting side plot involving the main females characters father which I think should have been elaborated on

But, from this devastation we're to believe that the only logical recovery plan for humanity was to build gigantic, track-drive cities ripping across the beautiful green terrain that has recovered wonderfully from any destruction & looks like anyone would want to live on... and some of these cities trade with each other but the main city in the story attacks, loots, invites all the people to become citizens & then consumes the other cities as fuel (?) for some reason. No idea what the little tracked cities burn.Society has been devastated but you don't splinter off to build homesteads and progress to having communities again, NO, you make city-sized bulldozers because... stuff. And the people have the technology & resources to build and expand and mobilize the cities but can't manage a house. Weak.So, the cities burn cities for fuel, as though that wouldn't be a self-defeating concept. Then you have air ships jetting around with flaming engines but that never need to carry any fuel which makes you wonder why the mobile cities don't use the same engines. And then you have *rebels* who have decided that they are going to oppose the way of the world and do the only thing that would have made sense that people would have done after the destruction of all the major cities: build homesteads and communities.",Mortal Engines

While China lost The Opium Wars, here - Asia won, with some inside help to bring down London.The movie is enjoyable since I really like steampunk, but the story is laughable.
You probably won't like it if you're not into steampunk/sci-fi.

I believe it was designed that way to increase the curiosity to the main characters but less and less details make the viewer loose interest.Thr movie develops a quite good interest in the first part, wondering about the world, how they started to move the cities, what is beyond the wall, why they live near it, rtc.

One of the worst with such capital projection.Watchmen (2009) was set to be an art movie. Commercially, Watchmen didn't meet its objective. Artistically it is an outstanding movie.On the contrary, Marvel movies aren't considered an artistic movie but commercially successful (very).Meanwhile, TDKR trilogy is one of the best action movie ever. Both artistically and commercially successful.One thing I know is; it's okay if you don't get to be both. You'd be considered successful if you 'won' in either one of those two.Sadly, Mortal Engines failed in both terms above. It simply doesn't have the formula to be a hit. Wasting tons of talents and hardworking artists.The CGI is awesome. The cast are fresh-looking, Hugo Weaving had the balancing role here amongst the young actors.What went wrong? To be, at least, commercially successful you got to make a story relatable to its environment. Why waste a good CGI with such shallow story where people can enjoy a movie without one. It's like expecting Watchmen to be like Marvel movies.Marvel wanted to make an beyond-life villain. So they made Thanos out of CGI to make an epic impression. Such thing couldn't be done without CGI.Star Wars and Guardians of The Galaxy movies are depending on CGI so much. If we remove the CGI we got a political crime and comedy movies.In Mortal Engines if we remove the CGI out of it, basically we got the same boring detective movie.

The concept was great but I think Peter Jackson has lost the ability to adapt books. Lord of the Rings worked because the kept to the story and adapted it for screen, the Hobbit didn't work because they extended it into a bloated monster for screen and Mortal Engines fails because they have changed the story so much to make a their movie version. I didn't mind it when I first saw it, it's an ok film with great ideas that it doesn't really capitalise on but then I read the book.....The nuanced villain has become almost comic book, despite Hugo Weaving's best efforts and the changes to make the Star Wars like ending took the tragedy from the finale. Hester seems hollow and her affection for Tom seems forced. Tom doesn't get to be our unwitting hero, with all his bravery that breaks down Hester removed and the tragic end is turned into an explosive pyrotechnic fest.

However, while watching it it is very hard to understand some choices the characters make, it is very easy to predict twists in the story and overall the overall plot seems very unbelievable.Curious about this I have read the book afterwards and to my mild surprise it has NONE of these problems. Every single weird choice made by a character is a modification from the book. When a plot twist is stupid and predictable in the movie, it was already know to the reader in the book. There are no deus ex machinas.To me it seems that the movie was adapted too much to suit the current political situation, e.g.: only small groups of people can be evil and the rest is just being manipulated, people can be redeemed, love your enemies etc.Most of the adaptation parts seem unnecessary. I know that it is possible to make great strides from the original material and still make a great movie (Ready Player One is a great example of this), but in this case they should have stuck to the original.I hope for a sequel nevertheless, however it will necessarily need to divert even more from the written material due to the choices they made again.",Mortal Engines

696,tatarynowicz,A rather weak fantasy movie,3,7 February 2019,"Don't let the premise and visuals fool you, this is not a sci-fi movie by any means. A magical moving evil castle with ex-Matrix grand wizard tries to conquer the world with a doomsday spell that can be destroyed by the brave hero - followed by a well-meaning golem - with the artifact her mother gave her before she died. Everything is loud and impressive-looking with realistic-looking grime. But the problem isn't that it's not sci-fi, but that it's just not a good movie.The acting I could live with, and the character design is ok, but the dialog is very predictable, the characters don't have any feelings more complex than love/hate/fear (except, maybe, for the golem which is said to have no feelings att all, but actually exhibits love, kindness, fear and sacrifice, among other things).And the internal logic of the world they inhabit is very poorly thought trough.The heroine sees the golem, which she considers something of a surrogate father, be shot at and then fall down dead, but doesn't try to take his corpse with her to maybe fix him? A flying fortress is completely destroyed by a single person making a few little fires here and there? Gigantic machines that feed themselves by eating each other? A slave market that sells people to be made into food? All that just doesn't make sense. And the amount of work that would be required in a kind-of-post-industrial society to make those colossal robot-buildings would be truly staggering, yet they're treated no better than beater cars.Only to be watched with sound off.",Mortal Engines

699,Flavianomatos,"Good visuals, but wrong in so many ways",6,12 February 2019,"This movie's plot is wrong in so many ways that I know well where to begin: in the beginning.Soon after London captures that city, a high authority goes there to welcome the captured city's citizens, without any protection, as if no one expected people whose homes were destructed had a strong grunge against the people who destroyed them. And then, while Hester goes on to stab Valentine, nobody takes notice of Tom yelling danger. Also, nobody attempts to stop Hester, after she stabbed a man. And this man, having being stabbed, goes on pursuit of the stabber, instead of seeking medical care. When Tom tells Valentine that Hester accuses him of killing her mother, he pushes him to that waste chute, instead of just dismissing such an accusation.One must conclude that absorbing another city is something that does not happen frequently, as it is shown only once in the movie. Also, integrating the populations of too many devoured cities would eventually lead to overpopulation.Valentine goes to some sort of prison where a zombie/cyborg called Strike is held. He is allowed to talk to the prisoner, but to release him, he has to shoot missiles and destroy the prison, for some unspecified reason.No explanation is given about how news travel in this world, but Anna Fang is able to locate Hester just as she is being auctioned. Thankfully, Fang is able to fight the many men in the scene while not being shot, which is not unreasonable, just a cliché.When Hester boards Fang's aircraft, Fang intends to leave Tom behind, but for some reason leaves the door open till he boards. In the craft, Hester tells her story with Strike, and how he abandoned him on knowing (by some unspecified means) that London was in the continent. Tom says he wanted to be a pilot, without telling anything about taking flight lessons or something to that effect, yet Fang lets him land it in Airhaven.There, in Airhaven, when Strike is about to crush Tom, he decides not to, suspecting that Hester loves him, but after that, he seems to be dead, perhaps from the wounds he had received, wounds that seemed to have no effect on him till then.After two blasts, MEDUSA becomes unstable, which would explain its exploding in the end. What does not make sense is that the self-destruction protocols would work, unless they where built in this new MEDUSA, which is dumb, because some components must have being put in place for an intended breakdown.There may be more things that make little sense in the plot but this review deals only with the ones that make the movie less enjoyable.

704,speedforce131,Hit 'em high and hit 'em low,6,16 June 2019,"Mortal Engines takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity has near destroyed itself and the planet. The remnants of civilization reside on gigantic motor vehicles that also serve as their home cities. It is a dog eat dog world where cities consume each other and add their people and technology to their own.We are introduced to Tom Natsworthy (who is portrayed by Robert Sheehan), an apprentice historian for the city of London and Katherine Valentine (Leila George) the daughter of the mayor of London Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving). During the absorption of people from a captured city, a woman named Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) attempts to assassinate Thaddeus Valentine. From this event, the film escalates in intensity.It is odd that the film introduces us to a variety of characters but quickly severs us from those characters. Some characters are not seen again, or their relevance has been lessened severely. In other cases, characters are introduced all of a sudden and are given significance, if only to drive the plot forward.The best aspect to this film is definitely the visuals. The use of colors is very prominent here with the world and it's characters being very vibrant and rich. Each scene, whether it is during the daytime, or night, whether on or off it's cities, looks beautiful. The camera angles, lighting and color, in addition to the special effects, all combine into a very good looking movie.The action sequences are also exciting to watch although it's not something that you haven't seen before. There's sequences that range from hand-to-hand combat, to aerial dogfights, and city to city vehicular combat. They have a grand, magnificent splendor to them that is a sight to behold.Acting, however, is a bit left to be desired. The characters are one-dimensional, comical, and sometimes are overblown. The dialogue doesn't make it any better as many lines seem cheesy.Despite the inconsistent plot and cheesy dialogue, Mortal Engines is an enjoyable movie. Don't come into the movie expecting a masterpiece. If you come into it looking for big budget spectacle with set pieces and action with an attractive cast, that's exactly what you'll get. Sometimes, that's what you need on a boring weekend.",Mortal Engines

Fast paced, thrilling, and gripping. A lot of the action scenes are similar in terms of thrills, which is great. Every setting and every machine look amazing.
Shrike is also another fantastic element of the film. A character who somehow manages to be both endearing and unnerving with an interesting (if a little short) and emotional arc to boot. Unfortunately, that about wraps up all that is great about this film.The plot is coherent and easy to follow, but perhaps a bit too easy. As the film goes on you can already begin to guess what ""shocking"" moment is about to come next. With the exception of Shrike, hardly any of the characters are developed beyond their stereotypes. Tough girl who can take care of herself. The boy with a heart of gold. The evil old man. The mangy scavengers. Some characters are introduced in the opening act and presented as if they hold some importance to the plot, but eventually they disappear without a trace.

Every single line in this movie I've heard in another action movie and even when it takes what few original concepts the book had it makes them worse and fantastically average. Not much can be said to give you the idea that I'm trying to get across but I can just let the movie speak for itself in this assortment of ""creative"" and ""never-before-seen"" lines of which I am, of course, paraphrasing:""When will I know the signal?""
""Trust me; you'll know.""""My mother died when I was 8."" (Keep in mind said from the words of a cold, focused protagonist after before hand refusing to speak about it)""I am -insert protagonist name- and you killed my mother, -insert mother's name- You will pay for what you did to her.""""I wanted to be a -insert dream profession- but when my parents died I just did what they did.""""No!

718,catwantsin,"So essentially, the big baddie here is the city of London on freakin wheels, with lions coming out of it.",8,26 December 2018,"MORTAL ENGINES (2018)In this one the world has basically been ravaged by nuclear war. In order to survive some built cities on wheels, which ravage the land consuming other smaller cities for power and fuel. Mostly fuel unless you are a crazed lunatic like Thaddeus Valentine (played by Hugo Weaving) who basically just wants power. So essentially, the big baddie here is the city of London on freakin wheels, with lions coming out of it. It's probably the coolest steampunk dream anyone has ever had. We end up finding out that Hester Shaw (played by Hera Hilmar) is after Thaddeus because of something he did in his past. No, I am not going to give it away. If you read the book you might know, but this isn't the book, it's the movie that has the same name as the book.Anyway - from the moment this thing starts we are thrown into an exceeding well developed and thought out steam punk world of flying machines, machines under the ground, and like I said before cities on wheels. In the midst of all this is some actual brilliant story telling which reminded me a lot of ROGUE ONE. Just enough to make you care, but not puffed up or overloaded in any way. Hester's backstory is the stuff of legends and is probably residing in the pages of macabre history books gathering dust in old libraries in Europe somewhere. There is enough in this movie to encompass 3 or 4 lessor efforts, but instead we get a powerhouse not quite like anything we have ever seen. It's kind of like if the set of the 2nd HELLBOY and STARDUST had a post-apocalyptic baby.
Overall MORTAL ENGINES is inspired, stunning and brilliant, but sadly looks like that won't be recognized at the moment given the box office numbers. Scrap this up to being reduced an enthralling well- constructed cult classic in 20 years. Actually - overall maybe that's not half bad. The acting and cinematography is done on a grand scale giving this movie more punch than most of what's come out this year. MORTAL ENGINES gets a solid 7 out of 7 and is already on the BLU-RAY must have list.",Mortal Engines
719,mattyt_tmf,Pretty good honestly,8,23 October 2019,"I've wanted to watch this movie for a while once I saw that Peter Jackson was attached to the project and at long last, I've seen it. A lot of the reviews here are essentially spot on with the negatives they witnessed, but I don't think they have fully discussed the positives, which are as follows:1. MOVING CITIES?! Now that's cool! I haven't read the novels so I didn't have anything to base it on but the way they adapted the books to film was extraordinary. From what I could see, they visualised the moving cities or 'traction cities' quite well, and the grand size of the cities next to scavenger cities showed the reasonable fear that humans experienced when coming up against the traction cities.2. Cast. The cast of the film were really strong; Hugo Weaving, Hera Hilmar, Robert Sheehan... I actually really liked Jihae as Anna Fang though. I'd never seen Jihae in anything before and I was amazed at how her character, Anna, captured my attention and interest.3. Visuals. The visuals in this movie were spectacular! Reminiscent of Peter Jackson's the Lord of the Rings, this movie shows the vast space that a traction city requires and gives us the viewpoint of a tiny human looking up at it. Incredible photography.Now for the bad aspects:1. Story. For someone who hasn't read the books, this is notoriously difficult to follow along with. There's a brief voice-over at the start that explains some of the history, but it doesn't provide much information. Part of this is because of the 2 hour runtime... Perhaps it could have been better represented in a TV series?2. Weapons. It's very strange that for the first three-quarters of the movie, the traction cities use nothing but grappling hooks to reel in smaller cities to conquer. Yet towards the end, they seem to have cannons that they use to fire at the Northern Air Fleet. Very strange that they only suddenly decide to use them.3. Characters. Some of the characters just pop out of nowhere and don't appear again for about an hour, yet seem to be relevant to the plot. There's considerable time spent introducing them and then they're never seen again. Very strange.Overall, this was a really great film and I feel like its critics have been overtly harsh. Its box office was unfortunate but I think this movie was a solid 8/10. Thanks for reading :)",Mortal Engines

Because the whole story, plotline, characterization, basic concepts, love interest, action, bad guy - the whole shebang - is so clearly directed at ""young adults"" that anyone of my ancient age trying to judge it on the basis of those elements is going to be asking too much of it. But kids, and anyone who likes dystopian science fantasy action films will do too. And there's a good amount of humor in it too.This was a hugely enjoyable piece of nonsense.

Obviously bad, bad guy, check. Great CGI, check. Did I mention the pretty much non-stop action?The characters are pretty two dimensional, but sympathetic enough.

However, there are just far too many flaws with the movie and you end up with a whole bunch of questions that are left unanswered.What events caused the world to be destroyed in 60 seconds?Where are these other 'predatory western cities' or is London the only one?If London barely had enough resources to go a few more days, how did it manage to travel all that distance to the shield-wall of Shan Guo and use all that firepower, including 3 Medusa strikes?Why did the Shan Guoese over the wall order a pre-emptive strike which would potentially kill thousands upon thousands of innocent people based solely on a then 8/9 year-old's word that she had seen a symbol which may or may not have been a computer for the Medusa weapon? They had zero evidence of Medusa as the two characters who had actually seen it, Katherine and Bevis, were not with them and had no way of reporting it.Why did the alliance use guns in Airhaven when all the signs told them not to and they knew what would happen?Why did the Shan Guo allow Londeners into their land at the end when the Londoners had been cheering for the destruction of the wall and invasion of their country not 5 minutes prior?Why did Katherine trust Bevis when he told her about her father, rather than trust her father? Why did Bevis trust her enough to talk to her and for her not to have him arrested?Was this all really some sublayer to push a political narrative about brutal western occupations of countries with their barbarism and stupidity vs. eastern hospitality and peace? I hope not.Where did Anna get her kickass fighting skills and why did nobody else have any?Why was Shrike trying to kill Hester, his adopted daughter?If London had such wicked tech, why wasn't the equivalent available to defend Shan Guo?How did Anna and co. know about Hester's mother?What happened to the people of that first town that London ingested, did they all just go about their new lives normally after having been attacked and having their homes destroyed?Where did Hester learn to fire a gun with such accuracy that she could shoot off Tom's handcuffs?Finally, the whole thing is just completely contrived. The black guy dies, the Asian girl is a deadly kung-fu assassin, the boy falls in love with the girl blah blah blah. Tom and Hester had hardly done anything together then suddenly she's in love?

I'm not quite sure what all the hate is about, I guess it's because it's not an MCU movie lol.My one criticism is that the story is a bit predictable but the environment created by the writers is refreshing and new. Much needed in today's cinematic norms.This is a post-post-apocalyptic world, the end has already happened and now we are seeing the rebuilding of civilization and the issues/conflicts it poses. The world the writers and CG artists have created is stunning and completely out of this world. The story is interesting and keeps the momentum moving forward at all times during the movie. And there are tons of fully developed characters to latch on to.I, for one, will be looking forward to more movies of this genre. A wild ride with hints of steam-punk, a bit of Star Wars and a dash of Oh-Hell-Yeah!",Mortal Engines

There were a couple things I wish they would have changed to keep it closer to the book.
The main characters should have been cast a bit younger. It is an adaption of a young adult book, if they were younger, forgiving them for their stupid mistakes would be a lot easier. Hester Shaw's scar is supposed to be hideous. She's described as having one eye, half a nose, and a giant hairlip as this massive scar nearly cut her face in half. This scar and her insecurities because of it define so much of her character. What we got was a very attractive woman with a scar that just makes her a little badass. Tom should find that he loves her despite her looks.
There were so many other differences, but I forgave most of those because telling the story visually in the time constraint, they actually did a very good job. The ending change made it more epic than the book, so I congratulate them there.",Mortal Engines

I mean ofcourse the main protagonist just happens to recieve a lost pendent that JUST HAPPENS TO CONTAIN THE ONE THING TO STOP THE BAD THING FROM HAPPENING. Sorry but they completely lost me there.

We don't get much background into this world other than it's 1000 years into the future after at least one city was destroyed by a nasty purple light weapon. Apparently one can just make up what survives 1000 years and how people live without context of the reality they are in. I don't know if this is a spoiler but there is a wall that we have no idea why it is there, what it is protecting or why London on wheels want it destroyed. For all we know they could have knocked and asked nicely to come inside. I feel this movie was over shadowed by attempting to portray visual content at the expense of a good story.",Mortal Engines
758,jacqueline-clarke,"A world if The Hunger Games existed, everyone would volunteer as tribute",3,2 February 2019,"The selling point of this movie in every preview was PRODUCED BY PETER JACKSON!!!!! Should have known we were in trouble right there. Not the Peter Jackson part, just how much they pushed it. But I guess knowing you spent $100m on a hella lot of very obvious green screen, you do what you got to.Based on books, I can see why they thought this would be a good idea. It's such a grand idea of a world, that it would work in a book where time and explanation and your own visualization helps it along. Watching a huge structure with St. Paul's Cathedral bolted to the top cruise along eating other towns on top of a CAT excavator just gave me WTF face for almost two hours.The characters were boring, even though I thought the actors did their very best with what they were given. Everyone. Was. Trying. Their. Best. Personally, I didn't feel for anyone, cared if anyone died, etc. Everyone was loosely tied together with super obvious connections. Not that everything has to be shocking or a surprise, but lose the convenience for everyone. But then again ... who has the time?Since it comes in under two hours (thankfully), they had a lot of meat to serve. They need to hate each other! They need to tell their sad stories! They need to meet others and have possible interactions! They need to fall in love! Crap! We need to show more towns! Crap! We need an actual huge fight!For a very expensive 2018 movie that people knew going in that there was a lot of physical world creation, I had really hoped for much better effects. And I am not an effects junkie, I can let things go. I can forgive a lot of things. But don't promise me bold and deliver me eh, we gave it a shot.The ending was definitely not the planned ending. With four books, I would lay a bet with my bookie that there was a grand scheme of this being the next Hunger Games. Until they realized that young adult dystopia is not so much on trend anymore, steampunk is a very specific taste, and the entire concept was more than any movie could handle. I applaud though giving it a feeling of finalityl with the wait... just maybe? Hey guys, maybe we can have more money for a sequel? No? That's alright, I'll let you think it over. Just in case though, we'll get a good hug in.Three stars for the pure size of balls to even attempt to pull this off... minus seven for it being ridiculous.",Mortal Engines

The movie is a beautiful adaptation of the first book, a wonderful one. Despite the twist ending, I really loved the movie and I will go to see it again and again, and will get the blu-ray when is out. So, the CGI is outstanding, the effects are amazing, the story sticks at its 90% to the book, of course I see the film has been cut to fit into those two hours. No way around that I guess, hopefully there will be a director's ext edition on disc later on.I loved Hester Shaw, she was awesome and she rocked! I wish there would be more bad-ass scenes with her. Tom was funny, and naively brave as in the books. Both were nicely portrayed. I wish there would be more and more screen time for them though.As for Mr. Shrike, Shrike was wonderfully played by Stephen Lang. An aspect of Shrike's CGI that I did NOT like is that in my mind and thanks to PR's drawings of him, Shrike was supposed to have more of those dreadlocks visible to the sides and going to some parts of the chest I guess. I don't know, but it looked too thin for me, too simple. A Stalker is a deadly machine, hence it should have shown the claws in the movie :P but I guess it is PG13 film isn't?Anna was awesome as well, nicely played. Dr Twix was superb :D exactly how I imagined her.As for the outstanding Hugo Weaving's acting, that was impressive. He is so good as a villain. Perfectly portrayed Valentine.Very good post-apoc film based on Phillip Reeve's first novel of the same name.GO SEE IT! I recommend it.",Mortal Engines

Perhaps its innoscence causes detached cynicism and an intellectualism seeking for something that isn't there, in some; so that engagement with what it is, is not possible. The visual symphony and soundtrack are smooth and seamless, its romantic, dark without dirge and heaviness, with genuine pathos, a constant vitality from actors without overacting, and it seems to be a study of the constant struggle between the wider good, what ever that should be, and personal ambition, all, perhaps requiring gentle innoscent acceptance for enjoyment and enjoinment.",Mortal Engines

For the plot,as in my title,it was confusing and really stiff.the part where the robot died,it was obvious the scene was only there to stir emotions,it was damningly unnatural.
The character development is kinda cringey too,the love line between the main characters...it just seemed so stiff and sudden.

775,fgagnerot,the cheap thrill of a blockbuster movie,3,11 March 2019,"Did not read the books, but left the movie in the pretty clear feeling that the movie did not do them justice.In the good point (no plural): the movie is visually beautiful and that is it.Everything else is an issue. The depicted universe lacks consistency and realism, after 1h30, I was still wondering why are the cities moving and the doctrine of ""municipal darwinism"" did not make that clear. Now it could either mean I am very unattentive either that it is simply not explained enough. Same thing with the social organisation of the cities, in tiers, it's addressed very briefly but serves no purpose in the plot and thus does not contribute to the thickness of this world. We cannot feel for those characters who live in a universe that, as a spectator, I could not project myself in. Yes this is Sci-Fi, but still there is nothing to make it real for us. This is supposed to be a post-apocalypse universe, I did not feel any of that vibe, just CGI with moving cities and big engines.The characters themselves are as flat as can be and every interaction between them are found, in my opinion, useless and uninteresting. I could not care less about them, their pseudo-sad past and their pseudo-romance which starts out of the blue and serves no purpose yet again. Everything lacks consistence, and as a results, looks at best cheap, at worst completely cliché, like Anna Fang, who looks like a cheap Trinity-inspired rebel with her hair perfectly done and full make-up on (it's the end of the world but apparently not for her!) or the city of Shan Guo and its leader who looks like a Chinese Kung-fu master from the classic HK movies. The revengeful robot plot is also a classic example of that problem: brought in and out with no context, too little coverage, its death leaves you in perfect indifference, while accordingly some good material was there to build an emotion of the fallen robot playing as substitute dad and caring for the girl. Same thing again for the ""plot twist"" at the end of Hester being the daughter of Valentine....We had a good laugh watching that movie and commenting on every funny aspects but seriously though, do not expect anything here except nice CGI.",Mortal Engines

This film is certainly more than meets the eye at first glance, and is deeper than the trailer would lead one to believe. I very rarely write reviews, but this deserves one.Yes, there are fantastic action sequences; yes, the CGI is wonderful. Despite some familiar tropes, the film keeps one's attention. But beyond this, it's a story about the dangers of pride, corruption, and mindless exploitation and consumerism. It is a refreshing critique of imperialism and the notion of Western superiority.With a well-chosen cast, the film encourages questioning the status quo, and depicts its vital importance. It is a resounding illustration of the virtues of compassion, unity, life, and yes - love. Love of friends, of family, of culture, and of peace.I highly encourage anyone who is on the fence about watching Mortal Engines to take the time to see it, even if only for the enthralling action.

It's the first movie I've watched that is being set in a sci-fi/steampunk location.
The VFX/CGI looked stunning at all times, the really put some effort in there.
The score by JunkieXL was really well done and fitted perfectly with the setting.
Acting was quite decent, though I think that Hugo Weaving and Stephen Lang had the best performances.
The production design was very well done and there is tons of great action scenes. Besides the CGI, the actual design and look of London and other steampunk machinery was really great.
Now here are the cons.
The pacing is way too fast. I understand it's hard to fit all details from a book story into a movie, but it felt like the director and writers were stuffing as many things as possible into a 2 hour duration.
2 hours is just too short for this kind of movie. Wish they would've at least released an extended blu ray version or something.The story was very predictable and there were quite some cliché moments.
There were also some things that didn't really make sense to me:
The story is set more than 1000 years after our current time, and altough the machinery seems to be better. Other technology does not. There are some references to 21st century tech being referred to as ""old tech"" with 21st century humans being called ""the ancients"". There were some shots were you could see some of that ""old tech"" being shown in a museum like iPhones. But something I do not understand is why are they using round or oval shaped CRT screens in the 32nd century? Why is everything back to analog instead of digital? Sure it's a steampunk and that is how steampunk is supposed to look, but the movie is sci-fi at the same time.There is also very little to none character development. Other than the 3 main characters, there is very little we know about all other side characters which makes them very forgettable.On a scale of 1 to 10 i'd give it a solid 7.0 because I thought the movie was really enjoyable and kept me interested enough for the entire 2 hours. I hope there will be a sequel to this, though I highly doubt we will get it anytime soon due to the movie being a box office flop.

The painstaking effort of realizing this world on the silver screen, is successfully achieved by Peter Jackson and Christian River. We dive right into the action and only take small breaks for exposition. Most of the story is told on the fly and there is a lot to absorb. If one hasn't read the books, repeat viewings will help fill in back story. I was so pleased with all aspects of casting. Jihae and Hera Hilmar shine as two kickass women. Hugo Weaving was deliciously evil. And what the hell is with Shrike? Purely terrifying. The movie clocks in at a comfortable 2hr 10mins and leaves things open for a sequel, or plenty more.

The characters were all 1 sided and odious to watch not that they even let you get to know them. The train wreck of the ending was distorted from a tale of tragedy a Star Wars style family reunions to a big explosion that physically doesn't make sense because no one got injured by a NUKE and everyone getting a smiling ending holding hands singing kumbaya.You thought it was in good hands with Peter Jackson but if he had actually read the 4 book sequel you wouldn't have known. The books made sense and the characters had depth of mind rather than just hate, love, power and so called duty bound reasons to do things. When London explodes in the book it is not because of one big push of four teenagers but a war of historians and stalkers and changed minds and why was Catherine just allowed to pull the breaks and save the city like that.

Therefore its only diverting for a short while.And why did they change the ending so much? Although the outcome seems to be pretty much the same I do not see any reason to create a new and somewhat more predictable finish.

Here I describe some of the main character for you: Hester - her mother's cohabitant try to steal deluxe box with premium size unique weapon. She is the only owner of the working battery of that thing. The key plot's moment of this film is battle for the terrific weapon. Also in this film we have amazing Anna Fang from the East after long term physical training. She is a pilot of pink cabriolet-plane . Another great hero (for me he was the greatest) is metal showman in the twilight of his shinning career with paranoid syndrome. The villain is old copy of Keanu Reeves after 10 unsuccessful plastic surgical operations of the face and trouble character. The band of gondoliers. Among them are Geralt of Rovia and his Arabic ""friend"". Also the key but unimportant character of this epic show is Tom. He's forever alone, none understands him. He doesn't know why everyone wants that magic weapon so much, but he is helping them anyway hoping to find a friend. his dream is to became a pilot.

The movie felt rushed and some characters, such as Anna Fang, were very cheesy. She's edgy, always wears sunglasses and there's a scene where she takes out an armed group of people with some kind of shotgun.As others have said and my boyfriend who saw the movie with me agreed, Shrike was one of the best characters in the movie in terms of his story and design and a redeeming factor.

868,charliegrindrod,Out of Fuel,2,21 April 2020,"Mortal Engines is a bad adaptation of an otherwise imaginative book by Philip Reeve. Hester Shaw goes from a strong female lead that isn't made for looks but rather character, to a straight up Mary Sue that Hollywood toned down massively. Her scar isn't horrible, as it just looks like a light cut on her face. It's barely faithful to how it's described in the book. Tom's character looks more 21 than 15, and he's just annoying rather than a bit of a sweetheart with a knack for adventure. There's no Guild Marks to be found, Valentine is a generic villain, and there's no real reason for London to have a super-weapon seeing how large and powerful it already is. Shrike is actually decent, but for some reason he gets killed, despite the fact that Shrike IS ALIVE IN ALL OF THE BOOKS. The final act is a direct ripoff of Star Wars, where there's rebel fighters laying siege against a powerful enemies' super-weapon, and a moment where the antagonist reveals something to the one of the protagonists: they are their father. The visual effects and designs of the cities are actually very impressive and the score by Junkie XL is actually really cinematic. Some of the acting is okay, but Hugo Weaving and Stephen Lang definitely stand out.Overall, it has faithfulness to the book but not enough to justify its existence which makes it a cliché sci-fi fantasy story that isn't much of a recommendation to a large demographic. Just stick to the book.",Mortal Engines

However, my expectations to this movie was unexpectedly high, thanks to the trailer. And it did fulfill my expectations.

874,ryanquirk,Potential squandered,6,12 August 2019,"Mortal Engines was a trilogy crammed into a single, flawed movie. I enjoyed the scope, the ideas and the characters but it all needed to be fleshed out more. The Resurrected Man for example? What a great character, but wasted, an intriguing old soul in a new world, designed to kill but with the necessary compassion and intellect to raise an eight year old girl? That is a movie in and of itself surely.I suppose there is always a risk of a movie or trilogy dragging on, of too much world building and not enough action, but Mortal Engines is the opposite. It needs to be epic and the world, the story and the people in it need time to grow. I suppose the studio's strategy can be called into question too. They went all in on one big movie with the only household name in it being Hugo Weaving. He's great and everything, but the other actors were just as compelling, or and their characters would have been too, if they'd been allowed to be.If it had been my movie I'd have pushed for a grittier smaller budget, but more human Mortal Engines 1 and then; once the foundation had been laid, the world built and the characters , gone for the big budget epic 2nd and 3rd instalments.",Mortal Engines

883,ridwaneaissaoui,"Beautiful, but seriously flawed",7,13 December 2018,"This movie is gorgeous. Everything from the ships to the different colonies and cities looks amazing, exactly as you pictured it if you read the book. They nailed it perfectly. Unfortunately they didn't put that amount of effort in the story and characters. The story feels boring and predictable. And that is a bit weird because the book seemed relatively easy to adapt from a story wise perspective, and it had a very unpredictable story.
Concerning the plot, there are smaller arcs that would have benefited to be removed from the movie (why do they even mention the engineers here? They are important in the book but not at all in the movie). The issue is that the main plot points are badly affected by those smaller arcs. It shrinks the time they have to develop correctly the main story. And that causes my biggest problem with the movie : everything seems rushed. You don't have the time to grow any attachement to the characters (except Shrike who has a complete and compelling narrative arc). The movie never slows down which is a huge flaw in this post-apocalyptic world. And it would have benefited from more exposition regarding this podt-apocalyptic world : the concepts of predator cities, tractionnists, anti-tractionnists... I think it's confused and blurry if you have no knowledge about this world going into the movie. Also I know it's an adaptation and by definition they have to change some plot point from the book, but did they really need to completely change the third act in order to have a full happy ending ? I won't spoil the book for those who didn't read it but the ending is really different with some heartbreaking moments and you end up with an overall bleak and bitter feeling that matches the world described.
In the end the movie is still good, it's entertaining and it looks amazing (I really recommend you see it on imax). The world presented is fascinating even if they could have introduced it better. You will like it if you can get past the predictable story and simply enjoy it for what it is.",Mortal Engines

891,bwebbblog,Mad Max if George Miller had been lobotomised before directing it,2,13 December 2018,"I had a few drinks before going to see this film, fully ready to embrace some goofy post apocalyptic insanity for 2hrs of my evening. This film still somehow managed to become frustrating.As someone who hasn't read the books, a lot of things happened or that were brought up with zero prior reference or explanation, not always necessary to explain everything that happens in a film, but this felt like ""No Context: The Movie"".The people I was with were equally confused at plot points that seemed to be crowbarred in, as well as the eye rolling love dynamics between characters that were so under developed you neither saw these things coming, or cared. Many laughs were had during serious scenes as a result. Most of the characters were so 2D you could not empathise with them at all, weirdly I found myself sympathising with Hugo Weaving's character most of all, as he seemed to be the only one who was well acted with concrete motivations. I couldn't have cared less about the two mains throughout the whole film, poorly acted and barely had any character development between them.The spectacle itself was not worth the admission price either. Some nice set and costume design, but the world itself felt very flat and was nothing you haven't seen before in a film like Mad Max (where it was executed better). The CGI goes into overdrive and grows boring fast, the cinematography not allowing to even properly admire the post apocalypse landscapes or settings in their full glory. The sense of dread when certain things are unearthed can't be felt at all, because the film has zero atmosphere and the plot skips along so quickly there are set ups and payoffs with no effort to build tension; the director couldn't seem to bare the thought of a camera shot that lasted longer than 3 seconds and it reflects in the script too.All I can say is if you've enjoyed previous big budget post apocalyptic films, give this one a miss. Awful script, and not enough spectacle to compensate for that.",Mortal Engines

I didn't find it totally predictable..It's action packed from beginning to end..I found a couple of bits a little cheesy and the acting in parts wasn't amazing.. but overall I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would def recommend it.. prob a better watch at the cinema because of the visuals which are always nicer on a big screen.,Mortal Engines

898,moisupremo,Beautiful... but poor,7,11 March 2019,"What can I say, I really want this movie to be good but the story is just messed up. The cinematography is stunning and the CGI is perfect, they both creates a beautiful world, apocalyptic but beautiful.
The acting is amazing, especially from Hugo Weaving. I believe the director of photography made a wonderful job. The colors are beautiful and they transmit. The action and the suspense are very good and you really want to know what is going to happen next, but here comes the problem, you kind of already know what is going to happen because the movie is so god damn predictable and cliche.Some examples are: When Valentine says to Hester that they are not so different and that they both do whatever they have to do to accomplish what they want. (This can't be more cliche, this same dialogue is literally in every movie where theres a bad guy and a good guy)Theres also a predictable scene when Jihae (Anna Fang) tells Hester and Tom why they called her ""Wind Flower"". She basically says that she wants that when she dies his ashes are scattered by the wind. So you instantly know that she is going to die, because why would she tell that directly to the camera if she wasn't. And she did.The only thing that really surprised me was that ending. They hugged? After all they've come through and they hug? That just caught me off guard. It's also cliche but I think that kiss was necessary.But Well... despite that little predictable story, the movie is good and very well made. The predictability was not a factor to stop watching the movie, it was still thrilling to me to watch and that's why I gave it a 7 since the only flaw was the script.",Mortal Engines
899,Conundrum5,The CGI is all this movie has.,4,4 January 2019,"Mortal Engines has some pretty cool depictions of massive cities that move around a post-apocalyptic Earth. Thing is, everything else is pretty poor.The characters are one-note, for the most part. These are the 4 most main characters: We've got the edgy teen girl with a sad backstory and wears a scarf over her face for pretty much only 20 minutes, despite the fact she always wants to hide her scar. Then there's the hot British boy who's meant to be 18, 19, or something but looks 25 (the actor was around 30 years old when they filmed the movie), who's only development is that he wanted to be a pilot and in the end of the movie is a pilot. The ninja rogue character is introduced in a scene with a such a drastically different, more violent tone that their character seems off for the rest of the movie. Finally, there's Hugo Weaving's character who is so obviously and annoyingly evil that you cannot take them seriously at all, and is made all the worse when they pull the most overused, unimpressive and desperate twists I might have ever seen. (He's the edgy teen's dad, just like it was done in Star Wars years ago in The Empire Strikes Back.)Speaking of story events, these unoriginal cliches are peppered all throughout the movie. The resistance, the giant death beam that will end the world, the last haven on Earth (that happens twice for some reason), the unstoppable monster, love winning over, etc.Those last three culminated into probably the worst part of the movie, which was the sky city that protects the resistance. The sets seemed completely fake due to some bad editing that doesn't show the inside of the city as a whole and just the cramped tunnels, and the entire thing was destroyed within 5-10 minutes due to the big bad robot that mumbles ""hEsTeR sHaW"" every 10 seconds, where that thing was then defeated by the power of love. Everything bad about this movie was emphasised in this scene, seemingly to add something from the book and take out the aforementioned robot from the story so it can focus on Hugo Weaving's total world domination plans.I haven't read the books, but from what I've heard of from people who have read them, they pretty much butchered it and slapped together different parts of the overarching story, probably to make a standard three-act story for a Hollywood Blockbuster roughly based on some events and places from the books. So even if you're a fan of the books, this movie may not be for you anyway due to the heavily shortened butchered story, meaning this movie's only really for people who want to see massive cities chasing each other. And even then, that happens in the first 5 minutes and never again in the rest of the movie (This is probably where most of the budget went). Meaning, I don't really know who this movie's for.Overall, there's nothing really to this. It's a collection of overused cliches, incompatible tones, stupidly simple characters and some CGI that's sorta cool to look at. I guess the sound effects, like the Medusa Cannon were kinda satisfying, and there were some hilarious line deliveries where I had to stop myself from laughing really hard in the theatre.It's just... ehh. Maybe a good movie to laugh at with friends.",Mortal Engines

Its from that guy who made those Lord of the Rings movies about hobbits and dwarves and wizards and Agent Smith as an elf king(?).This film started out promising, then became a mess. The first opening sequence, visually, got me hooked. Rolling predator cities that eat smaller rolling cities! Great concept, wanted to see more of it. Then they never showed it again!We meet Not-Elle Fanning as a red scarfed rebel who wants to kill Agent Smith who is the captain(?) of London (which is now I guess one of the largest predator cities rolling around Europe). She gets on board, and because Agent Smith killed her mother, she wants revenge so she stabs him. This was her whole ambition. And she achieved it in the first 15 minutes of the movie! This should have been at the end! The filmmakers should have been building up to this; this scene should have been the big climatic scene at the end, when not-elle fanning finally confronts her mother's killer. Nope, they do it right at the start of the film.So she stabs him, but not fatally, though, and then she gets dumped outside the rolling city with a milquetoast historian played by not-eddie redmayne who does nothing the entire film. And then London rolls away. Where is it going? Why did it not stop and look for not-elle fanning? If someone came onto my rolling city and then tried to assassinate my captain(?) who everyone loved, I'd want to stop and find this assassin and bring them to justice. But no. London just rolls away somewhere.Then things start happening because.. movie? Not-elle fanning and not-eddie redmayne are just about sold as slaves but then a female ninja fugitive recognizes them and saves them for some reason but then we find out this green eyed zombie character is actually pursuing not-elle fanning because she ran away from him at some point in the past. This was happening like 40 minutes into the film; this should have been introduced earlier. Not-elle fanning should have been pursuing Agent Smith and London through the story with Zombie Man on her heels to keep her moving forward. This would have created tension: our hero has to fulfill her goal before Zombie Man catches up to her and turns her into Zombie Not-Elle Fanning. But they didn't do that.During all this we find out that Agent Smith is looking for ""ancient technology"" from the 21st century, because this was a YA novel before and all YA novels take place in an apocalyptic future.. wait, was this a YA novel? I don't know. So we find out he's trying to build the Death Star lazer weapon with all this ancient technology and mount it out the dome of their library. And the whole purpose was to blow up this wall at the end of the film and not-elle fanning has to stop him.. even though no one references this wall anywhere in the first 2 acts of the film.I know, right?Oh, and there's 2 characters who could've been dumped from the film without any real consequence: Agent Smith's daughter and her maintenance guy friend who spend a majority of the film debating whether Agent Smith is a bad person. So narratively this was a mess.What They Should Have Done:Start the movie with the same opening sequence minus not-elle fanning, it was great; after London devours that little city, not-elle fanning wakes from that nightmare. We can tell its a memory of hers. She decides to strike it out and find London and kill Capt. Agent Smith. Not-eddie redmayne is still there trying to hide important ancient technology from Agent Smith as the story goes along. After she leaves the wall, Zombie Man, whose been planning to abduct not-elle fanning and turn her into a zombie or something, sets out after her; she catches wind of this somehow and now she has a hellhound on her heels as she pursues London and Agent Smith. There are a couple of close calls where Zombie Man just about captures her but not-elle fanning escapes by the thread of the red scarf she wears over her face. Along the way, she recognizes the female ninja fugitive and persuades her to help her. As they get closer to finding London, they learn of the secret Death Star lazer weapon and the plans to use it to blow up The Wall (somehow).So now, its a race to get back to the wall; not only does not-elle fanning have to beat Agent Smith there, she also has to avoid Zombie Man and still stay ahead of him.As they near London, the rolling predator city is also nearing the wall now. Not-elle fanning gets female ninja fugitive to draw Zombie Man away (he takes the bait too) so that she can get aboard the rolling city and find Agent Smith. Zombie Man then discovers the ruse he's been chasing and quickly turns his attention to getting aboard London to track down his prey. Not-elle fanning finally confronts Agent Smith, their final battle is interrupted by Zombie Man, but she is able to strike the death blow to her enemy. Zombie Man relents, seeing how shes either a great warrior or capable of doing the right thing or something, and spares her life. She is also able to stop the lazer from blowing up the wall. Then she assumes the role of captain in place of Agent Smith, and with Zombie Man, rolls away in London in search of peace.I'm not a professional screenwriter, I've never sold one script, but I think that would have made a more coherent story. Peter Jackson, if you would like to hire me in the future to script doctor or write a screenplay for you, please reach out.

Gave it two stars for the scraps of interesting ideas it gives you, and some visuals. That's it. It's all about a woman seeking revenge and having a lot of people killed because of her, as she could have prevented the destruction of the whole floating place just by speaking to the poor Shrike that only wanted her happiness. Same woman tries to get revenge for her mom's death by killing the guy who murdered her, a smart and incredibly dangerous man, but when close enough to kill him, she starts a speech that basically gives him time to ruin her. Stupid plot. I had such high expectations and it started so great but it soon went downhill.

This is a very entertaining sci-fi flick if you don't compare it to every movie you've ever seen.
I don't know of any movie that doesn't have room for improvement ort is perfect.
Besides, wasn't this taken from a book? How is it the movie's fault if it ""stole"" an element from another film? Blame the author, not the filmmaker.
I give it an 8 out of ten because it wasn't your ordinary film, it grabbed my attention and held it, wasn't TOO gory, and there wasn't a lot of foul language. (... and ""Yes, Margaret,"" there are still movie fans who don't like to be bombarded with coarse or even crude language, even in this age of ""anything goes."" It doesn't have to!)
If you, in spite of the bad reviews, watched ""Jupiter Ascending"" and liked it, you will probably like ""Mortal Engines."" If you listen to the critics on ""ME"" or ""JA"" and didn't watch them, you robbed yourself of a pleasurable experience pr two.

The synopsis is brilliant, and the artwork and CG is beautiful. The problem lies with the incomplete character depth and blatant lazy writing and editing skills. Throughout the movie i never once got involved with even one of the characters. Was there even a protagonist? To be honest i had more empathy for the antagonist lord Elrond of scrap london than anyone else just because of acting quality and character introduction.The story had alot of holes in it and most of the time i had the feeling i was watching stand alone scenes in the wrong order of context and had to actively search for it.
Characters they didn't bother to properly introduce gave meaningful looks to one another at one inappropriate time and at another unreasonable moment out of nowhere blast into full dialog mode while flying towards the rushed end of the movie.

I honestly think that was its biggest problem. This should have been two movies. If they were going to adapt the quartet of books into a single film, then they should have entirely cut out the character of Valentine's daughter, who was interesting but ultimately didn't do anything of consequence; they could have regained at least 15 minutes of film time and used it to fill out the ending.

969,dunduckuty,Great! Not amazing but so so refreshing.,10,7 December 2018,"Visuals: Outstanding
Setting and Concept: Refreshing and Exciting
Acting: Passable
Music: Loud
Story: Fine, but not anything new.This movie is a perfect popcorn blockbuster. It is refreshing in the age of endless superhero films and Star Wars sequels and for that reason alone it deserves support. I think the critics who are hating this are out of their minds. But I also think it is not perfect. As a fan of the books, I would have prefered slightly better versions of the two primary leads. However, Anna Fang was badass. I really liked the villian Valentine as well.Note: the 10 stars is my futile attempt to counter harmful 1 star reviews. This movie deserves to at least break even. The amount of artistry is incredible and I would watch the sequel (the books get better). Realistically a 7.5/10.",Mortal Engines
970,gregg-hodson,Why?,3,9 December 2018,"If it's not broken, don't fix it. The film is visually stunning and transports you deep into the heart of Philip Reeve's universe, but why was it nesessary to deviate so wildly from the book towards the end? I understand that sometimes characters don't fit in to the narrative in cinema, due to limited time constraints, and that some characters may do different things to move the story along. However making a completely different character the main protagonist just completely changes the feel of the story. As a result, we don't get to experience the vilification and ultimate redemption of one of the best characters in the book. Having watched the film I can see no reason for changing the story in this way, and it's left me feeling a little sad and disappointed - just as I was with Ready Player One.
Philip Reeve is on record as saying ""I think Mortal Engines would make a good film if it were done properly, so I'd like to see that; just so long as they don't make Hester pretty.""

It is awfully quiet for a movie of LITERAL CITY-TANKS.Desperately lacking in the humour-department, the movie completely falls through, and what, on paper, looked like an interesting and original story is completely wasted in the hands of director Christian Rivera.Visually stunning, but lacking in every other department.",Mortal Engines

But it is super enjoyable and gorgeous. No pointless action scenes just for the sake of action, the plot actually advanced with each scene, which is refreshing in a time of dumb, action packed, and pointless superhero movies. The steam-punky setting is also a nice break.I haven't read the books, which I hear are pretty different, but this made me want to read them - it makes you want to know more about the world.

I needn't have worried! I should have trusted Peter Jackson! Almost perfectly how I imagined them to be. The actors chosen for the roles were spot on, the sets were superb and my biggest worry, how on earth would they do justice to a London on wheels.....well better than I could have ever imagined.

1023,k-nstone,An adventure worth going on,8,16 December 2018,"Lots of mixed reviews, but I feel this film did a decent job of capturing the grandeur of the world created by the books.
First, what I felt deserves praise:
The visuals in this film are really stunning! From the construction of the mobile cities, to the design of glossy airships and sturdy derigables traversing an Earth gasping to stay alive. mortal Engines is filed with complex beauty that captures your interest.
The film CAN stand on its own. Even if they decide not to move forward with the rest of the story found in the book series, they answer enough of the big plot points to leave most movie-goers satisfied with the way things turned out.
Hester Shaw is actually likeable. In the books, I struggled with caring about her in particular because of her many, MANY flaws and selfish tendancies. In this movie, she is a strong, determined woman, with characteristics that don't make her hateable, but simply human. I felt much more on her side watching than I did reading.Now what I felt fell short:
Character motives. Particularly for Valentine. They changed a major aspect of this character from the books, in a way that seemed unnecessary to me. I feel that they compromised what was a uniquely motivated antagonist with true and interesting intentions, and made him shallow and flat as a main element to the story. His involvement in the books is much more complex, and his motives are entirely different, and I felt that they cheapened him.
I also felt that they left major questions about the world unanswered. Having read the books, I know why the cities move, what the significance of Airhaven and Archangel are, and exactly why there's an entire population of people living on the other side of this massive wall. I feel that they tossed out the intricate complexities of the world and used them only for eye candy without really explaining their past or purpose. Moving cities are cool, but why? (Gotta read the books to find out! Like annoying clickbait)
And lastly, a few changes to the climactic ending really bugged me. Things happened a particular way in the book that are very important for character motives later on. Tom still gets to be a hero, without ripping off Star Wars, returning characters get a much more believable reason for returning, and you get a more solid sense of closure. I'm not sure why they changed things so drastically, but I will say that I do still accept the movie version, simply because it does tie up a lot of its own lose strings, allowing the movie to feel complete.Despite my qualms listed above, I did still really enjoy this film and I think it deserves more attention for the remaining stories to be told. I also would encourage those who were flirting with the idea of seeing it in theatres to do so, simply for the benefit of seeing the grandiose design of the world on a large screen with immersive audio. It is a spectacular adventure, even if it's missing the complexities that exist in the pages of the books. After all, you can't have EVERYTHING from a book included in a film. And this one includes enough to give you what you want.",Mortal Engines

Mortal Engines could have been a shiny gem, and easily a 3 hour movie, instead there's character development missing, mostly backstory time. there's a particularly wonderful character that could have been one of the strong points of the movie, we only know him through flashbacks underwhelming it's present journey. dialogue is at times weak, or missing, characters don't talk enough about the situations or world they live in, LOTR is more balanced and insightful in that regard. Special effects are wonderful and great care was taken to deliver on that aspect. There's a great steampunk/anime vibe, great vistas and great locations. Acting is good through out all of the cast, although to some characters is given too much importance or key events on the movie, but we really don't know much about them. Music and sound is also great. you'll leave the theater satisfied but underwhelmed and thinking, this needed just a bit more time. score 13/20",Mortal Engines

The actors performances were wonderful, they truly were their characters. I really felt the emotion and was pulled into the world they created. Loved Hera Hilmar as Hester Shaw and Jihae as Anna Fang. Everyone was great but they were definitely my favourites. I rewinded so many scenes while watching, for action sequences and for perfectly delivered dialogue. Music was fabulous too.Just a few negatives. Why was one of the historical artefacts in the museum at the beginning huge Minion statues? An odd choice, in my opinion. The final battle sequence got clunky at times but I was still pleased with how it ended. After a point, we don't see Bevis Pod (Ronan Raftery) again. Like I don't know what happened to him. He was with Katherine (Leila George - she was great) and then nothing. I kept thinking he'd pop up somewhere at the end.Even so, I loved this movie so much that I posted my first review on IMDB.

Philip Reeves book ""Mortal Engines"" is a a great story, not because of the ingenuity of the futuristic imaginary world it describes but of the richness of its characters, the great descriptions of the city, its guilds and their different mentalities and the key central tragic figure of Thaddeus Valentine.The director has in its hand the opportunity to create a post apocalyptic Greek tragedy, create empathy and strong connections between the characters and the audience and all he delivers is a fast food story, predictable, easily digested and tossed.CGI, casting, screenplay and actor picks are great, but what's the bloody point.

The idea of cities chasing cities would have been more fun but the film rather focuses on Vendetta and revenge and YA romance and all the other tropes a film can follow . The first 10 to 15 minutes were the most engaging and also the part regarding Strike, the resurrected Robot Zombie. His character seems to be the most interesting. The rest are just every other characters you have seen in hundred other films. The film does nothing new and is laughably predicatable.

The movie brought an original story line which is very rare to see in today's movies. Where the movie fell flat on the ground was the casting of jihae Kim. Her introduction into the movie was nothing but laughable. Her sense of humor was that of an obtuse triangle. In such a lead role, a replacement of Chris Pratt and his guardian of the galaxy sense of humor would have elevated the movie from a 6 to an 8 100%. Ruphio from Peter Pan would have objectivity been a better choice. Tom hardy could have potentially saved this movie in this role.

1074,isawhim,"Great potential, but not what I expected",8,15 December 2018,"It was sad that they crammed all of this information into one single movie. This would have made an awesome television series, or at-least a trilogy. Ultimately, it was not what I expected, from the trailers. However, it wasn't bad.The movie could have been three hours long and still not had enough time to gratify my desire for story information. There was so much going on, but so much skimmed-over. I am sure that they edited-out a LOT of information, to shorten the movie and lost something in the editing process. Almost every phrase has important information about what is going on. That, in this case, can be a bad thing, if you don't hear something said, or use the rest-room half way through the movie.Giant, towering, moving cities, verses smaller, interconnected, moving cities, with land-bound cities and various scavenger herds. However, you only see one set of each. That was the biggest disappointment here. Literally, it lost one star, just for that, but only one. The things shown were worth the showing and were shown enough for you to get the point. They were accessories to the plot.Ultimately, the plot had other elements which helped form the current world, but those fell short of mental gratification. A big war, a cyborg hunter, a relationship which should have been the focus, but wasn't. Well, if it was, it was poorly represented. The relationship which was to be the core of the movie, fell short of interest, as if it was just another fact of the situation. This lost two stars for that, but gained one too. Personally, I hate when the ONLY thing they focus on, is some trivial ""relationship"", as if it were the movie itself.Thankfully, beyond the previews, there is still a LOT to see within the movie, but the previews were misleading to me. Not a fault of the previews, but rather, my own drifting mind. I literally built-up a whole mini-series, in my head, before my rump ever took a nest in the theater. I like movies that can capture my mind like that. This movie captured my mind, fed it well, let it escape and captured it again.For the record, there is almost no ""mushy"" or ""sappy"" parts. I don't even think they kissed! Though, you could tell that they wanted to, a few times. Sort-of anti-climatic there. I would have enjoyed the movie a bit more, if there was some kind of virtuous element. However, it was all about a single, justifiable, revenge to a questionable event. Something was lost, in the editing, I am sure. This was one of those ""holes"", which I think others are talking about. Honestly, it made the whole movie feel like a giant preview for a series. However, it left nothing of substance that could be used for a series or even a trilogy. I can't even remember a single characters name. Nor was there one I wanted to remember.",Mortal Engines

And it is so stunning to look at it is worth seeing on the big screen for that alone. The performances are mostly strong, and save a few slightly cringe worthy moments and occasional clunky dialogue, this is an enthralling peice of cinema with so much to admire I'd urge anyone who enjoys fantasy and epic movies to go and see it.I've never reviewed here before and felt compelled to do so due to finding the critic reviews so unfair. It seems as if the success of a movie really depends not so much on it's merits, but on opinions of people who have somehow managed to find employment discussing them. We're all allowed to express opinions (the slight hypocrisy of my writing this hasn't escaped me) but so much effort has gone into creating a world I love and so many things have been done so well that it will be a real shame if this spectacular film fizzles out at the box office without, I think, being given a fair chance. Especially as it would be really wonderful to see the other stories from the world of Mortal Engines materialise. Suggestions such as the film being years too late are incomprehensible to me, when really it gave me two hours of escapist pleasure, regardless of whether there have been too many other movies of the same genre of late.Go and see the film, and make up your own mind, as it feels to me like many a mind has been made up too soon...",Mortal Engines

1108,upbeattitan,Visually stunning!,6,12 December 2018,I loved the visuals and the story line of this movie but I wish they had taken the time to grow the characters.The movie clocked in at 2 hours but it felt very rushed.,Mortal Engines

1110,sergarlantyrell,Cringy. A bad film and an even worse book adaptation.,2,15 December 2018,"Disclaimer: I am writing this as one who had read and enjoyed the books.I'm not sure where to start other than I have never been more disappointed by a film adaptation of a book, and it's not a good film in it's own right either.The good: the visuals are incredible! I wasn't sure if they could pull it off but the cities look amazing, and somehow feel believable. But that's it.The bad: Exposition ruins the dialogue for the first 1/2 hour and continues to be lifeless throughout. There's no character development. Rather than being many shades of grey, all the characters, good and bad, feel 1 dimensional.The subtle change in leads from Tom to Hester (though fashionable in 2018) had a profound impact on the feel of the film, loosing the feel of a story from the perspective of a teenage boy who loves his city and everything about their way of life, and then seeing first hand the perspective of the prey and the anti-traction league, and coming to sympathize with them, finally seeing Valentine for what he is and resolving that he must stop his beloved city at whatever cost. Instead the film focuses on vengeance, which is far less impactful.While talking of Hester Shaw, even with that scar, Hera was still far too beautiful to represent someone so hideously disfigured as Hester. Especially when that disfigurement is so central to her character and the story. A little bit more in the prosthetics and makeup department would have gone a long way.The accents.... oh my goodness, the accents! It might fly for american audiences, but Tom's accent is so cringy, though not as bad as Pomeroy, who for whatever reason is putting on a really bad African accent for no apparent reason, especially because Colin Salmon is from Bedfordshire and has no such accent. Also Hester and Anna having inexplicably American accents felt really out of place.One relatively minor thing was given the amazing job the design team did with London and the other towns, they are apparently unaware of what an airship looks like. So rather than the charming steam punk tech airships we get space ships and jet propelled dragon flies. And Airhaven was a mess.The book's main antagonist, the engineers guild doesn't even get a mention, while their leader Magnus Chrome, is reduced to insignificance too. Instead Valentine is elevated to pantomime levels of villainy. AND WHAT HAPPENED TO PANZERSTADT-BAYREUTH?Without giving away spoilers for the ending, it was colossal let down, trading the fate of London for the fate Batmunkh Gompa is frankly insulting to the emotional intelligence of the audience in assuming that they can't cope with a bitter-sweet ending and all the mixed emotions that come with that.Overall the film felt like an adaptation of a young adult novel for an audience of children, and in so doing oversimplified everything to the point where there is nothing worth going to see left.
I hope in 5-10 year time, after this film has been forgotten, someone remakes this with a director who actually read and liked the books.",Mortal Engines
1111,jaybug-99040,Almost seemed like a different story from the book,4,16 December 2018,"I read the book about 2 weeks before the movie was released, so the story and main topics were fresh on my mind when watching it. There were really a lot of places were they took the story in a completely different direction from the book, like the Airhaven scene where Shrike just falls over and dies after a slightly meaningful scene talking about how he loved Hester, but in the book there is a very meaningful and emotional scene where Shrike saves Hester and Tom, and then once everything seems to be figured out, then Tom kills shrike. This scene in the book is one of the first scenes that make tom brave and strong, rather than scared and dumb, in the movie however tom just seemingly becomes brave out of nowhere when london blows up the shield wall, which also doesn't happen in the book... All in all it was great movie wise with great Visuals, and funny moments, but instead of skipping over small non-important parts, they completely changed the story",Mortal Engines
1112,babnpr,Great CGI and balance of 3D content,8,16 December 2018,"I am always wary of 3D movies being either headache causing overdone or having superfluous 3D content just because they can. Mortal Engines strikes a great balance for those who like 3D but only when it contributes to the content.The movie itself was very well done albeit far fetched as are most post apocalyptic films. The acting was great with near perfect casting and the actors clearly ""got into"" their roles. So many new faces but none I would not mind seeing in another movie, perhaps something to continue the story after the climactic ending. There are at least two possible storylines to pursue but I won't mention them as doing so would be 'spoilers' for those who have not seen the movie.Worth a watch and worth the added cost of 3D screenings!",Mortal Engines

I am glad I did because this movie was awesome!! Super cool graphics and the movie had my attention from the first scene to the last. I'm not surprised it's a flop because again, it didn't have my attention at first but it's totally worth your time! Best movie I've seen all year besides Avengers.",Mortal Engines

1117,iolaemeyer,The world is amazing- characters less so,7,18 December 2018,"The Mortal Engines books got me into steampunk five years ago, and this movie did not disappoint. The CGI was fantastic and the world created on screen did total justice to the steampunk genre- which did distract me from the slightly disappointing characters. While I cannot really fault the acting, there was little character development, or rather, little development we are shown. For example, Hester goes from claiming she would leave Tom to die, to saving him at risk to herself in the next scene.However, I really enjoyed the film, especially cinematography. Some really clever shots were used that added an extra layer of emotion to the film (combined with excellent music) -such as the extreme close-ups of Strike's eyes and teeth through the prison cell, and the brilliant shot of Hester's scarred face after she shares her story with Tom.Having said this, it's probably a good thing I last read these books 5 years ago. Several important changes were made, and some less important (ie Hester's face is no longer hideously scarred, ruining my hopes for a heroine who is not stunningly attractive) so don't expect a movie totally true to the book. But as a stand-alone movie, this one is pretty good.",Mortal Engines
1118,thomasord-72135,"Unbelievable CGI,",7,20 December 2018,"This is the perfect film for those wanting other world escapism, a la Avatar. The special effects are unrivalled on any other film i've seen, literally draw dropping. The opening scene is out of this world! Edge of the seat stuff.Yes it does become abit predictable and it does steal themes from other films but it's the special effects, and the fantasy world that's created which make this film a winner. Not much thinking needed, just sit back and enjoy the visual extravaganza on show!",Mortal Engines
1119,continuumevolution,Mortal Engines: Rise - The World of the Traction Cities.,10,21 December 2018,"Mortal Engines is a different kind of movie, one that brings you closer to the truth.Everyone says don't believe the hype except of course if the hype is for something to fail. The movie Mortal Engines will be a cult classic - guaranteed.The only question is did you experience it on the big screen when you had the chance?The critics tell us that there is just too much competition for Mortal Engines to succeed.Can you even compare a big concept movie to a comic book movie depicting an underwater army of muscle bound fish men riding giant seahorses and sharks?If not for the CGI most movies on offer these days are just children's cartoons marketed cynically to adults.Another criticism levelled at Mortal Engines is that the source material for the movie is just too old and therefore out-of-date. The first book 'Mortal Engines' was penned in 2001, with the last in the series 'A Darkling Plain' published in March 2006, over ten years ago.To put things in perspective, Superman first appeared in comic book form in 1938, Batman in 39, Aquaman in 41. The first Star Wars Movie 'A New Hope' was released in May, 1977 - over 41 years ago. Transformers first aired as an animated kids programme in 1984 - that is 34 years ago. There isn't much playing on the big screens anymore that isn't a reboot/rehash of an idea that was first conjured up almost half a century ago, so stop telling me that due to the books being a paltry ten years old they are now irrelevant - that is absolute crap.The main criticism levelled at the movie is the story itself. How can the narrative structure be at fault when it is the only big budget offering based on a book, a highly acclaimed one at that. If the narrative packed anymore punch it would have knocked me out. As for utilising more Hollywood star power, haven't we seen enough fantasy and sci-fi roles given to Tom Cruise (no offense Tom).To have some fresh new faces on screen was as refreshing as the movie itself. We see Tom Natsworthy develop as a character from an abiding Traction city-dweller to a more hardened and resilient freedom fighter. We also witness the transformation of Hester Shaw's character from hardened outcast in pursuit of revenge to someone who learns to trust again, to love. We see the endgame in our technological pursuit to surpass nature in the robotised cadaver called Shrike.What is the movie about?The real question is how far do you want to go?If we could literally see what our combined actions looked like as a species then it would look like something akin to Mortal Engines. Yes, it is that kind of movie.
Even the name 'Mortal Engines' signifies that nothing we create lasts forever. If the whole concept of mobile predator cities seems outlandish then remember it was intentionally meant to be so. The mobile cities are a powerful metaphor for the ridiculousness of our human engineered systems and how far we will go to protect them. This movie poses some of the most profound questions of our age.Such as how far will we go as a species in the fight for limited resources?How far will we go to sustain the unsustainable?If you want more there is also the 60-minute war between China and America that almost ended all human life. The development of powerful weapons capable of not only taking out entire cities, but entire continents. The metaphors in this film are visceral. You don't just understand the concepts but feel them.Watch something new, I dare you.If such a big concept movie can be dismissed so quickly then it sends a chilling message to every future filmmaker, writer and artist hoping to pitch an exciting new idea.It tells us that Hollywood is now closed for business, and that the bean counters who effectively deal with risk management have won.But what have they won?When we stare out across a cultural wasteland populated only by remakes of movie remakes, we will realise that this monopoly on ideas cannot last, that it is as unsustainable as the predator cities themselves, hunting down the last scraps of civilisation.When every comic book series has been adapted for the silver screen, will they then let some new ideas through? And will the public brought up on a steady diet of regurgitated ideas, and repurposed cultural icons be able to even recognise a brand new concept when finally exposed to it?The opening narration to the movie is one of the best ever. This harsh and crackling voice leads us straight into the most breath taking CGI action sequences ever created, all accompanied by a heart pounding score composed by Tom Holkenborg (aka Junkie XL) who also created the soundtrack to Mad Max Fury Road. In this amazing CGI world, which pushed Weta Digital's computers to the limit, we have some great acting by Robert Sheehan and Hera Hilmarsdottir, a fantastic Icelandic actress.What more could you ask for?If creating a perfect film is not enough in this modern environment then what hope is there for the rest of us creators?If this movie doesn't succeed then the age of big concept movies is dead. There I have said it.Mortal Engines - the truth is out there. Go and see it for yourselves.",Mortal Engines
1120,rampasupuleti-82981,Mortal Engines- A Cult Classic?,7,22 December 2018,"""Mortal Engines"" appears to be on its way to the dubious distinction of the top blockbuster bomb of 2018, which prompts one to wonder about the vagaries of movie buffs and their appreciation or the lack of it for post-apocalyptic, dystopian books/movies. As a genre, these kind of movies have their hits and misses. It appears ""Mortal Engines"" may have missed the box office mark by a wide margin, but it would be interesting to see if it gets any critical acclaim. This movie, which is based on a book series, has to be seen and appreciated at different levels and the 150 million dollar question for the producers is whether or not the audience is that discerning.At the basic post-apocalyptic, dystopian movie level, the audience is looking for a baseline story/premise with imaginative landscapes and spectacular special effects. ""Mortal Engines"" does not disappoint at this level. The basic premise, like any dystopian theme is an apocalyptic event- ""The 60 minute war"" which destroys Earth as we know it and the nations/cities that remain rebuild/regroup as mobile cities on huge machines, devouring other smaller cities also on wheels for survival. This is just as good or bad a premise as any other found in the movies of this genre. The argument that it is a little far-fetched is hypocritical to say the least, given the fact that the setting by definition is post-apocalyptic and the audience seems to have accepted far less convincing themes in this genre.The special effects can be classified as spectacular if not mind-blowing. The machines with cities on top-particularly London, are well imagined and the post-apocalyptic vistas and landscapes in the movie are impressive. The world is shown as a desolate place with arid landscapes with huge machines moving across in the first half, which is like most other movies in this genre, but as the movie progresses, we get to see another landscape in sharp contradistinction, which is almost Idyllic with cities in the foothills of snowy mountains ascending into vistas of heavenly clouds and aerial dwellings in the sky.At another level, the audience will see the secondary plot of revenge which in a convoluted way leads to the prevention of another apocalyptic event just like the one that destroyed the world to begin with. ""Mortal Engines"" does not offer anything new in terms of a revenge sub plot, but this aspect of the movie gives some scope for the actors to demonstrate their histrionic abilities. The fact that most audiences may remember the characters and not the actors in this movie may be a testament to their acting abilities.At a tertiary level, what the audience may or may not see is the message/messages contained within the movie. The theme of western aggression runs as an undercurrent in the movie with some classic allusions like ""learning from history"" and ""what have we done?""-a version of the quote from the pilot of the B-29 that dropped the first atomic bomb. The movie appears to draw parallels between the landscapes and cultures with London inhabiting the bleak and arid landscapes separated by a wall from the beautiful and heavenly eastern landscapes. In the final scene, after London's aggressive assault on the wall is foiled, the eastern civilization extends the proverbial hand to welcome their western brethren. While this may be the subtle message that can be perceived, a sub-plot conveys the message of love conquering even the most evil of machines.At each individual level, ""Mortal Engines"" seems to meet and even crosses the mark, but comprehensively as a movie and particularly at the box office, does it cater to most if not all of its audiences? Though it may not be as successful financially, will it go on to become one of those ""Cult Classics""? Only time can tell.",Mortal Engines

1122,gabriellewertzbaugher,"Great potential, but modern film quality.",7,27 December 2018,"The world, visuals, and interactions between the characters are solid and great and leave you wanting to know more about all of it.But in order to save time and money they attempted to cram four books worth of information into one movie. Each characters backstory then devolves into 10 min expose or backflashes telling the audience matter of fact everything; and even then sometimes not all of it.It's a shame that they were handed a perfectly fleshed out world and decided to do this to it. Would have done better as 2-3 movies, each focusing on one or two characters and intertwining with the next movie.All that being said, it is still worth watching in the theaters for the visuals and if you can handle the repetitive dribble that the comic industry has done for their movies story wise, then this will be a small, but fresh breath of air.",Mortal Engines

Great Visuals

MusicCon'sI want to write a bit in this bit because I felt they tried to cram too much into the film in one go. Peter Jackson wanted to make 4 films out of this and to be fair this will be the one and only.The problem I found was not so much the characters but how the story brought them together there wasn't enough time and something that if the film had gone on to make more they could have spread it out. Everything was rushed from the start to the end you didn't get time to really feel the characters which given time could have stopped this film from flopping.Overall though I enjoyed the film having not read the books or heard of them I'm not sure where they could have gone with the film with how it ended.I get the feeling they kind of knew this wouldn't have gone beyond the first film.I gave it a 9 because despite feeling a little rushed there was enough entertainment to keep me watching it till the end.If you haven't seen it I think you should it's a bit of a love/hate film for some people",Mortal Engines

1139,derekelsley,"Great CGI, Relatively unknown Actors perform well",8,21 February 2019,"As with all series, it's initially pot luck which story to choose for the first movie; This one could have benefitted from a 'Prequel' to explain how the need for these mobile predator City/Towns came about [perhaps a composite of 'Fever Crum' 'A Web of Air' & 'Scribeners Moon' the written 'Prequels' ++).... (Perhaps UNIVERSAL could make this then re-release Mortal Engines). The story has deviations from the book and some do unfortunately have an adverse effect on the 'real' story.
With regard to the relationship between Hester and Tom in the film, some have said that Hester seems false, but I would disagree, when you consider that Hester has been isolated from her own kind for so long, and Tom is a 'Geek'! If one scene highlights this, it's when 'Shrike' is about to Kill Tom & Hester pleads for his life, at which point it's 'Shrike' that says Hester Loves Tom, Hester's expression is initially one of puzzlement followed by one of realisation.... Full marks here for Here Hilmar.So in summing up, I believe this movie to be entertaining and worth viewing. If you must read the book then read after viewing (better still read the prequels before!)",Mortal Engines
