0,MartinHafer,Offensive AND stupid!,2,5 June 2008,"This is one of the only films I have ever reviewed that I honestly must admit I did NOT finish the film. While I watched most of it, I found myself so irritated that I finally just turned it off for fear that my brain would suffer permanent damage---it was that stupid and offensive.Now the fact that the film offends my religious sensibilities wasn't the main reason I didn't like the film. Heck, I am willing to see films that offend or shock me if they have some deeper meaning or are cleverly written. I have loved some of John Waters' early films and they are VERY offensive, but they also had some cleverness or depth to them. But a film like DOGMA that is deliberately offensive AND full of such shallow and lousy performances as well as writing--that is unforgivable! It was as if, again and again, in order to shock the viewer, they went for cheap laughs and obscenities. My attitude is if you are an atheist or agnostic or whatever, at least have the strength of convictions to try to say what you think or be willing to mock conventional religion INTELLIGENTLY. Having Jay and Silent Bob (the poster kids for idiocy) walk about cursing or having the Virgin Mary II working for an abortion clinic just don't seem funny--just shocking and cruel.See it if you want--I don't particularly care. However, don't (like many have tried) try to convince me that this is witty or funny. What's funny about this film? There were very few genuine laughs in the entire thing.",Dogma
1,SnoopyStyle,Jay and Silent Bob funny,6,28 March 2015,"The fallen Angel of Death Loki (Matt Damon) and his friend Bartleby (Ben Affleck) find a way to return to Heaven. Cardinal Glick (George Carlin) is revitalizing the church and rededicates St. Michael's Church in New Jersey. The papal sanctioned entrance allows all those who enter to have their sins forgiven. The two angels need to walk through the archway and then die to reenter Heaven. Catholic Bethany Sloane (Linda Fiorentino) works at an abortion clinic and is struggling for faith. She is tasked by the angel Metatron (Alan Rickman), the voice of God, to stop the two angels or else it could undo all of God's work. To help her, he sends her two prophets, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith). Azrael (Jason Lee) and his hockey playing goons try to stop her. Along the way, they are aided by the 13th Apostle Rufus (Chris Rock) and the muse Serendipity (Salma Hayek).There are just so much religious exposition. It probably took up half of movie to explain who these characters are and what they represent. Towards the end, the whole thing gave me a headache. I think it is something very compelling for Catholics but less so for most everybody else. I guess all the complicated history is part of Kevin Smith's commentary on the religion.Some of the movie is more fun than other. I love Jay and Silent Bob. They're funny in this movie. Linda Fiorentino is a little dour but she's still pretty good as the lead. I got bored with the Damon Affleck massacre tour. It's not funny or compelling. The road trip works in the first half with some fun introductions of Chris Rock and Salma Hayek. The second half gets bog down from time to time. I probably would be happier with ""Jay and Silent Bob Save Creation"".",Dogma
2,classicsoncall,"""Remember: Even God has a sense of humor.""",8,11 May 2018,"I can understand how this film would offend a lot of folks, Catholics in particular. I'm Catholic myself, and I think you almost need that perspective to be 'in' on some of the characters and humor in the story. Though I do find the excessive use of the 'F' word to be off-putting and tasteless, I think there was the germ of a good idea presented here with the suggestion that God can be appreciated better as a thoughtful and loving Deity than a harsh and demanding one. I mean, even George Burns thought so when he took on the role. That business about the plenary indulgence loophole was kind of a brilliant stroke, but I don't think God would allow himself to be taken in that easily by the kind of argument posited by the story's main premise. But hey, nice try on the part of writer and director Kevin Smith, who's role as Silent Bob can be appreciated for the fact that he actually does say something from time to time. If there's a major downside to the picture it would be that hideous excremental creature concocted for the lowest common denominator movie fans. That could have been left out and the picture wouldn't have suffered a bit. As for the choice of Alanis Morrisette as 'God', well, by that time in the story I think there was a point to be made about the whole concept of God and religion, and that the question of the Infinite is just a bit too much for any individual to contemplate and understand, so go with an interpretation you can be at peace with. After that, just say a prayer.",Dogma
3,gavin6942,My Least Favorite Kevin Smith Film,6,12 June 2015,"An abortion clinic worker with a special heritage is called upon to save the existence of humanity from being negated by two renegade angels trying to exploit a loop-hole and reenter Heaven.This is a much-loved part of Kevin Smith's universe, with many people considering it his best film. For me, I always thought it was his worst. After the strongly-scripted trilogy of ""Clerks"", ""Mallrats"" and ""Chasing Amy"", suddenly we start getting some strange things like a giant poop monster. Really? That right there negates all the clever ideas you tried to add to the script.This is also the point in Smith's career where the budget was getting too big. The films got bigger than they needed to be and the casts got more famous. And why? This did nothing to improve the core of Smith's work, which does not succeed on larger scales.",Dogma
4,lee_eisenberg,"In nomine Jay, Silent Bob, et spiritus...uh, I mean everyone else in Kevin Smith's movies...",10,9 July 2005,"Everyone likes a movie that irks religious people, but ""Dogma"" is beyond that. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck play Loki and Bartleby, fallen angels who plan to reenter Heaven and thus undo all existence. So, some loyal angels call upon Bethany Sloane (Linda Fiorentino) to stop them. From there, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) have some great lines, as do thirteenth apostle Rufus (Chris Rock), Metatron (Alan Rickman), Serendipity (Salma Hayek) and Cardinal Glick (George Carlin). Jason Lee plays Azrael, the evilest demon imaginable.Mostly, the movie is an excuse to be wacky and have references to comic books. I think that my favorite scene was in the restaurant right after Serendipity tells everyone that she was responsible for 19 of the top twenty highest-grossing movies of all time. You will probably be blown away by what follows. I haven't seen the DVD, but apparently, one of the special features is a Sunday School teacher telling us that we'll go to Hell if we watch ""Dogma"". Well, if that's the case, then tell Satan that I'm on my way; I LOVED this movie!",Dogma
5,jboothmillard,Dogma,7,21 April 2009,"The only film from director Kevin Smith I had seen was Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and I was looking forward to seeing the lead characters again in this religious satire. Basically Cardinal Ignatius Glick (George Carlin) announces many changes being made to improve Catholicism's fading image, including a Buddy Jesus, and the re-dedication ceremony day when all who enter the church will have their sins forgiven, and be morally clean. This attracts the attention of angels stuck on Earth, Bartleby (Ben Affleck) who talked Loki (Matt Damon) into quitting his position as angel of death. They are both banned from Heaven to serve eternity in the place worse than Hell, Wisconsin, and as they travel to the church, Loki wants to get back into God's good book by killing all people he could consider sinners. Abortion clinic worker Bethany Sloane (Linda Fiorentino) with a special heritage is visited by voice of God angel Metatron (Alan Rickman) who tells her that if the two angels get to the church, they will inadvertently cause all existence to end. So with the help of prophets Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself, only uttering a few words somewhere in the middle), and soon joined by the 13th Apostle Rufus (Chris Rock), they are determined to get to the church and stop the angels from entering Heaven. Also starring Jason Lee as Azrael, Razzie nominated Salma Hayek as Serendipity, Ratatouille's Janeane Garofalo as Liz, Alanis Morissette as God and Ethan Suplee as Noman the Golgothan. Unsurprisingly this offended many Catholic groups when it was released, and while the film is a little patchy, it is the moments of gross humour and the unique script that make this film work. Very good!",Dogma
6,dbdumonteil,losing my religion...,6,17 September 2003,"Making a movie that aims at laughing at religion is in itself a delicate operation but Kevin Smith managed to get out very well of this deadlock. His weird but funny movie is based on a plain and simple story. But ""Dogma"" is especially a movie that mocks at religion and its prejudice. It suggests a zany and blasphemous picture: thus God is a young woman (an unexpected Alanis Morrisette), thus prophets smoke a lot of grass and masturbate a lot, thus Jesus was actually black.""Dogma"" also enjoys an outstanding performance. The only fault of the movie is that it's very talkative. Nevertheless, no matter if you're a believer or you aren't, Kevin Smith's movie remains a success.",Dogma
7,Quinoa1984,Funny and Furious- Kevin Smith's best,10,20 January 2000,"Kevin Smith's Dogma is a fantastic satirical comedy that is filled with the comedy and religious attacks that only Smith can put in a movie (The Best on-screen duo of the decade Jay played by Jason Mewes and Silent Bob played by Smith return as mall rats turned prophets).  Also returning from other Smith films are Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Jason Lee and Dwight Ewwell.  And that plus some new characters make this a great comedy.But the element that makes this the best Smith movie is not only the comedy. It is filled with discussions about how Catholicism can be changed and altered and it doesn't back down from controversial issues (Chris Rock as the 13th apostle explains that Jesus was black and hypocrisy has changed the bible).  Yet, this film is not to be taken seriously though.  It is a silly comedy that includes a hip priest (George Carlin makes a great cameo as this priest), a god (that we can assume is Canadian) and two angels that act like the usual guys in Smith films.  True, some of it's dialouge sounds better if it was read than seen, but thats fine.  This film is still a great piece of comedy from Smith and not only his, but one of the years, best films.",Dogma
8,michaelRokeefe,Be fully aware of what you pray for.,3,25 September 2001,"Witty humor from director/writer Kevin 'Silent Bob' Smith. A cold, disjointed and satirical leap into theology and catholicism. If you happen to not be Catholic, you feel on the outside of an inside joke. A young woman from New Jersey takes on the cause of saving the world from two 'loose cannon' angels. A very diverse cast that includes:Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Linda Fiorentino, George Carlin, Alan Rickman, Chris Rock and Salma Hayek. Alanis Morissette plays God. Nuff said? There is also Jay and Silent Bob. Be ready for strong language, crude humor and sexual dialogue. Fluff the wings and loosen the robe...you're in for a weary ride.",Dogma
9,sunwarrior13,Thou Shall Not Stop Laughing,9,6 October 2012,"Would you believe that the last living descendant of Jesus Christ is a woman working at an abortion clinic in Illinois? And that she's been sent on a holy mission with two minor characters from Clerks and Mallrats as her guides? Prepare to suspend any and all disbelief as you watch the religious satire Dogma.It is written and directed by Kevin Smith, who also stars in the film along with an ensemble cast that includes Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Linda Fiorentino, Alan Rickman, Bud Cort, Salma Hayek, Chris Rock, Jason Lee, George Carlin, Janeane Garofalo, Alanis Morissette, and Jason Mewes.Bethany has been disappointed in life and has found her faith severely tested after her husband leaves her when she discovers she cannot have children. So Bethany is all the more puzzled when she's approached by Metatron,a grumpy angel.Metatron wants her to help him stop Bartleby and Loki, two fallen angels who were ejected from paradise, have escaped from exile and are heading to New Jersey. If they are able to pass through the arc of a certain church, it will prove God is fallible and the world will come to a swift end. Bethany has no idea what to do or why she's been given this project, but she heads out anyway, with her assigned assistants Jay, an appallingly rude former dope dealer and self-styled ladies man, and Silent Bob. Along the way, Bethany picks up more helpers, including a celestial muse named Serendipity and Rufus, who claims to have been the 13th apostle and that Jesus owes him 12 dollars.It is about the importance of faith, if not organized religion.I echo Kevin Smith's statement about this film.It is a talky, farcical comedy of cosmic errors is clever. But it's clever in a deeply juvenile way.As God would probably say to the viewer,""Thou Shall Not Stop Laughing"".Overall,it is a push-the-envelope coarse, thematically ambitious, and most dangerously self-consciously respectful and thoughtful on matters of faith and religion.",Dogma

11,Theo Robertson,Ruined Potential,2,7 October 2003,"DOGMA opens with a man getting beaten to death with hockey sticks hinting it`s going to be a pitch black comedy and Matt Damon`s opening spiel also offers proof this is going to be comedy of the darkest order putting the boot into organized religion , but when Alan Rickman turns up with the most camp and probably worst performance of his career alarm bells started ringing in my ears . Things go from bad to worse when the language grows more and more profane with characters unable to speak a sentence without peppering it with "" F*** "" and "" Sh*t "" . It`s always a sign of desparation in a comedy when characters resort to bad language in order generate laughs. There is a memorable sequence of Salma Hayek in a pink bikini doing some pole dancing but it`s an ordeal sitting through the dross that precedes this and DOGMA would have worked far better if all the scenes not featuring Salma had been edited out",Dogma
12,preppy-3,NOT sacreligious!,7,22 November 1999,"The Catholic groups who are screaming outrage at this movie have obviously never seen it.  It's, at heart, a very religious comedy with foul language and gross-out humor.  God IS NOT mocked--some of his followers are.  That aside, this is a movie with two angels, banished from heaven, who have found a loophole to get back in.  Problem is, they'll destroy existence if they do it.  So a variety of characters (some can't be called people) race off to stop them.  There are some really wonderful, very funny moments (although I could have lived without the s*** monster), but once too often, the comedy comes to halt to explain the plot.  The plot is needlessly complicated and has way too many characters (Salma Hayek and Jason Lee are wasted).  Also director/writer Smith directs some sequences so confusingly that it's hard to follow what's going on!  He's a good writer but he needs to polish his directing skills.  All the acting is good (except for Damon) and Affleck is incredible at the end.  Worth seeing, but expect some slow moments.",Dogma
13,LeonLouisRicci,This Is One High-School Of Thought,7,28 October 2013,"Comic Book Writer turned Movie Writer/Director Kevin Smith's most Ambitious Movie is Wholly Scattershot and filled with Sophomoric Potty Humor (no surprise there) and too many Scenes that don't work at Best and are Extremely Embarrassing and Awful at Worst.There are some Irreverent and Funny Bits (Buddy Christ) but for everyone that Hits there are Three that not only miss the Mark but the Target (Poop Demon). Stars Damon and Affleck are Flat and are Strained as they Mouth Long, Wordy Explanations about Loopholes in Church Dogma and other Things that are not worth the Effort. There are other Characters, such as God's Voice (Alan Rickman) who must also give Hard to Follow Verbiage about Angel Hierarchy and other such Catholic Mumbo-Jumbo that keeps the Movie from Really Invoking any Real Contemplation.Like Most Comedies not Every Joke Works and not Every Gag is Funny. That is to be Expected. But when the Writer/Director has the Audience at the Ready with some True Satirical Insight, He Loses them Again and Again with Boring Speeches and Fart Repellent.The Set Piece in the Corporate Boardroom is a Prime Example of a Supreme Missed Opportunity. It is Neither Funny, Ironic, or Dark. It is just Dull and Very Unrewarding as is the Overwrought Ending that is a Complete Catastrophe.But Despite all that does not Endear this is still a Playful, and at Times, Engrossing Look in on a Subject that Cries Out for Debate and Seriously Needs some Reflection.

14,lastliberal,A winner on many counts,8,29 April 2007,"It is not often that you get to see a group of stars that you like in a funny movie that also makes some interesting points.Matt Damon (The Bourne Ultimatum ), Linda Fiorentino (Unforgettable). Severus Snape, Jay and Silent Bob, Salma Hayek (Frida), George Carlin, and, of course, God (Alanis Morissette), all join to make this irreverent and funny movie.The premise is so interesting, and the fact that it is set in New Jersey is so appropriate, whether intentional or not. As a recovering Catholic, I remember the teaching of the church that I could basically sin all I want, but if I repent at the end, I will be saved and go to heaven. New Jersey is reputedly the home of many undesirable criminals with vowels on the ends of their names - maybe some of them even relatives of mine - and I know they are predominately Catholic. I am sure they are counting on this ""escape clause,"" just as Loki and Bartleby were counting on the same thing.Yes, while I was laughing, I was also carefully looking at the images {the golden calf (money) we worship} and listening to the lines. There is a wealth of material in this movie and it was thoroughly enjoyable.One to see again and again.",Dogma
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Kind of a disappointment for being done by Kevin Smith, but not bad",7,8 December 2004,"For a long time, I put off watching this movie again and reviewing it. I thought about it might be better to see the other films of the series first... I don't know why, but I haven't been able to get a hold of any other View Askewniverse(to the uninitiated, those that feature the characters of Jay and Silent Bob) films, so the only two I've seen are this and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. So, I can't really say if this is good compared to the previous films in the series. I've seen the film a few times now... don't know how many exactly, since I've just put it on ""play"" a few times while doing other stuff and not paying too much attention to it. So, I've lost track of how many times I've seen it... but I doubt that it's been (attentively) more than three times, this one included. That doesn't sound like much, no? Definitely not too much... so why did I fall asleep during the last fifteen minutes? To make matters worse, I didn't even pay that much attention to it *this* time, either... so what happened? Well, personally I think the problem is the uneventful script... whenever a situation seems to start, a new character is introduced instead of anything actually happening. The viewer has barely picked up who everyone is by the time the film is over... and you know what the problem is? By then, you've stopped caring. Like another reviewer said, there's just too many characters, and as a result, none of them are properly developed or interesting enough to keep you watching. Yes, there is conflict, but it's only introduced once Smith's done pushing every joke or gag that he could possibly come up with for that scene. Now don't get me wrong, I think he has a good sense of humor... maybe even great. Just about any guy can laugh at Jay and Silent Bob. I don't mean to enrage or annoy any fans of Smith here, but I just think he could have done a better job on this. Come on, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back was an instantly re-watchable laugh-a-minute film that had no slow moments... why did this one not seem to move at all? The plot is pretty good, but the pacing seemed off. The acting is all good. The characters are well-written but underdeveloped. The humor is very good, at times great. I didn't laugh as much during this movie as I did during ""Strike Back"", but I did laugh... well, the first time I saw it, anyway. The basic idea is pretty good, as well. I might have found it more funny if I wasn't an atheist... but you can't please everybody. A few quick notes on the various actors; both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were good as angels. Linda Fiorentino does an OK job of carrying the movie. Alan Rickman is good as the highest ranking angel. Chris Rock is funny... not just in the movie, he's funny *period*. Salma Hayek is beautiful as always and gives a pretty good performance, though her character here is pretty much the same type of character that she always does. Jason Lee is cool... both in his character and just about every other movie he's done. Of course, Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith are awesome in their respective roles of Jay and Silent Bob... but that goes without saying for anyone who's seen them in any of the movies. All in all, probably the least entertaining of the Jay and Silent Bob movies, but not bad. Hey, it's Kevin Smith; he's usually funny... right? I recommend this to fans of Kevin Smith and of the other films in the View Askewniverse, and everyone else who is into this kind of humor. Just be prepared that you might find it boring. 7/10",Dogma
16,anaconda-40658,Smith Earns His Wings.,8,16 June 2015,"Dogma (1999): Dir: Kevin Smith / Cast: Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Linda Fiorentino, Chris Rock, Salma Hayek: Extremely original in its theories with a warped view of Christianity. We are given a vision of Alanis Morrissette as God when the Bible indicates that Jesus refers to him as ""Father."" Matt Damon and Ben Affleck star as archangels banished from Heaven yet believe they have found a loophole. They must travel to New Jersey where a century year old Church is holding a ceremony. This would prove God fallible thus threatening human existence. God sends a woman who works at an abortion clinic to stop them. Unique achievement by director Kevin Smith who previously made such intriguing comedies as Chasing Amy and Clerks. Damon and Affleck have tremendous chemistry as two corrupt and lost souls out to escape judgement but ultimately meeting damnation in a violent showdown. Linda Fiorentino brings out the frustration of a woman thrown into the bizarre. Chris Rock plays the 13th Apostle who gives amusing speeches that are not Biblically accurate. He claims that racial discrimination dismissed him from scripture. Salma Hayek plays a muse who appears as a stripper before battling a monster made of toilet waste.

17,HotToastyRag,Full of cynicism,1,14 June 2019,"I once went out with a fellow who said his favorite movie was Dogma, and I never went out with him again. If that sounds snobby to you, you've obviously never seen Dogma. If you have and you still think I'm a snob, then you and I have opposite tastes in movies.This is an incredibly weird movie that pokes fun at religion and will please anyone with a gigantic chip on his shoulder about God and life not being fair. Two fallen angels, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, try to make their way back up to Heaven, but along the way, they discover flaws in religious rules. They're joined by Linda Fiorentino, who works at an abortion clinic, Salma Hayek, a stripper, ""Jay and Silent Bob"" as stoners who are wise and prophetic, and George Carlin, who plays a cardinal. As the movie continues, the audience is treated to lots of violence, attempted drowning using holy water, a monster made of excrement, and Alan Rickman unzipping his pants to show he has the genitalia of a Ken doll.Can you think of any movie that pokes fun at Catholicism any more than that? If you can, go ahead and satisfy yourself. I'll stick with movies and dates with considerably less anger and cynicism.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

18,zetes,Kevin Smith's worthy diatribe over organized religion,7,13 November 1999,"Dogma is probably Kevin Smith's best film so far. It is extremely funny in the same vein as his previous films, and it does a rather good job discussing the confused state of Christianity today. I believe he comes up with a very good synopsis of the situation. The film, though, has some problems. The clashing of serious religious issues with both dirty, sometimes tasteless jokes and hardcore violence was severely jarring. Another problem is that the antagonists and their situation are more interesting than the protagonists. We've seen a lot of stories about people who had to rely in their faith as they are simultaneously losing it. Harvey Keitel's role in From Dusk Till Dawn, for example, was like this. There are also too many protagonists. What the heck did they even need Selma Hayek in the movie for? She plays a Muse, a deity which isn't even Christian. Her character accomplishes little in the way of plot. The angels were much more interesting to me, and the film cuts away from them right when Bartleby, played by Affleck, and Loki, Matt Damon, both have vital character changes. They basically switch personalities, and the movie actually cuts to a standard scene where Linda Fiorentino questions her abilities (the scene reminded me of the one in the Muppet Movie where Kermit the Frog went off from the other Muppets to ask himself if what he was doing was right). Also, the ending goes on for way too long, with six different characters each having their own reconciliation with God (who actually contributes to the soundtrack). It goes on for so long, Smith had Jay and Silent Bob do something funny to keep the audience from growing restless. The biggest problem the movie has, though, is the abundance of explanation. Smith introduces so many different bits of Christian politics and beliefs that nearly a quarter of the entire film consists of characters explaining these things. I can appreciate the amount of detail that Smith included, but it detracts a bit from the film.Although I have a lot of complaints, the film did succeed in passing on its point, and it especially succeeds in being hilarious. If you did like his previous efforts, you will like this. And if you like Jay and Silent Bob, this is the film out of Smith's four that they figure the most prominently. There was a little disappointment in that Silent Bob did not give us any nugget of wisdom as he does in Clerks and Chasing Amy (and Mallrats, if you count the blurb from The Empire Strikes Back). His two lines are pretty dumb. Anyway, 8/10",Dogma
19,Sylviastel,Don't Take this Film Too Seriously! Don't recast Bethany!,7,22 February 2005,"I give this movie and 7 because it's a little out there and unrealistic about Catholicism and religion in general. I am entertained by this film and have seen it repeatedly. This film is not for the religious at all, so don't take it seriously. I also gave it an 7 because I think Kevin Smith could have done a better job. First, he has an excellent cast of actors like Linda Florentino, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Alan Rickman (he deserves something in England for all his wonderful work like an O.B.E. or Officer of the British Empire), Kevin Smith, atheist George Carlin, Janeane Garofalo, Chris Rock, etc. The plot is complicated. Bethany is chosen to save the earth by stopping 2 angels-Damon and Affleck from entering a church in Red Bank, New Jersey (Kevin Smith's territory). I won't get into details about why or where but I am always intrigued to watch this film on Comedy Central repeatedly over the weekend. I loved Alan Rickman's role as the voice of God. While I won't reveal my own personal religious beliefs, I don't think God is that cruel or unforgiving as it is believed in this film. But I loved Affleck and Damon as the Bartleby and Loki. It's worth watching! I was reading about Kevin Smith not getting along with Linda Fiorentino on the set. Supposedly, she is difficult person but she admits it herself. The role of Bethany is wonderfully performed by Linda Fiorentino. Her best scenes are with Affleck and Rickman. Linda is the kind of person who doesn't take stuff from anybody especially directors and some male costars like Kevin Smith. Maybe Linda is the kind of person who prefers control over her own life especially on the set. Women in this business are never treated fairly. It's still a man's game in Hollywood. A game she won't play by their rules. I'm glad that Linda isn't on the cover of some tabloid with her own problems. Anyway last night I did research on Linda Fiorentino. Despite rumors, the director from Last Seduction would like to work with her again. She was in a film directed by Anthony Edwards and acted with him previously in another film as well. The rumors of her difficult personality might be the fact that she was also turned down for the Sharon Stone role in Basic Instinct because her breasts weren't big enough for them. Same thing happened with Kevin Smith, he cared more about her breasts and put a double in her place. How come there are male doubles out there of Ben Affleck or Matt Damon? Sorry but I have to side with Linda. She is beautiful, talented, and intelligent. Regarding the Tommy Lee Jones rumor that he wouldn't do Men in Black II if Fiorentino was in it. THe director said that he offered the part to Linda but it was too small and her character was going to be killed off. She didn't want the role and didn't do it. Maybe jones and smith didn't want a woman like Linda Fiorentino to take away their thunder in the sequel as she did in the first movie. Sorry, I just thought I might try to defend Linda since she won't defend herself publicly. She is too cool for that. SHe is happy being a loving aunt, photographer, and living in New York City. I wish her the best. She said that she just doesn't suck up to people like directors like Kevin Smith.",Dogma

But what I absolutely did not see coming was just how funny Jay is in this movie. I've always preferred Silent Bob, but Mewes is a riot. This isn't my favorite of the View Askewniverse. It's long-winded and the incessant conversations on scripture mythology get old. You can tell Kevin Smith was exorcising some self-doubt here, but by the time the gang gets trapped in the bar, I'd mostly checked out.

There was rides on trains and bloody wings being torn off and a merry-go-round of insults and slaps at all faiths. This picture seemed to never end and I clearly do not see why this picture was ever made. Just because I found it horrible, does not stop everyone else from giving it a BIG OLD 10!

22,StevePulaski,Im Faithful in Smith's Dogma,10,15 August 2010,"Kevin Smith not only has the stomach to make such a controversial movie, but he has the power and nerve to make it with a straight face. This movie gave him over 300,000 pieces of hate mail and at least two death threats. Without a doubt his most tender movie and his longest, Dogma is a masterpiece. Its religious satire based film touches on many terms in the Catholic religion and becomes a Fantasy Comedy. Not only is it his longest and most controversial, it's definitely his most confusing. Not being Catholic, I didn't know half the topics they touched so I had to do about an hour of research to finally make sense of this movie. Im not big on religion and feel it's just a way to start and argument just like if you are Republican or Democrat. Who cares what you are? If I was with a friend and we finally touched base on our religion and that killed it because he was Jewish and I was Catholic, Id be pretty angry. Religion causes arguments. Arguments Im not in the mood for. Be whatever you want to be and be it with proud is what I say.Now excuse me for not being a genius in the Religion field, but Im sure that I will make a fatal flaw in this review. Tempted to copy and paste part of the plot from Wikipedia in here, I thought about just giving it a whirl and trying to explain the plot. If any errors are made, just post a comment saying what they are. Ill try my best to explain this, but keep in mind, Im not even old enough to vote so Im trying to explain the rules and laws of Catholics.Two fallen angels named Bartleby and Loki (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) are banished from Heaven and exiled to Wisconsin for the rest of eternity. They notice a church in Red Bank, NJ is having it's centennial anniversary with a plenary indulgence. If they pass through the doors of the church, their sins will be forgiven and sent back to Heaven. But it will overrule God and all existence has we know it will crumble. Meanwhile Metatron (Alan Rickman) acts as The Voice of God and tells Bethany Sloane (Linda Fiorentino), whom works at an abortion clinic to stop Bartleby and Loki from entering the church. She must find the two profits, who happen to be stoners Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and the director Kevin Smith) and the thirteenth apostle, Rufus (Chris Rock) who was left out of the Bible because he was black. They also find the Muse character Serendipity (Salma Hayek) whom has writer's block. All the characters assist Bethany trying to stop Bartleby and Loki. Thats not all. The demon Azrael (Jason Lee) and three hockey playing thugs (The Stygian Triplets) are trying to stop Bethany and her friends. Its all a matter of sacrifice to stop two angels from ruining existence.Dogma is probably the most serious Kevin Smith film ever made. Its extremely well written and the dialogue (which Im obsessed with in every movie of his) is like real people talking in a real situation. It doesn't even feel that they handed them a script. Its like they know the lines they are going to say by heart and the movie doesn't even need a script. There's no fear in any actors, they're all natural and seem to know exactly what to say and not say it like they are eye candy for the camera. Which is the beauty of Kevin Smith movies. Movies with raw dialogue, extremely developed characters, and a brilliant, cutting edge story behind them. Which is what I love best.Still remaining locked and not budging is my favorite movie and has been for the last five years, Clerks. Clerks was the first movie in Smith's career and has probably the best dialogue in the history of film and some of the most well developed and the best characters you can relate your life too, I've ever seen. Not to say other KS movies aren't equally impressive. His second movie Mallrats was panned by everyone, but I have always loved it for it's humor and awarded it four stars, Chasing Amy being very well written and deserving of four as well, this too, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back was the first movie of KS I gave lower than four stars, but just a smudge being rated a three stars by me because at that point I deemed KS at becoming ""too Hollywood"", than came Clerks II which I deemed ""very well done and a worthy sequel"" with a happily three and a half stars to go with it as well.One I didn't mentioned, but reviewed was Vulgar, a dark Comedy mixed with elements of Suspense and revenge was produced by KS, but not directed. I consider it still a KS movie which I thought had great music and a very unique feeling. I awarded it three stars and very favorable review.Dogma didn't seem like my kind of movie, but it was still as beautiful as Clerks and Chasing Amy. Much more plot driven and dialogue heavy than Chasing Amy, Dogma took on a much more deeper story that you had to pay attention to each and every second or you would be lost. Cameo appearances by Clerks actors Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson deem successful in my book as well as George Carlin's appearance being hilarious and well worth it, I rate Dogma the third best movie in the KS series, first one being Clerks, second Chasing Amy, and fourth being Mallrats.Starring: Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Chris Rock, Salma Hayek, Linda Fiorentino, Alan Rickman, and Jason Lee. Directed by: Kevin Smith.",Dogma
23,lasttimeisaw,Deserves its place on my guilty pleasure list.,7,14 May 2015,"A revisit of Kevin Smith's subversive religious comedy DOGMA, ""subversive"" may it seems in a story where God is a woman (played by the one-and-only Alanis Morissette, whose voice can shatter anything into fragments, deservingly to be the choice chanteuse during my adolescence); there is a 13th apostle Rufus (Rock) who has been omitted in the Bible simply because of his skin colour; two fallen angles Loki (Damon) and Bartleby (Affleck) find a loophole induced by a new ""Buddy Christ"" propaganda from Cardinal Glick (Carlin) in New Jersey, they will get the supposed plenary indulgence and re-enter Heaven, until one of them goes berserk becomes a human-killing winged creature. A blasphemy cannot be dodged for sure, but eventually the film appears not as subversive as the synopsis suggests, au fond, Smith simply picks various characters from religious myth and squeeze them into a wacky adventure of fantasy without even badmouthing Catholicism, there should be no hard-feeling (as the opening pointers amusingly noted).So the dogma is ""God is infallible"", two angels' plan will precipitate the undoing of the present human world, thus the last scion of God's bloodline, Bethany (Fiorentino), is a divorcée works in an abortion clinic who is infertile, is informed by Metatron (Rickman) to stop them with the allies of two prophets Jay and Silent Bob (Mewes and Smith himself), the said Rufus and the Muse Serendipity (Hayek), who is trapped in a writer's block and moonlights as a stripper. Also involved is the evil force led by a demon Azrael (Lee) and the Stygian Triplets, not to mention the crass excremental creature Golgothan which Azrael summons.All these modifications and additions are reflecting Smith's geeky upbringing, a bit vulgar nevertheless, but also straightforwardly amusing, and it even becomes more topical as a cultural phenomenon now. Among the motley crew of the cast, Alan Rickman pops out with his noble persona as the second-only-to-God Metatron (in spite of his unconventional look), who is allocated with the forbidding task to materialise in front of the unwitting Bethany, explain the whole absurd scenario convincingly to her and persuade her to fulfil the mission, believe it or not, he actually carries it through wonderfully. Florentino (now completely retired from the screen) discharges a phlegmatic quality contrary of others' comedy-leaning dramatisation and loquacity (bar Silent Bob). Damon and Affleck are quite at ease to play off each other and Hayek is at the crest of her physical beauty whereas Rock is in his own comfortable zone without being too irritating. All in all, any film who has the guts to cast Morissette as the almighty God (even only for a paltry of minutes) deserves its place on my guilty pleasure list.",Dogma
24,KineticSeoul,Cleverly constructed interactions and satires,7,29 May 2014,"This is a cleverly constructed movie with wits to it. I like some Kevin Smith movies, some of them I just don't I however enjoyed this one. I didn't particularly found this movie to hilarious or anything like that, but like I said it does have wits. It might offend certain Christians that take things way to hard, but for others they might find the movie to have close to the right amount of balance to it (what I mean is, it didn't really seem like it tried to step over the line). The cast were all great and each of them brings something to the table. This is more than a journey movie about getting from point A to point B to accomplish a mission. But more so on the interaction between the characters that adds to it's humor and wits. It just seemed like Kevin Smith put a lot of his own thoughts and philosophies about Christianity into this. Which he does in a lot of his movies, excluding the Christianity part. It's a intriguing movie that some Christians may agree with and others will disagree with but most will at least will be intrigued with. It's a movie with cleverly constructed satire that takes on more of the modern street angle to Christianity. This had potential to be better if it had more exploration on intellectual parts and how to expand on that. Even if the overall plot doesn't make much sense when it comes to God. But maybe I am just being a bit nit-picky. Overall this is a movie that the audiences could have a entertaining time with, even the Christian audiences if not taken way too hard. It might offend the Catholics though.7.3/10",Dogma
25,paul2001sw-1,"""Life of Brain-less""",2,9 October 2003,"Kevin Smith's films all have certain distinguishing traits: self-consciously low production values; a lot of swearing; geekly characters; silly jokes; but sometimes perceptive observations.  For 'Dogma', however, Smith has abandoned his normal stomping ground of everyday America to make an attempted religious satire.  The obvious precedent is Monty Python's 'Life of Brian' - but whereas that film was almost entirely about humans (with Jesus simply providing the backdrop), Smith has made a film in which God, and an assortment of angels, are actual characters.  This is audacious, but sadly the execution is poor in the extreme.  With a huge reservoir of source material (the Bible, plus the history of Christianity) to draw on, and a pretty easy target to hit, Smith could surely have taken some central idea to make his point: instead, he picks and chooses from a vast range of starting points, but reduces them all to the most purile of jokes.  The humour in this film appears to be aimed at ten-year-old schoolboys; but aside from its latent unfunniness, it is so far removed from the subject of its mockery that it fails to succeed in mocking at all.  The most ardent anti-Catholic would not base their position on the idea that homesick angels go around shooting people more or less at random: what's offensive about this film is not how much it has to do with religion, but how little.  Even when we get some more serious reflections, they never rise above the level of the mundane: they feel like the observations of a child who thinks that church is boring but who does not yet understand anything about why it the church exists - for good or evil, organised religion is part of the fabric of our society, and without that understanding a film about belief has nothing to say.  Meanwhile, an all star cast largely embarras themselves, while apparently suffering from a contagious bout of Tourette's syndrome. On this evidence, Kevin Smith should stick with the small stuff - when it comes to the big picture, he really has no idea.",Dogma
26,bowmanblue,Irreverent sweary surreal fun (definitely not for everyone),9,1 December 2014,"There are about 800 reasons why you probably won't like Kevin Smith's 1999 offering 'Dogma.' It uses abnormally foul language. It's crude. It's irreverent. It's completely wacky and also part of the 'Askewniverse' (where you basically have to watch Smith's other films to fully appreciate all the gags here). It is definitely an acquired taste.However, if you can overlook the language, the daftness and generally light-hearted mockery of organised religion, Dogma really is something different.For a start it has an all-star cast, not all of which are fully developed, but it's great to see so many talented performers on one cast list. Secondly, it's original. It's safe to say not many films are about a rag-tag bang of religious warriors are trying to stop two exiled angels from returning to heaven in case it destroys the very fabric of the universe. And, finally, it is genuinely funny. The banter - albeit sweary and sexual - is well-written and amusing.Although, you may have to have a reasonably broad sense of humour to fully appreciate this. For, even if you find the banter funny, it is pretty dark. Surprisingly, it does get pretty violent in places.So, if you're looking for some surreal, violent, foul-mouthed, smutty black humour, then this one is for you. Or, just watch any of Kevin Smith's other 'Askewniverse' films. If you like them, you should like this. The Life of Brain it isn't, but it's a different take on the misconceptions created by organised religion.",Dogma
27,dromasca,It Gets Bad When It Gets Serious,8,8 June 2002,"I confess that I do not like angels movies. Neither religious or life after death stuff does not hold enough credibility for me to be material for good movies. However 'Dogma' starts clever enough, it has vivid dialogue, and for much of the time the god acting and the parody line compensates the main moral line of the story. Unfortunately the opportunity for a very good movie is lost when the script seems to take the religious material seriously, and when graphical violence (at the limit of being disgusting) makes its way - probably trying to compensate the too moral line that the story has taken by the last third of the movie. Not even a rather funny twist about how God looks like can save the day, and the film will be mostly remember for some of the funny parodic line but not much more.",Dogma
28,ThomasDrufke,"Get ""Touched"" By an Angel",7,3 August 2019,"With the controversial dialogue that normally flows throughout Kevin Smith's movies, you would think religion may be the one territory he would choose to stay away from. But back in 1999, Smith didn't think twice about it. Now, normally I stay far away from movies with religion as a backbone, but I never once felt like Dogma was trying to force a particular narrative on me. You know exactly what you're getting when you sign up for a movie that contains Matt Damon and Ben Affleck starring as two rogue angels trying to return to Heaven. Yes, it is just as strange as it sounds, but it's more than worth a glance. Did I mention there's a human poop god that attacks characters along the way to saving existence? Or that Jay & Silent Bob are playing two prophets? If you can't get behind that I can't help you.

30,A_Different_Drummer,"Smith's"" Citizen Kane",10,1 December 2013,"Let's start with honesty. If not for this film -- which Smith wrote -- I would be forever perplexed by the attention he gets, for, other than this film, to this reviewer his body of work is not exemplary. But this film is the elephant in the room. This is Smith's ""Citizen Kane"". DOGMA is one of the most unique, entertaining, perplexing, and controversial films ever. And the execution is almost flawless. Take the casting. Damon and Affleck cast just before Damons career took off and Ben's took a nosedive. Serendipity. Linda Fiorentino five full years after everyone in the industry was sure the LAST SEDUCTION was going to launch her into hyperspace. (Never happened. This could be the role of her career). Even the bit parts are astonishing. George Carlin doing a part he was born for, and you can see in his eyes he loved doing it. And Alanis Morissette of all people having the distinction of perhaps being the second person in film history to be cast as GOD - and doing a great job to boot. Want to also point out what I am calling in my other reviews the ""IMDb paradox"" -- the film does not even have a rating of 8 in the database but astonishingly over 1000 people have taken the time and trouble to punch out an opinion...? What's wrong with that picture?

31,CuriosityKilledShawn,Who's your buddy?,4,24 July 2004,"I'll admit it; I have never seen any other Kevin Smith movie aside from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. And even in that movie his lack of class and tendency for cheap vulgarity kind of turns me off him.Despite some moments of (often childish) humor (any bit with Jay and Silent Bob and the cool 'new' Jesus image), Dogma mostly fails on every one of its intentions. Rather than the 'epic' most people are calling this film I consider it to be way overlong and overbearingly self-indulgent.It seems that Kevin Smith has a savage and acidicly cynical view of the Catholic Church and rather than making a movie that unravels any hypocrisies or sheds light on double standards he's made a sprawling shambles that too often goes off in lumbering tangents (one of Smith's constant failings).There's nothing unsubtle or smooth about Dogma. No class or dignity. The dialogue may be considered as biting satire to the casual viewer, but it's actually increasingly tiresome and nothing more than exposition. I kid you not; over 90% of the dialogue in this film is expositional and bores to tears. There's nothing worse than Chris Rock, Linda Fiorentino and Selma Hayek rambling on and on and on with nothing happening and still they go on and on and on and on and on...I cannot believe that there are 100 minutes of deleted scenes from this movie. How on earth the full cut of this movie was tolerated by even the editors is a mystery to me. Proof positive that Kevin Smith has no control over his 'creative' tantrum.There is also the bonus of having the WORST musical score in history (and that includes Harry Manfredini's jarring noises in Jason Goes To Hell). What a horrible, headache-inducing drone it was!The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound, so now you can enjoy that awful score in its full glory on your home theatre. A plethora of extras are, for some reason, included on this DVD. Which is only further proof that the film thinks it's far better than it actually is. There are 'real' good movies that don't get this many extra features on DVD and I assure you I have no intention of knowing more of this film.",Dogma
32,Bored_Dragon,Perfection,10,13 September 2017,"More than a few times I had the misfortune to see and review movies with so many flaws that I gave up on reviewing them because it would end up a novel of epic proportions. But here's one completely opposite. This movie I could praise for hours without danger of being left with no material. I saw it many times and I'll see it many times more. And every time I get excited like the first, cause this movie is simply perfect. Everything from opening credits and font to ending credits is just right. Kevin Smith is, in my opinion, one of the most original and creative writers and directors of our time. The story is perfect, at the same time exciting and relaxing, intelligent and silly, full of positive energy, satire and humour, with genius dialogues. Movie gathers many top actors, musicians and stand-up comedians, and all of them, in spite of relatively low budget, decided to participate in this project with all their hearts and gave amazing performances. List of actors itself is reason enough to see this film. A movie that holds strong messages and depth behind the screen of silly comedy.10/10The movie caused controversy and disapproval because it appears to make fun of faith, but it's just at first glance. Smith himself is a believer and his intention was not to make a mockery of faith, but to use funny approach to bring it closer to younger generations that are repelled by the rigidity of Church, and at the same time to hit negative aspects of Catholic dogma with some good satire. That's why it is important to see this movie without prejudice, so you don't end up caught in a trap of misunderstanding and hating or loving it for wrong reasons.George Carlin, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Linda Fiorentino, Jason Lee, Alan Rickman, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Chris Rock, Salma Hayek, Alanis Morissette",Dogma
33,The-Sarkologist,By far Kevin Smith's best movie,8,6 January 2012,"People have been waiting for this movie ever since the last line in the credits in Clerks said ""Jay and Silent Bob will return in Dogma."" They returned, but in Mallrats and Chasing Amy, before this movie was made. I guess Kevin Smith wanted a few more films under his belt before he tackled a film like this, considering that it is probably his biggest budget film made to date.At the beginning of the movie, he tells people not to take this film too seriously, including the critics, and that God has a sense of humour so instead of calling it down in flames, just enjoy it. Even though, this comment at the beginning did not stop the Catholic Church from petitioning Disney to not release it, and from the film makers receiving lots of hate mail. Kevin Smith wasn't too worried as he then published the letters on the internet.This movie is mainly about belief and the substance of it. I do disagree with his conclusion that faith is malleable and that it doesn't matter what you believe but as long as you believe then it is okay. Personally, just because I believe with my whole heart that the plane I am going to get into will not fall out of the sky, it doesn't mean that the plane won't fall out of the sky. In the end, this is probably the most heretical thing because it deceives us into thinking that we don't have to submit to God's rule and can save ourselves. Personally, if you wanted to be offensive, you should have gone the whole way and said that Jesus is the only way to God.What it does say, which is probably far more offensive to some traditionalists, is that Jesus had a thirteenth disciple that was black, and that Jesus himself was Black. It also suggests that God is a woman, only to say at the end that God in fact has no sex (which I don't necessarily disagree with). Then we had Allanis Morrisette come out, acting all joyful and giggly. He also said that Mary had other children after Christ, and in fact it is highly unlikely that Joseph would not have hung around if he wasn't getting any sex - which I thought was actually quite a cool argument against the Catholic belief that Mary remained a virgin.The movie itself is about two angels who were kicked out of heaven because one got too drunk and convinced the angel of death to give up his job. They then discovered a loophole to get back into heaven, and unfortunately that means that if they do so then God is fallible and thus entire existence vanishes for existence rests on the fact that God is infallible. The reason that the loophole exists is because the Catholics created all of the traditions which God has to hold (not true, and the biblical reference is taken out of context as well), and thus the angels are using this tradition to get back.Even though I do make some criticisms, Kevin Smith does clearly outline at the beginning that this is a movie and that it has been written for a laugh. Even then Kevin Smith does put a lot of ideas into his movies, and from watching them we can see some of the things that he wishes to say. It was true in Clerks and other such movies, and it is the same here.I guess in the end, this movie is a good movie (in fact it is my favourite Kevin Smith movie), but it falls back on some of the practical aspects. Kevin Smith is a brilliant writer, but his directorial skills are not the best. Some suggest that maybe he should stick with being a writer, or maybe work with some other directors, but whatever the suggestion, the truth is that Kevin Smith is very talented, and we hope that this isn't his last movie.",Dogma
34,sol-,The World's End,7,11 November 2016,"When two renegade angels threaten to bring about the end of the world, an agnostic abortion clinic worker is given a divine quest to stop them, something that helps her regain her faith in this energetic Kevin Smith comedy. The plot is a tad too complex with a lot of exposition (and therefore dialogue) required, which provides some pacing issues. The film has a lot of interesting things to say though, and curiously enough, it is not half as sacrilegious as one might expect. Smith actually delivers some positive messages about faith while taking quite a few shots at organised religion and the commercial value that some place on religion - an agenda especially apparent with an absurd new crucifix that the Catholics in the film release to try to attract new parishioners! The film is frequently funny too, though mostly when Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are on screen as the fallen angels. Damon's take on the Angel of Death is especially amusing given his boyish looks. There is a superb sequence in which he intrudes on a board meeting to wreak havoc in the name of divine justice, though his funniest bits come from the baffled reactions of all those around him - in particular, an old lady in a elevator and a gun salesman. Linda Fiorentino is less effective as the abortion clinic worker and fun as it is to have Jay and Silent Bob along for the ride, the 'good' characters here are significantly less enticing than the baddies. 'Dogma' is, however, generally a fun ride with a handful of interesting things to say. The anti-platypus 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' style opening credits are also a treat.",Dogma

Of course, once they do this all of creation will be unmade, but what do they care? No foul, no harm, right? The hero Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) is referred to as the Last Scion.

37,johnnyboyz,"One of the most inconsistent films of all time which tries too hard with its religion knocking and stupid, stupid story.",4,9 September 2007,"Although essentially a comedy; Dogma tries to combine often deep elements of religion, friendship and sacrifice all into one great big pot and then adds some of Kevin Smith's specials (namely his own character creations and his dialogue) in with it for good measure. The upshot of it is that it fails rather spectacularly.The film centres around several characters as they react in their world and try to come to terms with whatever it is their aims are, no matter how feeble. One character just wants to live normally, one angel persists on giving long and confusing speeches in a monotone voice about goals and human kind, two characters that are also angels want to get back into heaven and another two human characters just want to get laid  Wings of Desire this is not. Given the fact I don't follow a religion of any kind, I didn't find the Christianity bashing that offensive but another thing I didn't find it was funny. If having Chris Rock replying ""Yeah, nigga' owes me twenty bucks."" to whether or not he knows God is funny to you then by all means tune in. Dogma also has several occurrences where it is trying to be offensive without reason to. This is evident when Jesus is referred to as actually being black and female, church is boring and the emblem of Jesus being crucified on the cross is 'updated' with Jesus winking and giving the thumbs up sign.Here is why the film is so very inconsistent. The two antagonists of the film are Bartleby and Loki (Affleck and Damon) and oddly enough, they're the most interesting but mostly because they actually do stuff and say funny things; including their own take on how people who break the Ten Commandments should be punished. Having these two angels banished from heaven and attempting to get back in is far more interesting than hanging around with Bethany Sloane (Fiorentino) and her monotone angel friend Metatron (Rickman) who pops up just when you don't want him to ready to give another flat yet encouraging-to-the-hero speech. I feel the reason for this is because not only are the two the better actors in the film but it also feels like they have a goal; something to do whereas Bethany and the gang are just running around trying to find them.Another thing the film lacks in the consistency department is the characters reactions. No matter how bizarre or unreal the situations get, the reactions and faces will always be the same, stone-like expressions. Someone, literally, drops out of the sky (in the worst character introduction of all-time), a 'crap' monster comes out of the toilet and throws human waste around the place, angels appear then transport them across space and time to another location in a flash and yet the characters treat it all like it happens all the time. Inconsistency reigns down again when God is established as a female yet Rufus (Rock) refers to Her as 'He' about five minutes later on board a train and the angels of Loki and Bartleby get their arses kicked by the two stoners Jay and Silent Bob yet are these invincible, all powerful and immortal beings later on in the film which acted as a very drab way of getting the film to its climax.Dogma is a very poorly thought out film that relies on humour that is either of the slapstick or toilet variety and also borrows too many one liners and spoofs from other well known films from the past two decades to enjoy  at times it does feel like a 'Scary Movie'. Jay (Mewes) is as clueless at the end of this film as we are; the only gyp being that we don't get a kiss from Alanis Morissette for our troubles.",Dogma
38,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Great concept, adequate execution, likable movie",6,25 February 2008,"""Dogma"" isn't the kind of comedy that most people will find themselves holding onto their guts during. It's more the second-long ""ha!"" kind of comedy.That simply means Kevin Smith's writing is clever enough to the point where you will be pleasantly shocked by some of the conversations and events of the film and think it all rather amusing and humorous. It's not hilarious, it's just clever and a bit funny.The premise is rather interesting and surprisingly from a more fantasy-esquire genre than Smith traditionally dabbles with. Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) are more or less fallen angels that have found a way back into heaven. They must be stopped or the world will come to a screeching halt, so a seemingly random protagonist named Bethany gets charged by God to stop them. Simple, but the slick, nonchalant approach to religion keeps the satire rampant.The film does spend a lot of its time explaining itself, which isn't too bad considering Smith keeps the explanations to-the-point and allows the characters to stay interesting in the process. Chris Rock, who plays an apostle, and Alan Rickman, who plays God's messenger/ voice are two of these characters that are both good in the film and Smith has allowed to maintain their character's edge despite lines upon lines of explanation.Getting from point A to point B and so on is not the film's strength. The physical events that take place are ultimately boring and unexciting. It's the moments along the way, the conversations and the philosophy that come about, that make it successful. Affleck's character raises a lot of interesting religious questions about humanity and his conversation with the protagonist on the train is rather insightful. In general, Smith has used Bethany as a way to keep the viewers skepticism of the plot active in the film. She keeps it from getting preposterous. In general, the whole cast is very talented and their characters well written, which keeps the film interesting.It's not the funniest or most interesting comedy in terms of plot and the sequence of events, but ""Dogma"" is a smart concept that ultimately results in a sharp satire and some great thoughts that scrutinize religion in a way that never seems too out of line.",Dogma

For those few of us who are neither interested in blunts, New Jersey, or the verbal and sexual abuse of women, Dogma is simply interminable.Perhaps I would find something here to be offended or intrigued by if I were not an atheist.

40,FiendishDramaturgy,Dogmatic but highly amusing,8,16 January 2005,"This work is a very unorthodox and irreverent look at (mainly) catholicism, and other forms of organized religion. Absolutely hilarious, if you have a jaded sense of humor. Frankly, I love this movie! It plays well, even, and intelligently clever throughout. Alan Rickman's performance as the Metatron is most excellent; ironic, dark, and dryly witty. Matt Damon rocks as Loki, and even Ben Affleck contributes a decent characterization. In my opinion, Dogma doesn't deserve the low rating it's received here at IMDb, but that rating does reflect the opinions of a Christian-dominated society. I'm frankly a bit surprised it rates two tenths of a point higher in the US than it does in other countries. Pleasantly surprised.In a society dominated by organized religion, I found this to be a great 90 or so minutes' diversion. True, unadulterated entertainment.It rates a solid 7.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",Dogma
41,freemantle_uk,An intelligently written satirical comedy,10,27 August 2013,"Dogma is one of Kevin Smith's most controversial films, a smartly written comedy that takes jabs against the Catholic Church and religion in general and it is very much a cult classic which my friends from college raved about.Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) is a catholic woman who works in an abortion clinic who is given a mission from Metatron (Alan Rickman), the Voice of God, to go church in New Jersey. She has to stop two fallen angels, Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) who have found a loophole that they can re-enter Heaven: but if they do that they would destroy all of existence because God's word is meant to be infallible. Fortunately (or unfortunately) Bethany is joined by Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), the thirteenth apostle, Rufus (Chris Rock) as Loki goes on a killing spread and a demon called Azreal (Jason Lee) tries to make Loki and Bartleby success in their objective.Dogma is a sharply written comedy that is constantly funny. Smith makes a dialogue driven comedy filled with comical exchanges and great character inactions. Smith's trademarks of film related dialogue and jokes at the expense of Jay, but the best parts is the satire of religion and his showcasing of knowledge of Catholicism, combined with clever lines about the religion.Sometimes Smith does stand on his soapbox about religion, but for the most part the satirical jabs are one target. We get satire from all angles from a Cardinal trying to get the church to appeal to younger worshipper, by doing it in the most patronising way, including a 'hey Jesus' and comic book art for its title 'Catholicism Wow'. There are criticisms about how The Bible has be rewritten to suit certain groups, with the Bible being whitewashed (though ignoring that Jesus and the apostles would have mostly have been of Middle-Eastern appearance) and women having villainous roles.Affleck and Damon were great together as the fallen angels, having great dialogue and discussions, particularly in the beginning and a scene in a boardroom for a children's character. Alan Rickman was also a comedy highlight, playing against type as the Voice of God, someone who has great lines and adds serious emotion depth when needed. He added gravitas and gave the role his all.Kevin Smith has often stated that he thinks he is not a particular good director, but with Dogma he is able to keep a fast pace, he knows how to shoot the dialogue sequences and can add a scene of tension when needed (i.e. the boardroom scene). Smith is competent with the action sequence at the end and he knows how to use his bloodpacks. The general look and tone of the film where Reaper (which Smith directed the pilot) got its influences from.The film does occasional take a misstep, such as Smith being at time very preachy and there is a demon made from faecal matter which was very immature and out of place for a smartly written film.On a final note, Howard Shore of the Lord of the Rings fame provided the score for Dogma and much his other work he gives Dogma a top score. He uses plenty of choir beats and singers to add to the experience.Dogma is a highly enjoyable comedy that is intelligently written and very funny. It is a film deserving of its cult classic status.",Dogma
42,dfranzen70,God God! From Clerks to..Christ?,8,6 May 2000,"This offering from the director of Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy tackles a wide range of religious and social issues, but by no means can one write it off as a self-serious, pretentious epic.   The story tells of two fallen angels, Loki and Bartleby (played by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck), who have been suffering on Earth as immortals for many millenia after their expulsion from Heaven back in the old days. Suddenly, they've found a loophole in celestial logic that will allow them to return home to Heaven - through a church in (where else?) New Jersey. (And if you think entering Heaven through a church in NJ is weird enough, the two have been living all this time in Wisconsin.) While Loki and Bartleby are journeying from Wisconsin to New Jersey, Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) is visited by an angel - the Voice of God, actually - in the middle of the night in her bedroom. Voice (Alan Rickman) informs Bethany that she must journey to New Jersey to stop the angels from re-entering heaven, and that she will be aided in her quest by two prophets, that if the two angels re-enter Heaven, all reality will cease to be, and so on and so forth. Now you or I might be overwhelmed by such an outlandish request, and so is Bethany, but with a little prodding by Voice, she relents. And there's your plot, basically. Both the angels and Bethany are traveling to New Jersey (Red Bank, for those of you in the Garden State), although with different missions. Along the way, each runs into the requisite assortment of oddball characters. One of them is Rufus, the 13th Apostle (who claims he was left out of the Bible because he is black, and that Jesus Himself was black), played to the hilt by Chris Rock. Throw in George Carlin as a cardinal, Salma Hayek as another prophet, and Alanis Morrisette as God (don't worry, she doesn't speak, else your brain would melt and your heart would explode, or something like that), and you have one hell of a fun ride. Don't get me wrong, folks, this isn't a film of whimsey or non-stop mirth, but this is also not a overbearing, pompous, this-is-how-it-happened-and-damn-you-if-you-don't-believe-me kind of movie. In fact, although the closing scene isn't quite as good as the rest of the movie, this is one of the more intelligent films to come out in a while. One reason I feel this way is that there's hardly any plot contrivances - specifically, things tossed into the plot just for the sake of being there, rather than serving a purpose. Everything - and I mean everything - has an explanation. This is a movie that appears to have been pretty well-researched.",Dogma
43,ianlouisiana,In the name of the Mother........,2,19 December 2010,"O.K.,so get this,guys - God is a black woman.""Uh - huh.""Jesus was a cool back dude ""Yo!"",and there was a 13th Apostle,an Eddie Murphy clone called Rufus who was left on the cutting - room floor because the Bible is racist.""Sheeeit!""Oh,and Our Lady works in an abortion clinic. If you think this kind of Undergraduate humour is Fido's wedding tackle then ""Dogma"" will have you rolling in the aisle. It's very much a film for people who think they're too smart to fall for all this ""Religion"" nonsense and consider it very daring to display their contempt by wearing their hair long,or dyed green,or having 5 inch heels on their motor - cycle boots and rings inserted in some strange parts of their anatomy. At Cambridge a few years ago I had to rescue a young man who thought he was making a statement by wearing a T shirt emblazoned with ""Jesus was a ****"" to an inter - college pool game.Such determination to outrage might be considered by some to be admirable. Not by me,though - neither do I find ""Dogma""'s ceaseless assault on what it clearly believes to be the fatuous beliefs of us little people who have,unlike it's makers,no arena to parade our intellectual superiority in. If any of the film's points was daring or innovative I might be less scathing about it,but the idea of a black supreme being has been mooted in the cinema for seventy years,so it's hardly cutting edge comedy or shocking - in fact the concept that an audience might find it funny is quite offensive,possibly even racist. A lot of good actors (and Alan Rickman) spent several weeks of their lives creating this monster,seldom,I would posit,has so much time and talent been wasted. ""Dogma"",in the end,is a film of staggering arrogance,no merit,and demeans its makers. Many people in the real world have only their faith to sustain them. Up there with the Hollywood millionaires that might seem laughable. But from where I'm standing,""Dogma""'s intolerance is the reverse side of the coin of Militant Religion.And there should be no place for that in the name of entertainment.",Dogma
44,dee.reid,"God does have a sense of humor... doesn't She? ""Dogma"" (1999)...",10,28 April 2014,"(I'm not Catholic, nor do I know much about Catholicism, but I am convinced that God does exist, and, and, He/She does have a sense of humor. I mean, She would have to, especially after seeing this movie...)First off, a little bit of history...If I can recall correctly, Kevin Smith's 1999 Christian satire ""Dogma"" was the first movie of his that I ever saw, and was my introduction to the witty New Jersey born & bred Gen-X filmmaker. Over the subsequent years, I came to watch his 1994 debut feature ""Clerks.,"" ""Mallrats"" (1995), ""Chasing Amy"" (1997), ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" (2001), ""Red State"" (2011) and my personal favorite of his, ""Clerks II"" (2006).Smith, who can at best be described as a lax Catholic with a unique perspective of his own faith (that may ruffle a few feathers, i.e., the more devout), threw all these unique perspectives - and then some - into ""Dogma,"" which like every other faith-based movie to ever come out of Hollywood, caught a wrath at the time of its release that can only be described as ""biblical"" in its nature, with the usual protests, boycotts, and calls for Smith's Head on a Silver Platter (you get the point). He would later revisit religion once more with his horror film ""Red State,"" which sought to play up the issue of religious fundamentalism in all its forms (and also, quite literally, I might add, allowed Smith to have the last word on all matters of faith).But even Smith himself knew what he was getting into at the time, and like he clearly states during the opening credits, even God Herself has a sense of humor, i.e., why wouldn't She smite Smith down where he stood behind the camera by allowing the late comedian George Carlin (an avowed atheist) to play a New Jersey-based Catholic priest in the film? ""Dogma"" centers around the two fallen angels Bartleby (Smith regular Ben Affleck) & Loki (Matt Damon, another star-powered Smith regular), who hope to get back into Heaven by exploiting a newly discovered loophole in Catholic dogma.So what? Two angels banished to Wisconsin want to get back into Heaven? Big deal, right?Wrong.To do so, would be to eventually reverse a divine decree that the pair never be allowed to re-enter Heaven (and when the Apocalypse comes, they have to sit outside the Gates for the rest of eternity - zing!!!). This would essentially prove God wrong and because God is infallible, this would thus lead to the complete undoing of all of existence (the end of the world, again, remember). To do this, the Seraphim Metatron/The Voice of God (Alan Rickman) is dispatched to Earth to recruit Bethany Sloane/The Last Scion (Linda Fiorentino), an abortion clinic worker (double-zing!!!), to go to New Jersey and stop Bartleby & Loki from re-entering Heaven (a Catholic church - triple-zing!!!).And of course, Bethany has plenty of help. So, aiding Bethany in her God-given mission also are Metatron; two prophets - and stoner slackers - Jay (Jason Mewes) & Silent Bob (Smith himself); Rufus (Chris Rock), the so-called ""thirteenth apostle""; and the super-sexy Earth-bound muse Serendipity (the super-sexy Salma Hayek).""Dogma"" is not a movie for the faint-of-heart (or the most easily offended, i.e., the ones who probably need to see this movie the most but obviously won't), like most Smith movies are. It's got much of his usual down & dirty (yet witty) dialogue and post-Gen-X attitude, but it's also got heart and plenty of clever insights into some of the problems surrounding organized religion, Christianity (and Catholicism), in particular. Smith probably knows better than anyone that religion itself is not perfect, and he's not afraid to ask important questions that could lead to constructive debate about the problems inherent in faith and come up with solutions to try to fix them, rather than just continue to follow religious dogma blindly. It must be reiterated that in other words, Kevin Smith is not hating on religion; his lax faith is just as important to him as it is to anyone else; he knows it's not perfect and can just see the humor in it all.""Dogma"" is perhaps Kevin Smith's most mainstream feature - and his most controversial, however needlessly so. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are what hold this feature down; although they're the bad guys here who realize their selfish actions could cause mankind to instantaneously cease to exist, we get to see that they are indeed two complex characters who can be sympathized with, though to a degree. Smith clearly wrote these two with quite a bit of care and affection (in fact, all the characters in Smith's movies can be said to have been written with plenty of care, affection, and heart). Linda Fiorentino (who was allegedly cited by Smith to be quite difficult to work with) is this story's emotional anchor and the one we forge the strongest connection with. Like Jesus Christ Himself (this connection becomes clearer two-thirds of the way through the picture), she's carrying quite a significant burden on her delicate shoulders to save the world. It's a lot of quality acting on her part, however problematic she may have been for Smith behind the scenes.It's been quite a while since I last ""Dogma."" I was only 14 when this movie was released and even then I just saw the humor and vulgarity that is typical of much of Smith's work. Having seen it again today for the first time in ages and with much clearer eyes, I can say that this is perhaps his heaviest piece of cinema, and was equally embraced and judged by people on both sides - like any quality piece of art.As it stands, my top-four Kevin Smith movies are ""Clerks II,"" ""Chasing Amy,"" ""Clerks.,"" and ""Dogma.""10/10",Dogma
45,drqshadow-reviews,Ripe Material for Satire is Often Too Quirky and Scripted,5,30 January 2012,"Kevin Smith's unflinching onslaught upon organized religion that masks its intentions under the guise of an over-indulgent, goofy stoner road trip. Although he's chewing on some very thick meat in this one, a weighty, opinionated take on a touchy subject isn't quite enough to compensate for the sheer volume of quirks and trademarks the writer/director once again puts up on display. Every on-screen character speaks in long, unbroken monologues; basically mouthpieces for Smith himself. Jay and Silent Bob, the inessential links to Smith's earlier films, feel shoehorned into a plot that would've worked just as well (if not better) without them. Punchlines are virtually spelled out along the bottom of the screen, or glaringly in the backgrounds. It's a pity, because the film does have some valid points about the shortcomings of organized religion and the evolution of spirituality - particularly Catholicism - but amidst so much sinewy excess that central message is nearly clouded beyond interpretation. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, still fresh from the success of Good Will Hunting, turn in strong performances as ignorant fallen angels but ultimately find little else to work with.",Dogma

47,MaxBorg89,"Quite amusing, even if it isn't Kevin Smith's Life of Brian",8,30 October 2006,"Kevin Smith's fourth feature film made some people upset because it made fun of Catholicism. Personally, I think the impact of certain ""revelations"" (e.g. a thirteenth apostle was left out of the Bible for being black) are lessened by the opening disclaimer stating the movie shouldn't be taken seriously. I followed that advice, and liked the movie.So, what's this all about? There are two angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) who have been exiled from Heaven (""They were sent to Hell?"" ""Worse. Wisconsin""). After thousands of years, they learn there might be a way to return home: if they enter a church in New Jersey, all their sins will be canceled, allowing them to get back to Paradise. Naturally, there's a catch: should they succeed, all existence will be wiped out. And with God mysteriously absent, someone else has to stop them. Enter Bethany Sloane (Linda Fiorentino), a woman who has lost her faith and is given the vital mission by another angel, Metatron (Alan Rickman). Of course, given she's only human, she'll receive some help, in the shape of Rufus (Chris Rock), the aforementioned thirteenth apostle, the muse Serendipity (Salma Hayek) and two ""prophets""... Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith)! With allies like these, how can she possibly fail? As always with Smith, much of the pleasure derives from the writing: the witty, often potty-mouthed dialogue is the usual aural joy. He mocks everything and everyone, particularly John Hughes (apparently, Home Alone became successful because some nut sold his soul to Satan), without ever making it feel offensive.So why isn't Dogma as hilarious as Clerks? Well, the answer lies in the cast: while Affleck and Damon are fun as the angels, Fiorentino is a convincing lead, and Jay & Silent Bob are scene-stealing alongside Rock, other actors aren't as funny. In particular, Jason Lee, otherwise terrific, doesn't get a chance to really shine as demon Azrael, and Rickman's performance is a bit too British to fit in Smith's crazy View Askewniverse.Still, if you're looking for a good laugh, Dogma is recommended. Smith has done better, but the movie is very enjoyable anyway. If not taken seriously, it might even please devout Catholics. Who knows?",Dogma
48,drystyx,Drawing board failure,3,4 August 2012,"""Dogma"" is one of those movies that looks like it was thought up by drunks in a bar, and written on tape recorders by the same drunks.The comedy just isn't there. It is supposed to have a plot about angels, but a viewer can't tell this without looking at the marque and scenario.The actors are not natural comics. They struggle to show some dry comic wit with what could be every day conversations, or at least people at work ""fooling"" with each other.These ""fooling"" gibes work with friends, because friends are already doing something they like to do, or have a rapport.We've probably all seen ""friends"" who had no natural writing talent, expound upon ideas just like this. Savvy folks see through it.The problem is threefold with this movie.First, the initial idea. It's a drawing board failure. It's the idea that can be mildly humorous for five seconds when two friends come up with the idea. It doesn't translate well into performance, as we see here.Second, the writing just doesn't inspire. It tries to be too mundane, and induce laughter with the ordinary. Some writers can do this. We don't have such writers for this script.Third, you need some raw comic talent in performers. These look like acting school students, trying to be funny. They just don't have it.And yet, while it has no value as comedy, it appears there is a fan club. The obvious conclusion is that this hits the ""ordinary talentless person"" in their gut, and lets such a person be part of an ordinary world.So I attribute the success to being ""ordinary"", something that the high school dropouts, painters, roofers, rich kids with cameras, and pot heads can relate to, something that tells them it is okay to be without talent.Obviously, this isn't a funny movie, but the heart is in the right place.",Dogma

50,Jonny_Numb,thank the heavens it's subversive!,7,1 August 2003,"Amid ""Dogma""'s considerable amount of flaws, the major one is that it seems too ambitious for its own good--Kevin Smith wants to lay into every aspect of organized religion from every angle at once that the movie sometimes threatens sensory overload.  I suppose that's not a flaw, though--moviegoers like myself should be thankful for this type of ambition within the cookie-cutter mass market.  Taking a cue from Monty Python's ""Life of Brian"" and mixing it up with low-budget cheese, Smith delivers a sometimes-scathing, sometimes-hilarious, but always inconsistent fable about a woman (Linda Fiorentino), whose lack of faith pegs her to save the world from two rowdy fallen angels (the deliciously vulgar duo of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon).

However, they are unwitting pawns in a plot by a sneaky demon called Azrael to destroy mankind, having first distracted God's attention. Bethany is a lapsed Catholic who turns out to be a blood descendant of Christ, and is recruited by God's staff to prevent the apocalypse, along with the help of an unknown Black Apostle, a Muse who works as an erotic dancer and a couple of stoners called Jay and Silent Bob. Can the forces of Heaven overcome this terrible threat ?Dogma is a fabulous movie; hilarious, thought-provoking, very well acted and terrific fun throughout - what other film juxtaposes scenes of profound metaphysical argument on the nature of religion with a monster made out of excrement breaking up a strip joint ? There really isn't anything to compare this movie with (the only film that's even remotely similar is Gregory Widen's The Prophecy), although it has several links and shared actors/characters with Smith's other View Askew movies. It's a terrific mish-mash of ideas, a great riff on religious mythology, a touching story of a women overcoming a heartbreaking tragedy in her life, an easy-going road movie and a thoroughly cracked comedy. Every character is fascinating and all the performances are wonderful, particularly Lee, Hayek, Rickman and the writer-director as the lovable Silent Bob, and Morissette makes for one of cinema's most original depictions of God. Although it's extremely well made, the quality really comes through in the writing, which is both imaginative and vulgar in equal measures. These characters may happen to exist on a different plane of existence, but they still suffer from all-too-human neuroses and foibles. Fiorentino, who specialises in laid-back pragmatists, is an unusual choice for the bewildered heroine, but her reliable performance makes the wackier ones all the more funny as she fights off disbelief, denial, incomprehension, sexual advances and the end of Creation.

53,Spleen,"Hey, Smith - GET A COLLABORATOR",5,6 August 2000,"Ya know, the basic idea isn't bad.  Well, one of them.  ""Let's make an ENTIRE MOVIE out of Jay and Silent Bob"" is a stupid idea; and, for a fact, we see too much of those two.  But the kind of fantasy Smith has spun out of Catholic dogma, and Catholica generally, is nice.  A writer on this site says it reminds him of Chesterton.  Ye-es, kind of, I can more or less see that, although Chesterton would never have dared to write so much as a sentence that might be interpreted by anyone as being critical of the Catholic Church; by the end of his life he was probably incapable of even forming such a thought.  Smith mixes reverence with revisionism in much the same way that writers of latter-day Sherlock Holmes pastiches do.  This is ""Without a Clue"", except that it's based on Catholica, rather than the Holmes stories.  Is it, then, a good movie?  No.  Is it, at least, a good script, ruined by Smith's flat-footed direction?  No.""Chasing Amy"" might with justice have been named ""Talking Almost Incessantly About Amy"", but even so I had no problem with the writing.  Too much talk? Yeah, perhaps, but at least it felt unforced - men and women really do deliver speeches to one another of that sort -; and the speeches weren't badly written, apart from the fact that they tended to go on for too long. But it looks as if word got around to Smith that ""Chasing Amy"" was too talky.  So he took one look at his even talkier ""Dogma"" script, and said: ""I know - I'll break the monologue up into dialogue""; and the result is MUCH more stilted, with characters, poor Linda Fiorentino's in particular, reduced to the status of foils with lines like, ""Yes, Socrates"", ""It cannot be otherwise, Socrates"", and, if they're lucky, ""How so, Socrates?""  This by no means exhausts what's wrong with the script.  Humour is too thinly spread and not quite right - wan, somehow - when it appears.  Even Smith's vivid passion for popular art has been bleached away to a pale stain.  And I can't avoid having the impression - not that THIS exhausts what's wrong with the script, either - that Smith was too timid with the religious institutions he's ostensibly criticising.  If even THIS mild rebuke to the Catholic Church, buried under layers of pro-Christian propaganda, is enough to incite mass protests and virulent hatred ... you have to wonder, just what religious-inspired art WOULD bishops find acceptable?  The Father Brown stories?  ""Going My Way""?  Anything else?This reminds me: there's a scene in which Loki kills the board of the directors of the Mooby Corporation (Disney, thinly disguised).  (Boy, was THAT joke laboured.)  I guess I'd better come to the defence of Disney here, if no-one else will: the scene was offensive.  The implication was that nine-tenths of Disney's management consists of sex offenders of one kind or another who deserve to die; but secular organisations, and secular beliefs, are fair game - and so, I suppose, they should be, but I wish that the Catholic Church realised it has no more right to be shielded from criticism, or offensive comment, than Disney does.It's all a pity, because although I'm not in love with Salma Hayek, she's gorgeous, and I'd like to be.  But someone has placed a curse on her. Perhaps one day it will be broken, and she'll appear in a good movie.P.S.:  Since I've mentioned ""Without a Clue"" I should also mention that it's a comic gem.",Dogma

What I disagreed with and found the most repulsive was the childish humor aimed at Jesus, God Himself and the apostles. The Bible is not a relative book which every person may interpret the way he likes. The Bible is the Word Of God, and that is that. Smith is a kind of a Buddhist with his relativism. This is not great. And he chose the wrong topic to mock at. God is not a senile geezer, He is the Lord. This film is Not recommended.",Dogma
59,sme_no_densetsu,One of Kevin Smith's most interesting movies (even though he plays it kind of safe),8,20 June 2015,"""Dogma"" is the sort of movie that major studios rarely take a chance on. Poking fun at religion often ends up drawing the wrong kind of publicity. However, back in 1999, Kevin Smith had enough clout to assemble an impressive cast to bring to life this irreverent comedy/fantasy adventure.The story concerns a couple of fallen angels (Matt Damon & Ben Affleck) who discover a loophole that'll allow them to re-enter Heaven. Little do they know that this comes with the unfortunate side effect of negating existence as we know it. Luckily for us, forces for good (including an angel, a muse and the 13th apostle) have enlisted the aid of some unlikely heroes in a quest to save mankind.The cast of ""Dogma"" is more star-studded than most of Kevin Smith's movies. Buddies Damon & Affleck were among Hollywood's top young stars at the time, so getting them involved was something of a coup. However, the story was expansive enough that there was plenty of opportunity for others to shine as well. Linda Fiorentino plays the story's central character while Alan Rickman, Chris Rock & Salma Hayek offer divine assistance. George Carlin also makes a memorable appearance as a cardinal aiming to reinvigorate the Catholic church. Alumni from past Kevin Smith movies include Jason Lee, Jason Mewes, Smith himself and, in smaller roles, Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson & Ethan Suplee.Smith's script features his usual knack for dialogue and pop culture references but, to me, it seems to be a bit heavy on exposition at times. That being said, having seen the many deleted/extended scenes, it's clear that considerable effort was put into cutting the movie down to a reasonable length. Meanwhile, Smith's direction is consistently well handled and the special effects are decent enough for this relatively low budget production. Musically, there are a few memorable moments but mostly the focus is elsewhere.All in all, ""Dogma"" is an interesting and original movie, though perhaps lacking a bit in satiric bite. On the other hand, the light tone is probably for the best since it makes the movie less offensive than it could have been. I don't know if Smith really has much to say in the end but it does make for an entertaining couple of hours.",Dogma
60,Howlin Wolf,Would have worked better in another medium.,6,4 March 2001,"Make no mistake, Smith can write dialogue.  When he does it to best effect (personal fave: ""Mallrats"") the results are hilarious.  I just don't think he's a great director, and with a theme this big it could really have done with some skillful interlinking by another director.  (I noticed Martin Scorsese was given thanks at the end of the picture, wouldn't that combo of writer and director have been interesting...?)   Also, his dialogue here served as exposition far too often.  That's why I say it would have worked better in another medium.  '""Dogma"": The Book' anyone?  Another film that had a similar problem was Denzel Washington starrer ""The Siege"".   (SPOILERS)   Despite these fairly serious flaws, I still gave ""Dogma"" a '6' for being what I would class an 'honorable failure'.  Smith did assemble a great cast, and come up with one or two hilarious moments (The 'Buddy Christ' was just classic...!)  Although not particularly religious myself, I believe that Smith is a Catholic, so I'm sure he had no wish to be mean-spirited about any kind of faith.  If you see the movie and find it offensive, fair enough, but what I can't understand is those Bishops criticising the film when they haven't seen it.  At least have the decency to pass an educated judgement on a product guys!   Also, any movie that has the guts to cast Alanis Morisette as 'God' has definitely succeeded on some level!",Dogma
61,oneguyrambling,"Part religious, part blasphemous, mostly hilarious.",8,27 December 2011,"In Kevin Smith's world there are Angels among us, they blaspheme, kill and covet – by my reckoning three of the Big Ten – perhaps Kevin thought 7 outta 10 ain't bad? They also look like the guys from Good Will Hunting! These two angels, Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) were cast from Heaven for things un-Angel-ly, though they believe they have discovered a loophole that will allow them access back to heaven, and they have 4 days to get to New Jersey to exploit it.The problem there is that existence itself is based upon the principle that God is infallible, and proving him wrong in any way disproves that, meaning existence itself won't exist.So every man and his Dog(ma) from both ""sides"" (you know up above and down below) are intent to either allow these two misguided Angels passage in order to create chaos or prevent them from f*cking up the nice gig we humans have down here.The finer points of the plot don't matter here – suffice to say that the Church trying to get hipper and more accessible is a factor – what really drives the film is that the theological backdrop provides Kevin Smith's many characters with a setting where his dialogue sounds more plausible, even with all the unnecessary and extraneous formal touches that no-one aside from he and his characters use in everyday life. But Angels, Demons and Apostles probably do (not sure if I need capitals there but I'd hate to p*ss off the Church!).With the big G-(wo)Man being laid up and unable to step in it is up to his staff to prevent this unholy act.Bethanie (Linda Fiorentino) is the initially unwilling human charged with the ultimate responsibility by the Metatron AKA voice of God (Alan Rickman), Rufus is the formerly unknown 13th Apostle (who proves his authenticity by stating that Jesus ""still owes me twelve bucks!""), and Smith faves Jay and Silent Bob are essentially escorts along for the rise – and to provide much of the potty humour.On the ""Red"" team are Azrael the demon (Jason Lee) and a few teenaged minions.The ludicrous and way out setting is perfect for Kevin Smith to work with, being a pet project he obviously spent a great deal of time coming up with a plot that while far-fetched hangs together and is plausible in an impossible way. The script is often clever, the dialogue better than anything he has written since and there is lots of detail along the way that shows the time spend fine tuning the small things.But with the good comes the not so good – though Smith thankfully keeps his indulgences minor – there are still various comic book references, a myriad of 80s references and wink-wink cameos, but it must be said they do all work or at least not detract from the good stuff.And finally what other film can say that they have Salma Hayek as a stripper (I could give you 20 paragraphs on that 90 second scene alone!), a Sh*t-Demon, and who could forget the mass murder of fast food chain senior management topped off with the slaughter of hundreds of New Jersey-ites? (Unfortunately this was made before Jersey Shore so they weren't able to kill off the unbearably untalented Snooki – that might be a job for a Terminator in the future.) I think Clerks remains Kevin Smith's best film and Chasing Amy is his most accomplished, but I wouldn't be surprised if this was the film he was most satisfied with, after all he managed to tick most of the ""Kevin Smith Bingo TM"" categories off (potty humour, 80s references, cameos, a cast of his familiars, drug references, Jay and Silent Bob, comic book parables etc) AND deal with his own religious questions at the same time, in a film that works quite well as a straight comedy – albeit of the dreaded controversial type – but even without the dick jokes (or lack thereof where Angels are concerned) the script is interesting enough that Dogma would be worth watching.Of course if you are reading this and want me to address the film from a religious perspective – you're wasting your time. It's just a movie, a good movie dealing with religious themes, but still JUST A MOVIE! Final Rating – 8 / 10. Smith should go back to writing his own stuff about things that matter to him, anything else could be perceived as a Cop Out, which wouldn't be good.",Dogma
62,lambiepie-2,"One of my ""Guilty Pleasures"" Movies",10,12 December 2002,"For the really religious and easily offended, this film will not sit well. For those of us who have a sense of humor about ""it all"", then this is a very funny film. It breaks every rule in religion there is, and does so by poking fun at history. I was laughing my tail off at George Carlin's role, it set the tone for the film. Basically two fallen angels (Affleck and Damon) find a way to get back into heaven via a gateway on a specific day. To stop these two, a former devout church goer now divorce, Bethany who has all but given up on the church finds out she is one of the only people to stop them and thus begins a wacky adventure with Bethnay, Rufus, the 13 Apostle and Jay and Silent Bob as two modern day Prophets. This is my guilty pleasure film, I think its funny, but deep down it has good intentions. Don't take it too seriously and you may find yourself laughing ""here"" and ""there"" throughout the film... just when you don't think you should.",Dogma
63,baumer,Kevin Smith is a genius,9,14 November 1999,"Warning: does contain spoilersI was completely blown away by Clerks, Mallrats was good but a bit of a disappointment and Chasing Amy is one of the most honest films I have ever seen.  Dogma is one of the most intelligent and daring and it is incredibly funny and very, very entertaining.  Dogma is a triumph and I am glad there are guys like Smith who have the brains to make a film like this.One of the great strenghts of this film is the witty references to 80's films and films in general.  And to quickly rebut what a previous reviewer commented about Smith's small speaking role, yes I agree that he had nothing witty to say in this film but the two lines that he did have were great, especially when he tosses somebody out of the train and he says to a frightened passenger "" NO TICKET "" as he points out the window.  That is one of the funniest parts of the movie as it parodies or pays homage to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.  So to say that his lines are stupid in this film is to not be paying attention to what he is saying and where those lines of dialogue come from.  There are also some great lines about John Hughes' fictitious city of Shermer Illinois and of a debate about what was going to be the bigger film, E.T. or some other small movie that disappeared faster than Tom Selleck's film Ffolks.  Kevin Smith's wit and knowledge of film is on par with Tarantino and Kevin Williams and he is to be applauded for that.This film is very wordy and I can see how some people would think that it takes away from the film's enjoyment, I feel the opposite.  Kevin Smith's strength has been always been his mind and what he writes.  His directing skills are average at best, after all, he has no training with the camera. He only films what he knows how to.  But it is his script that has been the best part of all of his films.  To  say that this film is too wordy is to critisize Smith for doing what he does best, and that is writing witty and smart dialogue for us.  He is obviously very well versed in Catholisism and other religions and he gets it out on paper for all of us to love and laugh at.  I really enjoyed everything that he had to say about religion.  But now to get to what I think the best part of the film is, and that is to look no further than the two male leads.Damon and Affleck are priceless in here.  They work so well together and they feed off of one another.  Affleck has been in all of Smith's films except Clerks and Damon and Smith also go way back as he too had a small cameo in Chasing Amy.  Friendship probably got them to look at the script, but the strength of the script probably got them to do it, and for that I am thankful.  Damon and Affleck work the screen like a pianist works the keys. A perfect example of this (and my favourite part of the script and the film) is when they are at the movie studio and they are patronizing the execs for breaking the ten commandments.  Your eyes are glued to the screen when Damon lays into each and every one of them and even Affleck with his subtle nods and expressions of exasperation are perfect.  I am really pleased that these two played Bartleby and Loki.  Their friendship in real life really helped define their friendship in the film.Dogma is an intelligent film about religion, it is gut bustingly funny in many parts, it has a wonderful cast that play their parts beautifully and it is a Kevin Smith film.  I love it.  This film, while witty and smart, is really one of the funnier films to come out this year.  What's not to like about it?  Thanks Kevin Smith for being loyal to your fans and friends and making this movie and the three others before it.  You really are a genius and I look forward to your next film, whatever that may be.",Dogma
64,baumer,why is religion not open to poke fun at just like any other topic?,9,4 August 1999,"You know, I am so sick and tired of religious loonies who think that religion and God are untouchable subjects when it comes to satire.  Why is it that almost anything in the world is open for critisism and poking fun at yet religion and moreso Catholisism is the Holy Grail and people get offended and try to ban the film because it doesn't conform to what YOU believe is right.  Whatever happened to free speech?  Is it that they are afraid that Catholics are going to watch this film and change their minds and become atheists?  Is it because they don't have a sense of humour?  Isit because religion has just a little too much power?  And further more, is it because Catholisism has just a wee bit too much power.  If you look at life, and you subscribe to the theory that everything you see is God's creation, then you have assume that God has a sense of humour, and if that is true He would be looking down on all the uptight Catholics and religious types and laughing His butt off when it comes to all the controversy that has been generated by this film.  Really, what is it that is so offensive about a film that pokes fun at religion?  I am like the previous reviewer and have not seen the film, but I have read it, and you know what?  I think it is hysterical.  A complete laugh riot.  And here's the kicker.  I believe in God, I've read the Bible cover to cover twice and I do fear the Almighty. But does that mean that everything that is ever said about Him ( or Her in this case) has to be "" Praise the Almighty, God you are king and blah balh blah? ""  Do religious fanatics not realize that many people have a problem with organized religion and that a film like this is really quite funny and not only acceptable but appropriate?  The people that critisize this film are the same people that say Santa Clause is a bad influence on children. My Gosh, have a sense of humour.Dogma made me laugh.  I read the script in one afternoon and when Rufus shows up I laughed so hard that I almost choked on my Diet Coke that I was sipping on at the time.  The script is so visually perceptive that I could see everything that is happening.  And not only is the film hilarious, but it is smart.  It is written by a guy ( Smith ) that obviously has issues about religion but he respects it in some way, perhaps like me.  But he has told a story about normal people and people that we will probably never meet in our life time.  It is the story of a girl that is down on her luck and she questions God and His/Her intentions towards her ( haven't we all done that? ).  It also has two angels in it that have fallen out of God's grace by basically doing what they thought was right and then finding out that they misinterpreted what God wanted.  And then it of course has Jay and Silent Bob.  They are still two idiots that save the day here.  And so what the film does is pokes fun at religion, but if you can read, not just what you want to see but everything that is in the script, then you will see that this film has a lot more to say about Catholisism and religion than just bad stuff.  There are a lot of positive comments in the script, but people that consider religion to be off limits when it comes to satire are too blind to see those comments.  All they want to see is the stuff that seems to say religion is wrong.  And you know what, it doesn't say that.  Open your eyes.Most people that I know are confused about religion.  All we have to go on is what is written in a book.  That's it.  There is no concrete proof that anything written in the Bible is real.  But what everyone goes on is faith. Faith says Jesus died for our sins.  Faith says that the ten commandments were written.  Faith says that Moses parted the red sea.  There are no fossils to say that Noah really landed on top of that mountain.  There is no museum with irrefutable proof that says God was alive at one point, in the flesh that is.  So if all that religion has going for it is faith, then why is it afraid when someone makes something that goes against that faith? If you are as strong as your religion makes you out to be, then you really should have nothing to worry about.  Why not just quit your bitching and go see this movie for what it is?  And that is a funny look at someone's educated satirical look at one part of religion.  Just relax.  Don't be so damn defensive.  To me, that shows a lack of your own faith.  Kind of contradicts your whole point now, doesn't it?If you want to read this script, go to script-o-rama.com  You will find the script there.

67,Beta_Gallinger,"A controversial but very funny Kevin Smith film, definitely not boring",8,28 January 2010,"When I rented this fourth theatrical Kevin Smith movie (preceded in the 90's by ""Clerks"", ""Mallrats"", and ""Chasing Amy"") just last week, it had been nearly two years since I had last watched anything from raunchy comedy filmmaker Kevin Smith, but for a long time, I had known about its controversial content and that many Catholics disapproved of it. I was totally unaware of this film's existence back when it was released in late 1999 (I didn't see anything from Smith until 2005) and the Catholic protests it caused during its theatrical run, but I had learned about this by the time I finally saw it. Since I had previously seen Smith's first three films and they had all made me laugh, I expected ""Dogma"" to do the same, and it did.Bartleby and Loki are two angels who have been banished from heaven and sent to Wisconsin, but they find a way they can get back in. A Catholic church in Red Bank, New Jersey is celebrating its Jubilee. If the two exiled angels pass through the archway of this church, their sins will be forgiven, and they will be able to get back into heaven once they die. However, if they do this, they will overrule the word of God and end all existence! Metatron, a messenger from God, summons an abortion clinic worker named Bethany Sloane to stop Bartleby and Loki from getting through the archway, but at first, he is not clear on why she has been chosen for this mission. On Bethany's trip to New Jersey, she is accompanied by two silly ""prophets,"" Jay and Silent Bob, and the three of them are soon joined by Rufus, the thirteenth apostle, who is not mentioned in the Bible. Meanwhile, the demon Azrael is working against these four, determined to make sure the exiled angels DO make it to the church and put an end to existence! The beginning here doesn't look very promising, with the Stygian Triplets assaulting an elderly man with hockey sticks, but after that, it soon gets pretty funny, with the conversation between Loki and a nun, the conversation between Loki and Bartleby that follows, etc. At this point, the film is still not as funny as it's going to get. It starts to get REALLY funny when Alan Rickman makes his first appearance as Metatron, in Bethany's bedroom. Rickman is excellent here, playing a comically irritable character! After that, Kevin Smith's two recurring characters, Jay and Silent Bob, help keep the humour consistent for a long time, Jay with his sex-crazed tendencies (constantly wanting to have sex with Bethany and getting on her nerves), and Silent Bob (played by Smith himself) with some of his body language. Chris Rock plays Rufus, and he also contributes to the laughter. The cast is generally impressive. I didn't care much for some of the jokes, including Rufus telling Bethany something he knows about her past, but they are way more good gags than lame ones. This includes what Rufus says right after that, about Jay and his masturbation! Eventually, the humour dies down, but the plot still drives the film after this and keeps viewers watching.This fourth feature film from Kevin Smith has a lot you can usually expect from the filmmaker, including a lot of juvenile toilet humour, swearing, and not much sex, but lots of explicit sex TALK. However, ""Dogma"" is also a work of religious satire, and this has inevitably offended many people, who would consider the movie blasphemous. The film can be and has been interpreted in many different ways. However, the fact that it made me laugh so much has nothing to do with my religious views. The same goes for Monty Python's ""Life of Brian"", a popular comedy film which was released twenty years before this one and caused the same kind of controversy. Both films have made me laugh because I've found them so funny (duh). Smith's style of humour is obviously hated by many, and I'm sure a lot of these people think that anyone who likes it mustn't have any taste, but for his fans who can take the irreverence of this fourth flick of his, I think it's worth watching. I don't know what to say about the messages of the film, and exactly what they are, but because of the humour and plot, I have to give it a high rating.",Dogma
68,Stampsfightclub,Hugely controversial fantasy that is as dark as it is funny,9,12 May 2009,"Catholic Bethany (Fiorentino) is sent on a mission to stop two angels getting through a church in New Jersey that will destroy reality.Of all the controversial issues to portray in cinema, it is more than likely that religion in any form of beliefs will be one that raises many eyebrows. Over the last decade there has been uproar from the widely acclaimed The Passion of Christ to the mystery adventure Indiana Jones and the last crusade, all depicting the tales of Jesus. But when a comic concept is thrust inside such a delicate topic, it blows the other films out of proportion, as this 1999 heavily debated picture does.Whatever your beliefs, should you turn on Dogma and be offended by the opening statements about the Platypus, you will continue watching as the sheer concept of this film cannot be ignored. The depiction of tales from the Bible, heavenly creatures and perhaps the most controversial, the race and sexuality of God is all conveyed in a humorous manner. And it is a complete black comedy, the slickness writing by Kevin Smith ensures of that. With the baffling physical humour and complete ease at which the jokes flow makes the controversy of Indy look like an afternoon school session.In an attempt to be light-hearted towards its encoded ideologies, the opening statements suggest the viewer doesn't take the film seriously, which is simply way over your head. There is no question this is a funny film, it is simply tongue in cheek consistently from start to finish but with such a debatable core centre about stopping angels and the concept of religion it has such a passionate core that you will enjoy whilst almost being educated in light heartedness, though the tales told are questionable.With such a hard written script and such an ease in which it depicts the tale of Christianity, it is almost easy to forget this has some of the finest actors in the world.Affleck and Damon team up once again to make a funny pairing of Angels that goes from bad to worse to down right shocking. Fiorentino is as cold as usual where Rickman spices up his sarcasm in the messenger role. Chris Rock brings some dark controversial humour to his role likewise. Jason Mews and Kevin Smith also make a funny pairing who would later go on to make a sequel to this, which for me, is a must avoid. This is simply too unique to be ruined by sequels or spin offs.Dogma is widely controversial but unforgiving with its dark and outrageous humour that will have you laughing and debating for a long time afterwards.",Dogma
69,CharltonBoy,This dragged on a bit too much for me.,6,25 February 2002,"Dogma is an interesting concept that has it moments but it dragged on far too long for me which spoilt it. It is the story of two fallen angels who try in their own way to get back into heaven after being banished by god. Now the concept of a movie that makes fun of religion to me is a great thing (look at Monty Pythons life of Brian, a Classic) although i dont think that was the general idea. but in this film there are some great soundbites about organised religion such as: ""Trust the catholics to destroy existance,I have a problem with anyone who treats god as a burden instead of a blessing like some catholics , you people dont celebrate your faith you mourn it!"""" People dont go to church to feel spiritual anymore they go to church to feel bored but people keep going every week just out of habit""In my opinion these comment could be said for any organised religion not just catholisism. The plot in Dogma does get a little confusing and the rules seem to change every 5 minutes and in the and you just end up looking at the clock hoping it is going to finish. The acting is ok accept fot the two , so called actors, who played the prophets. I have never seen them before and hope to never see them again in a movie they looked way out of their depth.

70,stamper,Kevin Smith's Jersey Flicks Part 4: Not quite yet the final insult,8,25 September 2000,"Well at the beginning it already becomes very clear, what kind of film you are in for. A comedy, but not only that a comedy that is a tag stupid. Not as stupid as Hot Shots though but still it is not intelligent and it is far away from normal. This however does not say that the film is bad, for odd films do seem to have an attraction sometimes. This one is not different. Ok this is not Mallrats, but it sure beats the hell out of Chasing Amy.
The story of this one seems very easy, two angels who were cast out from Heaven find a way back in and must be stopped, or the world will end. But this is not the bottom line of the movie, for it is so much deeper than that. There is a lot of mocking and satire going on here, but also a kind of admiration for faith. It is a mixture of what most young people nowadays think I guess and that is that believe is good, but sometimes organisations like the Catholic church overdo it. They are too hypocrite and stuff. So rather believe your own belief. Some might find this insulting, but hey, all I can say is: The FIRST amendment and hell, it's TRUE, so stop nagging.
The actors well there is a lot to say of them, but here comes the short version. You all know  at least a couple of these actors I presume and know they are good, but it just might happen, that like me you think at the beginning that they suck. Fear not my friend, it is merely the effort you have to make to get into the movie and the story that makes you think that. Later you will say the actors were good. You will also say the story was good, the jokes were (most of the time) good and you will have to say that it had a few flaws, but you enjoyed it. Look out for his last of the NJ series soon.

Dogma isn't just sex and crap jokes, well...ya it is but it's done in high taste and it comes packed with a philosophically honest and insightful story that delves in religion and belief. Dogma does demand an acquired intellect, and maybe some good virtue, a certain acumen in order to best effectively enjoy it. This movie is boring as ish if it's not thought provoking, but it's definitely not boring as ish; it's ridiculously amusing and completely f'ing hilarious. About all of the jokes are 'thinkers', Dogma's wry, ironic sense of humor.

They do poke fun at dogma, which is another word for our subconscious calcified belief systems-- the point being, I think,m that ANY belief system about ANYTHING is merely a way to get lost in a rut and thereby miss life. The movie's message seems to be-- Hey! Wake up and LIVE! Meanwhile, of course, the superficial aspects of our western culture's ideology-- primarily our religion-- takes it ""on the chin,"" and gets a perhaps well-deserved blasting. Go see it!

76,alice liddell,The Force is not with them.,5,19 January 2000,"In the absence of a decent STAR WARS movie in 1999, Kevin Smith decided to make his own cheapskate version.  It's all here - the Force (Christianity, God, whatever); the battle between good and evil (or good, mad and nihilistic);  the mythic, picaresque plot in which the hero(ine) is given a quest, and gathers (or is given) friends to help her complete it); the ordinary Jo(sephin)e who is plucked out, seemingly at random, to save the universe, but actually has significant family secrets; the ambiguous Vadar-like villains who have turned from good, and whose actions threaten the universe; the intergalactic (or whatever you call the spiritual realm) arena against which all of this is played out, which, for some reason, always has to have its locus in bad acting.DOGMA also has most of the flaws of the last STAR WARS farrago - a substitution of mythic hokum for plot, which means that the narrative limps forever, while the filmmakers make it up as they go along, and climactic moments are signalled by noise and music, because they don't arise naturally out of the drama; the bogging down of narrative with reams of interminably tedious talk - the fact that it's based on an actual religion rather than Lucasian mumbo-jumbo doesn't make it any less ridiculous; the privileging of this talk by ignoring all the resources of the cinema; lousy special effects (although with a low budget, Smith has more of an excuse); the assembling of a prestigious cast and then wasting them by making them either dull or the butts of bad jokes.I can't see why there was such a fuss in America about the blasphemy of this film - it's one of the most right-wing works I've seen in ages.  The heroine begins the film working in an abortion clinic, and ends it pregnant; her independent crisis of faith is repeatedly attacked by 'advisory' male figures; for all her importance as an action figure, she is a very passive character whose actions are dictated by men.  The conceit that the figure authorising this is a woman changes nothing - the film's creator is a man, and femaleness is just a ridiculous form this deity takes.The link between the film's creation and God's creation should not be underestimated.  The two most important figures in this incessant talkfest are, perversely, wordless - Silent Bob and God.  Both are seemingly marginalised, but it is Bob, standing for the director (both the same man) who creates the conditions in the film for Bethany to succeed.  This silence is ironic, because what he is defending is the Word of God.  Jacques Derrida once argued that Western culture was logocentric, i.e. based on the Christian idea of Jesus being 'The Word Made Flesh' - that all creative acts are an embodiment of Christian tradition.This film is one such act - Kevin Smith speaks for God, orders chaos, offers a very traditional story with a very traditional resolution, that upholds the very order he superficially seems to mock with this fruitcake ice-hockey loving God, irreverent angels, foulmouthed prophets, corrupt Catholics. Every age presents the Christian message in its own image, but that actual message is unchanging.One looks in vain for any undermining of this in the film.  Its failure is especially glaring when compared to the greatest ever film about religion, Bunuel's THE MILKY WAY.  That too was full of words, doctrines, dogmas, but Bunuel as an ex-Catholic, atheist, Surrealist and rigorous intellectual, was able to structure his film, show the disparity between the babble and the way it is filmed, opening up space for irony, analysis and critique.  The word most definitely was not made flesh.  There's no such disparity here, and the discourse rarely rises above the level of trivial laughs.  Only the acting could have saved it, but these smart-ass performers couldn't break into pathos for fear they'd crack - they're SO cool they can't hear us laughing at them.DOGMA isn't all bad - how many comic-fantasies about religion are we getting from mainstream(ish) Hollywood?  The best bits come from the tension between the ethereal crises that is the subject of the film, and the crass, laddish, often hilarious, earthy humour that is its content, courtesy, as ever, of Jay  and Silent Bob.  There are a couple of good jibes about gender and sexuality; religion and mythology; free will and destiny; but all are subsumed in the film's very conservative project.  Kevin Smith's terminal decline since CLERKS is, then, briefly halted, but only just.",Dogma
77,FlickJunkie-2,Irreverent and funny religious satire,7,22 May 2000,"This film is a wickedly irreverent lampoon of religion that holds a mirror up to the inconsistencies and absurdities of Christian biblical mythos, and more specifically Catholic dogma, by putting it in a modern context. 
It is the story of two fallen angels, Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and Loki (Matt Damon) that have been cast out of heaven and banished to live in Wisconsin. With the help of their friend, the devil Azrael (Jason Lee), they discover a loophole that allows them plenary absolution during a ceremony at a Church in New Jersey.  If they enter this church, they will be forgiven and be able to get back into heaven.  The trouble is that if they do this, God will be proven fallible and existence will come to an end.  So Metatron (Alan Rickman) recruits Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) who is the last scion of Christ to help stop them from entering the church.  The rest of the story is basically an action adventure/comedy sendup culminating in a confrontation on the church steps.Kevin Smith's story starts out razor sharp, with biting intellectual humor that mocks some of the basic tenets of religious belief, while simultaneously broaching some pretty deep philosophical questions. Unfortunately, as the film progresses, the edge is lost and it degenerates into a slapstick action flick with occasional returns to the religious allusions.  Overall, it was very entertaining, but the story could have been so much more if it stayed on point with wry intellectual forays, rather than degenerating into farce.The cast was delightful.  Matt Damon gets a chance to play a little less serious role and brings an enchanting comic naivete to Loki, the former angel of death and vengeance.  Affleck is the most intellectual and serious of the characters, and it is his ability to stay sincerely serious in absurd situations that makes him so funny.  Linda Fiorentino was terrific as the Catholic girl who had lost her faith.  She had a wonderful ability to broach disturbing thoughts that almost all of us have about God and religion, while maintaining a sense of mocking self doubt and comical despair. 
Chris Rock plays the spiritual guide; the unheralded 13th apostle of Christ. He brings his usual ironic style and hilarious assortment of facial reactions and steals more than half the laughs in the film.  And then there were Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes, once again reprising their roles and Silent Bob and Jay (a trademark of Kevin Smith films, he finds a way to insert these two characters into almost every movie he does).  There were also bit parts for Salma Hayek, George Carlin and Alanis Morissette (as God).This is a entertaining film that missed its chance to be a classic religious parody by losing its soul and going off the deep end.  Still, if you have the ability to have a sense of humor about God, there is a lot of good comedy here.  I gave it a 7/10.  Religious zealots steer clear.  This movie will either offend you or shake your faith.",Dogma
78,Bogmeister,What a messed-up universe,7,23 July 2005,"Here we have Kevin Smith's controversial anti-Catholic modern parable on God, Angels, and the always flawed humanity. (What's that you say? It's not anti-Catholic? K.Smith is religious himself? My, my...don't kid a kidder and let's not kid ourselves, OK?). But, humans ain't the only ones flawed in this pic; in K.Smith's world-view, Angels are seriously messed-up characters also. And the whole plot hinges on the 'fact' that even God can make errors: 2 outcast Angels, Bartleby & Loki (Loki? - didn't he fight Thor?), find a loophole in God's laws, which would allow them back into Heaven. Thing is, if they succeed in this, all of existence - predicated on God's flawlessness - would be erased. Thus, Smith's follow-up to his ""New Jersey"" trilogy about slackers has a genuine apocalyptic threat running in it. K.Smith himself and sidekick Jason Mewes reprise their roles as ""Jay & Silent Bob"" in helping various 'good' knights thwart the ultimate evil plan (orchestrated by another fallen angel, Azrael aka Jason Lee). This works as a comedy, and Smith throws in a lot of concepts you don't normally see piled on in just one movie, as well as some observations designed to embarrass the Catholic regime (such as, the church's convenient tolerance of slavery in the old days). So, this is ...what? - a religious, political, social commentary all rolled into one? Yeah, I guess, and things even take a dark turn near the end, with mass killing. Take warning, also, that Smith's characters are usually all foul-mouthed to the extreme. But, the central character, played by Fiorentino, is the most decent of the bunch, and carries the show with a fully-rounded performance not resorting to shtick or dogma (interesting that she's the actress K.Smith didn't get along with). When half the characters are Angels of one sort or another, it's no surprise that a kind of preaching tone permeates the script - a young, liberal 'live and let live' tone. But, on the other hand, a lot of it does make sense. In that slacker, New Jersey kind-of fashion. Next up ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back""(2001).",Dogma
79,movieguy1021,Dogma: 5/10,5,22 April 2003,"Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. These are the five View Askew movies, the movies directed and written by Kevin Smith. The only other one I had seen before Dogma was Jay and Silent Bob, which was funnier than this one.Linda Fiorentino is Bethany. She works in an abortion clinic and goes to church every Sunday, even though she has lost her faith. Meanwhile, two angels, Bartleby and Loki (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon), who were sentenced out of Heaven, find a loophole that would get them back into Heaven. They see an ad that says that all sins are forgiven when they walk through an archway of a church. So, if they cut off their wings and become mortal, then they will be forgiven and go to Heaven.However, this would lead to the end of the world. Since God is infallible, this would prove God wrong, so the world would end. The Metatron (Alan Rickman), who is the Voice of God, comes to tell Bethany that she is the one who has to stop Bartleby and Loki for reasons she finds out later. Along the way, she meets two prophets Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), the 13th Apostle Rufus (Chris Rock), and another Muse, Serendipity (Salma Hayek), to help her on the quest.Whenever I see a movie and go to write my review, I can always tell if it is going to be a good review or not, and this isn't one. I saw it in pieces, though, so that may be a reason. While Jay and Silent Bob had very raunchy and crude humor, Dogma seemed to stay pretty non-gross-out, with the only exception being the Noman, or, as put by Serendipity, a `sh*t demon'. You can guess what he looks like.All of the actors did their best acting job I've seen them in. Rock didn't seem to go for humor as much in this one, but I didn't find myself laughing too much at this one. He can be a good actor when not making fun of white people or being crude. Jason Lee, who plays another Muse banished to Hell, is great, also. I kept on wishing he were in more of the movie. Mewes was, well, Jay: foul-mouthed, sex-obsessed, and maybe a closeted gay. Fiorentino wasn't all that great, but she wasn't in Men in Black also. Affleck isn't a great actor overall, and it shows here. Damon was very good, because he IS a good actor, and so are Rickman and Hayek.Although it isn't plastered with cameos, it does feature a few. George Carlin is a Cardinal, Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Holleran (from Clerks) are featured in a few roles, and Alanis Morisette is God (when do you think you'd ever hear that?). Basically, if you're a big fan of other Smith movies, go for it. If you're just a casual fan or not one at all, go with another one.My rating: 5/10Rated R for strong language including sex-related dialogue, violence, crude humor and some drug content.",Dogma

No movie has ever given me two different, conflicting opinions as bad as this.Seriously, this movie has so many amazing moments of pure brilliance. Moments that stick with you for life. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are both superb, and they and they're characters are really entertaining to watch. Alan Rickman always is, always has, and always will be brilliant in anything and everything he does. Chris Rock's Black Disciple is extremely funny, and definitely one of his best performances ever. Jay and Silent Bob are also very welcome and very entertaining additions. The general storyline is genius and is easily rewatchable, with several stand-out scenes. At times, I really, really love this movie.However, amongst all that brilliance is the downright terrible that really niggles at me. Oh, if only I could ignore them, or cut them out completely. Why you might ask? Well for starters, Linda Fiorentino as the lead character Bethany is literally painful to watch. In fact, if she was cut out of the movie entirely, my rating would definitely jump to at least a 7, if not an 8. Outside of that are various scenes that just aren't funny at all, and similarly excruciating. But if it's not painful to watch, and it's not one of the scenes of brilliance, it's just downright boring and drags on.It's a brilliant movie that I love watching over and over again, but at the same time it's a terrible movie that I avoid watching as best I can.",Dogma

84,PeachHamBeach,"Wonderful, sincere, God glorifying, not heretical or sacrilegious",10,24 April 2005,"I haven't seen such a sincere ode to God in a long time. This totally original and fun film boasts an all star cast and tells the tale of a woman who was raised Catholic but works in a planned parenthood clinic, and who feels like her ""religion"" is empty and her faith in God has only let her down. Yet she is handed down a duty that, at first, seems ludicrous. Just go to a church in New Jersey on the day of its centennial celebration.God told Noah to build a big boat because it was gonna rain really hard for a long time. He told Adam and Eve not to eat a certain kind of fruit. He told Abraham to kill his kid and offer him up as a gift on an altar. God tells people to do weird things, and his requests really seem like they make no sense at all, but everything he asks is for a reason. I'm glad Kevin Smith didn't make Bethany's mission into some big, grand obvious thing, but rather a strange, simple thing that at first seemed ridiculous, and had to be explained little by little.The script is full of dialogue that is nothing but love of God, especially the dialogue of Rufus and Metatron. The two rebellious, clueless, and sad angels, Loki and Bartleby, begin as beings who really love and miss their relationship with God. Loki is angry and hoping to regain the favor of God by slaying wicked people (He used to be the Angel of Death) and Bartleby, once a peaceful-minded angel who convinced Loki that what he was doing was cold blooded, becomes so angry and resentful that God won't ever forgive angels like he does humans, pretty much turns into Satan Jr., willing to make war with God even though nothing he does will ever get him back into Heaven.Of course, Jay and Silent Bob are on hand, singled out to be prophets for God, at least for a while, and they accompany Bethany on her journey from Illinois to Jersey. En route, they meet Rufus, the 13th apostle who was never mentioned (surely there are plenty of apostles and heroes of the Bible who never got their limelight); Serendipity, an abstract who became semi-solid and stripteases to New Edition tunes!!!; and the stinky Golgothan Dook-Demon (not for weak stomachs!!!) The cast includes Linda Fiorentino, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Chris Rock, Salma Hayek, Jay and Silent Bob, a hysterical Jason Lee as Azrael, a demon who likes to play from all sides; and the always wonderful Alan Rickman, whose elegant presence blends in curiously well with characters who cuss and smoke weed. It all goes together in this wonderful, strange, but very sincere love letter to organized religion and its many flaws.More importantly, though, it's a love letter to God, not to a faction, a church, or list of man-made by-laws, but to God him/herself, containing what should be common sense knowledge that we all have, but sadly do not. That makes Kevin Smith a very perceptive voice for a generation who wants to know and love God without all the man made stuff getting in the way...Watch it without prejudice.

The dialogs and situations are very funny. The story is highly entertaining, captivating, and full of interesting plot developments.Ben Affleck and Matt Damon each delivered us great performances, especially when being wrathful or witty. That probably set into motion their future collaborations. Linda Fiorentino played her role as disillusioned Christian given an unlikely task very well, even more so in her emotional explosion which was very powerful. Alan Rickman was hilarious as the complaining neat freak. This is the type of role I think he's best with, the funny sarcastic kind.

You only have to read the reviews here to see with how much venom people hate this movie, because of their religious viewpoint, hate being an important word in religion. Look past the controversy, as i'm sure most users here do and Dogma, aside from being very funny, is quite life-affirming (A phrase i don't like using because i don't feel that i need a film or song to make me feel happy about my life), and will make you think twice about your faith, or lack of it. Watching Alanis Morisette as God, smiling, taking pleasure in doing a handstand against a tree was, for me, suspiciously moving.But if you just want fart and sex jokes delivered in a fast, witty way then Kevin Smith is your director, and Dogma is your movie. um. There is a Demon made of sh*t, Salma Hayek stripping for dollars, decapitations, and the usual capering from Jay and Bob, along with some classic dialogue.

The things they talk about in this movie are very cool, and some of it even truthful, such as the way God works and the way mankind warps religion to fit their own agenda. This movie isn't really hilarious like Mallrats, but it certainly has some very funny moments, but it's more intelligent, and it gives the movie an epic quality.The acting is very good.

I am not a believer, and I have an enormously wide margin for what I think is funny - basically, there is NOTHING one can't make fun of. It's just timing, respect and decency that limit comedy. And this film is right in every aspect. It has perfect timing: religion in any form is always blown out of proportion at the turn of a century, it respects God, for he truly is just and loving in this film. It is also decent, despite the harsh language and one special monster defeated with mouth spray - it is decent because it makes fun of religious people in a harmless way - I wonder how close to reality that ""buddy-Jesus"" came - no doubt experimenting with making the catholic church more popular has been done. Religion is the winner at the end, and God is still good and gracious.

While its not the blasphemy many claimed it to be, the Catholic church has some pretty outdated notions, so its fun to laugh at it once in awhile. But the film then goes on to be a a vehicle for modern political ideas that will one day probably be just as out of date as the catholic dogma that provided the foundation for this movie. ""Jesus was black"" ""The Bible is Rascist"" ""Abortion: What a woman does with her own body is her own business"" These items are presented to us by the religous characters in this movie, but not as parody, this is the ultimate truth that supports the comedy of poking fun at Catholicism. And its kind of silly, the all knowing creator spouting modern political slogans, cmon. Were this movie made in the 60s, Smith would have the Angels making fun of Nixon and the War in Viet Nam.

97,jayjaycee,"Intelligently dark humour, yet a little uneventful",7,1 February 2021,"""Dogma"" is a 1999 adventure comedy directed by Kevin Smith starring Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.
⚪
All in all, Kevin Smith's fourth directorial work ascends to comically celestial heights with hilariously decorated wings by combining doctrinal theology and dark humour to a weird yet fascinating road trip comedy that, despite its general silliness and a predictable plot, displays an extreme intelligence and knowledge about its sophisticated subject matter, and thanks to likable characters, effective side-blows and a script with love for detail, it becomes a strangely enjoyable and meticulous twist on the biblical movie genre that knows to mock as well as respect the themes it deals with.
⚪
After the previous film has been nothing short of a total catastrophe, I really hoped that Kevin Smith's next film would be much less offensive, insulting and uncomfortable to watch. Well, it is in fact much less awkward to watch, but I cannot really deny that it is less insulting to some, for it is an absolutely dark comedy about religion, Christian teaching and Armageddon. However, unlike his last feature, this one surprisingly displays a lot of intelligence, knowledge and, most importantly, respect towards the subject matter it deals with. What is this film even? Well, I cannot fully describe what it actually is supposed to be, but if I had to summarize it, I would say that this is the result of what would happen if you combined biblical spectacularity and comic book extravaganza to weird genre mix. Given that the writer-director is a professed fan of comics and was apparently raised a Catholic, it is no wonder that he seems to have comprehension about both aspects - unlike with his previous project. The result of this experimental undertaking is a naughty but nonetheless fascinating road trip movie that entertains with its basic premise as well as its dark humour. It displays a lot of respect towards religion and biblical values, but at the same time doesn't hesitate to point out the stupidity of some other aspects. Like, the main character, who turns out to be the last descendant of Jesus Christ is working at an abortion clinic that is constantly besieged by devout Catholics, and in another scene, it is revealed by one character that Jesus Christ himself was black and not white as everybody says. What makes it all so effective is that it exactly hits a sore point of many believers, and reportedly, it was successful, as the movie was later on protested against by the same people. However, since I am not really religious and can take dark humour, I had no problem at all with what is shown in here, quite the contrary, it was extremely fascinating. As mentioned above, Smith seems to know a lot about doctrine theology and hence knows to invent as well as to stage characters from the matter like superheroes. Next to the previously mentioned descendant of Christ, Bethany, we have the angel Metatron (brilliantly portrayed by Alan Rickman), the thirteenth apostle Rufus (who was never mentioned because he was black), a muse living on earth as a stripper, the mischievous Azrael, the two renegade angles Loki and Bartleby and, last but not least, two prophets - Jay and Silent Bob. Wait, what? Yes, exactly! Next to all the bible inspired characters you have your two favourite drug-dealing stoners accompanying the group with their abilities. Seriously, never ever have fictional characters been totally out of place and right were they belong at the same time. Together, they embark on an adventure to stop the boys from ""Good Will Hunting"", I mean, the two fallen angels from experiencing indulgence, thus proving that God is not infallible and inadvertently destroying existence itself. In the course of the film, Smith doesn't hesitate from calling attention to some valid points about the bible, for example why angels have no free will and humans do despite being his first creation, or that God in fact might be female or even that Jesus was no only child. There are so many ideas and legitimate discussions about it, that it is downright thought provoking, but even if it is mostly a great idea and a well-executed film, there is still one thing about it that bugs me a little. Most of the time, it shows the characters having sophisticated conversations about the total hilariousness of it, and once again it is so wittily written that it downright amazes me, but at the same time it affects the experience tremendously. Kevin Smith's love for detail and intention to satirize the whole subject results in a certain kind of uneventfulness. Like, the importance of each character is thoroughly explained and they are well-designed from start to finish, but considering how they are introduced, they all do comparatively little. They travel from Chicago to Jersey, arrive there and stop the angles - there isn't actually happening much more. It is kind of predictable, straightforward and proceeds without any major complications. I am not going to deny the ingeniousness behind it all, because it is seriously impressive, but at the same time the plot comes up short. In the end, it however tuns out to be an extremely enjoyable and intelligent experience. The characters are loveable, the cast is probably the most outstanding Smith was ever able to assemble, and the satire is wonderfully constructed. Also, Alanis Morissette plays God herself. How can you not love that idea? Weird, yet meticulously crafted and strangely fascinating.",Dogma
98,culwin,...,7,24 November 1999,"The whole problem with this movie is that practically everyone can find something to dislike about it.  It touches on so many ""hot button"" topics - sometimes even the mention of such topics like abortion, race, religion, violence are enough to set people off.  On top of that, this movie never defines itself - is it a comedy? drama? action-adventure? social/political statement? It's all of these things and more, and most people have a problem with that.  The acting isn't all that hot, to be honest, but that's why most Kevin Smith fans will find this movie appealing.  In any other movie, the lengthy dialogue and sometimes wooden acting would be awful, but somehow Kevin Smith makes this almost his trademark.  One noteable exception is Jason Lee, who does an excellent job in his smaller-than-usual role as 'Azrael'.  It's good to see him prove that he can play more than just a 'comic guy'.  This movie may be lost on the average movie-goer, but although this probably isn't a ""10"" it is definitely entertaining and thought-provoking.",Dogma

To describe the movie in one word I would say its unique.One thing I am tired of is hearing all of those ""75 year old widows who have nothing to do but complain"", complain about this being blasphemous. At the start of the movie it says that the film is entirely fictional and made for comic pleasure. If you don't like it don't watch it, remember there's always an off button on the remote. Thats the end of that.I really liked Linda Fiorentini portayal of the skeptical decintigrating christian Bethany Sloan. Alan Rickman is as good as ever as the head angel Metranon.

102,ExpendableMan,"Very, very good but not Smith's best",7,29 June 2007,"Dogma, director Kevin Smith's very personal celebration (and gentle ribbing) of Christianity is one of the strongest entries on his CV, as well as the third funniest film to be set in the so-called View Askewniverse, (after the two Clerks movies). It is not however, a film that withstands repeat viewings with its integrity fully intact and while it remains as fresh and funny as ever each time you pop the DVD in of an evening, one or two cracks do begin to emerge. One question that will perhaps keep recurring though is just what it is exactly that the Catholic league has against this movie? Okay, some folks might have a bit of a problem with God being played as a frolicking garden pixie shaped like Alanis Morrisette and wonder why it was that the maker of all creation had to be so irritating. And yes, having the last known descendant of Christ be an abortion clinic worker was bound to rile up a fundamentalist or two. And George Carlin's brilliantly hilarious Priest isn't exactly the standard depiction of a senior clergyman by any means...but the heart of the movie is very much a celebration of Christianity. Faith is presented quite clearly as a rewarding and beautiful thing and what Dogma really boils down to is a criticism of organised religion, so you do have to wonder what the fuss is? Actually, I think I just answered my own question there...Anyway, the plot is a surprisingly active one for a Kevin Smith film. Not content with writing another laid back slacker adventure, he has his eyes firmly set on a biblical road movie in which a woman named Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) suddenly finds herself being called upon from on high to stop two angels from exploiting a loophole and making their way back to heaven, the pair having been banished after a drinking binge got ugly. Joining her on this quest are Chris Rock as the wise cracking thirteenth apostle (he was left out of the bible because he's black apparently) and Smith regulars Jay and Silent Bob.What follows is not only hogs heaven for all Smith geeks out there but also a film that anyone who isn't a Catholic league member can enjoy. Newcomers will relish the back and forth dialogue, witty exchanges and pop culture nods that Smith is the master of, while those who like to get a bit more in depth will also find plenty to chew on as they play ""Spot the Regular"" (Hey, there's Randall! And hey hey, there's Dante too...And that's the restaurant they work in...). While the script remains fantastically written as always, Dogma's more busy pace is a welcome change from the norm, even as it becomes apparent that exiled Angels of Death are prone to the same sort of conversations as disgruntled convenience store owners.However, while it is all riotously enjoyable on the first viewing, second time around it isn't quite so good. Don't get me wrong, it's still fantastic stuff, but something's missing. Smith, for all his writing strengths hasn't quite learnt how to craft a road movie, a fact that becomes especially apparent when the gang are threatened by a foul-smelling demon but despite imminent death, Salma Hayek still finds time to rattle off an incredibly detailed description of its origins and lifestyle. Furthermore, Linda Fiorentino wasn't the right choice for Bethany, the majority of her lines being delivered in a bored and passionless manner that suggests she would much rather be anywhere else than on the set of a Hollywood movie working with a famous director. The increased involvement of Jay and Silent Bob meanwhile may raise a few cheers, but the extension of their roles from mere cameos serves to demonstrate how painfully unfunny Jason Mewes really is.That said, Dogma is still a fun movie. It is an energetic and spirited romp which the director clearly poured his heart into and while there are weak links, the majority of the cast are on top form (especially Ben Affleck, who has charisma practically gushing out of his ears). Click on the trivia section of this page and you'll find that Smith originally wanted Robert Rodriguez to direct it and had he done so the movie would have been arguably better paced, but have lost a little bit of its soul along the way. And just in case this analysis is giving the wrong impression (hey, even I'm starting to think I'm being hard on the guy), Dogma is a great movie. It's just not a fantastic one, that's all.",Dogma

Yes I'm puzzled (hence all the questions) but also angry that people like Damon, Fiorentino and Rickman should waste their time on something like this. Sh*t demons? More like sh*t producers and directors. A well-groomed guy with limpets stuck on his lily white forehead is supposed to be what, exactly? Alanis Morissette as God?

104,Jerique,Regret missing this 12 years ago...,7,22 April 2011,"You know back in 1999, I had seen a lot of movies. I was barely 11 years old, but I'd seen The Matrix, Big Daddy, The Green Mile, American Pie, The Phantom Menace, The Sixth Sense, Cruel Intentions, Toy Story 2, The Mummy, Sleepy Hallow and Austin Powers II, to name a few. But, I unfortunately didn't see Dogma. Maybe it was because I was so young and I didn't get to pick movies to buy or rent. Maybe it was because my parents didn't want to have me watch a controversial religion movie that pokes fun at Catholics and Christians and such. Whatever the reason, I regret not seeing it 12 years ago...Dogma follows the story of Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartelby (Ben Affleck), two angels cast down from Heaven and trying to find a loophole in order to get back in. Chris Rock, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith and Linda Fiorentino are charged with the mission of stopping them, while Jason Lee plays the angel who wants to help them get back to Heaven.I never expected to laugh as much as I did. But a majority of the jokes aimed at religion are quite an interesting take as well as a hilarious one. Kevin Smith is a brilliant writer and one of my all-time favourites. It's simply to understand this because well he knows how to make you laugh. He actually gives some sense of perspective even though he's making fun of some of these religious claims. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I understood that it's a work of fiction...but clearly Kevin did a lot of research beforehand.It doesn't have any miraculous special effects, although the horns on Jason Lee are wicked along with the awesome wings on Ben Affleck. It's great to see Ben be such a bad-ass. I mean, he really hones his acting in this one, and I know there are a lot of Ben haters out there, but he's actually a talented fellow, I think. I especially love the scene where Damon and Affleck are spouting out all the nasty deeds the people in the office of Mooby's have done in their lives. It was such great memorization on their parts and even better delivery and timing. It's wonderful to see them be hilarious, nefarious and downright brilliant all the same time.All that being said, people will never agree on this movie being great or awful for the simple fact of it's subject matter being too controversial and too personal. It hits home with too many people and thus it makes it beyond difficult to judge the movie with an objective view because it's so... sensitive. Perhaps, my bias of liking Smith's films (especially the View Askew universe) I am being generous in my rating. But, so be it, I will be on the minority, I guess, for liking this film. It's not supposed to be a work of insults. It's just a funny fantasy movie and it's just a good film to entertain you for two hours.",Dogma

In her way he will find a weird group of people hat will help her in her task. Though it is very, very funny, in most jokes and gags can result a bit disgusting, specially for religious people, because the jokes (plenty of them) about all the incoherences of catholic religion (all other religions too). With great actors and very very good dialogs, it is a very ludic film (you'll laugh a lot!), but some times, it results to disgusting,in its jokes. In addition, an unexpected totally gore-ending, which is done with a very bad taste, makes the final result much worse as you could expect while seeing the first half-hour (the best of the film).

For a motion picture that is supposed to take a farcical approach towards organized religion (namely Catholicism), it surely revels in its own inflated sermonizing.

The numerous references to the so called ""holy book"" are really funny and uncompromising,which makes it a dangerous movie in America where the religious groups are very influential.The acting overall is top of the bill,especially by Chris Rock (as the black apostle!!),Linda Fiorentino (who plays the heroine),Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith.But the highpoint of the movie acting wise is Alan Rickman as he plays Metatron.The way that Rickman plays his role is simply astonishing,so superb!Kevin Smith who not only directs the film but also plays in it again creeps in the role of his alter ego Silent Bob.His only line the entire movie is a direct quote from ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"".After he has thrown Loki (a very good Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck who was a talented actor until he met up with J-Lo) from the train pronouncing the words =>NO TICKET!Jay (Jason Mewes) is the very vulgar and unsubtle of the two heroes and he does so with flair.

Along the way, she is aided by two prophets, Jay and Silent Bob. With the help of Rufus, the 13th Apostle, they must stop those who stand in their way and prevent the angels from entering Heaven.This is the second time I got myself immersed in the world of writer/director Kevin Smith's View Askewniverse (the first one being Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back) and in my opinion it got a whole lot better the second time around. Jay and Silent Bob was funny but in the weirdest of ways. It seemed like they were just resorting to Jay's cussing and bad mouthing to make the audience laugh. But the toilet humor can be funny on a certain extent. It can't work all the time that's why I'm in the middle when it comes to Jay and Silent Bob.But that is not the case here, Dogma on the other hand, had all the perfect laughs and offending humor with perfect timing. Even at the start of the film, I mean the very start with the disclaimer, oh man that was hilarious with Kevin Smith's fetish for platypuses and the aforementioned warning with the offensive tone of the film. Kevin Smith is a writing genius no questions asked. He knew his film would be torched by religious sects and fanatics so before they even got to it, he made his move with the disclaimer.The funniest scene has got to be the part where a naked Chris Rock just fell out of nowhere and then Jay says ""Beautiful, naked, big-titted women just don't fall out of the sky, you know"" oh man that was classic.

I wondered if they just wanted another remake of ""Clerks,"" ""Mallrats,"" or ""Chasing Amy.""I happen to think that this IS typical Kevin Smith -- he is always inventive and idealistic; and there is idealism enough here for three movies.His questions regarding religion are ones that theologians have been asking for years; and indeed, most run-of-the mill people ask (or should have asked) themselves.I was amazed at the amount of Biblical knowledge displayed.  The hints about the Apochrypha (the ""lost"" books of the Bible)attest to that.Chris Rock as the 13th Disciple is great. His line at the end of the film about Jay and Silent Bob not getting into heaven unless they clean up their language is priceless if you have ever seen his uncensored act on HBO.This is the first movie I have ever liked Salma Hayek in.  She turns in a fine, and strangely believable, performance as the Muse.I do question the casting of Alanis Morissette as God -- I would have gone the same route as ""Absolutely Fabulous"" and cast Marianne Faithful as God. Though Marianne might not be able to pull off the ""playful"" God this role requires. Also, since it is God's voice that destroys man (6 Adams before they figured THAT one out) she didn't need to roar -- a whisper would have done it.Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are perfect in their roles as the two fallen angels:  Bartleby and Loki.  Their conversation in the garage after their exodus from the train is truly astounding writing.Everyone in the quite full theater the afternoon I saw it laughed at different times in the film.  So different things appealed to different people -- as it should be.This is not a movie that regular church-on-Sunday Catholics should see -- or maybe THEY are the ones who most need to see it.There is much food for thought here -- if only you have an open enough mind to think it.",Dogma

The movie (much of which has a ramshackle roadshow kind of feel) evidences both Smith's often childishly scatological, combative approach to things and a strangely noble attempt to grapple with the status and relevance of Catholicism - it's silly and profound, often simultaneously, as if embarrassed by its flirting with significance: when the tone takes on some gravity, it's usually instantly undermined (""Mass genocide's the most exhausting activity one can engage in,""	 says Angel Of Death Matt Damon, ""next to soccer"") and whatever squirming the faithful might initially feel (the first scene with the ""Buddy Jesus"" doesn't make for the strongest beginning) should surely find some release in the faith-friendly outcome.

Damon and Affleck go round on a violent killing spree while discussing their feelings towards God and humanity, Fiorentino looks absolutely bored and uninterested in her serious bits of the film, while Chris Rock, Jay, and Silent Bob do T&A jokes. Dogma definitely looks expensive, and the cast (or parts of it) suggests that it could be quite good, but it never manages to find its tone.Smith's best film is undoubtedly Chasing Amy, in which he managed to do a film that took itself seriously. Sure, Jay and Silent Bob were in that one too, but only in one scene, and even then they didn't act as silly as they normally do.

If you found this scene acceptable entertainment, and admitted it to me, I would do my best to avoid you from that point, onward. You may say that ""...it is only a movie"", or that I need to ""lighten up"", but I contend that we need to correct our heads and inject some morality in our lives. Don't get me wrong.., I can accept some violence in movies, but it has to be FOR A REASON. Don't come at me with gratuitous violence and expect me to swallow it. The fact that the Dogma reviewers here, at IMDb, have made no mention of being repulsed by the opening scene gives me a clear view of the deeply-wounded U.S. society.., one which favors war, gangs, guns, injury, destruction and death.

122,K-Slicer,One of the Ten Best of 1999,10,7 May 2001,"This movie is one of the funniest movies of all time.  Kevin Smith puts together a movie that defines 'satire' almost perfectly.  The only flaw that this movie has are how long it is.  Even though the movie is almost two and half hours, it delivers enough philosophy to keep people thinking long after watching it.  ""Was Jesus Christ black?"" and ""Is there someone out in the world that is a direct descendent of Mary and Joseph?"" are very thought provoking.The satire elements in this movie are well done.  I thought the edition of George Carlin as the self-centered Cardinal Glick was an especially nice touch.  I am a George Carlin fan and I have heard his routines about taxing the properties of the Catholic Church.  I think the issues with race and women in the Bible were dealt with in a fine way as well. The dialogue was smart and witty and the cast did particularly well.  Jay and Silent Bob took the movie with their wise-cracking, foul-mouthed wit and humor.  I am also a huge Kevin Smith fan and he incorporated elements from all of his other movies.This is the best Kevin Smith movie since Clerks.  10 out of 10.",Dogma

But not five minutes into it, my worries were nullified and I couldn't stop laughing. The plot is wholly original and pretty gutsy, but Kevin Smith is a good director and did a wonderful job with it. The entire cast is perfect, with Alan Rickman being my personal favorite. The things brought up in the movie were really interesting and a lot of fun, and even the parts that should have offended me were clever. While it wasn't that ""complete"" in terms of explaining things, it was still definitely worth watching. I would even go so far as to call it the religious version of ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"". Honestly, the only parts I didn't like were the Golgotha and the crappy CGI wings.

There was one scene in which a man was scolded for disowning his gay son, but that hardly makes up for the obviously-held assumption of this movie that gay people are just for mocking. There were LOTS of good laughs in this movie, and at times I was loving it, but the anti-gay slaps and the weak ending (with a ditsy-acting woman as God) made it all seem quite moronic to me.

128,Asteri-Atypical,"Gutsy & unconventional but would have been better with more philosophy, less trash",6,27 November 2001,"This film was an unusual amalgam of value and that without value.It was refreshing to see a film depart so far from standard mores.  In a movie climate where most everything is based on rehashed stories and standard archetypes, this film challenges at least religious conviction. For that, it's worth seeing.However in a film that defies convention in some ways it certainly didn't rise above the smut.  While it can be amusing to hear a little swearing in the face of religion, this film goes overboard.  I can accept ""Silent Bob"" as a character but ""Jay"" added nothing at all to this film.  In fact he (along with his character's lines) could easily be considered the worst part about it.If you can ignore the worthless attempts to satisfy the teenagers who get thrilled by hearing the ""F"" word, Linda Fiorentino and Alan Rickman deliver outstanding performances.For a film that has such a daring theosophical message, I would like to have seen a lot more philosophy.  Why hint at it on nothing more than a sophomoric level?  Really make some people think!  If you're going to rattle them, why not explore new thoughts more deeply?  If you're going to be so bold with a message, why not argue that message more convincingly?  While it was certainly a relief to see a movie with SOME depth, it should have had more.All in all, I would recommend seeing it for the 'nerve' it shows, but I would not recommend seeing it for the overall quality of the film.  It had some moments and some interesting thoughts but the screentime given to moronic behaviour, drugs, rampant swearing and constant, overbearing attempts at gore (e.g. a monster made of excrement) ruined it for me.",Dogma
129,Mr. Pulse,"Funny, Interesting Flick",9,27 February 2000,"""Dogma"" is not Kevin Smith's best film.  Nor is it his funniest (I'd have to give ""Chasing Amy"" to the former, ""Clerks"" the latter).  Still, it's a very well made, funny film about religion.I watched it when it was first in theaters, anticipating it more than almost any other movie, and I was not disappointed.  From before the opening credits to end credits, the film is very funny.  Smith's script is, as always, brilliant.  Watching it again for the second time I really enjoyed the strong chemistry between the characters.Not to mention the acting; which, as Smith's reputation grows, gets better and better each flick.  Particular stand-outs are Matt Damon, who has the tougher role of the two ""GWH"" guys, but is absolutely perfect; and Jason Mewes, as his ol' alter-ego Jay.  It's his biggest part, and he is absolutely hysterical throughout.  I just wish the guy would make more movies.Sadly though, ""Dogma"" isn't perfect.  The ending is somewhat weak, and there are a few slow parts.  Still, the great script and cast, and some absolutely brilliant scenes (Loki and Bartleby in the parking garage being my particular favorite) make ""Dogma"" a definite must-see.Thanks.",Dogma

Not that this film is virulently anti-Catholic, mind you.  It just pokes fun only at Catholicism specifically.  Perhaps Kevin Smith was raised Catholic and resents it?Either way, it's funny for a film that's really out there.  The synopsis should be pretty clear, so I won't go on rewriting that for you.  Linda Fiorentino and Salma Hayek are great, as is Chris Rock.  Matt Damon showed a bit more range than I thought he had - good for him.I have some things about Ben Affleck.  He portrayed the role of Bartleby just as most actors would.  That's the thing.  For such an out there film, I would have expected him to go above and beyond to do this role.  But instead of looking like a raging angel, he looks like Ben Affleck - too recognizable.  He also seems a bit young to play a dark, demonic role. Maybe if he had some more stress lines in his face, or maybe some blemishes. But from what i've seen, the only bad guys he plays real well are bullies or jerks.  But, he did good enough.  I was just hoping for more from such a well known guy.Smith did alright as well.  The filming itself is nothing special, really - he makes a much better writer than director.  Not to say he's a bad director, just average.  But he is an above average writer.  Rent this film if you don't mind crude and sexually suggestive language.  It's pretty good.",Dogma

133,Keyser Soze-12,Hilarious but a little too preachy.. long live Jay and Silent Bob!,8,24 December 2000,"I'm a pretty big Kevin Smith fan, so I like just about anything he makes. I liked Dogma, but it is not my favorite movie of his.First off, this movie goes a little overboard on the preaching.  This movie seems less like a comedy and more like religious theology.  Kevin Smith, the writer/director/producer of this film, has spent almost ten years writing this movie.  If you look at the end of his first movie, Clerks, it says, ""Jay and Silent Bob will return in Dogma."" There were two movies in-between Clerks and Dogma, Mallrats and Chasing Amy.  So it's pretty obvious Smith put his heart and soul into this movie.  But had he made room for more comedy and less talk of how the humans `got it all wrong' in the Bible, I believe the movie could have been much, much better.Another problem is some of the jokes are pretty pointless.  Example: The S**t Monster.  That's what it is, a monster that rises out of a toilet made of, you guessed it, excrement.  Not only does it have nothing to do with the plot; it's not even funny.  Another bad point is that Salma Heyak, one of the hottest women I've ever seen, can't act very well.Okay, enough bad stuff, on to the good.  Anything involving Loki and Bartleby is comic genius.  Loki says one of my favorite quotes of all time: ""Are you kidding me? Any moron with a pack of matches can start a fire. Raining down sulfur takes a huge level of endurance. Mass genocide is the most exhausting activity one can engage in, next to soccer.""  These two guys are hilarious.Next, Chris Rock is good, but he can't act very well. I wish they had gotten Eddie Murphy for that role.Let's not forget that memorable line, `Gear?'Next, George Carlin. as a Bishop!  HU HA! That's funny in by itself!I love this movie.  Even though it sometimes goes on and on about religion, there are enough funny lines and great scenes in this movie to make up for it.  I was surprised how dramatic the movie got before the end.  Matt Damon and Ben Aflack were perfect for those roles.  The choice of Alanis Morissette as God is a bit strange, but I'm okay with it.8/10",Dogma
134,CherryBlossomBoy,This should serve as an eye opener...,8,19 October 2009,"...provided that people care about it.Only Kevin Smith knows what his real intentions were when he penned the script for ""Dogma"". I read somewhere that this is a thinly veiled propaganda for catholic church, or Christianity in general.I don't see it that way at all. First of all, the surface is not thin at all. There are layers and layers of clever gags, dark humor and satire in this ride of pursuit.The main premise is relatively simple - two rogue (or rejected or whatever) angels live on through present day, still doing what they've been doing throughout the Bible and trying to get back to heaven. Their only way to do it is through a loophole in catholic dogma, which, if exploited, would prove that god is fallible. For that they must be stopped and an earthly creature is recruited for the task. There is little time and thus the pursuit begins. During it various biblical elements come into play through their present-day form.To some ""Dogma"" was eternal biblical struggle relived and modernized to better adjust to modern viewers. There are some argument in favor of that view. I'd say that the sheer fact that it's a satire (some poignant moments notwithstanding) and the campiness of realization actually tell the opposite tale. They show how this stuff the legends are made from (and still worshiped) fares when viewed through a prism of real life.The two archetypal angels may have been prosecutors of evil in the Bible, but in real life they are just two self-righteous angry mass murderers. A biblical monster is in real life just a pile of crap, a dangerous one but crap nevertheless. God may be an infallible, omnipresent, omnipowerful creature in the Bible, but in reality its set of values, rules and powers are more becoming of a pop star than of a being that supposedly created everything. In fact you have to wonder about the power of ""god"" that has to follow rules.Other various gags and skits, such as the black apostle (13th one at that), play on a virgin working in an abortion clinic and the other ones only reinforce the sense of unsubtle ridicule. In that regard ""Dogma"" did and will repel many a religious viewers and stir certain controversy. But its subtle message that the whole story is ultimately meaningless might finally make some people question their beliefs at last.",Dogma

It's pretty easy to see why ""Dogma"" gave William Donahue a hissy fit, but it's a very well done film, and much more reverent of true faith than it's given credit for.Ben Affleck has been getting a raw deal lately, in relation to Matt Damon; he's widely considered to be the ""and"" member of the two.  The film starts out reinforcing that situation, but the situations are dramatically reversed midway through with very satisfying results.  It's nice to see Ben get to flex his dramatic muscles.  He hasn't gotten anywhere near as good a role since ""Good Will Hunting.""Linda Fiorentino is also very good in her role as the Last Scion (and correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the script refer to her as Jesus' great-great-great-great (etc.)-niece?  Every post I've seen on here refers to her as His direct descendant).  She's another performer who doesn't get the roles she deserves, and I'd love to see her in another role like this one.  Jason Lee is diabolically good as Azrael, and Chris Rock is hilarious as Rufus (though I could have lived a long and happy life without seeing his bare butt.

139,cinemel,"Witty, engrossing, brilliantly written fantasy",7,11 November 1999,"Kevin Smith has written and directed a witty, outlandish, engrossing and sometimes absurd fantasy entitled ""Dogma"". Matt Damon (Loki) and Ben Affleck (Bartleby) are two angels who have been expelled from heaven. George Carlin (Cardinal Glick) has unintentionally made it possible for their re-entry into paradise. However, this loophole will prove G-d wrong and thereby negate all existence. Alan Rickman (Metatron) is sent to Earth to ask Linda Fiorentino (Bethany), the last known descendant of Jesus, to stop them and save the world. In her travels she meets up with two prophets, Jason Mewes (Jay) and Kevin Smith (Silent Bob), two minor characters from Smith's `Chasing Amy', and Rufus (Chris Rock), the 13th apostle, who aid her in carrying out her mission. Salma Hayek also has a supporting role as Serendipity, the muse, who adds lots of beauty as she helps the group toward their goal. Affleck and Damon are their usual charming selves. Fiorentino, so perfect in `The Last Seduction', adds another important role to her gallery of portrayals. Chris Rock is hysterical with his great comic timing. Even Alanis Morrisette has a sweet cameo.This plot summary cannot begin to describe Smith's genius at giving his characters witty and wise dialogue to speak. Smith's musings on the absurdity of organized religion as juxtaposed to his belief in a deity and its ultimate good.  The production design by Robert Holtzman creates a surrealistic but believable world in which this assortment of characters travels. Some scenes are violent and slightly over the top.

140,ericjg623,"Pretty good, but with flaws",7,31 January 2002,"Kevin Smith's problem, at least for me, is that he made ""Clerks"" first, a true 10/10, and nothing he's done since has quite measured up. That aside, this is still a pretty good film, a comedy that also takes on some serious issues concerning organized religion, while avoiding, for the most part, being excessively preachy about it. The best parts, as in all Smith films, are the dialog scenes. In this instance, we get conversations between a woman who goes through the motions of attending church but has pretty much lost faith, a pair of fallen angels looking for revenge, another angel who needs to enlist the woman (Bethany) to stop the aforementioned evil duo, Rufus, the ""13th Apostle"", Serendipidy the Muse (played by the sizzling Salma Hayek) and of course, Jay & Silent Bob, a pair of clueless stoner prophets. Each of the characters is well constructed and acted, and their various interactions shed an unconventional light on many aspects of the Catholic Church in particular, and religion in general. Hardcore fundamentalists would probably find this movie insulting, even blasphemous, but the rest of us will see it for what it is, a humorous look at some of the foibles of organized religion. Kevin Smith clearly can distinguish between poking fun at certain ""Dogmas"" while at the same time showing respect for the larger underlying concepts of faith and goodness.What doesn't work, however, are the ""action"" scenes, most notably the ending, which gets pretty bloody and gory. Not to mention his choice of ""God"", who is uncredited and thus, I suppose, considered a ""spoiler"", so I'll merely say that the classic Rodney Dangerfield line `Last time I saw a mouth like that, it had a hook in it' aptly describes the actor chosen for this honor. Also, he relies too much on gross out humor, which is a shame, since comic dialog is really his forte. For example, angels apparently have no sex organs. Fine, he can tell us that, he doesn't need to have Alan Rickman pull down his pants and show us. And show us and show us, in a scene that seems to go on forever. And then there's the great poop monster-demon. Perhaps Kevin Smith saw how successful movies like ""Dumb & Dumber"" and ""There's Something About Mary"" were, and decided to get on the gross bandwagon, but at least for me, it just doesn't work. And, in a film about religion, he probably could have cut back on the gratuitous swearing a bit without losing any of the humor.

""What if God did this, or what if God did that?..."" What if God told you to leave him the hell out of your silly chatter? Circular logic and self confirming irrationality dominate the talk. I chuckled a bit in the first twenty minutes, mostly at the absurd ""foul"" language, but from then on I was stone faced. It was mind numbing.This cute game of tentatively defying ""the powers that be"" with seemingly irreverent banter is so juvenile. Apparently, if you like to think of yourself as spiritually sensitive but fashionably hip this type of psychological masturbation is considered good fun. I am bored with the whole lame, puny, primitive subject of God and morality and evil, so the intense discussions were grating and depressing. It wore me down. I needed to hear a strong voice declare that it was all stupid. No one finally clears their throat and plainly declares all the God chatter to be meaningless noise, complete bull#@$!.Absolutely the most emotionally, psychologically, physically tragic endeavor Mankind has ever engaged in is the formalization and perpetuation of these superstitious, paranoid, ignorant beliefs as evidenced by all the pain, suffering and mayhem that is their heritage. The film never even remotely approaches the contempt and scorn that this subject warrants. There's just way too much tolerance here of even the more seemingly benign aspects of faith, since I believe that the more moderate, average, ""reasonable"" believer is in fact the most potent, persistent promulgator of these harmful, destructive, idiotic doctrines. The curious inconsistencies and sweet little hypocrisies of mainstream religion are a growing cancer on the ""soul"" of humanity. Yeah, I believe this, and so do plenty of other people.

Most humor was completely degenerative (I'll site the giant monster made of bubbling, human excrement, for example!) and completely un-original in plot (to anyone who's ever read a book of theological philosophy, science fiction or even a Marvel comic-book).

Matt Damon and Ben Affleck don't deliver any outstanding performance, they are just too complacent with the allegedly witty character of their roles. The women in this movie are all the Garefalo type, cynics who think they can overpower men because of their wit. I sometimes am able to enjoy this kind of humor, but in this film they simply overdid it. Sorry!",Dogma
150,Rhino Rover,quite good,7,7 December 1999,"First thing I have to say is that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie BUT I have to admit, this is not a movie for everyone. If you haven't heard of this controversial film yet, it deals with religion, in particular the teachings of the bible, and as a result will invariably offend some people. Especially with the way this movie portrays religion.Dogma is a story about two angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) who were banished from heaven by God for some past mischievous acts. In a desperate attempt to get back into heaven, the two angels planned to exploit a loophole in God's teachings by passing through the arches of a church in New Jersey on a particular day. However if they are successful in doing this, they will inadvertently erase the existence of man and everything God created by proving that God is not perfect. In an attempt to stop this, God's messenger (Alan Rickman) recruits the help of a ""special"" mortal (Linda Fiorentino) to prevent the two angels from reaching New Jersey and passing through the arches of the church. Along the way Fiorentino meets up with two bumbling ""prophets"" (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith - director) and Rufus, the 13th Apostle (Chris Rock) who help her in her quest.If you were expecting a fancy Hollywood movie, you'll be disappointed. This has the feel and look of a low budget ""B"" movie but in this case, special effects and bright lights weren't needed. The humor was laced throughout and quite funny and the cast was very good, especially Rickman's character. The only thing that I question was the director's (Kevin Smith) choice for God. I realize he wanted to show that God is not this serious being but a fun loving deity but I found having Alanis Morissette portray God completely irritating.As a warning to anyone who wants to see this movie, there is an incredible amount of foul language and sexual dialogue. This may be the source of many people's dislike for this movie as it is combining religion and toilet humor together but it definitely makes for an entertaining time.Overall, I liked this movie. It took a very serious topic and showed to everyone that it is not necessary to take religion so rigidly, nor should it be the end all and be all of how you live. My suggestion though is that if religion is something that you take very seriously then don't see this movie. However if you approach this movie with an open mind, you will find it funny and entertaining.",Dogma
151,Rozinda,Quite entertaining but for the toilet humour,5,12 March 2010,"I give this 5 out of 10 for the good acting and the original idea. I'm not so impressed with all the ways the idea was developed - 4 only for that - and the crude and childish toilet humour spoils the movie. However, British humour is of course rather different and in this movie there is a clear humour culture gap. Depends what you like.I also soon got bored with Loki's inclination to gratuitous bloody slaughter whenever he felt inclined although I could see the point of why he does it and Damon acts the part splendidly as a kind of perverted Bourne but the final mass slaughter is totally going too far.Damon and sardonic Rickman as the sardonic Voice of God are the best things in this movie and one of the Voice's best cracks is that they had to make 5 Adams before working out why the earlier ones exploded. Mostly the movie is just quite fun, but Rickman's far too few appearances lift it to a higher level for a bit.If you can ignore the frequent toilet humour and just concentrate on the story, it's worth watching once to see how the theme is developed. The send up of the Catholic church mostly works. The loophole is very neat. I felt the depiction of God was weak although a good try. The finale for the heroine of the tale is clever.Worth watching once. But I couldn't sit through that toilet humour again.",Dogma

And somehow it fits this movie too. It's irreverent, cocky, wild and crazy, seductively sedated, funny, sad, joyful and stupid. But hey .. it's a movie, dummy! Sit back and enjoy it! Laugh! Silent Bob is the most articulate and meaningful actor in Hollywood!
Okay, it does get a little stupid having Chris Rock play an Apostle. His style of humor gets a little old faster than it takes to cook a three minute egg .... on high .... but still it works. If nothing else, go see the movie so you can see Matt Damon shoot people. I did find that oddly enjoyable.",Dogma
153,bobbyelliott,High School production,2,29 December 1999,"My fears about this film were raised right at the start when captions told the audience that this wasn't a serious movie. Films that have to tell its audience what they're about are usually rubbish. And this one was no exception.On a positive note, the movie tries to impart a serious message - that organised religion (especially in the shape of the modern Catholic Church) is bad and has lost sight of its true meaning. The movie succeeds in doing this - but in the same way that a High School production can impart a message - crudely and pompously. This movie has many parallels with an amateur production. The acting is awful - really *awful* - by the end of the movie the few decent actors in the film looked like they weren't getting paid enough and were going through the motions. The dialogue is painful and could have been written by a 15 year old who has just discovered that Santa Claus isn't real - and wants to tell the world.Contrary to reports, the movie isn't anti-religious (in fact it's pro-religion in that it takes the existence of God and Heaven as read) or even anti-Catholic (Catholicism has lost its way a bit but it's still the one true faith).This is the second time that the IMDb has got it seriously wrong - both this movie and 'Eyes Wide Shut' were given high ratings - and both are pretentious nonsense.",Dogma
154,Cheetah-6,If You Believe In The Bible.,8,22 June 2000,"If you believe in the Bible, It shouldn't be much of a stretch to believe in this movie. The Bible has as many bizarre, fantastic and arbitrary plot turns and twists, not to mention violence and experiences of revelation. God in the Bible comes off just as manipulative and unavailable as she/he does in Dogma. This is great religious parody and satire. I also give Kevin Smith credit for making an effort ahead of time to tell people he had no intention of offending anyone and not take it too serious, just have a good laugh. How many directors are that considerate? He even thanks his parents for raising him catholic in the closing credits.  The self serious religious types it seems are always looking for ways to be offended. The only thing that has to do with religion that they do approve of is usually something put out by their respective institutions.",Dogma

If you are worried that this film is is sacrilegious, don't be beacuse it is, but then it's not meant to be taken seriously.

And that film is called ""Dogma.""  He was supposed to make this movie after his his debut ""Clerks,"" but, made ""Mallrats"" instead and failed miserably.  So, he hold ""Dogma"" for awhile and made ""Chasing Amy,"" which got excellent reviews.  So, it's 1999.  What's next for Kevin Smith?   Time to get ""Dogma"" made.  When it opened in theatres everywhere, it was protested by Catholics everywhere because of its use of language and its strong crude sexually humor and it made of the Catholocism personally.  But, who cares?   This movie was very funny and I couldn't stop laughing.  And this is a different Kevin Smith because this is his longest movie (128 min.; his other films never went past two hours) and this is his bloodiest movie ever.  But, it's a Kevin Smith movie.  What do you expect?  Also, if there's a Catholic person reading this review, I apologize about the caring thing.  But, if you liked or loved this movie, then  it doesn't really matter.

I think I matured or something... I can't honestly explain why... I do have all of his films and do still like them! But there comes a time where you stop and move on!This is a really enjoyable film which suffered at the hands of the protesters... a shame because if the majority would have actually bothered to watch it first then they would realize that it wasn't the film they expected!Affleck and Damon team up well and 'Dogma' boasts Kevin Smith's best cast so far by a long stretch.

162,Zoopansick,Baffled at the postives,2,1 July 2003,"Ok first off my reason for not liking this movie is very simple.  It has nothing do with the possible offensiveness of the topic.  I'm not a religious person and therefore have no qualms with someone poking fun at the church.  My reason for not liking...errr hating this movie is due in part to 2 things.  1)It isn't funny and in fact is really really stupid. and 2)People seem to think that Kevin Smith is God.  He could make a movie in which there is no dialogue and the camera records paint drying on the wall, and people will love it if in one or two scenes Jay and Silent Bob walk by and Jay cusses and Bob nods his head or something.  It will be given a standing ovation on it's open night and a generation will preach of it's merrits and brilliance.  When I have talked to people about this movie (yeah I think now adays everyone my age (20) knows at least 1 or 2 die hard Kevin Smith fans) they say Kevin Smith is hilarious.  They don't really have specific reasons and just kind of go along with that assumption.  They sometimes will come up with ""he is original"".  Well so what. Originality is only a merrit if the movie is good or funny!  I mean there is nothing else like Dogma, but that is because no one else wants to make a movie as stupid as Dogma truly is.  It is another one of those movies filled with big names in small parts, trying to make up for it's numerous shortcommings in story and most of all jokes.  Alanis is prehaps the most obvious of these casting choices, but even Selma is wasted in her thankless role.  Yeah she is hot, but who cares that doesn't add anything.  The randomness of the movie is being defended as originality but I'm sorry if I must say that originality doesn't automatically make a good movie, and neither does Kevin Smith...automatically.Zoopansick",Dogma

I do give him points for tackling a novel subject. Well, it was new for him, anyway.In his diatribe against organized religion, Kevin Smith borrows, steals, cribs, and plagiarizes from every single stand-up comic, comic book, book, and newspaper op-ed piece that ever had anything remotely clever to say about the hypocrisy present in any hierarchical religion.

165,Stephen-12,Peculiar,7,20 January 2000,"Briefly...I've never seen a film that was so brilliant and so dreadful at the same time. Smith occasionally produces moments of utter brilliance, egRickman's deeply moving account of how he had to persuade the boy Jesus to take on his saviourhood;the subversion of the church's desire to become 'hip';the entire sequence with the mute God;the review of accepted Biblical content;the (under-explored) tension between Catholicism and abortion.In fact, it's when Smith becomes theological that the film succeeds, even if his standpoint is questionable. Unfortunately, the film as a film is a mess - too many characters, glib dialogue which throws away the jokes, clumsy editing, and a plot which seems to have been stitched together in a hurry. This looks like a half-finished screenplay, an early draft in need of trimming.Thank goodness, then, for the talent on offer: Linda Fiorentino's performance is robust and occasionally profound, and she carries the entire movie. Matt and Ben aren't given enough to do, and the film squanders their obvious talent. Rickman doesn't surprise, since he is usually splendid. Other characters can annoy more than produce enjoyment (Hayek, Rock, and particularly Mewes - this is my first Kevin Smith film, and I was sick of Mewes by the end, so God knows how all the people who've seen Amy and Clerks must think of him).I enjoyed the film very much, despite these flaws, but wish Smith had taken his time and put the script through some more re-drafts, because we might have had a masterpiece.

There was a big fuss made about this movie because of how religious it is but it is great. I do not take anything in Kevin's movies seriously, they are very funny and very well put together. This movie also leads into Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. At the end Jay says let go hang by the Quick Stop. Alanis Morrisette plays a very special role in this movie.

168,bhicks56,blasphemous?,9,5 December 1999,"I was really surprised about how uplifting this movie truly is, despite the hearsay of heresy going around. Think about it, what has been the truly religious film out this year? STIGMATA? END OF DAYS? Where they use religion like a B-movie?I am very tempted to say this movie was better than CHASING AMY. But it's hard to compare the two. Though it features alot of the same characters from AMY, and uses the same Kevin Smith elements as in all his movies (Jay and Silent Bob have the longest screen time than in any of the others), DOGMA uses a good chunk of special effects and violence, but surprisingly it doesn't ruin the film, though it comes to the verge.Linda Fiorentino was such a smart choice for her main role as the only one who can stop fallen angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) from re-entering Heaven and thereby proving God fallible and destroying everything living. It's confusing, I know, there's so many other things going on also. But don't fret, it's not MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE or CHINATOWN.You'd think you would be sick of seeing Ben Affleck and Matt Damon together again, but they work so well as Bartleby and Loki. Ben Affleck's character is the one that truly changes over the course of events, but I was surprised at how good of an actor Matt Damon is. For a long time he's played the same sort of characters, but here, he plays the sidekick masterfully (somehow his voice sounds different too).There's alot of characters and cameos in this movie, which I think is also different for Kevin Smith. Sure, he's always had a handful of slackers thrown in to keep the comedy flowing, but you were always paying attention to the main characters, which usually consisted of a guy, his oddball friend, and the one or two love interests. But here, due to the much more serious subject matter, we have an epic cast. George Carlin, Salma Hayek, Alan Rickman (seriously, folks!!), and Chris Rock all have important roles. Not to mention Jason Lee, who is menacingly good here, and cameos from Smith alumni Dwight Ewell and Brian O'Halloran.One more thing I would like to mention is Chris Rock. At first I thought he was going to be this hollering apostle using his usual black vs. white schtick comedy routine. Not to mention a bad actor (hopefully this movie will redeem him from CB4 and LETHAL WEAPON 4), but as the movie went on he conquered both hilarious and dramatic obsticles. He even came off as sweet a few times. This is his best appearance on film since the pork rib purchase in I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA!!I didn't know if I was going to like this movie at first. It sounded promising, but the trailers in the movie theater weren't too funny. But I think that was Smith keeping all the good parts behind the curtain (smart move). SEE THIS MOVIE!! The only thing that MIGHT be offensive, I thought, was Carlin's cigarette smoking, sell-out priest, but like the message in the beginning says (among other things) it's all a comedy fantasy!",Dogma

I saw it for the second time on cable the other night to see if I might like it better. Most of the performances are good especially Affleck and Damon. Chris Rock is a great comedian but a below-average actor. The movie is pretty muddled in its attempt to explain who all the various characters are and how they came to be. Slent Bob and Jay are very funny in small roles (i.e. Chasing Amy) but when they are given as much airtime as they are in Dogma, they grow tiresome pretty quickly.

172,vbz,Smith's worst yet,6,29 December 1999,"Indie darling Kevin Smith has been showing quite a lack of talent as of late: his films are getting progressively worse, in no small part due to their increasing length. This one, at two-and-a-half-hours is supposed to be a sharp religious satire, but Smith must have forgotten the golden rule of comedy: with few exceptions, anything over 90 minutes in duration ceases to be funny. Labeled as an attack on the Catholic Church, the movie gets muddled in its own politics and itself becomes preachy along the way. For the most part, the acting feels amateurish and sitcom-like, almost necessitating a laugh-track, while the few truly hillarious jokes are lost in the plot's thickness. By the end, ""Dogma"" begins to resemble one of those lumbering Biblical epics of the 50's (only in its modern incarnation for the cynical Generation Y) more than such irreverent celebrations of slackerism as ""Clerks"" and ""Mallrats"". Jay and Silent Bob, the duo left over from Kevin's last three flicks, contribute to the movie's few moments of what feels like comic relief, and when a comedy actually requires the later, it obviously needs some major fixing.",Dogma

175,Castor-5,An outstanding followup to Chasing Amy,10,12 November 1999,"Many people out there have seen the Kevin Smith films.  What started out with some extremely funny segments in Clerks and Mallrats.  Then Smith made a very true and honest film, Chasing Amy which was also hilarious but, as far as film wise, was much better than Clerks and Mallrats.  Now Smith gives us a true religious-comedy epic, Dogma.  And even with the big leap into special effects, big budget, and extremely high Catholic controversy, Kevin Smith still succeeds.Lots of fans have read the script which has been floating around the internet for a good two years now.  And quite a bit has changed with some of the scenes and dialogue but the plot stays very true to the draft we have read.  Our heros, Jay and Silent Bob, join Bethany and Rufus (Linda Fiorentino and Chris Rock) to stop renegade angels Loki and Bartleby (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) from getting ""looped"" back into heaven.  And there are other performers we have seen in past Kevin Smith films returning here, Jason Lee, Jeff Anderson and Ethan Surplee in a very unrecognizable role found here.  Oh, and lets not forget George Carlin and his ""Catholicism WOW!"" campaign at the beginning of the film.Like Chasing Amy, this is another very true film.  It's hilarious and often thought-provoking.  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck really prove themselves as outstanding actors here, we maybe used to seeing Matt Damon play very similar performances in Good Will Hunting and Rounders but we see a very more agressive and, yes, badass side to him here.  There scenes keep your attention throughout and when they aren't on camera Chris Rock and Alan Rickman do an excellent job.  But the best performances in the film are definatly Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith as always).  Every scene they are in they shine better than everyone else.  Silent Bob, although with only two lines, is just funny to watch his facial expresions and body language while Jay is just at his best and finest.However there are some problems with the film though.  Linda Fiorentino is absolutly one of the most boring characters ever in this film.  She plays Bethany so dull and even in important parts of the script between her and Metatron (Alan Rickman) she literally brings you to sleep.  The film could have been a tad bit shorter too since some parts really felt like they were dragging on for too long.  But as far as complaints go, those are really the only ones I have.Believe me though, this is a great film to see.  Four hours after seeing the first showing I wanted to go to a later showing the same day already. Unfortunatly all the later showings sold out but I'm already looking forward to seeing it again.  Kevin Smith is going beyond a cult classic and to the realm of a true film icon.  An outstanding followup to Chasing Amy.",Dogma

(It didn't register a single laugh at the showing I caught, and you're not going to find yourself quoting any lines from it to your friends.)  The ""good vs. evil"" plot, which is far-fetched even by fantasy standards, has to do with two fallen angels who are attempting to re-gain heaven through a portal in New Jersey. If they succeed, they will cause the end of all reality -- and they can only be stopped by this woman who works in an Illinois abortion clinic and who has been selected for this mission by God.  All of the theological background to this story is presented in endless expository dialogue, which when delivered by Alan Rickman, in a great performance as God's announcing angel, is riveting; but when delivered by the likes of Chris Rock and Salma Hayak, neither of whom shows any talent for acting, turns into boring drivel that you will find difficut to stay awake through, let alone understand (it didn't even sound like the actors understood what they were saying).  Two good performances by Matt Damon and Ben Afleck, who do what they can to energize this boring mess, are totally wasted.

It can be seen as bashing Christianity or it could be seen as looking at the Bible in a different light e.g. Jesus having younger brothers and sisters, God being a woman, Jesus being black and there being a black apostle. It can be seen as having an open mind to who God was and Jesus was.Its very funny and should not be taken too seriously. If you're one of those people who cant have a laugh, then don't bother watching this film. If you think this film exploits Christianity, then just think about how other religions have been exploited for the satisfaction of Christians (e.g. the ending of the Wicker Man) 10/10",Dogma
179,minnow-6,The only people that should find `Dogma' offensive are atheists.,6,2 August 2000,"`Dogma' **1/2. `History is about to be rewritten by two guys who can't spell... Time flies when you're having fun. Party on, dudes!' This is the tagline for `Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.' And, it could easily be the tagline for `Dogma.'  The similarities don't stop with the tagline. Bill and Ted's guide is Rufus, ditto Silent Bob's and Jay's guide.  Silent Bob and Jay are prophets sent to help Bethany (last known descendant of Christ) save the world.  The world, and all existence for that matter, is threatened by two angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) who've found a loophole in the God's plans.  Bethany has to get to the church in time to stop the angels before God is found fallible.  This excellent adventure follows Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), Jay (Jason Mewes), Rufus (Chris Rock), the voice of God (Alan Rickman), and a host of others as they cross America to save the world.  The acting is really good and there are a lot of laughs. A worthy rental. Oh yeah, the controversy about Kevin Smith's script being sacrilegious? I don't know what the Catholic Church has to complain about: in the end God's existence is affirmed, Jesus is proclaimed as the true son of God, and the Virgin birth is acknowledged as a biblical truth.  The only people that should find `Dogma' offensive are atheists.",Dogma
180,hitchs,Mindless garbage,1,22 September 2001,"It shocks and amazes me that so many talented actors allowed themselves to be mixed up in this execrable piece of cinematic trash.Contrary to what many others have said, the script goes out of its way to be offensive to the Catholic Church, but manages to do so by carefully avoiding any trace of originality. (Come on, you could scarcely be less original than the shock-horror revelation that God is female.) It basically rehashes every thoughtless criticism ever uttered by those who misguidedly think they know something about the Church, while apparently going out of its way to avoid saying anything intelligent. I was particularly impressed by the way the plot (poorly thought out though it is) has to stop every time someone wants to make an inane comment.Apart from that, the film boasts some of the most puerile jokes ever to make their way into a big-budget movie, as well as buckets of utterly pointless bad language. If Smith did any research for this film, I suspect it was taking a tape recorder into the boys' toilets at his local primary school.",Dogma
181,CalvinValjean,A Very Funny Movie That Speaks Loudly...But Sadly Has Nothing To Say,8,20 June 2011,"I've always had mixed feelings about Dogma, and I feel that the best way to sum it up is as follows: As a comedy, the movie is hysterical! It has some incredibly funny dialog, mostly delivered by Alan Rickman, Jason Lee, and Jason Mewes's characters. As an adventure movie, it has a very creative plot and keeps you hooked throughout its journey to its epic and apocalyptic conclusion.Where the movie fails and fails miserably is at being any sort of actual commentary on religion. Despite the many conversations about religion and dogmas held throughout the film...nothing all that ""deep"" is ever really said. The movie ultimately has a shallow message of ""God is cool. Just have a sense of humor and an open mind."" And this is a shame because Kevin Smith is clearly a bright guy who knows a lot about church history; he even claims in the closing credits that the film represents his lifetime's worth of religious reflection. You'd think he'd have said something a little more sophisticated.In fact, despite being somewhat controversial when it came out, the movie never really is all that shocking. Yes, I realize there are religious zealots out there who get ""offended"" by even the slightest things (Angels and prophets using curse words! Jesus having a 13th apostle! Jesus being black! God being a woman!). But with all due respect, none of those things are REALLY controversial. I would have liked the movie to have been deeper and delved into greater issues like: the possibility of God not existing, or Jesus having been an invented character, or exposing the corruption of the Catholic Church, or what about the role of Judaism and Islam? That would have given the film a lot more weight in my opinion.Fortunately, as I said, the movie is a lot of fun, and so I am able to sit back and laugh at what it offers. Rickman, Lee, and Salma Hayek all give the best performances. I do feel Linda Fiorentino is somewhat underwhelming; despite being the lead character, she frequently seems like the dullest thing in the film. I have heard that she and Smith did not get along, and maybe that affected why there seems to be so little to Bethany.Dogma is a very fun and entertaining movie, but alas, it's not very deep, despite what the director seemed to think of it. Listening to Kevin Smith on the DVD commentary track is almost sad; he talks about how he was disappointed the movie didn't get Oscar nominations. Well, here's why: BECAUSE YOUR MOVIE HAS A SCENE WITH A POOP MONSTER! Smith could have made a stronger, deeper film if he had really tried. Instead he just made a little comedy, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's a very good movie to laugh with; it's just not good for much more than that.",Dogma

It is so extreme with it's twisted premise, that you sit mesmerized in front of it and think ""Man, this is really a great movie.""  Great performances by all of the cast members.  Great scripting by Kevin Smith.  And great casting - George Carlin as the head of the Catholic Church (the most absurd thing I can think of), Alan Rickman as the voice of God (snide as ever with his eye-rolling and sharp accent), Affleck and Damon as Bartelby (sp?) and Loki were absolutely wonderful together as they always are.

From extensive text of the prologue to the footnotes of his afterwards, Smith parades his work as a wonder of wonders and then lives up to his claim.  No matter how much you've loved his work before prepare to be impressed. With the profane poetry of Clerks and Mall Rats through the laser sharp indictment of contemporary romance in Chasing Amy, Smith has continually astonished the viewer with unabashed lyric brilliance and sage humanist insight couched in outrageous hipster style . . . as a writer.  As a filmmaker Kevin Smith is still at best a hack; but he's learning and Dogma is by far his most ambitious and most successful work of cinema.  If only his movie was as good as his idea.",Dogma
184,conspracy-2,"Fresh, gutsy, funny, daring movie",8,20 May 2000,"It's wonderful when lesser-known directors and writers take a chance and send a different, daring, risky script to a producer, and the producer actually OKs it. It happened to 'Being John Malkovich', and the result is a fantastic, witty, deeply weird-but-fun movie.Dogma is not quite 'Being John Malkovich' on the old bizarre-o-meter, but it is probably more daring. It tackles spiky subjects like religion (well, christianity and especially Catholicism) with a grace and devil-may-care attitude, that I am surprised Christian Fundamentalists didn't burn down all the theaters it ran in. (Hey, don't scoff, christians in the past  have used fire to solve most any problem).The two angels, Loki and BBy, played by the dynamic duo #1, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, are wonderfully cynical and, well, human. They have got God by his metaphysicals, and they're not gonna let him go.The dynamin duo #2, the token Jay and Silent Bob, loosen up the atmosphere when it once in a while gets a little complentative and heavy (it has to happen in a film like this), so that, all the time in this movie, you feel happy and joyous, even though it's demolishing church dogma before your very eyes.The plot does seem to lose a little direction in places, and too much of the understanding of the film hangs on you knowing a lot about Catholicism and listening to every word of the Demon's speech in the bar. But that doesn't matter. It toys so elegantly with its subject matter, that it's worth seeing just for that.In conclusion, don't boycott this film or anything stupid like that. It's a fun flick, a comedy. It just touches on something uncomfortable. But, isn't that what all good comedies do?",Dogma
185,HulkVader,Another hilarious movie from Smith,9,15 September 2000,"Kevin Smith is an excellent writer, and a good director.  His acknowledgement of the ironic, absurd, or hypocritical is nothing short of brilliant.  This is not a movie for the faint of heart, or the easily offended, however.  The devoutly religious will probably despise this movie, though in most cases it would be difficlut to squeeze a needle into the closed mind typical of that sort.  The dialogue is written in Smith's familiar ""Jersey prose"", with plenty of obscenities, and if you find that language offensive, be warned.  All in all, this is a great movie.  Loosen up you sense of humor, open your mind, and laugh your ass off!",Dogma
186,jaysilentbob37,Kevin Smith is my favorite filmmaker. EVER.,8,9 December 2005,"Sure, his movies are really just a bunch of talking, but damn if they don't bring me more joy than half the movies I'm likely to ever see. Clerks was great, Mallrats was entertaining, Chasing Amy was perfect, and now comes Dogma. The word for this is... Perfect. Kevin Smith proves for the second time that he knows how to make a comedy hilarious, and thought provoking at the same time. Chasing Amy started out funny, and eventually, started making you think. The dialog in Dogma that makes you think, is all funny. It makes some daring, but really deep, and thoughtful points about religion, and makes you question God (in a good way).The film follows two angels, Bartleby (Ben Affleck), and Loki (Matt Damon). They have been banished from heaven a long time ago, and for the past 1000 years, have been stranded in a place far worse than hell... Wisconsin. Until one day, the Catholic church makes a new law. Anyone who passes through the arches at a particular church, shall be forgiven for all their sins, and given a morally clean slate. The angels see this as a loophole to sneak back into heaven. What they don't know, is that if they pass through the arch, they'll destroy existence.In desperation, unable to find God (Alanis Morrisette), the angel who speaks for God, the Metatron (Alan Rickman), summons the reluctant last descendant of Christ, Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), to track down and stop the angels from entering the church. She sets off on a quest, aided by two prophets, Jay (Jason Mewes), and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), and the 13th apostle, Rufus (Chris Rock). This is a long movie, but it's so darn entertaining, that you won't want it to be over when it is. Jay and Silent Bob, Smith's recurring characters, have their biggest role yet. It's also their funniest (until Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back). Jay is hysterical. He's the kind of guy who you think is awesome, but also needs to get his ass kicked. And Matt Damon has his best role ever, as Loki, the former angel of death. In one scene, he and Bartleby are discussing their upcoming mass genocide right in front of the gun store owner. They intend to punish the staff of a children's show called ""Mooby the Golden Calf."" They think the creators of the show are committing idolatry, but it's really just a fatal coincidence. This leads to the funniest scenes in the movie.The film always maintains it's light, comedic tone, even when the plot takes some rather serious turns. The blood-soaked finale proves to be one of the most suspenseful climaxes I've ever seen in a comedy, even if it does involve things like drunk angels, and Jay with a machine gun (don't ask). The film is often as thrilling and intense as Chasing Amy was sad and heart-wrenching. And any film maker who can combine those tones with such big laughs has to be a genius. Be warned though, Dogma is one of the most violent comedies I've ever seen. Though it doesn't ever seem to get acknowledged, the film contains surprisingly graphic stabbings, shootings, exploding heads, splattered... you get the picture. Squeamish beware. Also, screw the protesters, this is one of the most pro-God movie's I've seen. Though most bashers of this movie won't believe me, my faith really boosted when I saw this... maybe I'm alone, but I hope not.I award this show a full 10/10.

But, this film is extremely funny with Linda Fiorentino, Allan Rickman, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith all play off each other so well, that you actually do not worry about the language and sexual references.Chris Rock plays Rufus, the 13th apostle. His interaction with Linda, Jason and Kevin is hilarious at several times.Linda plays Bethany the last living descendant of Jesus Christ, of course she doesn't know it but the demon Azrael played by Jason Lee does know it.Every good movie needs a group of main characters, in this case there are two sets: Linda, Allan, Jason, Kevin and Chris who are trying to stop the second set of characters Ben and Matt who play angels who were cast out of God's heaven for not following orders.There is gore in this movie so beware, nothing like the horror flicks of today, but just that same there is much blood shown throughout the film.

While not a perfect movie, it is a hilarious statement on religion in the world today that doesn't get too preachy.It is a very witty film with an interesting take on organized religion. Excellent performances from Linda Fiorentino and Chris Rock.  My absolute favorites in the movie are Jay and Silent Bob!!! Don't worry all you folks who didn't see Clerks, Mallrats or some of Smith's other work.  While I'm sure there are a couple of inside jokes I missed, this film is a great independent work you will not feel lost.No Degrassi Jr. High references in this film but a couple of Star Wars and John Hughes referrals.Finally, my hat is off to Kevin Smith, not only for his wonderful performance as Silent Bob, but his guts for making this movie in the face of protest.  Thankfully, there has been no furor and people have had the opportunity to check this film out.  This movie isn't anti-catholic - it is anti- intolerence.

Chris Rock delivers his lines like he's in a nativity play at his pre-school... jay and silent bob are overused... come on Kevin, don't wear out your secret weapons!...there's some cheesy special effects, sight gags and some lightweight gore (just so Kevin can look like he hasn't lost his edge)... the odd jabs at religion are so inconsequential that it'll probably improve the church's image...for some reason i enjoyed Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's little part in the story, and i did laugh at the odd thing... but its cardinal sin is a weak script... say 20 snoochie boochies and 12 death stars tonight, Kevin!",Dogma

The only criticism I really have is that if you aren't Catholic, you won't get it.  Half of the jokes are Catholic bashing (which I'm all for having been raised in the horrifying tradition myself).  However, I saw it with a friend of mine who is Buddhist and the poor girl had no idea what was going on.  I suppose anyone in the judeo-christian tradition would understand it for the most part, but you really need to be familiar with Catholic dogma to get all the jokes.

The main thought this provoked in me is how quickly people assume that DOGMA must be hip and clever simply because it offends some reactionary section of the establishment. If it has anything of any consequence to say at all, it says it in a manner clumsy and dim-witted enough to be of interest possibly to twelve year-olds, but surely not to most intelligent adults. Comic-book characterizations and hammy acting (most notably Rickman's 'CARRY ON' style performance) don't automatically make a movie great just because it winds up some Catholics. The Church and its failings were satirized with a million times more wit, style, and substance in LIFE OF BRIAN.

Does this character in some way further the plot? I don't believe so. It's just Chris Rock doing his same old shtick.

199,dover,Straddling the fine line between good and great,9,12 November 1999,"Kevin Smith's latest effort, ""Dogma"", is certainly worth the money you'll pay to see it (well, as much as almost any other movie is).  It's not quite as good a ""Clerks"", but it's probably better than ""Mallrats"" or even ""Chasing Amy"".  This is Smith's first attempt at what could be termed an epic of sorts, and he pulls it off nicely.Most of the movie is very, very good.  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck do a great job as two fallen angels trying to get back to heaven.  Linda Fiorentino plays the confused Bethany.  Jason Mewes and Smith himself are the ""prophets"" Jay and Silent Bob.  Smith regulars like Jason Lee and Brian O'Halloran join newcomers like Chris Rock, Alan Rickman and George Carlin in a mostly excellent cast.The story here is intriguing.  There are a few convenient occurences, but the overall storyline in a generally interesting one.  The outcome (the end of the world) is treated as a real possibility, not just another big joke in a line.  The plot takes a number of turns, but ends up coming together with aplomb.There is some downside that prevents this from being a really great movie. For one thing, Salma Hayek's character (Serendipity) is completely superflous.  She seems to be included solely to catch her stripping on video.  Alanis Morissette as God is more about who Morissette is than who she's playing.  Other than that, there is a good balance of tension and comic relief throughout the movie that give it a real energy you don't often see.One thing that has to be mentioned is the Catholic uprising over the repeated knocks on the church in the movie.  It occurs to me that very, very few of the movies detractors could actually have seen the movie.  The ending (without giving away too much) is very much for the church, and the heroine is a Catholic.  While the arguments in the movie against the church may be old and tired, Smith proves the inherent hypocrisy of the church outside the theatres, as they boycott something on hype alone.  I find it amazing that I, a Jewish-raised athiest, am less offended by ""Dogma""'s pro-church ending than many Catholics.  The movie treats you as if you have an intellect, letting you decide if what happened is real, or if it's right.  Too bad the same can't be said of the Catholic church.All in all, a very enjoyable movie.  Definitely a further sign that Kevin Smith is a premier film-maker of his generation.",Dogma

It was an incredible mesh of the high-brow and the low-brow.It had one character who was extremely foul-mouthed, and kept making up hilarious obscene phrases. It also had a lot of perceptive, biting (and very funny) theological and social commentary.For me, it was sort of like being tickled hard in the ribs for about an hour.

Salma Hayek is better than her usual roles. In this movie she plays a smart muse, while in ""Wild Wild West"", she was a dumb ""muse"" (by the way, in WWW her talent was completely wasted). Jason Lee (Azriel-the devil), George Carlin (Cardinal Glick), Jason Mewes (non-stop talking Jay) and Chris Rock (Rufus-the 13th apostle) are doing great jobs and contribute enormously to the movie. Linda Fiorentino is perfect as the world's saviour and Alan Rickman (Metatron) gives a marvelous performance as a cynical angel (his scene concerning tequila drinking-and then spewing it back, and the extremely funny pants-down scene are very original). Ben Affleck and Matt Damon have lots of chemistry (that's not a surprise, we know how well they got along in ""Good Will Hunting"") and are competent as outcast angels Bartleby and Loki. But the real gem of this movie is Alanis Morissette. Though she does not say anything, her screen presence is overwhelming.

203,constructionbob,"No, I'm not the director/writer/star...",9,3 June 2000,"Actually, this is the first Kevin Smith film I've ever seen-and I quite enjoyed it.  Sure, some have remarked on the sloppy direction, but Smith self-admittedly is a better writer than director, and I thought things went fine.  The plot is fresh, the dialogue fresh (if more than a bit profane) and the characters are wacky as all get out.  Plus, it's pretty funny. 
I thought the Film Geek's review was dead-on when he said this was the best religious satire since Monty Python's Life of Brian, as the films have quite a bit in common.  Both take religion seriously enough that they're stable enough to joke about its foibles-and I appreciate that.  Good satire has its basis in truth, and desires to bring about change, and Dogma definitely accomplishes this.  I especially appreciate how earnestly it deals with the difficulty people have with relating to God.  Why do his plans so little coincide with our own?  Does knowing things are 'in his plan' make hardship any better?  And Metatron's exposition on having to tell Jesus what was in store for him is profound, and thought-provoking.  It's strange that all this works, along with a demon made out of excrement working into there somewhere...Many reviewers have said that the Catholic League is insane for boycotting this movie, as you will rarely find a greater proclamation of faith in film. I'd have to agree.  The only reason you might want to boycott this is if your faith is so small that you cannot question what you believe for fear it might disappear, or if you're prudish enough to dismiss it on the language and themes-which are admittedly juvenile in parts, but understandable.

One morning, a woman is awoken by Alan Rickman, who tells her she's some kind of Chosen One and must go on a quest. Okay, I'm sold!The dialogue is on the whole pretty funny. The message might be painfully obvious to anyone raised secular/liberal, but I think there's a bigger lesson to be learned that's not quite apparent. For instance, Bethany works in an abortion clinic and the plot doesn't punish her for it. She does get pregnant at the end, but she wanted a child before, and I can't see her job as resulting from frustration with her infertility. This movie demonstrates a tolerance for abortion that I haven't seen much in pop culture. Bethany is also in her 30s, usually an awkward age for a woman to be since you usually don't look virginal anymore and you might feel past your sell-by date. Hopefully characters like this might keep female audiences from being afraid of turning 30.Lots of movies with frequent strong language and sex talk sound immature because of it; in this one it's not at all gratuitous because of the sincere sentiment driving the story. After I first watched Dogma I was in the gladdest of moods--I even cried during the lake scene. Bethany is horrified to discover that she is the last descendant of Jesus. Metatron pulls her out of despair by telling her to be who she always saw herself as; not to feel limited because of the new label applied to her. She is ""a redefinition of that identity."" This exchange resonated on a deeply personal level with me, not because I'm a descendant of Jesus, but because I have high- functioning autism. For a long time I really wanted to be rid of this diagnosis--I am not Sheldon Cooper. But when I heard ""redefinition of that identity,"" a cloud lifted. I can't articulate how much it means to hear those words come from my favorite actor. A million thanks, Kevin Smith.",Dogma
205,Stroheim-3,"No Sacrilege, Just Boring",5,14 November 1999,"For months I've been hearing that some Catholic League is protesting Kevin Smith's DOGMA for its sacrilegious quality; of course these people have not seen it.  What else is new?The fact remains that it is neither sacrilegious nor anti-Christianity - it is actually Smith's journey towards spiritual enlightenment.  It is his justification of religion; he manages to find God in the modern world.  And he does this brilliantly.  Unfortunately, this is all he does well.The script was filled with cheesy-one liners that seem to come from a novice's screenplay.  Many of the jokes are forced.  Then again some of them are absolutely hilarious, but these are few and far between.  Moreover, the film is boring.  The middle hour and twenty minutes suck.  I hated being forced to listen to poorly written discourse about religion and the dumb jokes about what really happened in the Bible.  Plot holes?  Yes I'll have some.  Maybe it was the editing; I don't know, but people just appeared out of nowhere and stuff happened that wasn't followed up upon.  For example, Azrael established a base of operations and then didn't do anything with it.  Why?The acting wasn't fabulous either.  Jason Lee was overly dramatic in his role, Chris Rock played himself, and Jason Mewes seemed drastically out of his element.  Even Alan Rickman seemed to be struggling.Again some of it was hilarious, and the message was good.  That was it.  In a word: BOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooring!!!",Dogma
206,FatPhil,Clash of the Titans without the Medusa,6,2 February 2003,"The religious theme to this film is irrelevant. One fairy story, the Christian mythology, deserves as much entertaining screen-time as any other fairy story, such as Greek mythology. 
Anyone who thinks this film provides any new insight into any argument concerning ontology is one book short of a testament. It's just a comic-book story with some novel super-heroes. Enjoy it for what it is. I was laughing almost solidly for the first half of the story! I stopped laughing half way through, and later I worked out why - Alan Rickman was missing. His camp (over camp, he spoils it sometimes) role as Gods messenger, glues the fairly thin plotline together. Chris Rock comes in second place for his faultless job of keeping the movie on its toes. The choice made for God was abysmal, but fortunately God's on-screen for very little time at all, so it doesn't matter much.
The film makes digs at lots of people and _lots_ of films - some directly some indirectly. Look out for the Karate Kid reference - that's why I think Rickman _makes_ this movie.
Probably the best Smith I've seen, but that's not saying much - all of the other ones I pretty much loathe.

207,savagesteve13,I was lost for 95% of the movie.,3,17 August 2007,"I guess if you are religious you can at least follow the events to some degree. It is some sort of retelling of biblical events but on earth and with movie stars you recognize. It seems the director has a thing against Catholicism so I guess he's protestant. Smith manages to get some seriously major actors in this flick. Short but sexy Salma Hayek is worth the price of admission alone, and Jay and Silent Bob are their usual entertaining selves. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are the two prettiest metrosexuals I've ever seen. Its got lots of biblical stuff, aka mass murders, flames, apocalyptic visions and of course angels that are as smooth as Ken Dolls ""up front"", and Jay and Silent Bob running their mouths off endlessly (well Jay anyway...).If you are secular give this movie a miss, and rent ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"", a much more successful comedy.The movie ""Prophecy"" starring Christopher Walken is a bit better telling the story of warring angels on earth, complete with black comedic elements but without the rather lame contrived jokes.",Dogma
208,mikeg994,"God, Angels, Wisconsin and Unruly Toilets",10,23 August 2008,"I enjoyed this film thoroughly and was barely aware that it was 2 1/2 hours long. I expect viewers with no familiarity with the bible and/or fixed ideas about religion will find this film highly offensive. For the rest of us, who are going to heck anyway, it was a delightful comedy. Smith takes on God, angels, unruly toilets, and Wisconsin. As with most Kevin Smith films, New Jersey figures in there somehow. In Kevin's world, heaven suffers many of the same problems that humans face in the modern world. Things go to hell while the boss is away, and boy do they go to hell. First the Catholic church decides to update its image as though it hired an ad agency creating the ""Buddy Christ"", then a priest (George Carlin) makes his church doorway a gateway to get into heaven free. It never occurs to him that two fired angels Bartleby and Loki, banished to Wisconsin by God, would take advantage of this loophole. And while they are at it they go on a rampage by killing people on buses and in one memorable scene almost the entire executive staff for a major corporation.For some reason the ""last scion"" of Christ, is an infertile and bitter fallen away Catholic woman (Linda Fiorentino) working in an abortion clinic. And for reasons only dimly revealed is needed to stop Loki and Bartleby from taking advantage of the New Jersey church loophole. This is a mission she is sent on by the Metatron, (Alan Rickman). One of the funniest parts of the movie is when Alan Rickman's character appears in Fiorentino's bedroom as the flaming voice of God only to be doused with a fire extinguisher.Jayson Blair and Kevin Smith, who have appeared in just about all Smith's films since ""Clerks"" are inevitably part of the action. They serve as the helpers in this quest to get the last scion to New Jersey in time. Blair plays the typically foul mouthed stoner whose only goal in life seems to be to get laid, and goes about it in the most unsubtle and foul mouthed way possible. Smith as always plays ""Silent Bob"" and while thankfully not as foul mouthed, being silent, is almost as clueless as Jay.All in all a splendid time will be had by all, except for those who have no sense of humor, no sense of the absurdity of much religious tradition, and those who think that excrement has no place in the pantheon of humor. Such people of course are just wrong.",Dogma
209,Filmfan-NL,"Nice cast, few good laughs, weak story... Back to work!",6,26 July 2001,"What I liked about this movie is the cast. Ben and Matt are believable as fallen angels, I just LOVED Alanis Morissette as God (I'd wanna believe in HER alright, what a bright happy face. She made me forget my sorrow for a while) and Chris Rock (hitherto unknown to me) was funny as the Apostle. Hayek was acceptable, those two dweebs the prophets- could have been missed I guess, but Metatron (alan Rickman) is hilarious.The story however is very weak, and the production far from impressive. But hey, apparently without the millions films cost these days you can't expect all that much. I had quite a good time though, and luckily the film did not stoop to the Naked Gun type of humour, as the Buddy-Jesus joke in the beginning seemed to promise. I am glad I watched it on video and didn't spend money on a cinema ticket for this one.Possibly people with a religious background will see more in this film and enjoy the way religion is portrayed here, but for me -poor atheist- no such luck. :)SPOILERIn short the main story is this: two fallen angels want to go back to heaven, but cannot. Then the Catholic church in New Jersey initiate a plan to get more people back in church. Anyone who comes to the church on a given day will be granted general pardon for their sins. The two aim to be pardonned too, in order to go to heaven when they will have changed to their human forms afterwards and made sure they die. Problem is that by so doing, they'll prove God's infallability wrong which will lead to extinction of creation in total. So God sends for a rescue mission, His Voice (HER) descends to earth, finds a girl who later proves to be related to christ, and instructs her to prevent the two from entering the church. Two prophets will help her, and along the way the 13th Apostle and Serendipity (hayek) join them. Bla di bla and so forth. The two get help from Lazarus and his evil knievels who is pissed off with God and rather ceases to be than go back to hell. So in the end, a big shoot'm all up, God is found just in time, she pads Bartleby on tha back, screams him to death and saves all. In the mean time girly is knocked up by divinity and thus we'll be able to perhaps watch part II some timeIt won't be remembered long I guess, it has a few good laughs, and it's fun while it lasts.  Only it lasts a bit long for such a small storyline, IMHO. So 6 out of 10, and back to work.",Dogma

Even Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith were no good in this one.The script is just terrible. I'm a big Kevin Smith fan, but almost every line in this one is cringe-worthy, and especially those said by Linda Fiorentino.The whole story is just a jumbled mess--it seemed very much made up on the fly as they went along.And wow is it long. And boring. And not even a little funny.This film seems to be trying to be a critique of organized religion on some level, and so, I want to make it clear that I am not saying negative things out of some loyalty to some religion. I'm not a religious nut--just the opposite. I'm completely nonreligious. Religion is the single strangest thing about humanity, to me.I have no understanding of any positive thing that's been said about this film.

They were all pretty fleshed out, and played to perfection{Ben Affleck just ruled..I couldn't believe it..the guy came, saw, and went crazy with his part, and ruled]. There is so much to this film. The little tidbits we get through out the film are fun, and give it even more flavour. The only true problem I had was with Jason Lee, who's character really wasn't anything but a snappy dressed, over confident demon, and it didn't work for me. I am planning to see the film again. The plot I won't go into, but it involves a lot of scheming and planning by its main characters. Roger Ebert once said in a review for Jackie Brown:I could watch these characters scheme and plan for hours. That's how Dogma is.

I'm glad boring New Jersey has added someone to Hollywood. With ""Dogma,"" Smith proves he knows what he's doing. Although, his only other film I've seen is ""Clerks,"" I found it both original and hysterical. ""Dogma"" is a very smart comedy that focuses on the problems with Christianity today. It doesn't attack the religion, but rather points out that it has become less effective and meaningful to people. It criticizes the ways in which people have misinterpreted it.""Dogma"" is a story of two angels, thrown out of heaven ages ago for disobeying God. The two, Loki and Bartleby, decide that they no longer wish to stay on earth and plan to return home. With the discovery of a loophole in a New Jersey Church, their quest is possible. However, should they be successful in their return to heaven, the will of God would be defeated and the world would cease to exist. This provides for a very interesting story. ""Dogma"" sees the return of Jay and Silent Bob who have appeared in each one of Kevin Smith's movies. They are funny once again. The film features great writing and several interesting dialogues. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are great together as the two fallen angels. Linda Fiorentino, a non believer, is chosen as the world's savior and Chris Rock plays the 13th apostle. This becomes a very interesting situation. Each person attempts to impose his beliefs on another. The conversations are both entertaining and humorous. Serious talk about religion is mixed in with swearing and joking producing colorful dialogue. Although it is mostly conversation, the film fascinated me and kept me interested. Kevin Smith shows that he can not only talk about things in an interesting way, but also that he can talk about very interesting things.The only problem that I had with the film is the ending. I don't know why, but I just found it not as satisfactory as I thought it might be. There's nothing wrong with it in particular, but I might have been expecting something more spectacular. I also thought that at times the characters seemed to talk about religious facts endlessly. It was as if they would just stand aside and break away from the flow of the film simply to discuss some element of Christianity. Nevertheless this is a very funny and colorful film. A smart comedy that thrives on clever jokes and conversation while focusing on an intelligent topic. Overall an 8 out of 10.",Dogma

Not much, except to say that I laughed throughout the film, and left with a smile on my face and maybe a little bit more hope and yes, faith, than when I walked in.Kevin Smith is not a genius, but he is an unusually distinctive filmmaker, particularly these days.  That he has chosen to move beyond his self-imposed New Jersey regionalism is heartening, and though he may not have all of the pieces in place yet (the feces-demon was funny but left a sour taste afterwards; wasting Jason Lee in a tangential role is poor judgment) he deserves credit for even attempting something this much more grandiose than all of his previous three films put together.  The casting is wonderful, even though I'm still wondering what Salma Hayek's Serendipity was doing in the story at all.  Alanis Morissette's walk-on is surprisingly moving (and not a bit blasphemous, in case you were wondering). Even George Carlin does an admirable job at sticking to his character rather than mocking it.  The flaw which grated on my nerves the most was some highly excessive gore in two scenes, which give the movie an undertone of ugliness that it certainly doesn't need.Incidentally, I saw this film on opening night in this rather conservative Christian community, and nary a protester to be found!  Could it be that they might have realized their utter folly in choosing to attack a movie that so vividly argues for the existence of God (and makes the idea so absolutely appealing)?

220,Kilroy-17,Snoochie Boochie...,8,15 November 1999,"What a fun movie!  Of course, how could it not be?  The return of Jay and Silent Bob almost guarantee that.  Kevin Smith has given us another really entertaining and original film that not only gets you laughing, but examines religion and pokes fun at it in a way that is not mean-spirited.  Even still, because of the catholic jokes and the references to Christ and God and so forth, there are disclaimers at the beginning of the film to diffuse any protests and that kind of garbage.But the moment George Carlin appears as a Cardinal, you know, without a doubt that the picture is a comedy.  The funniest things in life are truths anyway.  Besides, after Life of Brian and Last Temptation of Christ, there's not much anyone could do to tick off religious types.After their repeated cameo appearances in Smith's previous films, Jay and Silent Bob finally are two of the central characters. They're heroes. Prophets of God if you can believe it.  The characters are not developed any more than you've known them before, you just get more of what is good about them, and you can't go wrong there.Matt Damon and Ben Affleck play angels who have been exiled from the kingdom of God, and by a decree of Cardinal Glick (Carlin), a loophole has been created that will allow them to return to heaven in spite of God's decree that they are permanently banished.  Because God is infallible, their return would show God to be in error and cancel out all existence as it is known.Linda Fiorentino plays Bethany, who is the one who is chosen to stop the two angels from returning to heaven, and off we go.Chris Rock is his usual explosive self as Rufus, the 13th apostle who was written out of the Bible because he was black.What all this makes for is a hilarious picture that is simply pure entertainment.  For fans of Kevin Smith, there is much more of what you like about his pictures.  Of course there's lots of new stuff.  But there's also references to old stuff and even things clearly lifted from other movies like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.  In one scene, Jay tells Loki (Damon) ""...one time this tubby bastard was on a rope in the mall...crashed thru a wall...""

222,cdimdb,"Fun, but with a dodgy underlying theme",5,16 April 2005,"The difficult part of any fantasy or SF is getting the /context/ in which the story operates - without loads of tacky explanation, voiceovers, or 'It is a time of war'-type crud in the opening credits. Which is why using a religious theme is such a slick device: everyone /knows/ the context, and the author gets a very wide stage in which all manner of weirdness is allowed to take place (dead people rising; guys with wings; supremely unpleasant villains, etc.) So I didn't have any problem with the religious context of 'Dogma', despite my being a militant, bible-burning, fundamentalist atheist (snarl, gnash). It set up the back-story neatly, allowing the audience to concentrate on the novel elements - sweary angels, black Jesus and all. The result was a very enjoyable and funny film.My problem was with the fact that this was also a very devout film, from an author who obviously believes deeply in god, and whose occasional criticisms of Catholicism were entirely the viewpoint of someone who thinks the formal Church has strayed from the path of True Righteousness. It's his opinion that God could just as easily be a short, cute girly who does hand-stands for fun.On the face of it this is a harmless enough notion, but in reality it's a pretty dangerous one, and ironically little different from the 'Buddy Jesus' concept: out with the forbidding, hairy, OT thunderer; in with the more sympathetic character, be it grinning muscleman or playful chicky. It's quite possible that this piece of rank goalpost-moving would have the effect desired by Cardinal Glick - drawing in new converts who would find the cuddlier deity more attractive.

For a movie featuring his usual dick jokes and even a monster made of fecal matter, the story is very well-written and original.The characters are great and fun to watch as most of Smith's characters are. Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and Loki (Matt Damon) make a very good team as the two angels expelled from heaven looking for their way back in. Their chemistry is flawless and their dialogue balances well between funny and dramatic.It may sound strange but I think Smith managed the drama better in this movie than he did in Chasing Amy (which I felt was a weak point in that movie). Dogma is a comedy but it has a lot of interesting things to say that aren't necessarily humorous. Most of the characters handle their dramatic moments pretty good, yet not forgetting the comedic nature of the film.Linda Fiorentino, Alan Rickman, Chris Rock and Salma Hayek are also well-written characters that compliment well as the ""good guys"" against the two angels. Jason Lee is superb in a limited but memorable role as the demon Azrael. Jay & Silent Bob are, well, Jay & Silent Bob.Dogma is a very interesting movie and a very funny movie.

At times, Smith appeared to be beating the Catholics over the head with the same message.  While I'm no fan of dogma or organized religions, I thought a more subtle approach would have been more entertaining and more effective.  There were times where you could just about see Kevin lecturing (preaching) through the dialog of the actors. It was OK for a Pay-per-view evening, but I wouldn't put any more effort into watching the movie than that.  Kevin Smith is a real talent.  However, I think his youth worked against him here.  If this movie were a wine, I'd say it needed about ten more years.",Dogma
232,rejoefrankel,"Smith's Dogma a jumble of the absurd, the obscene, and the spiritual?",2,29 November 1999,"Normally a fan of the gleefully outrageous Kevin Smith, DOGMA has neither the lowbrow knee slapping charm of CLERKS nor the emotional resonance and poignancy of CHASING AMY.  What is left instead is an awkward jumble of philosophical ideas, which would have been more interesting if it had been presented in either a dramatic form, or one that was purely comedic. Instead DOGMA is a painfully obvious mess, pitting seemingly sincere religious sermons against Smith's typical lowbrow cutesy gags.  The editing is apallingly discontinuous for a major studio film.  The violence is inexplicably graphic, not to mention unfunny.  The normally wonderful cast including Alan Rickman, Linda Fiorentino, Chris Rock and Ben Affleck are all but undone by the material.  DOGMA is a poor attempt at religious satire, or is it really about the need for religion in modern life?  Or is it actually about nothing at all, except Kevin Smith's reluctance to grow up as a filmmaker.  The film exists somewhere on the boundary between good and bad taste, serious message film, and bawdy farce, without making any commitment to the sides that it exploits.",Dogma

Jay and Bob are fantastic with their little stoner quips.The plot is fairly weak, but it's not supposed to be brilliant. It's easy to tell that Kevin Smith just enjoys playing around with Catholicism by poking and prodding at it.Also, George Carlin is what was his usual comedic self in his cameo.",Dogma

If you're not the one that can take ""isms"" lightly -- in this case sarcasm, symbolism, criticism, witicism -- then why bother watching?But if you can watch a movie objectively and listen to the point of view it's taking, you'll be at the very least by Dogma's very original look at the Catholic church and what drives the followers of Catholicism (and for those of you out there that think Smith is a heathen, be aware that he is Catholic, goes to church every week pays his tithe on a weekly basis).And if you were already fan of any of the original Jersey Trilogy (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy), you'll be delighted by Dogma.

Dollar Jr and Benny Hinn are probably on the idiot box about.... now.For anyone still with me, this film is just brilliant.  Forget the minor inconsistencies in plot and religious detail, this film manages to do several things and does them well.It gives the concept of organised religion and the things it advocates and those that are done in its name a well-timed, well-aimed boot up the clacker.  It points a finger at the stupidities, the ridiculosities and the absurdities of religion and does it oh so well.But ultimately it says, 'Hey, when you strip away the veneer and the accoutrements, there really is an underlying truth and a message that transcends all the window-dressing and embellishment that's worth bending an ear in the direction of'.For the record, I'm agnostic and DO NOT bend an ear that way, but I really respect the fact that Smith added that reverent touch.Do yourself one hell of a favour and see this film, ideally with a very open mind.P.S.

236,scoopcc,What aspects of this movie are so upsetting? (Miramax=foolish),7,12 November 1999,"Man, was I surprised when the ""controversial"" movie Dogma hit the screen and there was nary a moment of blasphemy. The dialogue in this movie mirrors the conversations that several level-headed, reverent Catholics and Christians have shared around and with me. No pentagrams on our family dinner table; there is honest, open discussion and topics in this movie are not picketed outside our house.Beyond the controversy stirred up outside the theater lies a roaringly funny movie inside. Smith is able to put together an interesting story line full of humorous lines as well as some developmental dialogue to keep the story moving along. On a couple of occasions the feel got a bit preachy (particularly during the train scene) and a few minutes probably could have been shaved off the final running time, but all in all, it's a good ride.Fiorentino gives a fine performance as a woman confused by her faith and even further confused by the mission her faith sends her on. Damon and Affleck did a bang-up job as the renegade angels; they were a welcome presence on the screen. Jason Mewes takes the cake for inducing humor, mainly because his toilet talk is a real contrast to much of what is spoken here. Silent Bob is nearly as funny with his facial expressions.It was nice to see Jeff Anderson back on the big screen, but he barely opened his mouth -- a travesty for Randal Graves' fans. Jason Lee also (surprisingly) suffered from an underwritten part, but he did well with the little time he had. George Carlin and Bud Cort also took advantage of their small roles. And Alanis wasn't bad.Nothing spectacular about the filming of this one, but as always, it's the characters that make Kevin Smith's movies sing. Fearing letdown on my way in, I left the theater thinking that: a.) what in the world was there to protest?; b.) the movie only dragged twice, which wasn't bad for a movie running 125 minutes; c.) Smith did a great job piecing together a complex story line while (here's the key part) keeping the shock value limited to Jason Mewes' mouth. And how surprising is it to hear Jay talk about getting' with the women?Shame on Miramax for cowering away from such a great film. I hope Lions Gate sees a decent return on this, and I hope the Weinsteins continue to wimp out on good films so we no longer have to endure their Oscar campaigning. A 7/10, losing some points for the two slow moments and preachy dialogue by Chris Rock at one point.",Dogma
237,TomC-5,an interesting and intelligently philosophical comedy,8,26 November 1999,"Kevin Smith's earlier movies CLERKS and CHASING AMY each offer us an underlying moral/philosophical core. For instance, along with some wonderfully effective ribald humor, told through the story of slacker icons Dante and Randall, CLERKS manages to pose such questions - familiar to any who have set through a semester of Philosophy 101 - as ""what is freedom?,"" ""what is duty?,"" and ""does man have an essential nature?."" In addressing such universal questions through some rather particular characters and situations, Smith can perhaps be seen as a truly contemporary American version of the European auteur, i.e., a worthy successor to such trailblazers as Bunuel, Fellini, and in particular, Bergman (albeit, one with pee pee and caca jokes - though Fellini could also get rather lowbrow). If DOGMA, Smith's most ambitious film to date is any indication, his clear intelligence, honesty, and originality are such that he may eventually come to rank among the great directors in cinema history.While not without its flaws, DOGMA is very much worth seeing (and thinking about afterward). In a nutshell, DOGMA tells the story of two fallen angels (played by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) who have a plan to get back into heaven; the only catch is that in carrying it out, they would negate all existence. In order to stop them, a rather lapsed (though still ritualistic) Catholic (Linda Fiorentino) is summoned by God herself (Alanis Morrissette) via a heavenly messenger (Alan Rickman) to prevent the fallen pair from carrying out their plan. More help is offered to her by both Chris Rock as a wisecracking 13th apostle (who says of Christ (who here happens to be Black) ""the nigger owes me money"") and the ubiquitous (and scene stealing) Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself). Structured like a comic book action tale, DOGMA manages to offer both comedy and some rather thought provoking reflection along the way on the nature of faith in general and on faith via adherence to Catholicism in particular.Not all of the comedy works; some of the humor feels a bit strained; but when the movie is funny, it is very funny indeed (including in both the opening credits and in a much deserved and not altogether veiled attack on the hypocrisy of the Disney corporation (which cowardly refused to distribute this film)). Fans of Smith's earlier works will also appreciate the occasional references back to these. At times, the story line became somewhat infocused. In general, however, the focus was there.As far as being an intelligent reflection on faith, I believe that this comes directly from Kevin Smith the person, a person who sees both the good and the elements of absurdity of organized religion.",Dogma
238,Rick_Terminal,Not for the easily offended (and neither is this review),9,22 October 2005,"First off, I want to apologise if my beliefs (or non-beliefs) offend anybody at all. This film is based in Catholicism, and so some degree of offence is bound to happen no matter what you do.So, let me get this out of the way; I despise the Catholic Church. I despise the way it tries to control people. I despise it's bloody place in history. I despise what it did to my family and what it would have done to me if my mother had not had the guts to stand up to our local paedophile priest in protest of my very own right to exist. I'm sure you get it, I do not approve of the faith.However, not everybody who is Catholic has such a bad experience. But they are willing to joke a bit. Forward this film.It's almost like an update of Catholicism. Did nobody realise Jesus was black? Study your bible, for God's sake! There are so many digs in this film it is incredible. It's almost like someone finally pointed out that Jesus was born in October, not December. Halleluiah! (Christmas is held on a pagan festival date, set by the Romans in early Briton. So was the may pole, the harvest, and a lot of other crap we now regard as Christian) So, I like this film for cutting through the nonsense and taking the mick out of all the traditional and superstitious nonsense our former world runners needed us to believe.Believe in God, yes. Believe the hype? NO!.",Dogma
239,jacob-l-williams,Brilliantly funny religious satire,9,30 June 2010,"Dogma is a film which is made for the sole purpose of highlighting the absurdities of religion and people blind faith in God. It does this through the use of comedy and what can only be called blasphemy of Christianity.The film claims Jesus was a black man but the people who translated the Bible where racist, it also claims God to be a woman and that the same people are sexist. However the way in which it makes these claims is in a way so absurd that I think its nearly impossible for anyone to be offended, it is not meant to be harsh on religious people it is merely Kevin Smith's way of exploring the subject of religion in a comic way.The acting in the film is all good, but director Kevin Smith as Silent Bob, and Alan Rickman as the Metratron are the two stand outs, even though Rickman only has about two minutes on screen, and Smith says all of two words.Many of the funniest moments in this film are stolen from other films for example when Silent Bob throws Loki and Bartleby off the train looks at the passengers and says 'No Ticket.' I instantly knew it was the same joke used in one of the Indiana Jones films although I can't remember which one, however this doesn't matter I knew the joke sure but in the new context it still made me life, particularly as this was the first and only line Silent Bob has in the entire film.The only let down of the film is perhaps the sub-plot of the Jason Lee as the evil Azrael is a little under-developed and amongst everything that was going on I kind of forgot about him until his showdown at the end with the Holy Bartender joke which is hilarious.Dogma is a fantastic film with good performances, a great script and unlike many of other comedies something to say about society. If you want to have a good laugh at God and the Bible then definitely watch this film; if you are a religious fanatic then perhaps watch something else as this could be very offensive.9/10",Dogma

Whether it is meant as a comedy or a really heavy message about religion is beside the point.Having seen earlier films by Kevin Smith (Clerks, Mall Rats, Chasing Amy), I was skeptical about the large scope of this film and its potential pretentiousness. But Dogma takes the best of the dialogue, cheapness, and fable from the previous films, adds an excellent music score, and takes hold of your attention for the entire time.Angels find a loophole created by the Catholic Church that will allow them to re-enter Heaven at the price of negating existence. Bethany (Linda Fiorantino) is charged with stopping them, and meets several Biblical characters along the way to bolster her waining faith. Match Chris Rock (the 13th Apostle) with Jay and Silent Bob, and an adventure of epic proportions is born.A must see.",Dogma
241,Bill-276,Takes itself too seriously too!,5,22 November 1999,"I'll give this film credit for one thing--it is a ground-breaking movie in it's attack of blind faith. However, being ground-breaking or different doesn't necessarily mean it's good. This is Kevin Smith's best film by far although I don't think that's saying much. My problem with the movie is the same problem the movie has with religious activists: STOP TAKING YOURSELF SO SERIOUSLY!! ""Dogma"" doesn't quite know whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama and being stuck in the middle really kills the point. Had this been an all tongue-in-cheek comedy, it would have been great. But it gets caught up in trying to make sense out of it's own myth while it's making fun of the nonsense of every other biblical allusion, and the movie ends up contradicting itself in this way.The second point I'd make about it is IT'S WAY TOO LONG! Cut out some material. I don't care if you make the plot ridiculous or complex (that's religion). But by the end you feel like you've been preached at not to preach. It's like telling somebody they need to lighten up while you're smoking a cigarette and popping a valium on two hours of sleep. You look like a hypocrite.I will say that Smith has finally learned a little bit about subtlety, but he's a long way from using it consistently. The ""When are we going to f**k?"" jokes are so tired in his movies. That was about 45 minutes of this film. Cut it out! PLEASE!! You had something to work with on this one and you blew it. I will say the acting was great. Affleck, Damon, the whole cast. It's particularly tough trying to deliver some of Smith's dumb-downed, gen-x insulting, overdone cliché references too. The cast did a great job with what they had to work with. But overall it was a great idea with a poor, ill-conceived script. I can't wait for his NEXT film though and I can't believe I'm saying that.",Dogma

244,jaylewis-2,thought provoking,9,17 November 1999,"I find it disturbing that anyone is closed-minded enough to be offended by this movie even before they have seen it. At the theater where I saw this movie, there were picketing protesters calling this film Anti-Catholic and Anti-God. This is religious satire folks. It is supposed to be taken with a grain of salt. Among the complaints against this movie, the main one was the character Bethany, a Catholic who works in an abortion clinic. That was inserted in the film for its absurdity. It depicts a woman who does not know any more where her faith is. She, like so many, attends church out of obligation. She doesn't really know what she believes any more, though. Hence, she feels no guilt in that her Catholic faith and her job conflict. The film was not in any way trying to make a statement about abortion. Some great works of literature are religious satire, and they are still read and studied at high schools and universities without this kind of c**p from ignorant protesters. What I find most ironic is that by protesting this film, many Catholics are proving the point that the movie makes. They are blindly following their church without weighing the facts themselves (i.e. see the movie before you complain about it).Enough on the topic of ignorance, though. This is supposed to be a review.I found Dogma to be outrageously funny and thought provoking. However, it was a bit slow, and I found the last scene depicting God as a ditzy young woman to be pretty stupid. Kevin Smith's script is brilliant, though. As is made evident by Chasing Amy and Clerks, Smith has a flair for combining slapstick comedy with raw philosophical discussion. Mallrats was strictly comedy, but it was quite good as well. The film's funniest moments include Matt Damon's overly dramatic executions of sinners. He has some great one-liners in these scenes, particularly the one in the conference room. Silent Bob and Jay steal the show, though. When they first appeared, the audience in the theater where I saw Dogma erupted in applause. You can't even look at them without laughing. Chris Rock was great as the thirteenth apostle, omitted from the bible because he was black. His comic talent was underused, though. Another character that I wish I had seen more of was Jason Lee as the demon Azrael. Lee stole the show in Mallrats, but his comic ability was missing in this movie. Overall, this film is an outstanding religious satire that raises some very important questions about faith. Do Christians follow God or do they just follow their church? I think that the response from the Catholic church to this movie shows that far too often it is the latter choice. However, Smith himself is Catholic. By making this movie, I believe he is presenting a challenge to his fellow Catholics to do more thinking on their own. I give this movie an 8/10 because of the poor ending. Were it not for that, it would get a 9 or even a 10. However, it's definitely worth seeing whatever your faith. You'll find yourself questioning the strength of your faith and laughing uncontrollably at the same time. 8/10",Dogma

Without going into any spoilers, the whole plot will be more comprehensible if you have some familiarity with Catholic teachings, but a general knowledge of Christian lore will probably be enough to enjoy the film.  It does contain some windy dime store philosophy, but I don't think it really gets in the way too much. Writer and director Smith has a real knack for writing dialogue and creating some amusing situations.  Even if they are occasionally predictable, it somehow didn't bother me as such things usually do. Zealots should steer clear, but I recommend it to all others.",Dogma
246,mreisman,"Come on, Kevin, grow up",3,7 February 2000,"Kevin Smith has got to feel pretty lucky.  Who else has made a career not only in spite of, but perhaps because of, such sloppy filmmaking?  At least you could excuse the poor acting and wordy, precious dialogue of ""Clerks"" as the efforts of a low-budget rising indie filmmaker.  For all of its flaws, it was a charming, fun movie, with memorable lines and Hey-I-know-guys-just-like-that! realism to it.But years later, with a major league budget, Smith is making many of the same mistakes, and nobody is telling him it's wrong!  ""Dogma"" is just as verbose and self-satisfied, the characters are just as thinly drawn, and even the best of Hollywood actors (Matt Damon!  Linda Fiorentino!  Alan Rickman!) can't keep the pace from plodding.  Particularly annoying was Kevin, his own cutesy, camera-mugging self as ""Silent Bob"" -- his inability to see his own overacting (in a mute role!) pretty much personifies the lack of awareness and discipline of ""Dogma"" as a film.  I am appalled that so many people have such allegiance to Kevin Smith because of a soft spot for comic-book/pop-culture references.  It's one thing to like a guy for liking the same movies you do; it's another to confuse it with an understanding of the craft itself.As you can tell, this movie actually makes me a little angry in retrospect. But while I was watching it in the theater, the strongest feeling I had was boredom.  The story was flat, and the only thing the characters could do was talk, talk, talk.  This might have been a mildly interesting 1 1/2 hour movie with a good script doctor and an objective editor, but it would seem Mr. Smith has too much pride and/or too much creative control to cut any extraneous words or frames.  For example, as much as I love to look at Salma Hayek, her character didn't need to be there.  Nor did a monster made entirely of excrement, who appears and dies in the same scene, for no reason, with no purpose, other than to be disgusting.Okay, there were a couple of laughs, most notably delivered by two of the more believable characters, Rufus (Chris Rock) and Jay (Jason Mewes).

Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were very good as the renegade angels trying to get back into heaven at any costs. Chris Rock was of course funny but he also showed a more dramatic side as Rufus the 13th Apostle. Linda F. was good as the last descendant of Jesus Christ and Alan Rickman was hilarious as well. The rest of the cast of characters were equally enjoyable. Jay and Silent Bob were funny even though the sex humor got a bit carried away at times and Alanis Morrisette was adorable as God.

To this day, it makes me feel bad that this film got all the negative controversy it got, when such other movies like the lackluster ""Stigmata"" presented Roman Catholicism in a more darker tone. Even ""End of Days"", which was good, did more or less the same thing. As far as I'm concerned, all subjects should be open for parody, even issues concerning religion, and ""Dogma"" does it quite brilliantly, and very uncompromising. This is a thoroughly original story, and it has dynamic and memorable characters, too. The entire cast was terrific, especially Ben Affleck, who for my money delivered his best performance yet.

It has some of all genres: drama, thriller, action and especially comedy. There are some first rate performances. Indeed, there are few that are below ""good"", no bad, a couple of averages. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are chilling in their going from warm-hearted and humane to coldly distanced. Linda Fiorentino is great as the woman who gets all this shoved in her face. A very nice detail is that, for all View Askew-fans, Jay and Silent Bob are back! Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith (also the director) take their characters to new highs and lows (in the good sense).

I have been a fan of Smith's since his breakthrough picture Clerks, and any Smith fan will not be disappointed with this film.  Here, Smith tells the story of two fallen angels who are trying to find a way back into heaven and the people charged with stopping them.  This very original concept is exploited in order to ask many questions about the nature of God and the nature of man.  That and it contains the requisite (and always funny) ""dick and fart"" jokes.Linda Fiorentino grounds the picture by giving a down-to-earth performance as the mortal who must stop the renegade angels.  Jay and Silent Bob are along to help her, and as usual, are hilarious.  I guess there really isn't anything bad to say about Dogma.

On the other hand, there are scenes of such vulgarity that they're really and truly hard to watch, the worst of these, of course, being the one featuring the Excremental, or the S**t Demon--but then, this scene is somewhat redeemed by the Muse's explanation of the Demon's nature (composed of bodily wastes of criminals crucified on Golgotha), which has the same pseudo-logical tone as most authentic (?) dogma.And, of course, I could f*****g take issue with a whole f*****g lot of the f*****g language, especially when f*****g Jason Mewes is doing the f*****g talking.  But f**k it.DOGMA is not for the faint of heart, or for the faint of faith.  Kevin Smith believes as least two things about God, or Jehovah, or Allah, or Man Above (an Arapaho appellation I especially like) that I do, and these beliefs inform the entire film:     1.  GOD IS PLAYFUL.       2.  GOD IS FALLIBLE.  These two statements, verging on blasphemy to those who would rather believe than think, go a long way towards explaining the fanatic hostility that has greeted this very funny and wonderfully acted film from certain quarters. If you have no problem with these two ideas, then you'll probably love this film.  Kudos to Kev Smith for having the humor, the perception, and the courage to make it.",Dogma

This is an example of what film can do... stimulate conversations, thoughts, debate, disagreements.  With there already being a fervor over the movie, I'm sure that once it opens there will be both extremes of personal opinion  . . those loving it and those hating it, with few caught in the middle.  The reviews, too, will more than likely be at opposite ends of the scale.  All I will say is, don't let the perceptions of others determine your decision to see the film.  If you are at all interested in it (either ""negatively"" or ""positively"" it) go and see it for yourself.

259,Mercader79,Not blasphemous - just bad.,4,24 April 2001,"I badly wanted Dogma to be good. When I first heard Kevin Smith was doing a religious film and about the subsequent outrage this had provoked from the Church and the usual quarters, my heart leapt. I am a big Kevin Smith fan - from Clerks, his superb debut, the unfairly maligned Mallrats through to the enjoyable Chasing Amy, his work has been a constant boon to US independent cinema in recent years. Now was his chance to echo the comedic success on a religious theme of The Life of Brian and to repeat the controversy of Scorsese's Last Temptation of Christ.Dogma is certainly full of amusing and witty ideas. What did Jesus do during the mysterious 'middle years' between twelve and thirty, upon which the Bible is silent? Why not have a priest proposing a new logo - a Jesus giving a thumbs-up sign - to replace the 'depressing' crucifix symbol? The Bible belt's predictable cries of blasphemy are unsurprisingly ill founded to. Dogma is overly deferential to Smith's Catholic Church if anything.
I want to see the film reminiscent of Chesterton and high satire on religion which some have alluded to. But the film I saw was a disastrous mess. The antics of Jay and Silent Bob (surely time to give these two a rest?) and Damon and Affleck's angels didn't mesh at all with the otherwise epic themes on show. Somehow I managed to ignore the film's numerous flaws for the most part until quite near the end. Alan Rickman's performance was terrible - I would say he was wholly unsuited to comedy had he not been so brilliant since in Galaxy Quest. He sounded like an American attempting an English accent (something of a feat as he is English). Then there was the general feeling that Smith was trying to make two ultimately irreconcilable movies - religious satire and Mallrats-style caper at once. But at some point - probably when the camera was lingering on bullets being fired into Affleck's angel wings - the horrible truth became unavoidable. Kevin Smith has made his first bad movie. And this is surely the greatest sin of all.",Dogma
260,charly1,8 out of 10,8,26 January 2000,"This is not the first movie I've seen by Kevin Smith, nor will it be my last.  I wish I could have loved this film as much as I loved ""Clerks"", but I didn't.  I think that one reason this film and many of his ideas are not ready for the movie-going public is that he is so heavily based in comics. Dogma plays like a live-action comic.  I believe he is one director who could do any comic book character well, especially Superman, which was dropped.It was great to see so much of my hometown in the film, too bad it had to represent Wisconsin.  But, that's our lot in life, Pittsburgh seldom gets the credit in a great film - see Silence of the Lambs for the finest example of no screen credit.  I really loved that the nun at the airport was played by none other than Lady Elaine from Mister Rogers' neighborhood.  With the loss of Don Brockett (Chef Brockett) a few years ago, perhaps she will get the most cameos in 'Burgh films.Kevin Smith is young and fresh.  His movies, especially this one, reflect that.  There are some points of contention in the film that make Catholics angry.  I haven't heard this much commotion since Last Temptation of Christ. At any rate, I think given some support from the film community, Kevin can add an interesting voice to the chorus.  I just hope that non-comic fans can handle his visions.One more thing, Silent Bob gives his best performance in this role!Can't wait for Clerks 2!",Dogma

I could really only notice one flaw in this movie: Salma Hayeck. Her character, Serendipity the muse, was funny at times, but they could have(and should have) made her part a little bigger. She needed a big, noticeable performance to save her career after ""Wild Wild West"", but this wasn't it. However the rest of the movie was quite good. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck show considerable screen chemistry, and they both do really well. I also couldn't get enough of Jay and Silent Bob, and I'm glad that they finally have a big part in a movie, because they were simply HILARIOUS! I feel that the movie's two best performances came from Chris Rock(This is easily his best performance ever) as Rufus, and from Alan Rickman-I laughed hard, several times during the first scene with him- as Metatron. The special effects that they used were very good, two more than any others: 1. The repulsive Golgothan monster that attacks Bethany and her friends in the bar. 2. The angels' wings ( I was really impressed in the end, seeing Ben Affleck gracefully float down to the ground) All in all, this movie was terrific, and can be loved by believers and nonbelievers alike.",Dogma

The greatest problem is Mr. Smith's strong belief in his own cleverness. He so sure that he is being dashed clever and original that he forgets to be either. The result is that for every genuinely funny bit---and there are a few---there are is at least one long, utterly boring bit of cant. Some are delivered by Mr. Rock whose high-pitched, whining, complaining voice begins to grate after a while. Also, Mr. Morissette as God was a thoroughly bad idea. Why couldn't they have picked a good looking woman? There are quite a few around. There is a lot of confused mythology floating in the film.

267,doctor_dolittle,A Comic Romp Through The Garden Of Eden!,9,27 February 2000,"I just came back from watching ""DOGMA"" and let me tell you it is a hilarious, comic-romp in the world of Catholicism. The story alone is worth the admission price: Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), an abortion clinic employee is sent by an angel (portrayed perfectly by Alan Rickman) to stop Loki and Bartleby, two fallen angels, from returning into heaven after being booted out and beating the system by finding a loop hole to get back in. Along the way, Bethany runs into two prophets who are, of course, Kevin Smith's timeless characters Jay and Silent Bob. While traveling to New Jersey with the two hormone-driven goofballs, the travelers encounter Rufus (Chris Rock), the 13th apostle not mentioned in the Bible because he's black, and Serendipity (Salma Hayek), an abstract (muse)-turn-stripper. As the road trip continues, we learn that many of the Christian myths are really not myths: Jesus was a black man, God is a woman, sex is a joke, etc. Dogma is part road-movie, part buddy-flick, part religious escapade, and, basically, it's ""The Bible: The Comic Book!"" Throw in Jason Lee as a Demon, skaters from hell, and a mission to destroy everyone behind the Mooby conspiracy and what else could you ask for. Perfect performances, classic direction, and a laugh-out-loud funny script make this one of the best films of 1999. So, take the advice of the movie's tag-line and ""Get touched by an angel!""

I love a good satire, and nothing is sacred, but this movie could have used a lot more subtlety to be keep my interest.

Not only does this movie send out a great message I found myself practically rolling on the floor. I love Kevin Smith movies, ""Clerks"", ""Mallrats"", and ""Chasing Amy"" were all great. I love the returning Kevin Smith movie alumnis: Jason Lee(Azrael), Brian O'Halloran(Gill Hicks the TV reporter), Scott Mosier(Smooching seaman), Ben Affleck(Bartleby, who started out in Kevin Smith movies before his claim to fame in ""Good Will Hunting."") and of course the Red Bank blunt connection Jay and Silent Bob played by Jason Mewes and writer and director Kevin Smith. And a full, talented cast: Matt Damon, Linda Fiorentino(she's a slut..bonngg!), Salma Hayek, Alan Rickman, Chris Rock, and the great actor George Carlin.   Dogma is a religious comedy about 2 angels Bartleby and Loki dropped down from heaven into Milwaukee for all eternity.

Do you people JUST NOT CARE that half the characters added nothing to the film?  Does it not worry you that the ending was an incoherent jumble?  Do you really find Silent Bob funny?  I mean, how many times can you laugh at the 'guy says nothing for half an hour and then finally pipes up' gag?I have enjoyed Kevin Smith's work in the past, but Dogma fails to impress on any level.  It's not funny enough for a comedy (sure there's a few good lines, but at a strike rate of about one in twenty), it's not fast-paced enough for an action/adventure (and for large segments is just plain boring) and falls WAY SHORT of an intelligent critique of religion or the church.As for specific criticisms -the film is no way 'controversial', and the 'theme' (if you can call it that) is nothing more than simplistic drivelChris Rock (aka Rufus the Apostle) is irritating and pointlessSalma Hayek makes Chris Rock look goodMatt Damon and Ben Affleck's characters are poorly developed and inconsistentJay is funny in small doses but gets way too much screen timeand Silent Bob reminded me of bad street theatre (like those crappy buskers you pass in the street that stand still for hours or mime that they're 'trapped in a glass box')All in all, I view this film as a missed opportunity.

Silent Bob actually speaks a line and can be called a hero when he almost single-handedly takes on Bartleby & Loki on the train. Brilliant, I laugh just thinking of these characters. Then there's good old Ben and Matt--eye candy bad guys. Alan Rickman deserves a note for playing Metatron, a somewhat mysterious, Anglo-accented and stern Angel who seems to do God's talking for her and Jason Lee who plays the gangster-like Azrael. There's a little literature and religion hidden in here too as the movie seems to use Milton's ""Paradise Lost"" (the revolt of the Angel Lucifer and followers against god and their being cast down to hell) to set up the story.God is not only a woman, but a goofy one--God does not speak in this movie at all. Alanis Morrisette played this role perfectly...when she started doing handstands in front of the church...I nearly lost it.There is some blood and carnage, starting with the Stygian Triplets attacking god on the boardwalk, the scene in the bar where Azrael offs the bartender and of course the climactic scene in front of the church.

Contrary to that fact, if you have a low level of hatred and bigotry into you, you'll have to love this movie -I'm afraid that the vast majority of Catholics and more than a half of the other Christians are out this tolerance bracket, and ought to hate it. On the one hand this movie will make laugh your guts out, on the other you have a coherent and well-learned insight into an intolerant, late and heretic sect of Judaism which is a.k.a. Catholicism. I think this movie is too much benevolent on the heresiarchs-followers of Paul who in the First Century underhandedly twisted the teachings of the allegedly Messiah into that anthology of threats and bribery which are the back bone of the church of Rome. Not only some of the dogmas of Catholicism would have been anathematized by the ancient Jews, but by Rabbi Yeshua  Jesus Christ  himself. Of course that If I were a Catholic I would be more comfortable with Mr. Gibson's Gospel of Hatred and Humiliation than what I'm with the Good News brilliantly crafted by Kevin Smith.As far as I know Mr. John Paul II said that the facts on Gibson's movie were accurate - the Pope should have received the green light through the Holly Hot-line, that's for sure.

Linda Fiorentino is perfect as Catholic that's lost her faith, and Chris Rock gives his best acting job in this movie. While he is a loudmouth, he also has a more thoughtful side, as the 13th apostle( left out of the Bible because he was black ). I don't really like Damon or Affleck ( they sound like they should be in a Tarantino film ) but they generated sympathy as two exiled angels merely wanting to go home. Alan Rickman was my favorite actor though( in a minor role ) as Metatron, the Voice of God. His exaggerated English accent, and hungover-type angel persona was the best character in the movie.

I felt that the audience, much like myself, was straining to find enjoyment in the movie.  We all wanted to like this movie. Unfortunately, with the exception of the character of Jay, there wasn't much to like.I think there are three major sources for the failure of ""Dogma"":1. Linda Fiorentino.  I just didn't care about her.  She had no energy in this movie.  It seemed like she was irritated to be in the movie.  She just didn't fit in, which is a darn shame, considering she was the main character.2. Kevin Smith tried to expand himself as a writer/director.  More power to him, but don't forget what made you popular to begin with.  I don't need a movie with wall-to-wall sex jokes, but keep in mind that this is a comedy. Yes, you can have serious issues in a comedy, but you can also try to fit in some jokes as well.3. Kevin Smith should write, not direct.  The clunky nature of Kevin Smith's directing is somewhat charming with his other movies, but ""Dogma"" required a more skilled hand.  It's Smith's first big film in scope-- with special effects and elaborate costumes to boot.  All the scenes seemed slightly off and uncomfortable.  It felt like a small-time movie doing a poor job at pretending to be a huge, Hollywood blockbuster.

By getting back into Heaven, they will prove that God is not infallible, consequently bringing about the end of existence.Despite the somewhat heavy and serious subject matter, this is  a comedy (as the disclaimer states, ""even God has a sense of humor""). Be warned, don't see this movie just for Alanis Morissette. Despite the fact she plays God, she gets about 5 minutes of screen time and speaks even less then Silent Bob! See this movie because it is a truly funny comedy film that doesn't take itself seriously, thanks in large part to the prophets (Jay and Silent Bob) and the 13th Apostle, Rufus (Chris Rock). The subject matter and negative reviews deterred me from seeing this movie in theaters, but I am so glad I saw it on video. This film is far better than the other Kevin Smith film I've seen, Clerks. Once more, if you want to have a lot of laughs, this is one you must see. 8 out of 10 stars",Dogma

287,mcdooley,This movie's about as deep as a pie tin,3,17 February 2007,"One of the dullest supposed ""comedies"" ever produced. Apparently it is supposed to be a witty satire and fails miserably on this point. Openly takes itself way too seriously as a deep, thought-provoking film, but the supposedly profound ideas are so sophomoric they remind me of what we thought passed for ""wow, man, that's heavy"" back in the tenth grade. ""New"" questions that actually go back to at least the 1960s include whether Jesus was black and gender issues in the Bible in general.Threadbare, worn-out, easy targets of this movie include the hypocrisy of the Catholic Church (wow, that's a new one) and the tax-exempt status of churches as a whole. Foul language (which is fine in the right context) and juvenile snide commentary masquerade as wit. An excellent movie for people who don't read.",Dogma
288,VerbalKint-2,Anti-religion? Nope. Where'd they get that idea?,9,12 November 1999,"What the HELL is the Catholic church so up-in-arms about?  Never in my life have I laughed so hard at a movie while being so thoroughly educated by it.  This film is not at all anti-religion or anti-Catholicism.  If anything, it gives religion a boost by infusing some much-needed comic relief into its often depressing messages.Having read the script long ago (God bless the internet), I knew this film was not to be a typical Kevin Smith movie, or at least not typical in the tradition of Clerks or Mallrats.  It was still very obviously a View Askew movie, but its complex (but clear) story and sense of direction was something that took me by surprise when I read the script.  It was a nice surprise, though, because the story was so good:Two fallen angels may unwittingly destroy the world by going against God's will and re-entering heaven thereby negating existence, which is wholly based upon the idea that God is infallible.  The last known descendant of Christ is sent to stop them from succeeding.  Who's ever written such an ambitiously original story?  I can't think of one.  And yes, Jay and Silent Bob are here.  Snoogans!To sum up, Dogma is an often hilarious, frequently enlightening story that deserves much more respect from the Church than it is getting.  If the Catholic League wants to attack a film, they should pick on Stigmata.

I'm so glad not a dime of my money ended up in Smith's pocket for this stupid waste of time. I have to confess that this review is not based on the entire movie because after 52 minutes I just gave up. I couldn't endure it anymore.

290,cho cho,Puerilely torpedoes every Catholic taboo ...,7,21 July 2000,"... including those it doesn't get around to mentioning. ""Dogma,"" the movie of the same name maintains, derives etymologically from the Greek for ""to think,"" something the Church putatively doesn't want its members to do.But when you think about this movie, it makes no sense. By its end, the only truth you can hold on to about God (Alanis Morisette!!!) is that She always gets her way--except when, during a Skeeball getaway in Asbury Park as a senior male human derelict, he or She becomes a puck for roller-hockey thugs in cahoots with Azrael, a fence-sitting demon disloyal even to Lucifer. Under just those particular circumstances, the Almighty gets John Doe'd into a hospital bed, put on life support, and held there until the Last Scion, the only living descendant of the Virgin Mary, can rescue Her.Meanwhile, there are these two Wisconsin-banished angels, one the erstwhile Angel of Death, locked out of Heaven for insubordination. As a form of plenary indulgence, the Church has decreed that any pilgrim passing through the arch of a certain New Jersey church will gain an uncancelable ticket to beyond the Pearly Gates. Our alienated angels see it as their made-in-Heaven loophole, the only way for them to defy God's express will and rejoin their exalted choirs.The skeptical Scion, played by Linda Fiorentino, gets a visitation from God's mouthpiece, the slithy-but-loyal Metatron (Alan Rickman). Get thee to New Jersey, says he. Head the angels off. If they pass through that arch, God will be shown up as fallible. All of existence will go poof.Along the way to testing this half-believed hypothesis and, with any luck, rescuing God, our Scion meets the 13th Apostle, exiled from the Bible for being black--as, supposedly, was Christ himself; a pair of unlikely prophets (one who can't stop talking about, er, forking her and one who never speaks) whose witless mission it is to abet hers; and the Golgothan, the toilet-overflowing monster who is the sum total of all the bowel evacuations of all who were crucified on the same hill as Christ.The whole ensemble is potty-mouthed, in fact--except Metatron, too enervated and effete to use four-letter words, the prophet Silent Bob (Kevin Smith, the film's writer-director), and, of course, God Herself, whose voice may not be heard by human ears lest they be detonated beyond eternity.The real reason God cannot speak, if this movie is taken literally, is that She could not do so without self-contradiction. She might have to reveal why Her omnipotence could not get Her out of that hospital bed, why She gave Her Church on Earth enough loophole rope, absolution-wise, to hang existence itself, why angels, who unlike humans have no free will, could even so defy Her, or why her divine chilling-out regimen includes Skeeball and handstands.The movie is wickedly funny, and puerile beyond belief. If no rational propositions made about God could be true, it suggests, no lascivious propositions made to complete strangers could be sinful. Keep the faith real: do every funky thing.",Dogma
291,Basf-2,Just not funny most of the time.,5,12 January 2000,"The making of comedies about the big questions of life ( ""why are we here?"", ""does God really exist and is he a he or a she?"") should be the privilege of Woody Allen and maybe the Monty Python team. Not of young film makers who have only made one succesfull, very low budget movie, and are now given lots of Hollywood millions to work with, because they are considered to be the new future of film making. Or just because Hollywood just can't have it that someone else in the industry makes a little money and has some succes. The young film maker usually can't resist the temptations of Hollywood, and take ""offers they can't refuse"". This time it happens to Kevin Smith, who made a hit a few years ago with his entertaining little movie ""Clerks"". Since then he made two other movies in Hollywood, and now he has made a Hollywood monstrosity: a movie that should have been an off- beat comedy, but now, despite ( or because of)  all the Hollywood millions and technology and ""big names"", turns out to be over the top and just not funny most of the time. It's a story about two fallen angels ( Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) who are trying to get back to heaven. By divine intervention a woman ( Linda Fiorentino) is appointed to try to stop them. On that mission she meets all kind of strange ""people"": angels, prophets, apostels, demons and even God. Damon and Affleck give a reprise of John Travolta and Samuel Jackson in ""Pulp Fiction"": constantly talking all the time. ( By the way: I never understood all the fuzz about Damon and Affleck; they're good actors and their debut ""Good Will Hunting"" was a solid Hollywood movie, but in fact I think they're a bit boring and have no real ""edge"". Damon for instance, was completely played of the screen by Edward Norton, a REAL new acting talent, in ""Rounders"" two years ago.) Alan Rickman ( a very fine actor) is an angel and tries hard to save his role, but does not really succeed. If you want to see him as an angel ( or something like that) go and see ""Truly, Madly, Deeply""; in this film he's really great! The director himself reappears in his by now well known role of Silent Bob. Finally: it's about time there comes an end to the ""gimmick"" of constantly citing and displaying  knowledge of other movies by characters. I've seen this in for example ""Clerks"", ""Scream"", and now here it happens once again. I think the joke has worn out by now.",Dogma

The characters are unlikeable, both the good and the bad guys, and the actors don't seem to know what to do with their characters. This movie doesn't know if it wants to be a philosophical movie, a monster movie, a comedy or a drama so it rambles along like a ship without a captain. Silly jokes, silly situations, endless bickering and discussion and all that don't help. The theme is potentially interesting, but neither the writer nor the director seem to have a clue how to make an interesting movie on the theme.

298,HLMENCKEN,No redeeming social value,1,15 April 2002,"One tries to find something to like about this movie or at least one looks forward to it with anticipation that it might be as good as say, Chasing Amy. But it's not; it's an unmitigated piece of trash. It is gratuitously violent, gory and quite frankly boring. One can stomach the foul mouth of Jay Mewes when he appears in only one scene as he did in Chasing Amy, but a full two hours of his potty mouth are too much to take. I can't believe Kevin Smith actually writes dialog or monologue for this untalented jackass. But if anyone deserves worship from Jay Mewes it is Smith for allowing him to make a living acting like a idiot in a variety of movies. Do people behave like this? I'm hoping to see a future movie starring Bob and SILENT JAY. As far as the movie's blasphemy and offensiveness to the church: It's not funny. It's not biting criticism. It's just ranting foolishness that makes little sense. It causes one to feel pity and sorrow for the director and writer of the movie more than anything else. However, I guess a movie in which Chris Rock appears to say f*** and s*** less than any other cast member really does qualify as a clever satire of real life.  Then there are the vastly overrated Affleck and Damon. I think the depth of Matt Damon's acting talents were totally on display during the dinner table scene in Mystic Pizza. Check it out.

301,jjpurwitsky,Dogma directed by Kevin Smith,8,14 December 2012,"Dogma is a strange beast of a movie. It is at times hilarious, smart and dramatic while at other times it is juvenile, misguided and irrational. The fourth movie from Kevin Smith, Dogma, plays out nicely but leaves the viewer slightly empty after watching the film.The plot concerns two angels, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who have been banned from heaven and have found a loop hole that will get them back in. At the same time, a woman, Linda Fiorentino, is charged by God to stop them. The movie races from one scene to the next, leaving no time to breathe. Joke after joke comes flying at the viewer, while at the same time philosophical banter on religion comes just as fast. Like Clerks. and Mallrats, this movie is made up of a whole mesh of scenes that form a cohesive whole. Unlike those movies though, there is a strong story that is told as the movie plays out.Coming after Chasing Amy, an absolutely fantastic low budget romantic comedy, Smith's Dogma just seems to pale in comparison. The movie tells a story but the scenes and dialogue come at you so fast that there is never time to digest what just happened. Just as you are thinking about the last scene, or about the comedic repertoire spouted out by one of the characters, or the commentary on Christianity (or religion in general) that is rather astute in it's logic, Smith throws another of those three motifs at you. You forget about what it was that made you think, or laugh and you move on to the next piece. About 90 percent of the film plays out this way. If Dogma was a straight out comedy, like Clerks., then this wouldn't be a problem, but considering the dramatic theme on religion that is inherent in the script, the movie just doesn't play out as well as it could. Even though the film feels a tad too long at it's just over two hour runtime, the film could of been a wee bit longer to flesh out the ideas that Smith is trying to convey.That aside, the only other complaint I have with Dogma is that at times it comes off as rather tepid. Bodily function jokes and cheap shots at sex and religion are in abundance, and again, in the right context this type of humor works a hell of a lot better. Chasing Amy showed a more mature side of Kevin Smith. It was far more sophisticated than Mallrats and even Clerks.. Dogma tries real hard to reach the same heights as, and even soar past, Chasing Amy and there are fleeting glimpses of it succeeding but ultimately the poop joke overshadows the rest of the film.One last thing before I move to the positives of Dogma. There are many a plot hole in this film. There is one glaring one that cannot be mentioned, in lieu of giving away a major plot point, but one that frustrated me to no end. The rest of them, I think could easily of been avoided if the movie was a few minutes longer.Okay, onto the good things about Dogma.The acting in this film is pretty damn good. All the leads are excellent and even though I usually don't like Chris Rock, he was pretty damn good too. Fiorentino exudes cool and sexy, Alan Rickman is strong as ever and Affleck and Damon are always fun to watch together. But this film belongs to Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith). Having made somewhat brief appearances in Smith's previous three films, they return as major characters this time around. The two together are uproarious and are a joy to watch.And Smith's direction of the action is better than anything he has done before. Chasing Amy delivered on a promise he showed in Clerks. and Dogma expands on that delivery. Shooting for the first time in the scope ratio of 2.35, Smith and his crew have made a beautiful looking film. With rich colours, beautiful framed shots and more camera movement than Clerks., Mallrats and Chasing Amy combined, Dogma stands out as the first Kevin Smith film that is more than just a screenplay. Smith has a much bigger budget to play with this time around and he uses it to great effect.And the sound. I can't not mention the sound. Smith's previous films have all sounded flat. They didn't need much in way of sound but still, they were rather flat and tinny with not much in production value. Not Dogma! Nu-uh! Armed with a great score by Howard Shore and a rich and lustful sound effects track, Dogma sounds awesome. It's clear, it's loud, it's enveloping; it's a thing of beauty.Kudos Mr. Smith on your fourth feature film. It's nice to see you blossoming into such a fine director, much better than what you gave the world in Mallrats. Dogma is a good film, it's witty and smart and is fun to watch right from the get go. It's just a shame that it comes off as so inconsequential. A movie that tackles the subjects that Dogma does should leave the viewer thinking long after the credits role. Sadly, after watching Dogma, all one is left with at the end of the day is a hazy memory of a poop joke.Film Rating: 79%Breakdown (How Dogma scored 79%):Production Design: 8 out of 10 Cinematography: 8 out of 10 Re-playability: 8 out of 10 Originality: 9 out of 10 Costumes: 8 out of 10 Directing: 8 out of 10 Editing: 7 out of 10 Acting: 8 out of 10 Music: 8 out of 10 Script: 7 out of 10Read more of my reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com",Dogma
302,generichorrorfreak,the best Kevin Smith film (that I've seen),8,9 October 2010,"Clerks and Mallrats are pretty cool films that make a good watch. The second Clerks installment is an OK film but goes nowhere in almost its entirety and too many of the characters are just annoying. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is utter crap that *probably* had a purpose (despite starring mine and everyone's favorite characters, perhaps proof that they were not meant to be leads). Chasing Amy is a great movie which all the theory-talk and bizarre possibilities inside it makes your head spin. Kevin Smith's films are a coin toss, you never know if it'll be good or bad and it has little to do with how the previous or next movie rates.Dogma is one step up from Chasing Amy and the best of the bunch. With an awesome story, a nicely crafted set of characters, and their respective places in the plot line that come together like fitting puzzle pieces. Dogma is almost ingenious, and yes a movie from the same man that brought us Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. For starters you have a plot with a purpose; this isn't some generic Disney-esquire story of gaining faith with a miracle or some similar crap. You have unforeseen twists and turns. You have characters popping up that all play an important role, and they're all interesting. There's no generic roles either (guardian angel or what have you), as all these characters are a takeoff from what is actually in the bible or have their place in the ""askew-niverse."" The story is insanely cool, you wonder how a person could come up with something this intriguing. There's tons of mainstream actors, and none of them butcher the film like you might expect. The only character/actor I don't like in Dogma is Salma Hayek; she is beyond annoying and they could have at least made her change her accent and tone down that annoying personality for this role. If there's one downfall with this movie, it's her.Otherwise, there's hilarity, there's ideas that make you think, there's oddity yet sensibility, there'a focus on religion that can even keep an atheist like myself interested, there's Jay and Silent Bob, and above all there's a plot that keeps your eyes open and an ending just as perfect as the whole rest of the movie.If you aren't too sure where you stand with Kevin Smith films, or was disappointed with Clerks II or J&SBST, or are just looking for a good movie that will keep your mind awake and engaged and entertained, Dogma is a must-see.",Dogma
303,floatmyboat,"Disappointing, botched, amateurish attempt at a loaded topic",3,24 September 2007,"Watching this film was long overdue. I had heard of Kevin Smith's cult following and had experienced the wonderful ride that Chasing Amy was. To add to that, the concept behind Dogma was pretty darn cool. The cast was big, the canvas huge, and the agenda enormous. But none of it could salvage this sinking vessel. All the king's horses and all the king's men, and so forth.Kevin Smith's greatly touted skill has been his dialog. He is arguably among the finest pens that write long-winded tirades, witty comebacks, and insightful observations. Remarkably, Dogma showed an utter lack of sophistication or tact. The moments that made me laugh could be counted on the fingers. Of one hand. Of E.T. I have seen the man in action not more than two days ago, when he had come our university for the third run of his An Evening with Kevin Smith show. I just can't imagine how someone who had our rapt attention for five whole hours could come up with embarrassing dialog like in this film. The trite and corny lines almost overloaded my Cringe-o-meter.The whole affair had a thick coat of amateurism on it. No doubt, films such as Clerks and Chasing Amy aren't known for their polish and slickness, but this film has the sensibilities of a high-school production. Blocky edits and choppy transitions make an already tedious film all the more unbearable. The characters are mere sketches, with a pretense of a background or a personality. It almost seems like everyone's just being themselves while knocking off a few beers and reading out the lines half-assed. It is hard to believe anyone took anything seriously on the sets.Dogma begins with a few disclaimers about how it is supposed to be humorous and not intended to offend anyone. I seriously doubt anyone who sees the movie would be offended by it. Except perhaps fans of Kevin Smith and the discerning members of the audience. The ""philosophy"" presented in the movie is so thin you could have it instead of the Atkins diet. I have heard deeper words from people who have put a gallon of beer behind them. I am sure some (or most) of the ideas have come from such evenings of drunken revelry.This is a film without redemption.

Now, mind you, this is not an anti-catholic movie -- in fact, it's quite the opposite. All it's saying is that sometimes we can get so caught up in arguing over the rules of our religion, that sometimes we can lose sight of the faith itself. Any catholic who hasn't *ahem* religiously gone  to church in awhile should see this movie -- it might just hit home with them.It's not perfect -- it gets cheesy in parts, Fiorentino and Rickman have given better performances.

I'm no fan of Matt Damon, either, but Loki is likeable enough that I forgot who was playing him. I can relate to Bethany in some ways.

This film has a message - that the supposed 'faithful' have screwed up, not the church. However, some people who think themselves the chosen, will find the portrayal of God (as a woman dressed by Lacroix), angels (dressed by Hugo Boss) and the end of the world as blasphemous.  This film is a gem - a delightful 'what if' scenario that covers everything from the virgin birth to the films of John Hughes!  The dialogue is clever and we are shown a world that has, sadly, gone astray because of patriarchy, blind faith, intolerance and lack of compassion. This film is a much needed tonic which gets one to think of why we are here and to question one's beliefs.  This film squarely sides with redemption and faith and takes all the pomposity out of organised religion.  Full marks to Kevin Smith and the cast - Matt Damon is great as Loki, the former angel of death, Ben Affleck shines as Bartleby the watcher but top dollar to Linda Fiorentino and Alan Rickman - their scenes together are worth the price of admission.  This is a brave film and should be seen by more people - my Catholic School upbringing got a good shake up - at last!  I will always treasure the scene where God does a handstand...",Dogma

DOGMA turns Catholicism upside down and shakes it by its ankles hoping for some loose change to fall out.  Using imagery and symbolism from the Judaeo-Christian tradition, Kevin Smith asks the big questions -- who, where, and what is God, and what do we have to do with said God?  He comes up with answers and, more importantly, ideas.  As with all KS movies, VERY SERIOUSLY not for young children.   Ben Affleck's preaching debut.",Dogma

1)  It isn't funny, except in a few spots.2)  It isn't satirical, except for a few bits with Carlin and with Chris Rock (most people know Jesus was semitic/black, by the way).3)  It wasn't interesting/tense.  It never got me to transcend my disbelief.On a positive note, Alanis Morissette brings the kind of playful spirit to God that I hope YHWH, the name that cannot be spoken, she of the great breasts, actually has.

Silent Bob and the always funny Jason Mewes. That guy was so funny, when they befriend a black men group in the bar, and he's like saying 'YEAH, YEAH-- Smoke that son of a bitch'.

That's gotta hurt!",8,13 January 2000,"Expectant of a film with a theme out to bash the church, I was slightly apprehensive of the motives of this film since I am a believer, with ideas, no church. But the films even states that it shouldn't be taken seriously. Simply put - Even God has a sense of humour. Inevitably this is never the case. Dealing with a touchy subject like religion, even the slightest variation of the holy text may cause mass hysteria. Even those that tend to intelligently ""dissect"" the film fall flat on their faces by the very virtue that this is not a history lesson, but live action comic-style ""adaptation"" loosely based around Christian faith. Bollocks to Theological research and the history lesson, this is entertainment. Ironically, it's now well-known that Kevin Smith is a devout Catholic, and the film whilst it distorts the bible in that ""Kevin Smith"" comic book kind of way, is just paying respect to its subject matter in a weird kind of way. Ironic again that Smith should infiltrate the ranks of protestors outside his own house and join in. That's one way of marketing your movie.
Once again, and thankfully, Jay and Silent Bob, return doing their usual hilarious thing. Silent Bob easily being the funniest character in the film. Do you think Smith had something to do with that? With some rousing performances from buddies Ben and Matt (Affleck and Damon, otherwise known as) and a typically ""cold"" humoured, Linda Fiorentino, I felt that Alan Rickman was a strange choice for the ""Voice of God"", Metatron. Chris Tucker was at his usual loudmouth, in-your-face humour and let's just say Selma was good at doing her Latino thing(s) in a breasty performance. Two hoots for a funny cast and magnificent script with razor-sharp dialogue.Foul language and bags of dirty jokes apart, this film is a contemporary look at the Good Book. Throughout the film there is always an underlying message and the film ends typical Hollywood style - everyone's happy and faith is restored. A not-so-subtle subliminal message. Entertainment big style, after all, who goes to see a Kevin Smith film and then compares it an Elmore Leonard script and Alfred Hitchcock movie.  Duh!?P.s. Hint: WOW! = OW!",Dogma

For one thing, it has a creative plot that draws heavily from religion and mythology to comment on the state of religion and society.  It also has several interesting characters played by good actors, and it's fun to watch their interaction and chemistry and enjoy the humor of the dialogue.But ""Dogma"" doesn't have anything really special or unique, and the disappointing and pitiful ending doesn't do the rest of the film justice. In fact, it really ruins the film as a whole, and puts it near the end of the list for films worth seeing.  If you enjoy social commentary and an examination of religion in modern society, this just might be worth seeing (after you've seen all of the ""tens"" and ""nines"" that the video store has to offer).",Dogma
322,miw-3,Long and Shallow,3,27 June 2004,"I usually enjoy religious satires and there have been some very good ones in this vein in the past (e.g. Life of Brian, etc.). When I watch one, however, I like to see something with something new and/or thoughtful to offer. ""Dogma"" was way too long at 2 hours and 10 minutes, and at the end I actually felt like it had been 3 hours long. While there were a few funny moments, it is pretty difficult for a comedy to stay funny for that long. Had the movie stayed within the confines of what the bible says, I'd have given it points for being clever. Unfortunately it introduces a lot of pseudo-religious trash along with the real material and completely loses its point on that score. Poking fun at theology is like shooting fish in a barrel. It's easy to take the cheap shots. So if you are going to go there, it's best to introduce something cleverer than wee-wee poo-poo jokes and a level of analysis somewhat above that of drunk freshmen on a Friday night. Except for one or two exceptional moments, Kevin Smith completely failed to do this in this movie. I may have been a little harsh in giving this movie 3/10 (highest level of ""don't bother"") and maybe should have given it 4/10 (lowest level of ""rent it only""), but then you can get better laughs and deeper philosophy watching re-runs of ""Friends"" on TV, and you can do that for free any day of the week3/10",Dogma

Dogma sees fallen angels Bartleby and Loki (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon)attempting to make their way back into heaven via a newly instituted catholic dogma. The problem with this lies in the fact that if they are successful, they would have overturned a ruling by God, hence God is always right and if proven wrong would result in the undoing of existence. The familiar presence of Jay and Silent Bob is comforting and ensures that some of the essence Smith's earlier work stays put, however at times this film dissents into areas that seem out of Smith's depth. There are some surprisingly touching moments which implies that Smith gave a great deal of thought, similar to that of Chasing Amy. In general it is a great all round cast, (Linda Fiorentino,Chris Rock, Alan Rickman) and it is obvious that whilst writing this Smith had his tongue firmly in cheek.",Dogma

I do my best to avoid propaganda films, no matter what the rating, and although this is not as bad as some others it doesn't take a genius to see what its going for. The scene in the parking with Loki and Bartleby in the parking lot when the Affleck character flips and rants on with some pretty weighty questions on Christianity and organized religion made me think some. I mean alright, fair enough, they invite one to think. And I did. Paused, and talked it out with my cynic side out loud.

The plot is so overly complicated that most of the time it is just ever-lasting explanations from characters and when it isn't it is just ridiculous effects and dismal acting. God only knows how Ben Affleck keeps managing to get big roles in films. Sooner or later somebody up there in Hollywood has got to realize that this guy can't act. Meanwhile Matt Damon is a very good actor but criminally wasted in this film. The light relief from the utter garbage that this film is, is the comedy of Jay and Silent Bob.

If you take a step back and see the movie for what it is worth, it is a satire. There is nothing in the movie that puts down Jesus or God unless you find offense to the ideas that God could be a woman or a man and that perhaps Jesus was black. Personally going to Catholic School for 14 years, I do not take offense to that because who cares if Jesus was black or God might be female. It doesn;t change any of the teachings. The satire comes in when speaking about the institution of the church and how corrupt it has been. If anybody knows anything about Church History, the Catholic Church is not the perfect. It is human like the rest of us and that is what makes this movie so great and smart. We analyzed all the scenes and characters and found that this gave us a new idea and outlook of how we can approach religion in the 21st century. It also makes God more personable to us all and, in my opinion, is one of the most important things we need right now in this messed up world. Kevin Smith, a Catholic, is genius when it came to make this movie.

Smith is great as Silent Bob, saying more with silence than most actors do with whole pages of dialogue.Although I did enjoy the film immensely, I gave it 9/10 because I felt it lacked just a little something that I can't really define.

As stated in earlier reviews, the references to Catholic catechism and parochial upbringing abound. I'm sure that Kevin Smith was taught by nuns and clergy, because he's constantly poking fun at things that I experienced in Catholic school. The actors are all having fun in this movie, even if they have no idea what it's all about. Jay and Silent Bob have real parts in Dogma, as opposed to Chasing Amy where they appear to be ""talking extras.""

Where I would give Clerks and Mallrats a 10, I give Dogma and Chasing Amy a 9.. but its not because these two actually dwelve into a story, its just that in Dogma it seems Jay and Silent Bob are somewhat tame compared to Clerks and Mallrats.Don't get me wrong, Dogma is hilarious.. but the jokes are more spread out throughout the movie instead of a continual ride. I think another reason is getting big(ger) stars in the movie that kinda ruins it. The stars were tolerable, but I wish there were more of the Askew crew like Dante and Randall and Mosier.

Fortunately he played the role well and didn't take any blatant pot-shots at organized religion. Anyway I enjoyed the movie and I am a practicing Catholic.

Kevin Smith is not advanced in spectacular film-making. Yet, he managed to deploy action into a movie that is based around serious duologue. Dialogue is obviously his snootch. It's obvious why Catholic activists morons would detest the idea of the creator of the coined term ""snootchie bootchies"", to make a film anyway relating to God. But, Kevin finished with a project that truly defined today's generation and our spiritual confusion. When Chris Rock explains that Jesus had brothers and sisters. He speaks in a blunt but sophisticated tone that makes you believe it was without a doubt, completely true. Kevin Smith dares to ask the questions that everyone thinks.

She projects an adult world-weariness and competency that would play well in many thrillers or dramas.  She fits in well in this comedy, too.Salma Hayek looks cuter than ever in Dogma.  I question her choice of films and roles in the recent past.  She should take more roles like this where she can show off her beauty and not be too serious.Kevin Smith falls victim to a temptation that many directors face: he casts himself in his own movies.

Offering a unique perspective which only Kevin Smith could probably get away with, I found it to be an instant winner, with one-liners, scenes, and other idealogy which is consistent with the New Jersey stories (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy) being churned out by View Askew.  I wasn't offended by it in the slightest, and when it comes out on home video, I'll definitely be adding this latest installment to my collection.The acting was par for the course as far as the View Askew flicks are concerned, however, the shocker was Alanis Morisette appearing in the role of God (which was pulled off very nicely indeed).Two thumbs up... way up for Dogma.

345,schmucko,bad bad bad.,3,4 February 2000,"this is the movie that made me an ex-kevin smith fan.  honestly, i'm not even christian, and wasn't the least offended by the subject matter--as a fan of the cinema, i was offended by its horrendous pace, its dumbed-down presentation and its lack of nearly anything commendable.the premise is great, and i was really looking forward to seeing the movie--had been for years, in fact.  little did i know that i was in for a self-indulgent, preachy, plodding 2+ hour waste of film.  the movie would probably have made a good one and a half hour flick.  see, the problem is that a good half of the movie is taken up by a new character (they join linda fiorentino as though she were dorothy from the wizard of oz) coming into the plot, then explaining who he/she is and how he/she fits into the overall story.i really felt sorry for fiorentino--she tried really hard to make something of the lines given to her, but no one can craft a good performance out of a litany of ""what do you mean?""s and ""why me?""s.  i silently promised myself that i would scream if another sitting-around-a-table scene ensued, and silently berated mr. smith every time it happened again.alanis morrissette makes a cute god, i suppose, if only because she flashes her boxers when doing a handstand--it's lovely that god is represented as so childlike, and fits the rest of the movie well.  and, as always, jay and bob's scenes are funny, punctuating a long, boring film that doesn't even try to be funny that often.  there: i've praised a couple of aspects.all in all, though, from the pretentious disclaimer at the top of the movie until the nauseating restatement of the moral at the end (fiorentino's last line is ""i don't believe it, but i have a good idea""--retch), i was thoroughly insulted by Dogma.  screw the money--i want my time back.  i suppose i'll have to get used to the fact that kevin smith probably isn't going to make another ""clerks"" or ""mallrats,"" and that he is lost to me forever.",Dogma
346,Doke,"Witty, insightful, and hilarious. Highly recommended.",10,12 November 1999,"Kevin Smith has done it again. This movie is witty, insightful and hilarious. Highly recommended. The central theme is an action-race-against-time plot.  However, Kevin Smith has surrounded it with thought provoking dialog,  sympathetic characters, and delightfully well-timed humor. In particular, he's managed to portray angles and demons, apostles and idiots, as understandable people.The movie supports the central beliefs of christianity, while ridiculing the formalized Catholic church.",Dogma
347,Drew-44,Believe in Dogma,8,16 November 1999,"From start to finish, Dogma is clearly the best film in Kevin Smith's portfolio.  Chasing Amy was a very good film, but there were moments when Smith seemed not to be able to decide what to do with the characters. That's not the case here, where a superb and unusual cast (George Carlin playing a Cardinal, Alanis Morrisette as God!!!) played out Smith's vision. Linda Fiorentino continues to prove herself as an actress and she is joined by an excellent supporting and co-starring cast. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are very convincing as the two fallen angels on their quest to return to Heaven.  Chris Rock is hilarious as the ""forgotten"" 13th Apostle, and sexy Salma Hayak (seeing her pole dancing was worth the price of admission alone), pulls off the role of the feisty muse, Serendipity.  Kevin Smith film regulars Jay (Jason Mewes) and Smith's own Silent Bob are at their funniest.  Whether it was a conscious decision or not, Smith toned down Jay and Bob a bit from his past movies, making their lines even funnier and more poignant. And Jason Lee was his usual dry, wisecracking self.  I like Smith also uses characters from his past films in minor, sometimes multiple roles. There has been an outcry from some that this film is anti-religion or more precisely anti-Church  To those people I say go see the movie.  Though you may find some things offensive, this movie is pro-religion/faith, not against it.  It is also a well written, directed, and produced film!",Dogma
348,Jofiseen,Poor Movie,4,12 July 2000,"A disappointing film - Affleck and Damon seemed to be just talking all the time as if to one another but not as their charcters. Also the use of language - Would angels actually talk about sex all the time and say things like ""get laid"" and ""f***"" ? I don't think so.Affleck and Damon should have been given some lines rather than adlib. There were some decent bits but not enough to outway the mixed up almost non-existant plot. Affleck and Damon were appaling - Obviously done for money. Hayek was good but it's also Alan Rickman's worst performance.

But that was okay, because I like that kind of thing (at least when it doesn't involve Arnold battling the Devil and such). And it never really got very heretical, but again, that was okay with me. Matt Damon seemed to be kind of coasting along at times, but the other good performances (notably Ben Affleck's) made up for it. So all in all, I enjoyed it.Dogma was certainly not perfect. A few scenes could have been cut and no one would have noticed. A few characters (Azrael, Bethany) could have done with more screen time. A couple speeches became a mite long-winded. Overall, though, it was a good sustained effort, and definitely different from most anything I have ever seen before... almost like some kind of bizarrely warped morality play. If you absolutely loved Kevin Smith's previous efforts, you will not automatically love Dogma; it doesn't have the same level of outrageous humour. If religious themes turn you on (and you're not a die-hard conservative), you'll probably like it. Go ahead, give it a try.",Dogma
350,Corinthian,Dogma-- It's no Dogme. (Insert groans here),8,13 November 1999,"I was raised Catholic, and I have to say, To hell with the whiners.  Get over it. With that out of the way...I was disappointed in terms of it being a Smith movie, but I was prepared for a lot of it going in. I understood Smith's ambition to go beyond his Jersey Trilogy fanboy nametag. I tried to swallow the whole Alanis thing, though I would never understand it. I did my best to look past Hayek's terrible performance.  She basically ruined every scene she was in.  Looks like she'll never be able to succeed past her stereotypical Mexican vixen roles.  Stick to Desperado, Salma.  There are questionable casting choices, including wasting Jason Lee on a one-dimensional villain, but Chris Rock has won over my skepticism. He pulls in the laughs, and surprisingly kept the grating aspect of himself to a minimum.  Rickman was amusing, though a little pasty-faced.  Fiorentino, Damon and Affleck turn out appreciable performances, as to be expected.    On to Smith's directing:  He really shouldn't.  I'm a huge fan of his writing, but he should at least let someone else coordinate any sort of action sequence. The look of the film isn't adequate for a piece this ambitious.   You won't see the same wit,or the play on pop culture that was so prevalent in his Trilogy, but you'll see what has become of the vision he had before Clerks.  He put a lot thought into this, though it definitely doesn't have the heart that I saw in Chasing Amy.  But it's made an impact on me.  It hasn't changed what I think, but perhaps, how I think.  Beyond the tediously over-dramatic ""God"", and the dung-thing I still haven't figured out, I think I got the idea.",Dogma

I don't know what all the fuss was all about, obviously Kevin Smith believes in his faith and his film reflects that although it does get a bit preachy towards the end. I'd have to say that this film would be nothing without J & S.B., those two!!! I'd follow them anywhere. Onward to Clerks 2!!",Dogma
352,mrhonorama,Nice try....,5,2 January 2001,"""Exposition"" would be a better title for this feature, as Kevin Smith bites off way more than any auteur could chew.  The script is bogged down by the constant lengthy explanations of various aspects of Catholicism and biblical history  -- Smith really was in a bind here, as he needed the explanations to play out his plot, but they only serve to remove the necessary flow to the story.Nevertheless, the provocative ideas and the fact that at one level Smith is taking religion seriously, gives the movie some value.  However, this creates the other trap the movie falls into, which is that it's jokey tone (which at times, is hilarious) makes the relative seriousness of the final act seem totally out-of-place.  Again, this may have been an insurmountable challenge for any director/writer.Seeing this movie reminded me of a comment by Andy Partridge of the band XTC.  He had attempted to prevent the release of ""Dear God"", one of XTC's most successful songs, a very questioning take on religion.  Partridge explained that he thought he had failed to encapsulate his feelings on the subject, noting that he could have written a 3-disc box set on the subject, and still only scratched the surface.  I wish I liked this better, and although I can't recommend it, I wouldn't dissuade someone from checking this out.Mike Bennett",Dogma
353,fdextro,Flawed but sincere work of theological art; comedic cinematic equal to the Sistine Chapel.,9,26 November 2000,"My ""summary"" is admittedly overblown, but Smith's interpretation of ever-changing Catholic dogma is as striking as Michelangelo's traditional portrait of a moment, if not nearly as beautiful.  The in-built chaos and repetition of themes represent real life and history, threads so messy and inexplicable that they force you to seek faith in a higher power.  Well, maybe not force you, but give you an idea.  And as the film points out, abstract ideas are much more positive and fruitful than unshakable beliefs. An idea is unbound; a belief is constraint.""Dogma"" is not easily praised or criticized.  Smith often goes for the cheap joke (his ""s**t demon"" is the worst) and obvious statement (or what should be obvious), but he has a rare gift for insightful dialogue and supportive direction.  His characters are as verbose as in any Tarantino movie, but they spout divine parables along with the one-eyed winking juvenile obsessions.  What makes Smith a great artist is that he manages to keep both extremes in balance, equally funny and moving.  He's also lucky enough to be blessed with incredibly talented actors.  Everyone in ""Dogma"" is first rate, although Smith blunders in his handling of the picketing anti-abortion crowd.  They're presented in a campy moronic style reminiscent of the anti-porn protesters in John Waters' ""Polyester"".  What worked with Waters (another Catholic, by the way) seems out of place and needlessly cruel in this movie.  Smith makes his point of how religious zealotry can lead to obsessive and destructive behavior much more eloquently through Rufus, the 13th apostle written out of the Bible because he's black. Smith obviously has his satirical knife sharpened, he just needs a little more restraint on how to use it.Those looking for another all-out Smith comedy like ""Clerks"" or ""Mallrats"" will be disappointed.  Even though Jay and Silent Bob are ostensibly the major heroes, their stoner antics take a backseat to Bethany's rediscovery of faith.  (If you want a plot description, look elsewhere.)  For all the bullsh-- protests, ""Dogma"" stands out as one of the few movies in recent times to reaffirm the existence of God.  Its ""blasphemy"" lies in our God-given right to make choices and interpret what we've been told.  The movie presents a fictional Armageddon ordained by the Pope, so Catholics had to blindly get up and protest.  That behavior suggests that the ""ism"" in Catholicism is akin to alcoholism.And by saying that, as a Catholic myself, I'm destined for hell.  Or at the very least, to be ""told"" I'm going to hell.In the meantime, check out Pasolini's ""The Gospel According To St. Matthew"".  It's as pure and faithful an account of Christ's life as you'll ever see on film.",Dogma
354,fuzzysham13,Catholics mourn their faith. I dislike anyone who treats God like a burden,10,6 August 2006,"Kevin Smith is a genius when it comes to making funny movies with subtext. The very first time I saw it I thought ""Wow, this is true and funny"". Now, I am a religious guy. I attend church on a regular basis and when I told someone there about the movie they thought it was blasphemous. I wondered how? Yeah there's the whole two renegade Angels trying to find their way back into Heaven, but that's not really what the movie is about. In my opinion the movie is about having faith in God, and that some of the little details don't matter so much. The only thing matters is that you believe in God. Personally I loved when Rufus makes fun of Bethany / Catholism for believing that Mary and Joseph never had other children. Come on. It's a leap of faith to believe a virgin gave birth, but it's divine intervention for a man and wife never to have sex. Mary and Joseph were humans like you and me and if at 13 I'm starting to wonder about sex, you think a 13 year old girl and a 20-ish year old man weren't itching to find out? And in all honesty that is a little detail. The important thing to take away from the movie is that having faith in God matters more than did or did not Mary have other children, does the communion wafer actually turn into the body of Christ - those don't matter any where near as much as believing. Agree or disagree with me, but that is how I feel.",Dogma
355,anonymousfangirl,A fascinating departure for Kevin Smith...,9,2 January 2002,"I'm a huge fan of Kevin Smith. That said, I'm going to enjoy any film that involves him, Jason Mewes, Jason Lee, and Ben Affleck. However, this film went farther than say, Mallrats. I'm an atheist, but I know Judeo-Christian theology, and it was used to hilarious effect in this movie. However, I'm not going to go as far as some and say this is the be-all and end-all of cinema.This movie was funnier in its concept than its actual script. The casting alone makes you laugh: Chris Rock as an apostle? Those two fresh-faced, gorgeous boys from Good Will Hunting as renegade angels? Alanis as God!? And contrary to what some have said, Jay and Silent Bob just add to the film. Granted, their brand of humor takes a little getting used to...people who think Jay swears too much are missing the point.The acting was well done. Affleck and Damon, as we all know, have great chemistry, as do Jay and Silent Bob- of course. The hockey kids, minions of Jason Lee's superb daemon Azrael, were perfectly creepy, and Chris Rock did his usual outstanding job. Linda Fiorentino fit the role well, but was unfortunately overshadowed by the more exuberant characters. The one true standout was Rickman, who was the voice of reason in the film as Metatron, the stabilizing influence, the central point. Simply incredible.There obviously were some flaws. George Carlin was under-utilized, and Salma Hayek, who I usually love, was pretty bland. And it was also completely misrepresented-- this film in no way goes against Christianity, the divinity of Jesus Christ, but merely organized religion. Again, I'm an atheist, so that didn't appeal to me as much, but Ben Affleck's passionate speeches almost won me over.This is a fascinating film, if not the best ever, definitely worth watching, especially for those familiar with the history of the Catholic church-- sale of indulgences, the Catholic Counter-reformation, and also the fun parts of Christian myth- seraphim, Lucifer's battle, and the like.

356,anonymousfangirl,"Great concept and cast, but has its flaws...",9,7 May 2003,"""Dogma"" was funny and touching and well-written-- I really did love it. The storyline was extremely creative, in Kevin Smith's usual ""comic-like"" style, and there was a nice blend of philosophy and camp. However, this movie is NOT quite the brilliant religious opus everyone seems to think it is...It's neither the work of God or Satan-- it's simply a satire that Mark Twain probably would have appreciated.The cast was decent, with a few standouts...and Linda Fiorentino. She's just...flat for some reason, and I had the same problem with her in ""Men in Black."" I have nothing against her, really, but she's not the world's most convincing actress, and that hurts more when she's playing the main character than when she was an unimportant love interest in a buddy film. A better actress might have improved the film somewhat.Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith were...you know, Jay and Silent Bob. Not much to say there. As always, Smith cast his friends, and Ben Affleck and Matt Damon did an good job in their roles as Bartleby and Loki, the disgraced angels, particularly Affleck's final scene. He showed more range than I'd given him credit for(I already knew Damon could do it.)Chris Rock is one of the standouts-- the man has extraordinary charisma, and even his ""poor black man"" shtick never seems to get old. I was impressed by his skill in a less comedic role.Alan Rickman is brilliant. Is, was, has been, will be...He was as great as the Metatron, Herald of the Almighty, as he is in any of his roles. Maybe Fiorentino would have come off better if so many of her key scenes HADN'T been with Rickman...because the rest of the cast is clearly outshined by the talented Mr. Rickman.

Fresh, witty, original, different, it was great.  The film on the otherhand, is not. Kevin Smith is not one for visual flair, which hurts an effects-laden epic scope film like this.  If a movie is supposed to have an adventure/fantasy feel to it, you can't spend the whole movie talking about stuff and not actually showing it, at least not this way.  ITS A FRIGGIN' ACTION SEQUENCE!!! YOU CAN'T DO THAT SHOESTRING STYLE YOU FOOL!! This film starts off funny enough but is unsuccessful in juxtaposing the humour and drama/violence, and without balance you have dead weight.  The laughs exit quickly and are replaced by...boredom. Whats worse, Mr. Smith's cast is not quite up to snuff this time. Linda Fiorentino is one-note and unengaging. Chris Rock is as always a bad actor, and only looks comfortable when yelling or cussing. Smith himself overdoes it a bit.  And the stygian triplets are in no way menacing.  I'm sure it sounded funny on paper, but its cheap on screen. If Smith had the directing chops and the budget to make this work, it could have been great, but he doesn't. He is a writer first and a director second, and in a dialogue driven film like ""Chasing Amy"", thats all well and good, but not for Dogma.  People really seem to like this film for its open mindedness. Well everyone is open minded to the extent that we're now close minded to actually having opinions about stuff....was that a rant? Never mind.  Mark this down as a disappointment and a could have been classic spoiled by shoddy direction and budget.",Dogma

Kevin Smith wrote a witty, intelligent treatment that exposes the holes in many aspects of Christian faith as practiced in the 21st century.If you read more about the original casting ideas and who ends up in the key roles, there had to be some kind of serendipity in play (no pun intended as there is a character played by Selma Hayak, who reprises her best role as the sultry, seductive stripper in From Dawn to Dusk, named serendipity.) The interplay between Damon and Afflect reveals a comfort level in actors I rarely see. This probably is a result of their longtime working and personal relationship. Despite my appreciation for Jason Lee's acting ability and comedic sense (he was originally selected to play loki, Matt Damon's character)Matt Damon is so committed to his angelic beliefs, his role comes across as completely sincere. The boardroom massacre scene is pure magic. I just love listening to the dialog as it is brilliant.The Alan Rickman character, Metatron, the voice of God, is fantastic as the long suffering shepherd of these humans with all their foibles. ""...I speak to you as Metatron, the voice of god and you don't know who I am, but make a reference to a Charleton Heston movie and suddenly everyone is a theologians...."" Hilarious.

I loved Clerks, was disappointed with Mallrats, was redeemed with Chasing Amy and now he's managed to succeed yet again.  All the actors we've come to know and love are back again.  His troupe, just like Mel Brooks' back in the day, seem to be comfortably in place and know just what he expects from them.  None of them are particularly edgy or give revelatory performances, but they give us what we want and we are entertained and perhaps take a step back and look at some things differently.

Alan Rickman is truly fabulous, as are Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (they should just keep on acting together - they're best when feeding off each other). Dogma has a very intelligent script that goes as far as to be well researched in not only the Catholic church teachings, but the bible too. Throughout the movie, bible passages are quoted and used with all the accuracy of those that are standing outside protesting.All in all, this movie doesn't blaspheme, though it does use foul language (and plenty of it). It definitely does *not* deny God's existence, but more states it as fact. What it does do, which is where most people are probably going to get annoyed, is poke holes in organised religion for religion's sake. The 'going to church just because' brigade are going to be squirming. If you have a spiritual faith that *something* (whatever it may be) is greater than us all, then you'll be fine. If you don't, then you'll be fine. If you're one of those that believe religion should be strictly organised with rules and regulations to follow, and don't dare cross one, then don't bother - you'll only get on your high horse and see how the Catholic church is being 'picked on'. The Catholic church is not being singled out for any rough treatment. The whole DOGMAtic (good huh?) nature of all organised religion is. Even mine.Please go - and go with an open mind.

We both enjoyed the movie but there wasn't much to discuss afterwards.  And post-movie discussion is one of our favorite things. So I feel a little cheated.I have come to expect interesting insights shared by characters in Kevin Smith's films.  Clerks was full of them.  Mall Rats had a few.  And Chasing Amy had enough to satisfy me.  Dogma has its share, but they are difficult to separate from everything else going on.  The great dialog gets lost in the shuffle of giant poop monsters and people falling from the sky.I enjoyed the movie and the message that I took away that human error and misinterpretation does not negate the existence of God.  But I felt like the movie was trying really hard to convince me of something in which I already believe.Some people need a big budget to make a great movie.

366,Jurado,Engaging frolics in Transubstantianism,7,5 August 2000,"Silent Bob and Jay are back once again for another lighthearted comedy. Nothing here really to upset anyone and that's what I wasn't surprised about. I was surprised that people thought there would be. If you look at all films Silent Bob made, there isn't a single one among them that could even remotely be called confrontational to anything. They all have a lightly ironic tone which is mainly aimed against the characters themselves, seldom to the subject matter at hand which in most cases is very little matter to begin with. They provide a backdrop for a lot of funny dialogue which can be outrageous sometimes (as Amy's revelation in Chasing Amy) but always gets downplayed in terms of effect.What bugged me a bit here was that Kevin inserted some New-age aforisms on religion which were not funny and usually a cliche. You get the feeling he put them in to take the sting out of supposedly blasphemous scriptpoints but there's really no sting anyway so it could have done without them.Plotwise the film is a bit messy because there are too many characters to follow here (which is problematic because there's no sub-plot) you kind of lose track and most characters don't get fleshed out as they should have. But all in all this is a film that has many very funny scenes and thank god (or Alanis in this case) for Jay. He becomes the pivotal character in this film, not because he plays an important part in the plot, but because he always provides a delicious touch of moronic genius to scenes which tend to become too heavy-handed or sentimental (especially the final scene).Don't think you will get an insight into religion here, what you will get is a very funny film which doesn't take itself or anything to seriously with very good performances from Ben Affleck (never seen him better), Alan Rickman (never seen him bad in anything) and especially Linda Fiorentino (never see enough of her).",Dogma

Well worth watching, even if you don't get the religious stuff, Chris Rock, Jay Mewes and Kevin Smith are too funny!  More power to Alan Rickman, he had the whole Sheriff of Nottingham thing going again!",Dogma

I had a great time with this film and enjoyed the well thought out characters and ideas explored. Strange to think that people actually ""picketed"" the show. Though, if you check out the news of the time this show was released, then you will find an America that protested at the drop of a hat over many various issues from the monumental to the mundane. Protesting was akin to joining a health club or starting a new diet. Regardless, this show still pierced through the murky haze of blind aggression with its following in the DVD release. Check out the flick that continues to march with its unintentional status, and reminds us all how silly people can be when mob justice rules.",Dogma

It gets into the nitty gritty of religion without wasting so much time on things that complicate he overall point: There may be a God,m and if there is, most people have molded him/her into what they want him/her to be.

If you stay through the entire film, you will understand why Kevin Smith calls this film a redemption story, rather than a gripe fest.  If anything, Dogma makes you think about your own faith, and whether you are living your faith as you should.  It is a little slower than Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy, but it has to be.  The dialogue is well written, but not always delivered very well.  However, the conversations between the characters really make you think about your own faith and what you would do in their situation.  It's got some funny parts, but it is essentially a thought provoking look at what it means to have faith and being true to it.  That's about it.",Dogma

Just barely edging out Clerks.  It's a little bit Hollywood, but the comedy is still intelligent and has an edge.  The acting was excellent, especially from Ben Affleck. Chris Rock isn't his usual annoying self either, very funny.  I never pictured Salma Hayek playing in a Smith film, but she definitely did a great job fitting in.  Smith himself stole the show with facial expressions so good that he didn't even have to speak.  As far as the story line goes, it isn't like any other Smith film, but it does have moments that will remind you of his previous films. It definitely made me think about some of the issues with religion today.  I highly recommend this movie.",Dogma
380,The Woof,Dogma pushes the boundaries for those who can't take a joke,8,20 November 1999,"This new movie from Kevin Smith proves once again what a powerhouse of talent this man has.  He has created a tremendously funny movie that has the religious sector up in arms.  Trouble is, if you are bothered by this type of movie, you simply don't go.  You exercise your right to choose what you wish to view.  Same as you would choose not to see a Rated R film perhaps. 
Anyhow, the movie itself is a kaleidoscope of images that takes you on a journey to a church in New Jersey where there is to be a potential clash of of two Angels who have been kicked out of heaven, and a hodge podge of heroes to try to stop them.  The ""heroes"" are a Rufus the 13th Apostle, The Muse, an unknowing descendant of Christ, and two prophets played by our favorite characters - Jay and Silent Bob.  The two Angels are trying to use a loop hole to get back into Heaven and this is the thrust of the movie. The the actual clash at the end got a bit grandiose, though the movie succeeds on almost every other level.There are laughs all through this film which provokes one to also think a bit on some of the aspects of religion itself.  Don't think too hard though or you'll miss some very funny stuff.  The film stars Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, George Carlin, Linda Fiorentino, Salma Hayek, Chris Rock, and a host of others, including many favorites from other Smith films.Reserve judgment until you see the movie.  If you are a fan of film you will like this movie for what it does despite what religious critics say.  Take a chance and see one of the best comedies this year.

So boring and unfunny that during the movie I started to think about my dental surgery the next day (Yes, THAT bad!)There is no coherence in this story which thus renders this film into small little bits and sight-gags, most of which are puerile.  The biggest error in ""Dogma"" is that Kevin Smith did not adequately develop the story around the Bethany character (Linda Fiorentino) and instead focused on the many useless side characters.As for the Catholic angle--who cares!  I sure didn't.  This movie was too lame to offend my lapsed Catholic sensibilities.  It was smart of the Catholic Church to not officially picket this film as it would have brought unwarranted attention to such an undeserved movie.In sum:  A very disappointing film.

I mean, it was a Kevin Smith film, featured an all-star cast, and was supposed to be extremely controversial.  What i found was a poorly filmed, contrived story powered by inane babbling and few real laughs.  Smith really struck out on this one. His lack of style with the camera is painfully evident, as he tries to film action scenes and special effects shots.  This lack of finesse was acceptable within the framework of his other films, but not with this one. The musical score was another low point in the film, for it was no more than a generic musical filler.  This film lacked the low-budget charm of Clerks, fell short from the ridiculous comedy of Mallrats, and came nowhere close to the poignancy and raw emotional energy of Chasing Amy.  Not to mention, Selma Hayek even has cellulite in this movie.  Very disappointing, and definitely forgettable.",Dogma
383,diviner,An uncreative and pretentious attempt to satirise religion.,3,31 December 1999,"Kevin Smith's Dogma is an uncreative and pretentious attempt to satirise religion.  His ""disclaimer"" prologue was nothing more than grade-school smart-alec humour, the same attitude carries on until the film closes.Dogma is about two fallen angels who have found a loop-hole which would get them back to Heaven.  In fact, the whole movie is about loop-holes.  Smith frequently uses obscure Biblical passages to advance the plot.  As a result, the film quickly loses its momentum, and I could not help feeling dragged.The issues raised by various characters throughout the movie (e.g., Is Jesus black?  Is God female, etc.,) are nothing out of the ordinary if not trivial.  There is absolutely no intelligence or inspiration to them. Sunday school teachers probably get questions like these almost every other week.Finally, there is the ending.  I won't give anything away (I am quite sure you'd know by now,) but it simply has the word ""Hubris"" written all over.All in all, Smith's portrayal of religion in Dogma is not only immature. It also shows that, like his wallet, his wit is growing thicker by the day. Even a quasi-all-star cast won't save the world of Dogma from Armageddon.",Dogma

I saw Mallrats and Clerks (loved both movies) before watching this movie, and I expected something truly great from Smith, even if I was a little offended. Just the opposite happened, however, and I left this movie (and I sat through every minute) disturbed and wondering what may have possessed Kevin Smith to make this horrible picture.

392,ayed,Comedic critique of religion,8,18 November 1999,"Yeah, I enjoyed it.  Did it shock my sensibilities?  No, but then again, I'm a pretty jaded 30-ish type.  Is Kevin Smith being sincere when he says that he doesn't understand why religious organizations are protesting the film? I hardly think so.  There are bits in the film that seem specifically designed to tweak sensitive religious types.  That's OK with me -- I agree that God must have a good sense of humor -- but there is no way that Kevin Smith was surprised at the reaction he got.Basically, the film is a Kevin Smith comedy where the contextual background is provided by his views on orthodoxy and religion rather than, say, shopping malls or convenience stores.  I'm willing to wager that not one of the protesters has actually seen this film; hey, if you actually had an informed, rationally thinking brain, why would you waste your time getting hung up on some celluloid?  Wouldn't you notice that such protests do little more than boost box office tallies?  whatever.All that aside, I gave it 7/10 -- strong on the comedy (though with some sophomoric diversions that weren't really necessary) and decent in its critique of institutionalized religion as a force sapping the belief and spirituality out of individualized faith.  But do these things peacefully co-exist in the film?  I'm not so sure.  There is an inherent disconnect when a comedy tackles weighty issues -- you've never really sure if the filmmaker was making a social commentary with comedic elements or a comedy with elements of social commentary.  The result is a somewhat diminished focus and hence power to the finished work.  Still, I'd give it a try -- unless your deepest held beliefs are threatened by a few crass jokes, that is.",Dogma

Don't get me wrong, it's got some good laughs and for the most part it's pretty entertaining, but in choosing to make a film about religion, Smith has trapped himself in the ""Dogma.""There are only so many cliche questions and answers that can be used in a religious discussion.  Unfortunately, Smith uses them all.  I was hoping this film would be clever, possibly even enlightening on some religious level. But it wasn't.  Smith's script uses every overstated argument, every stereotypical Bible bashing comment that I've heard used a million times. Who hasn't heard the ""Jesus was black"" argument.  What's new about the rips on organized religion: ""It doesn't matter what church you belong to, just as long as you live a good life, treat others with kindness"" blah blah blah. Whether Smith is espousing these beliefs, or merely mocking them, they're still old and dull and over used.  Instead of any subtleties, Smith beats us over the head with his ""Dogma.""

A really good vehicle to explore religion and have a good laugh.  It does achieve this aim to some degree, but I just think there was too much other stuff thrown into the plot for no reason.  Also, there were far too many characters, so by the end there were you were trying to follow about 9 or 10 people, most of who weren't needed. The whole thing became a bit muddled for me.

Two outcasted angels, Bartleby (Affleck) and Loki (Damon)are sentenced to spend the rest of eternity in a place worse than Hell (Wisconson!) when a certain Catholic church proclaims that whom ever steps through the arch of that church, their souls will be restored and will go to Heaven if they die. The two angels, who are determined to get back into Heaven, are desperate enough to try it. The only problem is that them going back into Heaven would show a flaw in God's (Alanis Morresate) plan and would erase all of existense.

Others that help are the over looked 13th apostle Rufus (Rock), the stoner prophets Jay (Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith), and the stripper Muse Serendipity (Hayek). The casting was great. Although Fiorentino's performance was a LITTLE weak, I still can't picture anyone else playing Bethany. Alan Rickman rocked, as he usually does.

The movie tried to be a series of goofy situations with a ridiculous plot line, but it never pushed the limit and it didn't make enough of a comparison to the bible. Kevin Smith's style of using conversational humor and trying to make the audience feel like a fried of the characters in the movie doesn't really work with topical humor.

Affleck, as Bartleby, laments that God has not given angels the same gift of free will that (s)he has given man, and that many humans are so ungrateful for this richest of gifts that they do not even acknowledge the donor.  In another scene, Salma Hayek, as a stripper-muse, instructs us that ""It is not as important what we believe in, as that we believe in something.""  I began to feel that this was a spiritually enlightened movie.But in the end, the film disappoints, as screenwriter/director Kevin Smith cops out.  Having pointed out the absurdity of doctrines propounded by twenty centuries of power-hungry, sexually frustrated old men, Smith and most of his ethereal cast retreat, physically or figuratively, into the cold, imprisoning womb of Holy Mother the Church.  It's obvious to me that the Catholic League protesters have not seen this film; if they had, they would be celebrating it as a paean to the Catholic faith rather than an outrage.  In my view, it's nothing more than a tease - a very funny tease, but a tease nonetheless.",Dogma
412,Dirk-31,Innacurate,3,5 December 1999,"Only wanted to point out that its movie, though touted as being very knowledgable in the area of Catholic Theology, has many errors that should be pointed out.1.The Catholic church cannot forgive the sins of angels.  Humans are the only creatures that fall under the church's jurisdiction in that area.2.An indulgence only works if the recipient is actually sorry for their sins.  This may be the case in this movie, but should be noted for accuracies's sake.3.Angels cannot become humans.4. Angels are annatomically correct.  The book of Genesis records how angels and mortal women had children together.  Hence the angels must have had some kind of genitalia.5. Muses are not part of Catholic theology.  They are part of Greek myth.6. Loki is the name for the Norse God of mischief, not the name of an angel.That said, I would like to express my dislike for the self-pity that Linda Forentino's character shows.  She merely follows the pattern of people who blame God for their own choices.  She made a conscious choice to have sex, then to have an abortion, which led to her predicament at the start of the movie, so she illicits no sympathy from me. I did like Alan Rickman's part though.",Dogma
413,FMRadio,Missed potential,3,22 February 2001,"I'm not a big Kevin Smith fan to begin with so I'm not surprised I didn't really dig this movie. But I actually went in expecting to enjoy this movie. Great cast and a great concept! Unfortunately, the movie was as preachy as it was funny, which negated the humour much of the time. I felt like I was watching a movie pushing religious theology that was cleverly concealed as a comedy. They could have made the same references without constantly having to explain to the audience why ""they're right and you're wrong"" and pulled it off much better. What hurts most is seeing how much potential this movie had and knowing that it didn't just miss the boat, it didn't even make it to the dock. As it stands, the script was sorely self-destructive and seemed like it was made mainly with trying to force someone's own religious ideals rather than really trying to entertain. I didn't really find it offensive, although I can understand how some may see it as such. It was simply that it felt like an am-way party where you get duped into going, thinking its a real party, and sure, they throw a few treats to add to the party atmosphere but you're really just there to get sold something. And Linda Fiorentino's acting was TERRIBLE in this movie! And in such a prominent role, it really stood out. I think she ruined the movie more than the preaching. I thought she was somewhat blase in ""Men in Black"" but in this movie, you just get the feeling the whole time that she's not really trying or that her mind is elsewhere. I wouldn't normally make such a big deal of someone's acting but she was the female LEAD. Save for Chris Rock, whose display revealed his comedy strength is NOT following a script word for word, everyone else did a terrific job.So again, if you aren't easily offended by religious comedy and can easily get passed the sell job, go for it. But be forewarned. Its not for everyone.",Dogma

There is none of the biting wit, none  of the intellect. There is no deep message here, only a little  praise of faith.  We don't Kevin to preach the faith message to us, we need him to make us laugh. 
He even manages to make Chris Rock UNFUNNY.  That in itself is more of a ""miracle"" than the story in this mess.  The only redeeming factor is casting Alannis as God.  That was a really nice touch.  Go out and rent ""Chasing Amy"" instead.",Dogma
415,Alizaria,This movie is terrible!,1,24 November 1999,"Where are the positive reviews coming from? This movie is terrible! The acting was incredibly wooden, like an underrehearsed skit that went on for 2 hours intercut with idiotic scenes of carnage. How many times did 5 or 6 characters just sit around explaining elaborate supernatural rules to each other? That might have been funny if the script were well written and if Selma Hayek could act just a little, but it wasn't. And poor Ben Affleck, trying to act up a storm: was this supposed to be dramatic? It was just out of place and dumb. And Alanis Morrisette as God might have been funny if all the reviews hadn't revealed this plot point and if George Burns hadn't already milked the joke of an unlikely pop celebrity as God years ago. I was horribly bored at this movie and may have set a record for times I looked at my watch.

I myself am Catholic, albeit not a strict adherist to the ways of the religion, but still practice some of its ways.  I should read the script again, but I didn't find myself offended because of these anti-catholic remarks, which I never really saw. This film NEEDS to be released.  Not because of the opposition of the Catholic League, but because we need to see the work of these great young actors and those few older ones(Alan Rickman).

Therefore, I don't see any real point in trying to overstate how great Clerks is, and the unimpressive yet harmless Mallrats all but confirms that for me. Clerks seems to be some kind of watershed for ""slacker/DYI"" comedy when it's simply a movie about New Jersey kids with some funny dialogue - and there's nothing wrong with that.Dogma struck me as the first *film* Smith has yet made. There's something to it that doesn't exist in Clerks, Mallrats or Chasing Amy. It doesn't need Jason Lee and Jay & Silent Bob to carry it like in previous Smith movies. This film definitely takes advantage of the great cast of celebrities & personalities, but there is *something* driving it all - an interesting storyline and a subject that intrigues people (and I'm not even referring to the more sensational/controversial Catholic baiting either).Dogma isn't **4 stars great,** but it's kind of cool because now I can maybe see Smith as more than a simple yet creative Jersey guy who really digs comics ""and stuff.""",Dogma

424,nufffairy,More Kevin Smith Mayhem,9,29 November 2001,"From start to finish this film is thoroughly entertaining.  Even though there are disclaimers at the beginning, I still reckon that Catholics will enjoy this as much as the atheiests - perhaps even more, considering the so many references to different aspects of the Christian religion.Basically this is a story not unlike but not all that similar to films along the `Prophecy' line, regarding two angels played by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon who, after being banished from heaven, discover a `loop hole' that will allow them to re-enter their paradise - the only problem is, if they succeed in their plans, they'll unmake all that their maker has made - if that makes sense.The ideas in this film, apart from seeming like far out conspiracy theories, actually make a tad of sense.  For example, why in the Bible does it not mention Jesus' life from ages 12 to 30?  Could it be that Jesus had to mature and deal with the fact that he was God's only son, or was it a cover up for the family or Mary who possibly had more children, to make her appear more pure?With the usual cast to be expected from Kevin Smith, plus some (well one) pretty surprising extra - this film is even more enjoyable than his previous films, including Clerks, Mall Rats and Chasing Amy.Jay and Silent Bob were outstanding as usual - the only problem I found with the pair, was not knowing which to focus on - on the big screen. A small amount of the dialogue was a little fast for my ears, but the entire amount that I did hear was thoroughly enjoyable, humourous and witty.More of the story?  Ok. There's this woman, who's been nominated to, for reasons cleverly explained in the movie, stop the two outlaw angels from reaching their holy destination.  Along her journey, which begins with her meeting Allan Rickman's character, `the voice of God' and two prophets (Jay and Silent Bob), she accidentally it seems forms a posse, composing also of Chris Rock as the 13th apostle and Salma Hayek, playing the muse.Together with the angels, the mortals, the whole deal, they make their pilgrimage or crusade a most humourous expedition, with a few surprises at the end.  You'll never guess what face `God' picks to show up in.unless someone has already told you.

I was, however, bitterly disappointed in the final result.There were certainly some good one-liners in the film, and I did laugh out loud more than once.  The premise itself was humorous, and had a lot of potential.  Even so, the end product fell fall short of quality movie making.The script simply dragged.  The plot kept getting more and more complicated with no benefit to the overall story.  New characters were continually introduced for no better reason than to give big name actors a role in the movie.  With each new character came a new mythical label: a fallen angel, a demon, a muse.  It's as though having a hip station in the afterlife was an appropriate substitute for thoughtful screen writing.  For the most part, these characters contributed nothing to the piece other than a few diverting one-liners and allowed the producers to put marketable names on the marquee.Another problem I had with the piece (and this has been a consistent problem in all of Kevin Smith's movies), is that it was too scripted.  Much of the dialog between the characters was nothing more than actors exchanging rehearsed speeches.  There is nobody to blame here but Kevin, who both wrote and directed this waste of celluloid.At the end, I was begging for the credits.

Instead, ideas meant to be thought provoking: Christ was black, God is a women, etc. seem only cliche.My next complaint is about the performances.  They were fairly poor, filled with unconvincing vocal inflections.  Linda Fiorentino was really quite painful to watch - she has all the range of your average junior high drama club member.  Matt Damon, Chris Rock, Jason Lee and Salma Ha-yuck provided poor performances to watch when Linda wasn't speaking.On the plus side, Ben Affleck and Alan Rickman did good jobs with their parts.

Smith has brilliantly juxtaposed deep religious discourse with sophomoric cheap laughs.I've read other comments here, and I must say that many people seem to be missing the point. Smith did not ""reduce"" his theological treatise to a sequence of crude jokes. This would not explain the fact that for every time Jay hits on Fiorentino's character, there is a scene of straight, unashamed, unadulterated, serious theological dialog. If it were really worthless drivel, then why would it feature a Catholic who works at an abortion clinic and is dealing with a crumbling faith? That's not easy material. To trash this movie for Smith's keeping with his style is to throw away a true attempt to bring theology to the masses. He has managed to ask truly difficult questions and pry into deep territory, and at once make it accessible to the average sitcom-raised American without dumbing it down.And if you're Catholic, that's all the more reason to see this movie: written by Catholics for Catholics. (You just have to learn to laugh at yourself; that's always a very healthy thing anyway.)(And, as Smith himself says, DON'T take it too seriously. Alanis Morisette is there as a good old, unexpected cameo appearance; Chris Rock is there because he's hilarious; Jay and Bob are there because that's Smith's schtick and people relate to them.

448,rpmohriii,Possibly the worst film I've ever seen,1,14 November 2003,"The notion that adjectives like ""great"", ""thought provoking"", ""genius"" or anything of the sort is laughable.  This film is simply unwatchable.Upon seeing this film in the theatres I was fairly impressed with earlier Kevins Smith efforts Chasing Amy and Clerks, additionally I consider myself to be somewhat of a ""recovering Catholic"" with many of my own criticisms.During my viewing I couldn't believe how much my butt hurt or how often I looked at my watch.I can't think of one redeeming quality of this film whatsoever.  First and foremost, unlike other Smith films it is completely unfunny.  If poop jokes and rehashed Carlin routines strike you as original or funny get some taste. The pacing of this film is a snooze fest.  It's such a mess that I'd go so far to say that it wasn't directed, as opposed to poorly directed.  The lighting, blocking, and acting would be more at home in a gradeschool video project. To even utter the word cinematic to this film would leave Orson Welles rolling in his grave. Seriously.What strikes me as more ironic is the idea that this movie ""makes you think"" or is insightful in any way.  It's hopelessly juvenile!  This film makes overly obvious and pre-adolescent points about Christianity and offers nothing interesting whatsoever.  It's alleged groundbreaking criticitiques were unclear at bes.  If you find this insightful...sit at a local IHOP and watch stoners have delusional conversations for 3 hours...that's the sum total of this movie experience. What religious points was this film evening trying to make?  One wonders if anyone who found this provoking has ever seen films like Wings of Desire, The Last Temptation of Christ, WickerMan...or even the Exorcist.Moreover, I can't understand the controversy surrounding this film AT ALL. This is a prime case for the argument where unwarranted controversy only stirs up  interest in an undeserving cultural piece of ""art"".To me this seems like another example of our ever-lowering standards and lack of intellect in this culture.  If this passes for insightful and/or funny it's no wonder Jim Belushi is prospering.Simply put...an extremely boring, uninteresting, unfunny, amateurish and unnecessarily long movie.  Through film school and a lifetime of viewing thousands upon thousands of titles this easily ranks among the worst efforts I've ever seen.

Moreover, an intelligent film that didn't have to rely on endless special effects. It should have been great. So why then did I get so bored half way through? There was just too much talking, too my theology (they seemed to be trying to get a mention to just about everyone in the Bible ) The film moved away from the original idea,ie that it was supposed to be a work of ENTERTAINMENT. Half way through it stopped being funny and became a theological exercise. I almost expected that there was going to be a quiz at the end!

The film had numerous characters from different religions, like: Azrael, Bartleby, etc. All the character were portrayed very well too, and the actors did a good job playing out their roles. This movie had a lot of references to other View Askew movies, as well as the Holy Bible itself, if you can catch all the allusions, you can really appreciate Kevin Smith's style of writing and directing. The movie is laced with disk jokes that are amazingly relevant to religion.

A film like this does not need to have a killer DP, it shines in one other place that few films today care about. To this day, I still insist that Smith's dialoge is the best in the buisness.

454,kookytree,Terrible,1,7 October 2003,"I'm not sure what I find harder to believe- the idea that people actually found this film funny, or the fact that it is considered controversial. This is ""satire"" at the level of the Carry On films- when a film uses a giant ""poo monster"" for supposed comedic effect, you know your time is wasted on it. I watched this expecting to chuckle, instead I came out feeling nauseated and patronised. At least half an hour of the film -AT LEAST- is spent with characters explaining the plot background and details to other characters. Can you say yawn? This is the first Kevin Smith movie I've seen and the man is the biggest overwriter I've had the displeasure of coming across. The characters just cannot shut up! This would be fine if the dialogue was witty or insightful, but instead it's lots and lots of swearing (the word ""f~ck loses it's already minimal impact after the fiftieth time you hear it in one scene), and supposedly deep religious discussions that are immature and sound as if they were written by a twelve year old who just became interested in theology.It's near impossible to see who this film appeals to- Smith shoots for pleasing all and ends up satisfying none. Those who enjoy the childish, ""Dude Where's My Brain"" jokes will no doubt be crushingly bored when the characters decide to sit and talk inanely about something unfunny -AGAIN, while those who like the pathetic attempts at religious satire and discussion of the Catholic Church will cringe at the afore mentioned poo monster and a succession of equally puerile kindergarten comedy.
The film is nowhere near as clever or anarchic as it thinks it is (indeed it has incredibly tame messages), and the characters are obnoxious. The protagonist -a female, distant relation of Christ- whinges so damn much you want to slap her overacting face. Indeed, pretty much every person in the film overacts- only Alanis (the only person with no lines- significant?) and Salma Hayek (who's a decent comic performer- `That's why he's The King, and you're a schmuk') come out with dignity intact. I should also say Silent Bob's expressions are pretty amusing, as are the odd one liners in Jay's rants. However, while Ben Affleck isn't as bad as he can be, he's still pretty terrible, and Matt Damon does an impressive impression of wallpaper throughout. When the film shoots for drama it's embarrassing. When the two fallen angels have an argument and one compares the other to Lucifer, we're supposed to take it seriously, but the poor writing and acting make it an utter non-moment. At one point, the protagonist, after another annoying rant (which I'm assuming is Smith's amateurish way of getting across how his characters feel, as this is an insanely whiny bunch of people) actually runs, drops on her knees in the rain, and screams up the sky `WHY, GOD!?!?!?! WHHHHHHHHHHHY!?!?!?' This was one of the only genuine laughs I got from the film, it's an utter cliché and this supposedly ironic, clever-clever film tries to use it as drama: worrying.Again, I ask, who actually found this controversial? Bible Belt Christians? Devout Catholics? Those same groups find 'HARRY POTTER' controversial, it's hardly an achievement. The only other thing I could see as being controversial was the pushing of the pro-choice abortion movement, and while I am pro-choice, such plugging made me uneasy, as pro-lifers are demonised in the film somewhat unfairly. If Smith is going to enter the abortion debate, which is inadvisable in the first place for a film most likely to appeal to wannabe `alternative' folk gagging to prove their anti-establishment leanings, it should at least be fair and give the points of both sides. It's also obvious that the man directing is a Catholic himself, and the film comes across as just more self-loathing, rambling apologies from a liberal, middle-class, white male for the perceived wrongs his ancestors have done to the world. If there was any satire in the film, I didn't catch it- was the scene where God made all the bodies disappear satirical? Worryingly, it appears not. Besides, satirising the farcial exploits of the Catholic Church is about as hard as exhaling carbon dioxide.The film, though, isn't a total waste of time. There are some nice points- the boredom of church-going is articulated adroitly, for example, and there are one or two funny moments. The conceit of the relative of Christ not being able to have children and thus losing faith in God is actually a great idea, but it's poorly executed in the extreme. The dialogue/writing is terrible for the most part (the characters talk too much about the story and/or themselves, and do too little), the acting equally dire, and -most criminally- it's simply not funny. `Dogma' commits the ultimate sin: for a movie packed with such dumb jokes, it sure takes itself seriously. If you want to watch a comedy, a satire, or even a discussion of religion or theology, there is surely better stuff than this.",Dogma
455,marperra,A fantatheological comedy,7,7 July 2003,"(MILD SPOILERS) Everybody knows that when this film came out in USA a noisy minority of Catholics protested against, crying blasphemy. Far few knows that in overwhelmingly Catholic Italy the movie came out only four years later, in the dead summer season, and without any publicity. Judge yourself the satanic blasphemies of Dogma:Jesus had brothers and sisters (what a coincidence, last Saturday Gospel talks about them) which are born from the marriage love of Mary and Joseph, just like each of us.God chooses two amoral and foul-mouthed misfits as prophets (just like many Bible prophets).There was a 13th black apostle, (I think he is just a disciple who is boasting) who says that Jesus was black (probably He was not, but He had neither the Scandinavian whiteness we represent him with.)God is a skee-ball fanatic (every American Christian knows that God loves baseball).God can reveal Himself as a nice and smart-looking girl (Alanis Morrisette). (Are you allowing God to manifest Himself as He likes? Or are you checking the gender of the burning bush? On the other hand, I admit that thinking that God has the bad taste of wearing orange sandals and tartan boxers borders on blasphemy).I think that this film shows Smith's deep faith, even with his usual ironic and laid-down style, and gently mocking some too-literal religious thinking. How many movies have you seen that say that God loves men more than angels, in spit of the evil that men do, and even if some don't believe Him exists? Or  that faith is a gift, not a burden, which has to be celebrated, not mourned? Or that God has a great sense of humour (I's been always sure of it)?The plot is one of the most original I've ever seen; two angels (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck), banished to Earth for having rebelled to God, find a way to regain Heaven; earning a plenary indulgence, on the occasion of the re-consacration of a church. If they'll succeed, they'll proved that God is fallible, and all the Creation will cease to exist. To prevent this, Metatron, the messenger of God (Alan Rickman), appears to a woman (Linda Fiorentino) and asks her to stop them. In this quest the women is helped by the 13th apostle, two prophets (Smith's regular characters Jay e Silent Bob), and a muse (Salma Hayek) who inspired all the highest-grossing movies, except ""Home alone"" (`Somebody sold their soul to Satan to get the grosses up on that piece of s***."").Best acting comes from Affleck, whose character evolves smoothly from a calm and sensible guy into a blood-thirsty demon, and Rickman, which keeps an understated tone, and carries both the funniest and the most moving scene in the film (how'd you react if you saw an angel in a pillar of fire in your bedroom? and how do you think Jesus took the news that he was destined to die in deep pain for the redemption of mankind?). I liked also Jason Lee as the elegant devil who wants to undo the Universe.It's not a flawless film: Smith delivers the most important messages with monologues that break the rhythm; the biblical slaughter before the ending is justified by the plot, but it has a tone too far from the rest of the film. But it deals in a very original way with an important theme, and makes you both think and laugh, something quite unusual in these days.7/10",Dogma

Even though the central them is that there is a god, but not necessarily the god people know, think or believe in. The characters are trying to get the message that we have changed from a original god, that we have made god into a image we want him or her to be. With the thought that we have created our own religious rules some that god may never have intended or created. This film does poke a little fun at the institution that is the catholic church without showing disdain. It more embraces religion and points out problems that can occur with any religious institution.

459,nurit-horak,A revolutionary film that invents new mythology,8,27 January 2015,"""Dogma"" is a comedy from the creator Kevin Smith (1999), a director that tends to create genre cult films that often displays plots with supernatural themes, and grotesque characters.In ""Dogma"" Smith criticize organized religion, primarily the Catholic faith, while presenting new biblical characters like the denied Christ's apostles Rufus that was not mentioned in the New Testament because he is a black man (Chris Rock). But ""Dogma"" does more than inventing new mythology. It seems to also include an important discussion on issues of gender as it presents images of women that challenge the existing order, and 'men' and 'Women' that actually don't have any sex organs and their gender identity is in doubt. This discussion is not unusual to science- fiction and fantasy movies and TV shows today (especially the works of creators like Joss Whedon), but in my opinion this was quite innovative in the year in which the film was made.The muse and other supernatural beings in the film are portrayed as sexless (except Rufus). The Two angels and God's voice don't have sexual organs. The angel Loki (Damon) even complains about his inability to masturbate and Metatron (the God's voice) says that in heaven the act of sex is considered a joke.The revolutionary aspect of the film is expressed most notably in God character. Throughout the film, a discussion is being held between the characters whether God is male or female when every time he/she ""are"" treated differently. God as he / she is represented in the film as a creature that combines the two genders and rises above them so it does not really matter what is the truth and the ongoing discussion in the movie as it is presented by Smith is futile and ridiculous..The film passes the Bechdel test. It presents a number of main women characters who talk among themselves even though for most of the film the main character (who is a woman) speaks primarily with male characters.",Dogma

Oh yeah, he forgot one more thing:  a character that doesn't talk like he does.  Dogma is more a compilation of Kevin Smith's self-chosen greatest quips than anything that even remotely resembles a coherent movie.  I suppose he thinks he's taregting the Catholic church with this meandering, miserable grab bag of gross-out and piss-off anti-religious sentiment, but in the end, it just amounts to a desperate, simple-minded lucture from a man with absolutely nothing to say about the topic he's chosen to discuss.  God is a woman.  Jesus is African-America. The Second Coming works in an abortion clinic.  And this is what passes for bold in today's multiplex.  Somewhere lost in all this safer-than-safe political correctness is any rhyme or reason.  There's a couple of fallen angels slaughtering churchgoers, God getting beaten half to death by Satanic pygmy skate-rats on a Jersey Shore boardwalk, a nun getting talked out of her faith, a fecies monster being neutralized with a can of air-freshener, a violent gang banger being soothed by the Fat Albert theme song, and people falling from the sky on cue, over and over again.  It's a comedy, I think. What's it not is funny.  Or interesting.  Or entertaining.  It's like watching some lonely kid in the back of the classroom trying to get the other kids to look at him.

This flick tackles organized religion like a fat woman tackles a three pound ham sandwich.  The Catholic faith is somewhat criticized, but the criticsms are light.  By listening to William Donahue and the Catholic League, you'd think this movie was about Ben Affleck and Matt Damon p***ing on the Pope.

467,zvelf-2,"Better than Chasing Amy, but that's not saying much",5,5 October 1999,"Kevin Smith is like a big kid.  His humor is that of a sophisticated juvenile's.  He grew up idolizing Star Wars and loves comic books, having allso written a few.  He also has a cult following, mostly composed of teenagers, college students, and Smith's own fellow adolescent-minded grownups.  Smith is hilarious in person and in writing, but when he tries to be earnest and moralize, that is when he goes wrong.  I think Kevin Smith is a better writer than director.Great directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them.  This was true in the overrated Chasing Amy, and it is true for Dogma as well. That is not to say Smith's message is a bad one.  In Dogma, Smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into God and God's desires is superior to anyone else's.  Basically, dogmatism is bad.  Changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible, and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight, they also know what is best for you, whether you like it or not.  This is not exactly a new message in movies (see Inherit the Wind), but I have no problems with recycling old ones, particularly since Dogma's protesters are proving Smith's point.  Smith's own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a Dogma for Dummies book.  But this is Smith's personality, and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the Bible (or Koran, etc.) correctly (or if there even is a correctly) and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns.The story concerns abortion clinic worker Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) being chosen by Voice of God, Metatron (Alan Rickman), to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels, Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and Angel of Death, Loki (Matt Damon).  Along the way, forgotten thirteenth Apostle, Rufus (Chris Rock), stripper muse Serendipity (Salma Hayek), and slacker duo Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith himself) come to Bethany's aid.  Fallen muse, Azrael (Jason Lee), proves to be the behind-the-scenes manipulator for all the chicanery.The logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make Smith's points, and in itself, has little dramatic momentum.  Among the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that God is a woman, Jesus was black, and the Bible was written by a bunch of racist, misogynistic white men.  Of course, Kevin Smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself.  They are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic.  Smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie.  When Harvey Weinstein asked Smith to put it into the film before Cannes, Smith thought it might give validation to protesters' claims that the film was sacrilegious, but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke.The film's humor is uneven.  Some parts are very funny as when Bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when Metatron makes a burning-bush kind of entrance. But many of the film's jokes just bomb, as in virtually anything involving Salma Hayek's Serendipity.  Also, some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away.  Still, Smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace.  Among the actors, Fiorentino and Rickman stand out by far. Fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight.  >",Dogma

It is a foul-mouthed, pop culture Kevin Smith flick, a bit of a mystery, a great road movie -without the stale coming of age elements- and, of course, it is a grand religious epic.  If you need verification on that last one just reread the bible and notice all the merciless killing and blood and guts.  The movie ultimately works because the religious stuff is structured into its own reality and Smith never acts like he doesn't believe that reality.  Sure its played for laughs, but he doesn't change the rules midstream.

One thing that Kevin Smith does brilliantly is create characters.  He does this better than any writer or director I have ever seen.  All of the characters in each of his movies are so vastly different and have such distinct traits it's hard not to be amused.  The other thing that impresses me constantly about Smith's films is the dialogue.  Vulgar?  Yes.  Somewhat juvenile at times?  Yes.  Clever? Yes.  People praise Quentin Tarantino and Robert Altman also for creating great characters and witty dialogue.  If you are one of those people, you will be blown away by Dogma.  I was mildly amused with Clerks, laughed heartily at Mallrats, was somewhat bored with Chasing Amy, and...my impression after seeing Dogma?

That is how other people leaving the theatre put it, and so eloquently too.Up to now this comment has been mostly mindless babble about the details of the movie, but let's get to it.

I really thought that Kevin Smith couldn't make a worse film than 'Chasing Amy' until I saw 'Dogma'.  Never mind the fact that there's no plot except for some reason it's FINALLY time for the End of the World, the acting is horrible, the writing is childish and the overall package is a rancid patchwork of eyewinks and innuendos.  It's really hard to say who gives the worst performance because it seems as though the script was written for just such a contest in mind.

474,jmabel,One more way of annoying the Vatican,7,20 December 1999,"The apocalyptic comedy ""Dogma"" is not a consistent film. Like Álex de la Iglesia's ""Day of the Beast"", it starts off strong, but fades.  While it maintains full speed very far into the film, the apocalyptic ending plays like (dare I say it) something out of ""Clerks"".  But it is still worth watching.Unlike intellectual ex-Protestants, who typically become simply secular, most intellectual ex-Catholics still feel the need to grapple with a rich maze of doctrine and dogma. (Besides ""Day of the Beast"", the same phenomenon can be observed in Godard's ""Hail Mary""). Although a few random non-Catholic elements find their way into ""Dogma"" (a muse, the name ""Loki""), it is a very Catholic film, little though the church will like it.  Whereas Samuel Jackson's Vengeful God in ""Pulp Fiction"" is doubtless a Protestant God or perhaps an Old Testament God, part of the fun of ""Dogma"" is that is supposes an unquestionably Catholic God, then sneaks in Alanis Morisette at the end to portray a God totally unrecognizable to the Catholic tradition.I like the idea of there being multiple factions in the fight between Heaven and Hell, an Azrael rebelling against even Lucifer, amoral angels walking the earth mired in the technicalities of dogma, seeking loopholes in doctrine, messing with the natives for lack of any other way to pass the time.The film is visually well conceived (if never riveting - perfectly good to catch this on video), the acting is generally good (although Salma Hayek's acting falls rather short of her beauty), there are enough twists and turns to keep any but the most hyperactive mind paying attention, and (rather unusually for an American movie) it actually expects its audience to know something and to be paying attention.",Dogma

Unfortunately there aren't enough ideas within the film to sustain its length, and it isn't smart or intriguing enough to hold one's attention for a whole two hours. Various religious doctrines are mocked cleverly but the same joke is used too often. I laughed the first time but in the end I was just bored.The ending seems to take hours to arrive. The idea of Alanis Morisette as God is a good one (although the joke works for almost any personality you can think) but it only works for a few seconds. The same is true with much of the film.The acting in this film is very good, particularly from Alan Rickman. No matter how good the acting is, it can't transform a bad film into a good one.After Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Clerks, this was a very disappointing outing.",Dogma
476,ljc3,"Nice dialogue, clumsy direction.",6,6 February 2000,"I must confess to rather a weakness for Kevin Smith's films. 'Clerks' was great for a low-budget comedy, 'Mallrats' was amusing, and 'Chasing Amy' is his best work so far - engaging, personal, touching...'Dogma' should have been better - for one thing Smith had a bigger budget and a wider audience, but sadly, he doesn't seem to know what to do with it. He excels at what he normally does, ie. dialogue, but sadly, the film is too large-scale for the guy to direct. He does not know how to film a road-movie, which 'Dogma', in part, should be. The characters travel halfway across America - and what evidence do we have to prove this? One three-minute scene outside a broken-down car on the highway and quite a few shots in diners and the insides of trains... Never any landscape shots showing to create a feeling of space or how much distance has been covered.Smith as screenwriter seems immersed in some personal joke. Sure, often he is funny, but bringing out Jay and Silent Bob for a WHOLE FILM is somewhat stretching the point. They are wonderful cameo characters, but they do not make for an entire two hours entertainment. Despite their near-constant appearance in front of the camera they do little to forward the plot. Smith has a long way to go before he achieves real sophistication.That said, there is no doubting just how amusing this film is. The premise is wonderful and for the most part the performances are spot-on. Alan Rickman is wonderful as the world-weary Metatron (Voice of God) and Matt Damon and Ben Affleck do another decent double-act.A fun, if technically poor, movie.",Dogma

I actually wanted the DVD version but it was sold out everywhere (good sign?). in the film we meet the two fallen angels Loki & Bartleby (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) that has been expelled from heaven and set to wander the earth till the end of time in the worlds most horrible place.....Wisconsin! unfortunately, God overlooked the possibility of a shortcut back to heaven, and if Loki and Bartleby should be able to find it, that would prove that god is not perfect and makes mistakes, and then the entire world will come to an end. To solve the situation, Gods voice (Alan Rickman) goes to see the unfaithfull catholic girl Bethany, who works at an abortion clinic, only to tell her that she is the one who is going to save the universe! With a little help from a muse (Salma Hayek), two unlikely prophets Jay & Silent Bob plus the thirteenth apostle Rufus (who still is a little  upset about not being mentioned in the bible, cause he is black), the fearless trio plus 2, are going to New Jersey, to save the world. The movie is excellent! it is really great to see a movie that dares to challenge religion like that, and still has a few points here and there.

Salma Hayek was cool, she was actually supposed to be a man, she was the muse that always had something smart to say when she or anyone else was in trouble. This movie was a black comedy that made heaven seem funny and made god seem like a regular woman.

480,revsonya,simply fabulous--kevin smith rocks!,9,15 May 2001,"While both funny and frightening, this film is more than just a comedy with gratuitous violence and (bad)-language.  It's a theological reflection...and a call to the Church to focus on things that matter (like living life to the fullest, helping those in need, honoring and respecting all, expecting respect in return) rather than those that don't (like...well, dogma [doctrines/church laws] or any belief that causes us to ""draw a line in the sand,"" condemning to hell or perdition any who disagree with us).  As I watched it (the first and all subsequent times), I felt sure that the movie was written by someone who really loves his church -- but is smart and aware enough to recognize its shortcomings, its blindspots, even its failures and hypocrisies.  Rather than simply leaving or ignoring or dismissing it, Smith chooses to enter into dialogue with it, using the potent medium of film to do so.  One can only hope that the church--not just Roman Catholic but all branches of it-- takes him up on his call to conversation.
Not to be missed in the film, on a lighter note, are the introductory disclaimer and the ""Thank Yous"" at the end.  Smith thanks Elaine Pagels, for God's sake -- who knew anyone in Hollywood read contemporary, feminist theology?  What a welcome revelation....",Dogma

I read the bit at the start though.Loads of people seem to be annoyed by the fact that it was too crude, which is probably my biggest problem with the film, but nothing's perfect(well God, but...).  Because it delt with theological issues, it made folk feel uncomfortable, either wanting a lot more or a lot less depth.  Cant satisfy everyone though.  I was impressed (as usual) with matt damon and ben affleck, and alan rickman was suited for the role.

483,KathleenMavourneen,It gets into your head and you can't get it out.,9,6 May 2002,"This is one of my favorite movies. Though the quality of the casting is generally high, there were some real gems. George Carlin as Cardinal Glick, Alanis Morisette as God, and especially Alan Rickman as Metatron were all brilliant. Jay and Silent Bob give what could be a potentially dangerous subject an edge of levity which might make some pseudo-Jays out there do a dangerous thing... They might learn to think. Linda Fiorentino plays her cynical, troubled character with grace and wit. And Damon and Affleck are eye candy with impressive vocabularies. Salma Hayek's Muse has some beautifully contemplative comments and advise. Alan Rickman is, as always, impressive. Then again, any man who will drop his pants on film and be subjected to having prosthetics applied has to have balls... if you pardon the expression. Anywho, Rickman has the best lines in the whole movie, which he delivers in that alternately caustic and compassionate tones of voice in which he seems to excel.The only major player in this movie who has fewer lines than Bob, is Alanis Morisette, who plays a very taciturn deity. This movie can be both cheesy and beautiful (the walking on water scene was simple, yet breathtaking), thought provoking and side-splittingly hilarious. I recommend it.",Dogma
484,Quiz_Kid_Donny_Smith,Great movie,9,7 August 2002,"***Spoilers!!!***I must confess I am a Kevin Smith-fan, so if you don't like his previous work you might not like this.This movie is all about religion, and although the Christian community (well, the die hards that is) weren't to happy with the release of this movie I think they should take it as a reality check for their religion. This movie points out the flaws of the Christian community but is never truly meant to be insulting (at least in my opinion), because I don't think Kevin Smith despises church. He just thinks there is room for improvement.The acting in the movie is great. Although I'm not the greatest fans of Matt Damon (Loki) and Ben Affleck (Bartleby)(although they do have their moments) they fit perfectly into this movie as two angels who want to get back into heaven. Linda Fiorentino is great as Bethany, the last descendant of Christ who has to stop Loki and Bartleby from going back to heaven as this will end humanity. This assignment is given to her by a character who is brilliantly interpreted by Alan Rickman, Metatron, the voice of God. Salma Hayek plays a former muse, Serendipity, who now works in a strip club. Chris Rock plays the 13th apostel, Rufus. Jason Lee plays Azrael, a fallen angel who wants Loki and Bartleby back in heaven so humanity will end and God will be proven wrong. And then there's the prophets... Jay and Silent Bob, probably one of the funniest couples in movie history (at least in my own opinion), played by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith.The story line (a little bit of it is written above but it's too winding to completely put here) is brilliant. It's a satire of the Christian church, although there aren't very many ""normal"" jokes (in comparison to for example Dumb & Dumber etc.) in the movie there are a lot of funny stabs towards the church which will make you laugh. Jay and Silent Bob are always great for some laughs. Silent Bob as the (usually) quite counterpart of Jay, probably one of the most rude characters in movie history. Everything that comes out of his mouth is stupid an dirty. I love it!Overall i must say this movie is great. It's funny, entertaining and intelligent. If your looking for a lot of stupid laughs this might not be you movie but if you want comedy with a little bit (just a little bit) more class. I recommend you pick this up sometime.My Score: 9/10",Dogma
485,cheeks9,A theological debate without the intelligence,1,11 May 2009,"In my last review (which was over a year ago) I reviewed ""Fight Club"". Now I am reviewing Kevin Smith's ""Dogma"". Don't see the link? However tenuous it may seem, there is one. I will elaborate: Fight Club is one of the best films I have ever seen. It is equal parts savage, primal, scathingly clever, subtle, engaging, subversive, and dangerous, without stopping for breath for its entire running length. The relevance of this to ""Dogma"" is how inherently opposed it seems to be to be any of these things. It is a tiresome, flaccid affair, and the complete opposite of ""Fight Club"" in the two most important categories: I watched all of ""Fight Club"" (many times), and I would feel comfortable in calling ""Fight Club"" an actual film.Oh, was this movie torturous. I'll make a handy comparison for those who don't really want to hear technical nonsense about characterisation or plot development (at least nonsense in this case; there is none). You're in a lecture theatre, awaiting the arrival of renowned atheist Richard Dawkins. You're expecting 10 minutes of lecture time, followed by food and pool in the Student's Union (i.e. to get to the part of the film where it starts being all, you know, filmic). Instead, someone is subbing for him. It is George Carlin. Except, he's drunk and, somehow, forgotten to be either funny or clever. So you're sitting there for an hour and a half, waiting for this embittered old man to at least pause for breath (for characterisation to set in, or for the plot to become clear). Instead, you're watching the guy make the same point in different guises for the horrible duration of it. In ""Dogma"", you're watching various elements being cobbled together with no apparent sense of structure; Ben Affleck and Matt Damon appear to discuss religion (skipping actual dialogue), Alan Rickman materialises as an angel to talk about his two mischievous fellow angels (OMG PARADOX!) and Chris Rock appears to do...something. After an hour of being bashed over the head with this rubbish, I just stopped caring. Now, this is supposed to be a religious comedy, so an element of farce would be fine. One requirement, however, is that the situation falls apart in a funny way. This is a film that falls apart in a way that is tragic, not funny. Even when Kevin Smith remembers to give his actors a little to work with, ie real dialogue, it's....still not funny. In fact, I didn't laugh once during the hour in which I writhed in my seat, itching to put something else on. Thus it is a film that fails on absolutely every level. And, ho boy, that's only from the first hour. I've been told in the past that I have to watch the whole film before I can judge. Here's a tip to filmmakers (Butterfly Effect Guy, pay attention): if you want to wait until the last half an hour to make your film good, the audience must be aware that the film is going in the direction of being good; better this than ""Dogma"", which seems to perpetually circle the drain. Usually in the case of religiously orientated films, it is the job of the reviewer to interpret the film's religious implications. At least ""Dogma"" is kind in this respect: it makes no effort to be subtle about its standpoint. All Kevin Smith forgot to do was make a film to go along with it.",Dogma

The movie could not exist without it, in other words, the movie is a two hour Catholic joke. For some people, it is sacrilege. The movie is to be taken with a grain of salt.

487,newmill_loon,Genius,10,28 May 2003,"I remember this television interview a good few years ago involving the cast of monty python. While promoting their film 'The Life Of Brian', they appeared on this show, and also there was this elderly clergy man who did not like the way the story of the bible was being portrayed in the film. He absolutly ripped John Cleese and Micheal Pailin to bits, asking them if they were proud to be associated with pile of drivel.  Well thank Kevin Smith's lucky stars that the old man was not around while this film was being promoted, because the old man would have stoned Kevin Smith with his film. I think that the star/writer/director Kevin Smith has done a wonderful thing by making this film, as it gives the time old story of the bible a new modern twist and injecting some youth into a contrived story. There are so many laughs in this film that it would be impossibe to though them. All the stars seem to have a good time with the film and make the film very plesent to watch. Chris Rock is a riot to watch in the film, and his reply to jay's question about if he has ever met jesus christ~  ""Met him, sh*t, nigger owes me twelve dollars"" is worth the rental fee itself.

488,baddream13,Kevin Smith is a genius.,10,27 January 2003,"Kevin Smith is a genius.  I love all of his films simply because his dialogue flows so eloquently.  His characters all talk like we wish we could talk all the time.  Witty banter bounces back and forth between characters in his films like tennis balls at a match.  But this movie had something different, something extra.  It is so so dangerous to make a comedy where religion is the focus of humor.  But Smith made not one thing offensive. He tread carefully, and I'm sure bible-thumpers were infuriated to find nothing more offensive than Mooby the Golden Calf, which offended the characters in the film, therefore cancelling itself out and rendering that complaint moot. Having been raised a catholic, I completely agreed with everything this movie pointed out about the idiosynchrasies of religion.  I actually felt like this movie enlightened me.  At a time when I on the brink of atheism, this movie helped point out that it's not God I don't believe in, it's the institute of Catholicism, and it's endless rules and doctrines and hypocrisies.  Anyway, a little off the subject there. I will again reiterate, this movie is pure genius.  Excellent acting by Matt Damon (his scene with the nun and the Alice in Wonderland analogy was perfectly executed).  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck both know exactly how to deliver Smith's dialogue.  Selma Hayek was superb as the uber-intellectual ex-muse.  And Chris Rock as Rufus the forgotten apostle was priceless.

On one level, I can watch it purely for the verbal humour, which is sharp and well placed.On another, it has a kind of thoughtful cynicism and which redresses issues of concern that surround the Catholic faith (and others) in the modern day. It vents it spleen, showing the dissatisfaction that many people have with institutionalised belief systems.Granted, the humour may be offensive to many, as the dialogue is course and many Catholic/Christian beliefs & views are ridiculed, but the timeliness of this piece as a comment on how our cynical our generation has become and, furthermore, how belief can be newfound, if only it is not based on the rigid strictures of organised religion, is wonderful.Those saying that the film is juvenile and puerile must have only concentrated on watching one character throughout the film - Jay.

494,jdlund,Extraordinarily overrated,1,18 April 2004,"Overrated would be my review for most of Kevin Smith films.  I am still not sure how on Earth he has such a cult following.  The only film of his that was good, was Chasing Amy and even that had its flaws.  He also has the pleasure of directing a film that is on my top five worst films list which is Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.  Be that as it may my problems with Dogma are a little different than most of his films.  The first time I saw it I kinda liked it.  The second time I realized how bad it was.  First of all choosing to satarize the catholic church, especially in film form, is like writing a love poem.  It's been done so many times you had better do something new or different, Smith does neither of these.  I think of the films of Buneul, Felini, certainly the Monty Python stuff, certain Woody Allen films and so forth and that's what I think of as good satire of the church.  There are countless others that did the subject so much better than here.  The biggest problem that I had with Dogma is that the film had no idea what it wanted to be.  It kept switching from semi-serious film to farce.  Normally I don't have a problem with genre bending, but here it shouldn't be done.  If this film was a farce than all the serious elements are out of place and pointless.  If this film is suppose to be more serious, say just a normal variety of comedy(for an example ""As Good as it Gets""), all the farcicle elements become really asinine.  Take the reasoning for why the universe is going to be wiped out of existence.  If this is not a farce(and I mean Marx Brothers, Monty Python brand of farce) then that idea is so ridiculous it doesn't deserve to be thought of.  First of all if we are focussing on the catholic church, perhaps we should consider what they actuall believe.  According to the bible(not a bible nut, just happen to know this) angels can't be redeemed.  Period.  No confession, no archway, they are angels and not humans.  According to this films premise, if Lucifer walked through the archway he would be able to go back to heaven.  Of course he'd have to cut his horns off, I would imagine going with Smiths wing thing.  In this case, why didn't Azreal do it?  He was also an angel cast down, why couldn't he walk through the arches and undo all of creation? They are not human beings and therefore not subject to the same rules. End of discussion.  Too much of this film is trying to make a ""serious"" commment on religious dogma, and it tries to do so by ignoring what the catholic church and the bible actually says.  Couldn't Smith come up with something not totally idiotic to hinge the film on?  Since this is the base of the films story I must say that this film is completely pointless.  Outside of that the Jay and Silent Bob stuff here is really annoying and their pressence is pointless and forced.  Then of course there was the scene where Kevin Smith showed how bad of a writer he is when he gets out of the S*** Demon sequence by using odor spray.  This is moronic and worthy of a Junior High school laugh.  Even S*** Demon repelant(ala Batman style) would have been funier.  The truth is, Smith knew of no better way to get out of the scene and he is a very sloppy writer.  He isn't much better as a director as there is absolutely nothing visually interesting about this film, and that is the directors MAIN job.  We are after all talking about a visual medium. In the end, seriously don't waste your time with this, it is horrible.",Dogma

Though at times, some people might be confused by the little mini-plots, there was nothing that was not explained or didn't seem to fit. I do believe Kevin Smith could have left out the sh*t demon. It was a bit corny and that valuable time in this long movie could have been replaced by some of the cut scenes of two of the movie's best actors, George Carlin and Jason Lee (Kevin Smith had to cut most of their scenes to shorten the movie). People also complain about the f word being used a bit much but it is mainly used by Jay and helps portray him as a rash young man that he is. What would the movie be like with a clean mouthed Jay?

I just can't believe great actors like Matt Damon, Salma Hayek and Alan Rickman actually read the script to this drivel and then said 'yes, I'll do it', nor that the high average rating this film has received from IMDb users is 7.3. In my opinion it's one of the most stupid films I've ever seen. OK, I know it's a comedy, or at least that it's billed as a comedy. And I do admit there are one or two funny moments in it. But these were completely swamped by an inane plot, some very poor acting by Linda Florentino, a dreadfully tedious and repetitive gag line from Jay and his silent mate (Gosh I wonder what he's going to say next? Some crude comment about wanting a shag? Yes, 100% correct - again) and tonnes of cringy creepy religious clap trap 'it's not what your beliefs but your ideas that count'. The film was just total rubbish.

I'm a firm believer that one has to laugh at oneself throughout life in order to keep one's feet firmly on the ground.The reason I wasn't offended was because this movie's script/dialogue/everything was so unbelievably bad that the only emotion it conjured up out of me was a new level of boredom. I don't know who told Kevin Smith he was funny, but whoever that person is needs a roundhouse kick to the face.Almost every one of Smith's punchlines is a swear word. That's funny if it's limited (I have no problem with swearing in comedies; Midnight Run and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang are two of my favorite movies). I could have tolerated it if the movie actually had some amusing humor in it, but,alas, there was none.The only part that made me snicker slightly was a joke ripped off from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The only part where I laughed was when the main character sprayed Alan Rickman with a fire extinguisher.Of course the kicker came at the end where Smith tries to play the ""serious"" card and lay out some ""honest"" criticism of Catholicism. Generally speaking, I don't like this method of criticism (whatever the subject) because it prevents the audience from critically analyzing it. Before you can fully process what's been said, Smith moves to another topic. Granted, one could do some research after the movie to determine the validity of Smith's claims, but please don't try and tell me everyone did that.If a real humorist had tackled this subject, perhaps something could have been made of it.",Dogma
502,Moondog,good for your faith,9,21 December 1999,"This movie was great.  It had one of the best ensemble casts for a movie that I've ever seen.  It was a great story- very entertaining.  And, in its apparent total irreverence it completely cuts through the crap that mankind has stacked up to make religions serve men instead of God.  I suppose it is all just the opinion of Kevin Smith (Silent Bob, as I understand).  But, I think it is very true. An unconditionally loving and forgiving god is an ""idea"" (you'll know what that's about if you see the movie) that will serve humanity much better than any law or rules or DOGMA than any human-founded religion may present. CHASING AMY was a very good movie, his other two slacker flicks are entertaining and original, but congrats to Smith for making a truly meaningful film with DOGMA. Instantly one of my top 3 favorite movies I'd say.",Dogma
503,DocJ,Disappointing,4,13 November 1999,"Being a fan of Kevin Smith, I jumped at the opportunity to go check his new film ""Dogma"".  What a waste of five bucks. The film had its funny moments, such as the disclaimer at the beginning, the ""Buddy Jesus"", and Jay. With Chris Rock and George Carlin, two very talented comedians, you would think that it would be funny.  Chris Rock's punch lines were so incoherent; I had to ask every time he said something.  The movie got old after a half hour. It was the same old drivel over and over, like beating a dead horse. Maybe I should have gone to The Insider instead.",Dogma
504,Adrian-16,Of Biblical Proportions!!,10,11 November 1999,"I just saw the sneak preview of Dogma and suffice to say it is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Imagine Clerks mixed with the Wizard of Oz, with a hearty helping of The Ten Commandments and a dash of Oh God!. Throw in some Marx Brothers (Jay and Silent Bob were gold!) and some Butch and Sundance, and you have Dogma. It rolled along nicely and is well filmed! (although for some reason, the dubbing was a little off in some scenes!) The flick was funny and probably does more good for Catholicism than not. Hail the platypus!",Dogma
505,kevhead,A must-see for all Catholics,9,24 March 2000,"A wildly imaginative movie that all Catholics should see.  Written by a Catholic (Kevin Smith), Mr. Smith deals with his own doubts about the religion most likely forced upon him in his childhood.  While rabid Catholics dismiss it as blasphemous without even viewing the film, it presents problems with Catholicism in a way that would make Martin Luther proud.  It dares to questions while so many man-made Catholic laws and rules have applied for centuries without any member stop to question their basis or validity.  Despite the underlying moral premise, this movie is fun and interesting filled with mythical characters that seem much more human than their angelic standing would suggest.  Alanis Morrisette plays ""God"" for goodness sake!",Dogma

I have grown up in a catholic environment and after seeing this movie I was so moved I went to church on Sunday, this being the first time in a long time for me.

Ignore them, this movie is SOLID!  It's a terrific story, and an excellent cast really made it fly (no pun intended).  I found the digs at the Catholic church (and ultimately organized religion in general) to be thought provoking and entertaining, but some of the more in-depth dialogue about faith and beliefs was really excellent. Jay and Silent Bob are better than ever, though I found Jay's excessive use of ""f**k"" to be a little much by the film's end. Still, a great film on the whole!",Dogma
508,Seeds,Just Wasn't Funny,3,23 May 2000,"I wasn't offended by this movie religiously, I was offended that this was an attempt to make me laugh.  The dialogue was terrible, how hard is it to write ""insert swear here"".  The running jokes of God is a woman, God is black grew tiresome after the third or fourth mention.  Sometimes I felt like I was watching a Police Academy movie, just with a tons of violence and profanity.Why did Kevin Smith insist on trying to use shock value in a lot of the scenes?  The scene on the bus, the scene in the boardroom, ooh, blood splattering on objects, haven't seen that one before.I could expect Ben Affleck and Chris Rock in something like this, but what a waste of Alan Rickman and Linda Fiorentino's talent.  Alannis Morissette was the only bright part of the movie, maybe because she doesn't have any dialogue.",Dogma
509,Diomed,MIRAMAX-You are sitting on a goldmine!!!!!!!!!,9,31 July 1999,"From reading about how Miramax is scared about releasing this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect.  But when I got a chance to see the LA screening, I jumped at the chance.  I was hoping the movie wouldn't simply be a ""make fun of the establishment"" type of flick.  Although it was a little touch and go in the beginning, once this movie gets going (when Alan Rikman shows up) it really takes off. This movie is actually a pro-God movie, and it actually confirms the Christian faith.  To be offended by this film is to be offended by life. What Kevin Smith creates is one of the smartest comedies ever written.  This movie flows so well despite some wooden acting and the usual wooden directing.  But that is what is great about Kevin Smith, his ability to write GREAT dialogue totally carries the movie.  Affleck, Damon, Rikman, and Rock are fantastic, and Jay totally steals the show. If you aren't religious, you'll greatly enjoy this movie, and if you ever went to either Sunday school or Catholic school, you'll love it. I really hope this movie gets released soon-besides being the only film I've truly recommended to my friends since October Sky, I want to see it again.",Dogma

It's rare that a filmmaker can hit it out of the park all four times he is up to bat(I'm sorry, I liked Mallrats).Kevin Smith has truely out done himself this time. I thought  that the film would not live up to the hype it created, but it did. Smith has even refined his writing style. While there were plenty of tangents, diatribes and pop culture references, they all served a single purpose, telling the story.
Only one question remains: Can he out do this film with the ones that follow?",Dogma
512,Trent-29,"Not subtle, but definitely fun",8,15 November 1999,"While Kevin Smith's fourth film, Dogma, hits readers over the head with its blunt message and even more blunt language, the end result is a fun, funny and memorable film. Smith's directing skills are improving steadily and he manages great performances out of the occasionally uneven Chris Rock and Salma Hayek. In all, a worthy satire of organized religion that ironically gets its message across by preaching to the audience via Smith's trademark monologues",Dogma

Many young, ignorant, Gen Xers will flock like the sheep that they are to this movie. Because of the ""cool"" factor.  The ""Let's push the envelope"" factor.  Too bad Kevin Smith has to try so hard - and it's too bad it shows. I applaud pushing the limits, but writing to intentionally cause controversy is another story. This is a twisted, demoralizing and demeaning movie. I'm not a prude, and I'm quite open minded; however, viciously attacking any religion is spiteful and hateful. It's *not* funny.

It was like a Jr. High book report on the Bible & Catholicism by some precocious teen who is more anxious to impress the chicks with trivial irreverence than thoughtful incite.

516,Matt-371,A Religious Comedy,10,19 November 1999,"I am a huge Kevin Smith fan and after seeing this film I can say that it was everything I hoped it would be, and a little bit more. It's extremely well written and directed. The film has the same great comedy we're used to from Kevin Smith, but he shows that he has another dimension that I don't think many people thought was there.Jay and Silent Bob have their biggest role so far. Jay has some of his laugh out loud funniest one liners yet. But what really makes this a great film is that it is genuinely thought provoking.There are religious people out there who will criticize this film as being anti religion, anti Catholicism, when it is anything but (well, a little anti Cathlic maybe). The central theme to the film is that there is a God, but not the God that most people know (or think they know) or believe in. The characters in the film are trying to get the message across that people have changed the original God, man has made God into the image they want him/her to be, made their own religious rules, rules that God never intended. From a strictly biblical standpoint, Smith is right on, which is not something that can be said about many films dealing with religion. And isn't that the entire point to Christianity, that it's based on the bible.",Dogma
517,slsmith2,Amazing movie that will make you think,10,5 December 1999,"I didn't really know what this movie was about when I went to see it last night, but I went because people who had seen it told me it was really good. They weren't lying.  This movie is amazing!  It really made me think a lot about religion, beliefs, church, the Bible, and God.  But if you're not a religious person, don't let that stop you from seeing this movie.  One of my friends who I saw this with is agnostic, and she loved it.  I think it would appeal to anyone, no matter what your thoughts on religion, as long as you have a sense of humor and can respect that this is a film and is only fiction.Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are fantastic as a pair of renegade angels.  The array of actors in this cast playing some pretty unlikely parts, such as George Carlin as a Cardinal and Chris Rock as the apostle Rufus, not to mention Selma Hayek and Alanis Morisette, make the movie.  Kevin Smith casts himself as Silent Bob, a greatly expressive character even though he only says three words.  Smith creates a legendary film that will undoubtedly be talked about for years to come.",Dogma
518,badhatharry,Quite the surprise...,10,13 November 1999,"This movie was exactly the opposite of what i had expected.  I went in with all the controversy in my head, expecting something completely blasphemous. What I found was a good natured, good humored comedy about religion - something I had never seen before.  It's ideas about religion and faith and what people choose to believe in was almost right on target.  Granted Jay said some of the most irreverent things I have ever heard, but that's the way his character is, and I expected nothing less from Mr. Smith.The acting was also top rate.  The timing between Mr. Damon and Mr. Affleck was impecable.  As well, Ms. Fiorentino continued her string of strong female characters.Kevin Smith has outdone himself.  He's gone a new way from Chasing Amy and succeeded beautifully.

I can't say I was amazed or that I laughed 'till I hurt, 'cause I wasn't and I didn't.  It was moderately funny.  It was moderately insightful.  It was a bit preachy, rude in a boring, repetitive way (the can-we-get-her-into-bed humour started off with a chuckle, but got real old real fast), and kinda had some problems with pacing.  I knew I was going to get a nap in when they started to explain what the Metatron is, 'cause I _know_ what the Metatron is.  Allowing for the necessity of enlightening those that don't, I count my comment in to be predjudiced, and I expect that only those that have something more than a superficial knowledge of Catholic _mythology_ will be strongly agreeing with me here.  This also follows for most of the instances where the story stopped to explain some theological point to our two favorite stoners, Jay and Bob. (I like Silent Bob.  He had some of the best lines in the movie.) There were good bouts of humour, I'll grant you, and on the whole it was an interesting wander into, well, Dogma and had a full parcel of disrespectful jabs at the Catholic Church (which needs an occasional jab).  On the whole I'd say watch it, definitely, but not in the theatres for the prices they gouge- err, charge, and not if you're devoutly Catholic and in need of a good jab.",Dogma

I've seen the Jersey Trilogy (Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy) many times, and loved them each and every time - this movie will be no exception.  I love the typical Kevin Smith banter, the references to other movies (including his own!) - this is definitely Smith's best yet!As for the controversy, the Catholics who say this movie undermines faith have got to be some of the most closed-minded individuals ever, especially those who haven't even seen it!  The movie may undermine TRADITION, but definitely not faith itself - if anything, the movie helps one to strengthen faith by putting a much-needed humorous and enlightening spin on something that has become too serious and dreary for its own good.  I'm especially amused by some Christians who call this movie ""evil"" - there's nothing evil in this movie, just a fun that's a little too close to the truth for comfort.",Dogma

This was the most boring, unfunny and pointless movie I have seen in a long time. First off...the Jay and Silent Bob act has reached it's limit. Jay is an idiot and he's lost that drug-dealer's charm which he posessed in the first movie and the inevitable one liner from Silent Bob thing is just plain stupid.

On a more objective note, ""Dogma"" is probably the BEST movie I've seen this year.  As other ""professional"" and amateur reviews have stated, it'll probably offend some Catholics and others.  Some who haven't seen it will avoid it because of what they've heard about it, and some who see it will miss the point and think it is sacrilegious, but to me it is ultimately just the opposite, though it does present an alternate view of faith which may be sorta unsettling to some people.All the acting is excellent, and it kept my interest through the entire film.  About the only negative thing when I saw it wasn't the fault of the movie.  There were a few people, especially a semi-obnoxious woman sitting near me, who laughed at stuff more ""heartily"" than the scenes called for.

From the very first minutes the clear impression given to the audience is that there is no reverence shown to either the church or to its beliefs.  If you bothered to watch the movie, unlike the morons sitting outside the theater protesting its showing, you could clearly see that the writer Kevin Smith has a Christian background. The movie shows Christian principles throughout,  from the very beginning there were almost subliminal signs and by the ending it is clear as day. Not many films can convey a sign of morality aside from Good vs. Evil, and films that do really stick out.  Only one other film has impressed me as much as Dogma on a morality level and that was ""The Shawshank Redemption"". Dogma is a great hilarious film with a surprising spike of decency and Christian morality,  out of 10 I'd give Dogma a solid 9",Dogma

Who will ever forget Alanis Morissette's memorable portrayal of God? Or, Chris Rock and Salma Hayek finding their moments of movie Zen.

If you're a Jay and Silent Bob fan, you'll love this movie, because they are in almost every scene. Of course, this fact can work the opposite way as well. Matt Damon came off a bit flat as the fallen angel Loki, but if there's one thing Kevin Smith movies do (besides Mallrats), it's that they make you think.

By that I mean that people seem to love this movie or loath it. By no means do I loath this movie, but It wouldn't make it onto my 'best ever list'One of the reasons I like it is because it does actually raise some excellent points. For example, Jesus WASN'T white. This is a fact (I mean come on, he is jewish born in Jerusulam, we made him western). He wasn't black either but the point the Rufus made is correct, it seems only a white person can be the worlds saviour.Another thing that I found interesting was the fact that Joseph and Mary had more children and that there are direct descendants of them.
Now for the movie on it's own merit. The script, as ever, very talkative, quick and witty, more f***s than is necessary and I found myself actually switching off from what was being said due to the boredom of hearing it 1001 times.  That said, the script is excellent.the direction, never Smiths strongpoint, actually I heard him say on a TV show that he asked Robert Rodriguez to direct the day before they started shooting because he couldn't handle it, is not good, the second half does get boring but not so boring you want to switch off. It should have been quicker and tighter.The cast is briiliant!!  I like Damon and Affleck (especially Affleck, ruled in Chasing amy) Lee is just genius and Rickman is pure class (I'm English, call me biased :P) The female stars aren't the best, Fiorintino is OK, Hayek, obviously smart, Very beautiful but Cannot handle Smiths fast talking dialogue. Maybe if the movie was in Spanish....In short, watch this movie with an open mind, religion is irrelevant, it's not meant to be blasphemous or anything like that, just a look at religion.

This movie are the second worst movie I ever saw and it lasted 2 hours! 2 LONG LONG hours. Some other reviewers said that this movie is full of messages, so don't think that I didn't like it because it was more than laughs. I love movies with humor and I love movies that make you think (like Harold and Kumar) but this movie failed miserably in both fronts. Humor: I kind of smile at 2 scenes in the whole movie. Deeper meanings: there are not 'deeper' if they are shoved in your face for 2 hoursFinal advice: If you already have the DVD in front of you, and I still haven't convince you, watch the first 10-15 minutes and when you see my point put the DVD out and do something else with your time.

It's great to see Kevin Smith take on a serious topic while keeping his sense of humor, which is, as always, all over the place: smart jokes, silly jokes, sex jokes, one-liners, black comedy, even toilet humor.The title is perfect and even a little joke in and of itself. The movie centers around Christianity (Catholicism specifically) and how dogmatic practices and beliefs--in a world where, at least, the bible got some things right--come to threaten all existence. My grandfather, who was a well-esteemed minister in the Congregational Church for 40+ years, loved it, and agnostic kids like myself enjoy the hell out of it too. Someone told me it was Smith's take on Paradise Lost. You have to give props to a guy who can make a takeoff on a 17th century epic poem this fun.",Dogma
539,findastyle,Kevin Smith does it again!,10,22 January 2003,"Well, I have to say this movie is... special! ;) Sure, a lot of people had problems with it and will have, but you have to admit the idea was amazing and original. This is not your average angel and god movie, this is a funny and satirical comedy, which wasn't brought to the viewers to mock their belief, but to show them that god does have a sense of humour - read the titles just before the movie! So Kevin Smith does a great job again and kind of a reunion for Jason Lee, Ben Affleck, Jason Mewes and of course Kevin Smith since Mallrats. :) Not to mention, I never thought of Alanis Morisette as God! Amazing movie, definitely worth watching even a few times in a row.",Dogma

Fer Pete's sake, anyone here has already seen the film, therefore recaps are redundant.I got to this film looking for more Damon/Afleck stuff because I watched GWH, again, on a flight to Copenhagen. After six months I've found this movie and have explored the whole Kevin Smith thing.Masterpiece. Then Clerks and Amy, etc. and I'm on to Smith, who's inspiration/business- model can be summarized in two words; Lucas & Bruce. Lucas created a cinematic universe and Springsteen created a fan-base. Good work. Excellent.My hat is off to Smith, who did it all with just his local buds, a bit of sympathetic outside talent, and chutzpah. Plus, Jason Mewes makes it all worthwhile. Don't buy it? Watch his little ""Amy"" bit again.

542,BigBoss34,What really gets to me is the religious critics,9,5 July 2005,"I think if you read the comments on this movie, you will get the gist that there are two opinions, either that it is a fantastic, hilarious and innovative film, or that it is a disgrace to roman catholics, a farce or a demeaning film with ill thought humour.I haven't got much to say about the plot and characters since they are covered if you read any of the other user comments (which summarily both are fantastic). But i would like to emphasise that the authors of the latter opinion outlined above are narrow minded vindictive movie viewers, in fact not even movie viewers but sad people who are boxed of in their little religious worlds and cant appreciate a bit of humour.I am Sikh, fairly religious, and have broad shoulders in that i can take a bit banter about my religion. In my opinion religion without any solid evidential footing (i.e. god coming down from the skies and laying down the rules to humans face to face) can only ever be speculation or as many like to say A BELIEF! But what is a belief? Simply an opinion! I will never discourage people having belief, but i will question accepted wisdom. And i think that thats all Kevin Smith has done in Dogma. He has an opinion which he has expressed in a film, and he's no idiot, he knows his stuff. He has researched a few religions and has intelligently questioned many orthodoxy's. I love this movie because of this and despite the f*****g's and the b*****d's, there is an eye opening angle to religion which he delightfully delivers with help from Hollywood's finest.This is a great film. Please if you have not watched it, do so right now! your missing out. And be open minded and try to understand the message the film is sending! And for those self reichess people who are offended by this movie just remember, your not sitting on the top of the world and other people are allowed an opinion! The Platypus is a great creature!

People should have protested the fact that it was moronic, not it's religious angle. Go watch paint dry, anything but this!! Unless you are into long religious monologues interrupted by crude, unfunny jokes, then don't see this piece of embarrassing crap. I think that Ben Affleck and Kevin Smith should take this movie, along with ""Jersey Girl"", and throw it in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. This movie is not worth all the hype it received back in 1999. Kevin Smith and his army of moronic stoners are the only ones who could possibly find this funny.

546,joemac,"A Good Film, But Flawed in Some Ways",6,13 November 1999,"Let me begin by saying that I am an enormous fan of Kevin Smith and his previous three films.  ""Clerks"" and ""Chasing Amy"" are two of the best films of the nineties, and ""Mallrats"" is easily one of the funniest. But with his newest effort, Smith has created a flawed film that while it was enjoyable on one level, it lacked severely in others.""Dogma"" is one of the most intelligent screenplays ever written, and easily the best ever written dealing with the Catholic Faith (with apologies to Paul Schrader).  An Oscar nomination is due to Smith for this work, and that, I believe, cannot be disputed. The film is well-structured, witty, but most importantly is was obviously written with a love and respect for his faith.  But as for Smith's ability as a director, I believe that is a different subject altogether.  Even if the dialogue is extraordinarily well-written, most viewers cannot sit through a film where they sit through over-the-shoulder shots again and again while two characters debate their faith.  It, quite frankly, gets a little boring.True, some blame is due to the actors, who may be in over their heads delivering this weighty dialogue.  In some scenes between both Linda Fiorentino and Alan Rickman, and Fiorentino and Chris Rock, Fiorentino seems to bring the scene down.  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck showed their incredibly chemistry on screen, and Affleck is especially fun to watch as the angel who is so in touch with God's relationship with humans that he becomes jealous of that relationship.  He is the brightest star in an amazing cast, and Smith himself ranks a close second.  His facial expressions are tremendous, and his few lines are delivered with an honesty and conviction that is rare for any actor.  Jason Lee is another stand out as Azrael, the one true villain in the story.  Whenever these three actors were involved in a scene, the movie was intensely enjoyable.
I did enjoy the movie however, and laughed very hard some scenes,  although not as often as in Smith's previous films.  Smith himself once said that his style was to have no style.  A film like this needs some amount of style to it, and it needed it bad.",Dogma
547,serendipidy,A movie that takes a risk,10,14 September 2000,"Dogma is a movie that I highly enjoyed. It is not like every other film that is out there. Kevin Smith is not afraid to push the envelope and I sure he made enemies with this film. That is one of the reasons that I liked it. It took a stance against something that people sometime take too serious.
Alan Rickman is fantastic and even Alanis impressed me.
I recommend that you see it even if you don't agree with the plot line. Everybody's got to hate something.",Dogma

I was raised Catholic and have lived in Wisconsin my whole life.  I thought it was hilarious that Wisconsin would be considered hell on earth.  Today I agree, as I wait for my car to be fixed due to the very cold temperatures.  I only had one problem with the acting in this movie.  Somebody obviously didn't do their research.  Us people in Wisconsin say Wisconsin a certain way.  For future reference, the stress is on WIS, not CON.All in all, I really liked the movie.  Ben and Matt did a superb job.",Dogma

I was among about a dozen viewers at a Saturday matinee, and even a few less viewers who stayed around for the conclusion of this senseless diatribe, and it's convoluted plot.

550,BruddahChrispy,Kevin Smith's best work to date,9,23 May 2000,"Kevin Smith continues to mature as a director and writer.  His latest effort, Dogma, is a masterpiece of both casting and dialog.  Although some may take offense at the subject matter I found it very pro-God, which is not to say it is pro-religion.  It skewers the inconsistencies in Catholic dogma with needle-sharp precision.Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Linda Fiorentino are excellent in the starring roles.  Alan Rickman's entrance is one of the highlights of the movie. Chris Rock, Selma Hayek, and Jason Lee provide solid performances. Although George Carlin is excellent in his role, I found his interpretation of the character to be a little too much George Carlin and not enough Cardinal Glick. Fans of Jay and Silent Bob will love their expanded screen time.",Dogma
551,felman,Great Movie,10,14 November 1999,I've been a huge fan of Kevin Smith ever since I first saw Clerks and this would have to be my second favorite Kevin Smith movie I have seen. The movie has a little bit of a edge to it but still very funny and the parts in the movie with jay and bob were the greatest if your a fan of Kevin Smiths work. I was surprised about the amount of blood and violence but all in all a great film I give it a 10 a must see if you like Kevin Smiths work.,Dogma
552,Geoff-57,"Fun, but grossly over-rated",5,21 November 1999,"Let me start by saying that I think Kevin Smith is perhaps the single most over-rated director of my generation, so anyone drooling for another review from a Smith-adoring sycophant should stop reading now.  I got so annoyed with ""Clerks"" that I walked out before the end, and when I did stay for the end of ""Chasing Amy"" I wished I hadn't, it was so beyond contrived.  ""Dogma"" was the first of Smith's films that I actually liked, but some of the worshipful reviews I've read of it are just plain disturbing.Smith likes to try to shock us, usually with what another comment on this site referred to as ""dick and fart jokes"".  The effective moments of ""Dogma"" saw the characters thinking within the logic of Catholicism as presented by the movie and producing problems and jokes from within that space (for example, Jay's response after Rufus has painstakingly elaborated Fiorentino's divine heritage: ""So, she's black?""  That was a perfect one that registered the biggest laugh of the night with the audience I was in). The far more prevalent moments were simple applications of the tired ""dick and fart jokes"" to new targets, be it the Church, organized religion in general, etc.  When the film first does this, it rightly offsets the seriousness and grandeur of the religious, but when the film does this for TWO HOURS STRAIGHT, I get a little bored, a little annoyed that Smith doesn't seem to know when he's made his point.  So he just keeps on making it, and keeps on making it.  And I quit finding it funny.Fiorentino was woefully misused, cracking sarcasms when she should be full of curiosity, fear and trembling, rendering her otherwise beautiful moment of self-doubt utterly unbelievable and unmotivated (and almost, well, hokey), but the Wonder Bread Boys Damon and Affleck are actually really good, as is Rickman.One final word to those who see in ""Dogma"" a critique of organized religion: Let's not forget that this supposed critique is a film whose very premise (articulated by Loki and Bartleby themselves, at the movie's outset in the airport) is that the Catholic Church speaks for God.  Can you critique as outmoded and fallen an institution whose very status as divine authority is required by the plot structure of your critique?  I don't think it works.Let's see ""Dogma"" for what it is, a pretty good comedy.  But let's not fall into the sandtrap of calling a movie deep just because it talks its way around religion.  Other films have engaged religion far more credibly, and those are the asses we should be kissing.",Dogma
553,shipbrk,Far more cerebral than I had expected. This is a good thing!,10,16 November 1999,"I enjoyed Dogma quite a bit, so much so that I went back the next night (with different people) to see it again.One of the things that amused me greatly was the constant barrage of almost subliminal religious in-jokes (such as the poster of ""Enoch the Aardvark""; according to some legends, Enoch was a perfect mortal, whom God transformed into the Metatron).Other things, which appeared on the surface to be mere throwaway jokes intended to shock and offend, I found to be rather tongue-in-cheek commentaries on the state of religion.  For example, the ""Buddy Christ"", which apparently offended some people sitting behind me, seemed to me not very far out of keeping with the Catholic Church's [relatively] recent history of trying to make its services more palatable to the masses (no pun intended), such as changing the language of the Mass from Latin or shifting liturgical music away from that which was written to be beautiful (and often technically demanding) towards songs which, though rather mediocre when compared to their predecessors, could be sung by everyone in the congregation.And while some reviewers found the dialogues boring, I found them a welcome change from the usual Hollywood expectation that we viewers simply want to shut our minds off and watch nonstop action.  It was, ultimately, a movie about ideas, and while this won't appeal to everyone, it certainly appealed to me.Like the Bible, different people will interpret Dogma in different ways. Some will be offended by it, others will find it delightful.  Some will be bored by the dialogues, and some will enjoy the characters' examinations of themselves and the world around them... and perhaps do some thinking of their own.My only real complaint was that it was difficult to understand heavenly/hellish voices, such as the Metatron (when embodied as a column of fire) or Noman.",Dogma
554,fu-q,What is all the protesting about?,10,13 November 1999,"Dogma is the fourth movie in Kevin Smith""s movie making career. And as opposed to the other three, Dogma has stirred up some contraversy. His other movies (Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Clerks) where low budget (With the exception of Mallrats) cult masterpeices that had nothing to do with Catholicism  or any other religion, but his movies where so good that it stirred up its own cult. Dogma was a well awaited for fourth in the series, and I guess you could say that Kevin Smith pushed his luck.On a personal level, as a firm believer in my lord and savior Jesus Christ, and as a big fan of Kevin Smith, I have to say this movie was outstanding! It did not deal with blasphemy, and it did not in the least bit down God. All the rumors about the movie are false. Now I admit that the language is a bit rough, but the movie praises God.  The quarrel with the Church is typical of the Lutheran beginnings - nothing new; buying plenary indulgances or walking through a door to absolve sins is similar.  As long as man has pride and makes decisions in absence of God's will, as we know has happened in the Church, this will be a problem for those of us who want to remain in the Church, but focus on our relationship with God.  This is the crux of Mr. Smith's writing; nothing really new here, but the language is relentless, for those non-swearers so you could have a beef about that. As for all the protesters, go and see the movie, and see for yourself. Stop throwing stones at something you don't know.  And I do not appreciate all the bad rap Dogma is getting.",Dogma
555,Plex Shaw,Hopeless,2,27 December 1999,"Kevin Smith has finally lost the plot. The director of the fantastic Clerks', the woeful Mallrats' and the wonderful Chasing Amy' proves in Dogma' that he is not nearly as talented as his debut feature would suggest. Two fallen angels, Loki and Bartleby, are trying get back into heaven via a cathedral in Red Bank, New Jersey. But this is only if Bethany, with the aid of Jay and Silent Bob, cannot stop them first.The best thing that can be said about Dogma' is that it looks like everyone had a great time making it. However, it is rarely fun to watch. After the initially amusing first twenty minutes, the lofty subject matter soon takes over, yet Smith fails to change the film's tone accordingly. Jay's constant sexual banter and the knowing film references soon become tiresome, whilst the actors are either bored or confused by the events that surround them. Smith, who is not a visual director, seems uneasy shooting anything other then long monologues, and as a result the new special effects and scope framing that he has to play with go to waste. The larger budget looks as though it has been spent on casting rather then good ideas and the up-shot of this is that an encounter with a s**t monster' and the wacky' boardroom massacre become two examples of many dismal attempts at comedy. The fight at the end, for example, is crying for some action, yet Smith breaks all the tension by resorting to yet more crude, irritating dialogue. The insinuation the Jesus was black and that God is a woman hardly seem original concepts these days yet Smith treats them as though they are ground breaking. The questioning of religious faith seems to be what this film is all about, but you're more likely to question why spent money watching the film in the first place. Hopeless.",Dogma

A 8.5 on a scale of 1-10.",Dogma
559,Doc-189,Glib monologues are no substitute for dialogue,3,11 January 2000,"Kevin Smith has talent, but Dogma does not reflect it.  The film, while trying to be interesting, falls flat for several reasons: The characters, the script, the editing, the plot, and the theological inconsistencies. Aside from these problems, the film has some merit.The range of characters has not grown since Clerks.  While Jay and Silent Bob are funny, they soon become a standing joke that grows tiresome. Does every film require them?  I appreciate how Hitchcock always put himself in one scene in his movies, but Kevin Smith is beating this concept to death.  The other characters are interesting, but the film never develops them. Linda Fiorentino's character, the main character, is developed to two dimensions but it is difficult to sympathize or identify with her character. The peripheral characters have less development and appear as vehicles for monologues rather than possessing any depth.The script, which was written before Clerks, shows its age and its lack of development.  The cast is the best of any Smith film, but the script does not do justice to their talent. The central problem is that Smith has the tendency to write short monologues rather than dialogue.  Smith attempts to weave together monologues in the hope that he can make something develop. At times this has worked brilliantly, see Clerks, but in Dogma, it simply detracts from the film.  I suggest he study the screenplays of Elmore Leonard and David Mamet to gain a feel for how to pace and develop dialogues.  He needs to expand his writing capabilities to encompass narrative if he is ever hopes to write a successful drama.  If he continues to make films that never escape the script formula of Clerks, he will never grow as a writer.  Chasing Amy nearly escaped at some points, but it failed because Smith could not decide to write a drama or a comedy.Smith has an excellent grasp of the everyday life's banalities that often pass for depth, but his screen writing lets him down.  Will every Smith film treat us to Star Wars references or apparently glib monologues where a character deconstructs a well known icon with the assumption that they are saying something profound?  See Loki's first monologue. Characters seem to have suffered lobotomies because they cannot see through such superficial analysis. To continue to write such monologues and assume that it passes for dialogues is a waste of talent.Only two actors seem to escape the monologue trap: Alan Rickman and Linda Fiorentino.  Ben Affleck and Matt Damon try to escape and in that attempt they demonstrate their acting talent. However even they succumb.The editing breaks down from time to time. For example, the film jumps from an impending bar fight to corporate boardroom without sufficient transition.  While the boardroom scene was insightful, worshipping the golden calf, the scene dragged after that point. The scene does not add to our understanding of the film.  The final scenes also suffer from editing defects, but by that point who cares.The plot starts from a simple premise and quickly becomes needlessly confused as developments unfold with near randomness. The film does not have a strong narrative and that is a problem. Characters arrive to move the plot along by offering new monologues, but the plot does not gain any focus with the new characters. The hero and the nemesis theme works well, but the plot seems confused as to who is the real nemesis the Devil or the Angels? Another motif, the voyage, which is common in nearly all films, quickly bogs down into logical inconsistencies or simply into convenient monologue situations.  A film that demonstrates a superior use of the voyage motif is Deliverance.  Then again, Dogma does not have the narrative of Deliverance. The following are a few examples of the poor logic and the monologue enablers. If Alan Rickman's character can magically transport the characters, why have the voyage?  The monologue situation seems forced with the arrival of Rufus and the completely coincidental meeting of the main characters on the train?  The scene adds nothing to the overall plot because it reveals no new information or new motivations for any of the characters. A further logical inconsistencies is that Jay and Silent Bob, mere mortals, beat up two angels, but later are unable? Finally, why would two angels firstly talk to a devil and secondly why would they believe the devil? The devil is considered the master of all lies.On the theological points made in the film, they are not even wrong. Smith is confused about Catholicism.  Such a confusion is probably an indictment of his religious education as much as an indictment of his ability to do theological research. For example, when did the Muses appear in Catholic Doctrine?  Why does Smith seem intent on believing that God can be made to suit Man's image? Smith's material on Catholicism's foibles is simply rehashing familiar themes rather than developing anything interesting.  The jokes are already stale and the theological points he thinks he is making are dubious at best. Even the film's central theological premise is logically and theologically flawed. It can be argued that the film relies on religion in general and Catholicism in particular as a vehicle, but the material and its misinformed use detract from the film. By contrast, the film Seven, which had no theological pretensions, does a much better job using religion as general vehicle.  The Exorcist, which relies upon Catholicism in particular, proves to be superior in how it treats religion as plot vehicle.In the end, Smith appears unable to decide whether he wants to make a drama or a comedy.  It appears he possesses the ability to do comedy, but lacks the necessary script writing talent, the ability to develop a strong narrative, to create a drama.  A pity such acting and writing talent is wasted on a film that confuses irreverence for profundity and theology for drama.",Dogma

Dogma is definitely not for the devout religious out there.  I had hard time deciding how I was going to write an unbiased review when the movie ""stepped on the toes"" of so many of my own personal beliefs.I am not a big Kevin Smith fan, so that may be another reason why I didn't enjoy this movie so much.  It wasn't until after I left the theater and began thinking about the movie as a movie(rather than as an attack on my religious beliefs) that I realized that I did actually enjoy certain aspects of it.  Alan Rickman was wonderfully cast as Metatron, and truly gave a convincing performance.  Chris Rock was not at his best, however, and left me wanting more from his character.The ending sequence was way too long and drawn out, and you'd think someone a little less offensive could've played God.  Like George Burns.(They're doing wonderful things with computers these days.)All in all, this is a movie that tries to get people to laugh and to discard the politics of religion.  It was pretty slow, and the truly funny parts were few and far between.  A pretty large disappointment...save your money and catch this one on video.",Dogma

It simply makes you think, even while you are busting a gut laughing. I recommend it big time.",Dogma
570,fraud101,Better than a good laugh,6,15 November 1999,"A simple creature could only say; ""Dogma is a funny movie"".   While the statement is true, it is also a much heavier film than Kevin Smith's previous work, the indie-slacker-famed- New Jersey Trilogy.  The obvious differences were talent, not by those on the screen but by those behind the camera.  This is by far Kevin Smith's best movie, while not his funniest, or most entertaining, it was his most complete project.  It has a story line with the friendly beginning and an end.  The camera work is ever improving, going from stationary to some movement, graduating to movement that's less shaky.   Kevin Smith is one of the funniest writers/producers in the world. I would wait in a line, anywhere, anytime to see one of his films.The on screen talent was amazing.  Chris Rock, The delicious Salma Hayek, reliable Linda Fiorentino, very trendy but good Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, all were outstanding.   But the stars of the film are ""Jay and Silent Bob"". The funniest lines and the best moments all come from these.Though, I still think Clerks is the sharpest of Smith's work, Dogma is excellent and very sharp at moments with its View Askew and politically incorrect humor.  The social satire is served with some serious almost preachy moments.   These moments don't really seem out of place, but some of them don't seem to gel with Jay propositioning Bethany for sex.  Of course, that could just be me.  While, the film didn't reflect my personal religious views, I wasn't offended.   I laughed, laughed, and wanted to laugh even louder before my wife made me behave.    In short, this simple creature will say; ""I loved it.""",Dogma
571,barbragon,Rewarding though sometimes crude presentation of modern Christianity,8,16 November 1999,"Definitely worth seeing because the movie is thought-provoking and entertaining. Best were Linda Fiorentino as the last living descendant of Jesus's family (His ""great-great-great-great...""etc. grand-niece), Chris Rock as hilarious (yet sensitive) 13th apostle Rufus, and Jason Mewes as a prophet (who's unfortunately very foul-mouthed!). The British angel Metatron is pretty cool, too.I especially liked some of the ideas presented, and the overall presentation (minus the violence).",Dogma
572,prefech,Funny as Hell,10,17 November 1999,"Kevin Smith has shown his brilliance as a screenwriter in his previous movies, but never before have the actors (with the exception of Jay and Silent Bob) had this much chemistry. It is without a doubt, his finest film yet. Although there are a few slow points during the second half, the verbal assault with which the dialog is delivered keeps the audience interested. All those who have touted this movie as anti-religious, anti-church, anti-faith, etc. are incorrect. the only thing this movie is against is it's namesake, as it tells of the importance of faith and the triviality of dogma.",Dogma

It was first announced (that I saw, anyway) at the end of the credits for Clerks, which I saw on the big screen, and every since that time, I've been wanting to see Dogma. Now I finally have, and I'm a very happy camper.  :-)Great comedy, and satire of the Catholic Church.  I haven't yet talked in person to any Catholics about this movie, but I suspect that their impression will simply be that they got more of the jokes than I did.  ;-)If you liked the other Kevin Smith stuff, you'll almost certainly like this as well.",Dogma

576,p_monkey,Surprising!,9,1 December 1999,"While held back from being truly stunning by some pacing issues and some minor script awkwardnesses, Dogma is an enjoyable trip from beginning to end.  Smith plays textures like a cardshark - from action sequences to philosophical debates to stoned one-liners to dramatic monologues, the action flows remarkably smoothly for all of the twists that are thrown at it.  I was also extremely impressed by the tasteful execution of the more violent scenes, where the graphic aftermath may be shown, but the action happens off-camera.  One rough point was that a great deal of dialogue came of as expostiory - there was simply such a massive back-story (2000 years of religious history...go fig...) that it seemed at times that the plot had to fight its way through the background information.  One particular shot also irked me - in the Bethany/Metatron scene in the cafe, every time the camera cut back to Bethany, she seemed to be in the exact same pose, and break it in a very similar way.  I wonder if this was intentional, or if it was a continuity issue?  The casting of God was simply inspired - her appearance was actually one of the highlights of the film.  Towards the very end, there were some surprisingly touching moments (of course rendered through Smith's unique style), and the closing scene felt like something right out of a good ol' 80's movie (that's a good thing!).  Issues and all, a truly enjoyable film!",Dogma
577,General Conquest,A really frank and fun look at religion and the sheer wrong-headedness of blind belief,9,10 December 1999,"I went to see this flick with the highest of expectations, having waiting not-so-patiently through the delays involved with changing production companies and protests, and having built up a high regard for Kevin Smith's previous films (even Mallrats). It was not quite the Wagnerian epic I had built up in mind, but its good character-driven story and hilarious revelations still add up to one of my top picks of the year.
I would have liked a little less exposition in some parts. Linda Fiorentino spends the bulk of her screen time acting dumbfounded at the quirky antics and seemingly endless revelations provided by the rest of the cast. I didn't get enough of Jason Lee as the demon Azrael or the always-hilarious George Carlin as Cardinal Glick. But it was still a really frank and simultaneously fun treatise on Christianity and the sheer wrong-headedness of blind belief... and a cool road movie!As to the detractors of the movie, I think it's amusing that all of a sudden Catholics have become some kind of second-class citizens. I guess a couple thousand years of imperialist wars, torture, intimidation, and corruption have gone to their heads. Oh well. Maybe they can sell themselves indulgences for all their sins like in the Middle Ages -- hey, wait... that sounds familiar...",Dogma

Everyone else hopelessly tried to show the viewer they were really conscious of the irony, the humor of the movie.

580,Duncan Gunn,Think of what movies should have in them...this hasn't!,1,3 January 2000,"Kevin Smith has put together a movie which has managed to miss every important technical and spiritual aspect of good film-making. The weak characters tediously explain the plot via the poor script throughout the film; the explanations are verbose and should be unnecessary. The director evidently believes he can act? Kevin can't act for toffee, needless to say, but worse still are the attempts of other so-called esteemed actors. Alan Rickman would normally be depended on to save the day but he sinks as low as the direction and other cast members.I can confidently say that this is the worst movie I have seen to date.

Nothing like making Jesus Black,  and God a woman to challenge some commonly held beliefs. However Kevin Smith never made more than a token effort to develop these further. Using a mixture of semi credibility mixed with the totally stupid (eg the shit demon) is difficult task to bring off, and in this instance neither succeed, much less the two mixed together.

The special effects where horrendous (what the hell was the monster, an old prop from Sigmund and the Sea Monster?) The catch 22 is, this is exactly what made the movie unique and original.  I gave this movie a 7.  Add 1 point if you are a liberal.  Subtract 2 if you are a conservative.  Don't go see it if you are a practising Catholic.  Just my 2 cents.",Dogma

584,ucb_sheriff,"Intelligent, Insightful, Inspiring",9,29 January 2000,"When Kevin Smith's first theatrical release, Clerks, came out in 1995 I remember walking out of the theater thinking that this writer had an impeccable vocabulary for someone who seemed to like making movies that are very juvenile.  And as much as I liked Clerks, I never expected anything more than seeing Kevin Smith turn out movies that were more than just a pseudo intellectual penis and fart joke.  Not that there is anything wrong with those types of movies but its just that I never expected Kevin Smith to release something that deep.Fast forward to 1999, four years later and three movies later for Smith, and you have Dogma, in my opinion one of the most personal, intelligent and UNsacreligious films that have been ever made.  The plot is great, the acting is superb (well maybe not Salma Hayek, but she was there for eye candy) and the movie almost meets up to the incredible script (which I foolishly read before hand on the internet).  The cast is incredible with Affleck and Damon leading the way, Chris Rock, Jason Mewes and Fiorentino lending supporting roles and the classic Alan Rickman appearing as what else, the voice of God.  But what makes this ensemble cast work is Smith's script, this movie isn't about a couple of angels who try to end the world, its about a person's crusade for faith.  Its as if Bethany is so hell bent on going through the entire ordeal in hopes that the whole thing is a sham so she can lose her faith only to find that the little bit of faith she had in her enabled her to regain what she had lost since her childhood.Though I am a bigger fan of Clerks (37!) and Chasing Amy (Filled out like an application!) Dogma is definitely a fine stepping stone in Smith's attempt to put Red Bank, New Jersey on the map.",Dogma

Hum. Well, I went on seeing it. And what can I say? For the whole two hours the movie lasted I was always smiling and laughing, never feeling offended in anyway about some things said and done. I couldn't. They were not intended to hurt anyone. A fantastic epic-comedy that get me in the screen for what it could be an eternity. I wish it lasted longer!!!

With a huge special effects budget, the film might have produced some stunning visuals, but would have lost so much of its humour. Some extra amusement was provided by the film in-jokes that can be found in abundance.

588,lewser,'Ruler of the View Askewiverse',9,1 July 2000,"I have been a fan of Kevin Smith for a long time, a very long time. Of the three films preceeding this one my favourite was 'Mallrats', however Mallrats' place on the throne as king of the 'view askewniverse' was anything but secure. I was planning to see 'Dogma' on boxing day, but having been struck with Christmas fever I decided not to join my friends and fellow Kev lovers. That night my friend phoned me to nicely inform me how stupid I had been and how fantastic 'Dogma' was. I was bitterly disappointed and decided to see it the very next day. My friend held it in such high regard he joined me regardless of only seeing it less than 24 hours previous. To my joy I found he was absolutely right. 'Dogma' was an absolute joy to watch. It was the true ruler of the 'view askewniverse', but puns aside this became my favourite of all Kevin's movies. It has so much going for it. Kevin is such a funny man, true most of the jokes in this film include a lot of 'naughty words' but what most people do not realise is THEY ARE STILL VERY VERY VERY FUNNY.
If you have ever seen one of his films, you will know how rib splittingly, gut bustingly funny Jay and Silent Bob, the New Jersey stoners are. I can honestly say, they are at their absolute best in this their fourth movie. Jay has never been so funny, you may say this is down to Kev's script and this may be partially true but Jason Mewes has never acted so well, looked so funny and deserves a lot of credit. The best part of watching this film for a second time, is concentrating on Silent Bob even when the focus is supposed to be on somebody else because he is always doing something funny, pulling a face as somebody says something with strong sexual content or doing something with arms, you guarantee he will be doing something. This is different to his other performances, not to say they were not funny, they were very funny, but this is a fresh alternative. Watching this will help highlight how much of a comic talent this man really is.
Other highlights of this piece were Ben Affleck, someone I have always been a fan of especially in 'Chasing Amy', who was excellent in this film, he really is a fabulous actor in my opinion. I was also surprised by Matt Damon, a man I have never liked but one who was very sharp in this, after seeing this I was eager to see more of Mr Damon's work and he certainly is impressive. But the master stroke was making the leg quiveringly exquisite Salma Hayek a muse turn exotic dancer, a part she showed a talent for in Robert Rodriguez's 'From Dusk Til Dawn'. Certainly a key scene in this film is her opener. I find it hard to take my eyes off her during this film and she also plays a very entertaining role.
Full marks to Mr Smith, he has done it again. He may not have a huge following but he certainly warrants one. This was his most successful cinema outing and deserves to be. People criticise it for it's unholy content, but it has to be said, this is pathetic. It is closer to anti-freeze than anti-christ, and those who protested against it wanted nothing more than a little publicity. Kevin Smith himself is in fact a catholic, as well as this, he is a true comedy god, whoops false idol sorry, I meant he is a real comedy genius.",Dogma

Though many conservative people, mostly Catholics, found this movie both offensive and vulgar, I speaking for the laid-back Republicans, have to say that this is by far one of my favorite movies of all time.

591,leonardo da vinci,A Generation X Perspective of the Church and Christianity,3,16 March 2003,"This is an interesting flick, especially from a clergy point of view. As one trained in the ministry, and a baby boomer, this movie gives giant clues to all Christians as to why the church on planet earth is ignored today.
Written by Kevin Smith, a New Jersey raised producer/ writer, this film uses excessive violence and profanity that makes it an outsider film to most of the church going faithful. The shock value inflicts itself time and again in gory scenes written from the perspective of the world of the Generation X members of America. The interesting parts of the film are the perspectives and questions raised by the characters into the seeming failings of modern religion and or God himself...?There are numerous non sequiturs to any trained clergy who believe in the inspiration of the Scriptures. The movie becomes quite unbelievable in spots...as a for instance... it is clear from the Bible that Jesus must have been a Jewish man on earth. Either that or the whole Bible is so much contrived trash.Kevin Smith is nothing if not a shock value writer and producer as evidenced by other credits as well, such as Good Will Hunting. It is a shame that an otherwise brilliant concept and workable possible comedy is dragged down by buried issues and deep anger within the writer / director himself. I suggest that if Kevin Smith is to gain acceptance in the wider audience of grownups and mature civil audiences, he will have to learn to be less of a head case.That said, I had to watch the movie to probe and note the issues he takes with religion. It is difficult to discuss this without noting the plot, and I do not want to be a spoiler. Suffice it to say, the acting is very good, and the George Carlin segments enjoyable. I would suggest all clergy view this movie, and keep it out of the hands of those under 40 years old.",Dogma
592,chopstix,Almost good to the last drop...,7,12 December 2000,"Dogma was probably the most controversial movie in 1999, and possibly the most in the last 10 years that I can remember.  I say:  Controversy, shmontroversy...it's a good movie.  All the religious groups were in an uproar about this movie bashing Christianity and Catholocism.  Being a Christian myself, I was the least bit offended.  It's a movie, it's not a theological debate.  The biggest problem the religious groups had with this movie was that the plot of the movie was that God was fallable.  But these groups overlooked one big problem:  it took made up characters and a made up plot to do it.Now, enough with the controversy, on to the movie itself.  I thought the plot was well thought out, and all the many characters and how they affected everyone else was the most intriguing part of the story.  My only major problem with Dogma was that the ending was very rushed and very simple. It really disappointed me when after an hour and a half through the movie, they all of a sudden just said 'well, let's wrap the ending up in five minutes.' It was just a let down of an ending, but overall I liked this movie.  I'd certainly watch it again, but I would skip the ending and let my imagination finish the story.",Dogma
593,echolayte,Religious Movie,3,26 October 2019,"So i'd heard a lot've things about this film, that it's ""too controversial for digital release"" that it's ""amazingly funny"" and after watching I can confirm that i personally found neither of these to be true.From a demon made out of excrement who appeared without reason or goal, to Alan Rickman's boasting of having no sexual organs. It's hard to not think of this film as another topic for the makers of other mindless tripe such as 'Scary Movie' with such emphasis on randomness and jokes rather than expanding on the weak plot.And the plot as it is, is paper thin in substance which the characters try and cover up by explaining the plot of the film over and over again with increasingly unnecessarily complex descriptions of the same events.Despite all of this, the film wasn't all bad nearer the start as the premise of the film was introduced with an assortment of star studded actors explaining the plot and providing one or two amusing moments. But after a while after Chris Rock's entrance the film starts to go downhill in both quality and enjoyment, featuring multiple plot holes while forgetting that it's supposed to be a comedy and instead sticking with just being plain stupid for the rest of the duration.If you wanted to see the best moments of the film without watching it, just look at Chris Rock's entrance and the stripclub scene.Should've had more Silent Bob.",Dogma

What I most certainly recall is that ""Dogma"" was, undoubtedly, the worst movie I saw last year (2000). Apart from the introduction and the initial sketch on the ""restyling"" of Jesus, all the rest seems predictable and farfetched. It would be mindnumbing, if it wasn´t for the fact that you are zealously kept awake all the time. Because just when you thought you were safe, the film drags you further down the spiral of bad taste and intellectual presumption. Which is by far the main reason of my discontentment, for never before has a bad film aimed so high.

Although Smith does incorporate his trade-mark sense of humor that you expect, Dogma is not a movie to be taken lightly. Smith does bring up some very blunt and valid points that many individuals for the most part just live with as a given in reference to the Bible and organized religion. While doing so however, Smith in my opinion does not degrade or humiliate but just makes one think a little harder about such issues. I think that only Kevin Smith could pull off such a movie and not be sent up the river for doing so. Regardless of religion preference or if you are a Kevin Smith fan I highly recommend Dogma.

As a comedy, it is not funny except in a few places with broad bathroom humor. The acting is awful: among a rotund list of bad performances, Selma Hayek gives her worst. The characters are painful cliches.As a theological inquiry, it is embarrassingly uninformed and cliched as well. If Smith was earnestly trying to ask provocative questions in this movie, he came across with only the most worn and trite junior college contentions imaginable. Jesus is black; God is a woman; ""the bible was rewritten over the centuries by the powers that be""; the first two of these thoughts bespeak a notably less-than-sophisticated attempt to question Christianity and the last seems utterly obvious to anyone who has given the matter any thought. I cannot imagine that anyone would find this movie to be thought-provoking unless they have never done much thinking.It is as though Smith wanted people to watch his movie, but could not get attention by making a good one, so he lined up as many cheap shots against a popular religion as possible in order to get some attention. There are many criticisms to make of Christianity that deserve to be made, but they should be made intelligently, not with humor only fit for a child or a pot head. Lest anyone accuse me of taking what is supposed to be a light hearted, amusing romp too seriously: If one is going to try hard to critique a religion as ancient and venerable as the one Smith seems to be trying to critique, I'm afraid that religion deserves a cleverer, more sophisticated, more informed attack, not a quick skim through Elaine Pagels or Merlin Stone's ""When God Was a Woman."" Regardless of your opinion towards the follies of Christianity, an institution of this age and grandeur requires an attack of comparable grandeur, not a cheap, intellectually impoverished marijuana movie with feces guns and feces demons. You cannot try to make a light-hearted movie that takes as many shots as ""Dogma"" does against Christianity and hope to evade the annoyance of persons who have actually earnestly studied the history of religions. Was Smith simply having fun? Did he not mean this movie to be serious? I've toyed with this possibility. If so, he certainly threw a lot of effort into trying very very hard to be ""subversive.""  Regardless of his intent, the result is an amateurish and sophomoric, rather Oedipal attempt to destroy an authority figure that doesn't have that much power anymore anyway. If you want to see a movie that has an actually clever, well-done critique of Christianity, try ""The Wicker Man""; if you want to see a movie that explores the theme of angels who are immortal and must watch human sufferings and follies, try ""Wings of Desire.""",Dogma
604,kweengreen68,It's not just for the religious.,10,15 April 2003,"I'd have to say that Dogma is my favorite of all Kevin Smith's films. I think the script is brilliant, the editing and directing are darn near perfect, and let's not forget it's got both Salma Hayek and Linda Fiorentino in it!! Now, I know there are quite a few people out there who disagree with me on this and Dogma has been described as anti-Catholic, anti-Christian, and even anti-God by some but I think that's a load of bull. Most of the lead characters are angels or otherwise associated with god or the bible, and in the end, oops, can't say!(as if anyone reading this doesn't know already.) I'll just say that I was actually so impressed by this film that I bought it on VHS and on DVD and then , when the 2 disc edition came out, I bought that too. Oh, and if you're reading this and you get the idea that a person has to be Christian or Catholic to appreciate Dogma, think again! I'm an atheist.",Dogma
605,dungeon_god,Fantastic!,10,17 June 2003,"Dogma is a rich, wonderful film full of controversial and questionable rhetoric regarding Christianity and it's roots.  It brings to bear some of the problems with the church, and brings out even more of the ideas of scripture not being all there is to religion.Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are Brilliant, as is the rest of the cast.There is definitely a questioning attitude about this movie, and there is a reason for it's rating.  Yet, I found it refreshingly original and amusing, and the opening comments from Kevin Smith said everything about the movie for me.Go watch!  Probably the best movie I have ever seen.",Dogma
606,chilly_morrison,Ten Tricks To A Bad Movie (*SPOILERS*),1,8 January 2005,"1) First you need a topic. Pick something controversial so that you will attract viewers who will watch it for the subject matter rather than the overrated credentials of the director/ writer. Ps: Include lots of plot holes and about 1200 underdeveloped main characters. 2)Thenyou need a poorly written and overlong script. I strongly advise lots of unnecessary cursing and overlong religious babbling. The cursing will appeal to the thirteen year old boys and the babbling will appeal to their pseudo-intellectual older sisters/ brothers. 3)Next you need a director. Smith clearly chose to do this himself because only he could fully understand the epic scope that he envisioned for his movie. Or,more likely, he knew that he wanted to act in this claptrap, and he knew no other director would cast him. Not even as police man #8. If this is not true and he actually did want to direct then why does this movie have no direction. 4) Get an A-list of top-tier actors to appear.Wasted talent such as Matt Damon (and to a lesser extent Ben Affleck),Salma Hayek (the reason the 13 year old boys got the movie), AlanRickman (why's he dressed like he plays in a skater band?) even, ChrisRock and the legendary George Carlin, though not great actors are the 2best comedians of all time. I figured they could see when a script justisn't funny. Casting good actors is typically a good idea unless the movie is so bad that it angers their fans. As for Linda Fiorentino Isee no reason why Smith would place all of these actors around such awooden, unenthused leading lady. One thing I'll give Smith is that he gave himself and Alanis Morrisette 3 lines between them, which still proved to be more than they could handle. As for Jay? Jay should be shot in the head on national television. What an annoying character. 5)I'm not a very religious person but even i was offended that God dressed in something that would make David Bowie sick to his stomach. Hey God, Rob Rodie wants his jacket back. 6)Jason Lee as a bad guy. His overacting makes him almost as intimidating as those kids that threwcrabapples at my car. Next Smith will cast Jimmy Fallon as Idi Amin. 7)Building up bad guys only to have them die in ridiculous, embarrassing ways. Shoving the hockey kids heads into recently blessed holy water? Hitting Scout Leader Lee with a blessed golf club? Spraying the sh*t monster with Odor spray? All ridiculous ideas. And did you notice that even though there are millions of good guys in the script Smith has his character kill 2 of the main bad guys. He's like a kid that won't share his toys.Wait a second, did i just say sh*t monster? This brings me to point #8.8)Having a sh*t-monster in your movie. They have stunt men and set designers crying during the previews at the theatres about why we shouldn't download movies. How it's unfair. Well I think its unfair that Kevin Smith is making millions of dollars to write about a sh*t monster. Is this the best Hollywood has to offer? 9)Stealing jokes and situations from other movies and people. 'nuff said. 10)...Sh*tMonster!! What the fu@k is that?? Wow I used seven words and managed to fit 2 curses in. I should write the sequel. All in all I would likethank Kevin Smith for making up my mind on what is the worst movie have ever seen.",Dogma

608,kittykat9412,Tests your intelligence while making you laugh.,10,6 October 2003,"Dogma is actually a really great movie. Being from Kevin Smith, you can expect greatness, but Dogma is a cult-type movie up there with Fight Club and Spinal Tap. It dances on the line between opinionated and controversial, making strong references to religion to build up a strong plot line. Cursing is expected in a Kevin Smith movie, so it's not recommended for those who frown upon this, but the characters, their history, and how each one of them is wound into the Bible is vividly intelligent. I own the movie and I still catch things I haven't before. This movie will have you in stitches and it will make you think very deeply about life for at least two hours. I give it two thumbs up.

But it's a good thing.  I've sewn together many more luscious little details of the film than I caught the first or second time I watched it.  Great commentary on Catholic dogma, totally entertaining characters, snappy dialogue, witty references to other films both these characters and these actors have done, and Alanis Morrissette is god.

I was confused, then intrigued, then applauding the T.V set! I know its a comedy & some wouldn't take it seriously ... but for those who didn't, watch it again. The idea that God only wants you to live your life in accordance to right & wrong, & not focusing on organised religeon is comforting to someone like me (Catholic who places no belief in the system) & for many others I have talked to. It inspired me to lead a good life, free of sin & knowing that God is forever watching. Let goodwill prevail!",Dogma

Often compared with Monty P's Life of Brian, Dogma is shown even more on British telly and keeps gaining fans!! I love it! The cast is a mark of perfection and is easily one of my fave films as it never stops being funny! Chris Rock gives one of his best performances to date and Alan Rickman is at his usual mark of greatness...less stoner jokes than most the Jay and Silent Bob films (which is not always a bad thing!) this film brings not only laughter but lots to think about too...role on clerks 2...Kevin Smith is genius.",Dogma

There can be no grey line about this somewhat controversial film. Kevin Smith does it again with this hilarious movie on organised religion. The jokes are fresh and original, the characters portrayed well and with style (I even enjoyed Ben Affleck who is not a favourite actor of mine). This movie truly lives up to the hype of the previous Kevin Smith flicks like Mallrats and Clerks and will entertain anyone who has ever questioned the value of religion and whether the bible had got it right, with side splitting humour, a great cast and a killer plot. A definite recommendation on my part for any fans of great comedy. Well done!",Dogma
614,mitch-6,"dogma delights, disappoints",7,21 November 1999,"I was ready to love Dogma.  Had been looking forward to it for months.  For me it was like 3 separate movies:  comedy, religious commentary, and violent orgy.  The religious parts I thought were wonderful and thought-provoking and this was the strongest part of the movie.  But it couldn't decide if it was a comedy or a serious movie.  Sometimes comedy and serious intelligence work off one another to produce something that's poignant, like, say, the best Woody Allen movies.  Dogma doesn't achieve anything like this.  The parts I really hated were the violent ones.  Several scenes had a slapstick tone and then, as punchline, an angel who killed people.  This is totally sick and I despised these parts.What a waste of some great concepts, like George Carlin as the bishop.  And what a waste of great performances, especially by Linda Fiorentino and Matt Damon.  Oh well, we'll just have to wait for the next Kevin Smith movie, I'm sure it will be better.  For now Clerks is still his best.",Dogma

The movie started up pretty good, the idea for the plot was fine and there was some really funny lines in the beginning.Unfortunately there is some great holes in the plot (don't Loki belong in the original religion of Denmark and Norway, not in the bible? Same thing with other characters. Okay, could be it's a joke, but I don't get it). There is - IMHO - too many morality speeches and the acting is not the best ever seen.In the middle of the movie it all kinds of slow down, not so many funny remarks and in some scenes the timing didn't work at all.QED: If you are really bored, go watch this movie, but feel free to leave after 45-60 minutes, you won't miss anything.",Dogma
616,Mithells,The BEST movie this year,10,16 November 1999,"Dogma is the latest venture from Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy Writer/Director/Actor Kevin Smith. It not only lived up to it's predecessors, it surpassed them. If you go in expecting a laugh-out-loud, low brow comedy like Mallrats, you won't like Dogma. If you go in with an open mind and are expecting anything, then you'll love this movie. It's thought proking to say the least. Keep in mind this is not a typical Kevin Smith movie. This is not Chasing Amy II. It's something new and exciting from Mr. Smith that makes you think about history and life in general. It's his best movie to date, and the best movie of the year. As always though, Jay and Silent Bob steel the show. Especially when Jay ask's God who she is in the only way Jay can.",Dogma

618,Anthony-15,Highly recommended for fans and future fans alike,8,27 September 1999,"Dogma is firmly rooted in Kevin Smith's View Askew world so fans of his other films will not be disappointed. However, it also expands on the direction he took in Chasing Amy by dealing with subject matter and concepts that are personal and thought provoking. Dogma goes beyond the ""dick and fart jokes"", which are reassuringly present, and gives the viewer something to think about.The film deals with thoughts on religion, Catholicism mainly, in a way that pokes fun at the institution but does not deride it. Dogma is by no stretch of the imagination an anti-Catholic movie. It embraces religion and points out the potential and actual problems that can occur within any religious institution. The film's comments and contents are definitely meant to be taken with a grain of salt.The cast is great and there are many instances of hilarious viewing, usually Jay and Silent Bob, as well as very sensitive and expressive moments from the various actors.In the end, Dogma is a thoroughly fun and thoughtful viewing experience that both old and new fans will enjoy.

The time flies by, in fact, if this movie has any fault it's that it seems it's not long enough.  It's a wholly complex plot which is remarkably easy to follow.

Although it is a Biblical Epic it still has Jay and Silent Bob (as main characters i might add.)  It has his humor with a great new plot.

An occasional ""Ah, F**k!"" or ""Damitohell!"" can give emphasis to a frustrating moment for our protagonists. But, a running string of scatological and vulgar obscenities only calls attention to the Sophomoric level of the (writers') mentality. For example, I did not see the relevance of the shit demon in the flow of the action, except as an excuse to add some bathroom humour. Maybe it made sense to the Catholics in the audience.The casting of Alanis Morissette as God seemed odd. Why make God a simpering juvenile in the command of all these obnoxious, aggressive males?

Anyone notice at the end of the credits it said, Jay and Silent Bob will be back is Clerks 2?On a side note, I think people made too much out of the controversy in the film.

The regular characters in the forms of Jay and Silent Bob are funnier than ever (Bob actually has TWO lines in this film, and some brand new brilliant facial expressions), and the rest of the cast are terrific as well.  It was nice to see the excellent (and BRITISH) Alan Rickman get a chance to expand his acting talents in a different genre too.  Roll on Clerks 2 is all that's left to say.

I think to put it on a par or to exceed the likes of the Shawshank Redemption, The Sixth Sense, The Truman Show, Lola Rennt (the list goes on) is unbelievable!  I think to suggest it is a better film than Speed 2: Cruise Control is being rather naive!I thought this film was awful and I expected a lot better considering the widely talented cast that appears in it.  A lot of controversy has surrounded this film already due to it's religious content yet It isn't the main reason why people shouldn't go and see it.  I know I want to kick up a fuss about the film to persuade people not to go and see it!!!  It is awful. It truly is.  It was supposed to make me laugh.  It was supposed to make me think. It was supposed to make me enjoy myself.  It did nothing, except making me wish I hadn't paid £4.50 to go and see it.  I...cant put into words what I wish to say about this film.

629,LaPeta,A journey of faith filled with humor and frankness,9,13 November 1999,"For any Doubting Thomases expressing outrage at its irreverence, ""Dogma"" is a condemnation of just that--blind, bored adherence to religious dogma.  It is not anti-catholic, anti-christian, nor anti-theistic.  If anything, ""Dogma"" smacks of a journey and a suggestion to find faith (in God or god, if you prefer) in a faith-zapping world.  Smith has a mastery of writing rants and real life dialogue (ala Tarantino) and Damon, Affleck, Rock, Rickman and Lee have the give of gab that takes the real life monologues, dialogues and diatribes against racism, sexism, self-centeredness and hypocrisy to a whole new realm (without being `preachy').  And...its funny too!  (The humor I anticipated, the hidden sincerity of faith, under all the crude frankness of this modern ""stage,"" was unexpected.)Might I add that casting George Carlin as Cardinal Glick was stunning and ""divinely inspired.""   And, further, I am glad not to have read reviews or plot/cast summaries revealing the ""Almighty"" presence because the wonderful surprise (for those of us who enjoy them) of Morrisette's willingness to poke fun at herself while playing a kind divine were a treat that just might make me reconsider her music...well, we'll see...",Dogma
630,Paladin-36,"A great film, unfortunately misunderstood by supporters and detractors alike.",10,24 November 1999,"The consistent misinterpretation of this movie by its critics on both sides of the issue begged a respectful rebuttal...In all the controversy, specifically accusations by people who hadn't seen the movie, there has begun an attempt to find the Meaning, that ethereal hidden message that marks the filmmaker's true goal. However, Dogma isn't intended as a bold, revolutionary gesture, and never was. Kevin Smith has said from the beginning that the movie was never intended to be anything but an amusing little movie that would make people laugh and get them thinking about God. It isn't an attack on organized religion as a whole, it isn't an attack on Christianity as a whole, and it certainly isn't anti-Catholic by any stretch of the imagination; Smith is a practicing Catholic.I'm going to repeat that, because it automatically nullifies 90% of the attacks on the film. Kevin Smith is a practicing Catholic. He has described the movie as ""a love letter to faith."" Faith. Not even specific Belief, as noted by Rufus, but the Idea of a loving, merciful supreme being.Which is largely why I'm writing this response, not really to disagree but to clarify. It does warn against people who use God for their own purposes, wars, murders, etc. But it also states, perhaps more importantly, that the Bible is not the be-all, end-all guide to Christianity, in that it was written by humans, who are by nature fallible and prone to error. It is by no means an endorsement of literalist, no-room-for-interpretation Biblical orthodoxy. The church is not perfect. God is.This isn't really the focus of the movie, however; it's one of several themes interwoven into the whole. So how is it? It's wonderful, probably Smith's best yet. Less laugh-out-loud funny than his previous efforts, but it more than compensates with original, thought-provoking and more than a little moving scenes that any fans of Joseph Campbell, Neil Gaiman or even Garth Ennis will appreciate. And be warned, jaded Gen-X fans, it WILL make you think about God, in ways you probably hadn't before. And in that rather ambitious goal, Smith succeeds admirably.",Dogma

I suspect it appeals only to those who take an interest in the details of Christianity--how many angels on the head of a pin and all that.  The dialogue is stilted, sounding more like something being read than lines being delivered.  Similarly, the interplay between the actors is missing--they could have all been filmed separately and the clips could have been spliced together.  There is a total lack of electricity.

Reading the reviews on this page, it seems many people were scared off by religious history (mythology?) that they didn't understand...but hey, not everything is T&A and explosions, right?The movie was funny as hell, and I heard everyone in the full theater (full house all 3 times I saw it) laughing quite loudly. Good performances by all, Jason Mewes is a highlight comedy wise, Affleck and Damon (as usual) on the dramatic side.This isn't a Jim Carrey comedy, or a Bond flick...it's dialogue driven comedy with a trip onto the intelligent side. I guess that scares some people away.My favorite Kevin Smith film so far, I'm sure the next will be just as good.",Dogma

Its a great play on caste religion, with more of an emphasis on acknowldgement of god than that of one religion is better than the other.  Check out the surprise casting of GOD.",Dogma
643,Fearless Leader,Contemporary tale of faith and salvation,10,14 November 1999,"Dogma has affected me in a way that no other film ever has. It reminded me that a trust in God is truly significant, and that faith alone has the power to heal. I am not a religious person pre se, and I don't understand why there are so many God fearing people that want to keep this film under wraps. I think that Kevin Smith is a courageous and talented writer, although his skills as a director have yet to catch up. Most of the action in the film is very static, while the dialogue is truly dynamic. As usual, some of the best lines in this picture are delegated to Jason Mewes' character Jay. Dogma is nothing if not a contemporary tale of faith and salvation, and is balanced by the fact that it's funny as hell.",Dogma
644,botatt,A truely important movie,10,8 November 1999,"Rarely does a movie come along that not only entertains but tells a valuable lesson. Dogma not only asks some very enteresting questions but also gets to the heart of the problem facing our society today. It is quite clear that there is a crisis of faith in this country. Perhaps even in this world. Why is this? Is it becasue the ideas of morality are obsolete??? Or is it becasue in todays world we ahve been so deluded by establishments that they no longer hold the respect of people? THis is what we as a soceity need to face. This is what Dogma shows us. Its not about god, or a particular religion it is about virtue and how we can conquer our own fears, greed and weakness. Thank you Kevin.",Dogma
645,mporter,Outstanding movie on many levels,10,8 November 1999,"I have seen this movie twice now in two very different forms.  The first I saw was a test screening, which did need some editing, but on the whole was excellent, and the second I saw was the final version, which was well edited, but could have used a scene or two that was cut.  I enjoyed the comedy as well as the deeper religious sentiment displayed by Kevin Smith. Many religious groups have chosen to bash this movie from what they have heard, without even viewing it.  Upon watching this you will find that Kevin is totally pro-Religion, but that does not go to say that he agrees with every aspect of it, and who really does.  I myself am I follwer of the Lutheran Church, and I was in fact inspired by this films inner meaning. For those of you who wish to bash what you do not understand with out even as much as viewing it, then I say this.... I know a story, as do you, of a special man who had amazing things to say, yet because people feared and did not understand him he was put upon a cross and killed.... I am not trying to say that Kevin Smith is Jesus, nor am I saying that Dogma bashers are as bad as those who killed Jesus.... Instead I am trying to show people that you should not hate or bash what you dont understand.  Watch the movie, and then make your own judgment as to what the movie tries to accomplish.",Dogma

In addition to Smith's uproariously funny dialogue, ""Dogma"" gives the viewer an enjoyable story.

648,Persephone,Shouldn't have tried to be serious,6,11 November 1999,"Dogma has an interesting premise, potentially capable of offending just about everyone.  It's tasteless, pointless, and hilarious-- most of the time.  When the film is being funny, it succeeds wildly.  Matt Damon and Ben Afflak have their usual successful chemistry, and Jay and Silent Bob offer a delightful connection back to the first three films for fans in the know. However, when the film attempts to become serious, it descends into clichés. We've seen this mix of pop psychology, new age feel-goodism, and political correctness in every single Hollywood movie produced within the last five years about anything heavenly or angelic.  I expected something more original from the creator of Clerks and Malllrats.",Dogma

The off-the-wall casting will surely bring in the gen-X & young women in to see this movie & it'll be interesting to see the take that folks who don't consider themselves ""religious"" have on this film.

I have read some reviews and I can't believe how some people think that this movie is thought provoking.   It is far from it, nothing but cliches and many jokes, some funny, some not.  We've heard all these bible/catholic comments before which makes this movie totally unoriginal.  This movie was totally idiotic, if it wern't for some of the comedic moments this movie would have no value whatsoever.  I am not a religious type so don't cast me off like that, this movie was horribly written and just boring at times.  If you want a dark comedy, go see Very Bad Things which is very original, unpredictable and a riot.  Dogma just doesn't work at all.",Dogma

The picture was never as funny as its disclaimer.2- Talking heads involved in discussions that went all over the place and nowhere in particular.  At least Stigmata had a point (a weak one, but a point).3- Very underdeveloped ""angel from hell"" (Azrael?) character and plot role.4- Chris Rock and Carlin were under-used, Selma was over-used (unfortunately mostly her mouth).5- The picture is at least twenty minutes TOO long (but it had a number of good jokes in the rest of the movie).6- Couldn't find an uglier lesbian to play God?7- The film's demon is a piece of crap, in every sense of the word (and still more appealing than this film's God).8- Nonsensical ending.9- Great ""revelation"" of the movie: **** 10- The visuals tell the story.  Only a few seconds of this overlong movie was spent inside a church.  99.99% of the time the camera finds its limits at the front door of the church.  So do the so called anti-religious arguments.  This picture more than irreverent, is religiously irrelevant, trite and harmless.  Entertaining enough to see, but if this is the best attack of the Catholic Church then ""Mother Church"" is in much better shape than I thought.",Dogma

Everyone is so afraid to speak outloud about religion.  But Kevin hits the nail right on the head and brings out 90's religion in flashy style.  I was hooked from the New Wave Crucifixion (A smiling Jesus with a thumbs up attitude), to Chris Rock as the 13th Apostle (Who was never mentioned in the bible because he was black), to the always enjoyable Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (as the two renegade angels Loki and Bartleby), the comical interlude by Jay and Silent Bob, and Alanis Morissette as GOD!

This movie had the same appeal and feel of his previous three masterpieces with some new found religious expression.  I kinda expected a let down with his star filled feature motion picture but I was surprised to see this movie wasn't completely centered around Ben and Matt.  This movie definitely exceeded my expectations.It even had the inside jokes Kevin's true fans have come to love.  Including roles by Dante and Randal of Clerks fame. Of course Jason Lee's role as Azreal the muse turned demon was phenomenal to say the least. Man this guy rules.

I discussed the movie with some narrow minded co-workers who thought the movie was sheer blasphamy but did not realize that this movie was not a slam on god, just a different twist to a long supported truth.

Kevin Smith did Chris Rocks career no harm either by toning him down a little.I can see how some people have failed to like this film. I am the same age as KS, I am white, I am catholic etc etc, and some of the humour is helped by having that upbringing. The film did not let up from start to finish and without that background, I can understand peoples confusion.This film should NOT be criticised for being anti Christian.

This sparkling roster blends the various facets of several of today's hottest young stars to spawn a humor that is reminiscent of other Kevin Smith films such as Mallrats and Clerks, without losing any of the seriousness that is inherent in religion and philosophy.  This, combined with a captivating storyline that keeps one's mind in over-drive until the roll of the credits at the end, produces a stunningly seamless movie that's a solid success in and of  itself apart from any amount of commercial return (or lack thereof).",Dogma

I must say, though, that I (and the three others with whom I saw Dogma) thought the acting was quite bad.  Affleck and Damon were not so guilty of this, but Hayek, Rock, and particularly Fiorentino were fairly awful.  In fact, I found it bad to the point of distracting.  On another note, I have seen Clerks and Chasing Amy.  Jay and Silent Bob were a stitch in Clerks.  They were amusing in Chasing Amy.  But here, I found Jay tiresome.  It was as though someone off-camera was daring Jay to use the f-word: ""Hey, I bet you can't say it AGAIN!""  I know his schtick is to be rude and crude, but I found it excessive to where it interfered with each scene.  On a positive note, I liked Alanis Morisette as God.

Smith really tried to be as honest as he could and not just try and palm off any old thing If he really just wanted to make money do you think he would make this sort of film?

Anyone who has critisized Dogma for being offensive has really not understood the film. Dogma is full of excellent moments, not least Alanis Morissette who I thought was fabulous in her small but important role as 'God'.

The performances are all poor - although it's hard to act when you've got a billion words to say.  Speaking as a Brit, Alan Rickman's performance reminds me a lot of an old Kenny Everett punk character who I think was called Sid Snot.

Sadly, he then proceeds to write a screenplay with a ridiculously inane plot and the lamest, dumbest humour ever seen in a film that Mel Brooks didn't make. As a comedy, it's terrible... which is a real shame, seeing as the movie is a comedy! What were the actors thinking when they signed up? Did they read the script? Did it SEEM funny on paper? Did Kevin Smith really think that seeing a gag ten miles off makes it funnier? Has Kevin Smith ever actually WATCHED a comedy? Go look in the ratings breakdown for this movie. It gets a huge boost from all the teenage girls who think ""Matt & Ben are hot"" and from all the teenage boys who think ""poo-monsters"" are funny, and all of the pretentious faux-intellectual net-nerds who'll sit through anything if the dialogue sounds like Tarantino wrote it.

681,zahasj,Chesterton lives!,9,15 June 2000,"Another vote from a cradle Catholic who was not remotely offended by this movie. Not that some of the negatives mentioned by other posters here aren't true -- yes, a lot of the humor is gross, yes, the F-word is overused, yes, its criticism of organized religion is less stinging that you'd expect (though that in itself is a slightly foolish expectation, given that the writer/director is himself an active member of an organized religion). And yes, if you're not Catholic, much of the movie is a little foggy, under-explained, and not very engaging. That last one I definitely agree with; I seriously doubt whether I'd recommend the film to a non-Catholic at all.But, oh, God, I LOVED it, serious flaws and all!  It's a huge chaotic mess with about sixty different trains of thought and philosophy, from the ecstatic to the scatological, slugging it out for dominance, and in its very sloppiness there's a sense of anarchic, exultant wonder I've never seen in a movie before. The only two things like it that I can think of are Thornton Wilder's play ""Skin of Our Teeth"" and G.K. Chesterton's amazing joyous fever dream of a novel ""The Man Who Was Thursday"", both of which are works by people who may or may not have faith but who definitely have a good idea. Or several dozen of them, and who just run with them wherever they go. These works are big chaotic messes, but in that way they are mirrors of Creation, the mother of all big chaotic messes. In all these works, just as in the real world, love and joy and beauty and filth and cruelty and despair are constantly tumbling over and bleeding into each other; the one universal rule is that everything is absurd, that the human race is the most absurd thing of all, and that this absurdity can be the catalyst to either suffocating grief or a kind of hilarious wonder.If you go into ""Dogma"" expecting a trim and tidy theological comedy of manners, you'll be sorely disappointed.

It is like a mirror, primarily because it is totally un-Hollywood (which incidentally is the best thing I liked about it). It offers plenty of foot for for thought (yeah, ""foot"", not ""food"", as in ""kick somebody in the ass""), waking up those who have not been lulled to eternal sleep in the cosy beds of their proven beliefs. And it says: look and see what you have become! Aren't there IMPORTANT things out there worth doing, not talking about?

Also, I am not really certain that there was an actual written script, although someone is credited as being the writer.  It seemed to my wife and me that many of the Damon/Affleck scenes were pure adlib. Perhaps they had some religious beefs to get across - a Catholic upbringing where they were caned regularly by nuns, but I don't know if they are Catholic or any religion, actually.  Linda Fiorentino seemed to be reprising her role from ""Men in Black"" - maybe not tougher than Sigourney Weaver, but more thoughtful.

There are many reasons why I think this film is superb, one reason is that it was written and directed by the same person, Kevin Smith. When a film is written and directed by the same person it gives the film a unique flavour because the story is told through the eyes of the author and not some director with a budget.  Another reason for the film being so fantastic is because it challenges and questions the greatest story ever told, The Bible! The bible may only be a story that has no true what so ever behind it, but billions of people all over the world believe and even live by it. Dogma challenges some of the main characters of the Bible like God may be a woman and whether Jesus was black. The only other film I can think of that takes the Bible and makes a comedy out of it is 'Monty Pythons Life of Brian'Dogma is about two angels that were banished from heaven by God who find a loop hole to get back into heaven. If the angels get back into heaven then everything God has Created will be reversed, the whole of mankind will disappear.

Movies like this are not funny. They further degrade the thin moral line.  I am not trying to say that the church cannot be made fun of, but it should be done in a tasteful way and in a way that will not make religion or God (any god, whatever you believe)look bad.

698,Cousin Avi,A Deliciously Demented Religious Satire,9,7 June 2001,"The words above, pretty much sum up ""Dogma"", another often hilarious flick from the brilliant Kevin Smith. Set in the director's beloved home of Red Bank, New Jersey, Dogma's central plot line revolves around two diabolical quasi-angels, Loki(Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) cast out of heaven and sent into the only place they could be banished to more unbearable than hell- Wisconsin. Discovering that the fallible dogma in a certain Red Bank church will allow them to re-enter Heaven if they arrive there on a certain day, they head down eager to return to the Pearly Gates to wreak more havoc. The person best suited to foil their plan is Bethany Sloane (Linda Fiorentino), an abortion clinic worker who is revealed to be the last descendant of Jesus Christ- the reason why the neurotic Metatron, the winged Voice of God (an absolutely uproarious Alan Rickman) appears in her bedroom to recruit her. Along for the ride (Jason Mewes and Smith himself as Smith's recurring slacker characters Jay and Silent Bob, with larger roles and, in Jay's case, funnier dialogue than ever), and Rufus, the outcasted black 13th Apostle (Chris Rock, whose screechy style does little to detriment the delivery of his high-quality jokes.) Meanwhile, a sinister plan involving total destruction is being hatched by the demon Azrael (Smith regular Jason Lee) and his three frighteningly sephulchral, hockey-stick-wielding lackeys. Showing up for cameos are George Carlin as the loopy Cardinal Ignatius Glick, promoting a toothily-smiling, thumbsup-flashing ""buddy Christ"", Janeane Garofalo as Bethany's fellow abortion clinic worker, and Alanis Morrissette as a quirkily ecstatic interpretation of a female Big Boss.Smith's dialogues is typically phenomenal, with very few jokes falling flat (an uninspired ""s**t demon"" sequence is made up for by the collection of witty dialogue given to Rock, Mewes and Rickman- and Smith's Silent Bob is so cool that he commands mention.) The cast is unanimously effective, with the four actors quoted above giving particularly enjoyable performances. All in all, a twisted Catholicism  satire to be cherished. 84/100, ***1/2, A-",Dogma

If you ignore all of the language and watch it with a open mind you truly do ""get a good idea"" about what God is all about. Particularly the line about it isn't what you have faith in it is that you have faith that is important. I think The Big Guy/Gal upstairs would willingly get past all the language to have that very important fact stated.

The old couple of Affleck and Damons (when they still appeared in pal Smiths flicks) plays the two fallen angels Loki and Barthelby who finds a loop hole in the dogmatic law and sees their opportunity to get back into heaven. A small but not insignificant problem is that this little plan would stop the universe from existing. Ouch.Never, before or after, has religion so open heartedly been spoken about as here. The difference from a lot of other religious comedies is that faith never is ridiculed here, Kevin Smith himself went to catholic school. Instead this is his way to ask all those questions he as a man of faith, obviously, should have. For an atheist, it's hilarious! In the opening scene Matt Damon converts a nun by comparing religion to Alice in WonderlandDogma is the highlight of Kevin Smiths career where the pop culture icons Jay & Silent Bob (the latter played by Smith himself) fits the best in with all the other fantastical characters such as Jason Lees demon, Salma Hayeks stripping muse and George Carlins thinking-out- side-of-the-box cardinal.",Dogma

I found that Dogma brought up many interesting ideas related to religion, faith and belief, avenues of thought I'd never explored before; and when it comes to great beings in the sky, who knows. Maybe all the stuff in the film is probable. I LOVED Loki (Matt Damon), his passion for smiting coupled with a conscience and sympathy for humans. Darn, the rest of the cast is blindingly fantastic as well; but I found that one of the best performances in the film was from Ben Affleck.

Jay has some of his laugh out loud funniest one liners yet. But what really makes this a great film is that it is genuinely thought provoking.There are religious people out there who will criticize this film as being anti religion, anti Catholicism, when it is anything but (well, a little anti Cathlic maybe). The central theme to the film is that there is a God, but not the God that most people know (or think they know) or believe in. The characters in the film are trying to get the message across that people have changed the original God, man has made God into the image they want him/her to be, made their own religious rules, rules that God never intended.

Any film that will take on theological issues and problems of faith in this day and age is worth the tip of a hat.

The Church has taken many hits throughout the centuries, many deserved but many undeserved. The criticism heaped upon here falls squarely in the latter. As a religion or a personal philosophy the Catholic Church does not have a monopoly on guilt, as the movie would present. Also, it suggests that the mass, if not religious ritual in general, are boring, tedious exercises that are irrelevant to our lives. This too is yet another tired criticism. People expect entertainment from everything these days. Ironically the movie suggest this through the Voice of God, Metratron, who gets exasperated with those whose knowledge of religion comes only from Hollywood. This exasperation should hold true for those whose criticism of religion comes entirely from ideas acquired through the entertainment industrythis movie for example. In other points, the sexual references are amusing only for shock value and inconsistent with the plot of the story. Loki, the angel of death, finds those guilty of sexual excesses to be sinful and worthy of divine vengeance, (They and we have no sympathy for the corporate board members whose sexual sins are considered deviant and abhorrent). Oddly enough, we are suppose to find it amusing (and hip and interesting) when the ""good"" guys are obsessed with sexJay and Silent Bob and Rufus' characters. In addition the revelation by Rufus (the 13th apostle) that ideas should be exchanged for beliefs is really a question of semantics and basically pointless statement that tries to makes us feel good about our society which increasingly believes in nothingreligious, philosophical or ideologicalexcept our own search for physical and emotional gratification. The movie forgets that people have fought and died over ideas too--or more to the point that beliefs are ideas. In addition ideas, without the benefit of faith can be quite hollow and unfulfilling. People who enter marriage because they think it is a good idea, rather than a belief, a leap of faith and trust, in their commitment and love for one another are most likely in for a short relationship. Marriage, parenthood, and public service require faithfulness, loyalty and a belief in an ideal.Ultimately the movie gives vent to some of our frustrations with organized religion, but it paints with such a broad brush that its criticisms are meaningless. The movie doesn't really understand the very things it criticizes. I found the movie very interesting. Any film that will take on theological issues and problems of faith in this day and age is worth the tip of a hat. However, I found the criticisms of the church to be shallow, the stuff of high school ""bs"" sessions filled with self righteous indignation, nothing theological.

Kevin Smith has perfectly captured a mix of comedy, action and drama that every film maker strives to obtain. If you have ever seen any of kevin smiths films, and liked them, you will fall in love with this movie. As I did. All of Kevins movies are excellent but this on takes the cake. Believe me. I own every one of his films and will continue to as an extremely enthusiastic fanatic.See Dogma. Also do yourself a favor and pick up ""An evening with kevin smith"" you will love it. Its is in depth and personal with the best of all time. Kevin smith",Dogma
729,Mewesmuse67,A Journey?,10,14 December 2003,"Dogma is the best Kevin Smith movie. When I first watched the movie I was unaware of all the hoopla surrounding it. I never saw this movie as trying to preach to anyone. I liked the idea and saw it more as a film about a journey, a journey to find oneself.I never really watch a film to get a message out of it. I think Dogma was original and entertaining. Isn't that what the film maker usually strives for?",Dogma
730,model-ford,Another testament to Smith's banality,3,23 January 2011,"I haven't seen Dogma for years but was prompted to write something after being forced to sit through Clerks 2.I chose Dogma because it was the movie that plunged the nail in the coffin for me in regards to Smith's surprisingly successful career.I know Dogma is a big thing for Smith fans but it was such a hackneyed, lazy, low brow, self indulgent turd that I truly can't understand why.Did I expect too much after the hilarious (when I was 16) Clerks? In comparison Dogma is trite, forced, laborious and worst of all unfunny.The problem with Smith is, and this infects all his movies, he thinks his mundane observations on life can sustain not just two or three hours, but a whole catalogue of films.Clerks worked because it was fresh, amateurish, and somewhat fearless. It was the first time audiences were exposed to Smith.And he came out swinging - this is what I think about censorship/porn, jocks, religion, love, the system. It was a movie about rebellion and this resonated with a lot of white 15-year-old males.But you can't make movie after movie on the same premise. Filmmakers are meant to grow (Cohen brothers) and take audiences with them.In this sense those 15-year-olds who followed Smith, and who he owes his career to, have been cheated. His thoughts on Christians (and I'm an atheist) are the same he had 15 years ago. Yet he still has his faithful followers shell out to see them writ large, every couple of years.His growth, or lack of it, as a filmmaker is outpaced by his budgets. When $10,000 (Clerks) suddenly becomes $10 million (Dogma) and yet all you get are the same gags, surely audiences have a right to feel cheated and short-changed.I feel sorry for Smith. I'm sure sitting through one of his films is as frustrating and unpleasant for him as it is for me.Here is a filmmaker who tried to branch out (Jersey Girl) but failed catastrophically. This forced him to revert back to dick jokes and resort to Hollywood mechanisms – sequels, star cameos – to sustain a career. The very things he thrashed against in Clerks.He wants to be taken seriously as a filmmaker but at the same time uses gay jokes and bestiality to get a laugh. While this is quite obviously a sign of a director lacking vision or inspiration Smith claims these devices are his way of keeping it real, a kind of 'hey I'm still the same guy I was 20 years ago, success hasn't changed me'. Damn straight.And that's where my real annoyance with Smith comes from. If he just put his hand up and admitted to being lucky because he built a career off one film and now gets paid to do what he loves, I'd be happy.Instead he is a conceited git who tries to pass off his films as something more than uninspired garbage.I see his latest film is about a cop (Bruce Willis) whose baseball card is stolen. Oh the hilarity",Dogma
731,Sir_Narf,"The Best Movie On Religion, Including Mel Gibson's Film",10,12 March 2004,"While I do not disparage anyone's faith or beliefs, I am truly bothered by those people who are ""so heavenly-minded they're no earthly good"". I myself am religious. I do believe there is something beyond this life; but I do not think any religion has the inside track, not even mine.
""Dogma"" is the best movie on faith because it makes you question things. Some might see it as insulting to Christianity, Catholicism in particular. That is for them to deal with. I see it as thought-provoking and very deep religiously. Yes, I said ""religiously"". It makes you think. Blind acceptance is no life at all. Free Will is a gift. How you use it is up to you. Clarence Darrow once said, ""The fear of God is not the beginning of wisdom. It is better to have doubt. Doubt leads to investigation and THAT'S the beginning of wisdom.""And there is no doubt that ""Dogma"" will make you think, as well as make you laugh. I laughed all the way through it.

732,ajbruno,The best of Kevin Smith's movies with Jay & Silent Bob in it,10,29 March 2004,"To me, DOGMA is the best-written and well-paced movie that Kevin Smith has written and directed. Being a Catholic, many of the topics hit the nail on the head. Bureaucracy, belief systems and dogmatic tenets destroy what should be a great idea concerning God. Kevin Smith gets this point across time and again without beating you over the head with it.Plus, the actors really seem to enjoy the material. Affleck and Damon excel as the two outcast angels. Their banter is worth the movie alone. Add Jason Lee as Loki, and the story really shines.This is actually the second Smith movie I saw, Mallrats being the first. And I enjoyed that one also. This propelled me to go and buy Clerks and Chasing Amy and then J&SB Strike Back. I have been a fan of his writing ever since.",Dogma

This is the first time I have bothered to write a review of any kind, but I felt compelled to since so many other users were giving it bad marks. Dogma is worth seeing, and then buying! Out of all of the Kevin Smith movies so far, this one is the best. There are NOT too many characters, they are what keep it interesting! Other Kevin Smith Movies include: Clerks Mallrats Chasing Amy Dogma Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back",Dogma
734,go_nd1,Pure Praise,10,7 September 2004,"I don't know if my catholic upbringing has something to do with my views on this movie or not. But I watch this religously (no pun intended?). I just can't get enough of this movie. Rock, Rickman, Afflack, Damon, Carlin, Lee, and Hayak are all absolutely outstanding in this movie. This may very well be the best work Mewes has ever done. Maybe it has something to do with that ""Rickman dude"". And of course, Smith delivers another outstanding performance with his great facial expressions and timing. But the best part once again is Smith's writing. I think this movie speaks for a lot of 20-30 year olds that were brought up to fear God in a Catholic home. Really makes you think about the entire ""religon"" thing.",Dogma
735,trapp-anthony,Pretty Good,8,28 March 2013,"Dogma is a Kevin Smith film that addresses religion and other topic that some may deem controversial. Basically the film follows the adventures of two fallen angels, one being the angel of death, who is stuck to roam the earth for the rest of existence. Once they find a loophole in the system which would allow them to return to heaven, they jump at the opportunity and head to New Jersey where salvation lies not knowing that once they complete their return, their existence will be lost. The themes that were presented in this film were thinly veiled in the subtext but pretty obvious once I realized it. I would have originally thought the theme was religion, but acceptance seems like a more reliable theme to go off of then religion. Religion just seemed too obvious and the fact that everyone in the movie has trouble accepting the situation around them just seems fitting.",Dogma

I'm an Atheist, brought up in a not particularly religious household, and I still loved it. I suppose you do need some prior interest in theology or religion (I'm saying this bit from the point of view of a Religious Studies and Philosophy student), because this film is not just silly mindless comedy - parts of it are intelligent, inspiring and thought-provoking.The cast is absolutely great, and I was particularly impressed with Jason Lee's performance.

I think anybody who has ever questioned Christ and the whole existence of it can relate in this movie, and it is not only smart but funny as hell. The plot is one of the most original of all that I've ever seen. Hell the whole movie is original with very small pieces of cliché in it. The acting in my opinion was tremendous although most people would probably disagree with me there I think that this was one of the few movies Affleck actually belonged in, same for Damon. Of course Jay & Silent Bob are a riot again, and Alan Rickman was tremendous as usual, the script was excellent, basically the whole thing was just a piece of comic brilliance.",Dogma

It's unoriginal, trite and patronising. If a film isn't funny, doesn't work as satire, creates no tension, possesses no discernible plot and possessed of a mix of asinine humour and failed attempts to ""shock"" us with its ooh-how-daring swipes at our ideas of faith (a boring subject at the best of times), I am afraid no amount of pretend-radical theorising is going to rescue a very poorly made film such as this.

For a scholarly stickler suck as myself, there are a few too many mixed references here (Loki, Norse God of Mischief as a Catholic Angel, and Azrael as a Fallen Angel; Azrael is the actual name of the angel of death, whom Damon plays as Loki), but otherwise an excellent film.The point is being decidedly missed if you are watching this film to be educated about Christianity. This is a damn good laugh.

I give this a movie and 8 because it is very intelligent and unique. Very few movies deal with serious religious themes in such a dark comedic satire.

This is Hollywood at its worst. I like Chris Rock's part but everyone else was dull. It was basically a gross movie that didn't make any sense or have a message.

744,johnhamelers,I'll never tire of this movie!,10,4 August 2019,"Kevin Smith's Dogma is a celebrity filled laugh fest. George Carlin, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Linda Fiorentino, Janeane Garofalo, Jason Lee, Alan Rickman, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Chris Rock, Salma Hayek, and Alannis Morissette round out the cast in this genius comedy
Loki(Damon) and Bartleby(Affleck) are angels who have been thrown out of heaven and into Wisconsin by God. They hear about a Jubilee in New Jersey that will cleanse them of sin and allow them back into heaven. Unfortunately this would prove God to be fallible and thus erasing existence. Metatron(Rickman) is sent to recruit Bethany(Fiorentino) to stop the angels before this happens. Along the way she meets the 13th apostle, Rufus(Rock), the Muse(Hayek), and the prophets Jay and Silent Bob(Mewes and Smith).
This is not your typical ""Good vs. Evil"" as the antagonistic characters are angels trying to get back to heaven. The protagonists are a rag tag group of misfits. None the less, the angels are evil as they are actively going to eliminate existence as we know it. Whether evil by ignorance or by indifference, they have to be regarded as evil.
Bethany is not the typical hero. I feel that is almost an oxymoron by now as there are so many movies with that tag line for the hero. She has no interest in being the savior of the universe. Metatron has to push her into it and push hard. Along the way, her support is obviously not the cream of the crop. The 13th apostle and Jay and Silent Bob the prophets? This is not how a super team is built.
As the movie progresses, you find there is truly evil behind the angels. Azrael(Lee) is guiding them to the end of the universe. When angels partner with demons, there's an obvious problem. You also find out that this was all Azrael's plan from the beginning. Upon both the angels and the motley crew led by Bethany arrive at the church, all heaven breaks loose!
This might sound weird, but this movie reminds me somewhat of the Goonies. The good versus evil theme is clear in both films. There is a goal for each of the good guys' groups to secure their property(the child's home and the universe). Each movie has a surprise bad guy switching sides. Most of all, both movies are very funny!
The way the film is shot, it adds to the good versus evil vibe. Azrael is always wearing something befitting of a demon and is always shown being devious. Being shot in full body often makes him look more powerful, even though he is obviously not as powerful as he would lead you to believe.
The lighting matches the mood in each scene as well. The bright light of the boardwalk being snuffed out. The right before sunset sky at the final battle symbolizing walking on the precipice of destruction. Even the strip club lighting where another battle is fought is illuminated perfectly so it's both believable and visually stimulating.
Kevin Smith has shown again and again that he is a good guy when behind the camera as well as in front. Dogma is another in the win column for the good guys.",Dogma

It has an overall great message too. Watch it, seriously. Especially if you love Jay and Silent Bob movies. Bethany (a woman who has lost her faith in God, but is also the last Zion aka Jesus's distant relative) is sent by Metatron (Alan Rickman!) to stop two renegade fallen angels (Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartelby (Ben Afflek)). She meets up with two prophets, Jay and Silent Bob (Heck Yes!), the 13th apostle Rufus (Chris Rock) and the former muse Serendipity (Salma Hayek).
