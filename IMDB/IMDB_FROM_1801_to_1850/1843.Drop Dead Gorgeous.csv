0,MartinHafer,exceptionally funny and exceptionally silly,9,16 June 2005,"Leonard Maltin hated this movie and instead he recommended watching the movie SMILE (1975). Well, I would say the exact opposite--DROP DEAD GORGEOUS is hilarious (though not exactly subtle) and SMILE is a not particularly good comedy (though it was original).As I said above, the movie wasn't subtle but a very silly and completely over-the-top look at Junior Miss-type pageants.Ellen Barkin does a great job of playing ""trailer trash"" and Kirstie Alley plays the rich broad who feels she IS the pageant. Both actresses were not particular favorites of mine, but this movie helped changed my opinion as they did great jobs and really stayed in character.Kirsten Dunst and Denise Richards headlined the small cast of girls competing for the local Minnesota pageant--the winner of which will go to the state championship. What happens along the way has got to be seen to be believed! If I told you in this review, it would reveal too much.This movie is strongly recommended if you just want a good laugh. If you want cerebral comedy, this is not it! The only negative is the very strong language, so parents are recommended to consider this before showing it to younger kids.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
1,SnoopyStyle,needs to be funnier,6,13 November 2016,"It's 1995. The Sarah Rose Cosmetics American Teen Princess Pageant is the oldest beauty contest celebrating its 50th anniversary. In the rural town of Mount Rose, Minnesota, a documentary crew is filming the local chapter of the pageant run by Gladys Leeman (Kirstie Alley). Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst) is a hardworking, optimistic contestant following her cynical mother Annette Atkins (Ellen Barkin) and Diane Sawyer's footsteps. Loretta (Allison Janney) is their trailer park neighbor. Another contestant Tammy gets blown up in an unusual incident. She was the president of the gun club which rich girl Becky Leeman (Denise Richards) wanted. Amber's goofy friend Lisa Swenson (Brittany Murphy), perky cheerleader Leslie Miller (Amy Adams), and other wacky girls have also entered the pageant. There are creepy guys doing the judging. Another mysterious death occurs and Amber is suspicious.This is a faux documentary like a Christopher Guest movie except not as good. The idea is full of quirky potential. There are some chuckle moments but there isn't enough comedy. It needs those laugh out loud moments to keep going. The deadpan deliveries are expected to be funny by themselves but they're not. Dunst is great and these lovely girls do try. Overall, it just needs to be funnier.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
2,lee_eisenberg,one shot,7,9 August 2006,"""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" is one of those movies that might leave a bad taste in your mouth, but also a sweet taste in your mouth. Portraying a beauty contest involving a lot of nasty tricks, they're not trying to be cute with this movie; they're trying to bite everything right where it hurts, and they succeed. I, for one, wouldn't be surprised if many beauty pageants involve the stuff portrayed here.So, it's debatable whether or not we call this a gorgeous movie or a drop dead movie, but I wish to assert that it is worth seeing. Their accents will probably remind you of ""Fargo"", and Kirstie Alley's character is likely to make your skin crawl. Also starring Kirsten Dunst, Ellen Barkin, Allison Janney, Denise Richards and Mindy Sterling (Frau in the Austin Powers movies).Lutefisk. Ha!",Drop Dead Gorgeous
3,jboothmillard,Drop Dead Gorgeous,5,29 December 2009,"I had seen a trailer for this girlie fashion film, and as I can be a sucker for cheesy films with good people in it, I decided I should at least try this one. Basically in Mount Rose, Minnesota, the small town has a film crew filming the preparations for Sarah Rose Cosmetics Mount Rose American Teen Princess Pageant. Competitors in the competition include Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst), Rebecca 'Becky' Ann Leeman (Denise Richards), Leslie Miller (introducing Amy Adams) and Lisa Swenson (the recently deceased Brittany Murphy), all with their own ""unique"" talents and aspirations to win, being most beautiful and sticking to the rules. As the competition hots up it is obvious the girls will do anything to win that coveted title and crown, and even the parents, including Gladys Leeman (Kirstie Alley) and Annette Atkins (Ellen Barkin) are getting aggressive with each other. Eventually a winner is chosen, Becky, who goes on a float for the victory parade, which explodes, passing the crown on to second place runner up Amber. Also starring Allison Janney as Loretta, Will Sasso as Hank Vilmes, Mindy Sterling as Iris Clark, Sam McMurray as Lester Leeman, Michael McShane as Harold Vilmes, Mo Gaffney as Terry Macy, Nora Dunn as Colleen Douglas, Matt Malloy as John Dough, Lona Williams as Jean Kangas and Batman's Adam West. The documentary style is an interesting decision, the performers all get their moments, and there are some good dark humoured moments, so it is certainly a some-what likable independent black comedy. Worth watching!",Drop Dead Gorgeous
4,michaelRokeefe,If you don't deserve it; you deceive to get it.,7,29 August 2001,"This is a semi-hilarious mock documentary about a teen beauty contest in Minnesota. Anywhere from hilarious to ridiculous and all points in between. The only thing redeeming is Kirsten Dunst. She knows how to get your pity, concern and loyalty. Ellen Barkin is hardly recognized as Kirsten's drunken mother. Kirstie Alley is pretty darn good as the dirty dealing former beauty queen and mother of the obvious next winner(Denise Richards). Miss Richards' character is beautiful; but spoiled, pampered and a bitch. Not exactly an expose, because the behind the scenes back stabbing is assumed to be part of a beauty pageant. Tongue-in-cheek humor. Nevertheless another vehicle for the talented Miss Dunst.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

6,hitchcockthelegend,"Yeah yeah, drop dead gorgeous; literally.",6,12 December 2010,"Drop Dead Gorgeous is directed by Michael Patrick Jann and stars Kirstie Alley, Ellen Barkin, Denise Richards, Brittany Murphy and Kirsten Dunst. Written and produced by Lona Williams it's shot in a mockumentary format and follows the contestants in a beauty pageant called the Sarah Rose Cosmetics Mount Rose American Teen Princess Pageant, held in the small town of Mount Rose, Minnesota. It seems that some parents, and some girls, will stop at nothing to win this particular contest.It's pretty evident quite early on in Jann's film that this is no ordinary look at Middle America. This is biting satire that pokes the soft underbelly of those so fascinated by beauty pageants out there in the good old U.S. of A. The roll call of gags, both visually and orally, reads like one of Lucifer's best of lists; featuring anorexia, amputees, burns victims, perversion and Jesus gets a kicking too. Yet it's not shock tactics that are the order of the day, the writing from Williams (notably once a Minnesota pageant queen herself) is very aware and steers safely away from charges of crudeness. Sure, some things may offend, but the film is structured in such a way (the docu team angle is excellently realised) it's all very hard to take seriously: and rightly so.The cast perhaps unsurprisingly are mostly female, what guys are involved are either perverts, dunces, weirdos or dead! In the Mother corners we have Kirstie Alley & Ellen Barkin, with both ladies wonderfully rising to the tongue in cheek occasion, and representing the daughters are trailer trash Kirsten Dunst and spoiled rich kid beauty Denise Richards. Allison Janney provides wise cracking-man hungry-comic relief, while the petite line of contestants contains the likes of Brittany Murphy and Amy Adams. All do good work for the spiky script, where the film falls down, however, is with it's rather pointless last 20 to 30 minutes. Possibly it's down to inexperience on the part of the makers that the film loses its way? We have the big contest shenanigans and a kicker of a twist to boot, but then have to suffer a number of convo's and time fillers that aren't really needed. We can accept Richards looking about 5 years too old for this particular contest, but half hour of film speaking to god knows who? We can not.Still, it's a fun in a sickly kind of way movie, one that is bold and lit up by some very rewarding acting performances. 6.5/10",Drop Dead Gorgeous
7,Theo Robertson,Dead On Its Feet Would Be A Better Title,2,16 February 2003,"With the success of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT ( Well financial success , artistically that film was crap ) I`m surprised that more people didn`t jump on the band wagon of making spoof documentaries , but if DROP DEAD GORGEOUS is anything to go by I`m very glad they didn`t . As at least one other reviewer pointed out the movie hardly ever looks like it`s a documentary because the director uses too many camera shots and angles when shooting and he casts several well known faces which means - Unlike SPINAL TAP - absolutely no one will be taken in by this mockumentary . Even if hadn`t been done as a spoof DROP DEAD GORGEOUS would still be a poor comedy because the script is full of ludicrous characters and situations that bare no relation to reality . It`s not satire , it`s farce and a very silly farce at that",Drop Dead Gorgeous
8,jotix100,Looks can kill you,7,30 November 2006,"The world of the teen beauty pageants is at center stage in this satire that is set in Mount Rose, Minnesota, a town where Lutherans appear to be a majority. The 50th anniversary of Miss Teen Princess America attracts a lot of the young women in town. The message in the film appears to be that being beautiful can kill you, sometimes.Gladys Leeman, a former winner, is one of the organizers. Her own daughter, Becky, is competing. She is a prominent citizen of Mount Rose, with her own agenda. The competing girls come from different social backgrounds. One of the most talented ones is Amber, a girl that lives in a trailer park with her alcoholic mother.Mysterious things begin happening to different participants in the contest, the most serious one occurs to Annette Atkins, Amber's mother, whose trailer catches fire and her hand gets attached to the beer can she was drinking. Amber, who is clearly the most talented girl in the contest, loses to Becky, something one knew was coming from the start of the competition.There are funny moments in this film, which was directed by Michael Patrick Jann, and written by Lona Williams who seems to know a great deal about these beauty contests. Somehow, the film must have seem funnier to its creators. There are good moments like Becky's selection for the talent portion of the show. Also, the way most of the girls competing in the state portion of the competition get sick after eating sea food.Kirsten Dunst makes an appealing Amber, the nice girl from the wrong side of town. Kirstie Alley is the force behind the contest and the woman who dominates everything in Mount Rose. Ellen Barkin has some good moments as Annette, but what happens to her is not as funny as it must have looked to the creators of the film. Allison Janney is seen as Loretta, Annette's trailer park neighbor. Denise Richards adds her beauty to the film. Amy Adams, an uncommon talented actress, has a small part as Leslie, a girl that loves boys and ends up having quite a career!",Drop Dead Gorgeous
9,lastliberal,Kirsten Dunst is a princess,7,9 April 2007,"Kirsten Dunst was the cutest thing in the black comedy about the pursuit of the American dream. Showing that fantasy and reality often mirror each other, one is reminded in this film of the Texas mother who hired a hit-man to go after the mom and her cheerleader daughter. Here, it is mom (Kirstie Alley) herself that uses murder to fix a beauty pageant for her daughter (Denise Richards).The biggest laughs in this satire comes from Ellen Barkin, who played Durst's trailer-trash mom and mom's friend Loretta (Allison Janney). They both had incredibly fake Minnesota accents.Adding to the laughs was the fact that just about everyone in this film smoke and drank constantly - not what you would expect at a teen pageant.Supporting was Sin City's Brittany Murphy and Matt Malloy as a sleazy judge. I know I will leave out some other fine performers as there were too many to mention.It was just a hoot and a thoroughly enjoyable movie about the business of pageants. Worth a look for Dunst and Richards alone.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
10,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Pretty good black comedy spoofing teen beauty contests,7,19 January 2004,"When I first sat down to watch this, I was quick to judge it as a dud. About ten or twenty minutes into it, I suddenly started to love pretty much every second of it. It doesn't last every single second of the movie, but most of it is really funny. If you're into black humor you should definitely check it out. All of the main characters have a very distinct dialect for the entire movie, which at first seems annoying, but eventually you grow to love it, and laugh at it. The acting is mostly acceptable, as most the characters are laughable stereotypes. The movie is very black, one of the most pitch black I've ever seen, so if you don't think you can stand extreme black humor, or you're easily offended, you should definitely avoid this film. It isn't for everybody's taste, and most people probably won't like it. It's gold for any fan of black humor though, if you like a movie like One night at McCools, you'll probably like this one too. It's made in the style of a documentary, I think the genre is called ""mockumentary"". Once again, not for everyones taste, but worth watching for fans of black humor. 7/10",Drop Dead Gorgeous
11,Uriah43,"A Satirical View of Small Town, USA",6,26 May 2017,"This film takes place in the small Minnesota town of ""Mount Rose"" where a teenage beauty pageant is about to be held. Although this pageant is held there every year what makes this one somewhat unique is the fact that the head of the pageant ""Gladys Leeman"" (Kirstie Allen) has her own daughter ""Rebecca Leeman"" (Denise Richards) as one of the contestants. To make matters even worse, Gladys is the wife of the richest man in the town and as a result she has a great deal of influence over the judges. Yet in spite of this the contest remains in doubt as there are a few young ladies who pose as obstacles to Rebecca's success. And it's then that they each start dying under mysterious circumstances one by one. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, although some of the humor was rather crude, the director (Michael Patrick Jann) and writer (Lona Williams) really managed to capture the hypocrisy and self-righteous bigotry of some of the people who happen to reside in small towns. Naturally, not all small towns are as bad as this film portrays and not all people are as shallow-minded as shown here either. But there is definitely a problem in some small towns and this film nails it really well. Be that as it may, I really liked the performance of Allison Janney (as ""Loretta"") who I thought was totally hilarious. Likewise, having several attractive actresses like Kirsten Dunst (as ""Amber Atkins""), Amy Adams (""Leslie Miller"") and the aforementioned Denise Richards certainly didn't hurt in any way either. All things considered then, I rate this movie as slightly above average and recommend it to those who might be interested in a satirical film of this type.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
12,anaconda-40658,Drop Dead Hilarious!,10,30 July 2015,"Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999): Dir: Michael Patrick Jann / Cast: Kirstie Alley, Kirsten Dunst, Denise Richards, Ellen Barkin, Allison Janney: Hilarious satire of beauty pageants and the deadly act of pride as beautiful faces conceal fuming hatred. The girls assemble in front of cameras and discuss their dreams then go through the pains and gains of preparations. Directed by Michael Patrick Jann who has an eye for comic timing and details the film with colourful sets. Kirstie Alley plays a past winner whose motives that are less than honorable. She represents the mother who pushes her daughter into where she once shined in order to relive the memory but her greed leads to downfall. Her daughter is played by Denise Richards who was given a gun and ""aims to win"" at the pageant. Kirsten Dunst lives in a trailer park with her mother and works at the local morgue. Dunst and Richards are not just at odds within the competition but also competing for the affections of the same male. Ellen Barkin is hilarious as Dunst's mother with a beer can burned into her hand after their trailer suffers an explosion. Allison Janney is also in top comic form as a friend of Barkin's who helps Dunst get preparation. Even the judges are out to lunch in their total lack of knowledge or experience in these events. It presents the false galore of judging physical beauty resulting in a comedy that is drop dead hilarious. Score: 10 / 10",Drop Dead Gorgeous
13,The_Void,"Intelligent, witty and biting dark satire",8,16 July 2004,"Drop Dead Gorgeous is a film about a teenage beauty pageant. As you might expect; it features plenty of young girls in skimpy outfits, dancing, singing and all that crap. However, unlike a lot of films of the same ilk; here, hidden behind a facade of teen beauty and all the other trademarks of the teen comedy genre, is an intelligently written, witty and very dark satire on the consumer society.Drop Dead Gorgeous is a filmed in the style of a documentary, a la 'This is Spinal Tap' and follows the escapades of a group of contenders in the annual beauty pageant. The contenders are introduced via a very amusing sequence, which sees them tell the audience about themselves. It's very MTV in the way it's done, with all the girls introducing themselves as shallow, fussy, typical teenage girls. After that, the film starts to set its dark tone, with one of the girls being blown up, and is the tone that will be carried throughout the rest of the movie. Some of the humour in this movie is so dark that even I, a fan of very black comedy, couldn't decide whether to laugh at or not; a woman that gets a beer can melted to her hand, an anorexic previous winner, and the pageant winner being blown up on a huge float are all included in this movie. It's lighter and more tongue in cheek moments are also done very well, such as the part in which one of the judge's brothers gets caught in the car door, or a hilarious 'home video' of an explosion.The characters in Drop Dead Gorgeous are all, with the exception of Amber Atkins, disagreeable, shallow and overblown stereotypes. This is one of this movie's main assets; it has the parodying of stereotypical people spot on; we've got an ""I'm not a pervert"" pervert judge, an insensitive, egotistical head of the richest family in town, the overenthusiastic boyfriend and many other colourful and amusing characters. Some of the lines said by these characters are priceless; stupid, but not overly stupid and you really could imagine people like these saying things like the characters in this film do.The entire cast of this movie excels; it features a lot of small characters and each one plays their part to perfection. The main acting plaudits come for Kirsten Dunst in the starring role of Amber Atkins. Kirsten has the ability to act, and act well and she's also extremely good looking. Many actresses look good and can't act, or vice versa but Kirsten has both abilities, which makes her a very good lady to have in your film. With a few more hits under her belt; Kirsten may well be remembered as the finest actress of her generation. Two other stand out performances come from Kirstie Alley as the former winner of the pageant and mother of one of the contestants; and Ellen Barkin, who brings the characters of Amber's mother to life brilliantly.Drop Dead Gorgeous is a film that will be overlooked by many because it's a teen comedy. This is a great injustice; here we have a film that is extremely funny, well acted and actually has something to say.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
14,Smells_Like_Cheese,Creepy,7,20 May 2004,"I know this sounds weird, but this movie creeped me out. I have a friend who's parent was very much like Kirstie Allen's character. So, it was just disturbing to see a parent act like that again.The movie is very funny, and has a cute story line. Kirsten Dunst and Denise Richards make the perfect cat fight duo. I'm guessing some guys must have gotten something out of this movie. :D Kirstie Allen is a great actress and really brought a lot to the movie. She shows how much parents can get obsessed with their children trying to make them into someone. I would recommend the film to anyone.

17,bowmanblue,An underrated classic,8,14 January 2015,"Drop Dead Gorgeous is filmed in a documentary style (no, thankfully not like the Blair Witch Project, or any of its many imitators) and charts a beauty pageant in small town America.If you're expecting just some simply bitchiness between catty teenage queens, you're probably thinking too low. Kirsty Alley plays the mother of one of the contestants who's determined to do whatever it takes for her daughter (Denise Richards) to win. This, of course, means murdering anyone who she sees as competition.Drop Dead Gorgeous is the epitome of black comedy. There are no jokes - as such - in this film. All the laughter comes from subtle situations and performances which leaves you cringing into your cushion. Also, all the characters are perfect. It's like an ensemble cast of actors and actresses that you probably don't know that well, who all just so happen to play their respected parts perfectly. Special credit must go to Denise Richards who is truly brilliant when she comes to visit the former beauty queen winner in hospital (I'll say no more about that - just classic).Perhaps Drop Dead Gorgeous didn't set the box office alight at its time of release because of its dark subject matter. It does poke fun of America's obsession with parades, self image and all things beautiful. It may even have been a little ahead of its time. Back in 1999 at the film's release, documentary (or should I say 'mockumentary' films?) were not as common as they are today.If you like your films deeply dark, with plenty of subtle humour and great performances then this is the one for you. However, if you're looking for comedy that's a little more 'in your face' (ala American Pie) then Drop Dead Gorgeous is a very different beast indeed).",Drop Dead Gorgeous
18,cricketbat,An entertaining mockumentary,6,22 August 2018,An entertaining mockumentary with a murder/mystery twist. Drop Dead Gorgeous is also a fun parody of Minnesota culture and beauty pageants. I had fun watching it.,Drop Dead Gorgeous
19,MBunge,A satire about beauty pageants even straight guys can enjoy,7,25 February 2011,"Drop Dead Gorgeous is an incorrigible satire that overcomes the doomed reputation of its genre to be one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time. Even when it's well done, satire tends to be more clever than comedicand it usually isn't that well done in the first place. This movie spectacularly succeeds by not only offering up sharp takes on fairly obvious and easy targets, but also delivering delightful bits of lunacy that will make you laugh at everything from horrific eating disorders to physical mutilation.The story is about a documentary film crew that goes to the small Minnesota town of Mount Rose to cover the local qualifying pageant for the America's Teen Princess competition. They film and interview the pageant organizers, young contestants and their friends and family. The crew is also around to record the deaths and maimings that surround the pageant and always seem to benefit Becky Leeman (Denise Richards), the jaded and two-faced daughter of Gladys Leeman (Kirstie Alley), the pageant organizer, a former pageant winner and a stage mom desperate to relive her past glory. The only real competitor to Becky, at least the only one that luckily remains unharmed, is Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst). She's the good hearted trailer park girl who squeezes in tap dancing practice during her two jobs, one in the school cafeteria and the other putting make up on stiffs in the town funeral parlor.As you might expect, a lot of the satire of Drop Dead Gorgeous is aimed at the natives of Minnesota and the classic tropes of small town life. It's reflected best in some of the pageant contestants. There's the slutty cheerleader (Amy Adams), the drama club chick (Laurie Sinclair), the tomboy of ambiguous sexuality (Brooke Bushman) and the fat girl who loves her dog a little too much (Shannon Nelson). But these filmmakers then compliment those fairly obvious characters with some wonderfully off kilter contestants. One young woman is a future fag hag (Brittany Murphy), another lives her life as a tribute to her deaf mother (Sarah Stewart) and another is a white girl adopted and raised by Japanese parents that are pathetically desperate to assimilate into the good ol' U S of A.By adding bizarre and outrageous bits that are only trying to make you laugh, it makes the satiric and darker outlook of the film go down a lot smoother. Many satires fall into the trap of being self righteous or exploitative but because there's a different and separate layer of comedy running through the story, Drop Dead Gorgeous is just plain hilarious. As you react to the crazy, non-satiric jokes, it becomes easier to appreciate the humor underlying the satire. And since the non-satiric comedy is more over-the-top and potentially offensive than the satiric moments, it never feels like the film is being judgmental about these characters or their dreams.Helping things out is a cast that's as good as the material they're given to work with. Kirsten Dunst and Amy Adams are the highlights, both absolutely adorable and just close enough to being realistic to give their characters that extra oomph. Ellen Barkin is also great as Amber's ""rode hard and put away wet"" mother and Allison Janney almost steals the show as her outspoken and cougarish trailer park neighbor. The other actors are also very funny and screenwriter Lona Williams gives one of the best performances in the movie without saying a word. Denise Richards iswell, she's Denise Richards. If you've seen her in other films, you know what to expect. She's good looking and makes an effort, but there's just not a lot going on.Drop Dead Gorgeous is a movie about teenage beauty pageants that's so funny and bold, even a lot of high school boys could enjoy itand I'm talking about heterosexual high school boys. I'm not sure there's any higher praise that I can give.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
20,Boyo-2,Mostly unfunny,3,5 July 2000,"Aside from a good performance by Alison Janney, this movie is worthless.  I could not believe any of the reviews I read praising this movie because I thought it reeked. One minute its a satire, one minute its black comedy, one minute its slapstick, and the whole mix is not successful.  Some of the comedy is insulting, to be honest, especially if you're sensitive to such things.  Death and prejudice are issues too big to be tackled by such a movie.  Lastly, Denise Richards and Kirstie Alley make a great mother-daughter tag-team - they are both so ridiculous that they obviously belong in the same family.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
21,onepotato2,ouch (chuckle...),5,3 June 2006,"I have some fondness for this movie, but it's like black comedy with the training wheels on. For every couple of bitter, on-the-mark scenes that have you laughing in astonishment, there's one that attempts the same and fails awkwardly. I'm a complete atheist but Denise Richards dance with Christ (on the crucifix) probably is funnier on paper than as performed. Maybe it's Richards herself that's the problem. She pretty much manages to ruin everything she's in. (Spoiler) Kirsten Dunst working at her morticians job, unexpectedly unveiling her boyfriend when hunting season starts isn't funny, it's a shocking, deeply painful moment that just elicited a wince from me.But again there's some great laughs: The sausage beauty-queen segment. The beer can fused to Ellin Barkins hand.

22,aimless-46,Extremely Subversive,9,12 January 2007,"Imagine a weird blend of ""This Is Spinal Tap"" and ""Fargo"" and you will have a fairly good read on 1999's ""Drop Dead Gorgeous. There is definitely a Coen Brothers feel to the film, which is done in ""mockumentary"" style and told from the point of view of a film crew investigating the world of local beauty pageants; specifically the Miss Teen Princess contest in Mount Rose, Minnesota.But it would be a mistake to think that this is just a satire of the beauty pageant world or of folks from Minnesota. The film has much bigger targets, as it pretty much takes on every excess to be found in the competitive culture of modern American. Making it the most subversive comedy since ""Dr. Strangelove"". It may not have the consistency of Kubrick's masterpiece, but it has a slightly higher comic hit to miss ratio than ""Airplane"".Former Miss Teen Princess Gladys Leeman (Kirstie Alley) is in charge of the Mount Rose preliminary, a conflict of interest because her daughter Becky (Denise Richards) (a younger version of her mercenary mother) is a leading contender. After murdering her daughter's only real competition, Gladys targets trailer-park girl Amber (Kirsten Dunst), who hopes to use the contest as a means to follow in the footsteps of her idol Diane Sawyer.There are so many different types of humor in ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" that almost any viewer will find something amusing. But the degree of amusement will be in direct proportion to your degree of irreverence and ""nothing sacred"" attitudes. So if you are easily offended or are sense of humor challenged you would do well to stay away from this film. I particularly liked the contestant's dramatic reading from ""Soylent Green"", and Britney Murphy's line about being conceived because her parents wanted someone who could donate a kidney to her older brother. Although she only has a small part, Murphy pretty much steals every scene in which she appears. The three big parts (Alley, Richards, and Dunst) are played straight (or with parodied straightness) so most of the comedy comes from the supporting cast; most notably Allison Janney as a trailer park neighbor, Will Sasso as a mentally challenged small businessman, Seiko Matsudo as the resentful biological daughter of an Asian couple who dotes on their adopted Caucasian daughter, and Matt Malloy as a contest judge with a not so secret agenda.Then again, what do I know?

The film works as a documentary and explores many social town's aspects, making some funny jokes involving irony and sarcasm that really works. Sometimes the characters seem to be unintentionally funny, but of course that's the purpose of the writers-- make them look as if they weren't trying to be funny. ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" is apparently a good choice for all ages, since anyone can understand the simple jokes and critics they make throughout the fast 97 minutes.

The girls that participate in it all believe that they are the only ones that deserve to win and their supporters, with their parents on top, are convinced that their girl is the next miracle on two legs.

They use some standard situations, magnify them by a factor of 1000 and then aim at them with a large cannon so they certainly will not miss their target. Does that mean that the humor isn't any good? No, certainly not. It's sometimes so over-the-top that you will almost certainly have to laugh with it, but it's just not the kind of movie for the people who only like very 'intelligent' comedies. And even though the idea of a 'mockumentary' isn't new, it is done quite well in this movie and in a more or less original way. They make fun of the contestants and their fans in this movie, but don't really spare the TV-crews either. They make for instance fun of their eternal drift to sensation and spectacular news items.In the end this is a nice comedy that may perhaps not be liked by everybody, but that certainly offered some good performances by all the actors. They made the many funny characters look even more ridiculous as what they are in real life (and that's certainly not always easy). The story was good and the entire movie really could have been a lot worse. I liked what I saw and I give this movie a 7/10, maybe even a 7.5/10.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
25,bkrauser-81-311064,"In This Case, I Would Try the Lutefisk",10,18 February 2012,"The quaint tales from Lake Wobegon have nothing on this pitch black fable from Mt Rose's, Miss Teen Princess Pageant. Captured by a supposed documentary film crew over a course of a few weeks, ""Drop Dead Gorgeous's"" biting satire and gallows humor hits you like a malfunctioning stage light to the head.Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst) is a modest teenager with the modest goal of performing her dance routine in front of her mother (Ellen Barkin) who was a former beauty queen. Amber's other idol, Dianne Sawyer was also a beauty pageant winner so it only makes sense she's in it to win it. Her chances of taking home the prize however are dimmed at every turn by town rich girl Becky Leeman (Denise Richards) and her overbearing, duplicitous mother, (Kristie Alley) who is also the pageant organizer. As ""accidents"" start to occur and bodies start to pile up around town it is clear something's rotten in the State of Minnesota.You might gleam that this film pokes a lot of fun at beauty pageants. Well, you'd be right but small town America gets by far the largest skewering as evidenced not only with the exaggerated Midwestern accents and trailer park foolishness but the corruption of the pageant itself. Each character, even the background ones leave an indelible mark, showcasing a parade of farcical character traits and neurosis topped only by their particular ""talents"". They are of course oblivious to their own faults allowing the film crew to edit their doc with levels upon levels of delicious irony.People who deride this film because it doesn't rise to the level of ""Waiting for Guffman"" are making a false comparison. ""Guffman"" uses the mockumentary style as its own genre. The humor stems not from anarchic comedy or exaggerated satire but from the human elements captured' on film. Christopher Guest's characters are more three-dimensional and as a result the satire culminates in warm lighthearted jabs. ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" on the other hand is a dark comedy with the mockumentary style serving only as a gimmick. The style isn't fundamentally important to the themes like in ""Guffman"" yet important to amplify a few key gags.And boy are these gags effective! Nearly every joke hits it mark. Due credit should be given to scribe Lona Williams who also penned and story edited much of the Drew Carrey Show. But I reserve my largest accolades to the cast. Not only do Dunst, Barkin, and Alley deliver but so does the supporting cast which includes Allison Janney Brittany Murphy, Amy Adams, Mindy Sterling and even walk-ons by Adam West and the always funny Nora Dunn.In conclusion, for those who like their satire cold and black, and those who can appreciate a largely female cast ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" maybe just the shot in the arm you need.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",Drop Dead Gorgeous

It's wonderfully scripted and directed, and the cast is simply perfect; everyone in it appears to be relishing the humour in the movie and it shows in their performances.If you like this kind of humour, you will love this, if you don't warm to black comedy then it's best left alone.8/10 Personally i think its great.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

28,baumer,What a stupid movie,2,25 July 1999,"Okay, so let's get this straight.  The producers of this movie thought that it would be funny because it had some attempted Something About Mary humour in it.  They had parts that tried to offend everyone from Jewish people to Japanese people, deaf and the gay and of course the mentally challenged fat guy.  So the producers of this did the same thing that the producers of A Midnight Summers Dream did.  They started counting the money before the film was ever made.  They thought a film that relies on similarities of a previous film was something that would work regardless of how stupid of an idea it was.  Something About Mary was funny because it was crude, yes, but it was also funny because it had a story and not just jokes stuck in the film for shock value.  Drop Dead Gorgeous is a terrible film and how it ever got past the boardroom is beyond me.  It is occassionally humourous, I'll give it that, but how hard is it to write humour when you are Xeroxing what made another film funny?  But as we all know, when making a copy of something, the copy always comes out worse than the original.  Drop Dead Gorgeous is in a class by itself for terrible movies and terrible photocopies.  Let's start off first by looking at what is such a blatant rip off that it was painful watching it, and that was the mentally challenged fat guy.  This guy might as well have been a brother of Cameron Diaz's from Something About Mary.  But here he was thrown in for effect.  He was thrown in simply for comic relief because they knew they didn't have any humour in the film.  But what made the same character work in Mary was that he was a part of the film, he was a part of who her character was.  He wasn't just a sideshow.  Here he is.  There is absolutely no point for him in this film except for us to laugh at his stupidity.  If he wasn't in the film it wouldn't be any better or any worse.  He is just there to be there.  Nothing more and nothing less.  If you see the film, ask yourself why it was necessary to have him.  There are also silly caricatures of Orientals in this movie.  Again, what was the point?  And to have 90% of the film done documentary style was just annoying.  I of course can see what they were trying to do in the film, and that is to show how pathetic some people can get when it comes to their kids and competing.  It also tries to portray small town America as silly trailer trash that have nothing better to do than drink their lives away so that when one has an accident, a beer can is molded to her hand.  I honestly can't believe how bad this movie is.  It is so bad!What I did like about it ( and this is the only thing ) was Kirsten Dunst. She is way too good to be in a movie like this.  Her energy is contagious and at one point late in the film I almost started enjoying it.  But that was almost.  Even Dunst's energy, charm and sweet smile can't save this awful picture.  This is one of those movies that makes me mad.  Mad that a film like this can be made when there has to be some struggling young person out there that has a brilliant idea and no way of getting in the door.  And then they see garbage like this and it must make their skin crawl.  It's strange, this summer has generally been a good summer for films.  Star Wars, American Pie and Big Daddy have been good entertainment, but then I have also seen three of the worst films I have seen in quite some time, that being Wild Wild West, The Haunting and now this.  What a bummer.  What a waste of ten bucks.  Maybe what Hollywood producers should do is exactly what Apollo Creed did in the first Rocky.  Find some unknown guy with a script and pay him scale and then film his story.  It would have to be better than this piece of trash.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

33,Movie-12,Not funny enough--contains one of the worst point of views ever! *1/2 out of ****,4,12 September 1999,"DROP DEAD GORGEOUS (1999) *1/2Starring: Kirsten Dunst, Ellen Barkin, Kirstie Alley, Denise Richards, and Allison Janney Director: Michael Patrick Jann   97 minutes   Rated PG-13 (for language, crude humor, sex-related material and violence) By Blake French:	You gotta hand it to ""Drop Dead Gorgeous,"" it may have one of  the most ineffective point of views in movie history, but some of its humor is enough to drive one into a wither. Now, about that point of view: The movie is set up as a mockumentary, a movie, like ""The Blair Witch Project"" that is always seen through the eyes of some stranger recording the film's characters every move. Instead of getting to know the characters, we're stuck with watching irrelevant interviews the documentary crew shoots. When character development is needed, the movie's style is quickly changed in order to fit the occupying scene, and in many cases, it develops the competition that this movie requires. Instead of inducing audience participation, the filmmakers chose to use an inconsistent and repulsive way to explore this movie's story, which in itself is almost a sure flop, although original elements are present.  	The plot: A small documentary crew is set out to shot a movie on a minor Minnesota teen beauty pageant that has been a tradition in the town for years. But instead of investigating the documentary crew, exactly how ""The Blair Witch Project"" succeeded, the filmmakers focus on the pageant contestants. We first meet the past winner who lives in a hospital because of her sever eating disorder. A kind contender running for this year's prize, Amber Atkins, helps by brushing her hair, which falls out with very pull. The girl explains to Amber that the way she became beauty queen is running many miles a day with only a few hundred calories. Later on throughout the production, this anorexic character is used for even more effective laughs. 	Competition is soon red hot between the pageant organizer, Gladys Leeman, and her daughter's success, who is a rebellious Denise Richards as Becky Leeman. The contestants who seem to have a pretty good chance at winning are dropping like flies. One blows up while driving a tractor. Another is killed when a stage light drops on their head during rehearsal. Even Amber discovers her life is in danger when first her boyfriend appears at her after school job (the morgue) with a bullet between the eyes and a note that reads ""you're next"" on him, and the her trailer home blows up with her mother in it. She survives but must live as a handicap for the rest of her life.	We have already established that structurally this movie fails. Also to its certain demise, the characters are too very week in motivation. The main antagonist is eliminated 2/3 of the way though, leaving only the film's presence of high energy to carry itself though the end. Although the characters are well cast and acted, they make such a big deal about such small things that it is a strain to laugh even when the film offers funny moments. Most of them do offer a laugh of two along the way, especially an outgoing joke that details the pageant judges, but even that it milked for all that it could be. You see, even though some of the humor does work, lets face it, there is only so far this material can be stretched.
	I don't know what happened in the last thirty minutes of this film, but they were wonderfully inspirational and funny. This is especially true for a particular scene in which the pageant contestants compete during a rehearsal styled ""Fitness USA."" And another as the anorexic girl surrenders her crown as she dances to a final song she sings. Lets not forget she is in a wheelchair. So here's my recommendation: go to the multiplex, see another movie, walk out of that theater about half way though, and walk into this one during its last thirty minutes. That way, ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" can live up to its script. 				 	Brought to you by New Line Cinema.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
34,alice liddell,"Lousy satire, funny comedy.",6,6 October 1999,"DROP DEAD GORGEOUS is the latest in the long line of films influenced, both in terms of style and subject matter, by smart animation (e.g. RUSHMORE, ELECTION); here leavened with a dose of Michael Ritchie.  Indeed, it plays like an extended episode of SOUTH PARK.  Like that work of once-genius, it concerns the foibles, self-destructive eccentricity and ludicrious ambitions of small-town life, filmed in a - yawn - documentary stylee, an inverse BLAIR WITCH if you will.  All the characters are cartoons, so we don't care what happens to them, and there are many satisfyingly harmless acts of gratuitous violence.Of course, it's not really like SOUTH PARK at all.  That show's nihilistic contempt channelled into childish destructiveness is absent here.  You see, GORGEOUS wants to Make Points, fatal for any would-be satirical film.  One of the problems is that the satire is remarkably laboured and obvious. Every 'irony' is telegraphed ten miles off.  American moms are ambitious! 'Murderously' ambitious!  American fathers are spineless wimps!  (although the fact that he looks the spit of Bill Clinton is pointedly amusing)  The American Dream (yes!  that old chestnut!) favours ruthless individuality over community and ethics!  American gun laws are idiotic and dangerous! The cult of beauty leads to anorexia, dysfunction and unhappiness!  YOU! DON'T! SAY!  SERIAL MOM is a much sharper, richer satire with some of these themes.What is most offensive about the film is how, like HEATHERS,  it is desperate to be seen as sassy, sharp and subversive, and yet underneath offers the same old Hollywood teen tripe.  A supposed satire on suffocating small town life, the American way of life, or the ethics of documentary, is reduced to another teen movie about a nice, hard-working, plain (okay, maybe not so plain), decent girl, and a spoiled, rich, preening, gorgeous bitch. Guess who wins.  How she wins, though, is quite circuitous from the norm, shocking, and very funny.  There is a cheeky suggestion that the only way she succeeds is by benefitting from just the same 'accidents' as her nemesis.Finally, the treatment of the subject matter itself is problematic.  The film is about the build-up to a local beauty pageant, and, inevitably, there is the sight of very beautiful young ladies doing nubile, excitable things. A paedophile is prominently placed to distance us from this position, but, as he points out, what he's doing is no different from what the documentary crew, and, by implication, we the viewers, are doing.  This might be radical self-reflexivity, or it might be gutless self-serving: a having of our ethical cake, and lecherously eating it.But that's enough carping.  What's most important is that the film is very entertaining, from its shameless title-pun theft from a rubbish Tony Curtisfarce, to a wonderfully drawn mix of characters and caricatures, random violence, hysterical set pieces and priceless lines.  Things pick up immeasurably as the pageant nears, and you begin to forgive the film its flaws.  The scene where Denise Richards serenades a model Christ is a jawdropping comic standout.The documentary framework, irritating at first, is nicely worked out, with asides on objectivity and interference, especially at the end, when the crew meet their buddies from COPS.  The performances are very likeable, even Kirstin Dunst in a drippy role, but Richards is a howl, and hopefully won't be stuck in a career rut of just looking gorgeous.  The film goes on way to long after the hysterically funny swan demise, but GORGEOUS is great fun.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

It's a shame such a fate befell Drop Dead Gorgeous, a dark, funny and genuinely clever lampooning of the beauty queen pageant done as mockumentary.Drop Dead Gorgeous focuses on a film crew who are making a documentary about a local beauty pageant, interviewing all of the contestants and event organizer Gladys (Kirstie Alley) a former pageant winner who's daughter Rebecca (Denise Richards) is entering this year's pageant. Two things quickly become obvious: that ill fortune is befalling many of the entrants and the only serious contenders and Rebecca and girl-next-door Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst). Amber comes from a trailer trash family (Ellen Barkin plays her mother), and works making up dead bodies at the local funeral home. A young Brittany Murphy and Amy Adams also star.The film is well written, finding a good blend of darkness and humour and always keeping a light tone, which is the key to the film's charm. Some scenes verge on being brilliant and the performances, particularly Kirstie Alley, are all first rate.While the film can be enjoyed on multiple viewings, it's not really the type you watch over and over, which also would have counted against it as an appealing VHS purchase.Fun, dark and well made, Drop Dead Gorgeous is well worth tracking down.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

A documentary film crew sets out to follow the contestants and their parents, in what is to be another mockumentary in the vein of great spoofs like 'Waiting for Gufman', 'This is Spinal Tap', and 'Best in Show'. Unfortunately it never makes the mark.While the actors/actresses are great, the film is really just a bunch of running gags.  The whole thing just turns out unbelievable and that's its fault.  The success of the other mockumentaries is that you are convinced that what you are seeing is REAL and REAL people, but in Drop Dead Gorgeous constant gags and humorous puns occur over and over again in what seems to be an attempt at trying too hard and it doesn't seem believable.  In the end it doesn't pay off.  Its as if the director just decided that everyone should try to speak like all the characters in 'Fargo' and it would work.It's a shame though because the players do well, the material seems workable (teen pageants are an obvious gold mine for comedic writing), and there were scenes that I found gut bustingly funny, but it became like nothing more than one of those SNL skits that runs on too long way after the punch line has been done.

Obviously it was well-publicized when it first came out, but it was sort of hit and miss at the theater, and only a select group of people did and still do like it.It's the sort of movie most people will either love or hate, and I for one love it! It's a stupid comedy, that has just enough stupidity, but certainly enough actual humor in it, to make it funny. The entire film is well filmed, as if it were a documentary. There are several jokes that you will either get or not get, and if you don't get them, then the movie will only get worse for you. Denise Richards is someone that I don't particularly care for, simply because I don't really think of her as much of an actress. She's really good at playing the conceded beauty Queen, which is what she plays in this as well. However, she does do it believably, and that's what her character was. Kirsten Dunst is my favorite in the film, and I love her accent! Everyone who actually tried to do the Minnesotan accent was excellent, very believable and very funny. Kirsty Ally was exceptionally good in the role, and the best actress in the whole movie, was Ellen Barkin, who played Kirsten Dunst's mom. She was outstanding, but then, we are talking about Ellen Barkin, who is one of the most underrated actress of our time, and one of the most talented.I give it a ten, because it is one of my all time favorites, and I can't believe more people don't love it just as much.

I could find many people getting offended because this film mows down a pretty wide swath of group in its jokes.  But for someone who is not in any of the group the movie is poking fun at, or who could take a joke, this film is pretty funny, even though many of the jokes are very crass.There is no subtlety in this movie, everything is over the top, or at least near it.  It also has a lot of the behind the scenes on what goes on in the pagentry, and the life of many of the people who enters it.  The film seems to be written by someone who is an insider and is writing a script to get back or poke fun at the whole pagent business.As a whole, it is a no holds barred satirical/black comedy mockumentry, albeit slightly crude and obtuse sometimes.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

54,Captain Ed,"Dreck, absolute dreck, uff da",3,27 June 2000,"I just cannot believe how insipid this supposedly cutting social satire actually is.  This film is as subtle as a sledgehammer, and the shame of it is that the concept is great.First, it took me two tries to get through the first five minutes.  I don't know what the producers were trying to say by setting this movie in Minnesota -- I recently moved here from Southern California, so I have some suspicions -- but they could have at least hired a dialect coach.  Didn't they check with the Coen Brothers?  Kirstie Alley's accent was just atrocious, and Kirsten Dunst's was about as consistent as Kevin Costner's English accent in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.  Denise Richards didn't even bother with one (good for her), and the rest of the cast had either non-existent or ridiculous accents.** SOME SPOILERS INCLUDED **And if that was all that was wrong with the movie, it would still be watchable.  However, the acting was as bad as the accents and the script was even worse.  Hands for everyone who guessed the float would explode as soon as the antagonist says, ""It smells like gasoline""?  How about those who knew that their would be a massive food poisoning outbreak as soon as Dunst said that she didn't eat shellfish?  And how many thought that the poison twist was just a trite way for the writers to unbox themselves from a very lengthy movie?  At the 90-minute mark it seems fishy indeed.  And if you pay attention to the very end, you'll hear people scream just BEFORE the reporter gets it.Also, there are some very unfunny and offensive shots taken at handicapped people, both physically and mentally.  Ellen Barkin's attempt to open a beer can with a prosthetic arm was just stupid, and the whole Hank character served no purpose other than ""let's laugh at the retard"" -- and if you think that it's not PC to use that term, the movie uses it several times from several different characters, even some of the sympathetic ones.Dunst wasn't bad (except for the accent), and Richards was pretty good, but almost everyone else in this movie stinks it up.  Honorable mention for Worst Actress was a tie between the two 'state board' officials at the Puke Pageant.  These two were the pits in a movie straining to bottom out.

55,copperncherrio,Surprisingly Outstanding Satire,9,30 September 2010,"The Minnesota accent is fantastic and the details to humor is just brilliant. Granted not everyone in Minnesota sounds like that, but it is a far more of an accurate accent than the strong one in Fargo. It's fair to say this because I actually live 30 minutes from Minnesota. There's just so much going on in the background and as silly as everything is, you are really rooting for Dunst's character, even though the tone is so ""Strictly Ballroom"" (outrageous and sweet). The documentary style is perfect for this it brings out the charm and ugliness of the whole story.Honestly, I'm just surprised that this movie wasn't and isn't more popular.

I don't know if it was the exaggerated mid-western accents or the dialogue itself at times.  But as a farce on small towns and local beauty pageants you can't help but laugh at the heights of absurdity that this movie climbs too.The cast itself must be given immense credit for being able to perform with those accents and look serious at the same time.  I will bet there were many takes where no one in this cast or crew could keep a straight face. Considering the materials they were given to work with their performances were, in my opinion, excellent.  But still, that can only go so far, when a movie needs some kind of real help.The movie is campy, offensive to mid-westerners with no sense of humor, and at times painful to watch.

I did like the girl who took the place of Kirsten Dunst when she tapped dance(no, that really wasn't her. If you look on the credits it will tell you the girl who really did the tap dancing.)

I don't know much at all about it, and I found myself cringing more than laughing. There were some good moments, but they sank under the weight of too many ham-handed ""laugh at this stereotype"" ones. This person loves Jesus! Ha! Ha! How funny! Wait, she's using Jesus' name as a swear word! She's a hypocrite! What a knee-slapper! Hey, this guy is a pervert! Ha! Haha! Oh that's hilarious! The problem is that most of these things aren't funny at all, at least on their own. Again, maybe knowing Minnesota better would bring out the humor, but if that's the case then this is a giant ""in joke"", and I'll provide the warning for those who aren't ""in"" to probably just skip this movie.The last 15 minutes didn't feel like they fit; the story felt like it should end with the contest we were following for all of the first 4/5 of the movie. After that I wasn't sure where we were going, or why. The movie's focus seemed to change from the original contest to the contest winner. Either redo the first 4/5 of the movie to make it focus on her, or else lose the last bit so the focus stays on the contest.Also, why did Kirstie Alley's character do what she did in the parade? Her comments both before and after indicate that she knew what was going to happen when she did it, so...!?! That bit just made no sense.I did really like Ellen Barkin and Allison Janney. They did a lot with the material they were given. Most of the other characters... again, I guess I just didn't get it.3/10: 1 for a few laughs, 1 for Ellen & Allison, and 1 for the eye candy, Amy Adams and Denise Richards in particular -- and am I getting old or can I throw Ellen in there too?

59,poem,Wonderfully wicked - fall in love to Kirsten Dunst,10,2 November 1999,"Another true masterpiece with Kirsten Dunst. Her last one, Strike, is still my absolute favorite of 1999 (but for americans, its a movie of 1998).Unlike almost any other movie, this one isn't filmed using an absolute standpoint, but is designed as if it's a ""real"" documentation of a camera team, plus some material filmed by other camera teams, and by the police. I liked this style very much, it added magic and realism to the movie, including the fact that the camera people became actors when they interviewed the actors or talked with another camera team, and the actors, if they recognize the camera, interact with it.It's basic story is about a beauty competition where some girls are too ambitious and use every weapon they could get, including murder. This sounded boring in my ears, I only watched the movie because of the stars (I simply trust people which made good movies in the past), and was of course very happy about that afterwards, because, as I already stated, this is an absolute masterpiece, with perfect acting, one wonderful scene after the other, full of black humor, full of parodies about the typical craziness of americans (for example, their love to weapons), full of especially crazy americans and last not least - prepare to watch the ugliest, most abnormal, kinkiest, most one-dimensional Denise Richards you're ever seen, and also the most intelligent, most gorgeous angel called Kirsten Dunst you can imagine. Or even can't. In complete harmony with their roles. Whow ! That's art, that's acting ! During the later movie, you would take any oath that Miss Dunst is the most beautiful woman of the world, even if you're not one of those people which would swear that at any time (I wouldn't).If you hated movies such as ""There's something about Mary"" or ""The opposite of sex"", don't watch this one.

62,thescholar22,A Little Jab at competitions and how people CAN be over-competitive.,7,30 October 2019,"Thought about this movie from 1999 for a few weeks now since the main plot feels kind of true for reality tv, contests, and game shows today at times. I'll tell you a bit later in this review and you'll know what I'm saying. This movie is a black comedy mockumentary about this Minnesota town and it's high school Beauty pageant it's going to have. Only a handful show up and along the way someone tries to kill off the contestants one by one.One of the contestants is a young Kirsten Dunst before the Spider-man movies. Another is this anorexic girl from last years contest in some hospitals eating disorders ward. People in this movie keeps saying if they're on Cops which is a bit of a joke in the end. Near the end when it's found out who was killing all these girls it's a bit shocking. Then there's the pageant State finals and most of the contestants get food poisoning and there's this big scene of all the other contestants throwing up. Kirstin Dunst ends up winning since she didn't eat the food there.At the end where the winners of this pageant go to this make up place that promoted the beauty pageant. Sadly the make up place was shut down after problems with tax evasion around the time of the documentary, permanently. Then all the other contestants go crazy and attack the building but Kirstin Dunst just gets back on the bus, showing self control and being calm through it all. Then the movie explains what happened to the runner up in the pageant, the killer, and Kirstin Dunst, then it ends.What really gets me is not only the dark humor, how overly competitive people can be, and it's also PG-13. The story also felt a bit realistic since a lot of people in these contests, reality tv, and even game shows can be overly competitive even though it's just a contest. They have other accomplishments and stuff to fall back on if they lose this and it isn't important. You can give this a watch on Hulu since it popped up recently and is considered to have a cult following.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

64,Rhino Rover,Not that good.,3,23 July 1999,"I had the opportunity to go to the preview for this movie about two weeks ago and afterwards, wished that I had the chance to turn back time and get that 2 hours of my life back.The basic plot line is about a teen beauty pageant in a small 'redneck' town. This alone should have been warning enough to me but I went to the movie anyway. The movie films from the perspective of a TV company brought in to document the pageant. Throughout the pageant, the different contestants are interviewed to find out a little about each of them. As the movie progresses, pageant members 'mysteriously' die or get injured (although it's not too hard to figure out who the culprit(s) could be). The pageant basically boils down to two contestants, one of which is the pageant organizers 'perfect' (Richards) daughter and the other, a poor 'cinderella' type character. The movie follows the toilet humor of the other summer movies (Austin Powers, American Pie, Big Daddy) but I found it to be pointless and poorly written. The acting was mediocre and towards the end I just wanted the movie to end. Shock humor is used almost exclusively but unlike American Pie, I found it to be crass, and more importantly, frequently completely pointless to the movie. At least in AP, it was relevant to the story. In this movie, it seemed that some of it was put in just for the shock value and hopefully generate a laugh. Now, I do have to admit that some of it was humorous (most of it revolved around the hardware store owner and his mentally handicapped son) but it was not very frequent. The ending was definately rushed. It almost seemed like the director had gotten to a certain point in making the movie and gotten bored with making the film and just wrapped everything up.One final note, if Denise Richards ever wants to be taken seriously, she should start choosing her roles more carefully. Right now, she seems like an actor that is getting roles purely for her looks.Overall, I would hesitate recommending this movie. If you do want to see it, go as a matinee or on cheap night. You'll probably agree after seeing it that you could have spent your evening doing something better. If you want to see a toilet humor movie then go see American Pie.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

70,Parks,Good Bad Taste,7,27 September 1999,"Welcome to the town of Mount Rose, Minnesota (""Home of the oldest living Lutheran"").  The folks there are just about ready to crown the 50th Annual American Teen Princess.  And since this is such an auspicious occasion, a documentary crew has been dispatched to film the whole thing! The crew interview last year's winner (from the Eating Disorders wing of the local hospital) and some of the judges (""Yep, I'm just here watching the young girls - er - contestants - and - yeah - I brought a video camera. What are you suggesting?  Did you hear something about me???"") This year's theme is ""Proud to Be an American"" (previous themes include ""USA - A-OK!"" and ""Amer-I-CAN!"") and is organised by Gladys Leeman.  So it seems her daughter Becky has a pretty good chance of walking away with the title. Especially since her rivals consist of girls like the one who's mad about dogs (""My last dog is on a farm now, with a nice family, after he attacked me"") and the girl who sees the competition as a means of escape from the town.  (""Boys have so many more ways of getting out.  Like hockey school. Or prison""). But wait!  Here comes Amber Atkins, the white-trash, tap-dancing funeral parlour assistant.  Maybe Becky doesn't have this thing sewn up after all... However, rivals to Becky have a nasty habit of meeting with accidents, and Amber begins to fear for her life... This is one of the most mean-spirited, nasty, evil and bitchy films I've seen in a while - full of girly infighting and exploding teens.  So it sums up the whole spirit of beauty pageants quite well. It's the sort of film John Waters used to make before he lost it completely. It's like Heathers meets South Park.

Having never seen it in the theatre, I watched.  I was surprised at how bitingly funny it was, and how there were very few bad performances in the entire film.  I don't know why I hadn't watched it earlier, especially living in Minnesota as I do.In the small town of Mount Rose, Minnesota, there is an annual beauty contest: the Sarah Rose Cosmetics American Teen Princess Pageant.  The film follows, in a kind-of mockumentary fashion, the nine girls competing in the contest.  The two main competitors are Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst), an honest trailer-park denizen with dreams of being the next Diane Sawyer, and Rebcca Leeman (Denise Richards), a spoiled brat of a teenager with only the most technical definition of talent.  The contest is made that much more complicated by the fact that Rebecca's mother (Kirstie Alley) is the head of the pageant committee and was once crowned Mount Rose Teen Princess herself. There are deaths and explosions and a catfight or two, as well as your daily recommended dose of self-righteous Lutherans, Minnesota accents, and pedophiles.Much of the comedy in the film is dark, and some of it could easily be construed as mean-spirited, especially if you're a Lutheran (there is no shortage of jibes at the prevalence of the conservative Lutheran mindset so commonplace in small-town Minnesota).  Kirsten Dunst is always fantastic, and Ellen Barkin is winningly low-brow as her mother.  Kirstie Alley is even funnier here than in her psychotic Pier 1 Imports commercials, and Denise Richards is perfectly cast as the marginally-beautiful and personality-deprived princess of Mount Rose (this girl doesn't get acting jobs based on talent).  Brittany Murphy, as a fellow contestant, and Allison Janey, as the best friend of Amber's mother, are also hilarious.  Watch for great cameo appearances by Mo Gaffney and Nora Dunn, as well.While the mockumentary approach falls apart about half-way through the film and some of the jokes are obvious two minutes before they happen, the film is very funny, with great comedic performances from many actresses not know for comedic roles.

77,davidholmesfr,The laughs come too cheap,6,7 February 2003,"Most forms of entertainment render themselves liable to satire when performances are made into a competition. The music world satirises itself with the annual Eurovision Song Contest, an event which has achieved almost cult status through its sheer awfulness. Competitive ballroom dancing was beautifully targeted in ""Strictly Ballroom"" and the teen beauty pageant has been dealt with in Michael Ritchie's ""Smile"".""Drop Dead Gorgeous"", in attempting a further shy at the teen pageant business, goes for an in-your-face, sledgehammer approach. It's a mix of slapstick and odd characters, most of whom suffer from problems such as anorexia, obesity, paranoia and mental retardation. Given this line-up the laughs are inevitably bought at very low cost. That's not to say that there aren't some really funny moments (Becky Leeman's grotesque performance with a stuffed Christ attached to the Cross is but one). But such genuine comedy moments occur only in patches. Once a couple of the ""bad"" characters are dealt with about two-thirds of the way through the rest of the film becomes a desperate search for the inevitable ending in which good must prevail over bad. Throughout all this the performance of Allison Janney shines out. She steals every scene she's in, portraying a character not a thousand miles removed from that of Joanna Lumley in TV's ""Absolutely Fabulous"".The laughs are there, but often only because the targets are so soft.

This film has some very funny moments, which could have been funnier had they not been handled in such a heavy handed fashion.Well cast and well acted the psuedo documentary style  did tend to pall after a while, but in many ways it was a more telling indictment on American  values than the much feted American Beauty. Of the excellent cast, Ellen Barkin stands out as the often zonked out mother of our heroine, who has us rooting for her right from the early scenes.What spoils the movie somewhat is its tendency to drag out some of the funny scenes and to really stretch the imagination that ANYONE could be as bad as some of the ""talent show"" acts were. The Denise Richards ""Jesus"" act was ridiculous, not funny (and I don't make this comment from religious bias)and I have to agree with other comments on the totally unnecessary scenes with the anorexic ""reigning queen"", once again not funny.Apart from these carps, I would recommend this movie as being much deeper in some ways than its subject matter suggests.

82,Empire-3,Entertaining,6,5 January 2002,"This movie was a surprise to me, because it was funny. It went straight to video in the country where I live. This movie should have had theatre premiere. Maybe it went straight to video, because this movie is quite small movie. But anyway the film had black comedy influences and it wasn't jusst your ordinary comedy. The movie was told in documentary style and it worked well. The performances were good and all the cast enjoyed playing their strange characters. Drop Dead Gorgeus isn't perfect movie and it has flaws, especially after when the first pageant in the movie is over; the movie becomes quite boring. (*** stars out of *****)",Drop Dead Gorgeous

I will just say it is one of those movies you can watch again and again to pick up additional subtleties you missed the previous times, like the original ""Airplane"" spoof.

You must, MUST blame the Director.  This is a terrible movie.  Yes, it has its ""laughing out loud"" moments, but by and large it is very poorly made, and not worth 90 minutes to catch the two or three funnies.The Director was shooting for a mockumentary, in the vein of THIS IS SPINAL TAP, or WAITING FOR GUFFMAN.  But the idiot did not think the audience would be attentive enough to notice his use of multiple cameras, or clean cinematography.  Second, a mockumentary must have a believable storyline.  DROP DEAD GORGEOUS was the furthest thing possible from believable.  It was a farce, more akin to AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON.  Now there is nothing wrong with a good farce! But just don't try to sell it as a mockumentary.And therein lies the answer.  Run, don't walk from this movie.

Several scenes are incredibly funny (but cannot be described here in order to avoid spoilers).The cast is great (and includes the marvelous Denise Richards as well as a bunch of Young great actresses)and the scenario follows its dark humor to the end of the movie.Definitively a movie to watch, especially if you are open minded and like deep irony and subtle but strong messages.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

Its a film I can go to when I'm feeling down and I know it'll lift my spirits.The whole beauty pageant thing isn't really a 'thing' in the UK so we tend to only see it via American TV and films etc. Drop Dead Gorgeous shines a hilariously dark light in proceedings with possibly corrupt judges, as well as contestants meeting their end as they get closer to the finals,Kirsten Dunst is perfect as the perky and ambitious underdog Amber Atkins, with Alison Janney playing her 'trailer park' neighbour with absolute relish. Kirstie Alley as the 'pushy mum' of one of the contestants is utterly hilarious as well as being completely horrific and a total psycho.The supporting cast of small town misfits all with their own reason for taking part in the Miss Teen America contest are well written, characterised and hilarious/tragic at the same time.Particular highlights are Becky Leeman dancing with a Jesus on a cross, as well as last year's winner now confined to a wheelchair and suffering with anorexia miming along to Melissa Manchester. Tasteless it may be but also incredibly funny.If you like your comedy slightly dark as well as satirising something long seen as part of the American Dream this film won't disappoint. Its almost consistently hilarious throughout, and even the slightly serious tone towards the end is lightened up with a few great comedy lines.This film was probably slightly before its time, but it has now come of age. Well worth watching and re-watching.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
92,Brap-2,A worthwhile experience of blinded America,9,12 February 2000,"The fact that the film was a fake-documentary (at least 95% of it) made so much sense of how a witch such as Kristie Alley's character can go to make her daughter win. I have seen such actions. HILARIOUS!The movie was too funny! Excellent screenplay! I laughed even after it was over. Sure, the ending was corny, but spontaneous. As a major movie-goer, I look for different theatrical creations. ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" proved to be one of them. Very creative and funny writing and directing.Sometimes, amateur camera work is the way to go. This movie showed it all.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
93,Jeannot,Delicious Deadly Satire,10,27 January 2001,"Very enjoyable, if you have any taste for satire.  The target is teen beauty pageants, and beyond that, small-town life, where such pageants are a BIG DEAL.This was an ensemble piece, with all hands performing admirably.  Everyone seemed to have the Minnesota Swedish accent down.  Especially noteworthy in this regard were Kirstie Alley and Kirsten Dunst. (After seeing THE VIRGIN SUICIDES, I can say that Ms Dunst is very talented)  The satire is somewhat broad but effective.  There are several laugh-out-loud scenes, but others more subtle.  And some are EXPLOSIVE.
The movie should be watched at least twice to catch everything.  In some scenes, the stuff going on in the background is hilarious.  And Ellen Birkin reveals a real comic gift, as does Allison Janney.  And Kirstie Alley is outstanding as the mother trying to recreate her past in her daughter.Highly recommended.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

This isn't a movie I'd rent, but it's a good TV movie.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
95,Cindy-39,a misguided attempt at comedy,3,13 January 2001,"Drop Dead Gorgeous is an unfortunate entry into the ""mockumentary"" category made great by Waiting For Guffman andSpinal Tap.  And if you've seen either of those movies (and Best InShow, which came later), Drop Dead Gorgeous would have to lookamateurish in comparison.  DDG borrows heavily from Waiting ForGuffman in particular (both are mock documentaries about amidwestern small town pageant, with ""interviews"" with thetownspeople, etc.), but really falls flat on its face because itssense of humor is so exaggerated and mean spirited.Because the subject matter (beauty pageants) is so easy to makefun of, the movie has to be very subtle in order to appear clever. That's why Waiting For Guffman was funny - the actors appearedso genuine that the ""mocking"" hit the target right on.  Drop DeadGorgeous, on the other hand, tries to hit you over the head with itstoo-obvious jokes in every single scene and gets tedious real fast. You might say that it's unfair to compare the sort-of-legendaryWaiting For Guffman to this movie, but I don't think Drop DeadGorgeous could have existed without being influenced by Guffman.  
Someone here mentioned that this movie kind of resembles JohnWaters' flicks (Pecker, Hairspray, Polyester) because of how overthe top and raunchy they are.  I think that could have been a goodpossibility if Drop Dead Gorgeous had a better director.  Thedirector here plays all his characters as if they had mental defects,which is not only mean spirited but juvenile as well.  He also hasall the actors shouting their lines in a stilted, super exaggerated,fake midwestern accent.  This is especially obvious in Kirstie Alley,Kirsten Dunst, and Brittany Murphy's characters.  Their accentsdefinitely didn't resemble anything from the midwest, the south, orwell, anywhere.  I mean, if you're gonna make fun of someone'saccent, at least get it right.  In the end, the people who made thismovie come out looking more foolish than the people they're tryingto portray, which is quite a feat.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
96,philfromno,So many things to hate in this film,2,7 September 2002,"Where to start...Well, the misuse of the mockumentary form should be mentioned.  So many of my favorite comedies, from Spinal Tap to Waiting For Guffman have used this form to hilarious effect.  What the people who made this film missed, though, is that these films rely on subtlety and a certain kind of naturalism that comes from the use of improvisation (and talented actors, of course.)  The comedy here is so over the top and histrionic, the acting so ridiculous, that the documentary style falls apart.  It seems like the filmmaker's used this form as an excuse to have the characters speak all of the exposition directly into the camera.  They certainly don't seem married to the premise, as they basically act out a standard comedy plot (minus the humor, that is) in front of the supposed documentary camera.  The absurdities here include a dance scene where there are at least 7 or 8 camera angles, and plenty of private conversations.  By the end, the filmmakers seem to have forgotten that they were even making a mockumentary, as the camera seems to be wherever an important plot point is occurring.Second point.  I'm not particularly offended by tasteless humor, but here they really seemed to have forgotten to actually write any jokes.  It's as if it's inherently funny to show a huge retarded man-child or a girl dying from anorexia.  In fact, the poor anorexic girl must have really made the director bust a gut, as they drag her out twice without writing a single joke for her.All of the characters have their supposedly hilarious quirk, which is basically repeated every time they show up on screen (""I'm a slut"", ""I like sign language"", ""My brother's gay."")It all grinds away to a dull and obvious conclusion and then, inexplicably, keep on going, until you fear that this desperately unfunny movie will simply never end.  At only an hour and a half, it feels like it takes all day to end, but you will be thankful to see it go.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
97,ceeingred13,My favorite mockumentary,8,23 February 2012,"Irreverent, fun and light. Not exactly a subtle jab at pageants, but a hilarious one. All the stereotypes you'd expect are there, but it doesn't keep them from being amusing at every turn. The talking heads in this movie are consistently excellent, as are the performances. Kirsten Dunst, Allison Janey, Denise Richards, Brittany Murphy and the rest of the cast do a wonderful job handling their consistently silly, but familiar characters. The film drags a bit towards its predictable (but not unsatisfying) ending, but the laughs it accumulates along the way give it the momentum required to push through. I'd recommend it to anyone.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
98,Paguma,Not an attack on Christianity,6,14 February 2000,"This movie was not an attack on Christianity, it was an attack on good taste. There were jokes which were purposely off-color, and that's fine in small doses, but they kept milking them to the point it wasn't funny anymore. For example, the past beauty queen winner being annorexic. If they stopped after showing her in the hospital the first time, it would have been funny, but no they had to constantly parade the sick and weak looking girl around through the rest of the movie thereby ""making fun"" of people with eating disorders. I didn't find that funny at all, and quite distasteful.My biggest problem with the movie was that most of the jokes were just not very funny. The idea for the movie was pretty good though, just didn't deliver very well.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
99,tommythek,Be afraid! Be VERY afraid!,10,4 September 2001,"Afraid of what? Afraid that there are real people just like the characters portrayed in this movie. And you KNOW that there are!DDG is a complete sendup of beauty pageants. Another ""Miss Congeniality"" or ""Smile"" it is NOT! It assails the institution of beauty pageants and after this movie has its way with that institution, one can never again watch any beauty pageant at all without a non-jaundiced eye rooted in DDG.In DDG, the pageant in question is the fictional Miss Teen Princess America and most of the movie revolves around the local qualifier in the made-up town of Mount Rose, Minnesota. Mount Rose: that's also the home (as proclaimed on a billboard entering town) of Freda Hegstrom, Minnesota's oldest living Lutheran. Except that, as we quickly find out, poor Freda has been dead for years. And it's all downhill from there!If one takes the time to read all 192 (or so) of IMDb's ""User Comments"" on this movie, as I have, one quickly finds that the one thing upon which we can all agree about DDG is that none of us can agree on DDG. You either love it or you hate it with hardly anyone in between on it. The same goes for all the major critics. Why is this? Why do so many people see this movie in so many different lights and from so many different points of view?My answer, which is certainly open to challenge, is that DDG takes no prisoners. None at all. It is an equal opportunity insulter of all things human, no matter how cherished or deeply felt some of those things might happen to be (to some or to many people). DDG's roster of insultees: Minnesotans, Japanese, Christians (generally), Lutherans (specifically), Jews, gun lovers, the overweight, the mentally challenged, Mexicans, anorectics, the rich, trailer trash, alcoholics, African-Americans, male-voyeurs-of-nubile-young-females, hospital candy stripers, beauty pageant contestants (AND the judges AND the pageant organizers AND the contestants' families, ESPECIALLY their moms).....and on and on. And those are just the categories of insultees in this movie that I can remember! If any category of insultable humanity has been omitted from this movie, it is only because there is just so much one can squeeze into any one movie. Is it any wonder that so many people hate this movie?But I'm not one of them. I LOVE this movie! And I say that as a member of more than one of the aforementioned categories of insultees. I consider Lona Williams' screenplay to be brilliant. Ms. Williams does not spare even herself. Not only is she a former beauty pageant contestant, she also has a prominent role in the movie, appearing in many scenes, as one of the pageant's judges. Yet, knowing her own acting ability (apparently), she has given herself not one word of dialogue! And Michael Patrick Jann was the perfect choice for a director to put every word of her ingenious script on the screen in countless subtly-nuanced scenes exactly as Ms. Williams intended them.Just HOW divided are people on DDG? My best friend in the world is a woman who lives in California. She has not seen this movie. But if she WERE to see it, she would hate every minute of it from beginning to end. This is a movie which, once you've seen it, you can't help but have a one-sided opinion of it. And my-sided opinion of it is.....""10.""",Drop Dead Gorgeous

101,Hitchcock and Kubrick Lover,IF YOU DON'T FIND THIS MOVIE HYSTERICAL...YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU!,10,29 July 2000,"Kirstie Alley is utterly hysterical in this satire about beauty pageants. Alley plays Gladys Leeman a beauty pagent has-been that is running the 1995 Sara Rose American Teen Princess Beauty Pagent for Mount Rose, Minnesota. Alley's phony daughter, Rebecca (Denise Richards [hysterical]) is competing in the pagent along with Amber Atkins (Kristen Dunst) and other girls. Dunst definitely has more talent than Richards and the movie is absolutely hysterical on showing what is happening up to the pagent night.  Many hysterical scenes are within this movie and by far this was the funniest movie I've seen in a long time.  Watch for the funniest scene where Richards dances with Jesus on a crucifix.Alley is hysterical as the Mount Rose Beauty Pageant commander with her country accents.  Ellen Barkin is hysterical as Kirsten Dunst's mother and the melted beer can attached to her hand.  Denise Richards is hysterical as Alley's daughter playing the phony, Christian girl.  Allison Janney (my god she can act...she was awesome in ""American Beauty"" as Ricky's mother too) plays Barkin's hysterical friend with her great one-liners, and Kirsten Dunst was hysterical as the intelligent, Beauty Pageant, ""trailer trash"" tenant.

Plus a superb turn from Denise Richards in the role she was born to play. The only one who goes a bit OTT is Kirstie Allie but everyone else is pretty restrained, considering.Not only that, but the script is dark, dark, dark. If you think bulimia isn't at all funny, wait til you see this flick... au contraire, mon cheri, its hilarious!

103,clurge-2,An incredibly well-made film...with a stellar cast...,7,29 January 2001,"This is probably the first, and last, time you'll ever hear the words ""stellar cast"" to describe a feature film starring Kristie Alley. There. Now that I got the Kristie Alley cheap shot out of the way, I can accurately review this film.Without a doubt, the best kept secret of 1999. It came out with little hype, and to my recollection, made little noise at the box office. Still, the film is witty, post-modern, truthful, and full of satire. The director takes you behind the scenes of Nowhere, USA beauty pageants, and the jealousy contained therein. One of the most beautiful and unique aspects of the film is that it's shot documentary style. We are given the ""honest"" opinion of the director, and what he sees. And what he sees very well may be the truth...magnified to the tenth degree.Kristen Dunst is wonderfully cast as the sweet innocent girl (like most other Dunst roles) who comes from a poor family, and aspires to be the greatest of all beauty queens. On the other end of the spectrum, we have Denise Richards thrown in as a wealthy snob who feels threatened by the innocent girl, and along with her mom (Kristie Alley) tries to off her any way she can.  I couldn't think of two Hollywood sex bombs better suited to play these opposites. Throw in Ellen Barkin as Dunst's mom (who gets a beer can fused to her hand after a nasty explosion) and it makes up the incredible core cast for the film.Something about this movie just draws me to it. Could be anything from the colourful sets, to the music by Mark Mothersbaugh (from DEVO!), or the creative mock-u-mentary style. But in all honesty, it's the casting. Everyone played superior roles, and special mention should be given to Mike McShane and Will Sasso, who played the large father and son team of Harold and Hank Vilmes. Incredibly hilarious stuff. See this film to discover a fairly well kept secret of Hollywood.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

The fact that the movie respects no taboo is highly refreshing in today's obsessively 'politically correct' world.This is not a silly comedy.

It's the absurdity of situations and the brilliant dialogues that distinguish this movie.If you enjoyed 'American Beauty' and the way that movie made clever fun of the American way of life, you will love 'Drop Dead Gorgeous'.

The plot is simple enough, a 'survival of the fittest' predator trying to dominate through intimidation and dirty tricks, succumbs to good and wholesome virtue, and general good character.In reality the far right will get their panties in a bunch by this film since their spokesmodel loses.

110,dan9241,One of the funniest movies ever made,10,15 April 2000,"OK. So it's not ""Waiting For Guffman."" No movie will ever be Guffman and I also doubt than any director will ever make a better mockumentary than Christopher Guest can. So leave that at the door when you see this movie. ""Drop Dead Gorgeous,"" while its documentary-style is not as authentic as Guffman's, is probably just as funny (but in a different way). I saw it in theaters (there were 6 people there) and my friends and I LOVED IT. We laughed out loud on many occasions. Sure, the humor is offensive to many, but that's the point. Too many movies want to be cutting edge and risky, but are afraid to go all the way. ""Drop Dead Gorgeous,"" makes no apologies for anything, and doesn't sugarcoat the material. That's what makes it so wonderful.Of course, there are also some amazing performances, most notably by Kirstie Alley (who is so over-the-top, especially near the end), Kirsten Dunst, Denise Richards, Ellen Barkin, Brittany Murphy, Nora Dunn (in a brief role towards the end), Matt Malloy (he was the nerdy one in ""In The Company of Men"") and the endlessly versatile Allison Janney: she's been loud and humorous in this and ""The Object of My Affection,"" a key supporting character in ""The Ice Storm,"" (she hosted the key party), and was devastatingly quiet as Col. Fitts's wife in ""American Beauty."" Keep giving her good material!Back to this film - there is no need to be offended if you truly think about how silly everything is. I usually love black comedies, but for the darkness (I normally don't find much true humor in them). Here, though, I laughed more than usual. I won't reveal too much, but the scene involving the lip-synched ""Don't Cry Out Loud,"" had me rolling on the floor. As did many other scenes. If you enjoy a good black comedy (and agree that many Americans are quite hypocritical), then you will LOVE this movie. It's a groundbreaking masterpiece.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
111,Curtize,Wickedly funny.,7,28 August 1999,"Drop Dead Gorgeous	-	***This mockumentary follows the exploits of a half dozen teenage contestants in a beauty pageant staged in a small midwestern town.  We meet the plucky, goodhearted girl (Kirsten Dunst) who practices her tap dancing as she performs her night job - applying make up to the corpses in the morgue.  We also meet the beautiful, soulless, evil, Kathy Lee Gifford wannabe (Denise Richards,) whose enemies seem to meet with unfortunate ends.  This film skewers everything, from beauty pageants to cheerleaders, from trailer trash to the gun culture.  It is quite funny, but also merciless.  Frequently, as when Denise Richards performs her talent number with a statue of Jesus on the cross, you may find yourself cringing as you laugh.  Unfortunately, the film is a shade too hyperbolic.  It takes too much glee in poking fun at its subjects as it leaves reality far behind.  One character, for instance, suffers physical mutilation played for laughs.The performances are strong.  Kirsten Dunst is outstanding as the intelligent and charming lead character.  Judging by this film, she will not join the long, sad list of child actors who lose all of their talent and charm when they turn fourteen.  Denise Richards is well cast as the beautiful villain, because she is not a very good actress, and here she is playing the part of a vain, soulless mannequin.  Ellen Barkin, cast against type as Dunst's trashy mom, is always entertaining.  The film is directed and scored well, but I was dismayed by one thing:  It did not make the best use of it's mock documentary format.  The camera was too stable, the angles too well-planned.My only other complaint is structural in nature:  The film simply goes on too long.  When the pageant is over and a winner is named, the movie continues for what seems an eternity, following the town's representative in the state and national competitions.  Did we really need to see this?  The answer is no.  When the first pageant ends, so does the drama.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

In one of the early scenes at the trailer park, the documentary makers are filming the mom and her friend (done hilariously by Allison Janney) and when they notice the cameras, she says, 'Are we on Cops again ?'To me it passes an important test when I can watch this film a numbers of times and still laugh at the girl talking about her 'lucky bolt' and the creepy rival talking about solving world hunger with her mom's apple pie. It really is chock full of hilarious lines that are still quite funny after watching the film a few times over the years.If you liked movies like Best in Show, you will like this a lot.

115,tgibbs279,Funny Movie; Its Critics Miss The Point,10,11 May 2001,"I'm a fan of this movie. I went to see it in 1999 because I like looking at Kirsten Dunst and Denise Richards, but I was stunned when it turned out to be a sharp, smart, dark satire of not only beauty pageants, but also small-town American life.    The movie is filled with bright performances and clever one-liners and scenes. I'll confess: not everything works. But it has more laughs than just about any other movie I've seen in the last two or three years.   I'm baffled by the hatred some people have for this movie. And I'm amused by the criticisms of the performances. Some of the people who've criticized the Minnesota accents aren't from the Midwest. I'm from the South. I'll criticize bad Southern accents when I hear them, but I'm not an expert on a good Minnesota dialect. Are DDG's critics? If a real, authentic, bona fide Minnesotan tells me the movie's accents are lousy, I'll believe it.    I am a Christian person. Many critics of DDG, including some who have commented here, seem to think this is an anti-Christian movie. I don't see it that way. I disagree with their assessment of the scene with Denise Richards singing to a Christ doll on a cross. To me, the moviemakers are satirizing people who publicly pat themselves on the back for their religious beliefs. In effect, Denise Richards' character is saying ""Look at me -- I'm a Superchristian!""    Funny movie. I give it three stars out of four.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

Kirstie Alley, Ellen Barkin, Kirsten Dunst and Denise Richards are all perfectly cast. Not your ordinary comedy, much more akin to the humor in Very Bad Things.As good as the whole cast is, Ellen Barkin really steals the show in this movie playing a beer guzzling, trailer park, hairdressing single mother with faults aplenty-but a heart of gold.

I have to be honest, I didn't expect much from this film, which maybe explains the surprise. I don't like Kirstie Alley, or Ellen Barkin. But the younger cast makes this film worth while. Kirstin Dunst is great! Denise Richards is hot as always. And the remainder of young contestants are perfect. Many of the supporting cast is hilarious as well. Drop Dead Gorgeous is great for a laugh. I also can't help compare it to more successful dark comedies like Rushmore and Election, and believe it or not, this is darker, and funnier.

Heck, she could get an award for all that. The movie follows Amber Atkins, a poor, nice girl who deserves to win the local beauty pageant, and her feircest competition is Becky, a totally fake snob determined to win, and she's funny because you know that everything she says is fake and rehearsed!  I thought the part where Amber is talking to her mom in the hospital about quitting was very touching.  The movie as a whole is just plain crazy and entertaining, taking turns left and right, and always funny.  The psudo-documentary style allowed for tons of laughs that wouldn't be possible in standard form of filming, because it seems more real that way, everything is a bit more funny and a bit more moving, and then the cinematography seems a lot better too. It does have some black humor in there, such the deaths, Becky's performance at the pageant, and the stuff with the retard may offend some peopleBut all in all, it was a great movie, the performances were all good (Dunst may seem a bit overly sweet, but that's okay), and I don't know why any critic would give it thumbs down, because it's just so hilarious!!!

How has this lady and, for that matter, Tony Danza, enjoyed a successful career when so many talented people can't get work? Such are the mysteries of show business. With better editing, directing and casting- this could have been a very funny film.

Set in the town of Mt. Rose, Minnesota, DDG focuses on the antics of a local beauty pageant in which the winner has a chance to go to State and possibly even Nationals.  The cast here is top notch, with Alison Janney being the scene stealer (along with guilty pleasure Alexandra Holden as the reigning queen).  As you laugh, however, you won't be able to help but feel guilty.  Every minority, ethnic group, rich girl, poor girl, Lutheran, and eating disorder patient is mocked way over the top in this clever but wicked comedy.

Ultimately a tale of rich/evil against poor/good, the black humour and satire against white-trash American culture serve to make this one of the funniest films of the year so far. All the main roles are superbly played, most notably perhaps by Ellen Barkin, cast out-of-type as the aging, drunken mother of Kirsten Dunst. My only criticism is that the last 15 minutes of the film was perhaps too laboured and needless.

But this is no average beauty pageant.

Therefore, I found this black comedy very amusing indeed and well worth an hour and three-quarters of my time.The humour works very well, and is extreme in its parodies of the lengths that people will go to to win, even in such a pathetic contest as a beauty pageant. Gladys Leeman (Kirstie Alley) is the super-bitch mother of Becky (Denise Richards), her perfect sugar-princess daughter. The richest family in a small town, Gladys is desperate that her daughter should win the beauty contest as she had done herself years before. However, one other competitor stands in Becky's way: Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst), a poor but talented trailer-park resident, stands a chance of beating her to the title. A series of bizarre deaths follows, and so foul play becomes a possibility.That anyone could really find this offensive or even blasphemous surprises me enormously - perverse gun laws, invocation of religion for personal gain, greed and superficiality are all surely legitimate targets, and the film hits them right on the head. It is moral hypocrisy which is satirised, not beliefs themselves.The mock-umentary style works well, with shaky hand-held camera effects, and allows the back-chat and scheming to be shown clearly, rather than just the outwardly positive image the subjects would wish to otherwise portray.While some might (with good reason) criticise the ending as rushed and unnecessary, it does at least tie up the story properly with the result the audience hopes for, and doesn't spoil the effect too much.All in all, good fun, and don't be offended.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

And if you need a goofy lead character actor (like Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler or Jerry Lewis), you should not bother, either, because the backbone of this humor is subtle.  Finally, if you expect everyone in a movie to be normal, don't bother, because a lot of humor involves eccentricites.OK, that narrows the field down to a handful.

The acting is first rate (Alley, Richards and Dunst are brilliant) with great accents. The problems are that a good number of the 'filler' jokes fall flat, too many for it to be the classic it should be and this makes the film start to feel too long towards the end.

I'm so glad Hulu decided to stream it as I still only have that old VHS copy put up somewhere. I asked my bf to watch this with me as we like the Office and Parks and it's shot in the same style throughout the film. The humor for the most part is subtle and dry. You really have to pay attention to some of the things that are said and others are just outright hilarious and need no cluing in.
Another great thing about this movie is the cast. I mean look at Amy Adams. I can't believe she got started here with this. Also, Brittany Murphy. She is gone much too soon and she was such a funny person. Her laugh throughout this movie is infectious.

This film had a terrible script, was way darker than we expected.Two particular components of the film suggest a PG13 was way too soft.

But I found out it was darker than that, and eventually got around to watching it, and I loved it.It's a mockumentary about a beauty pageant in a fictional small town in Minnesota laced with murder, bribery and blackmail. Hilarity ensues! Hilarious one liners, great performances all around, especially by Allison Janney. Denise Richards, Kirsten Dunst, Ellen Barkin and even though I usually don't like her, Kirstey Alley was great too. Minor roles are also played well, one of my favourites being the woman from Austin Powers.I can see how some people are offended by this, as it tackles some tough issues, so if you're easily offended don't see this. Also, I don't think this movie is anti-Minnesota. It's set in a fictional small town, and not all characters are looked down on anyway.My only gripe about this movie, is that it doesn't always feel like a documentary, as it is supposed to be. Watch especially in Amber's tap performance, the crew would have needed about 5 cameras to film this sequence, when it seems they only have one or maybe two.But that's only a minor concern in what is a hilarious film.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

This movie is just painful to watch.  I must admit, I didn't even watch all of it, my four friends and I fast-forwarded through several parts.  I laughed maybe twice.This was also the most politically incorrect movie I have ever seen. Several times I was offended.  I guess these things were supposed to be funny.

One of the funniest movies of the last years, respectless, with a big portion of black humor. White Trash at it's best. Specially Ellen Barkin and her best friend Allison Janney are hillarious. I think there is no better way to create a picture of the middlewest. A prety good independent picture wich cries out for more from director Jann and screenwriter Lona Williams. It would be so fresh and nice, if some of these 70 million Dollar Major Flicks would have just as half the funny lines as this movie. Sure a big eight out of ten.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

Anyone who claims this movie is ""dumb"" is either a) uptight or b) dense. You've gotta pay attention and keep it all in perspective.

I laughed so hard during most of it that I missed things and had to go back and watch it. My favorite character is Hank, the paint huffer. Will Sasso played that so well. I love during the Camera interview when we first meet the judges and Hank is all like ""Are we on Cops?"" Harold tells him to go away and Hank continues leading to a slapping fight and then right after he is back to huffing. Then he ends up with the store in the end and covered in FOIL. I just thought it was so funny. And when he is taking his pants off during the interviews. I also loved the Accents, I thought they did a very good job on those. All in all this film is very entertaining and I recommend anyone who needs a good laugh at something most people make fun of anyways (PAgents) should watch this at least once.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

And it ain't gonna be pretty.In the small Midwest community of Mount Rose, Minnesota, the Sarah Rose Miss Teen Princess contest is into the final furlong. But for all the sugar-coated spoutings of world peace and harmony hairspray, it's a question of victory by any means necessary - as a roving documentary film crew discovers.In the Blue Ribbon rhubarb pie corner is Becky Leeman (Richards, rich kid daughter of former winner and rabidly proud officiating beauty pageant President Gladys (Alley). And in the red, trailer-trash corner is morgue make-up artist Amber Atkins (Dunst), championed by her boozy mother Annette (Barkin) and her mother's morally suspect best friend Loretta (Janney).Casting wise it's spot on, as Alley launches with smiley, viper spitefulness into a beacon of single-minded hypocrisy, and is well matched by Richards, even if she looks the least convincing high school teenager since Stockard Channing's Rizzo enrolled in Rydell High. Dunst meanwhile blossoms into a very accomplished actress, and - together with Barkin and Janney - claims most of the prize lines.If there's a weakness it's that the mockumentary approach doesn't always work, and the film drags on a little too long after a seemingly natural conclusion. Still, the dark laughs are consistent, and the parody of middle America's bizarre beauty contest fixation is spiked with some jolting shock tactics - from the nurse-assisted wheelchair dance by the reigning anorexic crown holder to Richards' hilarious (not to mention blasphemous) love song for Jesus - but such blackness never obstructs rooting for Dunst's likable teen.

163,efs2,Brutally Wicked And Hilarious,9,14 June 2010,"I just watched this again for the first time in a few years. And it is even more hilarious than I remembered. The script is wicked, creating satire that assaults the senses like a baseball bat to the gut. The cast is perfect. Just about everyone delivers an inspired performance, and there are too many to talk about all of them. But the least likely is worth mentioning. Denise Richards is brilliant as a born-to-be beauty queen, the daughter of the local pageant manager, played by Kirstie Alley. Her ""talent"" performance is the dark highlight of the movie, so ridiculously over-the-top that that you may feel the need to wince. Try not to. If you close your eyes for even a moment, you'll miss something.Brittany Murphy also deserves a special mention. She plays a goofy, good-natured contestant in what would be a throw-away role for many actors. But Murphy brings a charm and commitment that makes it work.

Though you recognize some of the characters from your own experiences, Lona Williams' script takes you on an unpredictable roller-coaster ride via the lives of the contestants and their loved ones.Ellen Barkin surprises and scores with her off-beat version of the trailer-trash girl's mom, Annette.  Kirsten Dunst continues to improve with refreshingly upbeat turn as her daughter, Amber.  Denise Richards draws a believable caricature as Becky, the rich girl every commoner hated growing up.  Kirstie Alley, as her mom and pageant director Gladys, is adequate, but seems a bit miscast.Expecting nothing, I was given a gift because it was hilarious.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

When Reiner and Guest brought the mockumentary into life, I thought that they were funny but I felt that they were written for the effete end of the cultural elite. The comedy was underplayed so often you had to be in the elite to ""get it"". Then I saw Williams' Drop Dead Gorgeous. Terry Southern lives.Drop Dead Gorgeous is my favorite mockumentary. Williams' satire is manna for those of us amongst the great unwashed who, like Williams, had to break out of jerkwater towns and their caste systems. Where I came from the royal wedding was when the heir to the local sheep company married the gal whose dad, just like in DDG, owned the furniture store.My empathic side just writhes in pleasure in watching this dark little film as I imagine Williams savoring an iced dish of revenge.I was curious to note that the reviews in the regular press found this little gem to be mean-spirited and crude. The index on Rotten Tomatoes, a metric that I am usually compatible with was oddly low. Judging from the comments I imply that the caste that now serves us in journalism is skewed toward the effete end of the group I alluded to in the opening.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

Kirstie Alley plays her part perfectly and Allison Janney is a hoot! Every part is played to perfection and there are no slow spots in it at all. I believe I could watch this ten more times and still catch something funny that I missed before. If you like dry humor, you will absolutely love this movie.

I would have given it 19 if score had been out of 20, so the extra half mark out of ten is for my UK love for the way it sneers at small town America, and is brilliantly offensive in doing so.

Kirsten Dunbst and Denise Richards play the two top contenders for thew crown, the first a trailer trash near-Pollyanna and the second an amoral predator whose only saving grace is that she's not quite as bad as her mother, played with gusto by Kirstie Alley.I had seen previews for the film which did not do it justice, making it seem like just another riff on She's All That or Cruel Intentions, but it is so much more.  If you ever saw Michael Ritchie's Smile, this is its bastard child.  I was hooting and chuckling uneasily throughout, as the filmmakers take a jaundiced view of a small Minnesota town and its inhabitants' obsession with winning a prize that is virtually worthless.  Filmed in a pseudo-documentary style, it is full of surprises and telling details. Having just made its cable debut, it will now get a shot at the audience it never got in theatres.If you don't have the right sense of humor, Drop Dead Gorgeous will doubtless offend you somewhere along the line, especially if you're from Minnesota (although the Fargo-style accents are far more muted here), or if you're gay, deaf, Jewish. Japanese or suffering from Down's Syndrome.  And this is not a good movie to see if you're trying to quit smoking 00 the nicotine consumption in this film is enough to make Jeffrey Wigand pick up the habit again.

Great performances from Kirstie Alley, Denise Richards, Kirsten Dunst, Ellen Barkin, Brittany Murphy, and all the others. I don't think there were many times when I wasn't laughing. If I had to say something bad about the film I would say that they were kind of copying off of a few other movies: Fargo, Something about Mary, and I Know what you did last summer. It's like Fargo because they talk in the same accents. I'm sure the writers and directors knew that since Fargo's talking was the most memorable thing in the movie, they had a market. It's like There's Something about Mary because just like Mary, they deal with a mentally handicapped person and made it funny. It's like  I Know what you did last summer because both movies use a cheesy, small-town beauty pageant to base the film on. Even though ""movie copycatting"" is one of pet-peeves about films, ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" was so funny, that I was able to get passes all that. Well done!",Drop Dead Gorgeous

The only flaw in this movie is that Denise Richards is just way too old to play a teenage girl... and after playing Christmas Jones on 007, yeah that sure makes sense.  But this movie is a refreshing film.  Not typical slapstick comedy.  Would it be appropriate to call it intelligent comedy.

Huh? I believe a 180° correction needs to be said: If you're a fan of such incredibly well-written, thoughtful and satirical movies as ""This is Spinal Tap"", ""Waiting for Guffman"" and ""Best In Show"", you'll thoroughly wish you hadn't wasted your time with this movie. Granted, it's a pretty good cast, but people, people, you can't put a tiara on a turd and crown thee entertainment. Once you've stepped in this movie it's all you can do to clean it off yourself before you track it anywhere else. In fact, my wife sniffed this video out 15 minutes in and left the room before getting it all over herself. Not me, I managed to trudge through this mess for nearly an hour. Yes, in `Drop Dead Gorgeous' Michael Patrick Jann & Lona Williams tried to clone the formula that has worked so well for Christopher Guest, Eugene Levy and others. And no, these writer/ directors do not have proprietary rights to the mockumentary format, but they do have, however, one element that Jann/Williams do not, and that's talent-a flair, finesse and faculty for the form. Aside from a solid performance by Kirsten Dunst, and yeoman efforts by Allison Janney and Ellen Barkin, this movie has more value as VHS tape than a DVD-at least with tape you can rerecord over it. Or maybe we'll be able to look back on this effort and perhaps thank it for ending the truly sorry career of Kirstie Alley, who possesses all the magnetism, charm and ability of a 3- day old bowl of shredded wheat. (And no, hawking bamboo for Pier 1 does not count as a `career boost.' -don't get me started there.)For the movie itself, it was predictable to waning to miserable in progression. Can anyone say they were surprised by any one element or character in this mess? Bitch Queen Stage Mother with Spoiled Princess Daughter, Apple Pie All-American Girl, Anorexic Champions, Retarded Townspeople. I'm surprised they didn't include a Pregnant Teen Smoker, or an Alcoholic Trailer-Trash Girlfriend, oh wait. they did! (And unless the title of your movie includes `DORF' or `Benny Hill,' getting hit in or falling on one's crotch DOES NOT COUNT AS COMEDY. We've see it every week on `America's Funniest Home Movies' folks, it's played out.)With the sometime exception of Dunst, by playing each and every character to its extreme, there was little measure left for true comedy-nuance, timing and development. I'd love to continue discussing how horrible `Drop Dead Gorgeous' was, but you get the point, or poop. Dunst earns this mess a pity vote. 2 out of 10 on the IMDB scale.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

At first, I wasn't sure what it was, but as the movie moved forward, I was pulled in and was thoroughly entertained. With the over the top accents, the over the top performances, and the over the top story, it all makes for one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Another killer cast including Kirsten Dunst, Ellen Barkin, Denise Richards, Brittany Murphy, a pre-Fat Actress Kirstie Alley, scene stealing Allison Janney, and side-splittingly hilarious Will Sasso. Every time Will Sasso shows up, I just crack up laughing. It works on so many levels, especially as a mockumentary. Where Spinal Tap, probably regarded as the first and best of the genre, is dry and bordering on boring, Drop Dead Gorgeous is fast talking and full of exciting visual gags. And, like The One and The Faculty, it has found a second life on television, which makes it super accessible for everyone.

The amazing capacity for all of these actors and actresses to make fun of themselves is just amazing.  I think it would be safe to say that one has not truly experienced humility until they have been in a movie like this.  Of course Eugene Ley has been making a living out of these sorts of roles since Splash. If you liked this and want to see more, check out Spinal Tap, Best in Show, and Waiting for Guffman.

178,Taharez,Bloody brilliant,9,22 July 2004,"Drop Dead Gorgeous is a movie worth seeing if you like the twisted black comedy genre at all. Great characters and spot-on acting by Dunst are just two reasons this movie works so well.The story revolves around two young women, their mothers, and their participation in a local beauty contest, and is told in a fake-documentary style that fits surprisingly well.Kirsten Dunst is, as always, perfect for the role, delivering the over-the-top goody-two-shoes behaviour and dialogue with a conviction that's sometimes cause for laughs all on it's own. That's not to say there's not a lot of other sources of fun, I suffered from stomach aches quite a few times, and it was certainly not from something I ate. To give credit where credit is due, I cannot neglect mentioning Ellen Barkin as the mother, she plays her part with great competence. Especially after a certain encounter with a fire-bomb and a beverage can.While I'm not a fan of either Denise Richards or Kirstie Alley, they do an adequate performance in their roles as the rival and her slightly insane mother.In conclusion, I can only tell you to see this movie if you enjoy some good laughs and a quite unique twist on the beauty contest theme.Rating: 9/10",Drop Dead Gorgeous

Allison Janney is amazing as always.  I really think that she may be the most underappreciated actress living.  And I think the greatest testimant to this movie is I own three copies, I quote it constantly, and I have seen it well over 50 times and I still laugh uncontrollably.  It is sick.  It is twisted.

Ellen Barkin as Amber's long-suffering mother is a standout as well as Allison Janney as Loretta, the neighbor you know you would love to have around.

Fun to see Kirsten Dunst, Denise Richards and Brittany Murphy come together as teenage rivals at 17, 28 and 22, respectively. Ellen Barkin and Allison Janney have their moments. But you might expect a lot more than this mildly black comedy. Put it another way: You might think ""Spinal Tap meets Heathers ... that could work,"" but it's as though the filmmakers followed the Christopher Guest formula and then watered it down so that there would be nothing too subtle, nothing too original, and nothing that could go over the head of an average 11-year-old (the prime audience for the teen movie genre).

Easy, Allison Janney (""Most smartest..."") steals the show in this movie. The rest supporting cast is incredible, including many character actors and a few unknowns.Kirsten Dunst is perfect in this movie as well, playing her slightly left-of-center role with grace and a lot of charm.Overall this is a quality movie.

Stupid jokes about hair, dresses, and stuff I couldn't care less about, right? Wrong. It's presented in that faux-documentary (or mockumentary) style that Christopher Guest has perfected. It pokes fun at middle America, small towns, that sort of ""redneckish patriotism"" we see so often, and of course the way these contestants (and their parents) take themselves WAY too seriously. It also shines as a mostly female comedic sandbox where Allison Janney, Ellen Barkin, Kirsten Dunst, Brittany Murphy, and Kirstie Allie can show off their comedic skills (I had no idea that some of them had it in them). All I can say is that it's hilarious. Will Sasso is the greatest ""handi-capable"" character ever put on film.

The town pageant from Hank's antics at the car to the conclusion is just perfect. The movie slogs a bit at the end (like the production ran out of money), but what comes before is just golden. Terrific cast, both up and coming - Kirsten Durst, early Brittany Murphy, Denise Richards and experienced actors - Sam McMurray, Mindy Sterling (""Scott!!!), Nora Dunn.

This movie will have you laughing your head off if you saw the recent movie Juno, simply because this movie while being guiltily satirical, has the feel of an independent film. Alison Janney and Kirstie Alley make this film a real gem to watch, and the budding careers of Kirsten Dunst and Amy Adams will also have you feeling nostalgic, with the Midwest Fargo-like accents in Minessoootaaaaa, you will not be bored.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
193,dcvalenz,Funniest mockumentary since Spinal Tap,10,24 July 1999,"As Americans watched young Jon Benet Ramsey prancing around in her thousand dollar evening gowns, people began to question the logic and meaning of child beauty pageants and what they stood for. I know I did.And I knew it would only be a matter of time before someone would make a film that captures essence of the screwed-up world that justifies these parades of pre-teen and teen princesses and pageant mothers.In the spirit of 'This is Spinal Tap' and 'Waiting for Guffman', this mockumentary about a teen beauty pageant in small town Minnesota is a hilarious satire of a slice of America that many find demeaning and downright ridiculous.Kirsten Dunst and Denise Richards are the focal characters, competing for the crown. Coming from complete opposite backgrounds, Dunst is ""trailer park trash"" who aspires to be like her mother and idol Diane Sawyer and win the pageant; and Richards comes from the wealthiest family in town and seems destined to follow her mother (Kirstie Alley) to the crown.Like the frightening true story of the Texas cheerleader murder, contestants are maimed or murdered so that one contestant can capture the crown.Dunst is absolutely charming as Amber, and Ellen Barkin is wonderful as her mother. Alley and Richards are equally good on the opposing side, with Alley portraying everything that's worthy of despisal in the freakshow of teen beauty pageants, as both organizer and as a pageant mom. Richards plays the second-generation beauty queen brilliantly as she waltzes through her interviews and talent competition with such rehearsed presentation.There are some ""dark"" themes that some people may find objectionable -- murdering/maiming of contestants, anorexic beauty queens, a creepy pageant judge who fantasizes about the young contestants, a mentally retarded man who sniffs paint fumes from a paper bag, and so on.But anyone who can set aside political correctness for a couple of hours will find this film absolutely hilarious.The story is absolutely brilliant, with no down time whatsoever. Every level of the screenplay is chocked full of laugh out loud dialog, not to mention everything that goes on in the background or appears on signs.It's easily the funniest comedy of the year, and one of the smartest films of the year. A satire that pulls no punches in giving us a biting glimpse at what goes on, or what we fear might actually go on, in thousands of these little freakshows in small towns across America.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

In its amazing ""mockumentary"" style, this movie made me laugh again and again. People may say that this has more laughs than American Pie, but they were a different kind of humor.    They were both equally enjoyable in their own ways.  American Pie is so appreciated because of its outrageous however realistic jokes.  These were very unrealistic, however outrageous and extremely entertaining ingredients for a movie that I consider to be a real winner.So, get out there, and after you see it, you will be ""showing some teeth""!",Drop Dead Gorgeous

This is the kind of film that cynical, sarcastic, intellectual b***ards like myself cannot wait to buy on digital.  The actors were great, wallowing in the insensitivity their roles afforded them. Do you not like it when people say ""bad things"" about others?  Go see Tarzan.  If you can take a joke about anything, and are waiting for a film that isn't cookie cutter summer fare, pay the admission.  We are allowed to enjoy a film that lampoons anorexia, trailer trash, Lutheran religion, teen pregnancies, mental retardation, guiltless murder, pedophiles, the recently deceased, gay stereotypes, stage moms, female athletes, drama students, business men's racism, and promiscuity.

Maybe some people find paedophilia, violent abuse and exploitation of people with mental disabilities funny, but I don't.The trailer for the film portrayed it as being quite funny -- it wasn't until I got into the cinema that I realized that the trailer has contained the only funny lines in the whole picture. To me, this was not ""satire"" nor ""black comedy"", it was just insulting and pathetic. It is thus far the only film I have wanted to walk out in the middle of, because I cared so little about the characters or what happened to them.The violence and deaths are disturbing in the way that they are treated as a joke... and not a funny one at that. The suffering that people endure in the film is very real, and yet the consequences of their actions are trivial. It is inconsistent. If you want to make suffering a joke, make it funny.

As a mockumentary, it actually deserves an 11 ...Bought it on DVD - can watch it again and again and my admiration for the perfection with which it has been made only grows. Every detail is right on the spot, the actors are fantastic, the script is amazing, and the director hits just the right note ...A biting social commentary if there ever was one, it shows a side of America which people pretend doesn't exist, and that without any exaggeration - it only condenses a lot of things into one story which in reality you probably would not find that close together. One can see that the author knows exactly what she is writing about. I can understand that many people don't like this film - it hits too close to home ... though they'll never admit that this is the reason and cite bad taste or whatever. The miracle for me is that this picture got made at all.Hard-hitting as it is, the film never gets mean - it always stays human and in a detached way almost compassionate towards all its characters. The author is a woman, and I noticed one thing about women as artists: if the're bad, they're bad as any male artist who's bad, but when they're good, they tend to be *exceptionally* good, and often they bring up angles which a man would have never thought of.One thing - I do not think the critique in this film concerns only America: exchange just a few minor cultural details for their continental counterparts and you'll see that here in Europe we have the same types of people who recognize themselves in this movie and consequently hate it, like their cousins overseas ... so finally I think its valid worldwide, wherever people live.",Drop Dead Gorgeous

I'm appalled that you would even consider adding such a ""film"" to your repertoire.  Bad career move! All in all - I could not be more disappointed with this movie.

My favorite has got to be the girl adopted by Asian parents. This seems to flash a big spot light on our own social practices, and only their biological daughter seems to see outside the whole pageantry mania.

You get to know all of the contestants in the pageant, and by the time the movie is over, you really feel like you know their personalities. Some people probably won't like this movie, but it seems very inexpensive...in a good way. Cleary the cast and crew did a lot with a little.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
238,ddales-19866,Best mockumentary comedy EVER!,10,16 July 2019,"This film has so many little jokes and goes hand in hand with the rise of uncomfortable comedy with will Farrell and recognition of Andy Kaufman during this time. I don't understand most of the reviews I have read.. maybe it's a generational comedy.. where the jokes are very dated to the era.. but the uncomfortable dry pan comedy screaming through the superb acting of Kirsty Alley or the physical diversity of Will Sasso ... it has all earmarks of a film that spawned the rise of docudrama style that lead to "" The Office"" and it's uncomfortable style comedy that only genius comedians can pull off without being awful. Please watch with a sense of awe that nothing like it was ever made before. The guffman one was no where near this awesome let alone star studded and story flow that let you float to the best bits without feeling bored and hits so many social morays with subtlety that you can only appreciate it more if you look at what other socially conscious movies came out around this time that didn't have an execu-type producer screwing it all up like American history x.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
239,braidyman,One of my favorites,9,16 May 2006,"I have a hard time enjoying most comedies as many current actors don't fit the roles they're casted for. A renowned critic I'm not, but it's rare for me to laugh at a movie. With that said, I love Drop Dead Gorgeous. As a north country native, I'm convinced of Kirsten's role as a dingy Minnesotan hoping to break free from the restraints of her hometown, Mount Rose. Amber Atkins is hysterical. I can't help but laugh when she is dancing music-video style as she makes her way home. Ellen Barkin is excellent as Annette Atkins and helps the script with a few classic one-liners. ""Well, I sat down to have a beer, and kablooey, next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window, and I'm ass-up in somebody's flower bed!"" Denise Richards is definitely a weaker member of the cast and is sometimes painful to watch, but the rest really make the movie shine (Allison Janney as ""GOT SOME!"" Loretta, Brittany Murphy, and the disturbingly anorexic former-pageant-winner included). It's worth watching this movie just to see the wheelchair rendition of Melissa Manchester's ""Don't Cry Out Loud"". Like I said, I'm from Minnesota so my comment may be biased. Who cares though. I'd give this movie a 10 if the ending was funnier.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
240,ggray-6,The best of the worst,10,2 October 2005,"Quite bluntly, this film is stupid. However, it's a rare breed, one of those ""good"" ""stupid movies"". I've read some reviews criticizing this film for not accurately portraying Minnesota. Some viewers simply don't get it. This movie is supposed to be ""stupid"". It is not supposed to be some supremely accurate social depiction of small town Minnesota. It is a mockumentary and an intentionally absurd exaggeration. And it works like a charm. If you ""get it"", this will be one of the funniest movies you'll ever view. The actors are almost, top to bottom, perfect... especially the portrayals of Amber Atkins' mother and aunt, and the Vilmes father and son. I can see how certain viewers would absolutely abhor this seemingly inane, ridiculous film. But it is, truly, a phenomenally clever spoof on a competition many treat as life and death. In fact, it's almost frightening that there's a little more realism in this farce than most would like to admit. This film is simply a fabulous little spectacle.Best line: ""You are a good person. Good things happen to good people."" ""Really?"" ""No, it's pure bull____, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it.""",Drop Dead Gorgeous

242,michaellopour,Not even close to a comedy,1,25 December 2017,"I have a very dark sense of humor, but I watched it because it had Deniese Richards in it, and was listed as a comedy. This is as much as a comedy as Flower of Flesh and Blood. Not one part even made me smile.",Drop Dead Gorgeous
