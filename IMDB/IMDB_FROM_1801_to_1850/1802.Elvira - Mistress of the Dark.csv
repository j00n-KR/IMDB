0,mark.waltz,"It ain't no classic, but Elvira knows how to hold them both (I mean it all) together.",5,6 August 2018,"An old friend of mine used to utilize lines from this movie as a part of his routine wisecrack response, whether saying, ""If I wanted your opinion, I'd beat it out of you!"" or responding to ""What should I call you?"". ""Tonight"". Cassandra Peterson, with a bawdy sense of humor and a self-deprecating way of keeping herself in check, makes every moment count. It is obvious that this was a film made for the audiences, not the critics, and it's just the type of popcorn movie that audiences flocked to before society began to take itself way too seriously. Usually, in horror spoofs like this, mere mortals end up in an old dark house, unsure of how to handle the spooky people who live there, but here, the all too goody goody Massachusetts town has the horror brought to them, or at least in ghoulish form. Inheriting part of her great aunt's estate, Elvira heads back to her mother's home town where she finds the prejudices mighty high upon her arrival, especially from the manipulative, Gladys Kravitz like Chastity Pariah (a delightful Edie McClurg) who has absolutely no sense of fun other than tasting everything in bulk at the boring socials that the town throws on special occasions.Immediately noticing that the young people are quite repressed, Elvira sets out right off the bat to change all that, inciting the wrath of nasty waitress Susan Kellerman who is upset that Elvira has enticed her supposed boyfriend, the hunky Daniel Greene. This leads to a bit of mean-spirited revenge that spoofs ""Flashdance"" but ends up with Elvira soaked with something other than gold glittered water. Elvira, through the help of a mysterious cookbook that her nefarious uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard) wants to get his hands on. In disguise as a supposed respectful townsperson, Sheppard has some nefarious plans up his sleeve, which literally sets the town (and Elvira) on fire. But between Elvira's chesty muscles, her street smarts and a magical dog, Sheppard is going to have his work cut out for him. It's the dark arts vs. the white arts, because it is made very clear that even though she dresses in witch's black and looks like Barbara Steele in ""Black Sunday"", Elvira ain't into all that Satanic garbage.A great supporting cast helps this become an entertaining mixture of slob comedy, horror spoof and cult classic, with McClurg delightfully stuffy, especially in her description of Elvira past the initial statement of ""a woman of easy virtue"". Character actor favorites William Duell and Pat Crawford Brown steal their moments as a married couple who own the local motor inn, with Duell much easier going than his judgmental wife, and getting a great last line in on Ms. Brown. Sheppard becomes one of the great campy movie villains, much like Christopher Lloyd in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"". There's also some great music here, including ""Shout!"" where the teens all willingly help Elvira fix up her house and a campy Vegas number which was Elvira's goal from the start to get away from the syndicated TV station where her only asset for the new station owner was located just below her neck. How she deals with the perverted pig is deliciously funny, as is the repercussions it presents for a stuffy news reporter, a gag later repeated with Kellerman's vindictive waitress.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
1,claudio_carvalho,Funny Cult-Trash,7,11 September 2016,"When a chauvinist millionaire buys the TV network where the sexy Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is the horror hostess of a late show, she quits her job with the intention of producing a show of her own in Las Vegas. However the producers demand 50 thousand dollars from her and Elvira does not have the money. Out of the blue, she receives a telegram informing that her great aunt Morgana died and she has an inheritance to receive. Elvira drives to Fallwell, in Massachusets, where her car breaks. While repairing the car, Elvira inherits an old house, a recipe book and a poodle. Her great uncle Vincent Talbot (W. Morgan Sheppard) proposes to buy her book, but the poodle hides it in the sofa. Meanwhile the conservative council of Fallwell feels uncomfortable with Elvira's clothes and behavior and does not let her find a job. But the cinema owner Bob Redding (Daniel Greene) and the local teenagers help Elvira. When she decides to cook a dinner to impress Bob, she uses Morgana's recipe and finds that it is indeed a spell book that belonged to her mother Divana. Further, Morgana has protected her from the warlock Vincent that wants the book to take over the world and destroy Elvira, who is a powerful witch. When Elvira refuses to sell the spell book to Vincent, her convinces the council that she is a witch that must be burned at the stake. How will Elvira stop the evil Vincent?""Elvira: Mistress of the Dark"" is a funny cult-trash that works for the fans. This cheesy film is hilarious despite all the silliness and the sexy Cassandra Peterson is the responsible for making it worthwhile watching. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Elvira: A Rainha das Trevas"" (""Elvira: The Queen of the Darkness"")",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
2,gavin6942,A Great Blend of 1980s Humor and Horror,7,19 August 2011,"When her Great Aunt dies, famed horror hostess Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) heads for the uptight New England town of Fallwell to claim her inheritance of a haunted house...This film actually scared me as a child, and watching it now, I am still not surprised. Sure, it is largely a comedy, but the ""casserole"" scene is still creepy in much the same way as ""Gremlins"" is creepy. Sometimes the scariest moments come when thrown into an otherwise tame film.Relying on many movie references, some horror, and plenty from ""The Wizard of Oz"", this is a movie fan's film. While not quite a parody, it shows a light-hearted love of pop cinema that I think will touch a lot of people.Vincent Talbot (W. Morgan Sheppard) is the ultimate villain. He has that look, that voice... he comes from the same mold as Vincent Price, Peter Cushing and Roddy McDowall. Except, sadly, I feel like he is largely unheard of, even with his endless list of credits under his belt.I love that this comes from the same ingredients as ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"", a film Peterson made a cameo in. Paul Reubens and Peterson were in comedy troupe the Groundlings together, as was John Paragon (here a gas station attendant, but otherwise better known as Jambi the Genie) and Edie McClurg. Perhaps they would make a good double feature?Mike Mayo seems to accept this movie for what it is when he says ""the story could rely less on well-worn gimmicks, but Elvira's flippant feminist irreverence goes a long way."" Indeed, it does use some lame gags, but that also seems to be the point. The film tries nothing other than to be the B-movie that it is. There is the subplot of her opening the eyes of the children (much like ""Ernest Goes to Camp""), and if you want to call her antics feminist...",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
3,BA_Harrison,"Delivers what fans expect: cleavage, cleavage and more cleavage.",6,27 February 2017,"Top-heavy horror show host Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) quits her TV job to try her luck in Vegas as a showgirl, not realising that she will need $50,000 to kick-start her new career. As luck will have it, that very same day she receives a letter informing her that she is a beneficiary of her late Aunt Morgana. Elvira packs her bags and drives to Fallwell, Massachusetts, for the reading of the will, where she learns that she has inherited her aunt's rundown house, a dog, and a cook book. What she doesn't realise is that her aunt was a witch, that the book contains recipes for spells, and that her Uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard) will do anything to get his hands on it. Meanwhile, the puritanical townsfolk of Fallwell, unimpressed by Elvira's appearance and demeanour, look for a way to be rid of their new neighbour.To be honest, the plot for Elvira: Mistress of the Dark is instantly forgettable schlock, the ribald gags not all that funny, and Peterson's abrasive schtick rather tiresome after a while, but it doesn't really matter that much: the film more than caters for its intended demographic—horny males—by ensuring that its buxom star flashes her impressive cleavage at every opportunity. A thigh high slit in her black dress also gives leg men plenty to appreciate, while those who like a shapely derriere will be pleased to know that Peterson also flashes her butt.Funniest gag: ""How's your head?"" asks town beefcake Bob (Daniel Greene) after dropping a sign on Elvira's nut. ""I haven't had any complaints yet,"" replies Elvira.Best boob scene: Elvira's Las Vegas act that sees the star twirling her tassles by gyrating her jugs. Mesmerising!",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
4,moonspinner55,TV sitcom masquerading as a feature film,5,31 July 2002,"Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is a very chipper presence on the screen, but her dry comments and costumed-Valley Girl disposition can't carry a movie very far. The plot--something to do with an inheritance, a book of spells, and Edie McClurg as a Mrs. Kravitz-type townsperson--isn't painful or slack, but it is extremely slight...and the horny teenage boys who keep trying to get a peek at Elvira's bazooms are like refugees from ""Porky's 3"". There's also a hunky love-interest for Elvira, but he doesn't seem especially like the type of guy she would go for (since when do ghouls get worked up over all-American beefcake?). It all leads to an FX-induced showdown and a finale in Las Vegas, but the real laugh-getter is Elvira and she's funny when she gets the chance. ** from ****",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
5,paul_haakonsen,Cool and fun...,7,15 December 2015,"I remember seeing this movie back when I was a teenager in the late 1980s. The movie was lots of fun back then and still is today, which is a noteworthy feat in itself. I have watched ""Elvira: Mistress of the Dark"" more than five times since first having on VHS - ah yes, those were the days - and it keeps being as entertaining as it was then.It is the light-hearted comedy and atmosphere of the movie that makes it well-worth watching again and again. But also the acting performances in the movie. Of course the role of Elvira being so amazingly performed by Cassandra Peterson; she is just wonderfully charming, witty and well-cast for the Elvira character. But also William Morgan Sheppard deserved applause here, because he really suits the villain role quite well.The story in ""Elvira: Mistress of the Dark"" is a magical story which includes scares (sort of), action, sorcery and lots and lots of humor.""Elvira: Mistress of the Dark"" is a wholeheartedly fun spooky (without actually being spooky) movie that can be seen by the entire Family. It is a good movie for a Halloween movie marathon.I enjoy this movie quite a lot and haven't seen it for the last time, that much is for certain.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
6,BandSAboutMovies,Elvira finally gets her movie!,7,21 February 2019,"After Easy Money, Saturday Night Live veteran James Signorelli directed one more film. This one - starring Cassandra Peterson as her Elvira character.In 1981, six years after Sinister Seymour, the producers of LA's Fright Night decided to do another show and asked Vampira - Maila Nurmi - to help them with the project. There were creative differences - supposedly Nurmi wanted Lola Falana to play Vampira - and soon the station just did the show themselves (for her side of the story, please watch Vampira and Me).Peterson had already lived a crazy life before she auditioned and won the role of the new horror host. She was a Vegas showgirl at 17, briefly dated Elvis, played a showgirl in Diamonds Are Forever, posed for men's magazines like High Society, tried out to be Ginger in a new Gilligan's Island, was on the cover of Tom Waits' album (she claims that she doesn't remember but it totally could be her), played in rock bands in Italy, ended up in Fellini's Roma, joined the improv group The Groundlings and then ended up as a DQ on KROQ.Anyways, back to Elvira. The station allowing her to create the image of her character. Originally, she wanted to look like Sharon Tate in The Fearless Vampire Killers, but ended up with the punky and busty look we've all come to know and love.Before the first episode even aired, Normi sued, claiming that Elvira was too close to her character. I'll leave it up to you, dear reader, but they are quite similar. However, her Valley Girl delivery and sarcastic tone was a real difference and Elvira went from local star to pop icon. That all led to this, her first movie.Elvira, Mistress of the Dark quits her job in LA after the station's new owner has a #metoo moment with her. She wants to start an act in Vegas, but needs $50,000. Luckily, her great aunt Morgana has just died and she has to travel to Fallwell, Massachusetts to claim the inheritance.So what does she get? A mansion, a recipe book and Morgana's pet poodle, Algonquin. But once she's in town, she learns that no one is allowed to have fun and she sets out to change everyone's grey demeanor. Oh yeah - and her uncle Vincent just wants the cookbook - which is a book of spells - and he also wants to sacrifice her so that he can take over the world. Thus, magic battles ensue, Algonquin becomes a rat at one point and the town's morality club gets hit with a sex spell that gets them all arrested for indecent exposure.Fellow Groundling Edie McClurg shows up as one of the villains, as does former Grease and Taxi heartthrob Jeff Conaway. Other Groundlings in the film are Lynne Marie Stewart, Deryl Carroll, Joseph Arias, Tress MacNeille and John Paragon.Scripted by Sam Egan and Paragon, who is better known as Jambi and Pterri from his Pee-Wee's Playhouse days, along with Peterson, this movie's entertainment level will depend on how much you love puns and Elvira.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
7,Coventry,A D-Cup full of B-Camp,5,16 January 2010,"The first celebrity crushes I remember having as a child were on Morticia Adams from the ""The Addams Family"" and TV-show hostess Vampira from Ed Wood's film ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" (and yes, I was a completely normal child). Unfortunately I was never too familiar with Elvira, even though she's pretty much a campy knock-off of them both and her TV-work belongs more to my generation. Her show ""Movie Macabre"" never aired here in Europe, however, and I never really bothered to seek out her long-feature films because they look so  silly. This is thus my first real acquaintance with Elvira and, even though it certainly isn't the worst film I've ever seen, I can't say I regret having waited so long. Mrs. Cassandra ""Elvira"" Peterson, who also co-wrote the screenplay for the film, undoubtedly knows her cinematic trash and clearly treasures devotion for B-movies, but the film itself unfortunately is just a gigantically juvenile farce focusing on her very own bosom (which is quite impressive notwithstanding) instead of a cool tribute to genre movies. Elvira's offensively witty one-liners and revealing outfits actually take the attention away from the inexistent and mundane plot. When Elvira gets fired from her TV job in Los Angeles, she finally hopes to start her very own show in Las Vegas, but she needs 50k$ for that to happen. But then she gets a letter announcing her great aunt has died and Elvira's name is mentioned in the will. She arrives in a traditional little New England town, where her appearance and behavior promptly shocks the puritan and conservative local population, only to find out she inherited a hideous old house, a cookbook and a poodle. Whilst hanging around waiting for her broken down car, Elvira befriends the younger generation of Fallwell and discovers that her deceased aunt was actually a good witch who wanted to prevent her malignant brother Vincent Talbot from obtaining her magic powers. The first half of ""Mistress of the Dark"" is just boob jokes and nothing else. The second half tries to be a little more involving, with a dumb but funny cooking interlude, an exciting edition of the yearly Fallwell summer picnic and a genuine old-fashioned New England with hunt. Besides Peterson herself, this film benefices from a pretty solid ensemble cast and everyone delivers performances that are not worthy of the movie, in fact. William Morgan Sheppard is awesome as the wicked Uncle Vincent, and there are neat little roles as well for Susan Kellerman, Edie McClurg and Pat Crawford Brown as the uptight townspeople. The only misfit in the cast is Daniel Greene, who looks incredibly dim-witted as Elvira's love interest. She's clearly too hot to handle for him and he was the Atomic Cyborg!",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
8,Scarecrow-88,"Elvira, Mistress of the Dark",6,16 June 2007,"Elvira(Cassandra Peterson)inherits a manor from her later great aunt who happened to be a practicing witch. That witch's brother, Vincent(William Morgan Sheppard, looking very frail and sickly)wants her book of spells and witchcraft and will turn the New England community against her..he doesn't have to do much because they pretty much loathe Elvira the moment she drives her black ""deathmobile""(quite a ""kickass"" vehicle..those who have seen this flick will get the little pun)into their little village.The premise on paper seems funny enough. Elvira, a hostess of a public domain cable outlet who hosts bad Roger Corman-type creature features, entering a quaint, religiously rooted community turning it on it's head. There's no doubt Peterson was a sexy Gothic goddess blessedly endowed with a bosom and bottom to match..and the filmmakers take every chance they can get to parody her image. I think that's what comic gold gets mined the most..her image in parody. But, after thirty or so minutes, the joke grows stale and the film descends into a trite, silly exercise in witchcraftian hocus pocus with poor Sheppard stuck in the robe and demonic make-up shooting out flames from his mouth and eyes as Elvira runs for her life. The village even attempt to burn her at the stake as a witch. It's really a tired comedy after a while..running out of steam when the train was almost out before leaving the station.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
9,Hey_Sweden,"""Do you smoke?"" ""I guess we'll find out soon enough.""",6,6 December 2014,"""Elvira: Mistress of the Dark"" is pretty harmless stuff, an unmemorable but lightly enjoyable horror spoof. If it does anything well, that's the way that it showcases the talents of its star, the still-very-sexy-after-all-these-years Cassandra Peterson. Here she gets to bring her popular character to the big screen in this amiable vehicle. It's never exactly scary, but it's not trying to be, either. Admittedly, it is very silly, but it's hard to imagine anybody going into this expecting anything different. The cast plays the material for all that it's worth.Cassandra co-wrote the script, with her fellow Groundlings castmate John Paragon and Sam Egan. The idea is that TV horror host Elvira loses her job and desperately needs money in order to put on a Vegas production. Wouldn't you know it, a relative dies, a great aunt named Morgana, who lived in a small town named Falwell. Elvira shakes up the ultra conservative nature of this place, which is loathe to permit people to actually have fun. Ultimately, she must deal with a variety of nemeses: stuck up Patty (Susan Kellermann), local busybody Chastity Pariah (ever lovable Edie McClurg), and her own great uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard). Vincent wants to get his hands on the book that Elvira inherited; Elvira thinks it's just a boring old recipe book but Vincent knows different.Cassandra is full aware of her greatest assets, with dozens of breast jokes for the occasion. She's as fun as she's ever been playing this character, fully embracing the campy approach and its loving mockery of low budget horror. The special effects are generally quite amusing, especially the pot monster. Daniel Greene is perfectly likable as Elviras' hunky nice guy love interest Bob Redding, and there's a number of familiar faces in this supporting cast: Kris Kamm, Ira Heiden, William Duell, Jeff Conaway, Frank Collison, Kurt Fuller, and Hugh Gillin. Buffs will be pleased to note the use of Roger Cormans' ""It Conquered the World"" as it gets mocked during the opening minutes. All in all, the movie moves at an adequate pace and is pleasant enough.Six out of 10.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
10,poolandrews,"""I'm never working for that sleaze-ball again... I have to find another sleaze-ball."" Watchable comedy.",6,28 December 2005,"Elvira, Mistress of the Dark starts with cable TV horror show hostess Elvira (Cassandra Peterson who also co-wrote) having a run in with her new boss Earl Hooter (Lee McLaughlin) & getting herself fired. However Elvira doesn't care as she is about to star in her own show in Las Vegas, that is until her manager Manny (Charles Woolf) says she needs to raise $50,000 of the production costs herself. Elvira thinks she's screwed, that is until she learns that her great aunt Morgana has recently died & left her something in her will. Elvira senses money so heads for the small town of Fallwell in Massachusettes where Morgana lived. Once there Elvira discovers that she inherits Morgana's house, dog & cookbook. With no money Elvira decides to stick around & sell the house but the conservative locals think Elvira is immoral, cheap & bad for the town so lead by the righteous Chastity Pariah (Edie McClurg) they start a campaign to oust her from Fallwall. Meanwhile Elvira's evil Satan worshipping uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard) is plotting to get his hands on Elvira's cookbook ,which is in fact a book of powerful spells, by any means necessary...Directed by James Signorelli I thought Elvira, Mistress of the Dark was a decent watchable family comedy horror. I have to state straight away that I am perhaps at a disadvantage as here in the UK we have no exposure to the character Elvira unlike in the States where I think she gave introductions to horror films, right? Anyway I'm not sure as we don't, & never had, have anything like that here & I have never seen the Elvira character in anything before this. The script by Sam Egan, John Paragon & Peterson is silly & really plays the comedy elements up, I'd have perhaps preferred the horror angle to come through a bit more, I mean wasn't she a horror film hostess? Having said that it provides fair entertainment & a some mildly amusing moments here & there & at least it knows what it is & has no aspirations to be anything else other than a collection of puns, boob jokes, sexual innuendo & slapstick. As a whole Elvira, Mistress of the Dark works quite well with likable character's, just enough horror to maintain my interest & Elvira herself is pretty charismatic, very sexy in her skin tight low cut dress, high heels & I wouldn't mind her introducing my horror films. Look out for her Las Vegas show at the end where she twirls some tassel's attached to her breasts, even managing one at a time.Director Signorelli keeps things moving at a nice pace, the jokes & puns come thick & fast & it never becomes dull or boring. There is one effective jump scene that involves a slimy creature that feels like it belongs in a different film. Forget about any violence, someone has their hand cut off with an axe & Elvira throws her high heeled shoe at someone & the heel becomes impaled in their forehead! I did think he overdid the sentimentality a little at the mushy feel good ending though.With a healthy budget of about $7,500,000 I must admit I'm not sure where all the money went, there are few special effects, no big name actors or huge action scenes. Anyway, it's well made & Elvira's spooky house, inside & out, looks cool which probably cost a few quid to make. The acting is OK & everyone comes across as likable enough, Elvira obviously steals the show with her outfits & attitude.Elvira, Mistress of the dark is a nice enough way to pass 95 odd minutes & offers a few amusing moments. A lot of the jokes feel dated & the overall story is weak but I still think it's worth a watch.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
11,view_and_review,Bewitching with her Breasts,5,2 March 2020,"I can cross this off my list. I watched it, didn't like it, time to move on. If I were rating Elvira's boobs they'd be a 10, but because I'm rating the movie, in which the boobs were heavily featured, I can't rate it higher than a 5. The movie was one long running gag of double entendres and bad puns. It was goth sexy without sex, not that that would've made it any better.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
12,Uriah43,Fairly Entertaining,6,4 March 2014,"In desperate need of money ""Elvira"" (Cassandra Peterson) is elated to discover that she has been named as a beneficiary in her Great Aunt Morgana's will. So she leaves Hollywood and drives to Fallwell, Massachusetts to see what she will get. Upon arriving there she learns that she inherits the house, a dog and a cookbook which Great Aunt Morgana's brother ""Vincent Talbott"" (William Morgan Sheppard) badly wants. Along with that she also inherits the enmity of the local town elders who consider her to be a bad influence upon the residents of the town. Anyway, rather than detailing the entire plot I will just say that for a cheap and trashy type of film this turned out to be fairly entertaining. I especially liked the performance of Cassandra Peterson who seemed to fit her role to perfection. That said however, I should probably also mention that this film may not suit everybody's taste. For example, although Cassandra Peterson was nominated for a Saturn Award as ""Best Actress"" she was also nominated for a Razzie Award as ""Worst Actress"" as well. Likewise, while the movie received a nomination as ""Best Film"" at the International Fantasy Film Awards it was also nominated for ""Worst Picture"" at the Hastings Bad Cinema Society's 11th Stinkers Bad Movie Awards. In short, some people will apparently like it and some people won't. Again, it's deliberately cheap and trashy and those who don't enjoy movies that have off-color jokes and gags of a sexual nature might not want to watch this particular kind of film. All things considered I rate it as slightly above average.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark

But once the locals get an eyeful Elvira, all hell breaks loose.....This is one of those cult movies that you either get, and go with, or hate with a vengeance. The film obviously has a set demographic, and underneath all its glamour, it's just another fish out of water comedy, but with a sassy edge.There is no denying its a film full of twaddle, balderdash, and piffle, but for heavens sake, its a lot of fun, in that cheesy eighties way.Elvira could be anyone's queen for the night, and again, there is a particular orientation who lap this sort of female character up, and she knows this, playing on every innuendo in the book. She is likable, but not too annoying, as one would expect from her garish wardrobe.The townsfolk all hate her at first, and the youngsters love her, and before all is good, it goes very bad for Elvira, but as always, you know all will be well come the end.There is a subplot about a cookbook, that can render the holder very powerful, song and dance numbers, a wonderful reference to Carrie, and it all ends with a fight with rings, but it all works in a camp, silly kind of way.Guaranteed to brighten your day.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
14,Wuchakk,Amusing comedy with Elvira,7,4 October 2015,"Released in 1988, ""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark"" stars Cassandra Peterson as the zany title character who moves from Hollywood to Falwell, Massachusetts, where she inherits an old, creepy mansion. Elvira is a hit with the youths in town and makes a couple friends, but the majority find her offensive and want her out. Meanwhile her uncle is obsessed with getting a ""recipe book"" from the mansion for some diabolical purpose.Cassandra was 36 during filming and looks great throughout (as do her stunt doubles). Ellen Dunning (Robin) gets an honorable mention on the female front. While only half the humor works (the other half being groan-inducing) there are several laugh-out-loud sequences, like the parodying of The Price Is Right and ""Flashdance."" Christians might find the portrayal of the intolerant townsfolk offensive, but (1.) the movie's a comedy/parody, not a depiction of real-life; anyone who takes this seriously needs to visit the psych ward; (2.) the movie amusingly denounces counterfeit religiosity, i.e. sterile legalism, and not Christendom itself; and (3.) the ending pretty much makes up for the negative portrayal.What I find somewhat annoying is the continual wisecracking that pegs Elvira as a loose woman, to put it nicely. While her long black dress reveals mega-cleavage and the upper part of one leg, it's not exactly prostitute attire; plus the story shows Elvira interested in only ONE guy, which hardly constitutes a loose woman.BOTTOM LINE: This is a worthwhile turn-off-your-brain-and-have-a-good-time flick with Elvira. Fans of cartoony horror comedies like 2006' ""Monster Night"" and Scooby Doo should appreciate it.The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in Hollywood/Burbank/Los Angeles.GRADE: B",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
15,Mr-Fusion,More than an eyeful,7,12 October 2018,"Embarrassing confession: I didn't know Elvira had her own movie until last week. Yeah, I know, that must've been some rock I've been living under. And it's exactly the kind of movie you'd expect her to star in. Stuffed with every adolescent boob joke you can think of, playfully ribald and infused with self-awareness. That's really what makes it all work. Cassandra Peterson's in on every last joke, fully committed to her character; equal parts vapid and titillating. She does more than just pose in that dress, and as tenuously clasped as it is, some of it is border-line stuntwork. There's a YouTube video with Elvira teaching her audience how to carve a pumpkin, and it's a perfect example of how Peterson melds wit with sex appeal (which is exactly why I love her; I hold to the belief that she'd make a fantastic bowling partner). And it's nicely translated to the big screen. If you're looking for cheap gags with capable comedic actors, then you've come to the right place.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
16,Red-Barracuda,Fun Elvira vehicle,7,3 November 2021,"The only reason to catch this one is to see TV horror hostess Elvira in action in a movie. If you are at all interested in a pneumatic goth woman going around barking her lines and chewing up the scenery at every opportunity, while wearing ultra-revealing clobber, then you are in the demographic this film was aiming at. I feel mercilessly targeted. In it, Elvira comes into a healthy inheritance from a distant aunt and then a bunch of stuff happens. The upshot is a comedy-horror with the emphasis on comedy, its basic but gets the job done but its Elvira we're here for, right?",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
17,thesar-2,About an Hour and a HalfToo Short,9,17 July 2013,"I will never apologize for absolutely loving the rock-solid hilarious Elvira: Mistress of the Dark feature film. I won't even label it as a ""guilty pleasure;"" I have no guilt in my pleasure in laughing out loud every time I watch this.Actually, it's probably been two decades since I last viewed this and though I remember watching it back then repeatedly, this viewing brought back everything. I could all-but recite every line, every joke and see everything coming two chapters ahead. And that's not a bad thing; I still laughed out loud all over again in a movie that's 25-years-old this September.(And speaking of which – where is the 25th Anniversary BluRay Special Edition for this absolute classic?)It helps that I used to watch her show, about her hosting and commenting on terribly bad and unintentionally hilarious B-movies, live – and watched it for different reasons most boys did my age. It also helps that I transitioned, following her, into Mystery Science Theater 3000. But, none of that accounts for the full-movie she helped write here. In fact, aside from the opening act (the set-up,) a few mentions of movies she likes, a brief live-edition in the midsection and the spoof of making a movie mimicking her B-movies, the movie really stands on its own.Yeah, that didn't come out right. But, what I mentioned was only part of the whole experience. And though it's not entirely based on an original idea, Cassandra Peterson's Elvira has such great wit, delivery and charisma, it makes the old setup fresh and very funny.Elvira's fired from her show (see description above) and lucks out with ""perfect timing"" of her Great Aunt's passing and an inheritance that might fund her Las Vegas' Flamingo show. (Which, by the way, I would die to see)Breaking down, her car that is, in a small, obviously Red State kind of town, she must spend a few days reinventing the locales to her ""big"" – ha – city ways.To add in the elements of her B-movie story come to life, there's the evil Uncle who needs a witchy book of dear, ole Great Aunt to have supreme power. Will Elvira, and her new followers, be able to stop such a warlock?In truth, and as stated it's been approximately 20 years since I last saw this, I didn't know I would still roll with laughter. Also, I didn't think I'd see her as a hypocrite: constantly she flirts, flaunts her hugeattributes and then bashes whoever makes a sexual move toward her. I did think she was a hypocrite, until it made sense: She was mocking, very cleverly, indeed, women who either have big breasts, or buy them, make advances and then shuns those who take the bait. Smart girl. Cassandra, that is.Anyhoo, this movie meant a lot to me growing up. It defined a lot of my own humor and I still, to this day, use the lines in my every day routines. There are so many to mention, but the number one quote I unabashedly repeat constantly:""Hey, does anyone know what that movie was about? I'll tell yah what it was about: it was about an hour and a half too long!"" - Elvira(Technically, when I don't like a movie, or just wanna make someone laugh, and they ask me: ""What was that movie about anyways?"" I respond: ""'Bout an hour and a half too long!"" Or, whatever the length was.)If you liked those small-town, road trip antic films, like To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar, you'd love this. I believe it holds up strongly today and sadly, so do a lot of the ignorant behaviors initially shown here in this film.And until next time, (un)pleasant dreams.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
18,bensonmum2,It's the same joke over and over and over.....,5,25 April 2005,"Elvira moves to a small town to claim her inheritance - an old, rundown house. Although most of the townspeople don't approve, the kids in town are only too happy to help her fix-up her house. Elvira finds what she believes to be a cookbook in the house. Her uncle offers to buy it from her, but she won't sell. The book, it seems, contains more than ordinary recipes. It's a book of spells that Elvira must learn to use to save herself and the town.I've seen this movie several times over the years. And with each viewing, I find myself enjoying it less and less. Elvira is a one note character - boob jokes. And, while some of the jokes are funny the first couple of times, the jokes get tired real quick. Without the comedy, Elvira becomes little more than a bad actress in a very revealing dress.The brightest spot in the movie is Edie McClurg. She's one of those people that can make me laugh regardless of how bad the material may be. When you see her, she's the exact opposite of what you expect a comedian to look like. And she uses that to her advantage here playing the holier than though Chastity Pariah.Even though Elvira, Mistress of the Dark may not be as good in my eyes as I once thought it was, it's still miles better than Elvira's second movie, Elvira's Haunted Hills - another one joke movie.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
19,lost-in-limbo,"""It's OK. My appearance is kind of a shock to everybody.""",5,9 October 2009,"I never saw any of the TV shows, but we know where the eyes will be heading, but it's the character's main draw-card and this aspect is played for the laughs. 'Elvira' is light-headed in its context, but quite low-brow with its humour, as a sizzling siren Cassandra Peterson laced up in her spunky Gothic wardrobe resembles a Mae West with her sharp-witted (although not always funny, but they're either bad and good) wisecracks. This film is pretty much a living parody, as it follows horror TV show hostess Elvira quit her job in the dream of performing in Las Vegas but to keep that show alive, she needs money to pay for it. She learns she will be receiving an inheritance from her deceased auntie in a quaint, conservative little rural town. Hoping for money, she ends up with the house, dog and a family cook book (or is it just a cook book?). Which for some reason her uncle Vincent would do anything to get his hands on that book. Its loopy camp of a very one-joke kind, which patterns itself into contrived silliness. It moves by fast enough, even though it does become starved of gags due to simply relying on its same-old collection of its 'fish out of water' gags of a performance that's more than just an act. Director James Signorelli colourfully spruce handling uses cheeky references and builds a certain likable charm. William Morgan Sheppard and a dynamically ripe Edie McClurg are quite fun their roles in what you can call the meanies of the film. In the end it knows what it is, and purposely keeps it to that; simple-minded, crude and carefree kitsch.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
20,TheMovieDiorama,Elvira: Mistress of the Dark naively blossoms as the campy witch that rules over cult classics.,7,11 October 2019,"The words ""cult"" and ""classic"" have always made me sceptical. My sudden apprehension that I may not understand or appreciate the gradual following a certain feature has acquired over time. None more so than Elvira. Both a horror and LGBT icon, this comedy horror was slated upon its initial release. But since then, many have flocked to it with its ever increasing popularity. Where do I stand amidst the spook-thirsty yet ""boobilicious"" crowd? Well, suffice to say I had an absolute blast. Hand me that recipe book, because of I've got some euphemisms to reel off! Horror hostess Elvira quits her job and plans to open an act in Las Vegas, to which she claims the inheritance of her recently deceased great-aunt which coincidentally will fund her act.Upon the first ten minutes, much like Elvira I had an inclination of déjà vu. 'To Wong Foo...', another LGBT classic, followed the same narrative premise as Elvira years later. Alternative person(s) venturing into a traditionally conservative town where they eventually extend their unconventional personality upon the conventional, slowly opening their closed minds. And it somewhat cemented the ingenuity of this structure, because the most relatable hilarity is when the townsfolk are oblivious to such unorthodox behaviour. Subconsciously it's also delivering character development for everyone. In this case, Elvira comes to terms with her descendants whom have passed down the knowledge of witchcraft. The entirety of Fallwell, Massachusetts (obviously...), coming to terms with Elvira's eccentricities. And punk rock poodle Algonquin is rocking that pink dye.The real bright light amidst the eternal darkness of the underworld however, is the comedy. As with every review, I state I have no sense of humour. And it's true. I don't. So it's with a huge enthusiastic grin on my face that I have the pleasure in stating that Elvira was absolutely hilarious. The plethora of sexual innuendos, euphemisms and borderline harassment all work. Signorelli's light yet buoyant tone complements the facetious script that wholly acknowledges the sumptuous campiness. The camera consistently zooming in on Elvira's voluptuous bosom. The flamboyant fourth wall breaks as she seductively winks at the camera. Even the effortless euphemisms that she naturally blurts out unintentionally. Whilst adding sexuality to her character, the screenplay never exploits Elvira's curvaceous figure to the point where she is viewed as a diminished object. She is always in control. She knows exactly what she's doing, for example shoving her breasts and buttocks in front of teenagers to convince them to help out with the decorating (classic Elvira...). And she knows how to make me laugh. It's the inner child within me that sneakily chuckles whenever oral sex is mentioned. I'm a mess!None of this though would've been nearly as effective if it wasn't for Elvira herself. Peterson was enigmatic. An absolute pleasure to watch her steal the spotlight and completely own it. Heck, even the conclusive stage show that, more often than not forced me to cringe behind my cushion, was lavishly personalised by her performance. The seamless comedic timing, exaggerated bodily movements and use of sexualisation has secured the character as one of the greatest.The third act tonal shift from comedy to tragedy unfortunately doesn't work, and attempts to conclude an underdeveloped story that no one particularly cared for. Sheppard was decent as the antagonistic warlock, with some fantastic prosthetics later on, but then Greene is pushed forward more as the love interest and his acting is beyond mediocre to say the least. Typical B-movie schlock I suppose. Still, this Mistress of the Dark did quite the opposite by shining a new light on a potential personal classic. Camp, sexy and, above all, hilarious. Elvira had me under a spell.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
21,Tweetienator,Classic 80s Horror Comedy,8,24 July 2020,"Elvira: Mistress of the Dark is one of those great horror comedy gems of the 80s with a high trash factor - Return of the Living Dead, House, Re-Animator, Beetlejuice to name a few belong rightfully to that list. Cassandra Peterson plays her iconic role as a kind of goth/heavy metal witch chick most delicious. Thumps up to this one. Also strongly recommended: Elvira's Movie Macabre, a horror TV series were you get some trashy B movies (horror/sci fi) featured, interrupted and spiced up by comments and jokes by the hostess Elvira.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
22,BaronBl00d,Definitely a Double D Cup Here,6,19 June 2012,"Well, this movie is about Elvira and her breasts more than anything else. Take the references and jokes and leers and squeezes and ogling out and 60% of the film is gone just like that. The film opens with Elvira on the set of her television show when just as she loses her job for refusing to play horsey to the new station owner, she discovers she has inherited something in Falwell, Mass.(Nice use of Jerry Falwell's name here too by the way!). Well, the town is uber ""moral"" and Elvira is...Elvira. Eventually she discovers she has spell powers, etc... and battles her uncle for her life and property. In between we get all kinds of silly humour such as a dog with a punk hairstyle, an orgiastic picnic with Edie McClurg(need I say more?), a rather tame and pedestrian romance with some imbecile in town, Elvira quipping one-liners like the sleazy Oscar Wilde of her time, and breasts. more breasts. More cleavage. More suggestive uses for those breasts. We get innuendo by the truckload. Naturally all this makes for a silly and stupid film, but Cassandra Peterson as Elvira is indeed more than two large fleshy orbs - she has other talents. She is funny. She can act - at least for a film like this. She has a great screen persona. Sure, the sophomoric obsession with her bazooms, her bosom, her jugs, her boobs, her mammaries, her ample bounty get a bit tiresome for me(and I assure you I am not only a big fan but a dedicated one with regard to those assets), but they are funny an not really made to be anything other than that. There is absolutely nothing erotic here. Elvira is having fun and likes people to see her - much of her - having fun. There are lots of pretty good verbal and visual gags throughout. My favourite is when a letter from a movie marquee hits Elvira in the head. Bob, the dull romantic lead, says, ""How's your head?"" To which Elvira says, ""I've had no complaints.""",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark

I mean, I couldn't get women at my age (I was 9 or 10) so I thought watching Elvira's cleavage was the closet thing to sex.I ended up having a great time with this cult classic about horror comedy, Halloween parties, sassy humor, and some sexy evil displayed by Elvira.They just don't make movies like this anymore... It had the feeling of an amateur effort mixed with a late night cable talk show host style. The truth is that it generated plenty of fans because of it's humor and the ability to perform by Cassandra. This is classic that reminds me of the good days of USA Up All Night.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark

25,kevin_robbins,This is a fun and nostalgic movie that is definitely worth a viewing,7,27 July 2021,"Elvira: Mistress of the Dark (1988) is a movie I recently rewatched on Shudder. The storyline follows your favorite horror late night personality as she looks to start a new job in Vegas; unfortunately for her, she needs to front half the bill for the show. Lucky for Elvira a recently passed aunt has died and included her in her will. Is this the big break she needs? This movie is directed by James Signorelli (Police Academy 2) and stars Cassandra Peterson (Pee-Wes's Playhouse), Bill Morey (Death Race 2000), Daniel Greene (Me, Myself & Irene) and Jeff Conaway (Grease). The presentation of Elvira in this was perfect. Peterson was perfect - her script, mannerisms and props (like the car, dog, etc) we're all excellent. There was a lot of witty banter in this as well as some elements that felt very 80s (I think there were 3 montages). The soundtrack is very fun and this movie does a great job of not taking itself too seriously. I also loved seeing her pull into town - you can quickly recognize the Warner Brothers set from Gremlins and Monster Squad in the background. Overall this is a fun and nostalgic movie that is definitely worth a viewing. I'd score this a solid 7/10. Oh yeah, her closing act is excellent.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
26,kirbylee70-599-526179,HAVE A LAUGH,8,6 June 2020,"Horror hosts have been a staple on TV since its early days when packages of old horror movies were put together to be shown on late night television. To this day there are still a wide number of them out there but the heyday of the horror host was the sixties. Then in 1981 a new hostess came along the changed all that. With a curvaceous figure, long black hair, low cut top and a fun sense of humor actress/comedian Cassandra Peterson gave the world Elvira.The character was filled with double entendre, displaying her body in provocative ways and making fun of the movies that were being shown. Loosely based on the character of Vampira, an earlier host, Peterson combined that similar look with a valley girl style that made her unique. It was popular enough that the series was syndicated and released on VHS and she garnered numerous promotional gigs as well. So it was only natural that this character would eventually get a film of her own.ELVIRA MISTRESS OF THE DARK tells the story of Elvira as a horror host who longs to take the stage in Vegas. The problem is she needs $50,000 to produce the show. When the new station owner sexually harasses her she quits and it seems her dreams are over. Then she gets a telegram: her great-aunt Morgana has passed away and she is in the will. Having never met Morgana but not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, she heads to Fallwell, Massachusetts to collect.When she arrives she finds a less than welcome reception. Fallwell is a town stuck in the fifties complete with a theater that only shows G rated movies and a gaggle of gossipers who find Elvira's appearance outrageous. But Elvira is not one to accept the norms and she finds a place to stay until the will is read. Needless to say she is stunned when she inherits Morgana's house. Even more so when she gets to the house to find it run down and in need of attention.With the help of the town's young people, mostly guys attracted by her ""assets"", she soon has the house looking better. Unfortunately the local real estate agent is more interested in what he can get out of her than what she can get out of him. The one possibility for her is a recipe book that her great-uncle Vincent (W. Morgan Sheppard) seems interested in and willing to pay for.What Elvira isn't aware of is that the book is actually a book of spells and that her great-aunt Morgana was a witch who kept it from Vincent, a powerful warlock intent on doing the world harm. Elvira had been sent away as a young child but has it in her to become as powerful a witch as Morgana and save Fallwell from Vincent and themselves.Fueled by the same off the wall humor that her TV show had the movie offers plenty of laughs, most of them based around the anything goes appearance and attitude of Elvira herself. The reality is that in the long run Elvira is mostly harmless and fun loving than anything else and that humor is no more offensive than a mild dirty joke you wouldn't feel uncomfortable telling your parents. It's all done in good humor and only those who would be looking for something to be offended by would do so.Released in 1988 the film was supposed to kick off a series of films but failed to click enough to do so. It didn't stop Peterson from continuing to make appearances as Elvira and to continue that career though. To this day she still makes appearance across the country as Elvira and fans clamor to see her.The movie may not be Oscar worthy material but there is a certain amount of fun to it. It's not meant to be taken seriously any more so than the character herself. Instead it sets out to entertain and give you something to laugh at and it succeeds more often than fails in that respect.Arrow Video is pulling out all stops on their release of the film starting with a 4k scan from original film elements making the release look better than ever. And like every great Arrow release there are plenty of extras on hand as well starting with an introduction to the film by director James Signorelli. Also included are a 2017 audio commentary track with Signorelli hosted by Fangoria editor emeritus Tony Timpone, a 2017 audio commentary track with Patterson Lundquist the webmaster of elviramistressofthedark. com and judge of the US TV show ""The Search for the Next Elvira"", archival audio commentary with actors Cassandra Peterson, Edie McClurg and writer John Paragon, ""Too Macabre - The Making of Elvira: Mistress of the Dark a newly-revised 2018 version of the feature length documentary on the film, ""Recipe for Terror: The Creation of the Pot Monster"" a newly-revised featurette about the concept and design of the pot monster from the film as well as other special effects, original storyboards, an extensive image gallery, the original US theatrical and teaser trailers, a reversible sleeve with original and newly commissioned artwork by Sara Deck and for the first pressing only an illustrated collector's booklet featuring writing by Kat Ellinger and Patterson Lundquist.For fans of Elvira and this film in particular this will be the version to add to your collection.

Its cheesy, poorly acted and just downright stupid at times- but its just so dang enjoyable I have to give it a pass. Thanks to the charming Elvira actress herself, Cassandra Peterson, this film is incredibly fun to watch. Peterson knows exactly what kind of film she is making, and makes the most out of it, whether it be hilarious running gags, the quite often boob joke, or just pure insanity- Elvira Mistress of the Dark clearly wouldn't work at all without her (if that wasn't obvious by the title alone). The film plays out like a cross between Pee-Wee's Big Adventure and Wayne's World if both adopted witchcraft somewhere down the line. The plot is thin, but the antics are fun to watch ensue- and you can't help but feel excited scene after scene wondering what kooky thing is gonna happen next. Yes, it can feel a bit one-note at times, but Elvira: Mistress of the Dark is as fun as it is stupid- and honestly just a great fun time at the movies.

29,questl-18592,Pleasantville 2: Elvira's Revenge,4,10 January 2021,"As a movie, Elvira: Mistress of the Dark is pretty much what you'd expect from the poster. It's a goofy, goth comedy about a over-sexualized character and her conflict with a local town of straight laced squares. Truthfully, this didn't really age all that well. The jokes that she employed back in the lates 80s can be pretty cringe now with our more modern lense but I can't help but feel a certain nostalgia for this. It's a B-movie romp that I remember from my youth and part of that enjoyment is lingering on even though I know from a practical standpoint this isn't very good. Elvira is just a fun character for me and I do get some enjoyment out of the old, overly stereotyped performances.Again, not saying this is great, it just rides that nostalgia just right for me. With that said, unless you happen to have the same nostalgia look at it, I doubt many people are going to enjoy this at this point, much less if they came in having never seen it. I think the only way to save this would be to look at it as a super campy experience to laugh at as well as with and to that end I can dig it, even with all of it's shortcomings.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark

31,Vomitron_G,"She's hot, vulgar... and out for money!",7,10 January 2010,"Since the start of her career in the 70's and vastly throughout the exuberant 80's, Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) has grown into a modest icon and genuine cult figure in the world of horror & bad monster movies. While Ms. Peterson has taken on various supporting roles in motion pictures, covering a wide variety in genres, it was her TV-character Elvira that brought her the most fame. Part of her charm – and respect from the fans – lies in the fact she never turned her back on the horror genre that made her famous (unlike many other big name actors & actresses that like to distantiate themselves from their ""early"" work). I've seen only bits & pieces of her TV performances, but her cameo role in Ghoultown's recent tribute song ""Mistress of the Dark"" really encouraged me to check out more of her stuff. One thing had been clear to me already long before this music video: Over the years, Elvira had become a force of influence herself by the time the mid-80's came around.And in 1988, after films like ""Fright Night"" and ""TerrorVision"" incorporated homages to and spoofs on her TV-work, it finally happened: ""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark"", the motion picture. Now, I had seen the trailer for it already back in the VHS rental days, but it took me until last week to finally see the actual film. A few years ago, I did manage to watch ""Elvira's Haunted Hills"" (made in 2001), but for some reason it didn't impress me all that much. Was it really that forgettable, or should I give it another watch? I actually really do feel like re-watching it now, as this first Elvira film from '88 really convinced me. Though perhaps partly responsible for making this film work, might be Sam Egan and John Paragon with their contributions to the script, there really is no way to deny it: Cassandra Peterson has a great feel for comedy (she also co-wrote the screenplay).When Elvira learns she's one of the beneficiaries of a Great Aunt (she never heard of before), she takes it as the long cherished opportunity to start up her own show in Las Vegas. Out to claim her rightfully inherited money, she travels to a quiet New England town. But the uptight townspeople of Falwell are in for a treat. In less than no time she manages to shock and insult all noteworthy inhabitants of the conservative little town with her (often unintentionally) provocative behaviour. To make things worse, her inheritance turns out not to be what she expected: A rundown mansion, a cookbook and a poodle. But what she doesn't know, and her evil uncle Vincent Albot does, is that her Great Aunt was a witch, and the cookbook contains recipes to concoct the most hellishly dark powers imaginable. And if you haven't turned off the movie yet by the time Elvira has cooked up her first dish from the recipe-book, then rest assured, you're going to sit out this ride with a smile on your face.It's surprising how a script rigged together with boob-jokes, witty one-liners, movie references, inside jokes and bade taste merriment also manages to tell a coherent story. Simple, of course, but coherent. While other movies, heavily relying on gag-like situations, often make you loose track of the story completely (like the ""Naked Gun"" films, for example), this film doesn't. A lot of horror-comedies were being produced during the 80's, but not a lot of them actually worked. Let alone a horror-spoof that doesn't derail at some point (""Killer Party"", although I'm grateful for this one going completely bonkers during the finale) or becomes too tedious too quickly (""Saturday the 14th""). Although ""Elvira"" is more comedy than horror, it doesn't loose track of what it's doing and consistently builds up towards a mildly grotesque finale, complete with a supernatural showdown in the streets of Falwell between newborn witch Elvira and evil uncle wizard Talbot, including a real honest-to-god witch hunt and Elvira's very own burn-at-the-stake moment.I'm telling you, there's no power in hell that could make this movie unfunny. One of the first giggles I got was during the opening credits already, when Daniel Greene's name appeared. Daniel who? Oh yes, I recognized his name (and later on his dim-witted macho-face). How can one not forget Daniel Greene once you've seen... ""Atomic Cyborg aka Fists of Steel""! But if you haven't seen ""Atomic Cyborg"", then I'm sorry, but you won't be able to laugh with his face in this one. And on a side-note: I never could have imagined Elvira looking this cool while ignorantly driving away from a gas station. Even Robert Rodriguez could not have made that shot look any better.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark

33,gftbiloxi,Tremendous Fun,7,10 June 2007,"Cassandra Peterson originally created Elvira as the television hostess of late-night horror films, and when the character proved unexpectedly popular she suddenly found herself doing everything from beer commercials to spots on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. She reached the peak of her popularity in the late 1980s, and the film ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK was the result.The plot is flyweight. Television horror film hostess Elvira dreams of success in Las Vegas. When her great aunt dies, she travels to New England in hopes that the estate will provide enough money to back a stage show; she is disappointed to find she has inherited a rundown house, a poodle, and an old book. It happens that the town is puritanical beyond all description, and she provokes righteous indignation everywhere she goes. It also happens that her great uncle is secretly an evil warlock and very intent on laying hands on ""the old book."" Throw in a few teenagers, a stud muffin, and a hateful woman with falsies and there you go.No one would accuse it of being a cinematic masterpiece, and it does drag now and then. But Cassandra Peterson demonstrates tremendous flair from start to finish: squirmy, sexy, and mixing lowbrow humor with flashes of sharp comedy, she dances through the film like a ringmaster in a circus of corny and often self-mocking jokes. From a FLASHDANCE disaster to witchcraft craziness, she is never less than wildly entertaining. It's a tremendous amount of fun, and the film's conclusion even manages to generate considerable suspense. Will Elvira best her evil uncle and save the day? Well, I don't want to give anything away, so let's just say you'll have a lot of fun finding out.DVD quality is okay and there's little in the way of bonus material, but if you're in the mood for something silly this one is sure to answer the urge.

34,aesgaard41,"They're....I Mean,She's Back",9,23 March 2001,"There are two things that I like about Elvira, and they're both bigger than she is and she keeps them covered up: her wit and her talent. A movie is the best thing to show off how funny she can be or how she commands attention. Looking like a combined clone of Morticia Adams and Anna Nicole Smith, she inherits a distant relative's estate only to discover that she is really the heiress of the occult. The comedy in this movie is the best thing about it, but it could have been a lot more scary and chilling. It's mostly a campy fare with as many bad horror movie references in it such as the rioting mob or the fleeing heroine who trips and stumbles on her heels. My favorite part is when she uses her marvelous endowments to break the chains keeping her locked in the cemetary. The ending is sappingly sweet as if it were written by the Bradys, but the Las Vegas act at the end seems too grandiose for this type of movie.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark

She hosted and presented classic American horror films, many of them campy, while providing her own quips and humorous remarks. Actress Cassandra Peterson has to this date ridden on that success. In 1988, her first film was released. Playing herself, she's stuck hosting monster movie shows but longs for her own show in Las Vegas and make big money. Her agent Manny proves a disappointment. It's not long before she inherits a mansion from a deceased relative, a pet dog and a book of recipes. She comes to claim her inheritance in a small Nevada town - she was on her way to Vegas and became lost - and soon stirs things up in the sedate community. Outspoken conservative town council woman Chastity Pariah (Edie McClurg) soon sees her as a threat to the decency and values of the small town. Her voluptuous figure and winning personality soon draws the youth of the town. She falls for Bob Redding (Daniel Greene) the town handyman/carpenter, but before any real relationship can bloom, she finds herself in deep trouble. Vincent Talbot (William Morgan Sheppard) an eerie older man who is also set to inherit part of the fortune of Elvira's relative is in fact an age-old sorcerer who has a personal vendetta against Elvira's aunt and Elvira herself. He is aware that the so-called ""recipe book"" is actually a book of powerful magic, a power he wishes to claim for himself. He schemes to bring down Elvira by having the town burn her at the stake. How will Elvira get out of this one ? The movie was no real success at the box office, drawing a crowd of mostly young audiences familiar with the Elvira show on cable. Truth be told, this is a funny and feel-good movie. The script is chalk full of all kinds of jokes, some bad, some good, lots of sexual innuendo, visual jokes and overall campiness i.e. the hilarious last scene in which Elvira has finally got her own strip show in Vegas. This film is a cult classic of sorts, catering to Elvira fans. You couldn't enjoy this film otherwise. It's also a look back at ""pop"" culture of the 80's. Elvira was as much an icon of the 80's as was Alf, Vicky the Robot, Hulk Hogan, Mr. T and Madonna.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
36,tomimt,Funny horror camp,7,18 September 2007,"Elvira, Mistress of The Dark, is a fun, camp horror comedy, in which the fourth wall is broken a couple of times and the jokes often stay below the navel. And the breasts of Cassandra Peterson become a character of their own.Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is stacked horror show hostess, who learns, that she has inherited her aunt Morgana. So she goes to a little town of Fallwell, which is ruled by the most horrendous monster ever to embrace the earth: Morality comity. Elviras boobacious appearance is, of course, too much for the prunes, but the kids of the town get a kick out of her different kind of approach on life. And of course there is even more sinister evil, her uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard), who is after Elvira's mothers book of spells. See, Elvira actually is a real witch, she just doesn't know it. Yet.For what it is, Elvira is quite funny film, even though the script does leave a lot of room for improvement. Most laughs come from the difference between Elvira and the people of good morals, but there are a couple of good visual gags as well. Over all direction is okay, but it never rises to be anything more than that. In all, a good, intentionally campy, comedy. If you like this kind of thing, that is.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark

It seems that a great aunt of hers has died and that she needs to be present for the reading of the will. Anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in Las Vegas, she decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of money.Unfortunately, the place she has to go is the town of Fallwell, Massachusetts. Having to stay a spell due to her car breaking down, she finds out that her great aunt left her 3 things: a house, a dog and a cookbook. The town residents have mixed reactions:the teens like her, the women hate her, and the men lust after her (Although trying to remain moral pillars of the community). Her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle Vincent (W. Morgan Sheppard), because he wants her cookbook. Seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful warlock.The film is actually pretty funny, with Peterson a.k.a. Elvira using her ""endowments"" and sexiness as a joke (""And don't forget, tomorrow we're showing the head with two things... I mean the thing with two heads""). Especially funny as Edie McClurg as Chastity Pariah, the woman that works her hardest to keep the town in line, but ends up looking ridiculous (The picnic scene is the perfect example).

When horror hostess Elvira finds herself the inheritor of her late aunt Morgana's estate, she moves into a large mansion in a small New England town where she clashes with the residents and her evil Uncle Vincent, who is actually a warlock obsessed with obtaining Morgana's spellbook. He plans to kill Elvira and conquer the world, and fuels the townspeople's hostility towards her leading them to arrest her for witchcraft, and attempting to burn her at the stake. It may not be the comedy that re-invented horror comedies, but Elvira's feature film debut despite its mildly raunchy tone and obsession with Peterson's considerable cleavage, is a decent, good-hearted comedy that never takes itself seriously.

What a shock it was to see she (Cassandra Peterson) is a red head and looks nothing like her alter-ego. There is brief scene in this camp classic where she's out of the wig for a flashback...it's very brief.Stuffed full of puns, sexual innuendo, bad jokes, cheap gags and a huge amount of heart. This film hits all the right notes as a classic example of 80's cheese and is worthy of its inclusion as one of the best camp films of the era.Like Elvira, the film never takes itself seriously. Each scene is just another opportunity for her to mug for the camera and make endless - I mean endless - b00b jokes...she invites the viewer to join her in on the fun.High Recommend.Fare thee well.

43,junk-monkey,Goth Mae West,5,1 July 2005,"I'm still not sure I believe my eyes. I just watched a New World movie that had a budget! Opening with footage from Corman stinker ""It Conquered the World"" and containing clips from ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" this simple silly comedy delivers some nice jokes and (for its time) semi-decent special effects - far better than the usual tosh that follows the ""New World Cinema"" logo onto the screen.The story is minimal. Fired from her job presenting crud movies on the TV Elvira, needing to raise 50,000 dollars to take a show to Las Vegas, drives to New England to claim an inheritance. She arrives in the prudish town like a Goth Mae West and finds she has inherited a dilapidated house, a poodle, and a cookery book. The book turns out to be a spell book of incredible power and the only thing stopping Elvira's Evil Great Uncle from ruling the world. Elvira eventually defeats him after nearly being burned as a witch and gets to put on her show in Vegas.OK, a lot of the jokes you've heard before, a lot of them misfire, but they keep coming and the pace never flags and there are some genuinely funny, inventive moments in here. Listen for the noise as Elvira blows the smoke of the top of her gun. It's a classic piece of sound editing that makes a dumb joke funny.

46,Morbius_Fitzgerald,As an overall comedy...its pretty good.,7,1 February 2016,"I came into this film with just the barest of knowledge on who Elvira was. I knew she was a horror host in the 80s and some of the 90s and she took off a lot more than any others did (unless you count MST3K) and...that probably would've been it. So, rather curiously and in a way that I can't really explain why, I decided to watch this to get a firm foundation for her character and maybe her show. In the end, it was quite an enjoyable little film.Okay so the plot will probably sound familiar in one way or another - A horror show host named Elvira quits her job as a horror host at a local TV station after finding out its being bought by a pervert who wants to take sexual advantage of her and wants to start up a show in Vegas but to achieve that, she has to come up with $50 000 and, by coincidence, her Great Aunt has just died and the reading of her will is in a few days in a town thats...conservative, to say the least. She is mostly treated badly from everyone there with the exceptions being the teenagers of the town and the local film theater manager, whose the love interest. And it turns out her inheritance is the house from The Munsters (no joke, its the same house!), a punk rock dog and a recipe book which her only other relative (her Great Uncle) wants to get his hands on, on the grounds that its a spell recipe book and wants to use it to become the ""Master of the Dark"".Okay, whats good here? Well a lot of the jokes do hit the nail in the head, most of the time, in getting a laugh however corny they may be, its a surprisingly creative way to make a film about a horror host, all the actors do well for their parts and its great to just see the film play out. What do I mean by that? A lot of the time Elvira has a ""conspiracy"" planned against her by the head of the town, Chastity Pariah. Maybe its different for some people but the amount of times the supposed ""moral figure"" of the town proves just how insane she is and how Elvira the ""harlot"" is probably one of the few voices of reason in the entire film is just funny to me. My favourite scene is just as Elvira discovers she's a witch and she can do all this, the townsfolk that have all wronged her have a ""morality"" picnic, as a celebration of the fact that they've kept their morals and values in check. She puts in a potion she brewed up which...turns it into an orgy (well as much of an orgy as you can get from an M rating) (also, while I'm doing this, as much as it will be hard to believe, considering Elvira's reputation the whole 'turning the picnic into an orgy was completely by accident!) and the very next scene is of a town meeting where they constantly blame the other person they were with for coming on to them and being ""sex crazed deviants"". Again, your opinion may vary on how funny that is.Whats bad? I'm not going to act like there isn't anything. Sometimes the fantasy sequences are a bit tedious, some of the jokes didn't quite make it with a few leaving me groaning but the worst thing, for me at least, was that after everything's done, spoiler alert, Elvira achieves her dream of going to Vegas and we see what her act is. Which goes on for 4 minutes and while the film wasn't awful by this stage my reaction was along the lines of ""Movie...your over. Why are we focusing on this when its not even funny?""So is it for everyone? No. The best way to describe this film is ""imagine if Hocus Pocus (1993) and The Addams Family (1991) had a child that happened to star one of the most successful horror hosts ever"". Get that image in your head, add a tonne of cheese to it (yes, even more than either of those two films had combined) and thats this movie.

This was meant to be the pilot vehicle for Elvira and was so successful that it was picked up by the NBC Network. They filmed a pilot for a television series to feature the busty babe in black but unfortunately the sit-com never made it past the pilot stage due to it's sexual references. This film however, is very amusing. Elvira is the modern-day Chesty Morgan and the queen of the one-liners. This film was followed up a few years later by the abysmal ""Elvira's Haunted Hills"" which was meant to be a take-off of the old Roger Corman movies but falls flat on it's face.

She is planning on performing a show in Vegas when she gets the news that she has to come up with a substantial amount of money to do the show. What's worse is her new boss is not shy when it comes to sexual harassment. Elvira then receives a telegram from Massachusetts stating that her great aunt died. Thinking she is going to inherit a fortune, Elvira travels to Massachusetts, but soon learns that she inherited an old house that is in desperate need of updating. She also butts heads with most of the town. There is an evil uncle trying to get a spell book that belonged to Elvira's great aunt. There is a romantic rival and others who want Elvira gone as soon as possible.This is definitely worth a watch as it is fun and entertaining all the way through.

49,onnanob2,Q: Can Elvira carry a feature film? A: YES!,8,31 August 2002,"""Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark"" is a sort of ""Harper Valley P.T.A."" with touches of the supernatural. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) walks off her job as television horror movie hostess after the new station's owner gets fresh with her. She's now relying on a Las Vegas show to carry her through, but learns she needs to come up with more money to get the show started. Things look hopeless to raise that money until she receives notice of her aunt's death, which then takes Elvira to Massachusetts for the reading of the will. A house in need of repairs, a dog, and a cookbook are all that is left to her by her aunt, and again it seems Elvira is having trouble coming up with the money for the Las Vegas show. The adults of the small and narrow minded town make things worse by making things more difficult for Elvira. Only the local hunk (Daniel Greene), and a group of teenagers will befriend her. Elvira's Uncle ""Vinnie"" (W. Morgan Sheppard), presses to make a deal with Elvira for the cookbook, but Elvira soon learns of her powerful heritage that includes spellcasting, and a couple very effective casseroles. Elvira no longer wants to sell the cookbook to her uncle, but he is determined to get his hands on it knowing of its power. Elvira then faces being burned at the stake on the town's old charge of witchcraft, and the showdown between her and her uncle. The plot is pretty simple, but the humor and well developed characters keep it moving at a nice pace. ""Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark"" is full of cute, gross, bawdy, and clever humor carried through by the many sight gags, puns, props, songs, and parodies. The film's touches of the occult make this one of the best horror parodies ever made. It is a well made film with terrific acting by all performers; including Edie McClurg, and Jeff Conaway (of ""Grease."") There are also nice special effects. Many people (including myself) wondered if the Elvira character could carry a feature film, and the answer is delightfully, YES!",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
50,Blazehgehg,"For fans, a great time... for everyone else? It depends.",7,16 April 2016,"I feel like Elvira's sense of humor is kind of a specific one, and may even be an acquired taste. It's very 1980's, with lots of really (and I mean REALLY) corny sexual innuendo.In spite of this, ""Mistress of the Dark"" goes out of its way to portray Elvira herself as more than just a piece of eye candy -- I believe the term the kids today would use is ""sex positive."" Elvira knows what she wants and kicks every guy to the curb that would dare take advantage of her. Even though she plays up the role of a bimbo on occasion, she's often smarter and tougher than that.If you can deal with that, then this ends up being a pretty alright movie to watch around Halloween. Granted, it's a little dull; the production value feels very ""basic cable"" despite this movie's theatrical release. The raunchy humor isn't quite raunchy enough and the pace of the movie feels a bit too slow. It's trying to have bite, but ends up being more of a nibble.The real problem is how the movie beats you over the head with how ""cool"" Elvira is meant to be. She's here to show these prudish small town normies what's up, with her hot rod and her heavy metal and her snarky attitude. It ends up being kind of overbearing at times, with Elvira breaking the fourth wall multiple times just to crack a bad joke directly at the audience. The Bugs Bunny schtick doesn't always work.But I still get some enjoyment out of it.

There's a pair of very big reasons for enjoying ""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark,"" and they are of course, the intelligent script, and the fantastic acting. Yeah, right... Who am I kidding? The lovely Cassandra Peterson bounces across the screen in her incarnation of Elvira, a horror movie hostess who's part Vampira, part Valley Girl, part Mae West, and part Goth chick. True her act is almost a one joke routine, with the audience almost expecting a wardrobe malfunction at any time -- but she does make me laugh big time. The slight plot here has Elvira quitting her movie hosting job, and heading for New England to retrieve an inheritance from her great aunt. The townsfolk there, lead by self-righteous Edie McClurg take an instant dislike to her, and make great effort to drive her out of town. Elvira soon befriends local teenagers, flirts with a brainless hunk, has a confrontation with her evil uncle, and eventually takes on the entire town.There are some pretty big laughs contained in here, and Peterson's delivery is always spot-on and her facial expressions are priceless. Most of the jokes are risqué, usually centered around her highly visible cleavage and her over-active libido. She makes the most of her talents in some very funny ways, like in the fantasy sequence at the beginning where she imagines herself as a winning contestant on a TV game show. She exhibits such excitement here that she can barely contain herself, leaping up and down repeatedly with her arms windmilling. It's quite a sight, and a testament to the strength of duct tape.Edie McClurg supports Peterson nicely, playing ""Chastity Pariah,"" the biggest prude in town, who has some very funny moments. There's even an homage to Carrie, a movie featuring one of McClurg's early film appearances. Jeff Conaway looks absolutely wasted here in his role as a low-life henchman, and considering what became public knowledge about his substance abuse -- he most likely was. A bonus is some cool musical sequences at the end, where Elvira does gymnastics, sings heavy metal, and, actually, raps. Fans of cheesy 1980's music video would really appreciate the poor to bad taste exhibited in these scenes.It's surprisingly funny, and still delivers its obvious message of tolerance.

Unfortunately for her, all she gets is a creepy old house, a poodle, and a magic cookbook.

She is a very successful, beautiful, and funny woman and as Elvira she's all that plus morbid and hilariously naive, not to mention she has an amazing pair of knockers. In this movie, her charms are put to good use.I loved the whole 'fish out of water' feel to the film. You got Elvira, with her low-cut black dress, her big black hair, and her enormous 'twins', and she's in a Christian town where most of the girls aren't even allowed to wear makeup. This also makes her love story with Bob (Daniel Greene) a lot more entertaining.W. Morgan Sheppard is equally great as Elvira's uncle/nemesis Vincent, out to steal the book to use it for evil. He has a lot of presence but still doesn't get in the way and steal scenes from Elvira.What really makes the film is not the plot, but the many jokes. Everything from boob jokes to horror spoofing is here and makes me laugh a lot more than anything from a SCARY MOVIE sequel.

I think it is funny that Brad Pitt auditioned for this movie and got turned down because of his looks! Cassandra Peterson originally wanted Tim Burton to direct but unfortunately he was too busy making Beetlejuice. Otherwise this movie could have been good! If you are in the mood to simply stare at some eye candy and listen to a bunch of old jokes told by a cast of B-listers, this is the movie for you! I actually mean it in a good way.

63,tvsterling,Perfect Movie of it's Type,10,19 September 2004,"I don't doubt that the critics panned this movie, especially the artsy fartsys who need a laxative. This is a great vehicle movie in the tradition of Abbot & Costello or more recently Don Knotts. It won't shake the world or change movies forever. What it will do is entertain. When all is said & done that's the most important thing anyway. Watch this movie & forget your troubles. It even has a simple & kind moral message at no extra charge. I always loved Elvira's TV show when I lived in LA. She did not really steal her schtick from Vampira any more than Vampira did from the original, Theda Bara. This sort of mythic character belongs to whoever does it best; & Cassandra Peterson does it best. Long live Elvira; we need more of these kind of movies. There are never enough. The villain, William Morgan Sheppard, was also excellent. He exudes a wonderful refined malice. I could find no technical faults. The execution is as close to flawless as the art form gets. My profound compliments to the director,James Signorelli,& all his crew.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
64,xdrfrankensteinx,Elvira makesthis movie!,10,8 August 2021,One of the best comedy/ horror spoofs ever! Elvira takes this movie and runs across the finish line.. in high heels! All of the actors pulled it together to make it shine! I have only seen this about 700 times and I have laughed all the way through it!,Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
65,matthewlcorey,Uproarious surreal comedy,7,25 March 2021,"A feature film may seem like an unlikely vehicle for Elvira, the late night horror show hostess. It does not take long, however, for this disarming comedy to win you over. In the same vein as Peewee Herman, Cassandra Peterson's outrageous alter-ego travels to Salem, Massachusetts to collect an inheritance. Her confrontations with the straight-laced residents are uproarious and surreal.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
66,skottyrock,One of the BEST comedies....EVER!,10,8 January 2002,"What can one say about Elvira that hasn't already been said in the world's press?  The classic comedienne that IS Elvira delivers in her first full-length big budget comedy masterpiece.From the very first movie frame thingy, Elvira packs an acting punch that clearly says Film Great....eat your heart out, Bette Davis!  See a forlorn Elvira, see an excitable Elvira, see a jealous Elvira, see a murderous Elvira.  You can do nothing but marvel at her acting prowess!At the heart of this comedy masterpiece is Elvira's desire for Las Vegas show stardom.  Despite putting ""the boob back in the boobtube"" as a horror hostess (with the mostest), Elvira finds the small screen constrictive emotionally....and PHYSICALLY!  Nuff said, she packs up her kitbag and heads East....a hotdog in one hand and a letter from her Aunt's lawyer outlining her inheritance 'windfall' in the other.I've seen this movie so many times, I can almost recite it verbatim....(verbatim would just be showing off)!Grab a copy, laugh yourself silly, learn the lines....Why she didn't win the Best Actress Oscar for this role is beyond me.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark

68,scifighters-57738,Elvira is One of a Kind!,8,28 May 2020,Man growing up and being very into movie collecting one thing I always remember about those pre-teen and teen years... Elvira on late at night with those cheesy B Movies. Me and my friends loved it Elvira was always worth waiting for.Then low and behold she finally has her first movie and a huge group of us went to the movies to see it... What a blast just some good old silly fun as only Elvira can provide.If you're looking for some good fun on a night with a group of friends you can't go wrong with The One and Only Elvira: Mistress of the Dark..,Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
69,MrPunch,Funny in a stupid sort of way,7,7 June 2006,"OK, I saw this in the theaters when it came out and I don't know why. I haven't seen it since, but I ended up on this page because I found myself thinking about this film - again I don't know why. But the fact that I remember it speaks volumes.Comedy is hard - much harder than any drama. Doing it right makes it seem easy, but doing it wrong ... is there anything worse than a bad comedy? Steve Martin, pay attention, you are falling in this category again for some reason.Elvira Mistress Of The Dark must have done it right for me to remember this movie fondly. Done at a quick pace, with tongue in cheek and knowing it isn't the Philedelphia Story, it entertains from start to finish. Brain Donors is another that fits right in this category (sans most of the gratuitous boob jokes).One point of contention - the ending. It seems the writers/director had no idea how to finish a comedy. The ending tries to be a love story, somewhat undermining the quirky fast-paced dialogue up to that point. Then there is the ""tassle"" scene. Whereas this has to be seen (male opinion), it is so over the top and out of place it's like a shock. One more rewrite for the ending was needed.This is not comedy genius like Spinal Tap or The Producers or The Holy Grail. But if you don't try to dissect it and just let the puns and sappy fun come to you, you'll laugh, I guarantee it.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
70,Jayster-5,The BREAST movie of 1988,6,10 May 1999,"This movie contains the two biggest horror icons of the 1980's in all their glory, Elvira! This movie is really not supposed to be ""good"" at all, so I guess it's okay that it's really quite bad. It's very campy... it's also very jiggly! Elvira is a very sexy hostess of B-movies at a cable access channel in Los Angeles hoping to one day hit it big as a showgirl in Las Vegas. When she learns of a relative's passing she hops into her creepy custom convertible and heads for Fallwell, Mass (get it?) and it's a very strict and un-hip town until Elvira shows off her, um, assets to the locals and grabs a lot of attention. She's eventually tried as a witch and gets burned at the stake (almost) all the while striking a provocative pose or making gratuitous boob jokes. Elvira are the only things worth watching in this turkey, but if you wait until the end you will be pleasantly rewarded... ""they"" are very good dancers!",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
71,Fletch06,Elvira is Hilaroius!,8,27 April 2006,"OK, this movie is stupid. I mean that in a good way though.It was stupid on purpose, and was one of the better ""stupid"" movies I've seen. The jokes and gags are purposefully bad, but delivered in a way that it struck all the right notes with me. The supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre. There is a pretty weak plot, but it works just fine.Elvira's character is the focus here.She is lovable and adorable.Cassandra Petersen has a world of acting talent that just glows in this movie.On top of that acting talent she had physical attributes which were frankly, stunning. Few men could disagree with that. The parts that show off her figure were also some of the funnier scenes in the movie.I had a smile ear to ear from the first scene to the last.Highly recommended to fans of comedy, and to fans of beautiful women. I wish they had made a dozen more Elvia movies.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
72,kamillion-111977,I have this movie on an endless loop!,10,5 June 2019,What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said already? It's a classic and very hard to stop watching over and over. I've seen it at least a million times and I never get sick of it for some reason. It just brings back a lot of good memories of my childhood!,Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
73,ocbearclaw,Cult Classic,8,9 February 2019,"Folks, this movie is a 1980s cult classic... Seriously, just push play, sit back, and relax... It's not going to win any Oscars, but if it's a rainy afternoon, or your looking for some quick nostalgia from the best decade, then turn on Elvira. Seriously, the Horror Queen will provide quick laughs and her special brand of sexy!! Go Elvira!",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
74,Ispystuff,Underrated fun,5,19 July 2002,"This movie is pretty predictable, and most of the jokes are pretty stale, still the plot does have it's fun parts. The competition between Patty and Elvira is priceless. I loved the scene where the two stand chest to chest and Patty backs Elvira down, who despite her famous assets, can't measure up to Patty. Elvira gets her revenge later when she reveals Patty wears falsies! I laughed out loud, and made watching this movie worth it for me. An artifice-exposed classic",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
75,dakota_loves_it,wow its funny,9,11 July 2005,"when my sister said this movie was gonna be good i had second thoughts but i watched it and it was actually funny. basically the movie is made of a weird girl who goes to a small town where no one likes her and she just wants to go there and get the reading of her aunts will don so she can go. but its not all that easy. In this movie you will come across hilarious humor, a witch, a book of spells/recopies, a mentally challenged uncle and a dog. You will understand the meaning of the word freak a after anyways i hope you run right out and try to find this really old movie. hope you like it in total i will have to give it a 0.... no I'm totally joking ill give it a 9 hope you understand that you will laugh, you will scream and you may just be offended.love yours truly: Dakota you can email me at dakota_loves_it@hot mail.com if you wanna",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
76,master_of_all,Great fun,8,20 November 2008,"I wasn't expecting much, and, to be honest, I didn't like this film the first time around but watching it again and I realised that it's kinda cool. Sure, it's a one joke film but it's a funny gag. Someone posted that it could be better written and it could be. I think this film had the potential to be a over-the-top My Cousin Vinny. But with a horror host instead of a lawyer. Sadly it's a wasted opportunity. With just a bit more writing it could be a classic. The kids are underused there's no reason why they should latch on to Elvira. Apart from the obvious reasons. It would have been great to see their relationship flourish. I know it's a comedy but it's little differences that separate the good films from the brilliant.Elvira herself is always fun and engaging. Not to mention flirty. Every time she smiles you will too. It's hard to knock a film when the main character is so charming. And it really is her charm, don't let her looks fool you into thinking that she's some sort of tart. Well she is. But she's a nice one. The sort of person you'd let look after your kids. Wouldn't let her cook for them, though...I'd recommend giving it a go. Just don't expect too much.She's more than just a great set of boobs. She's also an incredible pair of legs.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
77,ikennethrios,Jungian Camp,7,5 January 2009,"The magnetism radiated from Elvira, drawing her legions of devoted admirers, has a primordial quality. With her lengthy, well-toned figure, large-bust, innocuously mischievous attitude and grab-bag lexicon of me-generation valley slang, the character of Elvira has a universal and timeless appeal. As an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling, it is evident that the Elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one-liners and large chest. As initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her, she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level: a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic yearning, boyish sexual craving and the desire for non-threateningly lighthearted fun. She symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town. The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients. The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely interesting, her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents. Nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy, only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense. Fortunately, I have such ability and found the film to be a delightful charmer.Best Quote: Bob Redding: How's your head? Elvira: I haven't had any complaints.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
78,Macabre1,"A campy concoction of fun, horror sex appeal, and comedy all poured into a low cut black gown.",10,6 January 1999,"Elvira Mistress of the Dark is just that, a campy concoction of fun, sex appeal, horror and comedy all poured into a low cut black gown and toped with a sky high black bouffant hair-do. This movie is sure to delight any fan of Elvira's. It takes you upclose and personal with Elvira and probes deep into her...um past revealing her enormous... ancestry.The movie takes you on a ride with Elvira as she goes from TV Horror Hostess with the Mostess to her home town of Fallwell Mass to claim her inheritance from a deceased Great Aunt. Where she encounters a stuffy town, a studly cinema owner, a creepy Great Uncle who seems to be after her for more than her good looks. A slew of high school kids that immediately love her, and a town board who are will do anything to get her out of town, even if it means burning her at the stake! Watch Elvira woo the kids, stalk the stud, avoid her creepy Great Uncle and thumb her nose at the stuffy uptight 'preservatives' who have no kind words for her, in Elvira Mistress of the Dark!As Elvira would say ""I guarantee it'll be a scream! (screams in background) Whoa! Good thing I didn't say it'd be a gas!""",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
79,dino0392,"great comedy, horror film!",10,24 July 2001,"elvira mistress of the dark is one of my fav movies, it has every thing you would want in a film, like great one liners, sexy star and a Outrageous story! if you have not seen it, you are missing out on one of the greatest films made. i can't wait till her new movie comes out!",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
80,Cher the Love,"Elvira, Mistress of the Dark (and the movie screen!)",10,28 March 2002,"This film is pure Elvira and shows her at her breast... I mean best! The story (co-written by Cassandra Peterson, Elvira's alter ego) is inspiring and captivating and is brought to life by Elvira's wit and charm. The viewer gets an opportunity to see Elvira in a whole new light as she struggles with the prejudices of the people of Fallwell, Massachusetts (where she has travelled from Los Angeles in order to attend the reading of her Great Aunt Morganna's will) and at the same time tries to help the long-suffering teenagers who have been deprived of fun by the matriarchal Chastity Pariah and the rest of the town council. She also has to deal with her attraction to Bob Redding, the owner of the local cinema, and another woman (Patty) who has her eye on Bob as well but is not nearly as deserving of his love as Elvira. And, later in the movie, she also faces the complications of being descended from ''a major metaphysical celebrity'' and the charges of witchcraft brought against her which mean that she will be burnt at the stake. Elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable, streetwise and naive in this film, while cracking risque jokes and delivering off-beat lines with double meanings.This movie is inspiring because it gives out the message of never giving up on yourself and always trying to follow your dreams. In the end Elvira's dreams finally come true, which is the best thing that could happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman.I've seen this movie countless times and I never ever get tired of it! There are no unnecessary scenes and I found myself captivated throughout the whole movie. A review will not do justice to the actual movie, so I can just tell you to PLEASE watch it because it is one of the best movies ever made! Meanwhile, I wish you ''unpleasant dreams!''",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
81,linoge2004,I fell in love with Elvira!,10,2 December 2005,"I think that this movie is very fun and horror. I love Elvira and I like this movie. It's very pity that second part of this wonderful movie had no success, because it very funny like a first part. I also regret that besides of this movie I have no seen Cassandra Peterson in other films.I think that she is amazing actress with big...potential. I hope that II'll see her in future in the third part of Elvira's adventures. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedy actresses. Cassandra, if you read this, know that you are the best and my heart will be with you. You can rely on me. What can I more add? This is cool and classical movie!",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
82,chriswaynealdridge,Her Best Movie By Far,10,9 December 2018,"I've always liked Elvira's first movie. Great actors, good acting, funny, a good and even serious plot, and not bad special effects for the 80s either. Once again, by far her best movie ever.",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
83,glead4,It's a camp classic,10,1 September 2005,"This has to be one of my favourite flicks, unlike the weak 'Elvira's Haunted Hills'...anyway I love the way the movie is a goth/com 'Wizard of Oz' story...Elvira is a goth Dorothy who is stranded in an unfamiliar town after the death of a Good Witch (elviras Aunt Morgana)...she inherits a ""Ruby"" ring which is extremely powerful and sought after by the Bad Warlock (Her uncle)...She befriends four Characters whom she inadvertently helps grow throughout the movie all the while with a dog in tow. There is a show down with her uncle (the wicked witch of the West) where Elvira realises that she has the strength within her and ends up defeating him. In the end she gets sent off by the towns folk after winning over their hearts and finally gets to her destination Las Vegas (Dorothy's home in Kansas).There are many references made to the wizard of oz throughout the movie...she and her uncle both quote lines relevant to their parallel characters. Elvira: ""Youe must be aunt Em, and you must be uncle Remus....There's no place like home, there's no place like home!"" Bad uncle Vinny: ""I'll get you my pretty, and your little dog too!""There is a sign that Elvira passes when first on her road trip which mentions the state of Kansas.But aside from this, the fact that one of the sequences she ""ripped off, um...I mean was inspired by FlashDance"" is pure genius...and if you don't roll around laughing at her titty twirling at the end of her ""very 80's"" Las Vegas show then you haven't got a camp bone in your body...This movie is a Cult/Camp Classic",Elvira - Mistress of the Dark
