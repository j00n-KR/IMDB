0,TheLittleSongbird,Very enjoyable fish-out-of-water comedy,8,22 May 2010,"The story has a tendency to get on the tenuous side, but this is essentially a very enjoyable fish-out-of-water comedy. It is a one-joke concept but it does that rare thing, the whole film works. It is nicely filmed, the music is good, the direction is skillful, the film does move at a comfortable pace and the script has a lot of nice and funny touches. Beside these things some memorable scenes and the acting made me enjoy Twins even more. I especially loved Arnie's awkward attempt at romancing Kelly Preston, that was a real comedy highlight. Acting wise, both leads are on top form, Danny DeVito is hilarious as the dim-witted scuzzball and Arnie is endearing and handles the comedy well as the intelligent and naive genetically-engineered brother. The two teamed up again in Junior, that film wasn't as good or as entertaining, but I personally enjoyed it even with its problems. Twins for me will be the better film, because while it is one-joke and occasionally tenuous in terms of story(loved the concept I will admit and on the most part it did work very well) it is very enjoyable with great lead performances in particular. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Twins
1,Leofwine_draca,First and best of the Schwarzenegger comedies,6,23 September 2015,"TWINS is the first and best of the three Schwarzenegger comedies (the others were JUNIOR and JINGLE ALL THE WAY), thanks to a freshness of feel and some genuinely funny moments in the script. Schwarzenegger is truly believable as the lunk-headed fish out of water who makes his way to America and discovers that his long-lost twin brother Danny DeVito is a small-time crook with plenty of trouble of his own to contend with.The film has plenty of laugh out loud moments and Schwarzenegger's goofy, idiotic charm fits well with DeVito's sharper, more cynical wit. Yes, there's some sentimentality here in the form of the search for the long-lost mother, but overall this is solid fun, especially when chronicling the twosome's constant outwitting of the various bad guys (including TOTAL RECALL's Marshall Bell) out to get them.",Twins
2,SnoopyStyle,nice and easy but no big laughs,6,14 November 2013,Julius Benedict (Arnold Schwarzenegger) have lived on a tropical island for his whole life. Then he feels he must go in search for his long lost twin Vincent (Danny DeVito) believing he's in trouble. Vincent is a small time criminal who owes money to the Klane brothers. He steals a car to pay off the debt only to discover it is worth a whole lot to other bad guys.Ivan Reitman is doing a fine job. Danny DeVito is doing a good slimebag. Arnold is actually good and funny as the naive Julius. But this one is sold as soon as you see the poster with DeVito leaning on Schwarzenegger. It doesn't really have a sharp edge. It's certainly not that daring. But it's a nice easy comedy. The worst thing to come out of this is a Reitman-Schwarzenegger reunion in 'Kindergarten Cop'.,Twins
3,kosmasp,Obviously,8,19 August 2019,"I don't even know why I never came around to watch this until the other day. Maybe I thought this was quite weird and probably not as good as it turned out to be. Don't get me wrong there are things that did not age well (occasional sexism for example), but are a testament of the time and what people considered funny ... well ""back then"".Arnold and Danny are quite the pair and yes they are unlikely, not just in their physical appearance but also their inner traits and values. The humor is mostly spot on and even though you know where this is going, the feel good vibe (with some added punching and action you couldn't do without) is quite overwhelming and should be able to get to you",Twins
4,gavin6942,Rather Amusing 1980s Comedy,6,26 April 2015,"A physically perfect but innocent man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) goes in search of his long-lost twin brother (Danny DeVito), who is a short small-time crook.Looking back now (2015), it is interesting to think of this as the movie that made Arnold the most money. It has its high points and is pretty amusing, but is really very much a 1980s film. It is not the best Arnold film (perhaps not even top five) and certainly not the best Ivan Reitman picture.There is also the unusual subtext: a ""perfect"" man who comes out Aryan, and the leftovers form a short, swarthy man. Arnold even dyed his hair blonde for the film. By no means do I think Reitman intentionally was trying to make a Nazi reference, but it exists nonetheless.",Twins
5,jboothmillard,Twins,8,22 September 2005,"This was the first of two films that brought director Ivan Reitman (Evolution), Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito together, the second being the pretty silly Junior. Anyway, two non-identical twin babies (second not expected) were born as part of a top secret scientific experiment to create an advanced human being. Many years later after being told he had a brother, good natured, naive and intelligent Julius Benedict (Schwarzenegger) decided to travel to the city where his brother is, to find him. Vincent Benedict (DeVito) is his dim-witted, money hungry and easily-annoyed brother, and after a while Julius convinces him to let him stick by his side. Throughout the film after this they search for the mother, Mary Ann Benedict (Bonnie Bartlett), have get-together moments with their girlfriends, Marnie Mason (Kelly Preston) and Linda Mason (Chloe Webb), and go up against Beetroot McKinley (Trey Wilson) and Webster (Marshall Bell), because Vince stole a car with a priceless piece of machinery in the boot. This film does not have as many laughs as any traditional comedy, but it still works as a great sentimental family film. The song ""Twins"" (at the end) was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Song. Arnold Schwarzenegger was number 54 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!",Twins
6,rmax304823,Amiable Family Comedy,6,21 June 2009,"Schwarzenegger and DeVito are a pair of experimentally generated identical twins, the only difference being that one of them got all the good genetic stuff and was raised by a loving adopted family on an idyllic island, while the other got all the leftover genetic ""crap"" and was raised among thieves and scoundrels. Schwarzenegger's chromosomal map looks like Eden, while DeVito's looks like the serpent.The twins meet some 30 years later and agree to take their girl friends and drive to New Mexico where they will look up their fabulously wealthy mother who runs an institute called Whispering Pines. She's been told that she only had one son who died at birth, so it will be a surprise visit in more ways than one.In addition to the two young ladies, and unknown to them and to Ahnold, they will also be taking along in the trunk a multi-million dollar secret new automobile engine that runs on inspiration alone, and which the reckless DeVito has stolen and plans to ransom. The requisite gang of thugs is in hot pursuit.Schwarzenegger does his best as a comic naif, but it's chiefly because we've seen him in so many grim action vehicle that his innocence and optimism seems charming. Being a scalawag comes naturally to DeVito and he's fine in the role. The two girls are dispensable except that the stunning playmate Arnold picks up along the way is Kelly Preston, who is given to the stylish and sexy hair styles that Queen Noor of Jordan once favored.It's effectively directed by Ivan Reitman and the locations are colorful. Some incidents are more amusing than others, but none flub it entirely and the kids ought to enjoy it as well as mild-mannered adults -- unless the kids start asking those adults, ""How do you make twins?"" There are scenes of sentiment and shallow sorrow that will engage all eight-year-old girls who are watching. The movie will leave all adult men wondering why they can't get their hands on five million dollars and motor their way through the scenic Southwest with Kelly Preston.Best name in the movie: Beetroot McKinley.",Twins
7,paul_haakonsen,Why Schwarzenegger? Why?...,5,9 June 2018,"This never was one of the better Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, but still I decided to revisit it because it might just happen that my memory of the movie was way off.But it turned out that it was exactly as I remembered it.""Twins"" strayed quite far away from the usual action movies that Arnold Schwarzenegger was known for and made famous by during the 80s and 90s.Aside from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito, of course, then the movie also starred Kelly Preston and Chloe Webb, although they didn't have that big roles to play. It was actually quite fun to watch David Caruso in this movie and in that role.""Twins"" does have some funny enough moments here and there, but the bigger picture just was somewhat of a mediocre result.It is definitely not a movie that will be revisited again any time soon.",Twins
8,wes-connors,Laughing All the Way to the Bank,6,17 September 2013,"A top secret experiment by the American government produces a perfect human, arguably, with the birth of bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger (as Julius Benedict). He lives on a peaceful, remote island in the South Pacific. After 35 years, Mr. Schwarzenegger heads out to Hollywood, where he'll find long-lost twin brother Danny DeVito (as Vincent Benedict). A short, fat and balding (fraternal) twin, Mr. DeVito was considered a genetic mishap and disposed of in an orphanage. He grows up to be a petty criminal. After the brothers meet, they set out to find their long-lost mother, who may or may not be dead...The funniest part of this film is the title and concept. If you like Schwarzenegger and/or DeVito, you're likely laughing before the movie begins. Most of the humor is in seeing Schwarzenegger adapt to the outside world. Meanwhile, DeVito keeps the story going by stealing a car worth $5 million. They have a good rapport and work well with director Ivan Reitman. Sex is presented in a pair of tightly-attired sisters, Kelly Preston (as Marnie Mason) and Chloe Webb (as Linda Mason). Genetically absurd, ""Twins"" becomes cartoon-like violent and goes nowhere, but still continues to draw a chuckle now and then.****** Twins (12/8/88) Ivan Reitman ~ Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danny DeVito, Kelly Preston, Chloe Webb",Twins
9,BandSAboutMovies,A fun buddy flick,8,3 June 2019,"Following the success of Ghostbusters, Ivan Reitman produced and directed this buddy comedy that starts with the most simple of what if ideas: what if Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger were twin brothers? That ridiculous premise fuels the entire enterprise.The big winners of this film - beyond the audience - were its two stars. Schwarzenegger and DeVito both agreed o take 20% of the film's box office returns instead of an actual salary. Seeing that this movie made around $216 million at the box office, they did really well - around $35 million each.Supposedly, Schwarzenegger and DeVito were given the option of doing this movie or Suburban Commando. The stars chose this film instead, so Hulk Hogan and Christopher Lloyd did that film. Interviews say that the cast would have switched movies otherwise, but I'd ascribe that to Hogan's carny BS interview skills.But hey - let's get to the movie already. Julius (Schwarzenegger) and Vincent (DeVito) Benedict are the twin result of a genetics experiment to create the perfect child. Julius is all of the good and Vincent pretty much all the bad. Whereas Julius is raised pretty much exactly like Doc Savage, his brother grows up in an orphanage where he seduces nuns and learns how to be a hustler.As they say, hijinks ensue when the two finally meet, including love with sisters played by Kelly Preston and Chloe Webb. There's also a car that has an advanced fuel injection system that's wanted by industrialist Beetroot McKinley and the supremely evil driver and killing machine Mr. Webster (Marshall Bell, the human host for Kuato in Total Recall).Keep your eyes peeled for a young David Caruso, as well as Jeff Beck and Tony Bozzio as band members in a bar scene.Sven-Ole Thorsen - who played Thorgrim in Conan the Barbarian and who shows up in nearly every Arnold movie - is in this as one of the Klane brothers. His resume is all over the place in awesome ways. He's the demon in the Bruce Lee bio Dragon, he's La Fours in Mallrats and along with playing numerous thugs and henchmen, has been in an open relationship with Grace Jones since 1990.Other notables in Twins - well, at least to this site - include Shang Tsung actor Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Elizabeth Kaitan (Robin from Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood and Candy from the Vice Academy series of movies), Criterion Collection co-founder Joe Medjuck, singer Nicolette Larson (who briefly dated Weird Al) and Robert Harper, who is in The Crate part of Creepshow.There's been talk of a sequel called Triplets that would team Schwarzenegger and DeVito with Eddie Murphy as their long lost brother. Here's hoping that happens as this is a fun little film that is continually enjoyable to revisit.",Twins
10,studioAT,Good fun with the twins,5,25 August 2019,"While it has the odd slow moment and some moments that wouldn't pass by today's standards, there is a lot of fun to be had in 'Twin's.Arnold and Danny are on top form as the twins of the title, and there are some really funny moments.I've read that there is a proposed sequel, but after all this time perhaps it is best to instead leave a good film where it is.",Twins

12,hitchcockthelegend,So much fun to be had here.,7,10 March 2008,"As long as you know what to expect, and really that shouldn't be too hard to do when you are getting ready to watch a movie that has Danny DeVito & Arnold Schwarzenegger as twin brothers!Julius (Arnold) & Vincent (Danny) are the result of a genetic experiment that should have realised the perfect child, instead they were born as twins, separated at birth and both went on to lead different lives. Julius was raised on a gorgeous island, he is greatly educated and knows no fear of the world, Vincent on the other hand is a low class womanising weasel from the big city. Upon learning of having a twin brother, Julius sets off to the big city to find the brother he never knew he had, trouble is, is that Julius has no comprehension of city ways, and coupled with the fact that Vincent really isn't the brotherly kind, this only compounds the situation further.Twins is a very tidy piece, the two leads play off of each other very well, and as dumb as the plotting is, it sure as hell makes for a good fun night viewing. Female gravitas comes in the form of the sultry Kelly Preston and the criminally undervalued Chloe Webb, but really the film's charm is all down to the little and large act of DeVito & Schwarzenegger, plenty of laughs here. So open the ale, chomp on the popcorn, and leave the brain at the door. 7/10Yakety Yak, Yakety Yak.",Twins
13,Hey_Sweden,"""I did nothing. The pavement was his enemy.""",8,22 May 2021,"A genuinely endearing and often quite funny gimmick comedy, ""Twins"" still resonates over 30 years later, thanks to ideal odd-couple chemistry between mismatched stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito. They play 35 year old twins, the products of an old experiment in genetics, that eventually become aware of each others' existence. Julius (Schwarzenegger) is a perfect specimen, mentally, emotionally, and physically, and is pure of heart, but he takes it in stride when he sees that Vincent (DeVito) is a rather sleazy, smarmy kind of guy. But Julius is able to convince Vincent to embark on a journey to find their mother (Bonnie Bartlett), even as Vincent gets mixed up in a criminal scheme engineered by a smooth operator (Trey Wilson).""Twins"" is lots of good-natured fun. Even including elements of violence and danger (also involved in this scheme is a goon played by Marshall Bell), it never becomes overly unpleasant, even playing some of its violence for laughs. It's just too amusing the way that Julius, all boyish and naive and sheltered for over three decades, has to be educated on the realities of life in civilization. Arnold has rarely been better than he is here, playing his role with wide-eyed conviction. He even takes the time to do a standard riff on his most famous movie line, and take a playful jab at movie rival Sylvester Stallone (whose ""Rambo III"" was in theatres at the time of filming). DeVito is a natural for characters like the one he essays here, although one can see that he's really not such a bad guy.The two stars are ably supported by a wonderful variety of talent, including the stunning Kelly Preston and the engaging Chloe Webb as sisters who are romanced by our protagonists, and a non-stop assortment of excellent character actors and actresses: David Caruso, Hugh O'Brian, Tony Jay, Nehemiah Persoff, Maury Chaykin, Robert Harper, Rosemary Dunsmore, Richard Portnow, Frances Bay, Marvin J. McIntyre, Elizabeth Kaitan, and Sven-Ole Thorsen. A radiant (and uncredited) Heather Graham plays the mother-to-be in the opening minutes.Directed with verve by Ivan Reitman, ""Twins"" has a lot of heart going for it, and the comedy bits still work very well. This comes well recommended to any fan of the cast and crew; Reitman, Arnold, and DeVito reteamed six years later for ""Junior"".Eight out of 10.",Twins
14,Boba_Fett1138,Having DeVito and Schwarzenegger as twins = instant comedy classic!,7,30 July 2006,"The fact that this movie is already widely regarded as a comedy classic has got very little to do with the quality of it or the story but more with the concept of having the huge and muscled Schwarzenegger as the twin brother of the short, balding and fat Danny DeVito. It's a ridicules and unlikely combination, which at the same time is the very best element of the entire movie.But besides the original refreshing concept is the movie any good? I tend to say no. It is a movie that mostly relies on just its concept and not really that much on the story. The story is quite formulaic and typical '80's comedy stuff. Meaning that it also has a villainous criminal side-plot and love interest(s). Beside the two main characters, the rest of the characters are pretty shallow and uninteresting. Yet the movie manages to be entertaining and fun enough to watch thanks to just its silly concept alone.It's obvious that Schwarzenegger is no talented comedy actor. It's fun to see how he makes fun of his own image but it doesn't feel really natural. But then again, in what other movie does Schwarzenegger show he is a good actor anyway? DeVito is obviously the more talented actor of the two. He times well and he plays his character convincing. The movie also has some other good supporting actors.It's not really a movie with some great and memorable comical moments, with the exception of some fun moments with Schwarzenegger and DeVito. that are a direct result of its unlikely concept. But aside from its concept, the movie isn't really a memorable one.The movie does have a good message in it about family values and accepting each other, without ever going to over-the-top with it, or gets too overdone. It's a well balanced comedy that is always fun, yet unlikely, to watch.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Twins
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Not all bad,6,1 January 2009,"The marriage of Arnie's physical type of film to the wise-cracking, not entirely law-abiding DeVito role is not an entirely happy one. Most of the humor is derived from aforementioned qualities, as well as the naiveté of the former. Like other 80's comedies, such as the Look Who's Talking series, this isn't entirely ""clean"", or OK for children to watch. While the sexuality is toned down to the point where someone who doesn't know what it is won't actually realize it, they're still beyond what a number of parents would consider OK to show their off-spring. The comedy never gets to be childish, in spite of silliness and one or two downright *painful* punchlines. The two stars do well, and when Scwarzenegger gets to let loose the muscle, it tends to be entertaining. Danny is genuinely funny when at his best in this. This movie seems quite happy to provide eye-candy for both genders. The pacing is usually good. This does contain an argument in the nature vs. nurture debate, which earns it esteem(except, perhaps, if one disagrees). I recommend this to any fan of the people involved in making it. 6/10",Twins
16,view_and_review,Perfection is Austrian,6,3 October 2019,"Some scientists at Los Alamos wanted to create the perfect human so they spliced all these genes together from six different men and implanted or impregnated one woman and ended up with a 6' 3"", 230 pound Austrian. Now we all know what perfection looks like.These scientists weren't expecting two children to be born but that's what happened. Julius (Arnold Schwarzenegger) was the picture of perfection while Vincent (Danny De Vito) was the left over unwanted genes. Julius set out to find Vincent when he found out he had a brother. Once he found him they forged a lasting bond.This was an O.K. movie that was slightly funny and slightly moving. Arnold isn't that good at comedy and the innocent, angelic, do-gooder role was a bit annoying. He didn't sell it at all as something genuine. Maybe that was the goal. His act was so see through he looked like a wolf in sheep's clothing. They pretty much had to force the beautiful woman on him he was so perfect. It was somewhat sickening.De Vito was good, as was expected. He played a degenerate which is kinda in his wheelhouse. If there were any laughs to be had then De Vito was delivering them. All the other characters were extras, just there to be human bodies for posterity.",Twins
17,neil-476,Sight gag,7,23 October 2007,"This must be one of the very few films to have been drawn entirely from a single sight gag - in this case, the title ""Twins"" matched with the visual contrast of Schwarzenegger with DeVito. I find it difficult to imagine someone writing this and then thinking ""Now who shall we cast?"" - it seems much more likely that it was a project developed with one or both of these performers in mind.And from a slight beginning, it turned out very well. The sight gag never fails to please, the character similarities and contrasts work very well, the brothers' quest is an adequate plot, the female leads both work well (and Kelly Preston is always sufficient to bring a dead man back to life), and DeVito's character has a nice development arc, as they say: ultimately, the story is about Julius redeeming Vincent.The sentiment feels real and is never overdone.Oh yes, and it's funny, too.",Twins
18,Uriah43,Unidentical Twins,6,3 June 2017,"Created in a lab through DNA experimentation, ""Julius Benedict"" (Arnold Schwarzenegger) lives on the tropical island with the scientist who designed him and develops into a physical and intellectual giant. Then one he discovers that he has a brother named ""Vincent Benedict"" (Danny DeVito) who was born just seconds after him. Naturally, Julius is excited to learn that he has a brother and travels half way across the world to meet him. However, when he finally catches up to him he not only has to bail him out of jail but discovers that they are total opposites in just about everything as well. To make matters even more bizarre, Vincent has a girlfriend named ""Linda Mason"" (Chloe Webb) who just so happens to have a twin sister by the name of ""Marnie Mason"" (Kelly Preston)-and upon meeting Julius she falls head over heels for him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was pleasant little comedy which had some amusing moments here and there courtesy of both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito. Additionally, having a gorgeous actress like Kelly Preston certainly didn't hurt matters either. Be that as it may, while some of the humor got old after awhile this film remained enjoyable for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Twins
19,FlashCallahan,He's starting that funny talk again.....,7,16 February 2013,"Throw plausibility out of the window, and you will enjoy one of the most high concept comedies of the late eighties.The pitch must have been magical ' Schwarzenegger and Devito play twins'. The studio must have seen the dollar signs before their eyes.It's simple enough, they look nothing alike, make Arnold appear to be as soft as anything (something that would have totally been against type for him back then), the obligatory fish out of water jokes, and then throw in a maguffin, to act as a plot.But then these films are not made for narrative structure, they are made to entertain, and it does it by the numbers. They meet, he doesn't believe him, something happens everyday that is alien to Julius, they fall in love, go on a road trip, fall out and then make up with an extra happy ending.The two stars are brilliant in the titular role, and tried to repeat the magic six years later, but failed.For a family movie, its a little violent, it's very very eighties, but you will have fun, that's for sure.",Twins
20,Aaron1375,A good Arnold comedy and his first 100 million dollar film.,7,9 October 2009,"Unfortunately he would go on to make one to many comedy movies and such while he should have been doing action movies. Yes, thanks to this movie the awful ""Junior"" would be made as would the more tolerable ""Jingle all the Way"". To be fair though this movie was rather funny as Arnold and Danny DeVito worked perfectly as complete opposites. The story at times would get a bit far fetched as the whole engine plot was just insane, and it sort of made the movie longer than it needed to be too. Still, for the most part the film works as Arnold is a man who was involved in a project to make a super guy, a near perfect specimen. He later finds out that he had a twin brother and goes off to search for him. They meet and of course DeVito's character does not believe him, but through the course of the movie they get to know each other and all that sentimental stuff. Granted, DeVito's character is a bit rougher around the edges and remained a bit that way even at the end of the film. This movie is a comedy by Arnold and does not contain all that much action in it, but it still has its moments of action as they must evade a super hit-man and some guys trying to claim some money from DeVito's character. All in all rather funny, but part of me wishes it did not do so well, so Arnold never would have made another comedy again.",Twins
21,SimonJack,A less wacko plot could ramp up the comedy of this duo,6,18 October 2021,"In 1988, the premise of this film was quite preposterous - at least to the masses. So, we viewers considered the incredulity of it as part of the humor. And, we just enjoyed the laughs that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito generated in their characters. But, lo, just two decades into the 21st century we learn that scientists are now dabbling in this very thing. One wonders what strange things might come from our trying to ""engineer"" human beings.This film has many complexities. Julius and Vincent learn about their past, scurry around the country and Mexico, and get in and out of one scrape after another. The frantic pace itself overrides the humor at times. The best part of it is just seeing these two together, and how incongruous they appear. It's a wild stretch to think they could possibly be related, let along be twins. Many smiles just thinking of that and them together.""Twins"" has a few very funny lines of dialog. It had great potential, but way too much of the far out background of the twins' births. More just on the two twins getting together, Julius pursuing Vincent, etc. Would have been much funnier.",Twins
22,Mr-Fusion,Mad science breeds good humor,7,25 February 2019,"Here's an oft-mentioned '80s movie that I've only just now gotten around to. And I say that because I feel badly about letting 30 years go by without giving it a shot.Schwarzenegger and DeVito are great choices for these roles. The movie has a great concept to start with, but they play well opposite each other and add to the film's overall likability. DeVito is a natural for this part, but it's surprising to see that Schwarzenegger's gift for comedy was present so early in his career. Maybe that's why I liked this so much; it rests in capable hands. But there's a warmth to this movie that's inescapable. It's a solid comedy.",Twins
23,Smells_Like_Cheese,A fun little and big comedy!,6,17 October 2006,"Now, I was only 3 when this movie was released, so obviously I couldn't see it in the theater, it never really got brought up in my house, I don't even know anyone who has seen this movie. But I watched I love the 80's one time and they brought up this movie and it looked pretty funny. It had some really nice comedic moments with both Arnold and Danny, they were both so naturally funny and clicked so well together, you'd almost believe they were related, they were so in sync.It's about Arnold and Danny being separated at birth, it was meant for only Arnold to be born and just turn into the perfect human being, he pretty much is, he's kind, sensitive, funny, and disciplined. But there was a side effect and all the badness was born into Danny, Arnold learns he has a brother and flies to New York to see him. Arnold is more obvious as the one who wants a family while Danny is just trying to get his way out of debt with the Mafia.Twins is a fun little comedy that I think anyone could enjoy. Although, it's not my favorite comedy with either Danny or Arnold, they still had so much fun that you couldn't resist this film. Especially how Arnold sings ""That good ol' rock -n- roll"", just hilarious! 6/10",Twins

26,OllieSuave-007,Funny mismatched twins.,7,16 December 2015,"This is a somewhat funny Arnold Schwarzenegger movie where he stars as Julius Benedict, who goes out to find his long-lost twin brother Vincent (Danny DeVito). Julius is the intelligent and athletic twin, a product of a scientific experiment, while Vincent turned out to be a forgotten, short low-life, who is on the run from loan sharks.Schwarzenegger and DeVito were funny as the the mismatched brothers, great in chemistry and is sure to send some laughs your way. Schwarzenegger sheds his tough-guy image you used to seeing in his action movies, since he wants to be sensitive to the plight in wanting to reunite with his brother and ultimately find their birth mother. But, you still see his strong, physical self at work as he throws a bunch of bad guys around.DeVito's characters can be excruciatingly annoying at times, but he does have some redeeming qualities in the latter half of the movie. The plot is slow at times, but does pick up steam in the second half. Acting was OK for the most part and you get some nice action-packed scenes. Pretty entertaining.Grade B-",Twins
27,sddavis63,I Like Schwarzenegger's Comedies; Twins Is One Of The Best,7,11 January 2012,"Of course Arnold Schwarzenegger is best known for his roles in action movies and thrillers. Strange, then, that I've always enjoyed him far more when he gets himself into the light comedy genre. ""Twins"" (in which he co-stars with Danny Devito) is certainly one of those light comedies, and as usual Arnold does well with it. It is ""light."" The story is rather silly - which it's intended to be, so that's not a criticism. Schwarzenegger and DeVito play the Benedict twins (Julius and Vincent respectively.) Julius was the result of a scientific experiment to create the perfect human being. The experiment worked well on Julius. He's peaceful, centred, and very spiritual in a way. Nothing much bothers him. He's been raised on a deserted island with the scientists who ran the experiment - told that his mother had died giving birth to him, and not told a very big piece of information. After he was born, his mother had given birth to a second child who had been immediately put in an orphanage in Los Angeles. Fascinated by the thought of having a twin brother, Julius (with no experience of the real world) sets out to find him and to bring his family together.Schwarzenegger was great in the role. He played the part of the naive, innocent Julius discovering the world for the first time perfectly, and he's quite funny at times. Some of the fun in the movie, of course, simply comes from the contrast between the twins - the big muscular Julius, and the short, fat Vincent. These guys are twins? Vincent got the raw end of the experiment. If Julius turned out perfect, Vincent is a guy with a questionable past - a guy owing big money to loan sharks who steals cars. At first, he doesn't quite believe Julius is his brother, but he's willing to take advantage of the situation, so big Julius becomes in effect his bodyguard. (""If you mess with me, you mess with my whole family"" he says to one of the loan shark's collectors after Julius has knocked him senseless, as he defends his beloved brother.) But the relationship grows, especially as the two start to seek out the mother they believe is still alive.Supported by Chloe Webb (as Vincent's girlfriend) and Kelly Preston (as her sister who falls for Julius) this is a pretty funny movie and a fun movie to watch. Adding unnecessary romances to a movie usually doesn't do much for me, but in this case the growing relationship between Julius and Marnie (Preston) highlighted the innocence of Julius, as he has no sense of how to make this relationship work. The movie chooses, unfortunately, to end on a rather silly note. Yeah, it was a silly movie, but (without giving it away) I didn't think the ending added anything to the story. Still, though, it's a good movie, and another of Schwarzenegger's very enjoyable comedic romps. (7/10",Twins
28,Robert_duder,"Insanely fun, sweet, perfect 80's...easy to see why it has a cult status",9,23 August 2013,"If I had seen Twins before it has been years but you'd have to be under a rock to not know what it was. This movie starts out silly and you wonder why everyone likes it and that it starts to pull on your heart strings, you laugh at the silliest things, Arnold's Julius endears himself to you in a way only great movie characters can and same with Vince. The film is one of those movies that lives and breathes the feel of the 80's generation which also leaves you feeling nostalgic and when its all said and done you feel so good and you're smiling and you had a great time. How can anyone not love this movie? It is easy to see why it did so well, why its considered a cult comedy classic and why it launched an unlikely comedic career for Schwarzenegger. Of course the film isn't brilliant...it is what it is. It is meant to be fun and sweet and funny and it nails everything that it tries to be. If you go in expecting some sort of feat of cinematic brilliance then you will be disappointed. Although ironically it is sort of brilliant in the way that it has become so timeless and is so perfectly made for its genre.I love Arnold Schwarzenegger. His action is timeless but his comedy proves how big his personality and on screen charisma is. He is adorable, endearing and very nearly brilliant as the perfect physical specimen who is as naive as they come. He almost immediately makes you love him and its truly a great performance. Danny Devito was the perfect match for him. They are twins like you would not believe...and you won't believe it. Their chemistry together is near perfect and absolutely makes this film what it is. Devito's sleazy, low life Vince wins you over with his endearing quirky personality. Kelly Preston and Chloe Webb are Vince and Julius's love interests. Both are good and serve their purpose but they really don't stand out. They are there to support Devito and Schwarzenegger and they do exactly that. The rest of the cast are basically mobsters and villains to support the story. They are good but again you won't really see any stand out performances. But it doesn't matter because this film lives and breathes the twins and they are absolutely perfect!! Ivan Reitman is a legendary director in many respects. He has helmed many of the great cult comedy classics especially in the eighties. He just as this incredible knack for capturing the feel of the audience of that time period. You watch his films and they are everything that the eighties stood for. Twins has everything..action, comedy, heart...and I will even admit that I just about almost teared up at the end of the film. That is impressive for a comedy to make you feel so attached to characters that are zany and ridiculous. The entire concept of the movie is so outrageous (like a few of Reitman's pictures) but you never doubt it for a single minute. You are caught up in the story and you're having a great time!! This one is going in my permanent watch again and again rotation because it is just fun. If you want a throwback comedy or are in an eighties sort of mood...this one is an absolute must!! Bring on Triplets (chances are it will be atrocious but I need to see Julius and Vince again!!) 9/10",Twins
29,ElMaruecan82,Danny and Arnie... or when comedies had warmth and innocence.,7,20 October 2019,"1953, a super-secret scientific experiment aims to make a perfect man out of six ""contributors"" who include Nobel Prize winners and athletes and a beautiful woman to be inoculated with the seminal milkshake. But as usual when men play sorcerer apprentices, science finds its way to trick them and when the super-baby raises his cute little nose, it's revealed a few seconds later that Mommy carried a clandestine passenger all along.Life found a way in a little boy who's nothing like his big brother is (literally) and there comes another comedy relying on science and the mysteries of life from Ivan Reitman, after ""Ghosbusters"" and before ""Junior"". The title shot says it all, the big blonde baby is Arnold Schwarzenegger and the little one who kicks him in the leg is Danny De Vito, such a cute and tender moment for a blockbuster comedy... because it's a comedy. Boys separated at birth and reuniting for a vengeance has been an excuse for lousy action pictures but who needs action when characters are driven by family love.What ""Twins"" accomplishes is remarkable in its simplicity, it takes the established comedic persona of Danny De Vito and associates it to one no viewer would have anticipated in 1988. Consider that in '87, Arnie had played one of his ultimate action roles in ""Predator"" and it was right after ""Terminator"", ""Commando"" and the ""Conan"" series. Just when he was about to be typecast, Arnie takes a 180° turn and plays a man who's strong and muscular all right but never at the expenses of his good nature, his endless love for his brother and his nerdy attributes. Remember that McBain gag in ""The Simpsons"" where he played a nerd, it's a credit for Arnie to never make his Julius Benedict a similar subject of ridicule, he's genuinely funny because he never means to. For the same reason, even the preposterous premise of having him pregnant in ""Junior"" worked beautifully.But ""Twins"" accomplishes something more, it pairs up the most two different possible actors, body and personality-wise to make it part of the plot, it's one thing to make them brothers, but talk about suspension of disbelief when we're asked to believe they're twins. That's the stuff comedic gold can be made of and in the crucial moment where Julius reveals his identity to Vincent, from each sides of a visiting room, Vincent's reaction is priceless: ""it was like looking in the mirror"", ""we're not identical twins"" retorts Julius and Vincent's face is another credit to De Vito's talent, it says ""oh that explains it all"" with a hint of ""no kidding?"". And apart from a few moments that insist on their telepathic connections (scratching their bottom in the same time, Vincent naming his cat Julius and Julius naming his computer Vincent) the film never overplays it to the point it becomes a cheap gimmick, and in the 80s, it's quite an achievement.I guess that's the third accomplishment of ""Twins"", it has a deep and touching warmth of its own that plays like a wonderful tribute to brotherhood that transcends the differences. Danny and Arnie share the screen literally as they never try to steal one scene from another. And when Julius tries to follow his brothers' steps: how to make up with girls, how to flirt, to dance, to prepare for the big night (because Julius is a virgin) it's funny and goofy but it's played with balance by Arnie who's got a lot of comedic potential, certainly more than his rival Stallone. I criticized Sly for being too ""straight"" even in comedic roles such as ""Demolition Man"", but that same year, Arnie delivered a great self-parodic performance in ""Last Action Hero"" and hints of that truetalent is displayed in ""Twins"". Take that scene when he's teased by the beautiful Kelly Preston, he knows he is but he plays his Julius as an embarrassed man, never embarrassing. Naturally, she stops playing with him and takes full rein.""Twins"" contains two romances, Arnie and Preston while De Vito is with the more jovial and ordinary-looking Chloe Webb and together they have a great chemistry. Heart is something that never deserts the film and contributes to some weirdly effective serious moments, Julius' childish joy meeting the athletic dad, Vincent learning that he was the undeserved one by the doctor prick followed by the heartwarming moment when Julius comforts him by reminding him that it's not just a matter of nature but nurture as well, he lived in a Pacific Island surrounded by love while he grew up in an orphanage thinking his mom abandoned him.It's all natural that one brother would learn the tricks of modern life and the other to be a little less rough when it comes to handle the sweet aspects of life. Isolated they were alone and marginal, together they form a great duo immortalized by that iconic moment where they cockily walk across the street with the same suit, certainly one of the 80's most instantly identifiable moments. Of course, the crime plot is here to give some spice to the narrative but it never indulges to the basic clichés, no chase, no shootouts, and Arnie is only strong when necessary but despises violence. It all comes down to the real climax of the film not being about action or money but a magical reunion between a mother and her lost sons.""Twins"" takes me back to the early 90s when Saturdays evening featured comedies and comedies of that era had such an innocence I truly miss them (though Kelly Preston awakened one of my earliest pre-teen impulses and her presence is one of the things I most cherish about the film).(and for the first time, I post the 100th review of a film)",Twins
30,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The brotherly adventures of The Penguin and Mr. Freeze.,6,30 September 2018,"A film like 'Twins (1988)' lives and dies depending on the chemistry of its two leads, so it's lucky that Schwarzenegger and DeVito play off one another extremely well. Their relationship is a relatable and believable one that constantly drives the narrative and provides several sweetly successful laughs along the way. Arnold actually plays against type slightly, though this kind of 'gentle giant' role is one he revisits every now and again, and his softer approach contrasts well with his on-screen brother's harsher, typically sardonic demeanour. This usually allows the sillier and otherwise less successful sequences to get a pass and it also helps us get on-board with the weirdly over-explained, pretty out-there core conceit. It's not great, but it's entertaining enough. 6/10",Twins
31,bowmanblue,It shouldn't work (but it totally does!),10,1 April 2018,"'Twins' is probably the film that first proved that 'Hollywood action hardmen' COULD do comedy. Before this it was unheard of that someone as well-known for 'action' could ever try and be funny. However, 'Twins' proves that the right actors, meeting with the right script, can produce something that stands the test of time.The premise is simple (if only a little far-fetched) that a *ahem* 'perfect' man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) grows up on a tropical island, to discover that he actually has a long-lost twin brother back in mainland USA (Danny DeVito). Therefore, our - unusually naive - Arnie heads to LA to find him.I first saw this film when I was a kid and loved it then, simply because I was a massive fan of Schwarzenegger and this was the first of his films I was legally allowed to see in the cinema. However, now I'm older (and I can almost quote the film word for word), I can appreciate it on a new level. It really is 'perfectly written.'There's never a moment of the script that feels dragged out, or could be left on the cutting room floor. Every second either moves the plot on, establishes character, or is simply very funny. Arnie proves that he can do more than just beat people up (although he still cracks the odd skull or two here) and plays 'the straight man' brilliantly to DeVito's zany comic character.'Twins' stands up today as it did back then. You don't need to be a huge fan of Arnie's to appreciate this. You only need a sense of humour. It's a comedy that doesn't rely on gross or crude humour and it's not topical, which helps it stay as enjoyable today as it was back then. Maybe it was 'lightning in a bottle' as many other 'action heroes' have tried their hand at comedy since (including Schwarzenegger/DeVito again in the ill-fated 'Junior') and it was never half as good as this.There are few films today that can be described so genuinely as 'fun for all the family.' But, while we still have all these 'blasts from the past,' who cares?",Twins

34,kenjha,"Oh, Brother!",6,7 January 2010,"The products of a genetic experiment, twins who were separated are reunited as adults and hilarity ensues..well not quite. The filmmakers must have thought that having the twins played by polar opposites Schwarzenegger and DeVito would guarantee laughs in itself, as the script is severely lacking in humor. It's meant to be touching as the twins develop a bond, but DeVito's characterization is too cartoony for his transformation from a self-centered jerk to a caring brother to be believable. Arnold is likable as the saintly brother, with the action star showing a nice flair for comedy. It's too bad the writers did not know how to mine the comical premise for laughs.",Twins
35,The-Sarkologist,This movie lacks any clear identity,3,25 December 2013,"This movie is so typical Ivan Reitman. It is a poor comedy tied together with a very poor plot. Okay, not all Reitman movies are this bad, Kindergarten Cop is quite reasonable, and funny, but Twins is not. It is a movie that consists of a poor attempt at humour based around two shallow and clichéd characters.The whole premise of this movie is that Arnold Schwartzenegger and Danny DeVito are supposed to be twins but as they look completely different, nobody believes them. This joke works, well it doesn't work. Instead it is trying to drag humour out of something that was probably funny when we first saw it, but is not funny any more.The two characters, Julius and Vincent, are supposed to be opposites, yet twins. They were both the product of a genetic experiment. Julius was raised on a desert island and is very strong and smart. He is also very naive. Vincent was raised in an orphanage and is short and not that intelligent, yet he is very street smart. Thus the movie comes down to these two solving problems, one with his strength and intelligence, while the other with his wit.This is a reasonable premise, except the movie is dragged down by the characters interacting. This is not a problem except that all of the characters are quite shallow. Marnie is basically a blonde bimbo who is attracted by Julius' strength and doesn't really seem to care about his intelligence. In fact, the whole idea of sex and love is degraded to pure lust in this film.Twins is a dull and boring movie. It does not seem to have any idea of what type of movie it is. It begins as a search for a long lost brother, then into some sort of conspiracy movie, and ending as a road movie. It is not consistent, and the final scene is just so corny. It is very much a ""everybody lives happily ever after"" type scene that makes me sick. Personally I would give this movie a miss.",Twins
36,slightlymad22,Kelly Preston Stands Out,7,11 July 2016,"Continuing my plan to watch every Arnie movie in order, I come to Twins. Plot In A Paragraph: Julius (Arnie) a physically perfect but innocent man goes in search of his long-lost twin brother Vincent (Danny De Vito) a small-time crook.Last time I watched this movie, Arnie's love child had just been revealed to the world, and I felt it lost a lot of its charm due to Arnie not being so innocent. But it's easy to look past now, and again get caught up in the charm of the movie. The movie gets by solely on the charisma of Arnie and Danny De Vito, Of the supporting cast Kelly Preston stands out, she certainly stood out to me back in the 80's. Back then only Kylie Minogue and Christina Applegate (more specifically Kelly Bundy in Married With Children) were hotter to me. She is ridiculously hot here. Chloe Webb is OK, so is Bonnie Bartlett, Trey Wilson is poor and thankfully not involved much, Marshall Bell is weak as ""You've seen my face"" Webster. Arnies old mate Sven-Ole Thorsen again pops up, as does Sly's First Blood costar David Carruso in a small role, and look out for a young Heather Graham as the younger version of the mother. With the exception of the main stars most of the cast didn't do much of note after this. Even the gorgeous Kelly Preston did not capitalise on this movies success, I'm baffled she wasn't offered better projects than what she followed this with. One thing that has always bothered me, Julius made Vincent return the money, but to whom? The money came from Beetroot who was killed. And De Vito says ""Four million dollars"" at the end of the movie, yet earlier the price was $5,000,000 did Vincent lit to jilulius and secretly keep one million. Highlights for me were the first time they meet in the prison, every time Kelly Preston appeared on screen in her 80's attire, the scene with the mother in the office is surprisingly touching!! Something about De Vito's eyes touches me. And of course Kelly Preston (My GOD is she hot) seducing Arnie. Arnie finally had a smash hit, that not only ended the year in the Top 10 of the highest grossing movies of the year. It was also his first movie to gross over $100 million at the domestic box office. Twins ranked 5th with a gross of $111 million. Both were a personal best for Arnie.",Twins

40,johnnyboyz,"They say two heads are better than one; well when those heads belong to Schwarzenegger and De Vito, you know it'll ring true.",6,14 December 2007,"I would say that Twins has aged in the same way other cutesy 1980s films have done; namely Back to the Future with other people taking a liking to films like Labyrinth and The Goonies for one reason or another. I don't think I'd ever actually seen Twins properly until recently and when I did see it, I still felt a certain wave of recognition; a certain emotion when everything was said and done and the closing shot faded out to the credits. Twins is a film that evokes a certain fondness from its viewer but it doesn't do so in a manipulative way; consequently Twins does it in a way that probably won't make you shed tears but won't have you labelling it 'cheesy' or anti-climatic and this is clever film-making proving that it has aged well.I was surprised at how much I could read into Twins. It's true to say that the film allows the narrative to take over once everyone gets going and sorts themselves out since it takes on a road trip approach  from this point on. However, leading up to this point Twins manages to combine humour with deadpan humour; violence with censored violence; family values with self values and manages to integrate Western philosophy and ideals into its aesthetic. The idea is one that although holey, remains interesting and seemingly original: Julius Benedict (Schwarzenegger) has been living on an island away from civilisation; kept adrift from any sort of values be it Western or otherwise which is why his introduction to American life is so clever. Julius discovers he has a twin brother in America and so sets off (in a rowing boat at first) to find him. I find it smart and somewhat political that Julius has been kept away from any sort of 'life' and is a better product of his society than any country in the world could ever teach him to be. America in this film is portrayed as a somewhat lowly and nasty country full of liars; criminals; antagonistic people and apparent mad-scientists who like to experiment with ""human milkshakes"". Julius comes to America strong, well educated, well built and seemingly naïve hence when we see a montage of him in the U.S. for the first time; it's as if a child in an adult's body has been let loose on the streets.Julius' introduction into Western society is just as humorous as it is fascinating to read into. He sees and experiences things he has never come across before; a real fish-out-of-water. The film's montage deals with America's love of food as Julius eats pizza slices and hotdogs, even sharing one time with a tramp which also highlights the homeless problem America may have been experiencing back then. He gets an introduction to clothes, technology, fast food, Western iconography when he compares muscle sizes with Sylvester Stallone: a dominant hard bodied piece of American iconography given the time this film was made: 1988 and during the Cold War when Ronald Reagan was in power. He's also given harsh introductions to violence and sex; these two occurring in the same scene one after each other. After a brief discussion with a guy over some mannequins advertising lingerie; an attempted mugging occurs but unwillingly and somewhat naively; he is up to the task of dealing with it. His second 'introduction' to sex in the Western world comes in the form of looking at a magazine; a few seconds later he bumps into Marnie Mason (Preston) in a one in a million chance encounter: it's no coincidence that this is the girl he will fall for and vice-versa and it's no coincidence that he was looking at a Playboy literally seconds before their meeting.But Schwarzenegger isn't the only star in this film. Danny de Vito plays Vincent Benedict in arguably and unfortunately; his best role behind The Penguin in Batman Returns, four years later. De Vito is quite the opposite in fact he's the binary opposite of Julius: short, cocky, confident and a bit of a criminal; all of which are set up through a series of funny set pieces. But that's the joke: two people who are the exact opposites of one another in terms of physical appearance and yet are twins. Director Ivan Reitman of Ghostbusters fame reminds us that these people are related by having Schwarzenegger and De Vito play out scenes during which they mimic each others activity simultaneously; resembling perhaps a Marx brothers film or otherwise  I wonder how much funnier the takes that didn't work turned out.Twins is a film that knows its place in the pyramid and never dares to be anything bigger or smarter than what it actually is; entertainment. Both brothers' adventures and mishaps leading up to the point it becomes a road picture are played out in an entertaining manner even if I found De Vito's 'wrong place, wrong time' route funnier since it involved incorrect identity and had that criminal element whilst Schwarzenegger's was mostly him attempting to find who his family is which in itself was very heart-warming. Twins is a film that hasn't dated as far as entertainment goes and although it makes couple of clumsy mistakes towards the end regarding getting everyone in one place at one time to do battle with the antagonist, Twins will suffice as a piece of clean yet emotionally effective entertainment.",Twins
41,filipemanuelneto,"A good comedy, still fresh in the collective memory and in some TV channels.",7,17 October 2021,"This film is part of a set of comedies that marked the nineties, and which was starred by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Not all of them worked well, but the fact is that they remain quite fresh in the collective memory and are still present in some TV channels specialized in cinema.In this film, we see the meeting of Jules and Vincent, two non-identical twin brothers who are the result of a highly secret genetic scientific experiment, which aimed, in practice, to refine human genetic characteristics. They didn't know each other and will, together, learn to know each other and discover what's left of their blood family. In the meantime, Vincent will try to get rid of the criminals who are chasing him, and help his brother to find a girlfriend.The film runs on a frightening premise... especially when we think about what has already been done in the name of genetic and racial enhancement. The scientific basis for the experience that the film recounts also seems to me dubious and questionable, as does the way in which Jules lived in isolation, without empirical knowledge of the world until he reached maturity. So the film has a lot of weird and unbelievable things for such a tiny script, but I tried my best to relativize that, give the film a chance. I felt it was fair, as it turned out to be a good bit of entertainment, able to make time go by quickly and have fun. It's not a movie that makes us laugh to tears, but it has its moments.Although the cast has names like Chloe Webb or Bonnie Bartlett, the leading is entirely of the duo Arnold Schwarzenegger & Danny DeVito. Eager to show that he could be more than a beefy action figure, the Austrian giant was huge in the way he clung to his character and made him truly likable, even though I sometimes considered him artificial. DeVito excels in his histrionic, exaggerated, sly and dishonest character. The actor's over-acting fit well with the character's personality. I still think we can particularly mention Kelly Preston's work: she was no more than a sexy girl to be Schwarzenegger's love interest and didn't have much to do, but she pulled off well.Technically, the film is very understated and doesn't stand out. Most of the production values are standard and are within what we would find in an average film from the nineties. This is the case of cinematography, costumes, props, sets... they fulfill their role well, but they don't bring anything really remarkable. The soundtrack deserves a positive note: it's not bright, it has a very eighties-style sound, with synthesizer and electronic touches, but it works and makes itself heard. The editing was done with some care and guarantees a pleasant pace, with the story going smoothly and without delay.",Twins

A Beautifully Feelgood Comedy CLASSIC,10,3 July 2019,"Ivan reitman is a fantastic Director that's a fact!!!Reitman has directed most of my favourite movies of all time growing up such as Ghostbusters 1&2, kindergarten cop,Twins & Junior all those i grew up watching & loving.This was the first team up of Director Ivan reitman & stars Schwarzenegger & Danny Devito who would later all make Junior together & Schwarzenegger & Reitman would make Kindergarten cop.Twins is a lovely light hearted & sweet comedy about finding family & feeling complete.Schwarzenegger & Devito are fantastic together & make a perfect comedy team. There's such a nice feel of fun about this pure 80's classic that just makes me smile.Also Schwarzenegger means alot to me because he was the first ever actor that i knew by name since being little & he was the first ever actor i recognised from movie to movie & the actor that got me into the wonderful world of movies. Big Nostalgia love for the legend that is Schwarzenegger!!! Arnie will always be one of my favourite actors of all time, in my top 5.Twins is comedy gold & the type of fun film that cheers people up, it's a lovely happy comedy filled with warmth & an innocence. Great having the huge iconic action legend playing a twin to tiny funny Devito is hilarious & makes a fun little adventure finding out if they truly are twins.I felt a light-hearted connective tissue through 3 Ivan Reitman films & that's with his Twins, Ghostbusters 2 & Kindergarten Cop. There's a real sweetness & Light-hearted feelgood innocent & music score through all 3 films that feel similar & those 3 movies came out in that order like a ""Trilogy"" somehow by similar themes of goodness & family & vibes & the sweet music.",Twins
47,gcd70,The cast tried hard,5,12 October 2007,"""Twins"" is more than just an unlikely comedy, for the most part, the usually very successful director Ivan Reitman presents a rather silly film which audiences may find hard to swallow.Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny De Vito are the twin result of a genetic experiment. Separated at birth from both his brother and his parents(all seven of them), Arnie decides he will search them out, being that he is in his mid-thirties. Strangely enough this ridiculous movie almost works, and it does manage to deliver some laughs and may even make you smile.

48,Kamurai25,"""Brother to Brother""",6,7 August 2020,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend, if you're okay with a date movie.This movie holds up surprisingly well. It is dated quite a bit, just the dollar amounts they mention are off, and car phones and pay phones. I give full credit to the delivery of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito that keeps this movie enjoyable after all this time.The premise is almost laughable in 1988, but since then we've come so far as it actually being possible that this moves from science fiction to realistic fiction.Yeah DeVito's character is awful on the redeemable side, and Schwarzenegger is comically pure, but it's about using both extremes to find a middle ground in the solutions to our problems. It is also about families reuniting, and strengthening bonds: it's a touching story when you get past the comedy and gunfire.Worth a watch if you can stand a trip in the way back machine to 1988.",Twins
49,PredragReviews,Kelly Preston was beautiful here!,8,5 May 2016,"Twins is one of those late 80s comedy classics with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny De Vito; directed by Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters). Ivan Reitman is masterful at bringing humor into this film without it becoming silly; along with providing an edgy under-toe throughout the film. For all those who complain Arnold can't act, they need to watch this film. While I'm not a huge fan of De Vito, he provides a cynical realism to the film along with some of the more humorous moments.Re-united after several decades of separation, twins Julius (Schwarzenegger) and Vincent (De Vito) Benedict set out to find the woman who was the ""mother"" in the lab experiment that created them...and unbeknownst to Julius, Vincent wants to deliver a stolen engine to a buyer in Texas....an engine that a ruthless hit man is looking to get back by any means necessary. While Schwarzenegger and De Vito were pretty funny (above average for Schwarzenegger and classic De Vito), the hit man was my favorite. He was not your stereotypical bad guy at the time and Marshall Bell brought out the ""geek"" in him. Sadly it's something many media have now tried to create a stereotype of... all attempts have failed.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Twins
50,Sandcooler,"Standard odd couple story, saved by the acting",6,17 May 2011,"Pretty much every Arnold Schwarzenegger comedy is kind of a guilty pleasure for me (even ""Junior"" had its moments), this one is no different. Teaming him up with Danny DeVito was a good fetch, they seem to have a curious chemistry with one another that works really well on screen. Not a lot in done with said chemistry though, given that there aren't really any memorable scenes in this movie at all. It's light and fluffy, but never really that hilarious and often lethally formulaic and predictable. Director Ivan ""Ghostbusters"" Reitman tries his best to keep the pace high, but inevitably the movie does start to drag a little because the plot is so unsubstantial. I didn't hate ""Twins"" though, and I could never be mad at it. It just isn't a good movie, apart from that it's flawless.",Twins
51,michaeltrivedi,Actually Really Good,7,13 September 2020,"The dynamic between Devito and Arnold is incredible. The situations they get into are laugh-out-loud funny and sentimental at the same time. From dating to everything else, they are having fun together.Worth watching definitely7 stars",Twins
52,IonicBreezeMachine,Arnold's first foray into comedy is an above average precedent setting comedy,6,4 July 2021,"After 35 years of living on an isolated island where he's refined his mental, spiritual, and physical strengths, Julius Benedict (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is told of his twin brother whom he'd been separated from at birth. Julius decides to leave his home and sets off to find his long lost brother, Vincent (Danny Devito). Vincent carries on as a low rent hustler with and is in large amounts of debt to to various schemes backfiring. When Julius meets Vincent, Vincent doesn't buy his story that their twins but lets him stay around out of convenience. When Vincent steals a car meant for an illegal deal worth $5 million dollars he jumps at the opportunity but is sidetracked by Julius' search for the two's long lost mother, tagalongs from Vincent's girlfriend Linda and her sister Marnie (Chloe Webb and Kelly Preston), and various sinister characters who want Vincent dead including the car's original owner.Released in 1988 Twins came about from a meeting between Ivan Reitman and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Schwarzenegger was impressed with Reitman's work in projects like Stripes and especially Ghostbusters and wanting to branch out from his usual wheelhouse wanted to try his hand at comedy. The studio was hesitant to make a comedy featuring Schwarzenegger who although proven reliable in action films was untested in comedy. Schwarzenegger, Devito, and Reitman all took pay cuts in favor of payment based on box office gross and Twins became a sleeper hit making well over $200 million world wide against its thrifty $18 million budget and created a framework for action stars to appear in lighter comedies that is still seen to this day (for better or worse). Twins is a pleasant outing that mines the silly premise of Danny Devito and Arnold Schwarzenegger as twins for all it's worth with some good comic setpieces and genuine likability.The movie's strong point is in the difference of deliveries with Schwarzenegger's larger than life physical presence complemented by his relaxed near deadpan delivery that is well situated with Devito's short stature and more energized approach that gives the two a pitch perfect odd couple pairing that ignites whenever they're together on screen. The two are playing completely different characters with unique traits, mannerisms, and motivations and there's some very well setup and paid off comedic friction between the book smart Julius and the street smart Vincent. The movie also has some nice scenes between Julius and Kelly Preston's Marnie with Preston displaying warmth and charisma and rather endearing scenes between herself and Schwarzenegger. If I were to nitpick the movie, I'd say the film sometimes works against it's strengths by having Schwarzenegger and Devito separated on a few too many occasions (particularly the beginning and the end) while both Schwarzenegger and Devito do score some good laughs on their own (especially a funny scene involving a Rambo III poster) the comedy is strongest when they're allowed to play off each other's larger than life personalities. There's also a rather badly dated joke involving Vincent having lost his virginity to a nun at 12 years old that's pretty cringe inducing, but thankfully it's only referenced twice .Twins isn't a great comedy, but it is a good comedy. With likable leads conveying a high concept premise with believability and gravity it helps to naturally mine humor from the situation in a way that feels natural. While I can't say this is one of those ""must see"" comedies like the ones ingrained in cultural consciousness, it's a pleasant diverting distraction that show Schwarzenegger can be funny.",Twins
53,Stampsfightclub,The fantastic partnership makes this movie what it is,8,4 September 2006,"The plot of this film speaks for itself. The idea is simply terrific and works extremely well. A smart handsome athletic man is the twin of a short dumb criminal, comedy conventions all over and will guarantee to leave you chuckle all the way through.The story is very simplistic and easy to understand. As well as being categorised in the comedy genre there are many emotional ideologies contained within the hit film. There are many family issues raised by the characters and love is a central theme in this relaxed plot.The whole film is about the brothers and how they get along. De Vito plays the sluggish criminal Vincent who finds it difficult to accept his brother and Arnie plays the very enthusiastic brother Julius who is always willing to do everything he can. Having two different types of characters allows the tension and excitement of the film to boil up and engages the audience into watching the humour but also the emotional ideas contained. It is very heart warming and will bring a smile to your face as some actions are completely ridiculous in a humorous sense but the ending is also very special for many people. There are many 'brother' conventions. De Vito is willing to help his brother into the world and teach him the things he knows as is Arnie.Through the use of this partnership the plot is very consistently funny with more speaking humour than physical but some dancing scenes involving the pair towards the end are very humorously memorable.The idea of juxtaposing two completely figures in Schwarzenegger and De Vito was sheer movie genius. It conveys great humour throughout and through this bizarre partnership audiences will be able to appreciate the comical ideologies put forth but the director of 'Kindergarten Cop' and 'Junior'.De Vito completely outshines the terminator who we all know can't act but some of his scenes with Kelly Preston are very funny.Though the partnership was great it was a shame De Vito and Schwarzenegger got together again for 'Junior' which was terribly unfunny and predictable throughout and this 1988 hit completely outshines it in every aspect.The use of each character's personalities makes this film what it is and is therefore a much watch for anyone who enjoys family jokes.A very relaxed comedy with chuckle-some jokes worth watching for the whole family 8.5/10",Twins

Twins is a hidden gem. Kelly Preston is exceptional. Beyond gorgeous. She wears awesome, sexy outfits in this movie and she's bad, very ultra bad. I miss her being in movies. The 80s should be renamed The Kelly Preston Time Era. She's so, so hot, her beauty is unmatched nobody looks like Kelly Preston. She's so sweet.

55,bellino-angelo2014,One of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best comedies,8,7 February 2021,"I am not a huge fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger tho I liked him in most of his movies (especially the action ones). There is always a period during summer that on channel 6 they always air on Sunday the two comedies Schwarzenegger did with Danny de Vito, JUNIOR and this one. I didn't hated JUNIOR that much but I did find this a lot better.Julius and Vincent Benedict (Schwarzenegger and De Vito) are two twins that were the result of an experiment of producing the perfect man! In fact they don't look alike a lot: Julius is tall, strong and good natured; Vincent instead is short, womanizer and a crook. When they meet they'll have to learn a lot from each other and of course they will help discover their differences and will even find their soulmates (Chloe Webb and the late Kelly Preston).This movie in substance is fun: Schwarzenegger and De Vito have a lot of chemistry together and their pairing make for a lot of funny vignettes (like when Schwarzenegger learns how to drive and when they are in the nightclub with their women). The supporting cast is good, especially Kelly Preston other than being gorgeous gives a credible performance. There are also veterans Hugh O'Brian and Nehemiah Persoff (who is still alive at 101!). The soundtrack has even some great songs of those years (my favourite is BROTHER TO BROTHER).However, don't have high expectations for this movie. Just think of it as a funny comedy of which the laughs will come natural as it has many funny moments.",Twins

Remember in the 80's how being a womanizer was cool, like manipulating people and then throwing them away was a socially acceptable trait. Man, 1988 must have been one hell of a year, or, in retrospect maybe not. Kelly Preston's hair looks like it hurts her, is her stringy over-teased hair like mad at her? Hair is supposed to be friendly. Yes, Twins is a vehicle to market Arnold Schwarzenegger as able-to-appear-in-comedies, and it paid out- Jingle All The Way, Kindergarten Cop, Junior.

60,DavidSim240183,One of Arnie's better comedies.,8,27 June 2004,"The idea of Arnold Schwarzenegger being in a comedy sounds like a recipe for disaster. But his stiff delivery actually works in his favour for this film, and he makes a great double-act with Danny DeVito.Arnie plays Julius Benedict, and is the result of a top secret government experiment to create the world's most physically and mentally enhanced human being. Six men who were model citizens, like athletes and scientists were chosen to contribute a sample of genetic material. Mary-Ann Benedict was chosen to carry the baby. But instead of giving birth to one baby, she had twins.Julius was taken to a tropical island in the South Pacific where he was educated and cared for. By the time he was 35, he can speak up to twelve languages, holds degrees in biology, chemistry and physics, and is an expert in the martial arts. When he is told he has a twin brother, Vincent, he decides to leave the seclusion of the island to find him.Vincent (Danny DeVito) had a completely different upbringing than Julius. He was taken to an orphanage in Los Angeles, where he eventually ran away. By the time he was 35, he is up to his eyes in debt, loan sharks are after him, and he is now in jail.When they finally meet, they are both shocked that they look nothing alike, and are almost completely different in every way. Julius is very naive, and has a big heart. Vincent is a selfish hustler, who has as much taste for women as he does for money. Despite their differences, they try to track down their mother, and learn more about each other in the process.Arnie and DeVito have a terrific chemistry, and director Ivan Reitman made the wise choice of putting the two of them together. Its clear in their scenes together that they enjoyed working with each other. Scenes such as Julius saving Vince from a loan shark, and Vince teaching Julius how to dance are definite highlights.Reitman adds more into the film with a subplot about a stolen engine Vince wants to sell. Honestly this doesn't contribute anything to the film, and the most interesting things are Julius and Vince's exploits.Arnie manages to be convincingly awkward as he deals with the outside world for the first time. DeVito is perfectly cast too, and he shows what a great actor he is by being dramatic as well as sarcastic. Interestingly, when Reitman paired them up again in Junior, the magic wasn't the same.Although not on the same level with Reitman's Ghostbusters or Evolution, Twins is very entertaining, and is carried almost single-handed by Arnie and DeVito.",Twins
61,SkullScreamerReturns,"If you want a feel good movie, watch this",7,1 June 2020,"I was under the impression that Schwarzenegger's entries in the comedy genre were not that good, but I watched Twins again since a looong time, and found it a lot better than I remembered. Maybe it was my teenage opinion that it was boring because there was not action...? But Arnold manages to be very funny, and his dynamic with Danny DeVito is hilarious. Their totally different physical appearance alone makes it look funny, and they also have quite good interaction. There's also a heartfelt friendship thing that develops, so it's not just mindless slapstick but also has an aspect of a warm drama.Ivan Reitman directs, and since the original Ghostbusters is one of my all time favorite films, it's easy to see why I like the Twins too. There's just something in that Reitman style.It's a comedy. If you want a comedy and nothing else, it's good!",Twins
62,willcundallreview,A fun but only only just OK-ish film,6,5 April 2014,"Rating-6/10Twins is a fun film that although maybe isn't film at it's best, still manages to entertain and maybe even feel a certain something for the characters. With an acting performance we have rarely seen before and a plot that we would never expect, the film serves to be fun and it's exactly what it does, well kind of. I felt it was a safely kind of OK film but nowhere near being good, here is why I felt that way about it all.The story is absurd but fun and although I did feel it was a bit crazy it served to be entertaining for just over an Hour and a half. It isn't that funny is fair to say and the comedy part lacks, but hey even when it is trying to be humorous, it is still fun anyways. Finally on the plot, we already gathered it is crazy, but it has heart felt moments where you actually do feel for them slightly, the ending can take that away a bit but still show's us there brotherly love.Arnold Schwarzenegger actually does this role without killing people, he does it with his massive frame, big fists and short shorts? ,yes it sounds like he has gone mad but he actually does OK here and is one of the only emotional performances Arnie has ever done. Danny DeVito is fun as his twin and is also down on his luck a lot, he plays these parts the best in my opinion and obviously the way that one twin is massive, one twin is small makes for some fun and great circumstances.Ivan Reitman at the directing helm does a good job and for such a difficult comedy to do with such absurd circumstances, he does a fine job indeed. I felt the script is the weakest part of this movie with some horrible lines that just serve to annoy the viewer rather than make them laugh, whether or not the lines are delivered right by the actors is up to you but for me it is the screenplays fault. I actually enjoyed the cinematography which although is typically 80's in it's shots, works really well and most street scenes and car scenes are done beautifully well.As I said before, the film isn't so funny and if you want big laughs then this isn't for you, it tries it's hardest at times as well but misses the overall mark of the film. I also did feel that although I said the acting was OK and Arnie's best, it still isn't that great, and even for a comedy which can sometimes escape with bad acting, the acting here is kind of emotionless and stale, AT TIMES. One more thing is the crazy idea all together which doesn't work THAT well but ah well, just have fun with it.People who enjoy good and fun movies with a little heartfelt emotion intertwined within should like this as well as those who like a movie where the actors just look like they had fun making it. Arnie fans may be left disappointed if they are expecting violence and armed gangs, he does used violence about once or twice in this but he is no Commando by any means in this film.Overall I'll give it a 6/10 because I did feel it was safely an OK- ish movie, albeit it is nowhere near being good let alone just OK but it still is entertainment and these two actors together on screen at there best and funniest. I would also say to watch it as rumours of a sequel are flying around now and again so just sit back back and enjoy the ride, even if it is a little bumpy.",Twins

64,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,7,23 March 2005,"Arnie shows his range wonderfully here in this light-hearted, but clever and touching comedy, using all the comic and action ability he has previously shown. Getting a younger, and more widespread audience here would ensure that more people would come to love Srnie, and he would be the greatest movie star ever.Arnie plays Julian, a twin separated at birth from his brother and mother in a dubious experiment. Once he reaches a certain age he decides to go in search of his lost brother and mother, but he is not an ordinary guy. He is a genius, a muscular giant with great fighting ability, and is naive and innocent when it comes to women, the outside world, and crime as he was brought up in a tropical paradise. His search takes him to America and to a big city. Eventually he finds his brother Vincent, who was the 'failed' half of the experiment. He is small, weak, and a small time crook and womaniser, but street-smart. Vincent is going to be killed by loan sharks unless he can come up with some money fast, but when Julian interrupts, beating up the bad guys, Vincent thinks he can use Julian as protection, even though he does not believe they are brothers. However, they search for their mother anyway, as Vincent is making one last deal to save himself. They grow to like each other, and Arnie falls for Marnie, the sister of Vincent's girl. The mob are on their backs, and Julian will not stop till he finds his mum.The film works because the chemistry between Devito and Arnie is perfect. The script is also very sharp, with plenty of jokes, room for action, and with a charming quality too. The cast is good, and all seem to have a great time making it. Arnie's one-liners are present-'The pavement was your enemy' and 'You forgot the third rule in a crisis situation', but the rest of the humour is good too. The way the twins are so different, yet act the same, doing the same things at the same time etc. Arnie's singing on the plane is great too. Overall, a good Arnie film, but one for the family to enjoy, rather than just the action fans.7.5 out of 10",Twins
65,tastyhotdogs,Most ridiculous movie ever?,6,14 January 2006,"What a ridiculous premise for a movie.Julius (Schwarzeneger) lives in Austria. One day he discovers he has a twin brother who lives in America. Julius decides to go there to try to find and meet his long lost brother, from whom he was separated at birth. Turns out his brother Vincent (DeVito) is comically much smaller than him, plus very different. Initially Vincent isn't interested in his long lost brother, but when he realizes he may be able to use him to help him get out of trouble, he lets him hang around. This brings us some of the lighter moments of the movie as the big goofy Austrian tries to learn American culture. Eventually the two grow closer and start to work together. Will they find their mum? Will Vincent's troubles with some bad guys bring about his death? It's funny how in the 80's you could get away with putting a movie out like this, let alone it becoming a smash. These days producers are less shameless in how they try to see how desperate and predictable the movie going public are, generally by bringing out totally unwarranted sequels (see ""Legally Blonde"", ""Miss Congeniality"" and the in-the-works ""Oceans 13""). Another popular one is putting tough guys in kids movies. I'm getting pretty disillusioned with movie going these days. It started with the candy bar prices, then the ticket prices, now it's the actual movies. I think I've gone to see less than 10 in the last year, and this is from someone who loves rushing to see a long awaited movie. Nowadays I go to Star Video and hire stuff from the last 20 years I didn't get around to seeing. I put most of the blame on ""Meet The Parents 2""",Twins
66,deepfrieddodo,Simple & Successful Partnership,8,17 November 2021,"Schwarzenegger's first attempt at comedy, and such a success that he would continue to star alongside DeVito in the future. That success was down to this partnership, as complete the opposites fill in all the areas a great film needs.It's not hilarious, there aren't big laughs at any point, but the whole vibe of the film is easy going and fun to witness. The plot is ridiculous and casting was of course perfect. Schwarzenegger shows his range as he plays the innocent, perfect person, still naïve to the outside world. DeVito in contrast continues a role he has perfected across many films.The plot is simple and doesn't divert from the novel concept, Schwarzenegger spends plenty of time showing off his physique, and DeVito brings everything together with his relatable reactions.

He sets foot off the tropical island he was held on where he grew knowledge and learned to defend himself from violence to find his brother who turns out to be the exact opposite of him. Though not leaving him, the brother steals a car and finds out it holds a machine that is worth for five million dollars. But when he tries to cash it in he must face the truth about his past, defeat evil loan sharks, and not be killed my the mysterious villain Webster. First of all this is a really good film. Arnold is perfect as Julius and Danny does a good job as Vincent. The brothers love interests are nice except for Danny's girlfriend, she was a little annoying. The villains are menacing to from the evil Webster to the dealer Mr. Beetroot. The plot is rough though. First the viewers are thrown into the plot of Julius looking for Vince and then they tie in the plot with the loan sharks and then they set out for five million dollars and then they look for their mother and it's back to the five million...the whole plot is clunky! The relationships are heart warming and will make you care. This is a good family film and you'll enjoy it. And believe me, it's ten times better then Junior!

I think this holds to be very true in families, even with the separated by birth dilemma. Arnold is directed well and plays the gentle giant with an intellect well because he is very smart. Note how Arnold never took the brash, arrogant, bad guy character which all muscle guys were typically cast as and stuck in this genre.

72,IridescentTranquility,"Great dialogue and a thoughtful, moving story",8,24 February 2006,"The beginning of Twins has a surreal tone to it it. This caring voice-over contrasts so much with the sinister look of the lab, and the music gives a much sadder feel to what is already present. I think the idea of putting two physically opposite actors together and deciding to make them twins works in this film, especially considering that the plot tells us they have genetically modified origins. Julius' odd upbringing - isolated on an island - and its after-effects are obvious very early on. He asks for a manual when asked to drive a car somewhere. You get a sense that everything is so novel to Julius - even eating an ice cream (a shot which is beautifully lit). As you wouldn't, he hasn't the first clue about romance. Vincent, of course, is totally opposite, and you know this in just a few scenes. The brothers' scenes are often juxtaposed to show this. I especially like Vincent's expression in the ""third rule in a crisis"" scene.The bionic hand when Julius' briefcase is nearly stolen is inspired - he pulls up his would-be muggers on such things as wearing motorcycle helmets. The fire extinguisher scene is so wonderful in showing how shady Vincent is and how good Julius is - Julius doesn't even hate Vincent when he rejects him. In fact, even their names seem to suit the characters. The relationship between the brothers is interesting. Vincent suddenly shows a united front with Julius, strangely enough when Julius deals with someone who is hounding his brother. Although they are twins, Julius acts like a much older brother as they learn more about their past.Some of the dialogue in Twins is brilliant. ""Oh, I like nuked food!"" is such a great line from Julius, and Vincent's ""I liberated this from my file at the orphanage"" says so much about his personality in just a few words. There's also a wonderful scene after the fight in the nightclub where the line-dancers carry on dancing around the unconscious henchmen.",Twins
73,kidwltm,"Nice Concept, Poor Execution",4,8 July 2003,"The entire (not so bad) plot of the film was just a way to set up a screen union between Schwarzenegger and De Vito, and so relies heavily of the two to carry the film on their shoulders.

But because they had these two big stars, the writers just set up scene after scene of silly predicaments to showcase their differences in appearance and personality. It works in the beginning, but gets old fast.  The scenes with the two sisters/girlfriends are nice enough, but once again, just get reused way too often. And the whole subplot with the fuel injector and criminals is just silly.  It's still a good movie to watch if your a big fan of either of the two main stars, but I wish this movie had been kinder to them and Reitman.

74,zelda1964,Two Of a Kind,7,27 July 2010,"Both Devito and Schwarzenegger are really good actors.Here is a film that makes someone ponder about Nurture and Love.Devito plays Vincent,a sly,""son of a gun"" who thinks he can get away with everything.When he gets into trouble, Vincent finds a pair of helping hands that belong to someone he can trust.Julius(Schwartzenneger)his brother,is a person we find who became part of an experimental study at birth.They need each other, and help one another find their lost mother.Kelly Preston, plays Marnie, the girl Julius always dreamed about.It is saddening,when you see how intense and eager Vincent looks at his mom.His eyes are like a puppy searching for recognition and loving arms to hold.In finding out their mom still lived,their hopes were restored.This movie made me realize the power of Family.",Twins
75,spencergauldin,The Benedict Bros,6,26 July 2020,"It took a long time to finally watch this movie but I did it. It is a good comedy with some good chuckles and message of family. Arnold and Danny had a good duo going with their characters based on the different backgrounds that they came from. Arnold knew so much but had experienced so little since he was on an island his whole life. Danny didn't know much of general knowledge but experienced much more than Arnold. Their twin duality was good and made decent entertainment. The dialogue had some good quotes. They literally had Arnold say ""I'll be back."" like in the Terminator which was kind of lazy to do. Ah heck it was the 80s and they had Arnold.
The best getaway from the movie is the message of family and how Arnold and Danny look and act so differently, they are brothers. The genetic doctor that they meet that planned to make the best genetically modified man literally told Danny that he took all the crap and Arnold got all the good stuff when they were born genetics-wise. Seeing them as a family again with their real mom and their new families with Linda and Marina.
Biggest downside was the conflict wasn't that high and the antagonists were so incompetent.
It's an entertaining film and probably one of Arnold's best comedies.",Twins
76,quatermassandersen,Absolutely gorgeous film,8,25 March 2000,"Twins is one of the finest films ever made.It stars a particulary fine Schwarzenegger in his first comedy outing and he was outstanding in every scene, DeVito shines all the way through and he has many funny lines. Together they had the  charisma and talent to make for many memorable and superb scenes, it was all outstanding in this film . An extremely beautiful Kelly Preston also starred and gave extra spice to the film.The story is cute and charming, the music soundtrack was very good and Georges Delerue and Randy Edelman gives us the best tunes ever made.As comedies go Twins is my favourite because it combines a perfect cast with a charming story and great music. Great directing job by Ivan Reitman.",Twins
77,UnknownRealmsDotNet,"Double the trouble, double the fun!",5,27 August 2012,"This is not a good movie. That doesn't, however, make it bad. Because it's got a lot of fun -- bad acting, cheesy 80's music, a lame plot, and Arnie!! The idea of two genetically engineered twins being nothing alike is a fun concept. It's a great setup for a comedy (especially with two opposites like Arnie and DeVito). It's also a great setup for a drama. Unfortunately, the concept isn't explored too deeply and this follows a pretty standard, by-the-numbers story structure. Hey, this is an 80's comedy after all. But did I mention it has Arnie?. This is simple, feel-good, nothing-deep, sit-back-and-relax entertainment. Nothing wrong with that.",Twins

79,blw37,Above average fish out of water/odd couple type comedy,7,10 April 2003,"This is a quietly amusing film which I enjoyed more than I expected.While Schwarzenegger is the ""star"" of the movie, this is really de Vito's film.  He dominates every scene he is in, and maintains a manic character who actually shows some change as the film progresses without losing the basic energy of his persona.While the plot is a little tenuous at times and there are only one or two real belly laughs I enjoyed the film, even on the small screen.  Worth watching, but probably not worth buying.",Twins
80,Avoura,Beautiful film,10,16 January 2005,"This was a great film. The story is of a man (Julius Benedict, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) who grows up on a tropical island with a scientist, and knows nothing of modern society. Then one day he finds out he has a twin brother in L.A. He was also told that his mother died giving birth to him and his brother. When he gets to L.A. he finds his brother, who appears to be nothing like him, sort of an opposite person entirely, although they share some things in common. Julius is very pleasant, sensible, intelligent, Vincent, his brother, is a petty car thief and always getting into trouble. Julius goes looking for where their mother lived and finds she is gone. He finds one of his 6 fathers, but not his mother. He is given an address in New Mexico to find a scientist who was at his birth. (Julius was part of a secret govt experiment to produce a superhuman man). He goes with his brother Vincent to find the scientist, who tells them their mother is alive and well and living near Santa Fe. So they go off looking for her, find her but don't realise it, as she thinks they are tricking her. She was lied to as well, being told that her son was dead, and nothing about the twin son who was born 1 minute later.Add to that some villains chasing the brothers as Vincent is driving a stolen car with a secret jet engine stored in the back, and some comedy along the way, and some magnificent scenery along the way.I thought the relationship between the two twins was great, very well done, and believable. What they said about being a family was very moving. And at the end it all works out well.An excellent film about relationships, family, and what is important in life, and about how to do the right thing, when at the end the twins do the right thing and get rewarded.I recommend this film. If you view it as a violent movie about beating the criminals, it can work on that level, if you view it as a comedy it is quite good too, but as a film about family and relationships is where it really works best, view this with an open heart.",Twins
81,raimi3,"""Tonight is your night Bro!""",6,10 March 2009,"I'm a fan of Ivan Reitman comedies, and Twins is no different. Arnold and Devito make a great on screen pair, and the movie makes good use of the obvious physical differences comedically I think.I always remember Twins as the first movie that displayed the softer side of Arnold. To the date, his movies were mostly action flicks of the sci-fi, fantasy, and crime ilk. Twins would be the first of three Reitman comedies that Arnold would star in showing a kinder, gentler, and funnier side that I think worked well. Devito was a great support beam for this new experiment, and the two created some memorable moments together.The premise isn't as far fetched as it might seem on the surface. Arnold is artificially created in a lab using the DNA of several men who excel in different fields. This DNA is used to artificially inseminate a volunteer woman. The idea is to create a perfect man and it works splendidly for Julius (Arnold). Unfortuanely, the unexpected twin brother, Vincent (Devito), is born soon after with none of the genes of his multiple fathers, as they were all used up on Arnold.The two are separated at birth from each other and their mother, who was told that they both died during labor. Arnold stays with the experiment on a remote island and lives a wonderful life while Devito is sent to an orphanage on the mainland as basically the left over garbage, neither of them knowing the other exists. In adulthood, Arnold is told of his twin brother and he seeks to find him, and their mother, and become a real family.If you enjoyed the other Reitman/Arnold films, Kindergarten Cop & Junior, than you will surely enjoy this one too. The comedy is light hearted with a touch of sentiment and makes for a good family film.",Twins
82,gfrost7617,should rate higher,7,12 September 2020,"Obviously Arnold and Danny aren't Oscar winners but the movie should still rate higher and people should not be so snobby about movies. C'mon, what a funny premise that Arnold and Danny could be twins. Who doesn't like a road trip? Who doesn't like finding out about a long lost loved one like a brother or a mother? Easy to watch and some funny happenings along the way and a cute ending. Just enjoy.",Twins

86,idleprimate,your face hurts from laughter,8,19 April 2010,"usually, in this kind of ""duck out of water"" comedy, you would see a comedian. well, i guess you do, with Danny DeVito, who is always great. But I submit, that Arnold Schwarzenegger has been miscast in action films due to his handicap as a bodybuilder. he has always been funny in his light roles, but Twins is the Oscar of his comedy.Schwarzenegger does wide-eyed innocence so well, which is acting, if you know how canny he is. the story is a perfect hijinx caper countering his ""superhuman abilities"" with DeVito's shenanigans/its a Reitman film, so there are warm-hearted moments, but i just could not stop laughing the whole way through. The comedy was perfect. and i normally hate comedy.give this one a go, even if you feel skeptical.",Twins
87,curt-simpkins,"Fun, underrated movie.",7,28 December 2018,"Danny and ""Ahnold"" as Twins? Preposterous premise but in this movie they make it work! This is actually a well made, well acted flick. Is it great? Not quite but it is entertaining and even somewhat moving at times. The supporting cast is very good and also help to make the plot at least somewhat believable (hey, it's a comedy movie, engage your ""suspension of disbelief)."" Kelly Preston is absolutely gorgeous in this and plays her part very well. There is a post on the ""goofs"" listing that states: ""The deal was for Beetroot to pay $5 million for the engine. At the end of the movie, the twins say the suitcase contained $4 million."" This is actually not a goof. Arnold's character never knew the exact contents of the case and when they declare $4 million, Vincent has a sly look on his face and a gleam in his eye meaning that he kept $1 million and only reported $4 million. The audience is expected to pick up on this so therefore this is not a goof.",Twins

I drop by all the time, and when I've just sen a movie, I often drop by with my prediction...and though I say so myself, I've got pretty good over the years. I guess 6.3, it's a 6.5; I guess 7.2, it's a 7.0.Just watched Twins for the first time in 20 years and came in with my prediction of 8.1 and what the...? 5.9? You have got to be kidding! Of its genre, Twins is damn near perfect. Great idea, brilliantly executed. An excellent script, with great one-liners and terrific plot twists along the way. And above all, one of the best buddy-twosomes outside of 48 Hours. How this ended up under 6 just defeats me.I was so amazed - and indignant - that I ended up doing my first IMDb review in years, in the hopes it might ease the score just a bit closer to where it deserves to be - which is 8, minimum.

Arnold (I'm not going to even try to spell his last name), plays the twin brother of Danny Devito. They were born of one mother and six fathers the fathers all had their sperm mixed together and injected into a women as sort of an experiment. The movie is basically about Arnold looking up his roots while Devito is trying to deliver an object worth five million dollars. There are many funny scenes and some action to boot. Of course, a lot of humor about Devito being small and Arnold being big I really liked this film. Great acting from both men and a fine performance from the sexy Kelly Preston.",Twins

It's a shame the gentle warmth he has has not been used more in film.The way Julius discovers life, and love, is just sweet.

I am a fan of Arnold and i have not liked many of his comedies or non-action films, but this one is surprisingly fun. Its not that this was an epic or super quoted comedy film but it is just warm-hearted. The reason why i loved the film is because Arnold's character Julius is just this perfect human being that you love. He is smart, strong, caring, loving, considerate polite amongst other quality traits. It is kinda sad that he gets exposed to the real world and all the scum in it. A good movie about 2 polar opposites who are brothers and come together to form what they had always wanted in life....a family. 9/10 stars.",Twins
102,mgarand-1,Honest review,5,4 September 2011,"OK lets be honest with a movie like this, it was a success back in the day but i attribute that to the fact that Schwarzenegger is in it. He made Predator the year before (best action film ever by the way) so he, at the time, was becoming a bigger and bigger star. I'm a big Arnold fan myself but even i have to admit that this film is pretty silly and kinda... well not kinda, it is corny. Arnold is the reason you watch this movie really but thats not to say Danny Devito doesn't hold his own, his wit and personality always explodes on the screen no matter what he's in. You could quote this movie with your friends and family but again they would be all Arnold quotes. Its not all bad though, there bits that make me laugh like the when you see Arnold come across a picture of Sylvester Stallone as 'Rambo' and laughs mockingly. They were big action star rivals at the time which is why its not Arnolds character 'Julius' laughing at Stallone, its Arnold! which is why it always makes me laugh. Also when when Schwarzenegger is singing 'yakety yak' very badly is funny. Also the 'I've only been driving an hour!' line makes me chuckle simply because of the way he says it. The other jokes are a little too obvious which feels like its really meant for a younger audience. As a kid watching this i loved it but with older eyes i still love it but i now watch it mainly for nostalgia value. If you want an 'comedy' staring Schwarzenegger then watch Commando, its excellent :) To some up, if your an Arnold fan you will watch this and like it all the same. Its a little dated now but if its on TV on a weekend evening and your having a night in, you'll watch it and enjoy it. Also Kelly Preston is smoking hot in it!. I gave it a 5 out of 10 as i think its a fair rating for this movie.Anyway (Arnold voice) 'great seeing you, catch ya later!'",Twins
