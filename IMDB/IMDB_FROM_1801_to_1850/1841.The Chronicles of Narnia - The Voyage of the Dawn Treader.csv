0,MartinHafer,Enjoyable.,7,22 November 2012,"I read ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" well over three decades ago, so the plot is not at all familiar to me. So, I can't really say how close this film is to the book. I noticed a few other reviewers commented how the film was NOT that similar--and perhaps that is the case.In this installment of the series (and probably the last judging by the box office receipts), Lucy, Edmund and their VERY annoying younger cousin, Eustace, are sucked into Narnia through a painting. The are soon rescued by a ship bearing Prince Caspian and they set off on an adventure--though for a while no one knows what that will be. Soon, they learn about some missing swords and they go off in search of them--not knowing that it once again bring them into contact with the White Witch AND that one of them will be turned into a dragon (really).Like the other Narnia films, this one is one action scene after another. While I liked the characters (particularly that mega-cool mouse), the film is NOT about the characters as much as the action scenes. So, if you are looking for cerebral, this film is not for you. And, I wouldn't recommend the film for very young viewers, as it's a bit intense. Overall, worth your time but not brilliant.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
1,TheLittleSongbird,The best of the movie series so far,8,16 March 2011,"I personally liked The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, but I wasn't so taken with Prince Caspian, while not a bad movie it could have been much better. I love the books, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was always my personal favourite, but Voyage of the Dawn Treader I loved just as much.As for this adaptation of Voyage of the Dawn Treader, while not completely perfect it was the best yet for me. It was a little too long however, and there is some wooden dialogue at times with Caspian's dialogue not as well fleshed out as it could have been. That said, there are some improvements over Prince Caspian. One is Ben Barnes, I found him bland and a bit too eager to please in Prince Caspian but here he is much more charismatic and warmer too.The pace is another improvement, I found it rather lethargic in the previous two entries particularly in Caspian making the story not as engaging as it should have been, but in Voyage of the Dawn Treader the pace is brisker and the story as well as truer in spirit is easier to get into. The direction feels more confident as well.The strengths of the previous two movies are also in abundance. Once again, Voyage of the Dawn Treader is visually stunning. The scenery is beautiful with a etheral and almost epic feel particularly in the sweeping action sequences, the cinematography is fluid and skillful and the special effects alone are what makes this entry the best of the series so far particularly with Dawn Treader which is gorgeously realised. The score is pleasant to listen to and memorable, it doesn't intrude too much and fits well with each scene.The acting is pretty much very good. Georgie Henley has improved hugely having grown in so much confidence, although Skandar Keynes isn't quite as enthusiastic this time around though he was decent. Will Poulter is delightfully obnoxious and selfish as Eustace, but his character transformation contrasted beautifully towards the end. Reepicheep comes close to stealing the show voiced very well by Simon Pegg, Tilda Swinton is still quite chilling in her brief appearance as the White Witch and Aslan is majestically voiced by Liam Neeson. The ending is also very well-done and quite moving.All in all, a surprisingly good film and the best of the series so far. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
2,bkoganbing,The Lessons Of Narnia,8,23 April 2011,"When Aslan announces that the older two Pevensie kids will not be returning to Narnia because they've learned all of lessons needed for their lives, my thought was why wasn't I allowed to go to Narnia when I was a kid? We should all get the chance to improve our characters in a place like that.Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes returning as Lucy and Edmund Pevensie are now visiting some relatives and one of them is this spoiled cousin Eustace. While looking at a seascape painting all of a sudden the room fills with water coming out of the picture. Soon among all kinds of floating debris in the room all three kids find themselves in the ocean and rescued by Prince Caspian from the last Narnia film.Ben Barnes is back as Caspian who is now a king and he's on the finest ship of the line of the Narnian Navy, the Dawn Treader. It's not clear why the kids who rescued Narnia twice before have been summoned back or just why they've got this stowaway among them. Still there they are on this ancient sailing vessel and cousin Eustace is screaming for the British consul.C.S. Lewis created quite a character in Eustace it will be interesting to see how he develops in future. I think the inspiration that Lewis got might have come from a more cynical author Mark Twain when he created Sid Sawyer, little goody two shoes spoiled brother of Tom Sawyer. Will Poulter plays Eustace quite nicely and the Tom Sawyer comparison is unmistakable.When the Dawn Treader arrives where it's supposed to, a strange mist has taken a whole lot of folks away, they've seemingly disappeared. Now we know why the Pevensies are back and their mission is clear to save Narnia again.20th Century Fox took over from Walt Disney Studios production of this third Chronicles Of Narnia film and the transition is seamless with the same high standard in production values and good story carrying over from the first two films. I think C.S. Lewis would be proud the way The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader was handled.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
3,Leofwine_draca,"Passable, but far from great",9,4 April 2013,"The third and final instalment of the recent big-budget adaptations of C. S. Lewis's NARNIA books, VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER is a disappointment in comparison with the excellent PRINCE CASPIAN that came before it. As a film, it's merely so-so, a fast-paced but rather unengaging children's adventure film that rarely rises above the norm for the genre.The plotting sees the older kids from the first two films jettisoned while the youngsters (Edmund and Lucy) now take their place. Once again, they team up with Caspian (Ben Barnes, never more than one dimensional) to go on an epic maritime adventure, tackling sea monsters, magic and a mysterious green mist en route.The problem with VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER is that we've seen it all before. This effects-packed movie features all manner of CGI backdrops and one or two CGI beasties, but it was all done bigger and better in the last two films. The storyline is predictable, the action scenes all feel very safe and by rote, and only one or two of the sub-plots garner interest. Will Poulter, as annoying newcomer Eustace, bags the only decent role in the script and everyone else is just bland.It's not all bad: the movie has a decent pace, the introductory scenes are very well realised (I loved the way the kids access Narnia this time around) and it's as colourful and involving as any PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN film you might name. But compared to the epic-feeling PRINCE CASPIAN, this slight, slightly overlaboured production feels disappointing and the return of fan favourites like the White Witch and Aslan has become a bore.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
4,Leofwine_draca,A masterful conclusion to the trilogy,9,8 January 2018,"The third and final instalment of the recent big-budget adaptations of C. S. Lewis's NARNIA books, VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER is a mini-masterpiece in comparison to the strong PRINCE CASPIAN that came before it. As a film, it's fast-paced and engaging, a children's adventure film that feels refreshingly old-fashioned and much like the classic adaptations of Edith Nesbit, for example. I should note that I haven't read the book.The plotting sees the older kids from the first two films jettisoned while the youngsters (Edmund and Lucy) now take their place. Once again, they team up with Caspian (Ben Barnes, never more than one dimensional) to go on an epic maritime adventure, tackling sea monsters, magic and a mysterious green mist en route.A potential problem with VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER is that we've seen it all before, but this matters little when the film is so entertaining from the word go. This effects-packed movie features all manner of CGI backdrops and one or two CGI beasties, similar to the Harryhausen epics of old. Will Poulter, as newcomer cousin Eustace, gives a masterful and hilarious performance and a real star-making turn. The movie has a decent pace, the introductory scenes are very well realised (I loved the way the kids access Narnia this time around) and it's more colourful and involving as any PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN film you might name. For me, the trilogy ended on a high.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
5,SnoopyStyle,Lackluster adventure,6,22 February 2014,"The kids are scattered in the midst of WWII. Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keynes) are forced to live with their annoying cousin Eustace (Will Poulter). Then a painting in their room starts coming to life. The water in the painting floods the room and sweeps all three kids to Narnia where they are rescued by prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) and The Dawn Treader. They find Narnia at peace. Caspian is on his way to the Lone Island where the seven lords of Telmar, who were loyal to his father, escaped to after his uncle tries to kill them. No one has had news of them, and Caspian wants to investigate. There they find a green mist that takes people away.The adventure feels very lackluster. The danger isn't up to standard. The green mist is done weakly. It's not very scary. There is a lot of time spent on the ship without much action. The swashbuckling action is passable. It's probably good enough for a kid's movie. I do like the fact that only two of the original kids go back to Narnia. I never really liked all the bickering. And Lucy has a great subplot of wanting to be as beautiful as Susan.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
6,claudio_carvalho,"Great Adventure, Awesome CGI, Poor Acting",7,22 April 2011,"Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keynes) are stranded in Cambridge, living in the house of their obnoxious cousin Eustace (Will Poulter), while the grown-ups Susan and Peter are living in the USA with their parents. When a painting of a ship sailing on the sea of Narnia overflows water in their room, Lucy, Edmund and Eustace are transported to the ocean of Narnia and rescued by King Caspian (Ben Barnes) and the crew of the ship The Dawn Treader. Caspian explains that Narnia has been in peace for three years but before he took his throne back, his uncle tried to kill the seven lords of Telmar, who were the closest and most loyal friends of his father. They fled to The Lone Island and no one has ever heard anything about them. Now Caspian is seeking out the lords of Telmar with his Captain Drinian (Gary Sweet), the rat Reepicheep and his loyal men. Sooner they discover that an evil form of green mist is threatening Narnia and the siblings and their cousin join Caspian in a quest to retrieve the seven swords of the seven lords of Telmar to save Narnia from evil. ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" is a great adventure supported by awesome CGI and the delightful Reepicheep that ""steals the film"". Unfortunately the acting of the wooden lead trio - Skandar Keynes, Georgie Henley and Ben Barnes – is very poor. Surprisingly Will Poulter and his weird eyebrow is a good comedian and is very funny. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""As Crônicas de Nárnia: A Viagem do Peregrino da Alvorada"" (""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Pilgrim"")",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
7,kosmasp,Consistent,6,7 September 2011,"To me the Narnia trilogy has been consistent. Consistent on being decent. On the other hand, they just let go of the Spanish accent for the Prince. It's beyond me, why they did that. Maybe it gets explained in the books (which I haven't read).We get a new kid and he is playing the ""flawed"" part, that one of the other kids had played in the previous movie(s). Some kids got too old though. I'm not sure what the time-line of the books are, but you can see that there is a reason why it would be hard to swallow, that they are still in for kids adventures.I'm not even sure if there will be another one. But 3-D was not necessary for this one.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
8,classicsoncall,"""Come on, let's meet our destiny"".",7,17 September 2011,"I'm not a follower of the Chronicles of Narnia books, so I don't have the same emotional response to the films that I read about from other reviewers. So as an outsider looking in, I wouldn't have any idea that this entry in the movie series doesn't really follow the book as mentioned by a number of folks. My reaction to the picture was that I found it watchable enough, but without really getting into it, if you know what I mean. I thought it a bit of a downer that all four Pevensie siblings weren't around for this one, replaced in part by the irritating cousin aptly named Scrubb (Will Poulter). I knew he was doing a credible acting job because I didn't care for him much, which in itself was a red flag indicating that by the time the picture was over, he would have redeemed his character through some noble act and see the error of his ways. The best element of these Narnia films is the technical wizardry that creates the special effects, readily apparent here in each of the set pieces. And I have to say, I haven't seen as ugly a monster as that sea serpent in a long time. Overall however, I just didn't connect emotionally with this picture the way I did with the first in the series, and it didn't leave me hungry for more. Nor did it leave me with the feeling that a repeat viewing would be in order.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
9,jboothmillard,The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,6,27 April 2011,"From director Michael Apted (Coal Miner's Daughter, Extreme Measures, Enigma, The World Is Not Enough), I thought this wouldn't be that great, and I didn't realise there were meant to be only two of the children from previous films, but I watched when I saw the critics gave it a higher rating compared to the other two. Basically the Pevensie siblings Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) are spending a dull holiday with their cousin Eustace Clarence Scrubb (Will Poulter), when they are suddenly transported to Narnia, picked up in the ocean by the ship the Dawn Treader. King Caspian (Ben Barnes) and large brave mouse Reepicheep (Simon Pegg, replacing Eddie Izzard) are travelling to save the seven lords of the kingdom who Miraz banished, so they find the Lone Islands, where people are sold as slaves. While Caspian and Edmund are in prison, Lucy and Eustace are sold as slaves, any slaves not sold to people are taken out to ocean and disappear in the mysterious green mist, but all of them are rescued. On another island Lucy gets captured by the Dufflepuds, and the force her into a magician's lair, where she finds a book of incantations and reads one or two to create snow and beauty, and one particular spell forces Aslan the lion (Liam Neeson) to remind her that it is because of her Narnia was found in the first place. Next they land on a volcanic island, where Caspian, Edmund and Lucy discover a magical pool that turns anything into pure gold, and Eustace finds some treasure which he plans to steal, only to be turned into a dragon that briefly attacks the Dawn Treader. They eventually find Aslan's Table where the swords they have retrieved are meant to be placed, but there is still one missing, where they are met by star turned beauty Lilliandil (Laura Brent) who guides them round the dark island, and they find the last of the seven lords. He warns them not to think of a fear or it will become reality, but Edmund fails to do this and they are attacked by a sea serpent. Aslan changes Eustace back to into a human after being wounded, and he places the last sword on the table, causing the mist to disappear and awake the sleeping lords. The final scene sees all the heroes with Aslan on a beach with a large wave of water, Caspian refuses to go to the other side where return is not possible, but Reepicheep goes, and Lucy, Edmund and Eustace return home. Also starring Anna Popplewell as Susan Pevensie, William Moseley as Peter Pevensie and Tilda Swinton as Jadis, The White Witch. The two young stars from the two previous films are still reliable, the new addition Poulter is good fun, and the other characters are likable, the story has some memorable moments, and of course the special effects are crucial for plenty of action, I guess I can see why this four stars rather than three, it is a worthwhile action fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for Carrie Underwood's ""There's A Place For Us"". Good!",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

11,CinemaSerf,Narnia takes to the water...,7,31 March 2020,"Whilst this third in the adaptations of CS Lewis' ""Narnia"" stories is still enjoyable to watch; it's fair to say that it bears little resemblance to the original book and that is a shame. We only have two ""Pevensie"" children (""Lucy"" & ""Edmund"") summoned back in this film alongside, accidentally, their cowardly but loudmouthed cousin ""Eustace"" (Will Poulter). They arrive just in time to be rescued from the middle of the sea by a passing King ""Caspian"" (Ben Barnes) on his ship ""The Dawn Treader"" and wonder why they have been recalled. We soon find out that they must all get to the ""Lone Islands"" before a green mist envelops the whole kingdom. We've plenty of action, battles, some mysterious invisible dwarves and even a wee bit of excess testosterone en route to quite an exciting conclusion. Insofar as it goes, the kids - now, really young adults - do well (Poulter is quite entertaining as their whinging, spoilt relative) as do Barnes and this time Simon Pegg takes over as ""Reepicheep"". The effects are definitely better, but they do need to be - the story isn't so good and struggles at times to get up any decent head of steam. It is still colourful and fun, though - but sadly demonstrative that the franchise has now run out of oomph!",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
12,dbborroughs,The pieces work better than the film as a whole does,7,9 January 2011,"Third Narnia film is a good looking CGI filled film about collecting the seven swords of the great lords and laying them at the table of Arslan.Good but rather bland film seems like the typical family fantasy film that has ""good for you"" written all over it.While not bad, its not particularly compelling, its the sort of film that will probably kill off the franchise because it simply isn't exciting enough to warrant another visit by audiences.As you can probably tell I'm underwhelmed by the film...even with the great set pieces.To be honest the films construction as a series of set pieces (slave trade, Invisible creatures,dragon,last temptation, sea monster...etc) never allows the film to build up a head of steam. Blame the source novel which is an episodic adventure.Its not bad (annoying cousin aside- he almost sinks the film single handedly), but its not as compelling as it should have been....(an aside- having the Blue Star being a plot point is not a good sign to anyone who has ever seen Galaxina because ever each time its said I went AHHH AHHH!!!) And why the hell is this thing in 3D other than to get a buck or two?",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
13,zardoz-13,"Kids Will Appreciate This ""Chronicles"" More Than Adults",7,13 December 2010,"""The World Is Not Enough"" director Michael Apted's family-friendly, PG-rated, fantasy film ""The Chronicles of Naria: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" is the third entry in the C.S. Lewis franchise of Christian-themed adventure epics. Initially, ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" (2005) coined $745 million worldwide for Walt Disney Productions. The first entry introduced audiences to the four Pevensies, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. They stumbled onto Naria when they plunged into an apparently conventional wardrobe to escape a furious housekeeper after they broke a window with a cricket ball. This juvenile quartet discovered a world of whimsy, a majestic lion named Aslan, a wicked White Witch, and loquacious beavers and wolves. Unfortunately, the second outing in the series ""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"" (2008) generated only half as much loot, a mite more than $419 million, so the House of Mouse forsook the franchise. Twentieth Century Fox stepped in to salvage the series with ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader."" Not only did ""Dawn Treader"" rake in the most receipts for its debut weekend, approximately $24 million, with an international haul of some $81 million. Nevertheless, this seafaring opus still has high seas to brave to recoup its $155 million production cost. Suffice to say, children will probably enjoy this episodic, lightweight, island hopping endeavor. Meanwhile, adults may tire of what amounts to a juvenile special effects laden spectacle with a scavenger search for seven swords.Remember, the Narnia films take place in a fantasy world where animals chat, magic is commonplace, and good challenges evil in an eternal war. ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" finds franchise regulars Lucy Pevensie (Georgie Henley) and Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keynes) being packed off to Cambridge to live with their aunt and uncle as World War II continues to rage. Their mother and father are away in America with Susan. Meanwhile, Professor Kirke is helping Peter prepare for his university entrance exams. Initially, Edmund tries to pass himself off as older than he is so that he can get into the army. Things don't pan out, and Edmund joins Lucy as they are sent off to live with their objectionable cousin Eustace Scrubb. Eustace gives new meaning to brat. He is a thoroughly pusillanimous fellow, and he ridicules both Lucy and Edmund, particularly for their flights of fancy. You see, Eustace is a down-to-earth, literal type of guy for whom seeing is believing. In other words, he lacks the faith to see beyond what his mind cannot comprehend, and he berates Lucy and Edmund without end. Things take a turn for the worse for Eustace when he argues with his cousins about a painting of an exotic sailing ship. Mind you, everybody is alarmed when water crashes out of the painting into the room, and our threesome find themselves swimming for their lives. The sea water rises to the ceiling in Lucy's tiny bedroom. Just when things look really bad for them, they find themselves floundering around in the middle of the ocean with the Dawn Treader, a dragon-prowed, single-mast ship, bearing down on them and Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes, sans his Spanish accent), the new king of Narnia, hailing them from aboard the ship. Caspian rescues Lucy and Edmund, while the sword-wielding mouse Reepicheep (Simon Pegg of ""Hot Fuzz"") saves the obnoxious Eustace from drowning.This entertaining opening scene with the Dawn Treader painting and the sensational finale between a gigantic sea beast and our heroes qualify as the film's highlights. Indeed, the sea beast scene may prove too intense for some youngsters. This exciting scene looks like something more fitting for the outlandish ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise. Mind you, Apted and his three scenarists provide more than enough twists and turns throughout the 115 minute running time to maintain interest. For the record, ""Dawn Treader"" is the shortest as well as the least ambitious of the trilogy. ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" clocked in at 222 minutes while ""Prince Caspian"" came in at 149 minutes. Scenarists Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who collaborated on the screenplays of the two previous ""Narnia"" movies, are abetted by ""Queen of the Damned"" scribe Michael Petroni. Altogether, the trio stick rather closely to the vintage C.S. Lewis novel. The sea serpent scene is pushed to the finale of the film so the action builds to a climax. Nevertheless, Lewis aficionados should find this cinematic adaptation sufficiently suitable. Most of the action in ""Dawn Treader"" has been diluted to accommodate its juvenile demographic. ""The chief problem is that this Narnian nonsense suffers from the shortage of a fiendish flesh and blood villain, such as the White Witch, who materializes only momentarily for a cameo. Instead, the most villainous thing turns out to be a green mist that preys on the imagination and fears of an individual. Nonetheless, the third ""Narnia"" outing boasts some unusual creatures, such as the one-footed dwarfs who are invisible.Despite the gorgeous cinematic compositions, the 3-D effects won't take your breath away. The best shot involves an arrow streaking toward a sea serpent. Sadly, nothing flies out at you the way it should in a truly good 3-D film, but again this is essentially an adolescent opus. Nevertheless, ""The Last of the Mohicans"" lenser Dante Spinotti makes everything worth staring at. The newest character in the franchise turns out to be the most interesting, while the heroes and heroine seem a bit dull. Glossy production values, Apted's sure-handed helming, and Spinotti's widescreen cinematography help make the third Narnian epic an above average example of escapism.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
14,neil-476,An excellent adaptation,9,13 December 2010,"The third Narnia movie. under the auspices of 20th Century Fox rather than Disney, adapts what may be the most popular of the Narnia novels, and the final one to involve any of the Pevensie children.And ""adapt"" is the right word, because the film takes some liberties with the book. The main one of these is a sensible one - a threat is introduced to provide a reason for the children to be there and to provide a more coherent link than the simple ongoing quest to find the missing Lords as per the book.And underlying both book and film is the story of the redemption of Eustace Scrubb. Will Poulter as Eustace is a triumph - the boy is odious, but very, very human.Skandar Keynes is, unfortunately still underwhelming - I'm afraid I find his overstressed sibilants terribly distracting. Georgie Henley does better as Lucy although, again, I am possibly out of step with others in not finding her quite as wonderful as everyone else. Ben Barnes seems a little more at ease as King Caspian. Simon Pegg is a more than adequate voice replacement for Eddie Izzard as Reepicheep.The film looks great, is a nice mixture of action, humour, and spectacle, and is well paced. I have read opinions that the Christian allegory is maybe a little more overt than previously - as an agnostic, the allegory is not exclusively Christian, it seems to me.The 3D has its moments but is far from essential.Finally, it was wonderful to see the Pauline Baynes illustrations from the novel used as the background for the closing credits.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

They are joined reluctantly by their uptight cousin Eustace. From there they embark upon a voyage that involves a green mist that brings reality to their greatest fears. Director Michael Apted has accomplished much in his long career with films such as Coal Miner's Daughter and Amazing Grace but here he is backed by phenomenal special effects that highlight the dangerous voyage of sea serpents, dragons, treasure, and the invaluable presence of the lion Aslan. The screenplay unfortunately is not as tight as previous films although the leads are on top. Georgie Henley as Lucy desires the beauty of her sister Susan but must learn to accept herself as is. Skandar Keynes as Edmund struggles with greed and the position in Narnia verses his home life on Earth. Ben Barnes as Prince Caspian is underwritten here and only seem along for the ride. The biggest problem is Will Poulter's stern bully attitude as Eustace that is forced and over the top. His dragon transformation bares interests but his switch to nobleman seems predictable and contrived. Liam Neeson once again provides the wisdom of Aslan. Corny and beneath the other two, otherwise this outing is an entertaining quest of the inner struggle of self. Score: 7 ½ / 10",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
16,siderite,For Aslaan and Narnia!,6,27 November 2011,"Why do they bother making book adaptations? I have not read the book, but this film is like a cross between a video game and the story of the Argonauts. They get a quest, it involves seven swords, they use a ship to go from island to island and finding all kinds of sub-quest and in the end Aslaan, that condescending jerk of a lion, appears for a bit and spouts the same vague and useless junk.The special effects are great, I give you that, but it also makes it more like a video game. I swear I could half-see the health bar over the boss level monsters some times. The acting and dialogues are ridiculous and the uplifting music really dumb. I do know the audience for this film is not the most adult and I also know what they must do in order to wow it, but they are going waaay overboard with it and it gets annoying at the best of times.Bottom line: fairy tale issue block buster, with great special effects and getting very close to likable, but also giving me the sensations that a young boy being seduced by a charismatic priest must have.

S. Lewis's original novel was his attempt to write his own seafaring myth based on some of the Norse sagas and Greek legends such as the Odyssey and the story of Jason and the Argonauts. It is very episodic in structure, relating a series of adventures which befall the travellers on each stage of their voyage. Like all Lewis's novels it contains a strong element of didactic religious allegory, each adventure representing a different form of temptation against which the characters must fight. Unlike the other ""Narnia"" stories there is no central villain; the main theme is the struggle against temptation so evil is shown to come from within rather than without.This picaresque structure would probably not have worked in a film, so the producers of ""Dawn Treader"" made some changes to Lewis's story. The film keeps the theme of the voyage across the uncharted ocean to the east of Narnia and the quest to discover what has become of the Seven Lost Lords, but uses this story as the framework for another metaphysical good-and- evil struggle between the great lion Aslan (for which read Christ) and Jadis the White Witch (for which read the Devil). Jadis does not feature in the novel, but here she is responsible for the mysterious ""green mist"" which threatens Narnia. Another change to Lewis's plot involves Eustace who at one point is magically transformed into a dragon. In the book he is fairly quickly turned back into human form, but here he remains a dragon for most of the film, only becoming human again near the end. This change was doubtless made to allow for some spectacular action sequences in which Eustace uses his new shape to help his friends, particularly in the battle with the gigantic sea- serpent.When I first read the book as a child I disliked the fact that Lewis omitted Peter and Susan; he probably thought that children would not want to read about teenagers (as they would now have been) and wanted to make room for the new character of Eustace. Here, however, their absence seems to matter less, as Skandar Keynes (Edmund) and Georgie Henley (Lucy) were always the best of the young cast in the first two instalments of the series. Ben Barnes as Caspian is a lot better here than he was in ""Prince Caspian"", where he was particularly wooden, and there is an excellent contribution from Will Poulter as Eustace. This is a difficult role to play as in the early part of the story Eustace is an obnoxious spoilt brat who alienates his cousins and just about everyone else he comes across, before transmogrification into a dragon markedly improves his character for the better. Poulter rather underplays the obnoxiousness of the early Eustace compared with the way the character is portrayed in the book, but this is probably all to the good; had he been too unpleasant to begin with it would have made it difficult for us to accept his later reformation.The visual effects and action sequences are well done, but there are still problems with ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"". One of the main problems with adapting the ""Narnia"" stories in general is how to downplay their rather preachy, pious tone- the main reason why I didn't like them as a youngster- while keeping Lewis's imaginative vision. Another problem specific to this story in particular is how to adapt Lewis's loose, episodic plot to something that will work in dramatic as opposed to novel form. I never really felt that Michael Apted, who took over from Andrew Adamson as director, and the scriptwriters solved either of these problems. ""Dawn Treader"", in fact, comes across as rather more pious in tone than either of the first two instalments and its overall dramatic structure is not really satisfactory. And why did they replace Eddie Izzard as the voice of the warrior-mouse Reepicheep? (If a thing ain't broke, don't fix it). ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" still remains the best of the ""Narnia"" series. 7/10",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
18,lasttimeisaw,The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader: 3D hurts,5,8 December 2010,"I watched this film at Hong Kong IFC cinema, a 3D version by dint of the fact that we will not be able to watch it in mainland China until next January (the opening date of HK is even 8 days earlier than North America). After the lukewarm box office of Narnia 2 in 2008, the ill-fated third one suddenly became a hot potato, dispatched by Disney and finally taken over by 20th Century Fox, but still it has fail to reach the level of Harry Potter series by a large mile. Firstly I have to admit that I fell asleep during the film (I cannot remember when was the last time this kind of thing happened), I felt rather guilty for being such an amateur cinephile. I figure that I missed about 15 minutes in the middle section (maybe I should blame it on the uncomfortable 3D glasses). One thing for sure, this film aims to a younger demography than its precedents. SFX is good but not marvelous, after watching so many fantasy/adventure fables on screen, I doubt that is there anything could open my eyes and blow my mind like Avatar has done it lat year. Seriously, one should not count too much on Narnia series, I think the Christmas time will do good favor to its box office performance as its a family film like Alvin and the Chipmunks series (2007 & 2009), adults may eschew it but the family crowds could be the most potential consumers. As the 3D fever is at its annex, I think the next move is to improve the glasses, especially for people already with glasses, double pair is rather make me unwell, I survived with Journey to the Center of the Earth (2008), Monsters Vs. Aliens (2009), Avatar (2009), but this time, it undermines my decision to watch another 3D in the future. All in all, the film doesn't impress me much and the cast also has little charisma to keep its audience faithful to its fourth work.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
19,Hellmant,The Voyage of the YAWN Treader!,7,10 December 2010,"'THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The third in the 'NARNIA' film series based on the third book of the same name. After the less than stellar performance of the second chapter at the box office (it only made about half as much as the blockbuster original) the Walt Disney Company has backed out of producing this and any further installments and a new director, veteran filmmaker Michael Apted, has been hired to replace the less experienced director, Andrew Adamson, of the original two films. Many critics that were less than overwhelmed by the original two films (which I happened to really like) thought that the film series could follow in the footsteps of the 'HARRY POTTER' franchise and get better after the early films once a better director was brought on board. While I do believe that was the case with 'POTTER' I don't think that's the case here. Apted fails to reach the standard set by the first two films and actually produces an inferior product, the weakest of the three. I personally had no problem with Adamson's direction and very much enjoyed the first two films (although I'm not a fan of the books, being that I haven't read any of them).As the story opens Lucy and Edmund (once again played by Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes) are staying with their mean obnoxious cousin (played by Will Poulter of 'SON OF RAMBOW' fame). When a painting comes to life on the wall in Lucy's room the three are sucked back into Narnia and picked up by Caspian, now a king (once again played by Ben Barnes), on his ship the 'Dawn Treader'. They join with him on his journey across the sea to the end of the world to find and save the seven lost Lords of Narnia. They stop at multiple islands facing different tests and magical spells and creatures and of course learn to grow and mature along the way.The film is full of spectacular visuals which are enhanced in 3D (which is worth the extra ticket price in my opinion) but a little light on action. This wouldn't be a problem if the story and characters were interesting but they just aren't. The film moves along at a very slow pace and is almost devoid of emotion, the scenes that really try hard to touch the viewer fall a little flat (unlike the first two films). The acting is adequate but nothing special, with the exception of Poulter who steals every scene he's in. The film is neither exciting nor involving and I don't think it's the writing's fault. I think the problem is the director, he just doesn't know how to deliver this kind of material. The film feels a little systematic and possibly too faithful to the source material (although I wouldn't know). If directors like Danny Boyle can make a film about a man trapped under a rock the entire time and Rodrigo Cortes can make an entire film with a man trapped in a coffin an exciting blast making a film like this, set in a magical fantasy world, seem interesting shouldn't be that hard but it seems as though that's the case. It's still a visual feast though and has enough awe and wonder to make it worth while and probably please most young viewers. The rest of us will most likely be a little bored. Being a fan of the first two films I expected a lot more, although I don't think it's an entirely lost effort. Hopefully the series will turn back around with the next installment.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDOVPaC9JIk",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
20,thesar-2,Break this Dawn,2,18 June 2011,"While the world was a fan of Lord of the Ringleader or Harry Pothead, I clung to the Chronicles of Narnia movies. After all, I idolized (just one of the) book(s) as a kid: The Lion, The Witch & the Wardrobe.I both read the book and watched the British cartoon. I never went past that chapter (of seven?) but I am still very fond of that and when the modern-day first movie came out, I loved it. I even liked part II: Prince Caspian.Despite my liking of the first two movies and the chance they wouldn't make a third chapter, due to studio battles over box-office, I skipped #3: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (TVOTDT) in the theatres. (PAT ON BACK) I just saved some money.While visually stunning, and I mean: this CGI-heavy sequel was TOP NOTCH, the story sucked, the dumbed down plot/moral and almost complete lack of action/war scenes (you'd find fun in the first two) made this a tedious ""adventure."" In fact, I'd just call it a chapter of a series you can't wait to get past to get on with the series.One of the biggest problems I find, and again, this is coming from someone who hasn't read all the books, is that the original author, C.S. Lewis, apparently wrote himself into a corner with the stipulation: no one over a certain age can enter the land of Narnia.I enjoyed the four brothers/sisters together in the original two movies. They all fit and had great chemistry together. Here, in TVOTDT, only the weaker of the four, Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) are allowed into the magical land leaving behind the superior brother and sister duo: Susan (Anna Popplewell) and Peter (William Moseley.) Ho-hum. And it wouldn't be so bad, but they introduced another young boy, Eustace (Will Poulter) that will undoubtedly be the ""next generation"" of Narnia-adventurers in the future installments. HE WAS SOOO ANNOYING, not to mention hard to understand with such a thick English accent.That's neither here nor there, in regards to the dialect, he was just so unfun to watch and I'm stopping here (with TVOTDT) so I don't have to see more of himand especially less of the more interesting children.The basic plot (and its basic – it's really for the G-rated audience) revolves around Lucy, Edmund and brat Eustace thrown into Narnia after the war (featured in parts one and two) is over, but there's an evil presence that's stealing people.There's a mystery involved with that, a large ship that just sails around and a fantastic mouse named Reepicheep (voiced very nicely by Simon Pegg) who should appear in the Shrek franchise, but does just fine here as the swashbuckling teacher to Eustace.Gone is the big battle scenes and in comes the ""heart"" and ""message"" from the Lion (once again, voiced by Liam Neeson.)This movie is for (incredibly) die-hard fans of the books and not necessarily for ""new"" (like me) fans of the movies. It's sad, though. I am a huge CGI-hater, and this movie contains some of the most breathtaking CGI-effects I've seen. Too bad they wasted it on a movie that should've gone straight to Bluray.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
21,MLDinTN,It would be OK for younger kids...,4,21 December 2011,"but it didn't have enough to keep my attention. This story is definitely lackluster than the first film that was more of an epic. This story is more for kids obsessed with pirates. The majority of the movie takes place on a boat as the characters sail around to various islands looking for swords. This time only Lucy and Edmund go to Narnia with a new character, their snobby cousin Eustace. Eustace is the comedy in the movie as he argues with a talking rat, looks for the British embassy, and turns into a dragon. And at the end, they find the lion again.FINAL VERDICT: boring, I only recommend it for those under 14.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

It's not as good as the first two films were, but it still is a respectable entry in the series. This film does not have as much action or any real battle scenes, but this is more of an adventure film and a film that has a heavy theme regarding family.This third installment is about a evil, in a form of a mist, trying to take over Narnia. Lucy and Edmund returns along with their bratty cousin, Eustace to join Aslan, Caspian, Reepicheep, and the other Narnian folks to stop this evil.The acting is solid. The one thing that stuck out to me is how Georgie Henley has matured as Lucy. She and Skandar Peynes were good at recapturing their roles.Overall, this was a good fantasy-filled film. It's a step down from the previous Narnia films but it still is very enjoyable. Despite the lack of action scenes, the special effects were well-done. I also liked how images from the novels were displayed in the end credits. I am disappointed that this film did not so better business here in America.

In order to save Narnia from evil spirits and rescue those that have been lost they must find all 7 legendary swords. Having never read the books in this series I have no idea if this is actually the last movie or not, but I have a feeling it is. Not only because of the way it ended, but because this movie didn't do nearly as well as the others. I did enjoy this series, but I will admit they didn't really stand out as amazing to me. I liked them all about the same, they all were a little slow with great action at the end. Unlike the ""Harry Potter"" series this one is geared toward a fun family night, Disney mixed with C.S. Lewis has something to do with that. I think sadly, that is part of the reason that it's not as popular as that series or the ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy. This is still a worthwhile rent the whole family can enjoy.

25,tabuno,Doesn't Quite Take Advantage Of Its Potential,7,18 January 2019,"12 December 2010. In a major contrast to HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS Part I 2D, THE CHRONICLES OF NARIA: THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER 3D, had more connective tissue and a plot outline that avoided the seemingly random, disjointed presentation of its material. Nevertheless, this version of NARIA did not take advantage of its 3D perspective and in most instances it didn't seem to make much of difference in the experience except for the negative annoyance of wasting money for the increased cost of tickets. While there was some character development and the effort at a message in this movie compared to HARRY POTTER, NARIA also didn't advantage of sticking with the emotional and character development, the heightened compelling tension as found in the original THE LION, WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE (2005). This version of NARIA also had a few logical flaws (how Narnians guarded themselves). Nevertheless, the story was well told, the obnoxious new boy in the movie and his voice-over never really was played over the top and his presence added not detracted from the movie as many of such characters can easily do in movies. The 3D special effects while not added any enhanced viewing experience the effects themselves were a complement as background to the movie instead of the more pretentious and perhaps over-use in HARRY POTTER.

26,The-Sarkologist,A surprising film that doesn't follow the book.,8,12 August 2012,"I must say that for a movie that doesn't really follow the book all that well the creators seemed to have actually kept the major themes in place. As you are probably aware, C.S. Lewis wrote his Narnia Chronicles as a form of Christian analogy and Voyage of the Dawntredder is no different. However there are a number of differences, such as Eustace becoming a dragon. In the book he doesn't remain a dragon for that long however in the movie he actually spends half of the film as a dragon. Also, the whole concept of the green mist never actually appears in the film, and I also suspect that the quest to find the missing lords is also somewhat different.This film has Peter and Susan off in America, which was foreshadowed in the previous film, and a new hero, Eustace Scrubb, joining the children. Eustace is a very scientifically minded boy who scoffs and laughs at Edmund and Lucy about their fantasy world of Narnia. However it suddenly comes to light that Narnia is real when Eustace finds himself there along with the others, though it he takes quite some time to actually accept the reality of the situation that he is in. Reepicheep and Prince Caspian also return for this story.The Dawntredder is a boat, and in fact the first Narnian boat for a long time, that has been built so that Caspian may go on a quest to find the seven lost lords of Narnia, who were sent into exile just prior to the previous film. Narnia is now at peace to Caspian feels that he is now able to travel across the ocean to attempt to find these lords. However, their first port of call, the Lonely Islands, finds them not only confronting pirates, but also confronting a mysterious green mist that seems to eat people up. So, the crew of the Dawntredder set off to locate the lords and also uncover the mystery of the mist.I really do applaud the creators of this film for sticking to the Christian allegory, though there are still a lot of hints of a more secularist religion woven through it. One of the major themes is the theme of redemption, and this is played out with Eustace. As in the previous stories, the children travel to Narnia to learn something about themselves and to grow as a result. This is the essence of the quest narrative, and by bringing the children across from our world, it helps us understand how a simply story can benefit us.One of the major challenges is faced by Edmund, who feels inadequate as he is always playing second fiddle to somebody else. In the first to films he was second to High King Peter, however in this film, while Edmund strictly outranks Prince Caspian, it comes to light that because Caspian is commander of the Dawntredder, he is once again subservient to him. As such, Edmund must come to learn his place in the world, and that while he may never be truly in charge, he still has an important role to play.As for Caspian, he, being the current king, has to learn his rightful place in the world, which means not jumping onto a boat and going off on wild adventures. His place is on the throne ruling Narnia. This is a mistake that is explored in Shakespeare's Richard II. King Richard goes off on an adventure leaving somebody else in charge of England, only to discover that when he returns, the regent does not want to give up his throne. While Caspian reaches his destination, Aslan reminds him of his duties as a king, and while he does have the option to continue, he accepts his role and responsibility, and chooses to return.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

28,Dr_Coulardeau,"Children have to grow up, thanks God",10,1 January 2011,"This latest episode of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is bringing to an end a generation of children who have been confronted to that magic world. In the present context the original meaning of WW2 is put aside, particularly for children.For children it is first of all a magic world where animals speak and can be your friends, where children can become heroes and fight fundamental battles for a better future for everyone. These adventures are dangerous but marvelous and the final destination of these adventures is to liberate the world of evil forces.The objective is to defend Narnia against external menaces but in this film, maybe even more than in the previous films the menace against this marvelous world comes from the inside of those who want to defend it. The evil forces are over there far away in some distant island but they have no power by themselves and they find all the power they need to dominate the world in the greed, envy, jealousy and other negative attitudes that reside and develop in the minds of the defenders of Narnia.That is the main lesson for the children: you have to learn how to dominate these negative feelings you nurture day after day in your egotism.Then all the rest is nothing but adventure and its dangers are not real dangers, at the worst they are temptations. But in this world there are some guides you have to follow, a blue star like a blue fairy in some other old story, the lion Aslan who can intervene to save a lost situation at the very last minute, the mission and its objective of bringing the seven swords of seven old knights to the table of Aslan, and the goal of that mission which is to liberate people who have been taken hostages by the evil forces. But these forces don't have any human or physical form, at best a vapor in the air and an image that springs from our own phantasms.The trick of the story is to put it upside down from beginning to end. The grouchy unwilling participant at the start will become the hero who saves the situation. He will take the form a dragon, an allusion to Siegfried's dragon Fafner, but a good dragon, an allusion to other dragons in many stories. His worst enemy is a mouse at the beginning who will become his best friend at the end.That's the second lesson for children. One day comes with that important change you must accept: not to be children any more and to assume the responsibilities the world has entrusted you with or is going to entrust you with as adults. A sad change but inevitable.For adults this film, like the original story, has to be put in perspective with T.S. Eliot and his ""Murder in the Cathedral"" where he denounces human evil forces, the fascists and Nazis and calls us to fight against them, and with H.G. Wells who develops a Marxist form of social Darwinism in which the working class becomes an underground species that are the predators of the bourgeoisie that has become another species on the surface. The answer of H.G. Wells to that evil is a severe eugenic policy eliminating all racial and social groups that may endanger the balanced development of civilization. C.S. Lewis believes we are all different, each one of us must accept what they are and what all others are. Differences are the richness of this human vision.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

Sadly, that effort was followed by the less- than-stellar ""Prince Caspian"" . Luckily, ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" brings back the old Narnian magic in this installment!For a basic plot summary, ""Voyage"" sees the younger Pevensie siblings, Edmund (Skander Keynes) & Lucy (Georgie Henley), as well as their cousin Eustace (Will Poulter), once again drawn back into Narnia in order to help Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) defeat the last remaining threat to Narnian peace by sailing towards Aslan Country in search of lost citizens.The action/adventure is breathtaking and is a great change-of-pace from the slogging ""Caspian"". The visuals are stunning and should be viewed in HD if at all possible. Plus, the general storyline is taken from what is considered to be one of the better Narnia novels, so it is filled with imaginative twists/turns/characters that will keep you in awe. Basically, this film really brought Narnia ""alive"" for me again.All of that being said, ""Dawn Treader"" is still a child's movie through and through. It isn't real ""deep"" (just like its novel counterpart), but that allows it to appeal to a very wide audience.Thus, watch this one with the kiddies or just watch it alone with nostalgia...it really doesn't matter!

30,filipemanuelneto,"Is there any writer, in this film, which like to read?",3,12 April 2016,"This movie is the adaptation of a C.S. Lewis book. In this film, Lucy and Edmund Pevensie return to Narnia, for the last time, accompanied by an inconvenient and annoying cousin named Eustace, to assist Caspian to find seven lords of Telmar who disappeared at sea.Directed by Michael Apted, it has screenplay by Michael Petroni, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. The cast was headed by Georgie Henley (Lucy), Skandar Keynes (Edmund), Ben Barnes (Caspian), Will Poulter (Eustace) and also features the voices of Eddie Izzard (Reepicheep) and Liam Neeson (Aslan).""Chronicles of Narnia"" is a trilogy that started badly and ended worse. If the first two films were bad due to the inability to properly explore the original books and the incompetence of the director and writing team, they knew at least compensate it: the quality of the actors and their performances, the costumes and extraordinary scenery or the bright and colorful picture were aspects that granted a certain beauty for these movies that managed to forget the mistakes and made them into something good. Well, if they were not completely good, at least they were acceptable or reasonable. This film does not. This film ran over C. S. Lewis with the force of a train and just rewrote the story. I was not there to see it, but I bet that was Michael Petroni's fault because, back in 2002, he had done much the same thing in ""Queen of the Damned"", which I consider the worst vampire movie ever, even worse than the Hammer's B movies of the seventies. So, I believe Petroni loves to destroy books in the movies... but, if Petroni is relapsing into this crime, the remaining writers are, at least, accomplices in ""literary murder"", as the director, who would have certainly done better if he had made another movie with monkeys! In addition to the rewriting of the history, this film has other flaws: the special effects are unconvincing and the climax of the film is an unusual fight against an evil island, which makes no sense because the film does not explain anything or put things in context.This film, however, we need to recognize the quality of the sceneries and wardrobe, and above all the excellent performances of the actors. Ben Barnes, in particular, greatly improved his Caspian, now without that weird accent and a greater psychological depth.

33,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Narnia"" continues to lose some magic on a lesser budget",5,2 July 2011,"""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,"" the third book in ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" series and the fifth chronologically speaking, is often cited as a favorite among fans of the C.S. Lewis fantasy books, which is a shame because the writers here have taken extensive liberties with the story. Although I'm one to frequently remind people that films are films and books are books, ""Dawn Treader"" the movie is mediocre no matter how you look at it or which order you visit the story's islands in.It's apparent now why Disney dumped the ""Narnia"" franchise after ""Prince Caspian"" yielded disappointing results compared to ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe."" Fox tried to give it new life on a smaller budget, but sadly the lesser funds make it come off truly second rate. Better to not make any more films if you can't increase the wonder or impressiveness in the next installment. The green mist (that was made up by the writing team in the first place) serves as a terrific example of doing television-level special effects in a big-screen feature film.Set on the high seas, you might consider ""The Dawn Treader"" the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" of the ""Narnia"" series (and the film even ""borrows"" some musical themes from the Disney franchise's iconic score), so the potential for greater wonder exists, but with a budget $70 million less than ""Prince Caspian,"" that makes it tough. The imaginings of some of the book's most iconic moments lack a true artistic touch or inspiration.In this adventure, only Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) return from the first two films, which would be factually correct — that's not an example of the budget cuts. They're joined by their cousin Eustace, one of the most obnoxious children in literary history played brilliant (although much to our chagrin) by Will Poulter. When a picture in Eustace's house starts to leak water (one example of good special effects in the film), the three find themselves in the seas of Narnia where Caspian (Ben Barnes), now king, picks them up in his finest ship, the Dawn Treader. Although all seems well in Narnia, the kids join him on his quest to find the seven lost Lords of Telmar, which Caspian feels will give him some closure regarding his father.In ""The Odyssey"" fashion, the story takes the crew from island to island where they encounter an green mist, a growing evil force of darkness that looks to exploit fear and corrupt (think Darkseid in ""Superman"" or Galactacus in ""Green Lanter""). Each main character has a flaw (some bigger than others) that will be exploited on the journey.Dragons and a battle with a sea serpent make up the main draws for visual effects and excitement. The battles are far from epic, but a PG rating will do that to you, especially on a smaller budget. The most that ""Dawn Treader"" has going for it is this un-hatable positive spirit powered by that child-like sense of wonder. Primarily through characters such as Reepicheep (voiced by Simon Pegg), the film retains its charm and it keeps it afloat long enough. Lewis had an undeniable gift for the magic of fantasy and director Michael Apted helps keep that alive in some respects.Like Narnia no longer needed the services of Peter and Susan as will be the case with Lucy and Edmund, the audience these films needed to keep going strong has simply outgrown it or faded away with disinterest thanks to a focus on family-geared entertainment. I suspect the ""Narnia"" films (if they are able to make all seven), will always make an entertaining stop by, but without a slightly drastic change in vision, there's no reason to expect a return to grandeur.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
34,freemantle_uk,Narnia meets Pirates of the Caribbean,8,11 December 2010,"There were reasons to be both excited and nervous about this third instalment of the ""Narnia"" series, but luckily Michael Apted has made a fun, swashbucking family film.Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) are stuck in Cambridge, England, living with their bratty and selfish cousin Eustace Scrubb (Will Poulter). Edmund and Lucy long to return to Narnia; Peter has been rejected by the army for his age and Lucy, like many teenage girls, starts to have doubts about her looks. Through a magic painting the three youngsters are teleported to the oceans of Narnia and found by King Caspian X (Ben Barnes), leading a voyage to the Lone Islands. After freeing the people from a slave trader, Caspian, Lucy, Edmund and co. have to go eastward to find the seven lost lords and stop a mysterious green mist.Everything you would want or expect from a fantasy is here: sword fights, dragons, magic, legends, strange creatures, wizards and a quest into an unknown territory. The adventure was light-hearted and there is a great amount of humour. Poulter was excellent as the butt of the jokes as a spoiled child who is overwhelmed by his surroundings. He had a particularly good acting relationship with Keynes and Simon Pegg, the voice of Reepicheep. Pegg was able to inject some really comic energy as Eddie Izzard did with the role.The action was well handled and the special effects were decent. Because of the smaller forces involved and the sea-faring adventure there are no massive battles between large armies but more smaller, quicker skirmishes. The final battle was very much like the final action scene in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, a small group of people fighting a sea creature. The costumes were very similar to the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films and the filmmakers seem to be influenced by the ""Harry Potter"" series and the glowing sword from Lord of the Rings.Apted paces the film quickly with no moments of boredom to settle in. The voyage to a number of strangle desert-like islands was very similar to classic adventure films like Jason and the Argonauts. The dry islands were very similar to the Greek islands. It has an old-fashioned style and feel, but that is not necessarily bad -- in fact it's pretty good. The cinematography and set designs are bright and colourful and this is a perfect film to take children to.Whilst Keynes and Henley are a little unsteady at first in the film, they grow into their roles and becoming more assured. Barnes drops the Spanish accent from Prince Caspian and it helps him improve his performance. He was much more comfortable in the role and Caspian has grown up as character. He was more believable as a king then as a young prince.A problem with ""Voyage"" is there is a lack of a compelling antagonist. This film is more about the ""quest"" than The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian and there is a fresh amount of mystery, but the mystery has a lacklustre conclusion.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
35,XweAponX,"To find all you seek, There is Utter East",5,20 April 2011,"Voyage of the Dawn Treader has always been my favourite of the Narnia books. And as such, I am very familiar with it.Now I don't remember any side plot in the book regarding a green mist and seven swords. I am very disappointed that the screenwriter contrived this garbage and made it a MAJOR plot element.In the book, the main plot element is the voyage itself, the goal, the end of the world and a view of Aslan's Country. But in this version, we have an added Green Mist Threat and vanishing Narnians. This was NOT in the book and it is basically a travesty to add in a ""big bad evil"" where there was none. And the quest for non-existing magical swords, took away from the actual plot elements that CS Lewis had written.The original book stands by itself without such nonsense.Now my favourite part of the book is Eustace Clarence Scrubb's transformation into a dragon, and they got a lot of that episode wrong as well, in the book, part of Eustace' Misery is that Lord Octavian's Armband is stuck on his arm while a Dragon, it cannot come off and it hurts. This was changed in this film. Also, Alsan ripped the dragon directly from his skin, not the sand.Most of the elements of the Dawn Treader's voyage are here, in this film, albeit changed greatly to accommodate the irrelevant green mist nonplot.The Green Mist addition, would give this film an instant Zero rating, but they did get a lot of the imagery correct. Hence the ""5"" I gave this version. Also, at the end titles, we get to see Pauline Bayne's fantastic original art which was made for the hardbound copies of the book. I myself used to look at those pictures when I was a child. The use of the pictures in the end credits, makes this the best end titles of any Narnia film so far.Finally, the green mist non-lewis addition destroyed the most ominous aspects aspect of the final island visited by the Dawn Treader before reaching Ramandu's Island: The Isle where DREAMS come true. Dreams, not DAYdreams. The effectiveness of CS Lewis's book was totally obliterated by changing the nature of this island to ""The Island where Green Mist pours out of"".This change totally ruined the experience of this film for me, also, when entering Narnia in this episode, they are sucked into the frame of the painting, and I was so looking forward to see how they did that, but alas, they did not do it the way CS Lewis wrote it.This is the problem with these Narnia Moovies, CS Lewis created the script with ALL necessary plot elements, nothing need be added or changed, how dare these people re-write Lewis? I forgave Peter Jackson because Lord of the Rings could not have been filmed without the things he left out or added, and he never fundamentally changed any plot elements. But THIS last of the films based on Chronicles or Narnia, has been ruined incredibly by people thinking they can rewrite the great CS Lewis.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
36,estebangonzalez10,"Lacks Character development, but makes up for it with the visuals",6,13 December 2010,"¨You have returned for a reason. Your adventure begins now. ¨ The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is the third installment of The Chronicles of Narnia series which is based on C.S. Lewis's best selling children adventure books. Due to the fact that the second film, Prince Caspian, didn't do as well in the box office there was a change in the direction and production of the movie, but the cast is still the same. Michael Apted (The World is not Enough, Gorillas in the Mist) directed this sequel which stays pretty faithful to the book and is similar to the previous Narnia movies. The first movie is by far the most popular of the franchise (The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe) so it comes as no surprise that this third part isn't as good nor fun as that one. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader still is an entertaining movie, but it has lost some of the magic along the way. Fans of the series probably won't be disappointed by this movie, but those who haven't seen (or enjoyed for that matter) the other two films will probably not enjoy this movie as much since it follows a similar formula. The movie relies heavily on the special effects and for that reason the characters haven't been developed as well as they are in the books. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a fun and entertaining movie, but I enjoyed the book a lot more.The movie takes place one year after the adventure that the four Pevensie children had with Prince Caspian. Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) are staying with their aunt and annoying cousin, Eustace (Will Poulter from Son of Rambow fame), while England is still at War. Peter and Susan are in America and they have short cameos since they have already been told that they won't be able to return to Narnia. Lucy and Edmond begin to argue with Eustace over a painting of a Narnian ship sailing in an open ocean when all of a sudden water begins to come out of the paining and flood the room. The next thing they know they are swimming in the ocean and being rescued by Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) and his fleet in Narnia. Together the three kids, Caspian who is now the King, Reepicheep (the brave mouse voiced by Simon Pegg), and the rest of the crew have to search several islands for the seven lost lords of Narnia. The adventure begins aboard the Dawn Treader.Liam Neeson is back again as the voice of Aslan, the lion and creator of Narnia. Aslan represents Jesus Christ in this sort of parallel universe that C.S. Lewis created since he was a known Christian theologian. Several things throughout the movie have a biblical significance and serve as Christian parables. The movie also mixes several Roman and Greek mythological creatures from the book as well which add a little more magic to Narnia. The main characters of the film however are Lucy and Edmund, but I think that Henley's performance as Lucy is what has carried these movies so far. She is very likable on screen and is the best character. Poulter gave a good performance as Eustace and will have to carry the series from now on if they decide to go on with the fourth film (The Silver Chair) since Lucy and Edmund aren't allowed to return to Narnia. I remember reading all seven books of The Chronicles of Narnia, and my favorite one was The Horse and His Boy although it has nothing to do with these characters so I'm not sure if the producers are thinking of continuing with the franchise. I really enjoyed the books so I was a little disappointed with these movies as I was hoping they would have a production like the Harry Potter films had. It is still a fun and entertaining ride nevertheless, but not as good as the first film. What it lacks in character development, it makes up for in special effects.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
37,Fluke_Skywalker,Dawn Treader springs a leak,5,8 August 2015,"Nearly 40 minutes shorter than the previous two films, but feeling much longer, 'Dawn Treader' lacks anything resembling a story, compelling drama or interesting and relatable characters. There's no villain, save for ""the villain within"", but that aspect is handled so poorly that it often feels like watching someone play a video game using an invincibility cheat code. Speaking of video games, the special f/x look cheap and obvious, and the once lush production values also take a nosedive. The action is also dull and poorly shot/staged, with director Michael Apted (taking over for Andrew Adamson as the franchise moved from Disney to 20th Century Fox) clearly seeming out of his element and over his head.On the positive side, I guess, is that a very young Will Poulter makes for an extremely annoying Eustace, which I guess is the whole point. His character journey is handled quite poorly, especially compared to Edmund's in the first film, but it's the only one we get, so... And though your mileage may vary depending on your beliefs, 'Dawn Treader' doesn't skirt the allegorical aspects nearly as much as certainly 'Prince Caspian' did. Particularly at the end.There's really very little, if anything, to recommend here. It's dull and poorly made, connecting up with the previous two films like a Lincoln Log to a Lego.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
38,r96sk,I just couldn't find enough entertainment in it,6,4 November 2020,"I wouldn't class this as a good or bad film, it's in a weird sorta in-between to me.'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader' is, comparatively, bad. It loses the vibe and all the intrigue that the first film has, as it continues the downward trajectory set by the other sequel. However, it's still just about got a decent adventure feel to it.Only two of the youngsters reprise their roles 'properly', those being Georgie Henley (Lucy) and Skandar Keynes (Edmund). I'd always prefer a cast to remain the same, but if I'm honest this doesn't miss William Moseley (Peter) and Anna Popplewell (Susan) all that much. That argument is helped by the arrival of a young Will Poulter as Eustace. He's great.Plot-wise is where it gets meh. I didn't care for it, even if I did like its swashbuckling nature. I can see many finding enjoyment with it, but for me it doesn't quite come out positively unfortunately - it's sluggish. The ship set also feels rather cheap.Not at all a bad film; one that was interestingly made without the involvement of Disney, Walden Media joined up with Fox instead.

Add to that the now overpowering God bothering messages from Aslan, and it gets too sickly. Some of the action and effects are tremendous, including everything with the dragon and the sea beast, but it's such a bitty product, set mostly at sea, that the magic is gone.

Fortunately, Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes), sailing on the Dawn Treader, is nearby to save them, thus bringing them with him to another quest to save Narnia...Surprisingly crudely done for its enormous budget and spectacular visuals, the third instalment of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" feels more like a poorly construed television series, than a blockbuster extravaganza. The plot itself, obscenely bad for something based on a classic children series, rushes around in crazed erratic chaos, not helped by Ben Barnes irritating the hell of our sensitive ears. When a ship full of seasoned warriors somehow conclude that a launch party should consist of a girl, a teenager on the verge of puberty, a screaming first timer and their Prince-ruler, than you know something is seriously off. With too much story and occurrences populating the runtime not enough narrative meat to given to construe a flowing story, instead we feel like thrown on a mindless journey across the maddened Narnia waters.

42,moviexclusive,A voyage I'll be honoured to be on board,6,13 December 2010,"A much hoped for fantasy series was bestowed upon ever since the potter craze took us by surprise nine years ago. Now barely 5 years into its introduction and having the third instalment emerging into our theaters, have we chance upon another Dark Material or Percy Jackson flop? As i sat awaiting for the curtains to raise, a friend came by and nodded a presence and asked if this screening was a free-seating event. I mentioned no it wasn't and realised i had sat on the wrong seat. Now that's not a good start at all. Fortunately, fate took a turn and stepped up a notch in the interesting scale. It's pretty much in the same partake of that other popular fantasy series - that is not to be named - in terms of popularity and beefy content, they really take their own sweet time to flesh out the collection. This latest instalment of C.S. Lewis' beloved world, dives into the strange adventure among the crew of the Narnian ship, the Dawn Treader. Called upon were Edmund and Lucy, and the ever annoying cousin Eustace, who has a rather unfortunate name as he was useless (see what i did there? eh?) throughout the whole show until he finally redeemed himself near the end. Then came the loss. The older children are there no more. They've all grown up and has moved along and passed the adventure torch to others in need. Narnia is is need of dire saving from the curse emanating from the ""Dark Isle"". Along with Prince Caspien and Reepicheep (voiced by Simon Pegg) they rip through boundless creatures and characters, even threading along their own mortal enemy, themselves. Sounds familiar doesn't it? OK, here comes the beef. I was particularly weary of the 3D push by film makers now jumping into the band-wagon. Dawn Treader unfortunately has fallen into the hands of badly made 3D. Dark motion-blurred and unimpressive, even the trailers before hand was in a much better 3D state. Why doesn't anybody listen to advice (stop making inappropriate 3D films!) is baffling. Avoid at all cost. Then comes the poster, which is misleading (for those who hasn't read the book). Most are merely cameos and was rather disappointed that Aslan only had a will-appear-if- need clause. I miss that deep voice of Liam Neeson. He can make any silly conversation sound profound and serious. Another aspect of the downfall was how this chapter felt cheapened and less impressive which was apparent due to the cut in budget by the loss of finance from Walt Disney Company. Apparently after the not-so-good box office of Prince Caspien, a cut was eminent but Fox came galloping along as the saviour which meant a sacrifice in some aspect. That meant, less impressive CGI effects (noticed how thinner Aslan is?) and relied more to practical imagery which at some point turned out pretty magical, much like how they whipped up the scene of them coming back home into the house. That was pure child-like magic mastery. Michael Apted, unknown to many, brought us much of the 80s and 90's masterpiece such as Gorilla in the Mist, Nell and 007: The World Is Not Enough. Such experience craftsman surely has the power to restore the magic it suppose to possess. All was not lost as shown, having not read a single page of the book and basing the epic-ness of the series through the movies, Dawn Treader felt more complete. The journey felt more depth and it had further exploration of emotions as the kids are grown up. Unfortunately, they didn't explore more of that side of the story. The third in the series, well, in publication order that is but in chronological order this is the 3rd last in the journey. Yes, if this series goes well, i foresee two more sequels and maybe a prequel. And not too soon either that this series may be saved with the introduction of Eustace, who stole some or dare i say even most of the lime light as the annoying brat who will be the next torch bearer in the instalments to come and save Narnia. Again. Spoiler much? Played by Will Poulter, known to some in a well known independent film, Son of Rambow, played the character right on the spot and did a very convincing transformation in the end. Rather unfortunate that the rest of the cast seem to be losing their drive to go further developing their character but i guess they knew their time was up and had raised the white flag even before the director has yelled, ""It's a wrap!""",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

Azlan was hardly there that was Disappointing!,5,24 January 2011,"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader ( B- ) The Chronicles of Narnia has become more lackluster ever since the first Installment. Where Prince Caspian was great in production & less in Adventure, the 3rd installment ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" is full of Adventures but lacks good production value & enrich script. The 2nd ""Prince Caspian"" & 3rd ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" somehow didn't match up to the magic & phenomena of the 1st ""The Lion, Wardrobe and the Witch ""movie. This time the studio did try to put as much adventure they could because within the first five minutes Non-Stop adventures starts, which kept me engaging but as there was not much substance to the story so sometimes I wondered ""what exactly is happening?.

Georgie Henley is adorable and all grown up. It's good to see her innocent charming personality with lil grey shades. Skander Keynes is good as always.

Lewis adaptations sees Edmund and Lucy, along with their irritable cousin Eustace travel back to the magical world of Narnia where 7 Lords have been kidnapped. Along with Prince Caspian the group must find the Lords and their swords whilst overcoming their own personal issues.There are many ways to describe a terrible film. But to be honest this is more of a disappointment.I say that as I enjoyed the first film where the second dwindled but this maybe down purely to the story.Edmund and Lucy are moaning about not being in Narnia then two seconds later they are in it. The story ferries the pair and their cousin around for a bit, taking them to the most pointless places possible.The first stop is just for stunt showmanship and a very boring array of dialogue explains how they must find all 7 swords. There was something to do with green mist to that never had a very lasting effect in entertainment. There are predictable character dimensions in manly rivalry, a young girl's beauty doubts and a young boy who isn't used to being told no.After all the first Narnia had a swagger, a purpose and funny characters and the second release, Prince Caspian, had too far fetched ideas and focused itself on special effects rather than the story. The same is probably the same for this release.I saw at the cinema in 2D and am glad I didn't pay extra to see a mouse fling his sword out the screen at me. In a world of Avatars and of Star Wars it is hard to compete visually for that extra thrill of awe, especially in the science fiction or fantasy genre. This edition has a strong fantasy element and unfortunately everything feels tried and tested as ever. The big serpent in the sea at the end is a terrible version of a basilisk from Potter, the talking swashbuckling mouse is laughable and fantasy genre or not, the high motionless waves cannot be taken in whatever context.Running for almost 2 hours you will be left adrift by the whole pointlessness of the crew's adventures and how there is always an inevitable conclusion. Although there was a quote by Eustace to the mouse which had me in stitches, partially because it was sentimental and because it had been said in many romantic films.Given the price of 3D films, the mismatched computer effects and a barely humorous and illogical plot this is not worth the time for the family.In a time when Harry Potter has just been released and has wowed fans once more with its enchanting dark and visually graphic plot, there is only one choice.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
46,fernandoschiavi,"It is a film that escapes a bit of the magic and enchantment of Narnia. It is the most childish film, full of cliché phrases but still, it is a good trip to be in",6,24 January 2021,"Adapted by Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely and Michael Petroni, the script this time focuses only on the two youngest members of the Pevensie family, Edmund (Keynes) and Lucy (Henley), as Susana and Pedro, now adults, can no longer return to Narnia. Accompanied by the boring (no; unbearable) cousin Eustace (Poulter), they return to the world in which they are royalty in order to help Caspian in several missions awakened by the need to destroy a new Evil - and if I am not being very clear in describing the that precisely involves this journey, is because the film cannot do it either. Thus, we accompany the heroes in a kind of ocean movie that takes them to various points in Narnia while overcoming the obstacles that come their way, facing warriors, dragons, dwarves and newts.The apparently simple plot requires more than two hours of film to develop. The impression that remains is that everything happens in an accelerated way, without the time necessary for the relationships between the characters and the environments to be worked well. The construction of isolated conflicts, which seem to be independent chapters in time and space, with a fragile link to the main narrative, collaborates to create the impression that the adapted script was not efficient. The lack of structure in The Voyage of Dawn Treader, by the way, represents one of the main problems of the narrative: developing the story in an apparent improvisation, the script seems to lead the characters from one place to another without planning what will come next, creating new ones. objectives as the story unfolds and without worrying about creating an internal cohesion that justifies each stage. When Lucy is captured by invisible creatures that force her to invade an equally invisible fortress, for example, the nature of such beings and the reason behind the rivalry between them and the owner of the mansion are never clarified - and as soon as the Dufflepuds fulfill their function of taking the girl to find the book of spells and, consequently, of making the group pass the level, going to level 7, are promptly forgotten by the film. And this is not a problem exclusive to the film, since the structure of the book is very similar. With that, the impression is that Narnia 3 uses the fantastic scenarios and visual effects to disguise the fact that it does not have a good story to tell to the cinema. And do not have. This is one of the books in the series that would have to include new elements to enhance and enhance the journey.Despite the children's cast being well again (especially the great Georgie Henley), as well as all the supporting actors, the film skids elsewhere. In this film, we see the growth of the characters with their more outlined characteristics, such as Edmund's impulsiveness and concern for Lucy's beauty, typical of her age. Few facts were left out of the film, what happened was an inversion in the order of some events, but which are explained when we talk about an adaptation in images of a book, and some invented things, but that didn't work as well (especially the green fog). Many of the changes are explained by a simple fact: the pace and development of the narrative. A film needs an upward narrative construction and the change in events has sometimes aimed precisely at this in order to provide more excitement and a greater level of adventure on the journey across the seas of Narnia.Many criticize the children's script, but those who have not read the books do not know that the book is in fact very childish, even more than the others. The clear impression we have is that something is missing, both in the film and in the book, but the guilt of the film can indeed be reduced drastically, since the source from which the writers drank was not so abundant this time. Precisely because of the changes already mentioned and especially the small changes, and if we compare it with the other adaptations, this is the least faithful of the films when compared to the original work of CS Lewis, however, it is important that we highlight a fact: this is undoubtedly the less interesting book in the whole series, although it is also good. There are not so many relevant events and the adventures on each of the islands do not present an interesting story and, therefore, director Michael Apted managed to make a good movie ""getting milk out of stone"" when we talk about the content. The director and the technical team managed to do a good job and even maintain a good pace to the plot despite the lack of a great villain in fact, few action scenes, battles and the lack of more complex conflicts.However, explicit holes must be observed. What motivates the adventure? Who are the seven gentlemen and what do they do? What islands are those? These are just some of the questions poorly answered by the script by Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely and Michael Petroni. At some point even King Caspian (Ben Barnes) wonders about the paths they are taking. And when a character's statement can be used against the story in which he participates, it is a sign that something is very wrong. ""The Voyage of the Pilgrim of the Dawn"" is, above all, a feature film made for children, for those who are still surprised to see a large talking rat and a minotaur interacting with humans, or are frightened by a super water monster destroying ships and an evil fog. Bringing an irritating and, at the same time, flawed didacticism, the script bets on a Manichaean world to the extreme, where good people are protected with a destiny of happiness and those of evil have no hope.But it is always in the moral and ideological realm that The Chronicles of Narnia series stumbles, whether by bringing Santa Claus giving children with guns, by showing young heroes using violence in a ""justified"" way or, as it happens here, by associating the excuse of the very dislike Eustace about ""being pacifist"" to his cowardly character. In addition, when trying to create dramatic arcs for the characters, the film calls for cheap lessons: after spending a great deal of time demonstrating an immense desire to be beautiful like her older sister, Lucy goes through a brief experience of how the world would be. had not been born (and immediately resolves her internal conflict, starting to repeat what she learned to the little girl who seems to admire her unconditionally.That author CS Lewis conceived his series of books on the world of Narnia as a Christian allegory is something that has become clear to anyone who has not read the original works since the first adaptation directed by Andrew Adamson in 2005, The Lion, the Witch and o Wardrobe - and if any doubts still lingered in the minds of the viewers, this was dispelled for good in the next film, Prince Caspian. Thus, when in this film the lion Aslan explains to young people Edmund and Lucy that, in our world, he is known ""by another name"", the impression that remains is that the filmmakers are simply throwing open the obviousness in the public's head - and, in this sense, I would not be surprised if they had even considered the possibility of changing the title of the work to The Chronicles of Narnia: The Return of the Child Jesus. The insertion of messages well positioned between the details of the plot and the rejection of any attempt at religious didacticism are merits that need to be mentioned. Michael Apted's film approaches the theme in an intimate way and the scene in which these characteristics appear more explicitly.With the cooperation of efficient special effects, the director has isolated moments of quality that lead to the construction of scenes with good doses of magic, such as the passage of Edmund, Lucy and Eustace to Narnia or the sequence in which the same Lucy reads a spell that has the simple objective of making it snow. But it is also quite clear that in some sequences, the finalization of the art seems amateurish and uncomfortable when compared to the work of the previous films.With a final balance between mistakes and successes, the truth is that this new episode of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" ends with a positive balance. The setback of some characteristics is visible, but the improvement in key points for the evolution of the story is also there. It is the most childish film, full of cliché phrases and the effect of all films to date, but practically all the facts are there and very well represented by the art direction, costume designers and photography. It is a film that escapes a bit of the magic and enchantment of Narnia, but despite some problems it also demonstrates several merits and undoubtedly must be accompanied by everyone, especially by fans of the books. Some good lessons in life, friendship and love are there, as well as the good visual effects and the great soundtrack by David Arnold, who certainly raised the level of the film at various times.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
47,ja_kitty_71,The best Narnia film made,10,30 December 2010,"My mom and I went to see this new Narnia film in 3D and we love it. We thought it was the best Narnia film made.Where we left off from ""Prince Caspian,"" Peter and Susan are in America with their parents, while Lucy and Edmund are staying with their cousin Eustace Scrubb in Cambridge. And then, in the room Lucy is staying on the visit, the three youngsters unexpectedly got drawn into Narnia when a painting of a ship on the wall comes to life, and the three children find themselves in the ocean and rescued by the crew of the ship ""Dawn Treader."" Once safely on board, Lucy, Edmund and Eustace greeted by Caspian (now King Caspian) who has undertaken a quest to find the seven lost Lords of Narnia, as he had previously promised to Aslan. Of course, Lucy and Edmund glad they're back in Narnia, but Eustace was less than enthusiastic. Reepicheep is also on board, as he has vowed to find the seas of the ""utter East."" So, I love really this film from beginning to end, perfect to go with the other two ""Narnia"" films; and worth buying when it comes on DVD.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
48,ajs-10,Maybe not quite as good as the first two but still worth a look,7,24 December 2011,"Having seen all of the 'Narnia films so far I thought it would be a shame to miss the opportunity to see the third offering when it came up on TV recently. Although maybe not as strong as the previous two, I still enjoyed this one. I did suffer (I thought) from its certification though all of the fight scenes are toned down quite a bit. Having said that, it's still very well made with a pretty strong storyline to back it up. More of my thoughts after this brief summary.Having been drawn back to Narnia, Lucy and Edmund Pevensie are joined this time by their cousin Eustace Scrubb. He is peevish, annoying and altogether a bit obnoxious, to say the least! They land at sea and are dragged from it by Prince (now King) Caspian and the crew of the Dawn Treader. The ship is on a mission to find the seven noble men, allies of Caspian's father, who escaped to the Lost Isles. When they arrive, after a bit of a hiccup involving some slavers, they discover that six of them had set sail to find the source of an evil that has plagued the isles. Many citizens had been sacrificed to a mysterious fog that makes them disappear. The ship sets sail on an adventure that will test all of them to their limits. I really don't want to say any more or the Spoiler police will have me keel-hauled (again).Very well made with some excellent CGI, this film is great to look at and it really should have achieved more praise for that (IMO). As far as performances go, well I have to agree with the critics, the stand-out performance came from the young Will Poulter as Eustace Clarence Scrubb. He fully deserved the nominations and praise he's received for this performance. The others involved also did a good job, so honourable mentions must go to; Georgie Henley as Lucy Pevensie, Skandar Keynes as Edmund Pevensie, Ben Barnes as Caspian, Gary Sweet as Drinian and the voice talents of; Simon Pegg as Reepicheep and Liam Neeson as Aslan.Now, I have to admit that, of the Narnia stories, I have only ever read 'The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe' when I was young. This means that I can only judge each subsequent film adaptation on the film alone. I'm pleased to say that I quite enjoyed this one, with a few misgivings. The highlight being the relationship between the characters of Eustace and Reepicheep, that really stole the dhow (for me). Over all, although not quite as good as the first two, I did find it very entertaining and I'd deem it worth a look Recommended.My score: 7.2/10.IMDb Score: 6.4/10 (based on 29,950 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 49/100 (based on 155 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

49,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"While not a perfect film, Voyage of the Dawn Treader has enough visual beauty and heart with strong performances, great music, and solid set pieces",8,10 December 2020,"Back in 2005, Disney and Walden Media managed to adapt one of the most popular books of the Chronicles of Narnia known as The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, a story about the Pevensie children who discover the magical world from a wardrobe. However, when the White Witch plots to kill the four kids and rule Narnia, forever, the kids have to accept their destiny by defeating her and become Kings and Queens. Directed by Andrew Adamson and also starring William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie Henley along with James McAvoy, Tilda Swinton, and Liam Neeson, it became a huge success at the box office.Later on, the same cast and crew of the first film started production on the second film Prince Caspian with plans for a holiday release in 2007 only to be delayed to May 2008 due to Walden Media's other film The Water Horse taking it's place. The story involves the Pevensie children returning to Narnia after one year, but realized that 1,300 years have passed and the Telmarines led by Lord Miraz have conquered the entire world of Narnia. His nephew, Prince Caspian, escapes from his uncle after plotting to kill him. The Pevensie then has to aid Caspian to defeat the corrupted Miraz and save the world of Narnia once again. The film came out with mixed to positive results with the acting and visual effects being praised while the darker mature tone received polarizing reviews from fans. And while the film became a box office success, it didn't make enough money and Disney dropped out of the film franchise.Later on, 20th Century Fox took over for the franchise to distribute The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and started production. The film was gonna have a May 2009 release date, but due to Disney dropping out, they delayed it to December of 2010, hoping the film would do better in the holidays. The story involves Edmund and Lucy returning to Narnia along with their cousin Eustace Scrubb only to reunite with Prince Caspian on the Dawn Treader. This time, their new mission is to find all of the seven lords of Narnia who were banished by Lord Miraz. Little did they know that a new threat known as the Green Mist seeks to make the children and all of Narnia give in to temptation, so they have to find all seven lords along with all seven swords in order to save Narnia once again. The film came out to mixed results with praise to the acting and visual effects, but got criticized for it's pacing and screenplay.Now that it's been 10 years since this film's release, I thought this film was actually really good. Ok, it's not a perfect film and I do understand why some people didn't like it as much, but it's a third movie that actually really works and it's a marginal improvement over Prince Caspian, which I thought was also good but it wasn't immune to it's problems.It managed to stay true to the spirit of the book despite some changes (which I won't spoil to those who haven't seen the film or haven't even read the book) while giving Edmund and Lucy more to do and even Prince Caspian did improve over the last film. Reepicheep is also great and the new character Eustace Scrubb was both hilarious and compelling thanks to Will Poulter's superb performance. In fact, the acting is still good with Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes and Ben Barnes delivering solid performances along with Simon Pegg (who replaced Eddie Izzard from the last film) who provided some laughs and sincerity to the role of the CGI talking mouse.Aside from the pacing being quite uneven, the cinematography is great, the directing from Michael Apted (known for directing some of the James Bond sequels) is stunning, the music score from David Arnold is great and fitted the tone of the film, and the action sequences still hold up after 10 years.Overall, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a really good third entry. Given that this was the final Narnia film distributed by Walden Media and Netflix gaining the rights to adapt the entire book series, it was a fitting conclusion. Yes, it's not perfect and again I can see why some people didn't like this, but it's worth checking out. This receives a thumb's up.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
50,jdkraus,"Certainly not a disaster, but it's definitely not memorable like the first two films.",7,19 December 2010,"""The Dawn Treader"" was never a favorite of mine of the Chronicles of Narnia series, but it wasn't bad either. I did not know what to expect when stepping into the theater. The first two films by Andrew Adamson were very well done (even though Prince Caspian deviated very far from the book). Like with the C.S. Lewis book, the movie is good but not in comparison to the earlier installments.The movie has nearly everything going for it: lots of swashbuckling action, exotic locations, almost every fantasy creature imaginable, and a decent cast. Will Poulter was an excellent choice for Edmund and Lucy's cousin Eustace. He was an annoying, selfish, brat in the book— and he takes it to the extreme in the film. Towards the end though, the viewer comes to like him. The actors in the previous films seem to meld into their roles perfectly, especially Ben Barnes as Caspian, who seems to have dropped his thick Spanish accent from the first film. This certainly helps performance, allowing him to deliver his lines more fluently. The one cast change that was somewhat disappointing was Simon Pegg as the replacement voice for Reepicheep. He does a decent job, but his voice doesn't fit the character as well as Eddie Izzard in the earlier installment ""Prince Caspian."" The technical aspects somehow seemed to have been improved. The set designs and cinematography is bright and colorful, no doubt intended to draw children, and the CGI is flawless. The story, however, lacks. There's a big showdown with a sea serpent, yet it does not develop itself as a main antagonist. The White Witch once again is present, but all she does is taunt a certain character in his visions—she has no other purpose. The White Witch seems to be thrown in at the last moment. If she had come back from the dead as badass villain like in ""The Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe"", that would be a surprise—but no, there are no such twists.The movie also seemed to drag, which is unusual for a ""Chronicles of Narnia"" feature. It also did not feel the same. David Arnold replaced Harry Gregson—Williams as the composer, which was a bad idea. There's a certain magic he created in the first two films that was not present in this film. Michael Apted also replaced Andrew Adamson as director. He wasn't a bad choice, but Adamson's work from the first two films proved superior—at least in the fantasy genre. Also, the actors who play the two eldest children have mere cameos in the movie (as it was in the book). This is not necessarily bad, but without them in the film, it seems to be another hole. I've been so used to seeing the 4 siblings together that them not being together feels awkward. What would Abbot and Costello be without Costello? Just Abbot. That's exactly how it is in this film—there are things that lack. ""The Dawn Treader"" is certainly not a disaster, but it's definitely not memorable like the first two films. My rating: 3/4",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
51,Likes_Ninjas90,Children will probably relish the visual wizardry but their parents will be less engaged by film's familiarity,6,1 December 2010,"Time has passed since Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) last ventured into Narnia. They are still stuck in England, this time with their nasty cousin Eustace Scrubb (Will Poulter), while their siblings Peter (William Moseley) and Susan (Anna Popplewell) have left for America. Out of nowhere, Lucy, Edmund and Eustace are swept inside the painting of a ship and sent back to Narnia. They are rescued from the ocean by Caspian (Ben Barnes), who invites them onboard his sailing ship, the Dawn Treader. It's manned by pirates and talking animals, including a sword fighting rat named Reepicheep (voiced by Simon Pegg). Caspian describes how Narnia has been at peace for many years now but he insists on investigating the disappearance of the seven lords. After being attacked by slave traders and seeing some of their friends disappear amidst a smoky green spirit, Caspian, Edmund and Lucy must find the seven swords of the lords to break the curse of Dark Island. Taking over from Andrew Adamson, who worked on the first two Narnia films, is director Michael Apted who has made a more accessible but less sophisticated adventure film than his predecessor. The tone of the film is lighter in a visual and thematic sense. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, which was filmed on location in New Zealand and the Gold Coast, spends much of its time on beautiful open waters and coastal villages, saturated with bright sunlight and gold sandstone. The Dawn Treader itself is a magnificent vessel, shaped like the arching back of a sea serpent and powered by an enormous purple sail. The film maintains a warmer look and tone but it also lacks the first film's intensity, with its strikingly cold and isolated colour palette. It is still a supremely attractive film, but in no part due to the 3D technology either. Only a few scenes appear to have visibly added depth and there would be little missed in viewing the film without the glasses. Interestingly, it's also a much shorter film than the other entries, running under two hours and padded with endless panning aerial shots of the Dawn Treader. The most problematic omission from the film's narrative are the characters Peter and Susan. They only appear in a single fantasy sequence. The first Narnia film was strengthened by not only its religious symbolism but its allegory of family values in a wartime context. Though the screenplay here is credited to three writers, it's clear that there's a lot less of this and that any ideas relating to image and individuality run second to the action. Lucy has grown up significantly and is therefore more concerned about her looks, wanting to be more physically like Susan. Edmund also has brief exchanges with Caspian about who is really leading the ship. These transparent ideas are driven through uninspired dialogue. Lines such as ""to defeat the darkness out there, you must defeat the darkness inside yourself"" might be true to the novel but have matured poorly. Georgie Henley is at least the sweetest of the children, but there are a few fairly thankless side characters, like Gary Sweet with a pirate growl, who is given little to work with. When he is asked what's out in the dark, he snarls back: ""Pure evil"". The action, of which there is plenty, is at least dynamic and competently staged. The most elaborate sequence is a climactic battle involving a giant sea monster, looking to crush the ship. Children will probably relish the visual wizardry in sequences like this, but their parents will be less engaged by film's familiarity.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
52,sashank_kini-1,Ship is damaged yet floating,6,1 September 2011,"Watching the film, the one thing that lingers in my mind is the departure- the ending that is quite strong, even though I wasn't teary-eyed. The second thing that I could observe is that the film is analogous to HP 7 P-1, it devotes more of its time to a search and is comparatively sparse in its action sequences. I could in fact sense from the poster itself that this would be more mellow. The third thing that I saw was the magical disappearance of Ben Barnes' indistinguishable accent. I thank the actor/director for that, since he sounds more comfortable without having to alter his natural accent. The fourth thing different in the film is the absence of Peter and Susan from the world of Narnia. So its quite a strain for Georgie and Skandar as Lucy and Edmund respectively, who have more screen time and more complex roles. And the last striking feature in the film is Eustuce, homophonous to Useless, who later becomes quite useful in the film. And his role is impishly and satisfyingly played by Will Poulter. In fact, Will Poulter is probably one of the stronger features of the movie. The plot here, as I mentioned above, revolves around Lucy and Edmund Pevensie who at the time of the war, are grounded at their uncle's house. The beginning itself is an indication of Edmund's fearless spirit as he unsuccessfully tries to enroll himself for the war with a fake ID. Its quite funny when Lucy interrupts and spoils his little subterfuge. Then the scene cuts to a very acerbic boy who scornfully maligns Lucy and Edmund in his thin diary, and this guy is their cousin Eustuce. Eustuce seems like a miniature version of Sue Sylvester from Glee. The three of them are in Lucy and Edmund's room when Lucy observes that the painting in the bedroom is moving. The philistine Eustuce meanwhile rambles about the futility of fairy tales. It is then that the worlds converge momentarily. Narnia beckons them, this time flooding their room, and the three of them plunge into the ocean depths, almost drowning because of Eustuce's mistake. They are saved by Prince Caspian and his crew and are taken on board. This results in one of the most memorable scenes in the movie, when Eustuce realizes that he's not in 'England' anymore.Caspian explains to Lucy and Edmund about the seven Lost Lords of Narnia and their omnipotent swords to prevent evil forces from corroding the lands. So one can realize how close this is to Deathly Hallows, or rather how Deathly Hallows is close to this. Their search takes them to many arcane islands, with adventures ranging from slave trade escape to mysterious invisible beings and land of gold. The slave trade auction reminded me of the scene from Groundhog Day which I watched recently, but well done nevertheless because of Eustuce's self-importance. Although there is an unnecessary line when Eustuce knocks off an enemy unknowingly. He says something like ""Oh I hope it wasn't from the British Council"" which is plain bad and clichéd writing meant for movies like Fast and Furious and Transormers. Another downer was that the fight was dreadfully short, with the Dawn Treader crew defeating the baddies in no time. But I did get to know about the green mist which is more important to the story since it smells ones fears and devours the person who succumbs to them. The guys head to the other places, and there is some quirky writing and some bad writing. The invisible creatures are amusing, if a bit childish. Lucy enters the mansion and finds a spell book and is attracted by one page regarding perfect beauty. Lucy's insecurity and inferiority complex is evident as she years to be like Susan. This brings back Susan momentarily, though her scene is rushed and over in seconds, which I found a bit unsatisfactory considering that Lucy was infatuated with her sister's beauty. Then there's the land of gold where again there is a poorly shot sequence between Ben Barnes and Skandar Keynes, perfunctorily written and carelessly acted. Such shabbiness I didn't find in the Harry Potter films even though there are unnecessary and constant bickering and fights in the Harry Potter books.Eustuce's transformation and his newly developed kinship with Reepicheep were good moments though Eustuce's character in the entirety of the film seemed quite underdeveloped and underutilized. And this is mainly because of the shortness of the film in comparison with its predecessors, which are about 30-35 minutes longer than it. So when the time comes and everyone braces themselves for the showdown, its a bit underwhelming, considering that their journey was far less endangering and daunting than expected. The sea creature looks like the basilisk from HP Part 2 but is a lot less frightening. The battle itself seems a wee bit tame. The characters of Gail and Lillindil are wasted and Tilda's role becomes repetitive. Ben Barnes is quite calm and smooth in his approach this time, making him more likable. One can say that he underplays his role. Also, 'FEAR' is very poorly covered in the movie. 'FEAR' of losing power, fear of not being beautiful, fear of disappointing one's father are things that should vitally affect the person psychologically. I'd say Harry Potter did a marvelous job in creating the tense atmosphere to manifest fear. In The Dawn Treader however, fear is feebly shown, with none of the actors exhibiting the true effect of fear, especially Skandar who seems blank in his response. Eustuce is right about one thing- the ship does look ridiculous with its dreadful purple sail and green dragon front. As for the film, it lacks the personality of the first (displayed by Swinton) and the intensity of the second. It's a good job that keeps the series afloat.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
53,griffolyon12,A Scaled Down Epic,7,14 December 2010,"The new Chronicles of Narnia adventure, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, trades the epic exterior of its two predecessors for an insular seafaring yarn that is always entertaining, but lacking in sheer fantastical scope.The Chronicles of Narnia-The Voyage of the Dawn Treader follows the youngest of the Pevensie siblings, Edmund and Lucy, as they are whisked back to Narnia alongside their annoying cousin Eustace, who would rather not believe that such a fantastical place exists. The Pevensies team up once again with former Prince, now King, Caspian to sail across the Narnia Seas to return the Seven Swords of these Narnian Lords to Aslan's Table far beyond the edges of Narnia's map, and the adventure ensues to stop this evil mist from bringing darkness to all of Narnia.While Dawn Treader is never light on laughs, action, or heart, the movie never takes enough of a break from the action to expand the world in which the story takes place in. Director Michael Apted shoots everything as if it was a gritty, real world drama, forsaking the lyrical look and feel of the first two installments. We are never given the chance to see the sheer grandeur of this fantastical world that is Narnia, a world that should feel more lively than our own, but alas the real world sequences have more of a genuine scope than those in Narnia. Regardless, Apted manages to make Dawn Treader a more insular experience than its previous installments.There is more character exploration in this Narnia adventure than in either of the first two. The stories chronicling Lucy's development into accepting herself as who she is, and not being jealous of her older sister's beauty, alongside the arc of Eustace (played hilariously by Will Poulter) being greedy, transforming into a dragon, and then learning how to not be a brat while flying around spouting fire, are the two finest aspects of this movie. While the mysterious mist overtaking the Seas of Narnia is not as threatening a villain as a human opponent may have been, C.S. Lewis utilized the mist in the book as an allegory to the sin and temptations of man, and it is in these scenes of temptation where the mist is a menacing antagonist to our heroes. Whether it's Caspian's doubts in his leadership, Edmund's desire to be strong and powerful, or Lucy's yearning to be beautiful and desirable to the opposite sex, Michael Apted serves the characters well.While Dawn Treader has some moments where it stumbles, it has more than enough moments that make it a worthwhile voyage. Reepicheep the mouse is still a comedic highlight to this series of films, and Aslan's presence always warms the heart whenever he appears. What really makes this a movie worth watching, is the way that the philosophical ideas and spiritual allegories presented are woven into the adventure, making it impossible to not be moved in some way.I give The Chronicles of Narnia-The Voyage of the Dawn Treader a 7 out of 10!",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
54,dilipbts,The chronicles of Narnia the voyage of the dawn treader,8,10 June 2020,"I have watched this film in 3d at a preview screening in London.First of all, I do not recommend anyone watching this in 3d. It is too dark and the action is just a motion blur. It's dreadful.As for the film, there is much to enjoy with excellent visual effects, action set pieces (though ruined for me by the 3D) and a couple of stand out characters. But unfortunately there is also much to cringe at in some bouts of terrible dialogue.The characters of Reepicheep (the kick-ass warrior mouse) and Eustace, (the obnoxious brat cousin) were the most fun with the actor playing Eustace demonstrating excellent comic timing. The relationship between them was funny and touching. And they even brought much needed zest to the action.But alarmingly, Edmund and Lucy seem to have deteriorated as actors. Some of their emotions are too forced which is a pity. Not sure why, as I would expect them to improve with each film as did the young cast of the Harry Potter movies.Overall, the story has surprisingly been well adapted considering not a great deal actually happens in the book. But the pacing is good, even though a little episodic. There are much more Christian analogies once again which would please many and irritate others. But I rather like all of the analogies.I do feel however, that amongst adults, mostly those who enjoyed the Narnia books will enjoy this more than non readers of the books because the story is too bizarre even for a fantasy! But I think most children will enjoy this immensely, regardless if they read the books or not.With better written dialogue and better handling of the child performances (namely Lucy and Edmund), this could have been a much better film but as its stands its an enjoyable enough entry in this series.Oh and I will say it again, do not watch this in 3d.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

I haven't read the books, and maybe the tale this movie is build upon isn't as good as the two others, but I still think it's a great adventure movie and all kids will definitely love to watch it.But for all the grownups or teenagers that have been following the movies until now, there isn't that much adventure in this movie, maybe we will be looking more forward to the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean movie for a good adventures flick at sea.It does have it's moments, and it's still tells an interesting tale, it's just more for the younger crowd then the ones above 20 I think.

56,dfle3,"A little too successful at first, but improves...",7,8 December 2010,"Edmund and Lucy Pevensie return for what looks like possibly the final chapter in this franchise. Do remember reading somewhere that there were many books on which this movie series was based on, hence a lot more movies to come. Watching the ending of this movie, it seemed to be signalling that the story was all tied up...so, not sure how readers of the novels would take that and whether they think the movies have thus done the books justice.In any case, the movie opens with Edmund trying to bluff his way into the English army, to fight on the front in World War II (Edmund is too young to legally enlist in the army). A new character is introduced...the child cousin of Edmund and Lucy...Eustace Scrubb. He's the main reason I say that the movie is a little too successful at first. Eustace strikes me as a stock character...he's meant to be annoying, but he is too successful in bringing out that reaction...he's just not much fun to be around (for the characters in the movie and the viewing audience too...at least in my case). Perhaps such stock characters were appreciated more decades ago, but nowadays they just seem ill-fitting with modern sensibilities. However, on reflection, I do see Eustace's journey as a parallel one to that of the viewer...early on in the movie the Narnia story seemed just so much a child's wish fulfilment fantasy...it was impossible to lose oneself in that world in the way I lost myself in the magical first movie in the series. But eventually, like Eustace, you become more immersed in the world and appreciate it. It's this transition in tone of movie which bumps up my score to 7/10...if I had been annoyed by Eustace's scepticism for the entire movie, it would have done well to score 6/10.""The voyage of the Dawn Treader"" sees the Pevensie children mysteriously summoned back to Narnia...with a reluctant companion...Eustace. On the good ship Dawn Treader, captained by Prince Caspian (from the second movie in the series), the Pevensie children/monarchs in Narnia sail close to unchartered waters and islands. They land on a terrified island where the inhabitants are either sold into slavery or sacrificed to a mysterious green fog in the ocean which makes them disappear without a trace.Our heroes seek to find the source of this evil green fog and to conquer it. Their quest seems rather akin to a video game quest...find certain objects which are scattered around Narnia and place them in a certain location.This movie shares the same sense of child's fantasy play of its immediate predecessor, without the captivating magic of the original movie. It would be a pity if it was a rushed attempt to tie up loose ends from the novels because of any financial difficulties of the studio funding it. Not having read the books, I can't comment on this.By the by, I have seen posters for the movie with Eustace being the central figure. If I'd know how annoying he would be initially, I would have counselled against his use in those posters!A nice enough movie, eventually, but it's a pity the sequels weren't as captivating as the original.I've reviewed the first two movies in this series at this site.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
57,dvc5159,Something was missing,5,10 December 2010,"""The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader"" is the third film in the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" saga. While I enjoyed the visual spectacles I truly can't help but feel that something was missing when they made the movie.It wasn't the actors - the youngest two of the four actors playing the main ""Pevensie"" children are back; Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes, who have grown-up and (not-so) quite improved in maturity and depth. Also returning to the cast is Ben Barnes as King Caspian, with his only (and the most jarring) flaw being that his Spanish accent in the previous film has been replaced with a British one. Newcomers are here as well - ""Son of Rambow""'s Will Poulter is the funniest character in the film, playing the Pevensies' cousin Eustace Scrubb who is full of sarcasm and wit - and who also will return for the next installment replacing the Pevensies, if any. The voice actors also do their part well, with Liam Neeson, wise as ever as the voice of Aslan, and especially Simon Pegg as Reepicheep (replacing Eddie Izzard from the previous one), giving his character a wiser and more noble personality.While the story looks like a cookie-cutter fare, there's more to it than one will normally think; there are some elements which adults may come to appreciate more than children, especially at the end. The screenplay, however, spoils some of these moments with a few atrocious lines. Perhaps this was one of the major flaws, if the screenwriter had been more hardworking, this would've been better.The special effects are good but not that noticeable in 3D. I particularly enjoyed the last action sequence a lot due to its extensive but well use of CGI. David Arnold's score is more glorious than Harry-Gregson Williams' score from the previous two films. Production design and cinematography are nothing short of grand. Replacing Andrew Adamson in the director's chair is James Bond 007 (""The World Is Not Enough"") director Michael Apted, whose mature direction is what saves this film from being a mere kids sequel.However, I just felt that there's something missing. Maybe it's the spark from the previous two movies. There wasn't just an ""oomph"" to it anymore, it's just watching and being entertained, and not being wowed. But that's just me. Overall this is a more-than-decent picture to watch in the holidays, perfect for families, and if this breaks the bank, we'll have another four more movies to finish.Overall rating: 58/100",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
58,Ryan_MYeah,"As always, it's stylishly produced, but most of the magic of the first two films seems to have been lost.",5,15 December 2010,"Today, I checked out the latest entry of the Chronicles of Narnia film franchise based on the books by C.S. Lewis, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.In this film, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie are currently taking shelter in a home owned by their uncle. But, through the magic of a mysterious painting, they're suddenly brought back into Narnia, and brought aboard the Dawn Treader, the strongest ship of the Narnia armada, but they also bring along their cousin, Eustace. With the help of Caspian, they seek seven legendary swords that can destroy a mysterious new enemy, a deadly green mist.The film makes good use of its cast, and their performances are fine, and do their best to carry the film. Just like the first two films, Dawn Treader is handsomely produced, boasting impressive production design, costumes, makeup, sound design, and special effects, and some great battle sequences, such as a daring escape from slave traders, and a nail biting final battle with ferocious sea serpents.But you know what? Those things can't save the film from it's pretty big faults. Most of the magic that seemed to make the first film, and to a lesser extent the second film, so special seems to have been lost through the film's unfocused narrative. This time around the magic feels kind of generic. I also found the editing by Rick Shaine to be inconsistent, as the pace of the film tends to hop infrequently between slow and developmental, to fast and offbeat.As for David Arnold's score, not only was it a big no no to fire Harry Gregson-Williams, but his score also gets a little derivative at times. I couldn't help but be reminded of Pirates of the Caribbean and Edward Scissorhands at points. There's also a somewhat distracting end credits country tune performed by Carrie Underwood, which by itself is quite lovely, but in the context of the film, feels out of place to the fantasy of Narnia.It really does seem like the series has gotten worse with each new film. Either the film makers need to get their acts together (And hire a new editor), or they need to hand it to more capable hands.I give Voyage of the Dawn Treader ** out of ****",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

Anyway, I am not saying this sequel is bad. Actually, it is pretty good. The visuals in all 3 movies were astonishing and breathtaking. The positive in this part was the fact that there were less characters, so the director was more focused on them and we could feel that.

After the failure in Prince Caspian, Andrew Adamson did not want to direct the next Narnia film. Unfortunately, Apted is a horrible replacement. The action scenes are poorly staged and look so fake it is laughable. The visuals that look like they came straight out of an action video game are ugly. Plus Apted's film has little flow from scene to scene. The story and plot lines feel disjointed as the movie goes on. He fails to tell the story in any form, the story does not feel well-told in either visual or literate form. The end result will please die hard Narnia fans but everyone else will be bored to death.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
62,talisencrw,A fine way to either conclude the trilogy--or introduce the possibility of a fourth film!,8,11 April 2016,"Growing up in the Canada in the 70's and 80's, I fondly recall vastly enjoying an animated version of Lewis' 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' that was presented by Kraft on CTV. Now as a father of a son, I want to see with him the contemporary versions of the books I adored in my youth, though at present I greatly prefer the craftsmanship of cinema pre-1970.It never bothers me in the slightest, to the ire of my more obsessive-compulsive cinephilic friends, seeing films of series with complete disregard to their order (one of my friends nearly had a heart attack, when he discovered I had watched 'Spider-Man 3' without having previously watched films 1 and 2--don't even get me started about the 'Harry Potter' series...), so, especially curious about how one of my favourite contemporary directors, Michael Apted, would do in the realm of big-budget, CGI-intensive fantasy filmmaking (I expected a fish-out-of-water, like Lord Richard Attenborough helming 'A Chorus Line'), I gave this a shot.I enjoyed this more than 'Harry Potter' films I have seen, though it does stretch things from the literary works, but unfortunately, that seems to be the way things are, since film became less about artistry and more about business (just see at Toys R Us how many possible toys you can purchase, and similar commercial off-shoots, and I don't even consider this series a major player in this sort of area, because of its Christian undertones, which really doesn't mesh perfectly with selling tons of toys, though of course the realms aren't mutually exclusive, not by any stretch of the imagination). I think that Apted did a decent job, especially considering that yes, he is a fine director, but this isn't really his cup of tea. I distinctly feel that if these films are your comfort food, you won't be disappointed. I look forward to checking out the series' two preceding entries, and, though they left an opportunity for more films, which I believe wouldn't be from Lewis' works at all, it was a nice summation at its conclusion.Finally, it was great to see (or at the very least, hear) Tilda Swinton, Liam Neeson and Simon Pegg, they seem to be thrown in everything these days. I heartily salute their agents--they must have the very best in the business.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
63,FairlyAnonymous,"Not really close to the book, and not really good either",5,6 June 2011,"If it weren't for the ending I would've given this movie 4 out of 10. Since I am a fan of the Chronicles of Narnia books, I kind of had to see this one. The other two movies which were made by Disney weren't bad, but weren't the best. Twentieth Century Fox gets a try, and well... they don't do good.The movie doesn't really make much sense. This really bothered me since I read the books, and I was expecting something along certain lines, but the movie doesn't really follow it. The acting really wasn't all that good which was really distracting, and the dialog wasn't all that better. None of the characters except for possibly Reepacheep, and maybe Eustace when he was a dragon, were likable.For some reason when reading reviews I keep on reading silly comments about how this movie had good visuals. This confused me greatly, because when you see the green mist for the first time it looks awful. I mean really bad. Actually the green mist looked bad in every scene. Why did it look bad? It's mainly because it wasn't integrated well into the scenes. You could tell the mist was put in badly, so when someone looks at the mist floating overhead it looks like the mist isn't even on the same plane. Since the mist was a big part of the movie, seeing it constantly really ruined it for me. The dragon was cool at some scenes, but in others didn't look too good. Now the serpent was pretty cool, but it seemed a bit cartoony, along with the dragon. That was my biggest issue is that both of the monsters in this movie look cartoony, and really bright. Now the water effects in this movie are real good, especially near the end, and when the serpent is splashing.Probably the biggest issue in this movie was the camera. Let me tell you I have never seen camera work this bad. The scenes flowed horribly, and the camera angles were all boring. There were no dynamic camera angles, and emotional shots except for maybe one which was near the end. The camera was also really shaky. I was kind of wondering why they didn't try getting a crane, or something for moving shots. But in all of the moving shots it is someone holding the camera, and when the person holding the camera moves the camera starts rocking back and forth. This was unbearable during conversations, or sword fighting sequences.The scenery was also a bit stale in this movie, especially in the city on the desert island place. It just seems like this movie could have no vegetation which really got old fast. The sets seemed boring, and just ordinary. Only (again) near the end did the sets get a little bit more interesting like on the ancient forest island.IF there is one thing everyone can agree on, it's that the slave catchers battle was incredibly bad, and put together horribly. None of the people in the battle look like they are taking it seriously, and there is almost no threat. The slave capturers just run around, it doesn't seem really intense. The sword combat is pretty lousy, and their moves seem slow. So bad combat scene+bad camera really makes this scene even worse.Now the movie didn't really explain the plot really well, so it wasn't until about the last 20 minutes of the movie did it make some sense. Still it seemed like the plot was thrown in. Why not just keep the plot of the original? I guess it wasn't good enough. Either way the movie did get much better in the last 20 minutes as well. The combat improved with a goofy looking serpent, in a well done dark mist realm that was not green mist. Though since the dark realm did have green mist in it, it started forming green figures that looks quite off. The movie does get better at the end when talking with Aslan and the nice water effects.All in all the movie was a real let-down. This movie has almost no artistic perspective with camera shots, so the movie is overall boring to look at. The effects are good when they need to be, but they are generally bad. I feel like this is evidence that WETA must make all action movies' effects which they already do. The plot was changed, and this left the movie quite confusing. I really feel bad for having to review this movie with a low rating, but trust me, if it weren't for the final last 20 minutes, this would've been a 4/10 and I'm still arguing with myself if I should change it to that.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
64,galensaysyes,"As a movie, a miss; as a version of the book, a mess",5,16 January 2011,"A day after seeing Voyage of the Dawn Treader, with ten years separating it from my last reading of the book, I wrote this about it: This third episode in the Narnia series is obviously striving to avoid the mistakes (both artistic and commercial) of the second: it keeps things moving briskly, makes its dramatic points clearly, and remembers that it was intended for a child audience. It will probably entertain those of that audience who are not readers of C. S. Lewis, but those who are--although they may enjoy it to a degree, as I did--I believe will agree, regretfully, that it still misses the mark.First of all and most of all, it fails to take us back to the world of the first movie, or even of the second: Narnia is a completely different country in each. This robs us of the most fundamental pleasure of a series, that of revisiting a beloved place--and a magical one, which the Narnia of this movie is not, in spite of the appearance of a magician's spell book and a few mythical beasts. Lucy and Edmund, the two returning children, say they love it, but we don't see any evidence they do or any particular reason why they should: it isn't so very wonderful.In spite of smiles and hearty cheers all around, this movie lacks any real joy or lightness of spirit. Even the first movie was heavier than it needed to be, and this one is more so (though less dour than its immediate predecessor). It concentrates on action and peril or the threat of peril, on keeping us anxious most of the time: too anxious, I think, for a children's movie. It has too much of alarm and too little of relief.More important, the stress on the physical slights the moment-to-moment narrative and drama. The movie's script leaves out any number of little moments from the book (as well as whole sections of the plot) and substitutes big ones of its own, which are not out of keeping with the whole but are simply distractions from what we really need to see. For example, we didn't need a little girl to be stowing away on the ship just so we could later witness a teary reunion with her missing mother. But we did need and don't see the moral error and reformation of the one new child protagonist, Eustace. At the beginning he is certainly an odious nuisance, but that's all he is, and his repentance is not shown. Of course at that point he's a dragon, but one with an inexpressive face and without the power of speech (or even the interior monologues he is given at other points in the movie). His redemption by Aslan, we hear him tell about in a brief long shot, a throwaway.The other two protagonists, Lucy and Edmund, hardly communicate with each other, or with their buddy Caspian. The Dawn Treader itself is a gorgeous creation, imaginatively photographed, but we don't get to see how they feel (and therefore we don't feel) what it's like to be in it or to be at sea, and on a Narnian sea. Their adventures at their various ports of call are rushed, not given their full due, so that the myth-like elements--the invisible attackers, the golden pool, the enchanted sleepers--carry little resonance (in contrast to, say, the lamppost or the courtyard of stone figures in the original movie). I'm sorry to say that halfway through the movie my heart sank a little on realizing that the characters still had five of the seven objects of their quest left to work through.According to report, the scheduling of each next Narnian movie will depend on the success of the last Narnian movie. I should judge that the prognosis for The Silver Chair is doubtful. It would carry over none of the original protagonists, only Eustace, and the actor playing that part unfortunately is not very appealing, even reformed (or, if he can be, did not have a chance to show it in this movie). The series has accumulated no momentum because of its intermittency; its failure to carry through the best elements from the first installment; the unavoidable over-aging of its actors; and the separateness of the stories (since unlike Harry Potter and LOTR it is not a continuing serial). It has not even an audience to count on: a child who was 8 when it began will probably have attained to his or her majority before the end, if the producers manage to get through all seven of the books. The unlikeliness of this prospect seems a pity, since the last two have the most movie-suitable stories of all (the Creation and the Revelation, in Narnian terms).And here is my addendum after re-reading the original:I don't know how they did it, but the movie makers managed to mess up all the episodes in the book: every one: changed them, chopped them up, left out the best lines and scenes, sailed right by most of the feelings evoked and most of the messages conveyed. Lewis deserved more appreciative translators.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
65,RichardSRussell-1,"Not a bad movie, just not very good",5,11 December 2010,"The Chronicles of Narnia [3, 3-D]: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (1:52, PG) — other: talking animals, biggie, sequelThe Chronicles of Narnia have been ruffly contemporary with the Harry Potter saga but nowhere near as successful. Even tho the same 4 actors have portrayed the Pevensie siblings in all 3 films so far, none of them is as memorable as the 10th-billed supporting character from any Potter movie. And, while the names Harry, Ron, and Hermione trip readily off the tongue, most people who didn't grow up with C. S. Lewis's novels would have to scratch their heads awhile to come up with the equivalent Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy.In this 3rd in the series, Peter and Susan get maybe 2 minutes screen time combined, as they take refuge from WW2 in America, leaving Edmund (the bland and forgettable Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) in the care of unseen geonklos and under the withering judgment of their resentful younger cousin Eustace Scrubb (Will Poulter). In the same displaced-British-cousin tradition depicted in Nanny McPhee Returns, Eustace is torn between snottiness and snobbery and settles for a double dose of each. He is easily the most irritating character since Jar-Jar Binks, except without the redeeming competence.It was probably a conscious decision on the part of director Michael Apted to have Poulter oversell the obnoxity, since that puts into even starker contrast his supposed reformation (which, in any Lewis work, carries the subtext of ""redemption"") after having been turned into a dragon and back. Apted probably also told Henley that humans always respond favorably to a smile, so when in doubt, smile like crazy.* And this kid is in doubt a lot, calling up the old expression ""When all around you are losing their heads, maybe they know something you don't.""Edmund once again finds himself playing 2nd fiddle, this time to Ben Barnes, reprising his role as Caspian from the eponymous 2nd film, except that now he's the king, not merely a prince. He and the 3 kids, plus the voice of Simon Pegg as the valiant mouse Reepicheep, carry the plot, such as it is.This is essentially a picaresque adventure, a quest in search of an ill-explained mcguffin, the 7 swords of the 7 lords, which, if crossed upon the banquet table of Aslan, will fend off the latest threat to the realm, a green fog which apparently is able to teleport itself hundreds of miles away from its home base on Dark Island to abscond with boatloads of sacrificial peasants. The titular ship, the Dawn Treader, hops from island to island, with a different adventure at each stop along the way until the grand climactic battle with a giant sea serpent, conjured into existence by Edmund's imagination in much the same way as the giant Sta-Puft marshmallow man in Ghostbusters.Had the stupidest of the crew been blessed with even a single game's experience at D&D, they would have known enuf to set somebody on watch every night, but they don't even learn from their failure to do so the 1st couple of times, giving rise to what Roger Ebert calls the ""idiot plot"", one in which the entire story would fall apart if even 1 character did something sensible or reasonable.For me, the most irritating aspect of these films is something endemic to Lewis's source novels, namely the mincing around the Christian apologetics. I always find myself wondering why everybody always fawns all over Aslan (the king of beasts as avatar of the king of kings), since he hardly ever does much except show up at the end to take the credit. And if he really IS such hot stuff, why does he need all these other guys? Perhaps more to the point, why did he let things get so bad in the 1st place? But that starts us down the Theodicy Thruway, which leads to the part of Mere Christianity City that the Lewis Visitors' Bureau fervently hopes the tourists never discover.Trying nervously to strike a balance, screenwriters Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, and Michael Petroni leave us with such incongruities as Aslan telling the kids that he goes by another name in their world, but then they don't ask the obvious questions, like ""What is it?"" or ""Can I get your e-mail address?"".So, after having trashed the film up to this point, what led me to rate it a 5 (average)? Well, it's handsomely mounted, the effects are quite good (aside from the improbably slow-developing sandy footprints from the 1-footed hoppers, tech apparently unchanged since 1956's Forbidden Planet**), and the score by David Arnold is effective if not memorable. It is seldom dreary, and the cinematography is not afraid of color. I wasn't able to see it in 3-D, but I could readily imagine places where it would have enhanced the experience, particularly during the watery transits to and from Narnia.So it's partly *ahem* redeemed from its sins.–––––*much the same advice handed out by Morena Baccarin on V, I'm sure**starring Leslie Nielsen, RIP",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

67,kunalkhandwala,Narnian in essence yet shallow in fun and excitement,6,12 December 2010,"Perhaps the most moralistic of C.S. Lewis' Narnia novels would be 'The Voyage of the Dawn Treader', which is episodic in style with the Dawn Treader's aimless journey through Narnian seas. Michael Apted takes the helm of direction and brings this adventure to us in 3D; the first for Narnia.Susan and Peter (King & Queen) have grown up now and reside in America where Narnia has no access. The teenagers Lucy (Georgie Hensley) and Edmund (Skander Keynes) who are in Britain in the midst of WW2, along with their unnerving cousin Eustace (Will Poulter) catch the moving waters in a painting in their room. Soon, the water flows into the room and in a spectacular fashion, they are underwater, only to be pulled up by Prince Caspian in front of the hull of the Dawn Treader. Welcome to Narnia! The trio are briefly introduced to the ship's crew that include the swashbuckling mouse Reepicheep and a Narnian buffalo sailor. Their initial inquiry about Narnia's state of affairs and the Dawn Treader's voyage reveal the book and film's weakness - Prince Caspian admits that there are no problems in Narnia. Peace rules the lands and barring the exploration of the farthest stretches of the waters where Aslan's country mythically exists, the ship has little to do on its voyage. Thus, they decide to go island hopping where, just on the first one, they are taken as prisoners and almost sold as slaves until a heroic rescue by the crew saves the day. It is within the walls of the prison that Prince and Edmund find out about the 7 missing lords and their magical swords. Oh and there's a LOST like smoke monster that devours boats full of slaves. The most striking aspect about 'The Chronicles of Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader' is that it lacks the mystery, build up and joy of discovery of the first movie. At the same time, it eliminates the excessive CGI and Lord of the Rings inspired battle sequences from the second installment and thus proves to be a closer- to- book adaptation. The focus is on retaining Narnia's adventures as an escape for children with funny bits that are memorable especially the endless picking of Eustace by the witty Reepicheep and the monopodial dwarfs on the island. Deeper into the story's entertaining layers, Evil tempts the protagonists in different ways and overcoming the lure is the didactic experience of C.S. Lewis' edition that is well captured by Michael Apted. Lucy's battle against her temptation to be as beautiful as her sister, Edmund's envy of Prince Caspian's position as the leader and Eustace's greed that draws him to hidden treasures are all lessons to be learnt in the battle of good v/s evil. On one hand, the white witch tempts Edmund to join the evil forces while Aslan, in his Christ like rendition guides Lucy on the right path. The special effects involving the sea serpent in the cove are excellent and provide an ugly yet thrilling experience in 3D while the magical touches through the book of incarnations and entry to Aslan's country are simply enchanting to look at. Discovery of the 7 lords and their swords is itself a moral journey for everyone and while C.S. Lewis did brilliantly in detailing those aspects, Apted is short of time and just like all Narnian films, this one too falls short of the book's magical effect. But then again, Michael Apted is no Peter Jackson. The climax is a sad farewell to what we were introduced to just 2 movies ago but The Silver Chair may prove to be an altogether different experience with Eustace. Will Poulter's brilliantly convincing portrayal of the annoying kid is the highlight of the film and the focus on him is a well thought out plan for the upcoming movies. Georgie Hensley IS Lucy as C.S. Lewis had once imagined and therefore, her presence is always charming. The rest of the cast could've done better with more focus on their characters had it not been for the time constraint; which, Apted has wisely been strict about. The shortest of the 3 films, yet least action packed, 'Voyage of the Dawn Treader' betters its predecessor by being closer to the book with moral implications and child-like adventures. The film is beautiful to look at but it leaves you craving for more fun, more adventure and sometimes, more heroism. It is by no means uplifting and we do miss Aslan in action at the required times. This is Aslan's shortest time on screen and that is a tragedy for the film indeed. Nevertheless, for loyal fans of Narnia, this is purely Narnian in essence but not an epic by motion picture standards. 7.033 on a scale of 1-10.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
68,Fields201,Shockingly Good,7,10 December 2010,"I wasn't a big fan of the first Narnia. I walked out of there thinking it was purely average and the story has been done countless times before in other films. Having said that, I skipped out on the second Narnia. The previews didn't convince me that I would change my opinion so I never bothered with it. Then years later I see the previews of the third installment and thought, ""Wow, this actually looks pretty good."" It reminded me of Pirates of the Caribbean in a way and some video games that I played and decided to give it a go.The wifey and I had a date night with this and both of us walked out of enjoying it very much. It didn't start out that way. The beginning of the movie, though okay, didn't exactly grab me. In fact, our heroes are whisked away to Narnia quite early, and we are introduced to all the main characters of the movie right from the get go. The only ones that stood out, to me, was that Useless character (at least that's what his name sounds like) who, in spite of some rather bland characters and sometimes bland moments, sticks out among the rest. Even when a certain plot twist with his transformation occurs, he's still an interesting character. He's really the best character in the movie, besides that lion that I can think of. Maybe the swashbuckling rat and that human bull would rank up there too.Between the drab moments, we get a lot of creative ideas like the land of invisible people and some mansion that can't be seen. Our heroes have to go into some dangerous territory in search of seven lords that carry these swords that must be joined together to vanquish the darkness and put balance into Narnia (I never knew what balance actually means myself). Along the way, there are a lot of characters in their party and some serious character development, especially with Caspian and Useless. There are a couple characters in the group that I felt was useless (pardon the pun) by the end of the movie. They have this father join the group (with his stowaway daughter) that never really served much of a purpose. The fawn from the first one gets on board but he's just there. He could have been left out and nothing would be missed.One last thing I would like to mention is that I really enjoyed this score. Not too many movies (or video games) with an orchestrated soundtrack have been noteworthy lately. The score isn't memorable by any means, but it was easy on the ears and it may be the first soundtrack in a while that I might just own.Oh, and I didn't see it in 3D. I hate 3D. I advise people to see this without 3D, as well. Films should be enjoyed by their narrative and scope. They should draw you into the film by its storytelling, not with a gimmick. I hope filmmakers don't forget this. I'm afraid that will be the Dawn Treader of movie-going.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
69,priyantha-bandara,Should have being better,6,20 March 2011,"Chronicles of Narnia has always being a movie franchise comes in the fore front of fantasy titles in the past recent years. Alongside its main rival Harry Potter which was bigger than life at some editions it still managed to enchant a good load of fans around the globe. Starting from 'Lion, Witch & the Wardrobe' (2005) and getting better and better with the 'Prince Caspian' (2008) it had returned with its latest edition 'The Voyage of the Dawn Treader' (2010). Thought to my amusement is a wee bit weaker than the first two movies I must say.Lucy and Edmund Pevensie are called back in to Narnia again and this time with their annoyingly big mouthed cousin Eustace. They meet Prince Caspian and join a trip across seas on the royal ship Dawn Treader. In this voyage of reaching the edge of the world they encounter various threats, dangers and creatures which at times amuse them and at times testing their skills to the brim.The plot is well created yet it could have being more comparing with the first two movies. For example the most colossus fantasy franchise ever 'Lord of the Rings' were capable of creating the most amazing 3rd edition with the 'Return of the king' and that's how a fantasy movie should go down in history. Here I see lot of action but less potential to be great.The animation and CG quality is at its best. Coming out in HD the thrill is spectacular if you are in a position to watch it that way. Even the smallest details are carefully given attention which is a must. This brings back some memories from movies like the Lord of the rings and Clash of the Titans.Very good astonishing and loud score contributes to the thrills quite a lot while the set department creating the wonderfully detailed sets for each occasion.A good load of hard work is surely has gone in to creating 'The Voyage of the Dawn Treader' no doubt. But it's a question if that hard work truly delivers something memorable once it finishes. Yes there are some things unique about this movie but not as unique as there are many movies which hit the screens with fantasy magnet in the back.

The 10% of the time that the 3D-ness was actually used, it was pretty cool but most of the time, it's just an excuse to charge more for the ticket. I mean the adverts that came before used more of the whole 3D effect.2. Lucy's obsession with wanting to look like Susan was a bit weird. Lucy actually ~becoming~ Susan was even weirder. Still, it meant that we had Anna Popplewell on screen. (Has anyone read the book more recently than me and can tell me how close the film followed the book and what was changed? Was this entire storyline completely invented?) 3. The picture Lucy had of Susan and Peter in the photo frame in her room was one of my favourite behind-the-scenes photos 4. Cousin Eustace was really annoying for the first half of the film but then *spoiler* happened and he was less annoying.5. Caspian/Edmund vying for power .... total throw back to Caspian/Peter having the same fight. Edmund has a serious inferiority complex. He was much less annoying in this film though.6. Tilda Swinton always freaks me out.7. Reepicheep and Aslan ..... SO FREAKING CUTE. Yes, I know that they are animated characters but I want to hug them.8. Most importantly, WHAT THE FLIPPING HELL HAPPENED TO CASPIAN'S DODGY European ACCENT?!?!?!?!? He's back to being British all of a sudden! Did they watch Prince Caspian through and realise how awful it was that they just decided to scrap it?! HAVE THEY HEARD OF CONTINUITY???!?!?!?!?! Is there an interview out there where this question is brought up? Please say there is! (ETA: Found it ....... they just realised that CS Lewis was a quintessentially English writer which is why the Telmarines became British instead of some flavour of Spanish all of a sudden?!?!?!).Anyone else feel like this film was Pirates Of The Caribbean meets The Hobbit meets Harry Potter (especially that scene in the Magician's House) with a tiny bit of Narnia thrown in for good measure? Lol. It was good, though. The CG work was amazing.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
71,jml1988,"Not as great as the first, but still a good movie",7,12 December 2019,"I'm a huge fan of the books and have read them all many times. This movie fell a little short of the others, but still was enjoyable.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
72,MovieProductions,This voyage wasn't worth taking,5,3 January 2011,"** out of (****)After being immersed in the highly invigorating experience that was ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" and being utterly disappointed with the stale inevitable sequel ""Prince Caspian"", I didn't know what to quite expect for the forthcoming installment. Unsurprisingly, ""Dawn Treader"" is a notch or two above ""Prince Caspian"", but pales in comparison to its second predecessor. Not to mention that the 3D is post-converted rather than filmed, and it's blatant. While the action sequences are thrilling and climactic, and the set designs are quite ravishing, there's nothing else this picture has to offer. It's like wrapping a Christmas with the most luxurious and beautiful wrapping paper, but putting nothing in the box.The biggest downfall of the film is its mediocrity. Nothing is amazing, nothing is abysmal. Dawn Treader has the worst case scenario: it's just average. Average performances. Average 3D. Average script. If this movie were an epic win (""The Dark Knight"") or an epic fail (""The Last Airbender""), that would be fun to see. Instead, it's just a run-of-the-mill fantasy extravaganza that had potential. And that my friends is more disheartening than a film that had zero chance at quality and being subpar. First up are the performances. I absolutely loathed the character Eustace. No seriously, I LOATHED him. He is the whiniest, brattiest, and most obnoxious person to grace the silver screen. Even after making his so-called apology, I still wanted him to get eaten by Aslan. All the other characters, with the exception of Lucy, were just alright. I would hardly call these bunch of kids ""heroic"" or ""charismatic"". Lucy is pretty much the only character I cared about. I thought Susan was the best but they just HAD to kick her off!Not only that but the script is so uninteresting. While I admired some of its symbolism, in the end, its your typical action story. You'd think the epic fighting sequences and its production designs would save that right? Wrong. Yes, the action and visuals were easy on the eyes and beautiful, haven't we all seen it before? I hate to sound like a broken record but how many times do I have to say it? Post. converted. movies. never. look. good. ""Clash of the Titans"", ""Alice in Wonderland"", and I assume ""The Last Airbender"" had some of the worst 3D I've seen and ""My Soul To Take"" was decent but had zero depth. First off, there's no depth. The only time the 3D kicks in is when its used as a gimmick. Even for gimmicky intentions, it's still a little lackluster. Furthermore, the film looks darker than it should and scenes don't ""pop"". Still, the 3D isn't ""awful"" but it's just average.Overall, ""Treader"" would've made a solid fantasy action extravaganza had it not been so mediocre. The picture is paced very tediously, the 3D is decent and best, and most of the actors are uncharismatic and dull. The script, I suppose, is above average but nothing to write home about. The action and the set designs are this film's only redeeming qualities but couldn't you just re-watch the first Narnia, indulge in its greatness, and just call it a night? This voyage wasn't worth taking.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
73,BigWhiskers,Movie is good but too many lulls in the action,7,12 December 2010,"The movie does have some spectacular scenery but suffers from too much bland storytelling . Lack of action and some stiff acting also hurts it. We get to see the two younger pevensie kids return to Narnia, their older siblings are basically done with Narnia so we get introduced to their annoying cousin. They travel this time to find 7 lost lords and 7 swords to destroy an evil malignant entity that has take the form of an island. Some of the action is good but there is far too much emphasis on long drawn out scenes of boring chatter. Overall I give it a 7/10. The franchise could be running out of steam as more and more people are going to see Harry Potters finale and just are getting too stretched out with all these franchise movie anthologies. I mean how many people are going to be into both.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
74,Willie-12,Perhaps My Expectations Were Too High,6,11 December 2010,"After seeing The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, I remember thinking to myself, ""that was a really good kids movie that even the adults can enjoy."" After seeing Prince Caspian, I remember thinking, ""that was a great movie, period."" In fact, Prince Caspian is on my list of top five movies from 2008. So needless to say, my expectations for The Voyage of the Dawn Treader were pretty darn high. Unfortunately, after seeing Dawn Treader, it appears that they may have been too high. This is not a bad film. In fact, there are some sequences that worked quite well (the picture on the wall that takes the kids back to Narnia comes to mind). And when it was all said and done, it was still a mildly entertaining piece of cinema. The problem with Dawn Treader, though, becomes more apparent when you begin to add up the sum of it's parts. Quite frankly, there were some scenes that felt as if they didn't belong. One example is where Edmund and Caspian almost come to blows at the pool of water that turns items (and people if they fall in) to gold. Up until that point, there was no indication of feelings of animosity between them. The scene felt forced, as if the makers of the film deemed it necessary to include some tension between Caspian and Edmund, akin to the tension that existed between Caspian and Peter in the previous film. It's a scene that transitioned poorly, and didn't feel genuine. And there were others as well. Finally, the screenplay wasn't as crisp as it was in the first two films and the editing left something to be desired. All of this leads to a film that's a bit disjointed. Indeed, when it was over, I had the feeling that I'd just seen some good pieces of what could, and should have been a very good film. However, just as a puzzle can never be complete until the pieces are put in the right place, Dawn Treader is a film that feels incomplete. Some of its pieces are just in the wrong place, while others, seem as if they don't belong at all.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
75,joshuabush-34620,I was pleasantly surprised! Magical.,9,8 March 2021,This series impresses me with its consistent quality. Not a single bad movie in the series! This was very well done.,The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
76,brent_or,"Not perfect, but wonderfully enchanting...",7,13 August 2012,"I will say this for Voyage of the Dawn Treader, it has some of the most genuinely magical visuals, and an oscillating feel of wonderment that keeps coming in waves throughout the film. I have not read the book, so that boosted the drama for me, not knowing what was coming next. The best thing about it is still the actors, especially Georgie Henley as Lucy (she is really what has made all of the Narnia films work) and Ben Barnes as Caspian (but what happened to his accent?) Edmund is okay, but his character development/involvement is pretty weak here.Again, the visuals are just wonderful, be they the set pieces, panoramas, or visual effects for stars, maps and monsters. Oddly, the ship itself does not look real to me from a distance, but no great problem there. The ending is truly stirring, and like in Prince Caspian, touched with a little melancholy.The overall plot is decent, but again the character development is not entirely convincing. Which brings me to Eustace. He is played very well. However, somehow it is still hard for me to buy his change of character, even after being beat over the head with it for much of the film, and I have to say that I would not look forward to future films in which he is the star. And the talking mouse annoys me to no end. What I really always want to see is the original four siblings, but I know that they have to move on. That is the melancholy.Also, just to note, the Christian themes come through more strongly here than on either of the previous films. Sometimes the integration into the story feels a bit awkward, but either way, that is the nature of the source material.Ultimately, this is just about as truly entrancing a film as there is, in spite of whatever imperfections it has. I wish that I had seen it in the theater. A terrific cinematic experience, I would think.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
77,JokerMichel,Entertaining,5,15 May 2018,"I watched it , and I enjoyed it . But , the movie plot was weak , not as good as its prequels.

78,aaronjbong,A Narnia Film That Expands Its Contents Beautifully From the Previous Two,9,4 December 2010,"It's been five years from ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" debuted on theaters. The Pevensies have grown up. The first movie would see a very young Lucy still with a cute face like a first-grader. In this movie, she looks like she's in seventh grade or eight grade. Seems like time flows like Narnian time here. ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" marks the third film in the Narnia franchise. It follows King Caspian in a journey to find the seven lost lords of Narnia whom King Miraz banished during his reign in the previous film with his ship, the Dawn Treader. On the way, he met Edmund, Lucy and their pathetic cousin, Eustace Scrubb who turned out to have a change in the movie. However, there's this horrifying green mist that can tempt you to do things that can lead up to bad things and the whereabouts of these lost lords are unknown. So, these people take on a journey that passes the beyond the Silver Sea (which must be really somewhere very east) and to the ""End of the World"". END of the world not those doomsday things.""Voyage"" is actually a very enjoyable film for both kids and adults alike. The adventures were really great and breathtaking and should be a good way to take people's spare time. Its story is understandable for young kids and its characters are enjoyable and fun to befriend with especially the mouse, Reepicheep. ""Voyage"" will actually give good laughs to its audience with its jokes especially with the appearance of the Pevensies' coward, pathetic Eustace Scrubb who actually changed ever since he visited Narnia. His actions are the main source of laughs here. His acting also maximized the laughs in this film and I think comedy is what strengthens this movie. ""Voyage"" is also powerful in exciting action scenes. This is what seems to be lacking in the previous films even in the climax where it doesn't seem that exciting. ""Voyage's"" climax is very exciting and deserves to be called a climax. The setting of the scene was well-suited and the scene was shot beautifully. Definitely awesome. But, this movie is quite dark for very young children especially in the climax part. It has grown quite scarier than the previous ones.""Voyage"" also has a new director allowing the series to turn into a quite different style of film. While the previous ones were really too childish, this third one puts on several scenes to attract an older audience. Michael Apted replacing Andrew Adamson is definitely an advance in the Narnia film series.However, Narnian fans will miss Peter and Susan Pevensie as they would not return as main characters but rather just as cameos. The reason in the story why they didn't return is that they're now too old to return to Narnia. This movie will only see two Pevensies plus their cousin, Eustace Scrubb. What a pity.The 3D effects of the film were actually acceptable. They are actually quite conspicuous and are good. 3D or 2D would be OK in watching this movie.You might notice that the Pevensies have grown a lot over the five years gap between the first film and this third film. Compared to the Harry Potter series which had a 3-year gap between the first and third film, Narnia had a longer gap. As it is also a seven-book series, I'm quite worried how it will end up in the final film(even though some of the installments don't include the Pevensies). Let's just hope they have no problem encountering this situation. About its loyalty to the book, the movie did have some changes and some of them are quite major, QUITE not REALLY (be careful). The arrangement of scenes were also ordered in a new way. In the middle of the book starting to the end, that's where the movie's change was big. But, for me, it was acceptable and let's hope that it's acceptable for other fans of the book.""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" (what a long title it is) is absolutely a must-watch film for this holiday season and is very suitable for Christmas. Rather than watching some bloody films people, merry up and rather watch something appropriate for Christmas and in 3D if you prefer. It's definitely great and perfect for families to watch. Prince AJB's Score: 9/10 (90%)Thanks for reading my review and hope it's useful.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
79,FilmFanatic03,They aren't improving as the films go on!,6,19 December 2010,"This film seemed like the film where many challenges would be encountered, obstacles to overcome and to make a huge epic spectacular of it all. But, it didn't measure up to what i would expect from an adventure movie at sea would be like. The mission felt too easily accomplished, they have to find the swords of the lost kings to bring peace to Narnia, so when they started their journey it was like: arrive at an island, heres a sword, move on over and over again. There was no ""meat"" to the adventures. Plus i felt Georgie Henley (lucy) and Skandar Kenyes (Edmund) were quite shallow in acting, during the climatic parts Edmund would shout but not convey any emotion in his performance. The boy who played Esutace was really good. In all fairness the last epic scene was amazing plus, at least there was more fantasy to the film the the previous Narnia film. But still, it feels that so far with each new Narnia film, they lose that quality which should make it amazing. The first one had the family feel to it and it was action packed and had emotion in, the second lacked that family feel but had substance to the plot but this one has gone slightly down as it just felt it lacked emotion and substance. Well, hopefully they can redeem themselves with the future Narnia films",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
80,JTurner82,Another great NARINA tale... albeit out on sea.,8,11 December 2010,"I knew it would happen. From the moment the opening titles came across the screen, I could feel the nostalgic magic so prevalent in the first NARNIA movie seeping in, and it stayed that way for me the whole time. The major difference, of course, is the set-up of the story. Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund Pevensie (Skander Keyes), both approaching adulthood, are staying with their obnoxious cousin, Eustace (Will Poulter) when they notice a beautiful painting of a fantastical ship sailing on the ocean waters. And of course, the picture comes to life, resulting with the squabbling children washed on the deck of the ship in question, the Dawn Treader, where their old friend, Caspian (Ben Barnes), now a bona-fide king, welcomes them. It turns out that Caspian is searching for the seven lords that were banished from Narnia during the reign of his evil uncle. Accompanied by the swashbuckling mouse warrior, Reepicheep (voiced by Simon Pegg), the youngsters travel to various islands across the oceans in search of them. And will Aslan (voiced, once more, by Liam Neeson) be there to help them? You betcha.In addition to being a seagoing adventure (inevitable since most of the action takes place on the titular vessel), this tale also deals with spiritual matters. Rather than matching wits against an evil menace as with the last two films (although the White Witch does make some brief cameo appearances), the major conflict deals with Lucy, Edmund, Caspian, and especially Eustace, all dealing with their own inner demons. Each island adventure places the quartet through a series of psychological trials that they must overcome. Lucy gets to have a very memorable dream sequence in which she imagines she's as beautiful as Susan, but naturally, it's Eustace who has the most growing up to do.In the beginning of the film, Eustace is just about what you would expect from Lewis' text--he's snobbish, selfish, and condescending, delighting in bullying others while declaring himself superior. He hates his cousins and quickly makes an enemy out of Reepicheep, who, at one point, chastises him for grabbing his most precious attribute: ""No one touches the tail!"" And just when you've had enough of him, he is transformed into a fire-breathing dragon midway through the film. This is where Eustace's character development really begins, as Reepicheep takes him under his, well, paws, and inspires him to do the right thing. This above-mentioned dynamic is the heart of the entire picture, and most of the credit goes to Will Poulter and Simon Pegg for their chemistry. Poulter does a bang-up job of making Eustace bratty and unlikeable, and his maturation is a joy to behold. This guy seriously needs an award for his performance. Pegg, although vocally different from predecessor Eddie Izzard, is a delight as the mouse warrior; his voice is a cross between John Cleese and Cary Elwes, which captures his attitude to a T and beyond. He has the best lines in the picture and obviously has fun with his role--although the real success to the character is the very convincing computer-animated effects that bring the mouse to life.That's one of the many memorable aspects of VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER, which isn't to say that it is without its faults. The film is directed by Michael Apted (the previous ones by Andrew Adamson), and he moves the tale along at a rapid pace, making it the breeziest (and shortest) of the NARNIA films. However, I do have some qualms about both his direction and the adaptation; one of them is the scene where Eustace shows himself as a dragon for the first time. Rather than having him see his reflection in the water, Apted decides instead to show Eustace's charred clothes, and then have his dragon form fly out of nowhere. This disappointed me somewhat, as I felt that Lewis' original description of this moment was more powerful. Furthermore, the encounter with Lilandi (Laura Brent), Caspian's future queen, is dealt with rather quickly. An extra five minutes to show Caspian's affection for the girl wouldn't have hurt. Finally, although the film is faithful to the novel for the most part, there is at least one addition that felt very pointless--a girl named Gael (Arabella Morton) who stows away with her father in search of her missing parents. The new character doesn't have a particularly compelling personality and feels so irrelevant that one wonders why the screenwriters included her at all.But that is, truthfully, the only quibbles I have to say about THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER. At first I wasn't so sure about the newly invented subplots concerning the search for the missing swords of the seven lords or a menacing green mist that appears every time a character is tempted, but in the end, I ultimately ended up approving them wholeheartedly. This especially works in favor of the climactic fight against one of the ugliest sea serpents ever committed to film, which is occasionally interspersed with ghostly images of Tilda Swinton's White Witch tempting Edmund to join her. Although longer than in the book, this sequence is nonetheless very thrilling and arguably a more epic scene than in the original.Every other aspect of the picture is exactly what one would ask for from a NARNIA adventure. The cinematography and visual effects are both breathtaking and gorgeous to look, and David Arnold's score is amazingly epic, occasionally using some of original composer Harry Gregson-Williams' original tunes at various points in the movie. And the principal actors all perform as wonderfully as they did in their predecessors.There are some differences from the book that purists may quibble with, and a couple of scenes that could stand to be either better or at least more fleshed out, but nonetheless it is a pleasure to join the Pevensies on one final adventure in the world of talking animals, monsters, prophecies and enchantment.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
81,RichardKleiner,An improvement in many ways,9,15 December 2010,"Disney's biggest blunder in a while. There really is no excuse in abandoning a franchise like that. First, it's a series that worked fantastically as literature. Second, audience expectations were set higher with this part. And third, as it has been established before, this was supposedly the most successful book in the series.One of my primary concerns is the double titles trend, where it becomes quite tedious to recite ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"". Perhaps if it were just ""Narnia: TVoDT"" it would be easier to read aloud. But everyone just utters ""Narnia 3"".Anyway, the story leaves the older Pevensie children behind and concentrates on Lucy and Edmund, who already look quite old themselves, and adding a cousin, Esutace. This particular entry in the Narnia series is different from the previous ones mainly because there are no epic army vs. army battles, but more like a series of quests. The story itself is rather formulaic, where our heroes must go from one point to the next to retrieve a special object, etc, etc. The ""real world"" side of the story is dissed very quickly, actually. The first Narnia added a whole lot of background with the kids, living during the war and all, but the sequels don't seem to care that much anymore and go to Narnia straight away.As a fantasy movie, it's nothing you haven't heard before, still, it manages to refresh the screen after so many unimaginative CGI ""epics"". Fearing that the franchise wouldn't be too successful, the ending actually is rather smart. It goes full circle with the Pevensie story, although it does leave Eustace out there without any more development.As for the characters, all three movies have been slim on the roaster, and this one is no exception. Lucy and Eustace get the most development, and Edmund is curiously set aside most of the time. Aside of Caspian, Repicheep and the ever present Aslan, the rest of the characters are rather anonymous.Naturally, the effects come first when talking about this movie, and the artists delivered. Sure, most of the creatures look fake (except for the superbly rendered Minotaur), but most of the CGI works fantastically. A special mention goes to the final scene, where the kids return to their room and the water slowly goes down while they remain dry.Much anticipation came with David Arnold composing the score, having not worked on this type of genre before, but the music is great. It does improve from Harry Gregson-Williams' lovely but unmemorable score, rescuing some minor themes, but making the score his own. Can't wait to get it.As a whole, the third Narnia is a step forward in several aspects from its predecessors. It clearly isn't the best movie in the series (I think it is yet to be made) but it's fun, exciting and decent entertainment. The Christian themes are much more prominent here than in ""Prince Caspian"", but I don't have issues with them, honestly.I would regret if they don't adapt the next books, but from the looks of it, the economic measure would be to adapt ""The Last Battle"" and be done with the film series. The other books may not be essential to the main story arc, but I'd still love to see them on film. But there has to be a fourth movie.Ah, well, greed is everything in Hollywood.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
82,jmmustchin,Third time a winner,10,30 June 2018,"Walden Media has done it again with a third wonderful Narnian fantasy adventure. The plot, the action, the effects, the acting and the humour all soar high! Despite being quite different from the book, it is quite good in its own right. Will Poulter does a fantastic job as the comically annoying Eustace Scrubb, who provides heaps of comedy (Poulter is the best actor in the film). The ending is also pretty good emotionally. It also has both the best effects and highest level of effects in the series. All in all, a good movie and a welcome ending to the trilogy.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
83,bonniejoy-978-68763,"Good, not Great",6,2 May 2014,"I guess you can tell from the title that I didn't die hard love this movie, but neither did I hate it. I love the Chronicles of Narnia (all the books/stories) and Voyage of the Dawn Treader is one of my favorites.The major problems I have with this movie is that it seems to be an exact replica of Prince Caspian (the movie version) only this time using Edmund and Lucy. What I mean is in the previous movie, Peter had pride issues as High King, and Edmund gets that in this movie too. That bothers me not only because it's not in the original story, but also because I feel like I'm seeing the Prince Caspian movie again, only this time with seas. But the biggest thing that bugs me is that the White Witch comes back! How long are we going to see her? The last movie had an excuse for why she made a cameo, but this one didn't. What's even worse is that she keeps offering Edmund a kingdom and he acts like he wants to fall for her trick. Hasn't that been in the first film? Heck, in the second film he gets rid of her ghost when Peter starts falling for her, and now we're going to drop all that and say, ""He's not learned anything from his latest adventures""? I'll go into what I like. The story on its own merits is really good. I like the way its told about the dangers of temptation, fighting against it, and all in the process of saving that entire world. Oh and Eustace is terrific! I love him! He's bratty, nasty, sneaky, not very tough, and eventually has a change of heart. I was looking forward to him swinging Reepicheep by the tail and being beat up by him, however the duel scene was just as good. I was just laughing my pants off at how he was fighting a talking mouse. In fact the mouse, Reepicheep is also funny, and fantastic. I love when he fights and how he's not afraid of anything, and I also love his sincere moments especially when he longs to go to Aslan's country. That was a really tender moment. Eustace as a dragon was awesome. He had Eustace's human attitude, and when he fights off the serpent it's cool. And I should bring up, the fight scenes, though not as intense as the last film are pretty heavy, especially the last one. And I'm always glad to see Aslan in the movie. The way he teaches Lucy and Eustace lessons are pretty hard and sink in. The one line that he gave which I had been waiting the entire movie for, ""I am (in your world) but there I have another name.........."" That summed up the point of the kids being in Narnia in the first place and while the directors left out some of the scenes I would have liked to see on screen, that one line made me forgive it all.I like it as a movie, and I hope they make more.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
84,AbeStreet,Wonderful Film!!!,8,7 July 2014,"THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER (VotDT) is a relatively good film, even better than the story is the production attention to detail and development. Of all seven books that make up the Narnia stories I have long felt that VotDT is my second to least favorite. THE LAST BATTLE is my least favorite story. Anyway, while the book never quite engaged me I have felt that the 1989 BBC film production and Fox's recent film were both quite good and each is probably my favorite when compared with the other film productions they were a part of.I saw VotDT in the theater and in 3D. The 3d didn't really do much for me. However I was really impressed with the attention to detail that went into costumes, scene location sets, and especially the Dawn Treader set itself. While the story didn't quite adhere to the exact details of the voyages contained in the book the ship itself was a thing of beauty. If you watch the extra features on the Blu-Ray DVD you will find just how much detail went into every little aspect of the ship. While I did not notice all the detail outright when first watching the film I can see, after watching the special feature, why I was so taken with the ship itself.The teen actor that portrayed Eustace Scrubb did a remarkable job. If THE SILVER CHAIR is to be made I hope it is soon as I'm sure the actor will soon if not already become a young adult. Lastly, the end credits are beautifully well done. The song ""There's a Place for us"" performed by Carrie Underwood is perfectly paired with the original artwork from the novel, illustrated by Pauline Baynes. A perfect way to marry the novel and film together.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
85,holyspiritdriven,Excellent and Accurate Movie Adaptation!,10,3 January 2011,"The underlying basis for this being such a powerful movie comes directly form its writer, CS Lewis. A literary master and deep, thought provoking philosophical thinker, he was able to weave an incredible allegory into a completely original archetypal fantasy series. The Dawn Treader, a third installment of the 7 part Chronicles is the latest of the most modern movie adaptations and exceeds Prince Caspian in stunning imagery. I haven't read up on why Disney dropped the production of these but I'd just like to say to Disney ""oops"". My mother read most of these books to me when I was a kid & then I read them all on my own about 7 or 8 years ago. I have been impressed so far with accuracy (as far as I can remember) of these movies. Could this or that have been done better? Probably, but I am fully aware that no movie adaptation can ever compete with how you imagined the story when you first read it.

86,theycallmemrglass,Splendid adaption if you get over some bad dialogue,7,30 November 2010,"I have watched this film in 3d at a preview screening in London.First of all, I do not recommend anyone watching this in 3d. It is too dark and the action is just a motion blur. It's dreadful.As for the film, there is much to enjoy with excellent visual effects, action set pieces (though ruined for me by the 3D) and a couple of stand out characters. But unfortunately there is also much to cringe at in some bouts of terrible dialogue.The characters of Reepicheep (the kick-ass warrior mouse) and Eustace, (the obnoxious brat cousin) were the most fun with the actor playing Eustace demonstrating excellent comic timing. The relationship between them was funny and touching. And they even brought much needed zest to the action.But alarmingly, Edmund and Lucy seem to have deteriorated as actors. Some of their emotions are too forced which is a pity. Not sure why, as I would expect them to improve with each film as did the young cast of the Harry Potter movies.Overall, the story has surprisingly been well adapted considering not a great deal actually happens in the book. But the pacing is good, even though a little episodic. There are much more Christian analogies once again which would please many and irritate others. But I rather like all of the analogies.I do feel however, that amongst adults, mostly those who enjoyed the Narnia books will enjoy this more than non readers of the books because the story is too bizarre even for a fantasy! But I think most children will enjoy this immensely, regardless if they read the books or not.With better written dialogue and better handling of the child performances (namely Lucy and Edmund), this could have been a much better film but as its stands its an enjoyable enough entry in this series.Oh and I will say it again, do not watch this in 3d.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
87,dutchs-1,"Nice Fantasy Yarn, But NOT the ""Dawn Treader""",8,11 December 2010,"C.S. Lewis' Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a series of haunting, evocative, but separate vignettes. This movie ties them together with the unifying theme of the return of the White Witch, and while I can see dramatic justification for the strategy the writers took, it's NOT The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. That said, it's still fun. The first few minutes are absolutely perfect and faithful to the book, but the liberties start flying thick and fast on the Lone Islands. In the book, Lord Berne is a noble on the island who helps Caspian stage a bold coup and overthrow the corrupt governor and slave traders. I can't think of any good reason not to follow that line in the film. Thereafter, events are merged and shuffled out of order. Lucy has matured from a cute child into an attractive young woman, and Laura Brent is ethereally beautiful as Ramandu's daughter (and Caspian's future wife in the book). The ship Dawn Treader is perfect and there are some breathtaking visual scenes showing the ship under sail. The finale, the return to Aslan's country, returns to the story line and captures the atmosphere wonderfully. The final scene concludes with the children returning to England and Eustace's mother calling that Jill Pole has come to visit, foreshadowing the Silver Chair.

90,djansen24,A big disappointment if you have read the book!,4,14 October 2013,"The third installment in the big budget Narnian films gives us a more or less solid film with impressive special effects wasted on a hackneyed script and mediocre acting. There are a couple of exceptions in the acting department. The boy playing Eustace hits his mark and the voice work for Reepicheep is handled well. The special effects are dazzling; merging reality with digital almost seamlessly. But my critique of this film is exactly the same as the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe film (I never saw Prince Caspian): The atmosphere is all wrong. Lighthearted whimsy is exchanged for somberness. A slow paced voyage is traded for a rapid fire adventure that moves so fast, we cannot enjoy the characters nor the moment. This isn't fantasy, it is a special effects reel. Added negatives include the actors, none of whom (Reepicheep excepted) capture any semblance of the royalty they attempt to portray. The actor playing Caspian is especially dimwitted in playing a king. He seems more like a befuddled commoner who learned a few royal gestures at school somewhere. At no time do you feel nor do his men feel like they are in the presence of a great king (which was the case in the book). The movie takes great liberties with the plot of the book, opting instead for a silly new plot about an evil mist which sucks away slaves in boats. This brings about a couple of new side characters (a father and daughter), neither of whom make much of an impression. What this movie series need is to RECAPTURE THE MOOD OF THE BOOKS and avoid throwing out the plot for a newer one. They can keep the special effects, but temper them with a story that takes its time and is as entranced with its surroundings as the passengers aboard the Dawn Treader were. Are the producers afraid to elevate the material up to the audience, instead of pandering down to short attention spans? It sure seems so. While taken on its own terms the movie is professionally handled, I guarantee the movie would have stuck in the minds of the audience more if greater pains were taken on a good script and good acting. As it is, you watch the film, leave, and then don't remember much afterward.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

Just like in the books. But at what price? Will Poulter may have a very characteristic face (which is a good thing), but is one of the worst child actors I've ever seen. On top of that Ben Barnes again plays Prince Caspian (who is almost unrecognizable compared to the previous film) but with no Spanish accent whatsoever. The story feels more like a Pirates of the Caribbean quest this time. With no success, even if the green and blue screens aren't as ugly as in Prince Caspian. These kind of kiddie movies are too predictable, moralistic (the Christian symbolism in this one isn't even remotely subtle anymore) and boring to entertain almost anyone. Or that's what I should hope. Reality proves me wrong. Unfortunately. Maybe that's why hideous films like Eragon, In the Name of the King and The Sorcerer's Apprentice find an audience. I can't speak for The Water Horse, The Seeker, The Spiderwick Chronicles and Inkeart (I haven't seen them), but something tells me it'll be more of the same (just like Seventh Son, which will be released next year).

Two of the Pevensies, (Peter and Susan) simply make cameo appearances since he is away at University and she is visiting America in the new film.This time the children are rescued by the infamous Dawn Trader ship, which is King Caspian's ship.All in all the effects were surprisingly good, (especially when Eustice becomes a sea dragon) and this time the film is in 3D, which should bring smiles from the little ones this Holiday season.

I was myself displeased with the movie. Its script is weak, its pacing is businesslike and empty and the lion Aslan is horribly CGI designed unlike the previous Narnia chapters where he was so wonderfully CGI designed. However, this third Narnian chapter does improve upon its predecessors on a few levels: it has more magic, more Narnian creatures and the main danger in the film is bigger, the challenges are higher and they're all striking. The character of Eustace makes for an impressive new-coming character entrance with powerful personalities. The movie includes other wholly amazing elements such as Lucy trying to be more beautiful than what she is and realizing the terrible consequences that could arise from such a thought, Eustace's thought- provoking character development, the unusual relationship between Eustace and Reepicheep at the end of the film, Reepicheep's dream of entering Aslan's Country, Aslan's country featured as big rising waves, the Sea Snake design and more still.

95,tripxyde,A Typical Voyage,4,8 December 2010,"While the first and second Narnia movies pretty much had a very war epic element; this new one is more of just plain adventure. The closest comparison to it may be the old (60s and 70s) Sinbad movies. If you are expecting this to catch up to how good the first two movies were; you may end up horribly dissatisfied. Perhaps if you were not in the mood, you could sense some degree of blandness in this movie. This felt like just another chapter to the Narnia series; a bridge episode, which one may choose to skip or ignore. On the other hand, many of my friends who actually read the book did confess that this was the more duller Narnia books, and it seems that nothing really great happens.At first, I thought the movie was just too simple, but I later realized that it lacked some details in the storyline aspect which could have spiced up the movie. The story just lazily jumps to the adventure with not much of a dramatic and character build-up. At least it sticks true to its intention as a children's adventure movie. It looks like it tries to inject in some wisdom and deeper themes, especially in scenes where Aslan is present, but I felt that these were not executed well enough to prove a point, and failed to be meaningful. I most certainly did not even get what the big deal is behind ""Aslan's country"".The two main characters Edmund and Lucy are all grown up now, and are most certainly making way for the new character, Eustace. This new main character is very unique because, for a main character, he doesn't look like the typical angel-face child actor. And for a kid, he certainly effectively acts like a grumpy old man, which is appropriately what the story requires him to act. His rants and complaints are amusing, and he does become a character that is fun to watch.Reepicheep, who was, in many ways, too little for the second movie, had a chance to shine in this movie. Despite the fact that he is a rodent, he is pretty much the bad-ass of the film. It was amusing that Lucy's character was supposed to be almost obsessively craving to be as beautiful as her sister Susan. But the actress who plays Lucy obviously looks more beautiful. I felt that the scene looked like a Drew Barrymore wanting to look like Alanis Morrisette.The 3D of the film was good enough to be satisfactory, but never impressive. The special effects were also satisfactory as well. Everything that you see in this movie is not as surprising as one would want it to be. As far as visuals would go, I'm sure female audiences would be ecstatic enough to see Prince Caspian. My female companion was herself having convulsions at every moment Caspian was on screen.I guess it's okay if you were to watch this with your children; this is good for being childishly fun and colorful. It's good enough to satisfy some craving for the fantasy of dragons and sea serpents. My expectations were actually too low, that's why it did not bother me. All in all, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a simple adventure movie. It's not exactly awful; it's just not impressive.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

Unlike the two previous parts, trikvele main attention is paid to the nature of human vices. Various religious and Christian motifs were traced in the first and second parts, but only a third have achieved so clearly defined role in an event that even a poorly disguised symbolism can be seen all the abundance of embedded ideas. That neither the scene, the obligatory reference to the seven deadly sins and the ten commandments of the Bible, regular tips Aslan, like the divine gaze from somewhere in the heavens and talk about his country, for the pure hearts and No Return ... Of fairy tale turned into a movie fantasy, and they in turn passed to the genre of religious parables, in which moral action and adventure are diluted with a modern twist.Of course, knowing all this, the blame of excessive morality tale - it excessive, family movie should carry the correct values and must be a cautionary tale, in addition to the ability to entertain. Benefit and entertain here really turns out, the film is very dynamic and incredibly beautiful! What is a house of invisibility or a sea full of white flowers! However the addition of 3D does not feel like would like very much here could demonstrate the technology at full volume and play with the audience, but the potential size was not revealed in all its glory video. Breathtaking scenes of battles yet expressive look and a very high quality set, so the replacement director is not too much there: everything remained the same breathtaking, as in ""Caspian,"". Just the story itself is not so much built on intrigue and action, much more on the linear characters' adventures. Trikvel was not so fairy-child, as the first movie, and not as fast-ekshenovym as a sequel.

What's happening really immerses the magical Narnia, captures the spirit of dragon flight, makes the heart beat in a spirit of adventure and carries through the entire running time of wondrous corners of this fantastic country. Moreover, unlike the previous two, the third movie was somehow kinder, more sublime and smooth on the measured plot of key points. It looks nice and in terms of special effects, and part of a story. Just to mention the brilliant qualities and positive aspects, we can not forget the colorful characters, played brilliantly cast. Looks great Ben Barnes as Caspian, as well despite the lack of a plot of older children of the family - in the film, they still flicker in some scenes, as well as Tilda Swinton in the guise of the White Witch at the same time there is full of diverse and very colorful secondary characters, which does not want to forget. And the best part - they just can not get lost, despite their numbers, even without seeing the first two stories. Because the film in principle independent, though the ways to move back and forth surprise every time their funky ideas.""Conqueror of dawn"" has successfully completed the trilogy of semeika Pevensey and gave a hint of ""Silver Chair"", in which the main character will be just a nasty fellow named Eustace and one of his girlfriend, but it already then, and this is another story. And now you can boldly go to the movies when there is a mood for a beautiful and edifying fairy-tale movie, go to the whole family or just send the children alone, a good time.

It takes some major liberties with the story, but retains many of the locations, challenges, and concepts from the book.I was about 10 minutes into the film when I had to drop all my thoughts about how the movie was differing from the book. After that I enjoyed the film more and was able to appreciate what they did with the conversion to film. It's unusual to have a story with no specific antagonist, just a grand quest for exploration & information. Makes you think of the frontier days when people went exploring just to see what's out there! If you didn't like Eustace, then kudos to Will Poulter for making that character as annoying as he is in the book. The friendship that formed between noble Reepicheep and awful Eustace is a touching example of what a little love & care can do to somebody's heart (that, and turning into a dragon..haha).But please, people... why should the fact this movie has Christian allegories be pointed out as a negative? This was based upon a Christian book and has some great messages to take to heart. If Charles Dawkins (famed Athiest) book ""God Delusion"" were made into a movie would people gripe about it's atheistic leanings? C'mon.Yes, I'm more inclined to the book... it's fantastic.

99,dtrani,Fairly good film; falls short for a Narnia film.,6,3 November 2020,"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a good film but simply doesn't cut it for me when comparing it to Andrew Adamson's previous two installments. I grew up watching these three films as a child and after watching them as an adult I can definitely see the contrast between Voyage of the Dawn Treader and the other two films.
One the big things that threw me off with this film was the overall mood and tone. I understand that even the book took the ""pirate-style"" approach, but this film just simply doesn't feel like Narnia. I want to say that it is partially due to the fact that Andrew Adamson did not direct the film. This is not to say that Michael Apted did a bad job but every director has its own flavor. Apted's flavor is much different than Adamson' thus feeling like a different type of movie. No matter what you do, if you hire a different director than you automatically give your film a different feeling.
I also felt it very strange of them to shoot everything in such a low shutter speed (or so it looked like it). Every form movement was so soft that it almost look fake. I heard rumors that it was a marketing scheme but have also heard that it might have been a Cinematographer's preference. Being a Cinematographer myself, I find it to be quite distracting at times and took me out of the film.
Now that most of the bad stuff are out of the way, lets talk about one of the highlights of this film...Will Poulter. Will Poulter soars above all other talent in this film. No matter what he does, his performance always seemed to satisfy me and make me smile. His presence automatically made a scene better and is a good example of good acting gone unnoticed at the time. His performance has definitely saved me from dropping this film rating any lower, as I enjoyed it very much.
It feels kind of wrong to critique a director based off the previous work of someone else. But unfortunately that is what had to happen here. With doing a sequel to a hit series comes the pressure and standards that go with it. So in the end The Voyage of the Dawn Treader seems to hit me at times in a good way but also at times in a bad way. This film works as a film alone (one maybe to watch with your family) but I definitely feel that it had the potenial to go above and beyond like its predecessors did, sometimes pushing rating boundaries as a children's film and getting even more creative.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
100,peterlane5,OK but not as good as the previous movies,6,10 December 2010,"Note: I did not finish the book because I found it to be boring unlike the previous books. But after seeing this I'll finish reading it. Plot: The two youngest Pevensie children return to Narnia with their annoying cousin. I didn't find it as good as the previous two but still good. Maybe I'm just getting older but I found some of the characters(or it could be the writing) to be very annoying more so than the previous movies. For example, the character Lucy is always stating the obvious. Now that it comes to mind, the characters have retained their most annoying traits from the first two movies. Lucy is still too curious for her own good and Edmund still whines about how he's never able to be the one in charge and how he wants to be the alpha male. About the 3D, I really didn't see the need for it save for a few scenes. Those are pretty much the only negative things that come to mind about the movie even though I'm sure it has some minor but insignificant flaws that be easily overlooked. I must give credit to Simon Pegg for taking over the role of Reepicheep after Eddie Izzard decided not to return. While not as funny as Izzard, Pegg still makes Reepicheep a good and lovable character. Will Poulter who plays Eustace, really hit the nail with the character. He just as annoying as he was in what I've read of the book. The movie isn't as action packed as ""Prince Caspian"" but I will say I was most impressed with the sea serpent battle. Another small problem i just remembered was the ending. Not to spoil anything but it's pretty much the exact same as ""Prince Caspian's"" ending.

I'm not quite sure what she found that was herky-jerky, or whatever. She just kept saying that it felt as if the movie were stopping and then starting, then doing that again and again. Perhaps the Director did that on purpose, in order to break the movie up into logical chapters or something. Like I said, I didn't notice that really.The things I liked were good visuals, good special effects, rather seamless acting of the actors with the special effects. It really was quite visually pleasing, and the plot elements dealt faithfully with the material of the book I thought. It's been awhile since I read the books, but I do recall the ""Changing of the guard"" so to speak with respect to the children who would continue to help Narnia against the forces of evil.I especially commend the whole aspect of the picture surrounding the character of Eustace. My wife and I agreed on that. The casting was superb for his character, and we were easily swayed by his change (no pun intended) in personality - even when we knew it was coming! The sea monster they created was very scary, and my wife was quite terrified when she saw it in all it's fantastic glory trying to tear the ship apart when Edmund confronts it at the climax. Magnificent! I think overall my feeling is that the effort and the ensuing production were of equal or better value than the Disney efforts on the first two films.

104,paperback_wizard,Voyage of the Dawn Treader,7,11 December 2010,"This weekend, it was a rare treat for me to watch and review ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"". The Chronicles of Narnia have always been a favorite of mine. It's a series comparable to all the great fantasy epics, both in classic and modern times, and ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" is my favorite chapter in the saga.A brief history, for those who aren't familiar with the series. Narnia is a mystical kingdom in a magical world that can only be reached when it is of the greatest need. It is watched over by Aslan the Lion, who comes and goes as he pleases but always chooses champions who can protect Narnia in the face of evil. In the first movie, two brothers and two sisters from our world are brought to Narnia to overthrow a terrifying Witch-Queen. In the second, they help a young prince named Caspian ascend to the throne that his uncle had usurped. While only adolescents in our world, in Narnia these four young men and women had become great heroes, kings and queens of legend.In this movie, the youngest two, Edmund and Lucy, travel to Narnia to find there is (apparently) no great need for their help. No wars are currently being fought, and King Caspian is now sailing on his ship, the Dawn Treader, to find seven Lords of Narnia whom his uncle had banished years earlier. Accompanying Edmund and Lucy, unwilling, is their cousin Eustace Scrubb, a thoroughly unpleasant boy who had never even read books about magical lands, let alone believed in them. His only delight in life seemed to be annoying others. Naturally, his attitude won him little friendship or sympathy when he found himself dragged along on a magical voyage in a land he'd teased his cousins for ""inventing"".The ship's company sails to the east, following the last known course of the seven Lords. Along their way, they battle slave traders, encounter an island full of invisible creatures and buildings, and deal with all sorts of fantastical creatures and enchantments. They find themselves tempted by their greatest desires and threatened by their worst fears, even as they strive to discover the fate of the missing Lords.The most valiant of the sailors is the brave Sir Reepicheep, a Mouse granted the gift of speech (and a new tail when his old was lost) by Aslan himself. Never one to back away from a fight, Reepicheep has a different motivation for embarking on this journey. As a young Mouse, he was told that he would some day travel to Aslan's Country in person. Delighted to see King Edmund and Queen Lucy once more, he finds it particularly difficult to tolerate Eustace. Reepicheep comments that, if Eustace hadn't been related to them by blood, he might have drawn his sword on the lad more than once (and from a Mouse who has faced dragons, it is no idle threat). Eventually, though, as Eustace is forced to face the reality of life in this strange and dangerous world, the noble Mouse becomes something of a guide to him, and even, oddly enough, a comfort from time to time.There's certainly enough adventure and danger to create an epic, and the emotional and personal trials that each character faces make for interesting moral and dramatic scenes. However, the main difference between the book and the movie is the nature of the voyage on which the crew of the Dawn Treader embarks. In the movie, more than simply finding the lost Lords, the crew is told by a magician that they must bring the swords of each Lord to Aslan's Table and lay them upon it. Doing so would mean the end to a terrible curse that plagues the isles of the east and threatens to spread to the shores of Narnia in time.Finding the seven swords grounds the movie more firmly in the epic fantasy genre, but it hardly seems necessary. Adding this element to the quest actually changed the dynamic of it. Certainly, it sharpened the focus of the dangers they faced, making the encounters with spirits and sea serpents seem less random; but it also called for changing the order of certain events, such as the order in which they visited the various islands. Also, it takes the focus off the characters themselves, even as the movie tries to bring their personal battles to the forefront, at times.These aren't major departures from the book. The same issues are addressed, and the storyline is very similar. In the end, not much was changed, especially not the messages delivered by the Great Lion. That's the important part. The books, written over half a century ago, endure in large part because of the author, C.S. Lewis, and the lessons he hoped to teach through his characters. Like the fables of old, The Chronicles of Narnia have their share of talking animals, but that's just window dressing. What's important is what you can learn from the story itself.(Originally appeared at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports/ )",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
105,jn1356-1,I thought it couldn't be done...,10,21 December 2010,"Narnia has been the site of mini-vacations I've taken for nearly 40 years. I never say ""I'm reading The Chronicles""; I say, ""I'm taking a mini-vacation in Narnia."" I do the same thing at least once a year in Middle Earth, and, every few years, in Thomas Covenant's The Land. I have read all seven of these books to my daughter. I know these books intimately.I told my daughter that I couldn't imagine a movie of The Dawn Treader. The book is not the unified novel the other six are. It is several stories rather loosely connected by the sea voyage. How do you make a movie out of that? By telling the story better than the original author, that's how! The movie begins with the younger brother Edmund trying to overcome his sense of inferiority to his brother, Narnia's High King Peter, by enlisting in the Army. It goes to the younger sister Lucy longingly looking at her face in the mirror, wishing she were as beautiful as her older sister Susan, well setting us up for what is to come. No such foreshadowing exists in the novel.At the Lone Islands, the mist that kidnaps unsold slaves is not from the novel at all, nor from anything I have read in C. S. Lewis. But it forms the framework for a unified story.From their first encounter, Reepicheep generously undertakes the correction and rehabilitation of Eustace, which is an unexpected side-effect of his Narnian adventures in the novel. In the novel, Reepicheep cares only for his honor, and only later shows kindness to Eustace.The Lone Islands adventures, the Island of the Dufflpuds, Ramandu's Island, the Dark Island are rearranged, condensed, reinterpreted, changed, transformed into a fine single story. The screenwriters have outdone C. S. Lewis as a storyteller in this case.I love C. S. Lewis. Sometimes, jokingly, I refer to him as St. Clive. But I don't think it's blasphemous to say somebody has found a way to tell his story better than he did. I am impressed, and I recommend this movie most highly.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
106,flyingsaucer,Deserves Respect,8,7 March 2011,"Have you ever wondered why all the Narnia movies instead of being well made and entertaining still receive lashings from critics and poor ratings? I wondered it always, and it seems like a conspiracy. The First was good, the second was better. This one is good too! What else can we expect from the makers? Should they make it look like 'Sin City'? :-) Well, they are trying their best, but are beaten to the ground by really poor reviews and collections. This movie(Lets talk about the movie now), is a long journey into the depths of Narnia, a voyage to root out the evil from the land. Only two folk from previous parts are there now, and a really frustrated lad in Eustace. Caspian is also present. And a fun ride awaits. Visuals are great, and engrossing. Do watch it, and don't bother about the critics.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
107,musanna-ahmed,"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader - a rough one, beautifully complete.",7,12 December 2010,"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is the third instalment in the book to film adaptation of C.S Lewis' novels. It took a different approach in production: a new director (Michael Apted replacing Andrew Adamson), a new distributor (20th Century Fox replacing Walt Disney Pictures), Simon Pegg replacing Bill Nighy who had replaced Eddie Izzard before dropping out as the voice of Reepicheep, and a 3D conversion for the film. The first two in the series were astounding films so my question was – do the changes in production prevent The Voyage of the Dawn Treader from being another great film?Continuing from Prince Caspian, at the end where Caspian was left the king of Narnia and the Pevensie siblings travelled back to their world, the movie begins with Lucy and Edmund living in England during a war and we are introduced to a new character. Their cousin Eustace – an annoying brat who despises the talks of Narnia that Lucy and Edmund have. Not so long into the film, Lucy observes a painting in the house of a ship on water and discusses to Edmund how it looks very ""Narnia"". Eustace loathes this idea and the three engage in an altercation until Lucy notices that the picture is animating, the water comes out slowly until it crashes out completely and drowns them into a new world. Not a new world at all when they quickly realise they are back in Narnia when they re-unite with their old friends Caspian and Reepicheep who help them up onto the ship that was seen in the painting. The ship is in the middle of nowhere and the quest for everyone on board is to travel across the sea in order to find Aslan's country, even it means travelling to the edges of the world. On their journey, they encounter many obstacles that the evil in Narnia is dominating with which include invisible beasts and warriors.Georgie Henley and Skander Keynes revisit their roles as Lucy and Edmund Pevensie carrying on their splendid acting. Also Ben Barnes returns as Caspian but this time a change in his accent can be noticed. Simon Pegg voicing Reepicheep gave the effect of a less mature mouse which Apted was looking for, and he sure made the right choice for his desired effect. The newly introduced Eustace is played by Will Poulter who if any readers have seen the 2008 British comedy Son of Rambow would know as Lee Carter. The whole personality of being an irritating person is well done by Poulter. And of course, the great lion Aslan is voiced again by Liam Neeson; the powerful voice of his deserved the role at the start and still does. Referring back to the beginning, the directing was spot on with the actors. A thumb up for Michael Apted.Technically speaking, the conversion to 3D was one of the best I've seen in a real world picture and certainly one of the best in its genre. Very rarely were there scenes which were just flat out 2D. The scenes which the camera was focusing on the characters on board of the Dawn Treader were particularly outstanding in 3D. Not to forget to mention, the nature in 3D was brilliantly done, from snow to water to the scenery. The process of 3D did slightly lower the contrast of the colours as with every film so watching it in 2D would give it a more beautifully coloured picture. Positives for both versions then. Moving onto the sound – sound effects of the invisible beasts had a marvellous effect in the movie and worked well with the positioning of the character as the camera was taking place in their point of view in the scenes they were involved in and the musical score was epic and well used during the many epic battle scenes in the film plus they helped create tension in the sequences leading to the battles and during them. The creations of the creatures were again amazingly created and that's not just talking about Aslan either. In my opinion, this film is superior to its predecessors. A lot faster paced than the previous two with the voyage of Dawn Treader almost immediately becoming the subject in the film from the start. The film is shorter than the previous two and maybe it was because of their lengths that they were slower than this. The majority of the second half of the film is very tense with electrifying scenes that I will not spoil in this review. Going back to the beginning with the question I asked, the changes in production increased the quality of this film and all was delivered well. One of the best fantasy films of the year and if you missed the new Harry Potter film or were disappointed that the creators of that film could not make it 3D in time, this is an excellent alternate. Recommended in either 2D or 3D, there is a benefit in both aforementioned in this review – 2D for the brighter colours, 3D for one of the best 3D fantasy pictures.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
108,Egzan,Fine children's film.,7,16 April 2021,But it really doesn't feel like a Narnia movie. It lacks something.,The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
109,KrazzyDJ,Visually Outstanding. A decent movie overall,6,4 December 2010,"It's been an overdose of fantasy for me in the last few days I guess. First, in anticipation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I, I watched all the previous ones at a stretch. For this, I had to do a similar thing. Else how would it make any sense ??? The Narnia series, it seems, is shaping up to be the replacement of the Harry Potter series. We all know that Harry Potter is gonna be done with by the next year. That will leave us with the Narnia series, and with four more movies to go, I suppose that's gonna last a long while till another fantasy movie series pops up.The movie begins with the Pevensies being transported to Narnia ""least when they expected"". This time, they have their cousin Eustace with them who takes some time to accepting the Narnian world filled with talking creatures and other such wonders. He reacts similar to how the Pevensies did when they first saw Narnia, only he's more scared than surprised. Since they've landed in Narnia unexpectedly, there has to be a reason for it. And there is, and a supposedly good one - one which will not only test their battling skills what with dragons, serpents and storms on the way, but also bring them face to face with their inner demons and fears.As far as the similarity of the movie's plot with the book goes, I frankly admit to having no idea regarding that. I've viewed the movie as a movie, as a sequel to the first two and as such, won't be able to comment on how well the movie follows the plot of the book. On the surface of it however, the plot is fairly basic but filled with too many characters to confuse someone who isn't familiar with the books. All the cast members perform well though the star of the show has to be Reepicheep the mouse - he is so endearing that you'd often find yourself rooting for him. And then again there's Aslan the Lion who, in my opinion, is the best (CGI) wonder ever created in the Narnian movie universe. His mere presence in a frame makes it stand out. He appears responsible, wise, calm and like a father figure to the Pevensies and others - the character is so greatly conceived that his mere sight makes you respect him. He truly has the aura of a king and rightfully deserves to be one. And Liam Neeson does a fabulous job of voicing him as do the animators on making him appear life-like. And when the soft and soothing background score plays in the background during his presence, you're bound to feel a lump in your throat. You'll definitely hear a child scream ""Aslan"" in the movie theater when he first arrives.Visually, the film is simply outstanding. Such is the richness of the effects that it makes me wonder how on earth can the film be made on a budget of ""just"" $140 million. I mean, the amount of visual effects present in the film and the quality of each shot is simply brilliant - from the dragon to the serpent to the wide shots of The Dawn Treader to the Islands to the waves to Reepicheep the mouse and finally, the great Aslan. Lighting, it seems has improved to the point that it is difficult to tell what is CGI and what is real. The main musical themes have been recycled from the past films which is a great thing since those themes were simply heart touching, especially Aslan's. The set design is also good although as mentioned, it is hard to distinguish between real and digital sets.Like many movies with excessive VFX, the movie tends to give a slightly more focus to the effects (maybe because it is a children centric film). Although made for children, adults shouldn't find this a reason to stay away from the movie. The movie might tend to get a bit boring at times. And the biggest drawback of the movie is the 3-D which, quite simply, is as good as not there. By all means, you'd be better saving some bucks and watching the movie in 2-D; it might as well also save you a headache. As a matter of fact, the commercial shown during my movie screening had better 3-D that that found in this movie. Despite its drawbacks, it is a good movie and can make for a good viewing with / without family. If not for anything else, I recommend it, For Aslan !!!Score: 6.5 / 10",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

111,Bunty-at-IMDB,The Voyage of the Dawn Treader - An Average Affair,6,21 March 2011,"The Chronicles of Narnia film series, after the first great installment, has tumbled. Disney backed out after the failure of Prince Caspian at the box-office, while Fox is backing up the series. Trying to regain its strength back, the new film in the series, Voyage of the Dawn Treader is plain average.With some good first 10 minutes, Voyage of the Dawn treader spends lot of time in monotonous search of ""seven swords"". The middle of the film is very slow paced, with some very boring CG spectacles. The film gains its momentum near the last 30 minutes or so, with a good action sequence with a sea-serpent. Apart from pacing problems, the film suffers from ""uninteresting"" script. The film suffers from lack of suspense or mystery and dull dialogs.Michael Apted, however, tried his level best to lift off the film with some few nice touches here and there. The best thing happened to the film is Will Poulter who played Eustace brilliantly as nasty and self-centered kid. The CGI character Reepicheep is also a delight to watch.The CGI of the film looked unfinished, especially the Dragon Eustace, which felt very ""plastic"". May be this is due to slashing of budget by the studio, but still, we have examples of ""District 9"", bad CGI is obviously intolerable.The film won't win any new fans, nor it will please any other audience except its target. Filled with Christian analogues and uninspiring 3D spectacles, Voyage of the Dawn Treader disappoints a bit, but it is still a big leap from Prince Caspian. 6/10",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

There were no stupid battles (trying to make the film like LOTR).Reepicheep was brilliant, and I particularly liked Eustace, the Dawn Treader itself, the dragon, the picture/sea and the bit at the end about Aslan's country.Didn't like the insertion of the witch, who I actually thought was completely wrong in the first film, and very badly played by an insipid-looking actress.Also thought the acknowledgment to Pauline Baynes at the end was a good idea - what a pity she did not live to see her work so recognized.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
113,mooviefan-891-879574,the weakest of the series,7,29 December 2010,Even when the first two installments of Narnia were no masterpieces somehow Disney was able to produce entertaining films ( maybe not with the visual quality of Lord of the rings)but on their own merits they were interesting enough to watch. When the first trailer of the voyage... came out it seemed that this was going to be very different from the previous two ( and not necessarily in a good way) Today my suspicions were confirmed and I have to say that this is by far the less exciting movie of the Narnia series. The pace is very slow for a fantasy/action movie and at many points the plot seems to go nowhere there's at least half an hour when absolutely nothing happens and when it starts to get interesting guess what the movie is over. On top of that the CGI was very poor for my taste it was nothing close to spectacular.

What may work on paper doesn't always play well on the screen.I admit that I haven't read the books. But I've seem all three films, and Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a great, wonderfully fun adventure fantasy film. The characters are consistent with the first two films, and the plot is - for a fantasy film - coherent and believable. I liked it much more than the second film, Prince Caspian, which I felt was the weakest in the series.Be prepared for some very intense action that may scare the wee ones.

Once again, there are many differences between the movie and the book, but if you take them both and examine them separately, you'll see the wonders and magic of the movie. Honestly, this book was my least favorite out of all of themthe book seemed a little cheesy, and it didn't have hardly any action in themand you know how I love action! The writers took the book, and created their own interpretation of what happened on their journeyand they made it more entertaining to be honestbut they did not take out the message of the book. I think that they did the book justice in that aspect.Little things did change, probably because this movie is no longer a Disney movie, and Fox picked it up to finish the series. Prince Caspian (same actor) does not have a silly Spanish accent anymoreinstead he has an English accentwhich to be honest was sexier than the Spanish one. The movie did seem to steal a line (or scene) from Ghostbustersbut don't worry, there is no Stay puff Marshmallow Man in this movie. Overall, you need to see this movie while it's in 3D!

117,monolith94,Reverse alchemy: gold to lead,4,15 December 2014,"I don't want to get too hyperbolic in my criticisms of this film. I'm tempted to call it a desecration, but to do that I'd have to successfully argue that the source material was sacred. I enjoyed the book that this film was rather loosely based on, but I'm not interested in taking time here to assert the quality of C.S. Lewis' work.However, whether the original book was great, good, or bad, it was certainly better than this. At least, to my taste. I was ready and willing to enjoy this film, so ready, so willing. Having grown up on the seacoast, I have done a fair bit of sailing myself: I really enjoy tales of the sea. I have stood watch at the bow of a ship all through the night; I was young, and struggled to stay awake as the clipper gently rose and fell. The waves themselves had a gentle swaying motion, it seemed, not unlike the rocking of a cradle. Of course, had I fallen asleep, I could have easily slipped overboard and drowned. All of this was vividly in my mind as I looked up at the stars and focused my mind as best as I could to make it through the hours of my shift.The struggle was not against a dark lord, or an evil witch, but against my own frailty or childish whims. It was time for me to grow up and meet a challenge that was unusual but not impossible. I think that the Voyage of the Dawn Treader is about a similar struggle, not against a ""big bad"" but rather is a more ambiguous, abstract struggle. It is a tale of exploration, both of the world around us and of our internal psyche. However, what forces were behind the creation of this product were of limited vision. In their desire to make something profitable and safe, they essentially took a winding, exploratory narrative, and grafted it onto the only sort of story they really understand: bad guys versus good guys. The essential centerpiece of the story previously was the transformation of Eustace, this has been sidelined into it becoming a story of bravery overcoming dark, nebulous ""evil"" forces of an island essentially invented from whole cloth for this new story. It's an aping of a Harry Potter, where the characters grow through overcoming an external antagonist, but I doubt Rowling would approve.Grotesquely, at times the search for the seven swords comes to resemble a world of warcraft-like fetch quest.The irony is that I believe much of what fails in this adaptation stems from an honest desire to make an adaptation which Lewis would be proud of. The adapters hope and believe that Lewis would be understanding of the changes as ""necessary"" in order to make the story able to be told in a cinematic way.However, cinema as a medium was perfectly capable of telling a compelling story closer to C.S. Lewis' vision. Some of the greatest motion picture history do not have an obvious antagonist. For example, Andrei Rublev is a compelling narrative which follows the life of its main character, exploring ideas while moving from small enclosed story to other stories. OK, OK, maybe a little obscure and high-brow, I grant you. Let us not forget that C.S. Lewis was an oxford professor, an expert on such highbrow things as Paradise Lost and medieval literature. But let us grant that the forces behind this adaptation don't have the patience or the ability to use something as sophisticated as Andrei Rublev or Paradise Lost as a model. (One wonders if they were to adapt Paradise Lost if they'd make it into a movie about Adam having to find the twelve blessed tchotckies in order to vanquish the evil Satan or something like that)Well, there are plenty of examples of more audience-friendly stories which also eschew the rote good-guy, bad-guy plot. Take for example Kiki's Delivery Service, an excellent family film which gains its narrative thrust from the conflict not of a young girl on a quest to save the realm, but from a young girl going out into the world to find her place within it, to start her own business, and to overcome her own doubts of self-worth and periods of internal darkness.I can understand the temptation to want to create an enemy to have your characters face against. Even Pixar, as great as they are, have trouble creating narratives which don't depend on the crutch of employing an easy-to-hate villain. However, Pixar aren't trying to adapt a piece of literary history, and adapting a work of a sincere person such as this demands, I think, a little more reverence.Take a piece of art off the wall, and polish it and polish it: what are you left with? Perhaps a pleasant blur, but lacking the meaning and complexity of what you started with. This essentially corporate polishing has gone beyond just the story, other aspects of the film are also effected. The boat itself is a bit too clean, to pristine to feel real. The magic manor Lucy explores also suffers from this. They could have drawn on inspiration from magic houses in cinema history, such as Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast, or the magic interiors from The Blood of A Poet. The end result is that the experience feels less magical, less enrapturing, a cost of making the experience theoretically more palatable to a wider audience.Also, laziness, ignorance, or lack of talent, taste, or intelligence could be responsible. As a humble critic, I shrink from assuming that this was precisely the problem, but certainly one wonders if this was not the case.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
118,Muskox53,"Better than the first two Narnia films, but...",5,20 July 2013,"It might have been more prudent for the filmmakers to have eschewed Narnia altogether, since these stories don't lend themselves to this medium terribly well. Still, this may be the best of the three so far...but that's not saying much. The story outlines are there, and all the main episodes of the book survive, but reordered and refocused, to mixed effect. Whereas the book is a picaresque series of loosely connected adventures in which the principal conflicts are all matters of morality and character, the film opts for a central villain and sword-fights--with themes and images borrowed from other more successful fantasy films. Harry Potter had Voldemort, so they move Lewis's Dark Isle of Dreams to the climax and transform it into the base of a wholly new, dementor-like green mist that envelops people, as well as showing up whenever one of the heroes is contemplating less-than-honorable behaviour. Its principal threat to the heroes, however, is not nightmares, but instead a Sea Serpent, which is to be thwarted somehow by gathering the seven silver swords of the missing Narnian lords (something like Rings of Power...). This is all a bit silly, and turns a spiritual tale into something like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, with the lesson that difficulties are best resolved by slugging things out. Struggles with conscience don't seem to have much of a role to play in between battles. Thus, the principal character development in the book, the transformation of Eustace from an insufferable prig into a decent guy, is delayed considerably, and the film's attention to this part of the story wanes and waxes disconcertingly. It may have been a good idea, cinematically, to allow him to remain as a dragon to help battle the Sea Serpent and even to help find the seventh sword...but the quietness of his transformation in the book is much more effective.The acting is generally acceptable, if not brilliant or even particularly memorable. Georgie Henley has grown up nicely, and is starting to look like a young Drew Barrymore. (Lucy's fear of being plainer than her sister Susan does seem ludicrous, however, given her maturing beauty and the fact that the latter looks a thoroughly conventional débutante.) Skandar Keynes, as Edmund Pevensie, is also fine, though out-shown regularly by Will Poulter, as Eustace. Liam Neeson and Simon Pegg do creditable voice-over work for their important CG characters. The script, not surprisingly, is wildly uneven. All the best lines are Lewis's. Expositions and rewrites designed to facilitate the narrative changes are uniformly dull and flat. Many small changes seem ill-considered--for example, why would anyone bring a minotaur (cattle on boats?!) on an ocean voyage? What's the point of having a second girl stowaway on board? And so on. I wish they'd found a way to leave more of Lewis in, and not meddle so much with the story...and leave out at least half of the battle scenes!I haven't seen (and have no intention of seeing) the 3D version, but can't imagine that it adds much.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

Maybe it's because it was a little out of the mould of the rest. Anyway this film worked; it had a good story and the whole thing hung together well. I know they changed the story somewhat, but they maintained the spirit of the story: it is, in my opinion, a reverential and very acceptable version.I can't help feeling that this was make or break for this franchise. 'The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe' was okay. A little shallow and overly effects and action driven, but it wasn't bad - but then it wasn't exactly memorable, either.Then we had 'Prince Caspian' perhaps my least favourite of the books, but still the book was streets better than the film, which completely failed to convey the magic of the book. All one can say is that the director had gone for a 'Return of the King'-light approach and completely failed to bring it off.So I had pretty low expectations when I set out to watch this film. As it happens I could have set them pretty high and still found them low of the mark. As said above, this film was very well done and certainly did not let the audience down. Here was magic; here was action; here was pure entertainment.Watch it if you like a good story, this will suffice and if you want a bit more than just a good story this still will suffice.A standard has been set now, so lets hope it's maintained for the next, which I am guessing will be 'The Silver Chair'",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

Unfortunately, this was not the case in this version.The problem was that it strayed too far from the book with unnecessary tangents and subplots. There are added characters and additional story lines not in the book that detracted from the movie. The movie did not flow well at all and at times, seem forced. I was also disappointed that the ending was changed from what was in the book.This is a OK film too see. The special effects are good. The actor playing Eustace Scrubb did an excellent job.

122,RockBiter,Move Over for Cousin Eustace,8,28 December 2010,"As a lover of the Narnia books, I, of course, eagerly awaited the third installment of the film series. Yes, I had heard that Disney had opted out of the promotion of the film and yes, Andrew Adamson had had to take a pass on this one but I had resolved to let my own judgment of the final product rest on what I actually saw on screen - which was a pleasant surprise.Michael Apted presents the viewer with a somehow fresh, new Narnia. As far as the story-line goes, this has a lot to do with the fact that we are now exploring Narnia's Eastern Sea, going out, in fact, possibly to the very edge of that world where Aslan Himself is said to dwell. New-comer, the irascible and cantankerous Cousin Eustace Scrubb (Will Poulter) is an unwitting and unwilling companion of Edmund (Keynes) and Lucy (Henley)as they are swept up through a magical painting and smack-dab in the midst of the Eastern Sea where they are hauled on board the Dawn Treader and begin their next adventure. Caspian (Barnes), now king, has embarked on a solemn mission to find the lost 7 lords of Narnia who had been loyal to his father and who were exiled by Miraz. In the process, they are forced to deal with a mysterious evil entity which has been terrorizing the islands in the East.As a sea adventure, therefore, this film stands nicely apart from the first two. I would like to say that the new setting and the script pushes the stars of the film to expand their abilities and talents but, unfortunately, one of the weaknesses of the film is that they are not and do not. Keynes turns in perhaps the weakest performance and even Henley, whose Lucy is confronting a powerful issue of jealousy and self-loathing as she leaves behind her girlhood and begins to become a young woman, is stretched only slightly. I do not know if this is because there is no sharp, definable climax to the film or if the underlying conflicts in the lives of the characters do not mesh with the overall development of the plot.Having mentioned the weaknesses of the film there are many strengths. Barnes grows in his handling of Caspian. He becomes more mature and shows a greater range of emotions but the greatest performance is that of Will Poulter. He defines Eustace crisply and masterfully from the outset and brings a whole new energy to the story. With him, we do not miss Peter and Susan or look back at all to what has gone before and been left behind, we look forward rather to whatever new adventures he is going to lead us on. We get the sense that he is the next one to lead us further into Narnia after the Pevensies depart. In a very real sense this film is HIS story, in fact. I was touched by the relationship that was developed between Eustace and Reepicheep in this story. At the end, when Eustace learns a whole new set of values and a new outlook on life and after Reepicheep helps him do so, it is wonderfully fitting to have the brave mouse finally lay down his sword and enter into Aslan's Land at the end. I actually had a tear as Reepicheep heads into his 'rest'.Memorable scenes: - the duel between Eustace and Reepicheep - the Book of Incantations - Lucy's transformation into her beautiful older sister in the mirror on the ship and then her vision of her family without her or the knowledge of Narnia - (THIS was a gem and truly spine-tingling as which of us would not want to see ourselves transform into what we have always dreamt of becoming - only to realize that in the process we destroy our own life and the lives of those we love - wow)",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
123,LinJason,Eustace and Reepicheep took centre stage instead,5,5 December 2010,"Possibly the least satisfying film of the three in the series as the story (or direction rather) goes into fantasy (illogical) mode, leaving most of the adults questioning its purpose. Although intending to complete the series with an extra feature by entering into the third dimension, the film didn't seem to have much need for it. Less the muddling direction and lacklustre 3D effects, the film scores on other aesthetic aspects.Affairs get hasty in returning Edmund and Lucy back to Narnia with their cousin Eustace (resembling the pronunciation of 'useless') this time. You know right from the start that either a spectacular Narnian adventure lies ahead or sloppy screen writing gets in the way of proper plot development.Unfortunately, it's the later.It's interesting to hear what Edmund actually said in the film after the party has been picked up by Prince Caspian and his vessel in the open sea. ""If there's no wars to fight, then why are we here in Narnia?"". I cannot agree more in wholesome with Edmund as he couldn't have better summarised the entire film.It is true that there is no longer the epic battle scenes that have inspired the previous two installments, but it is also true that you don't need battlefield action in order to make a good story. What Director Michael Apted (of 'The World Is Not Enough' fame) did was to get them shuttling between random islands in quick succession as they hurry around to find seven ancient swords of old Narnian Lords in order to undo the evil that has plagued the seas.I didn't just express the film's synopsis as that is all there is to the entire film, which is why I'm really puzzled that the screenwriters did not develop more details within the major plot pieces. Adding on to the mountain of woes, several plot elements go unelaborated to leave the audience (especially those who have yet to read C.S. Lewis' novel that the film is based upon) in serious disarray.There are nevertheless some delights to watch for, such as the courageous talking mouse Reepicheep who seems to have grown wiser and less hysterical as in the previous film. Albeit a tiny creature, he's a positive mind who never fails to inspire others around even during the darkest moments. This makes him my favourite character who earns my respect as Reepicheep definitely makes a stellar role model for children.Eustace adds most of the comic relief and spices up the silver screen with his friendship forged with Reepicheep during the adventure. With a quirky demeanour of an intelligent scholar who is often cynic and snobbish, Poulter pulls his role off incredibly well with his own flavour.In all, this makes a proper closure to The Chronicles of Narnia series in an unsatisfying fashion that nevertheless boasts great visual effects and fantasy adventure fare for the boring weekends.Not a must to catch this in 3D, according to my humble opinion.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
124,PYRiAH,It felt like a voyage alright...,5,12 December 2010,"Just as C.S. Lewis' books dropped in popularity after ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"", I believe the film adaptations might be doing the same. Granted I enjoyed ""Prince Caspian"" way more than I enjoyed ""The Lion and the Witch"" (probably because there was a huge battle at the end), but I think Fox made a mistake when it changed directors from ""Prince Caspian"" to ""Dawn Treader"". I don't know why Fox switched directors, but I do know that I would have much rather seen Andrew Adamson's (Shrek 1 & 2) version of ""Dawn Treader"" than seeing the one I saw directed by Michael Apted (""The World is not Enough"").

125,stitch-99,"Overall, I'd say it was just...okay.",6,12 December 2010,"Unlike a lot of people, I actually enjoyed Prince Caspian. However, I was less satisfied with this entry. Before you get your pitchforks and torches, allow me to explain.First, let me explain what worked with this movie. Before it came out, I concluded that the only way that it could work is if the filmmakers focused on the character development, since that's what holds the story together and prevents it from becoming a series of unrelated events. Thankfully, this is exactly what they did. All of the main characters go through a wonderfully portrayed arc that really drags one into their experiences. Almost all of the actors did a very good job.Now, let me say what I did not like. Before I get into this, let me clarify: I used to be the kind of fan that can't stand to see changes to the source material. Now my philosophy is that changes are okay as long as the story is good. On that note, this movie strayed quite far from the book. Most of it was simple chronology. However, the biggest change (and the only one that irritated me) was making the Dark Island (where all of one's worst nightmares come true) into essentially the antagonist of the film. Nearly all of the aforementioned character development was forcibly orchestrated to be either caused by or in reaction to the work of the Dark Island. Mind you, I would actually be okay with this idea if that Island was simply the place where all of the characters' dark sides manifested themselves. But no, it had to be coercing their inner demons all along. Also, this change caused a reinterpretation of the main mission which was to find the seven Narnian Lords. Apparently, these Lords were seeking a way to destroy the Evil and they had magic swords from Aslan. As much as I tried to buy this subplot, I couldn't see it as anything else but ripping off The Omen. It also changed the seven Lords into simply means to an end, which irked me. There was also a small girl and her father who joined the Dawn Treader crew to find the girl's mother who had been taken by the Evil. While this added ""cute points,"" which some might care for, it mainly just gave us two more characters on which to focus. This was especially difficult given that they weren't given names throughout the movie. I spent the entire thing thinking of them as ""Little Girl"" and ""Little Girl's Father.""For one final qualm, the introduction of the seven swords created a few plot holes. It is mentioned how the swords were given to Narnia by Aslan during the Golden Age. The Golden Age was when Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy were ruling, so why didn't they know about these swords? Additionally, how did the swords make the transition from Old Narnian hands into those of seven Telmarine lords in the midst of a war? Why would these lords who don't believe in Aslan hold the swords in such high regard as to try to use them to defeat the Evil? None of these ideas are explained. While possible answers could be given, it is the job of the movie to convey necessary information such as this, whether explicitly or implicitly.*tired sigh* Anyway, the film was a pretty good follow-up to the previous installments, though the shift in production made itself apparent. I don't know if anyone else will share my sentiments about the Dark Island's enhanced role, but this is simply my opinion.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
126,groovybabe1992,one word: disappointed,3,13 December 2010,"I thought this film was going to be good as i liked the first and second films. But to be honest, after seeing it, i was really disappointed.And i didn't think that it was really good in 3D. It made it worse I think. 2D would have been better for me as 3D films give me a headache afterwards.I thought that their were too much sword fighting. I also didn't get the plot which made me really bored. But there were a bit that i liked as i loved the guy who played the cousin. He was funny. Sorry Narnia fans, i thought this film was poor.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
127,thetimegivenus,Best Movie I've Seen All Year,10,29 December 2010,"I'm back now. I've been to Narnia, experienced all its wonders, and now, like Edmund and Lucy, I've returned home. It has been an amazing adventure each time, but this time, with The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, it has been extra special.The Story: Edmund and Lucy Pevensie are stuck at the home of their obnoxious cousin Eustace Clarence Scrubb with no sign of relief in sight. The only comfort they have is an old picture hung in the spare bedroom. It's a painting of a very Narnian looking ship sailing through the sea. On one particularly difficult day, the picture comes alive and the three children find themselves transported into Narnia.While Edmund and Lucy are overjoyed at being back in Narnia, they find it rather odd that the whole country is at peace and there does not seem to be any great dangers threatening Narnia, as there have been the last two times they were called to Narnia.But all is not as it seems, as they learn soon after landing at the Lone Islands.The Good: This is another one of those wonderful films which is so full of wholesome elements that I'm not really sure where to start here.On a purely technical note the film was very well done. The digital characters were not up to par with The Lord of the Rings, but they were not far behind! The acting was quite good and the whole production was just a joy to watch.The film is packed full of edifying lessons and themes. One of the major themes of the film is resisting temptation. Each of the main characters in the film has to ""defeat the darkness inside before they can destroy the evil outside"". One other lesson the film teaches is the need to be content with who we are rather than wishing we were someone else.Other themes include friendship, loyalty, looking out for and protecting others, and courage. The film also touches upon our inability to change ourselves, and our need for help from someone more powerful than us. Also mentioned is the need for faith, or belief, for ""without belief, we have nothing!"" Lastly, in the very touching ending Lucy asks Aslan if they will know him in their world. Aslan replies that in their world he is known by a different name and that the whole reason they were brought to Narnia for a little while was so they could know him forever in their world.While I will speak more in depth about this later, the film does contain a little magic and I think it was handled quite well. Most of the magic central to the story is clearly controlled by and caused by Aslan himself. What little other magic is used is either evil, or for the most part, frowned on by Alsan.The Bad: While this isn't necessarily bad, there are some tense scenes and a few potentially scary creatures. Just a warning for those with young children.There are really only two problems with this film and, in my opinion, they are pretty minor when compared to all the positive elements. First, there is one improper use of the Lord's name. While this certainly doesn't excuse its presence, I will say it is very brief and it is said in a low voice, making it barely noticeable.The other problem with the film is magic. Once again, it is handled pretty well in the Narnia series, but not quite as well as I would like. When Lucy is captured by the Dufflepuds she enters the magician's mansion and reads a couple of spells out of his magic book, one of which makes the Dufflepuds visible again. Aslan does appear displeased with Lucy dabbling with magic, but she does recite a couple of spells. Also, the magician clearly has magical powers and uses them to create a map to show the travelers where to sail next.Fortunately these scenes are very short and the use of magic is not a major subject of the film.Conclusion: I'd have to say this is the best film I've seen all year, ""period, exclamation mark!""",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
128,DaveModer,Same issue...as with the other episodes,1,13 December 2010,"I had the chance to watch this movie. For free. That is why I'm not upset, otherwise I would be. So I started to watch the movie.. and got bored, really bored. My friends around me were bored as well. In my opinion the main problem is with this movie are the characters. I do not care about any of them! I think the casting director made a big mistake, because none of the characters are likable, or someone you would remember after a while. The only exception is Prince Caspian, he is an OK actor.In this new one, there was this guy, I already forgot his name. With the weird eyebrow, always complaining, the pain in the a** (he looked like a Vulcan). His voice didn't match his face. Was it re-dubbed? I felt like it would be so good to punch him in the face.After 30 minutes I got asleep. Really :). I opened my eyes, and I realized I missed some minutes. Probably 5, or more. My mouth got dry from the popcorn, so I asked around. Do we want to watch this bore any longer, or leave and have a beer? We left. :P Avoid!",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
129,pizzazzman2000,Captivating and very entertaining!,10,21 December 2010,"We could combine a wonderful mix of fantasy, illusions, alluding to what we've seen in fairy tales, and what we used to be told when we were young by our grannies to get us to sleep..... But none....I mean nothing, which the common man could conjure up, would be a parallel to this 4 part series. Sure there have been many fiction works on the big screen which live up to the expectations of the masses, and The Chronicles of Narnia seems to go beyond that. For one, C.S.Lewis seems, in a bid to accommodate the various facets of imagination and fantasy, has spread the various faces of them across four parts. Sure, imagination is truly potent, for imagination has no reins to slow it down, or pull it to a standstill. And true, fantasy has a bazillion ways of finding its way into the outside, and I can find many authors, movie directors, and the like, try to exploit its true potential.But the true potential of fantasy is hard to fathom, for I can see, that whenever we come across a work which seems to have finally reached the edge, another truly eye-opening image of fantasy springs up, waiting in the wings, to take us further to another realm and spatter our minds with the instant awe.I digress, but back to the chorus: C.S. Lewis takes us into another dimension of illusions, spiced up with his own fantasy. Following these three parts released so far, the story unfolds slowly, slow enough so that our imaginations are given a breath of fresh air. His imagination deviates from the imagination which comes to our minds naturally, for if we see all three parts, it's amazing how in each part, the pevensie children find a different way back to the magical land of Narnia.Another interesting perspective is how in the first part (The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe), we see an equal mix of good and bad protagonists. Equal, in terms of the combined strengths of good and evil, or to make things clearer, we have the four ""good"" children, against the powerful ""evil"" white witch. And although we always expect the good to prevail, for those of us who already have not read the book, we are left wondering how much derring-do it'll take to really bring the Witch down. And the talking animals, which seems to go along with what we ourselves imagined when we were small. And sure, we all imagined princes, kings, queens, which Lewis nicely covered in the first part.In the second part, Lewis focuses on a different but related plot. The talking animals, evil witches, and so on, seem to have faded into the background. Or we can say that Lewis has already given them their share of importance, and seems to want to incorporate a different ""less magic-intensive"" storyline, while still adding a touch of fantasy which he gave in his first part. Sure, there are talking animals, and magic, but not so much this time.This third part, we can clearly see, was born to handover the reins from the last of the Pevensie children, to Eustace. Along that note, we get to see a laudable performance of a new protagonist, who enters as a stuck-up brat-cum-cousin, and as the third part unrolls, he gets plummeted into full focus with his dragon role, which accelerates his role to paladin. Sure, we get to have a performance which solidly engraved itself into our memories, and paved the way for our next hero, which will become evident in another couple of years with the next installment, which will hopefully set the cash registers ringing. The performance of Eustace smacks of the ""I'm-the-next-in-line"", and keeps alive the captivating spell which was woven and cast by the first part. Or better still, he blows away the dust which was slowly descending on the plot. For with the same Pevensies, and Caspian fighting evil, things would ideally have taken a very predictable pattern, if Eustace had not come along. Hats off to him!But as a whole, as the story gradually unfolds, on a sad note, as it passes from one phase to another, or, to be more precise, from one plot to another, we get the distinct feeling of the plot becoming drier, similar to the phenomenon of trade winds which, are moisture-laden when they hit the shore, but gradually lose their potential as they travel across land, until there is nothing left in them when they reach the desert. Still, as I watched it, and even reminisced the very first part, I could not but help feel relieved that the long wait ( after the second part) was finally over. The Chronicles of Narnia is one series which, no matter what, manages to slip you under its captivating spell, for it is all about the evocative transformational power of fantasy and imagination. The same way we sit with a rubix cube for hours, and get absorbed with its many faces, fantasy is able to absorb us into it. I personally believe that the entire series so far, just takes advantage of the charged-up-with-imagination mind of the audience,and then just takes it into another realm. That is its true power. And now let's wait another couple of years for ""The Silver Chair"".",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
130,gawayne7,Best of the three,10,2 July 2018,"This is by far my favourite of the trilogy- I found Prince Caspian a little disappointing- it lacked magic-but this has magic aplenty and more excitement than the previous two put together- also not so obsessed with war and battles as the others. Just a great fantasy with a heart- which is magical even for someone older like me. As Roald Dahl says ""those who don't believe in magic will never find it."" This film emphasised more the beauty of Narnia rather than showing it is a war torn country.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
131,msloane1,The Wonder and Magic of Narnia has Returned,9,7 January 2015,"Let me say right up front that I am an atheist and a secularist and as such I don't care about any religious undertones or allegory this series may contain. My review of this movie is based on the book to movie transition and how good it is as a fantasy film.The Voyage of the Dawn Treader was a return to what Narnia is supposed to be. Narnia is nowhere near as good as Harry Potter or the Middle Earth trilogies. But the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe was a good movie in its own way. Prince Caspian was more disappointing. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader restored the magic and wonder of Narnia. Prince Caspian placed a very heavy emphasis on battle scenes and was darker and more serious than is appropriate for the Narnia series. Narnia is supposed to be full of wonder and magic. The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe had it, Prince Caspian lost it, and the Voyage of the Dawn Treader restores it. First of all, while the Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a less literal translation of the book to the movie, it is still very faithful to the book. What will be very noticeable to viewers who are familiar with the book is that the order events occur in in the movie is different from the book and in some cases noticeably so. This is a non issue to me. The fact remains that most of the important events from the book are in the movie. Furthermore, a change in order is actually good for the movie. It works far better cinematically to have Eustace's dragon form occur later in the story. Also, the book is largely episodic so altering the order of events doesn't really alter the meaning or significance of any event. At the end of the day it's still about the quest for the lost lords and the for Aslan's Country. Now we have the issue of content not in the book being added to the film. While I do not agree with the director that a ""thrust"" needed to be added as I think the quest for the lost lords and Aslan's Country is a perfectly good thrust, I do like the addition of laying the Seven Swords at Aslan's Table. This addition is completely consistent with the original story as the Seven Swords plot line fits right alongside the Seven Lords plot line. On the other hand I certainly could have done without that retarded green mist subplot. The green mist subplot? No. Just. No. The acting/casting was mixed to positive as is typical for this series. Liam Neeson is an awesome voice of Aslan and Georgie always gives a splendid performance as Lucy. On the other hand I've never cared for Edmund in the movies and Ben's Caspian is good but not great. Obviously the main newbie here is Will as Eustace and he's fantastic. He captures the annoying and unlikable nature of the character brilliantly. The Eustace of this movie felt far more real than the Edmund of LLW. The pacing is excellent. This movie gets going quickly and never has a dull moment. But the best part of this movie is the special effects and visuals. This movie is beautifully shot and absolutely breathtaking. This movie has very vivid colors, very realistic looking settings and items, and just about perfect production quality. The special effects and visuals in this movie are a wonder to behold. This is also easily the most family friendly/ child friendly movie in the Narnia series so it can be enjoyed by just about anyone. All in all The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a quality movie that restores the wonder and magic of Narnia. Faithfulness to the book: 8 out of 10. Casting/acting: 7 out of 10. Pacing: 10 out of 10. Special effects and visuals: 10 out of 10. Overall: 9 out of 10.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

133,brillig-2,Just a short note on 3D,5,20 December 2010,"I won't cover the story. That is done nicely by others. This review is specific to the 3D aspect of the film. It is full of distracting artifacts. For example, scenes on board the ship where you can see the far deck through subject matter on the near deck are placed inaccurately. Borders around objects are messed up. Faces even have incorrect perspective sometimes, especially when there are rapid transitions between camera angles where two different focal lengths were apparently used. The list goes on.The main point is that the 3D not only did not add to the film, it is a major distraction. I've seen worse, but if you have the choice between 2D and 3D, don't see the 2D version just to save money, see it to avoid the post-processing artifacts.In my opinion, movies that have been converted to 3D should not be marketed as 3D movies.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
134,billnich-1,An Intelligent story neglected in favor of action-adventure (possible spoiler),1,10 December 2010,"On the whole it was enjoyable, but it was yet another example of Hollywood bastardization of the original story in order to make an ""exciting"" rather than intelligent film. CS Lewis' works are more intelligent than exciting, while not neglecting the latter.To begin with, one cannot deny (although many try) the Christian themes in the stories. As such, Voyage of the Dawn Treader is the most mystical of the Chronicles of Narnia; a Voyage into the realm of the divine. Each island visited shows a progression toward that and the temptations that try to divert them from that encounter. In the end, some are granted, others are denied, some go only part way, all for reasons that are implied throughout the story.The film tries, but is not successful to the point of neglecting the intelligence in favor of an adventure. While the Islands of the story are pretty much covered, the order is rearranged in favor of the film-makers' efforts to add a few twists or turns of their own. While I admire the spectacle, I am disappointed with the overall treatment of the series (something the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings films have been more successful in accomplishing.All in all, glad I saw it, but not a film I am planning to include in my DVD/Blue Ray collection.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
135,matrixpolaris,Boring and rubbish.,3,12 August 2016,"Boring. Just, boring. From one of the most promising franchises of the 21st century, comes the underwhelming 3rd installment, that lacks the fun and imaginativeness of the first one, and the tension and epic battles of the second. It's dull, confusing, boring and disappointing, and while the CGI and the acting is quite good, you can't stop feeling disappointed. Because it's Narnia, doesn't mean it's good. Some scenes are really cheesy, such as when Lucy is carried by invisible people with only one leg, and when a sea serpent appears, just because that was the first thing that came to his mind. I mean, seriously. You can see it's not Andrew Adamson, and that change of director sort of ruined it. And also, it's sad to see that while Edward and the rest of them are fighting with a sea serpent, Lucy just lounges on the bottom deck. Definitely not worth watching. You'll probably fall asleep by the middle chapter. Terrible. Thanks a lot, Michael Apted. (Sarcasm)",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
136,BenignPillows,Underrated,7,15 September 2016,"Finally got around to watching this after Netflix just released it. I always heard it was the worst of the three, but I was pleasantly surprised! Of course, that might be because it doesn't take much to be better than the BBC version I grew up with - and that's coming from someone who loved ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" from back in 1988. Richard Dempsey is still my definitive King Peter and Sophie Wilcox my Lucy. It's when making the sequels that BBC just seemed to stop caring, and turned out one awful series after another (don't even get me started on The Silver Chair, the new movie is bound to seem like a masterpiece in comparison).There's also the fact that the book Voyage of the Dawn Treader, which this is based on, is somewhat flawed, especially in dramatic structure. It's very episodic, like many small stories instead of one unified, which isn't good for a movie. Something had to be done, and I actually think they solved it well for this movie, by moving some of the events around, and by inventing a sort of consistent leitmotif; the evil mist. While a poorly developed ""villain"", it created a better focus and raised the stakes from the beginning. I also think the themes were better developed, for example Lucy being tempted by vanity. ""When you grow up, you should be just like YOU"" is actually a pretty important message to little girls. And Caspian seemed more like a human being than the cardboard cut-out from the BBC version (and maybe the book). Further, compared to said version, the special effects were of course infinitely better, and the script was also much better, though, as with this whole franchise, I would have liked the language less modernized.The most important thing, the acting, was generally good. Skandar Keynes needs to be mentioned - he has this weird staring look, like he's very nearsighted or something - but he's a great actor. He gave the movie emotional resonance in a way that Georgie Henley couldn't. Sorry, but despite Lucy's vanity arc, I felt Henley was mostly there to look cute and smile in wonder over the magic. That worked when she was little, but in this movie her lack of range and depth showed. Will Poulter, though. What a talent! The guy's a comedic genius! He *was* Eustace, acting not only with his face, but with his whole body. He gave Eustace his own, very geeky way of moving and walking. I do wish they had made him less of a comic relief and more outright mean, so that there would have been more to redeem (like, actually stealing water when there was lack of it), but I like that they moved the sea-serpent to the end battle and let Eustace The Dragon redeem himself through the role he played there. It's too bad Will Poulter is too old to play Eustace now, but I hope he keeps acting. In conclusion - maybe not a great movie, but definitely a decent one, watchable for the whole family.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
137,skg009,Don't waste your time,3,5 December 2010,"I had very high expectations with this one, I was looking for visual effects in full flow, dragon fights and lots more, in the end I felt disappointing. After I read the reviews by others, I guess I m in the minority list but I have not intention of holding on to my feelings.The movie is about a voyage and they could have done that in no time, there was little exploration of human feelings and there was no attempt for it. The visual effects was not something we have not seen. It went flat.The book is much better than the movie because it explores the visual side of what cannot be seen in the book. This one fails flat.Sorry Narnia fans, I loved the earlier versions much better.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
138,lastdomino,Didn't have to be the book word for word to make a better film,4,1 January 2011,"Dawn Treader is my favorite of the Narnia books. There are aspects in the original story that make it a beautiful story. The story has been rewritten completely to make it a dark and violent story - granted, with a bit more action. There are few enough stories in the world that could have rated an honest G rating and I think Dawn Treader is capable of that. The story of the Dawn Treader is a journey, but in order to keep the action, the beauty in the story is decreased.For someone who has not read the story, I suppose it would be a good story with lots of action and a clear cut storyline. However, because I am a fan, the story is horribly rewritten to a PG rated story - the journey is forced to have a purpose it was not written with. I don't think that was necessary.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
139,Pixie-Belle,The best one yet!,9,4 December 2010,Once again we are draw into the world of Narnia as Edmund and Lucy along with their cousin Eustace to help King Caspian find seven Lords banished from Narnia by his uncle.This third film in the Narnia series is a great improvement on the last and by far the best yet. Sadly with Prince Caspian it appears the film makers threw the book out the window and made up their own story where as this one sticks a lot closer to the book I am pleased to say although there are naturally a few twists and changes to the story. Seeing the film in 3D adds little as clearly it was post converted.Ben Barnes looks a lot more comfortable in the skin of Caspian this time especially having dropped the Spanish accent. Will Poulter as Eustace is a clear stand out too but being a kids film none of the cast really get a chance to show off their acting talents with any long monologues or scenes. Reepicheep's story is also well done.The film is good fun and there are some great action pieces especially with the sea serpent. The special effects are well done too. A great family flick for the holidays.I must also note a wonderful touch over the closing credits by using images from the book. A source of reference I wish had been used in the last film. Overall a good job by Fox having now taking over the series from Disney. Now if you can just go back and re-make Prince Caspian for me please?,The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
140,jc-89,Nearly much better,5,1 January 2011,"Its hard to make a good Narnia movie. For a start, the genre is too heavily overlaid with LOTR and Harry Potter. The books tread carefully (successfully for me at the right age) between scary and cutesy. The moral message is blatant and the policy of losing one or two characters each book and adding new ones works well in a series but doesn't play so well to a movie franchise.Dawn Treader is modelled as a series - its Lewis' take on Gulliver's Travels. So cutting it into a feature will always take some doing.The movie plays fast and lose with the plot, but a good movie should and I don't think they did too bad a job. The overarching concept of the book is the redemption of Eustace and they don't lose that. Missing out the torture of Eustace' self-flaying to restore his humanity was cowardly, but we still get a sense of the boy's anguish and his wonder that people cared about him.I couldn't work out why, but it looks more like TV than a movie. Something to do with the shot-list I think - too few big pans a lot of close-ups.Where the movie falls down in in the plot and continuity details, and in the lack of a personified villain. Now the book lacks the latter too, but it doesn't have a final battle. There are too many ""why would they do that?"" and ""how did he get there?"" moments. A little attention to detail could have fixed these - perhaps some of them were lost on the cutting room floor.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
141,nikowanamate,i don't know what to think,6,19 December 2010,"this trailer for this movie certainly had me jazzed to see it. it felt as if it was a movie trying to break from the other two, but having seen this one, the other two seem to be completely different from this one. i don't know whether it was the change of director or change of the big studios to fox 2000, but the film lacked in a lot of places.i felt destroyed because i didn't emotionally connect with all the film's character. the only outstanding performance was from the mouse and the little we had of aslan, other than that the acting tendered to be stale and predictable, which i found cliché and boring. the dialogue also made them look extremely bad, it was cheesy to the point of embarrassment. even i would i have done a better job to guide this film from one point to the next, not tell a story that should about 40 minutes in 10 minutes, as i felt were many of the small story lines in the movie.despite the fantastic visual effects, they weren't helped by the lack of performances from the main actors, who should have done a better job ... ala... the last two narnia films.however, on a more positive note, the ending perhaps revive the narnia spirit we have all come to love and respect. it's beautifully filmed, and aslan's entrance is done majestically. the battle at the end is done so convincingly, but the way it ends...i just don't know what to say.i don't know if i would recommend this film...but if you go to see it...have an open mind, because the film certainly had some...but small good moments.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
142,NCHaskew,A Voyage Done Right,8,18 December 2010,"I must admit, walking into the theater to see this movie, I had great fear for the Narnian film universe. I had heard multiple tales of how the film strayed too far from the book and essentially destroyed the future this series might have had in store. My fears were quickly allayed. For one thing, the movie omits very little from the book, only rearranging certain events and adding extra bits here and there. All of these changes are merely tools to keep the story flowing smoothly, which is effectively done. The film expands on the idea of a Nightmare Island and turns it into this ever-present corrupting mist. This helps builds intensity and gives the story more purpose then the book's more laid-back plot of searching for seven Telmarine lords, which the movie includes as well. The movie also helps bring more relevance to the seven lords by adding the plot that their seven swords are the key to bringing down this corrupting mist. Also in an effort to keep the story flowing, they swapped Coriakin's Island and Dragon Island so that Coriakin came first in order to inform the crew of the Dawn Treader (and the audience) of the importance of the seven swords. I'm all for giving a film a basic problem-solution plot. There's nothing wrong with it, as long as it's done well. The movie also keeps Eustace as a dragon much longer and gives him a battle scene with a sea serpent, instead of the dull, repair labor the book gives him. While the urge to argue that this was merely for the purpose of giving the film an effects-laden battle (and I'm sure that was part of it), the film also takes advantage of this longer dragon story to give a better transition from Eustace the annoyingly rude little bugger to Eustace the honorable young man who ultimately inherits the Pevensie's Narnian journeys in later stories. It also helps better portray his growing relationship with Reechipeep, expanding the book's basic idea of him being his tutor to becoming a better man. Also a praise to the film is a return to Aslan's Christ-like symbolism, which felt strangely absent or hollow in Prince Caspian. Director Michael Apted (who also directed Amazing Grace, another great Christian-themed film) did a suburb job of recapturing this. Don't get me wrong; his actual presence in the film is still significantly shorter than The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, but it's more relevant and his closing lines revealing to Lucy and Edmund that he has ""another name"" on Earth brought tears to my eyes as it was verbatim to the book's reference to Christianity. And of course, anything Liam Neeson says is amazing. Aslan's changing Eustace back to a boy is a little different from the book, but I understand how it would have been awkward to have in the film, so no complaints...you'll have to read the book to know what I'm talking about...it's just to odd a thing to describe. I also applaud Will Poulter's performance as Eustace Scrubb, who, quite frankly, steals the spotlight from Lucy and Edmund with his wonderful change to being another Earth-originating adventurer of Narnia. I am definitely eager to see him continue this role in Silver Chair and, hoping against hope, The Last Battle. But I'm getting ahead of myself. My one complaint of the movie is that they never really specify WHY and HOW this ""Dark Mist"" is so powerful, though they say several times that it will ""soon be unstoppable."" This didn't bother me TOO much, but we all have our things to be OCD about, so it may be a deal-breaker to some...but only if they're EXTREMELY picky about detail. In any case, this movie is by far better than Prince Caspian and a welcome addition to the Narnian film series. Fingers crossed for Silver Chair!",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
143,dnlgg,"Perfect tone, perfect balance, terrific film that deserves to be seen series that deserves to continue",9,12 December 2010,"This film was terrific. A little family friendly for me in some places but well acted and exciting none the less. The tone is perfect; it gets the chemistry and camaraderie of its characters in many ways better than the previous two movies while building on what has already been established. It introduces new characters perfectly particularly Eustace. Some things are changed in the adaptation but they all work well and are in keeping of the spirit of the novel. The allegory is gentle but quite obviously there and neither is it obnoxiously rammed down your throat nor watered down and gutted. There are some cheesy lines but they are so well delivered you hardly notice. The dialogue is a bit thin in some places; that area of the script needed more attention and a little more crackle. The characters are finally really the characters from the book and Reepicheep, Lucy and Eustace are so perfect you would be ready to forgive if even should the film go horribly awry. Fortunately it does not although it is not necessarily perfect. All in all this is an excellent continuation of the Narnia series ( a little short though; i suspect there is a longer better cut out there somewhere) with beautiful cinematography, none of the awful cheap pop out gimmicks that plague 3d features. i saw it in 2d and it flowed wonderfully. It would really be a shame should this be the last Chronicle of Narnia adapted in this series, I suspect that The Silver Chair may be the one where the series hits its stride. Don't believe all the reviews that say lackluster or out of gas, it just isn't true. This series deserves to be seen through to the end, not just on the strength of its source material but on what it has achieved for itself.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
144,benjweil,Dreadful film,2,21 March 2011,"Who would have thought that the film versions of The Chronicles of Narnia could get even worse? Or that the acting could deteriorate still further? Well, I would have, for one. I only watched this because it was showing on my flight.Ben Barnes was particularly wooden as Caspian while Georgie Whose-It has lost whatever appeal she had in the first film, though to be fair this may well be because her lines are all so predictable, along with much gasping and pointing. And Will Poulter as Eustace is a complete caricature, boring to watch, and not at all believable.The problem with this film is that is simply goes from one action scene to the next, with little or no character development or meaningful down-time. I couldn't care less what happens to the main characters, nor did the plot make any sense. The fact that the acting in this film makes the young Harry Potter protagonists seem quite adept says a lot. But I don't think that is solely due to the actors; the direction of ""Dawn Treader"" is excruciatingly formulaic and soulless.Do yourself a favor and stick to the books.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

The GFX is also mediocre and not even comparable with the last 2 movies.And to top it all, the guy with the camera must've been either high on meth or didn't sleep in a month because it kept wobbling and going in all directions like he was recording some show on Discovery.I could've said more, but to be honest...it's a waste of time ...this is what you get for 150mil ?! what a joke.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

Somewhat like Pirates of the Caribbean in regards to the adventures! The plot may have differentiated from the original book, but most films based on novels do!

We all understand this and accept it: There just isn't space even in a two hour movie to include everything which happens in an entire novel.But this travesty wanders so far away from the source material, introducing an unneeded quest for magical swords and a pointless ""big bad"" invented from whole cloth which adds nothing to the story but merely takes time away from the relevant.Add in the mysterious change of Reepicheep's voice - what happened? Was Eddie Izzard unavailable for this one? - and the lamentable shift from intelligence to brute force as a solution to, for example, the Lone Islands slavery problem and what we have here is a dreadful movie which completely misses the point of the book.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

150,desalvo_j,Very Good Film; Worth the ticket price,9,22 December 2010,This was a very good film with some slow spots but I would have to say that the story flowed very well and inspired emotion which is the mark of a good film with a well written script. Kudos got out to the director and all who put this film together I would say that it lives up to C. S. Lewis original concept and vision Well Done This film was definitely better that the film that preceded it if you are one of those touchy feely types this film can make you cry as the ending was very sad indeed and was hard for me to hold tears back; which is the reason I have to say that this is a very good film. It does inspire emotional feelings me and my wife were pleased; I would like to have seen the 3D version and may do so before this film runs its course at the theaters.,The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
151,terephiel,Absolutely spectacular!,10,18 December 2010,"I saw this film earlier this week and was undoubtedly impressed, just as I'd knew I'd be. The last two Narnia films were great, and this one is no different. The acting is fantastic, especially how newcomer Will Poulter perfectly portrays the character of Eustace Scrubb. The special effects are beautiful, and the storyline is as suspenseful and thrilling as that of the original novel. The ending was quite saddening, seeing as several main characters will no longer be seen except in possible future cameos, but then again, that's how the novel goes. I must disagree with the comments that say this is horrible in 3-D. It really serves to enhance the experience, and I felt as if I was actually in the story itself. Of course, you don't *have* to see it in 3-D if you don't want to or can't afford it; however, if you can, I'd definitely recommend it. Overall, I think ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" is by far the best film that has come out this year. I hope it makes Disney realize what they lost by having given up on the franchise. It's wonderful to see it knock the abortion known as ""Tangled"" down in the box office, since Disney ruined it with the title, character, and storyline changes.I'm sure if C. S. Lewis were alive today, he'd be very proud of this and the other two Narnia films. It's a definite must-see for all ages and I'm hopeful that adaptations of the novels will continue.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
152,trooperjac,Fantastic Locations,7,11 April 2011,The Lion the Witch & the Wardrobe remains the best of the Narnia movies so far. That story is a rightful classic and fondly remembered by kids of all ages. The movie version was fabulous and a lot of that was down to the obvious chemistry between the young actors playing the Pevensies.Dawn Treader suffers slightly when relying on the two younger siblings for it's emotional center despite Georgie & Skandar turning in good performances. The film doesn't quite feel the same without Susan & Peter but I know it would have been a travesty for them to appear in this film. I found Will Poulter's acting a touch overblown even for a fantasy movie but these are minor points as he come's good in the end.All in all I enjoyed the movie very much. A proper boy's own adventure (& girl's) with great photography and fabulous fantasy locations. The ending was pretty moving with Lucy & Edmund saying goodbye to Narnia for the last time.Seems they are filming The Magician's Nephew next which looks cool.,The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
153,sniffle_wiffle,"It definitely has it's faults, but I still liked this sweet and thrilling adventure.",7,15 December 2010,"Well back to Narnia once again folks, and I must admit it has been a while. I saw 'The Lion the Witch and the Wardbrobe' back in Christmas 2005, and I was pleasantly surprised with it. I missed out on 'Prince Caspian' in 2008, probably because I was busy watching 'The Dark Knight', and I think judging from the box office so was the rest of he world. So how does 'Voyage of the Dawn Treader' fare? Well it certainly has notable problems which I will delve into in a minute, but overall I enjoyed this quick and upbeat fantasy adventure, which isn't at all gloomy and realistic like many films these days.What I love about the Narnia tales, is that they have very simple plots, which only take about 5 minutes to explain. In this installment Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keynes) and his sister Lucy (the delightful Georgie Henley), are staying in Cambridge with their highly irritating cousin Eustace Scrubb(a cinematic turn by Will Poulter). The two of them are fed up and miss Narnia, and it isn't long before a Narnia like painting in their room suddenly comes alive and sucks them and Eustace back into Narnia right next to the great ship - the Dawn Treader in the middle of the sea. King Caspian (Ben Barnes)happens to be running the ship, and immediately has his former friends on board. So literally ten minutes in the film we are already off on the journey of the Dawn Treader, so to those you hate slow movies, you will love this one.The heroes and the annoying Eustace who no-one likes, go to many places and encounter danger at every corner, as well as magic and mystery. It's a rip-roaring adventure that doesn't let up for a minute (literally!), and the special effects are impressive even if they aren't the best in the world. The basic plot is, the heroes are searching for the seven lords of Narnia who have mysteriously disappeared, and an evil island that produces evil green mist that corrupts the minds of the good, is lurking everywhere.So it's a great fantasy adventure that anyone can understand and enjoy, so what are its problems? Well the film is a bit too fast paced. There is hardly any build up to the return of Narnia, it's literally ten minutes in the film and we are already on board the Dawn Treader. 1 hour and 50 minutes isn't really a suitable clocking time for a fantasy epic in my opinion, with the emotional farewell at the end feeling a little hollow because I felt like I haven't been on a very long journey with these characters. I also felt the adventures on the various islands the crew visit throughout the film could have been expanded quite a bit.A few of the performances felt a little wooden, with Skandar Keynes being a bit of a letdown as Edmund, and a couple of the lines of Eustace felt that they should have been funny but ultimately weren't, but I blame the script not the actor who is actually pretty impressive for most of the film. Eustace's change from unlikable little boy to a hero at the end is well done, and his budding friendship with the talking mouse Reepicheep (voiced by Simon Pegg) was pretty sweet. Georgie Henley is once again a real charmer as Lucy, and Ben Barnes was surprisingly good as Caspian. Fans of Aslan may be disappointed to know that he only pops up a couple of times, and the White Witch despite the misleading posters is only a vision of Edmunds'. There aren't many epic battles like in the previous two films, but the film does climax with a battle with a giant sea serphent that was thrilling and spectacular.So all in all, this is a fun fantasy treat but not much more. It's quick pace and short length, plus with some wooden acting here and there, left me feeling the film had potential to be much more. Nevertheless, if you're looking for a bit of escapism from the real world then I urge you to see this romping adventure. Unlike many films these days it is uplifting and lighthearted, and just gets on with it. Enjoy!",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

The 3-D version does not rely on gimmicks and spraying stuff at the screen as do other 3-D films, but uses the 3-D to create real depth and dimension and texture in the scenes. It gives them more color and brightness. The special effects were also top notch, amazing and excellent, and the acting is excellent also. The movie moved along quite nicely and had a great amount of humor, including one of the funniest lines I have ever heard in a film, from Reepicheep, a character who is truly wonderful!

Nothing of the magic of the first Narnia movie is left in this piece of garbage. It was clear to see that the budget for this third movie was less the the others. The money was clearly not spend on the writing or the cheap looking effects. So I'm guessing the exotic locations and terrible cliché music took up most of the budget.One big positive point in this movie is the wonderful acting by Will Poulter as the horrible nephew Eustace. He is certainly not afraid to give it all. I see a big acting career ahead of him.,The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

I tried watching it years later, just recently yesterday, and it turns out I still hate it. There's something about the four ""new"" main casts that don't click with the audience. The story was subpar and religiously overbearing. And finally, the film lacked the canonicity. The only good thing about it was the animation, I guess.

Voyage of The Dawn Treader opens in war time Britain, allowing a slight glimpse into the spirit of the country's youth. The adventure begins in the home setting of the Pevensie's cousin, who is well portrayed as a constantly complaining brat of a kid and adds comedic spice to the tale. With just enough surprises and well done special effects, I found this episode to be a delightful Christmas Day movie.Another review suggests that the Lucy and Edmund characters seem somewhat 'weak' in this episode. I found the characters to be 'spot on', given that they are somewhat older now and more mature.

Plus a superb debut for Will Poulter who steals every scene he is in, especially the final one with Reepicheep. But I have been wondering, why do I not like this film as much as I should ? The reason is the same as it always is for films like this - poor screenplay and acting. My score is as high as 6 because the other elements are so good and make up for it to an extent.Skandar Keynes does not make a good leading actor. He always played a good foil to William Moseley's High King Peter, but in a lead role it doesn't really work and he looks distinctly self conscious. The extensive alterations to the book - especially the omission of large parts of the bitter conflict over slavery - made no sense to me. In the first film,the producers added extra scenes and drama but kept all the key aspects of the story. The same approach would have worked on Dawn Treader, but they botched it.Watching the DVD commentary it also appears that all was not well with Director throwing Producer off the set. This contrasts with the deep emotional connection which Andrew Adamson was able to achieve with his cast.So note to Walden and Fox.

162,ancoraa,"Decent, but Kind of Disappointing",6,18 January 2014,"The Chronicles of Narnia have always held a special place in my heart, and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader was one of my favorites out of the whole series. So of course I was giddy with excitement when it came out in theaters and I went to go see it.Good Aspects: Will Poulter nailed Eustace's character, and his portrayal in the movie was well done overall. His performance was enjoyable and the best in the whole movie. Most of the scenery and effects were gorgeous and showed a nice variety in land, too, even if they weren't always the best. I also really like that they retained the message of the book. C.S. Lewis based this book off of the Christian life, and I could definitely see them bringing it out in this movie instead of skirting around it, which I'm very glad about. We also get a bit of character development for Lucy, which I liked since, while I do love her character, has always seemed like a bit of a static character to me. The event that caused it happened in the book, but they harped on it a bit more in the movie and I like how they did it. Negative Aspects: Unfortunately, somebody decided to mess up the plot. They added in a plot of Caspian trying to find the swords that belonged to the seven lords, which didn't happen in the book, he was just trying to find them to figure out what had become of them. They also got some of the islands out of order and added a green mist that wasn't in the book. I get that they were trying to add some type of villain into the story, but some changes just shouldn't be made, as the book was perfectly fine without it. It was a serious departure from the structure and story of the book altogether. Then they had to bring back the White Witch again, which had me rolling my eyes.The allegory messages are generally well done, and the ending scene is very touching. It could have been a beautiful movie, but such major changes led to me being somewhat disappointed.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
163,denisvn93-1,"The return of magic is real, just not bearing the same quality (2-D)",6,20 December 2010,"Are you sitting comfortably? Then I shall beginOnce upon a time, a band named Narnia is exiled from Disneyland as a member of theirs, Prince Caspian, doesn't cast enough spells to impress the king there. So, they travel far and wide, until one day, the emperor from Fox provides them shelter. Right on time for his 75th birthday and fascinated with the band's achievements, he gifts our friends with the Dawn Treader, a ship that has been purposed to traverse uncharted waters that, as legend has it, have more magic than 10 David Copperfields can conjure. While we're all happy because this third installment is returning to the bright side, this adventure does not have the quality that the Mickey treatment delivered. ACTING: The voyage is strictly for the Pevensie children, Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and not Susan and Peter (yes, the trailers lieagain). While these young actors' physicality has grown considerably, their acting skills improve marginally. I expected a tad more complexity in their performances, more emotions to be displayed at certain points i.e. when Ed is angry, he *sounds* angry but does not *look* like he is due to lack of facial variation. However, it is from this only little change that makes them the Edmund and Lucy that made such a memorable impression on the audience the first time. The same can be said for Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes). Eustace (Will Poulter) perhaps outshines everybody else, executing perfect comedic timing and delivering his lines professionally. Every time he speaks, the audience has great laughs. As for the voices, Liam Neeson *is* Aslan but imo, Simon Pegg is trying to imitate Eddie Izzard so he doesn't sweep me off my feet like I have expected (and like the first time in Prince Caspian). Coriakin and the Blue Star are bland and pretty much expendable, yet without them the magic will be lacking. In general, mediocre. Period. Exclamation mark.SCRIPT: There are so many production changes made that I was beginning to delete this franchise out of my head. Thankfully, Fox still has the decency to keep the original scriptwriters so the dialog retains the Narnia atmosphere that the film's devotees have been familiarized with. As per usual, it's one event after the other, with a nice set up and a clean finale. Light but captivating. Great work!DIRECTION: Michael Apted is a pro with pacing in his action scenes. See how thrilling the chase sequences are 007: TWINE? Well, he brings the same flavor to the Narnia universe by giving us what has got to be one of the finest set pieces in 2010: the sea serpent battle. There's this classic creepy build-up, things go haywire and it's done; when it's done, stage 2 begins in an even more freaky awesome way. However, all the goodness is in the third act, while the first two are a drag (unlike the first Narnia). On a whole, Michael distinguishes himself from Andrew Adamson by making things eerier (in some truly memorable sequences) and lets the film runs faster so that the film doesn't feel too childish. Not too grim but not too light. MUSIC: David Arnold for Narnia = no, no, no, no and no. I'm not saying that he's a bad composer (the Bond series couldn't get its longevity if not for his scores) but why the hell didn't they keep Harry Gregson- Williams? David has a lot of gap to fill as the score only comes to life in bursts i.e. snowing around Lucy and not through the whole film like how Disney does it. As for the music itself: it's boring.CINEMATOGRAPHY: Like the music, Dante Spinotti is another no no. I thought that the photography is magnificent in the last two Narnias with mainly large-scale tracking and static shots. Dante takes a different approach with shoulder cam and mostly close tracking shots, making the images really un-fantasy and more of a documentary (and the blur that the digital camera produces is ARRGHHH). However, when the framing is done right and thankfully there's plenty - the shots are astounding to behold e.g. the Flower Sea and many wide shots of the ship against the ocean/sky. Again, not a bad person, just a wrong choice.VISUAL EFFECTS: This is the saving grace for the whole film. I dare say that the CGI, for 90% of the film, is even better than the two Disney's Narnias. Characters are more detailed i.e. Reepichep and Aslan at close- ups and the mist effects are outstanding. The remaining 10%? Some characters look a bit off and don't blend in to the environment well, case in point: the mermaids and the one-foot thingies. For sure, the magic is back and the audience will return. However, the overall effect may just be disappointing as so many elements that have made Narnia a recognizable name at the movies today are replaced. You could go see it, but remember there are plenty of other cinematic escapes to take for Christmas. From Vietnam, Denisvn93-1",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
164,alerasoul,Good... but Bad.,6,13 December 2010,"About a year and a half ago, I was thrilled about this film. I kept that excitement with me for all that time, then saw the film, and I was disappointed.I'm a book-reader for the Narnia series. However, I do realize that film's primary purpose is to entertain. If a movie is based on a book, T.V. show, comic book, video game, etc., I rate the movie according to how entertained I was, not necessarily on how close the movie stayed true to the source material. With ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader"", I wasn't really entertained.Now, the book is my favorite of the whole series. This film seemed WAY too fast-paced to me. Nothing that was done was satisfying. The introduction to earth was far too short, and didn't let the viewer take in enough. The jump from earth to Narnia was too quick. Then there were other things like the first sword fight looking like it was filmed with a television show camera. Caspian's accent has apparently changed from Telmarine (Spaniard-like) to full-throttle proper British over the course of just three years. Hard to not notice.But the thing that made me cringe the most was the acting. The script was fine. The acting was horrifically bad. It's like Apted told Georgie (Lucy) and Skandar (Edmund) to deliver their lines in the most corny way possible, with the least amount of feeling or realism. Their jobs in the first and second films were superb (I thought). In this film it was like they'd gotten worse. And it wasn't just the Pevensies, it was Eustace. OH, THE HORROR! It was like he was in a school play. His condescending, annoying obnoxiousness was acted out like a newcomer to the film world. His way of speaking was just trite and completely unrealistic. Absolutely atrocious acting from him; I'd say he was the worst actor in this of the lot. Not to mention Simon Pegg as Reepicheep. Ever wondered what face would appear next to the dictionary definition of ""melodramatic""? Now you've got it. I was cringing in my chair.The story was still quite interesting, however. And there's a certain line that Aslan says in the end of the book that's vital to include in the film. Happily, it was. But that still wasn't enough to get me to really love the film. The climax just didn't feel satisfying enough to me. Then there was a plot element in the novel between Caspian and Ramandu's daughter 'the star' (a love interest) that I was looking forward to, but was never included.The overall experience made me give this film a '6' because the story was still intriguing. The acting and fast pace, however, were mostly what put me off. Maybe it's just me. You might like the film. You might not pick up any of the faults that I found, and love the movie just like my sister did (she thought it was wonderfully cute and amazing). I'm not saying I don't recommend the movie. I'm just saying if you're a movie buff like me (I've watched over a thousand films), if you love the Narnia series, and if you have a good eye for performance, you might not enjoy this movie. I really can't judge others for liking the movie, because it wasn't technically a bad film. In my opinion, however, it wasn't that good a film, either.6/10 stars.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
165,henriette-holm,Fine movie but....,5,24 January 2021,"In it self a good enough movie, but in my opinion it has made to many big changes to the source material.

The focus becomes more on action than the story, which is a shame.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
166,todd1928,Pleasantly Surprising,7,7 December 2010,"I must admit that when I first walked into the cinema I didn't have the greatest hopes for a series of films that have been tremendously overshadowed by the Harry Potter phenomenon. While I did watch the first two Narnia films my attention wasn't all there so I didn't have what I thought would be the necessary background knowledge that a lot of sequels assume you know.That was not the case as the Narnia novels are almost independent adventures with some reoccurring characters to focus around. Voyage of the Dawn Treader is the third film of the franchise base upon the classic books by CS Lewis based upon the adventures of the Pevensie children in the mythical realm of Narnia. The film is set only three years after the last film even though the gap between the first two films is centuries. Another odd thing is apparently only two of the Pevensie children (Edmund and Lucy) travel to Narnia along with their cousin Eustace (who comes of as a pretentious, pathetic child destined for a job as a banker or something like that).The children appear on the Dawn Treader a ship owned and captained by Prince Caspian who is looking for his fathers seven advisers. Its at this point that someone who has not seen the original films will struggle slightly but it is rather easy to pick a basic outline of the plot for the last film (Caspian does mention briefly his uncles hostile takeover). The film the outlines the new villain which is apparently the mysterious mist which is the essence of evil (they really had no back story about the mist and it is really poorly explained) and which only by collecting seven swords which are held by the seven lords that they were already looking for and placing them on Aslan's (Aslan is the mythical Lion) table can they destroy the mist.The film is visually great and the Dawn Treader is just a beautiful ship. The Battle scenes are convincing and with the exception of the final one they aren't over the top. The 3D was nothing exceptionally special and at point you wonder whether or not it was just tacked on over the finished product. There is a lot of good humor as well and several of the little kids in the theater couldn't stop laughing.The film has a new director and it really shows at points as the film defers from its old style which really seemed like the Lord of the Rings for kids. The film seems to have evolved under this director and is a touch darker as well.One of the biggest problems was the absence of the older Pevensie children. The younger ones held the film well but I think it would have been better with the older siblings. The acting is all good while not spectacular and the actors play on their respective characters insecurities very well. The constant younger child syndrome that Edmund and Lucy show gets annoying at points and doesn't really evolve into anything other than them briefly learning their lesson.I applaud this latest installment of the franchise for improving on what they had but after seeing the Latest Harry Potter (to which the Chronicles of Narnia will always be compared) you can't help but realize how they could have done better. This is still a great film to take your kids to and it is better than I expected. But the lack of two of the main characters, the long length of time since the predecessor and the rather predictable (yet still enjoyable) plot line take a chunk out of the film.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

They are beautifully imagined and perfectly written - and it's same with the movies. I loved ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" and ""Prince Caspian"", and ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" didn't disappoint me at all! I loved every single second of it. It wasn't exactly like the book, but I think it's even better this way. It was a stunning and breathtaking for watching - all the beauties of Narnia and all the views - fantastic! I loved the ending too, bounded with emotions, just like it should be. I loved the announcing of Jill Pole at the end of the movie by Eustace's mother - that means that we can expect ""The Silver Chair"" to be made into a movie soon - and, I can't wait for it - it was one of my favorite book in the series! I think that they SHOULD do all the books into films, because they are worth it. After ""The Silver Chair"" I think it should be ""The Horse and His Boy"", followed by ""The Magician's Nephew"" and finally (and most epic) ""The Last Battle"". This should be fantastic movie franchise because it's based on my third favorite book series, and the first two are INDEED successful - the Harry Potter film franchise and The Lord of the Rings film franchise!

It is about the journey to true wisdom.While not entirely true to the events in the book, IMHO, this movie is entirely true to the spirit of the book. There are no epic battle scenes through which we can glorify our heroes. Rather the battles depicted are the battles that our heroes face within themselves. It brings to mind the following quote from Chogyam Trungpa - ""The only true battles warriors ever fight are those they fight with themselves.""

170,costycyp,Loved it!,10,26 December 2010,"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is the third film in the series based on CS Lewis' fantasy novels. The movie has nearly everything going for it: lots of swashbuckling action, exotic locations, almost every fantasy creature imaginable, and a decent cast. Will Poulter was an excellent choice for Edmund and Lucy's cousin Eustace. He was an annoying, selfish, brat in the book— and he takes it to the extreme in the film. Towards the end though, the viewer comes to like him. The actors in the previous films seem to meld into their roles perfectly, especially Ben Barnes as Caspian, who seems to have dropped his thick Spanish accent from the first film. This certainly helps performance, allowing him to deliver his lines more fluently. The one cast change that was somewhat disappointing was Simon Pegg as the replacement voice for Reepicheep. He does a decent job, but his voice doesn't fit the character as well as Eddie Izzard in the earlier installment ""Prince Caspian."" The first two movies were ""feel good"" movies, almost Disney-like in nature (heaven forbid). However the questions posed and answered, primarily about ""Aslan's country"" were intriguing and startlingly Christian, the way the books were in the beginning.

Lucy doesn't have the confidence of her older sister Susan and in one sequence compares herself to the beauty of her older sister. Edmund feels jealousy towards his older brother.But it's Eustace who become the stand out character this time around, changing his view of Narnia from a self absorbed brat to a truly compassionate person.Aslan, and Reepicheep both return as does King Caspian, and all I can say is the Dragon sequence has to be seen on the big screen.

My bad experience could be partly attributed to the bad 3D glasses I had, but for the most parts, the movie was 'boring'. Some of my friends even left the theater halfway. I haven't read any of the Narnia books, so my opinions about the story too will be completely based on the movie. The portrayal of Actions and adventures were of a clichéd style. The adventures on the sea will make us recall the pirates of Caribbean, but the experience of nowhere near even in 3D. At some places, the settings may lead our imagination to think of some exciting twists but nothing happens and the movie takes its normal course. Don't know whether to blame the movie or the actual story. Also I didn't quiet understand how the time lines go between Narnia and the real world. Between first and second movie, a 1000 years passed in Narnia while only an year in the real world, but in this movie, it looks like both time lines move at nearly comparable pace. Overall, it is a decent watch for a kids and normal movie goers.

Oh and don't even bother watching this in 3D because like most 3D movies that come out now, It didn't have any 3D in it at all. Practically I was able to watch half of the movie without 3D glasses. Also the best part of the movie was just a scene stolen from Ghostbusters but instead of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man, it was a slug sea monster thing that can open up and has bug legs inside of it ( the bug legs are never explained). Also the orphans get way less screen time than Eustace (the comic-relief character that isn't funny).

The visuals are stunning, in terms of them its like Pirates of the Caribbean meets harry potter a little bit. I'd say this is a good family film for all ages and sticks to the main story of the book.

177,Anhun,A beautiful adventure,9,17 February 2011,"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader was a thrilling adventure, an emotional journey, a visually gorgeous vacation, but . . . there are some things I would have done differently.Now, I'm a pretty serious Narniac, so I could write a small novel picking apart every aspect of this film. I'll spare you all and focus instead on the performances, the most important part of any film for me. I do have one general comment to make, though. The book VDT has 7 distinct story lines, and it is clear that the filmmakers struggled in trying to fit all of that into a 2 hour movie. Instead of removing some of the story lines, or (what I would have done) turning the book into 2 movies, they chose to trim down the story lines and simplify the themes. This works better in some parts than in others.Ben Barnes as King Caspian: This was the shocker for me. Gone is that bumbling kid who overacted his way through the film Prince Caspian. Barnes played Caspian with confidence and warmth. He was so much like the character in the book that when I reread the book after watching the movie, I enjoyed it that much more because I was picturing Ben Barnes' performance. King Caspian in the book has a subtle sensitivity that surfaces occasionally, and I saw that it the film. Yet he also has a masterful confidence that, at times, devolves into swaggering egotism. Barnes portrayed this side of his character as well. That being said, they cut out a lot of Caspian's dialog from the book so that neither his virtues nor his flaws are painted in strong colors. I was disappointed that they took out the scene where Caspian puts Gumpas (such a delightfully ridiculous villain)in his place, and replaced it with an acrobatic fight scene.Skandar Keynes as Edmund Pevensie: Competent. He was believable at all times, but he lacked an enthusiasm for the part. He never stole the show, but he never distracted from it either.Will Poulter as Lucy and Edmund's cousin, Eustace Clarence Scrubb: Phenomenal. For the first half of the film, he is the guy you love to hate. Obnoxious, whiny, selfish, talking down to everyone as though they are beneath him. Poulter played this part over the top, and it worked brilliantly. You can't wait for him to get his comeuppance, and boy does he get it! I loved how they did the scene where he reveals his identity to Edmund, pure adventure. When he returns to his original form, Poulter's portrayal of Eustace's emotional transformation had a subtlety that contrasted beautifully with his performance in the first part of the film.Georgie Henley as Lucy Pevensie: Georgie, Georgie, what can I say about Georgie? She is an energetic young actress. At her best, she is dynamic and enchanting. There are some scenes that I really can't picture being played by anyone else. She was so moving in the farewell sequence. I also loved the way she portrayed Lucy's delight at returning to Narnia, and various other parts of the movie. On the other hand, at her worst, she overacts rather badly. The part where she makes it snow in the Magician's mansion was dreadful. I didn't believe her excitement at all.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

Whether intended as a conclusion to a trilogy, or simply whetting our appetites for more films in the series, it left this reviewer thoroughly sated.

This one however, seemed to lack that..certain something. It just seemed like they were exploiting the success of the first two and quickly brought out a third to ride the wave of success. To those not familiar with the books or who are watching this with no previous knowledge of the prior movies, the story will seem confusing.My biggest criticism is that the movie seemed eerily similar to a made for TV show (ie: Hercules with Kevin Sorbo). Everything from the acting, special effects, to the ho-hum bloodless, fights. Also, the cousin character was so annoying he became a 'jar jar binks' style hindrance throughout the entire movie!

180,champagne_starfish,Better in the series than as a stand alone film,5,17 December 2010,"""The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader"" is the third film in the latest adaptation of C.S. Lewis' novels. It is third in sequence and third in order of worthy acclaim. This film seems confused, it doesn't know whether it is a movie for adults and children alike, or a children's film. Some of it can seem like a film for everyone, but it can seem extremely simple and a little too light. Almost like it is was made especially for children under 10. If it was made to be a film primarily for young children, this would be fine and it would be critiqued as a children's film, but it is not so will be critiqued as a film for families and singles alike. .....which is unfortunate for the film makers. ""The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader"" sees Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keynes) return to Narnia with their cousin, Eustace (Will Poulter). They once again meet up with Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) as they try to defeat the new evil in Narnia.""The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader"" is a beautiful film visually to watch. The visual effects are very impressive and the fantasy segments are highly realistic. The special effects are perhaps the best thing about the film. However, while watching the film you cannot help but think that you are watching a cross between ""Lord Of The Rings"" and ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"". As impressive as the visuals are, it feels as if it has been seen before. The Narnia chronicles, with this film, just seem to have outdone they stay this time around. It doesn't feel suspenseful at all and can seem to drag throughout the film. The simplicity of the film seems out of place at this stage of the series. Yes, it is based on the book and the film makers are staying true to the book so they can't be blamed too much, but with the right script, editing and acting, this could have been avoided.Simply, the acting isn't to write home about in this film. Ben Barnes does not give a bad performance in his second film as the courageous Prince Caspian. It is not an Oscar winning performance, but brings all the can be bought into the role as a fantasy prince. Skandar Keynes is also not altogether bad as Edmund and is probably the best out of the younger actors in his role. Georgie Henley's performance seems forced and completely lacks emotion. In the earlier Narnia films, she was adorable as youngest Lucy, but it seems as if it may have been her childish cuteness which made her successful in the role previously. Henley is in that awkward stage of being between the child and adult actor and it is actually painful to watch. Will Poulter's Eustace is supposed to seem completely painful, but his performance is one which you would expect to see on stage in school theater. It is harsh, but his acting in the film is completely amateur and more stage acting than film acting. Of course, this cannot just be blamed on the actors, but also on Michael Apted's direction. It is so obvious that there was a change of director from the first two films to this film and Apted is definitely not a bad director, but maybe he is just not accustomed to how he should be directing younger actors in a fantasy film. However, its not a talent which one would normally have.It is hard for a film which is part of a series of films to be reviewed as a stand alone film. It is harder to do so when as a stand alone film it fails more than as a film in a series. ""The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader"" seems like a mess on screen and would definitely not be successful if it weren't part of ""The Chronicles Of Narnia"". As it is part of the chronicles, it will still be successful at the box office as no one can resist the charms of C.S. Lewis.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

The problem here isn't the underlying story it is the screenplay.It was always going to be difficult to capture the full extent of the Dawn Treader's voyage in the time limits of a single film. So yes, understandably, some parts of the story are rushed through. Why then waste time adding in plot elements that weren't in the book? The mist, the seven swords, the extra family on board - they add nothing to the story. In fact, they just cheapen it and flatten it out into a rushed generic tale that does little to capture any sense of adventure or mystery.Even the one cast change is indicative of how much of a damp squib this adaptation is. Eddie Izzard captured the swagger and bravado of Reepicheep in Prince Caspian. I had to look up who replaced him in this film. Simon Pegg's voice was unrecognisable - not because he isn't capable of portraying darling Reep, but because it was the a halfhearted performance of an actor who realises the script is a turkey.If you're an adult wanting to watch this to revisit the story you loved as a child, don't bother. Search out the old BBC adaptation instead. No matter how dreadful the special effects seem now, at least the story will be the fantastic one you remember.If you're thinking of buying this for a child, please don't. Buy them or read them the book. Let their imaginations fill out the story in all it' s glorious and original detail. Don't spoil it for them by letting them see this dreadful, limiting and limited offering.The only reason to sit through this film until the bitter, saccharine and unsatisfying end is to witness the full horror of how badly Fox, Walden and its writers treated this great story - even compared to the previous Narnian efforts.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
182,elizabethnightingalesmith,Meh... Watchable,4,29 April 2016,"I didn't much care for the last Narnia movie, since Peter and Susan were to leave Narnia for good and for their younger siblings to 'learn' more about themselves.Honestly when I was a kid, I loved these movies, and now as I've become more in tune with my opinion I notice LOADS of flaws.One; The camera is constantly moving, which DOES give for a more action, moving and free movie. But compared to the first movie, this in comparison looks like a B class movie, there's careless mistakes, like the moving of the camera when the scene calls for a 'calm' or 'still' shot. Seriously, it looks like something that a teenager would make in the sense they don't know about anything about filming.Two; The acting was okay, it seemed forced almost in the beginning. I didn't quite believe the 'Oh i'm not pretty' cliché, fair enough, Susan is a lot prettier than Lucy, and the 'hair behind the ear' put me off Lucy all together. But seriously? Lucy's character had always been brave, naive and strong but all that had been stripped away the last movie because it had been her brothers and sister protecting her, what is she doing now? all we have is the silly teenage predicament of 'am I beautiful'.three; the graphics, and the special effects wasn't that good either. I mean if anybody watches this movie and notices the flaws in the ship, the green magic, and other 'scenic' shots. it does seem a bit fake.Further more, i'd watch this with my kids someday if they really really really liked the first movie and second movie, and it was something to shut them up so.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

Although I have to say that I was as sad as Edmund and Lucy at the end because just as them, I don't think we will be coming back to Narnia anymore. The special effects and make up lacked the magic of the first two movies, the dialogs were almost too teenager at points losing the wittiness and greatness of the kings and queens we've learned to love and admire. Eustace was at points irritating. And I couldn't stop having the feeling that there was no turning back. We're going to have to learn to love the name of Aslan in our world, because I have serious doubts we will be back anytime soon. To Aslan, Narnia and the Kings and Queens of old.

184,PinkWeeds,Missed the Point of the Story.,2,13 December 2010,"I felt really disappointed when I saw this film. Sure Ben Barnes was great eye candy in this movie but other than that there wasn't anything to enjoy.The book was this adventure story showing the change of Eustace, a self-centered, no-nonsense boy who didn't believe in anything. The movie was a flash from one island to another showing some made up villain in green smoke which was half-fast and not even slightly thought out.I guess the script writers weren't able to grasp what the story was really about and they thought there had to be some visible villain to fight. The whole book was about Man Vs. Self but by throwing in this green smoke that makes you see what you fear it seemed to take away the realness of how horrible even good people are inside. They really managed to destroy their own movie by making that the center of their story rather than having it be the growing up book it really was.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
185,skyline09,"No action thrown together, just not good",6,15 December 2010,"Film seemed thrown together too quick even tho there was a 3 or 4 year gap between the last. I'm no huge fan and didn't read the books but the 1st two are far better than this one. The additional character that was added the cousin Eustace or however you spell it was very annoying and his voice was horrible. Again I love the 1st two and me and my daughter (7) watched them quite a few times together and she loved them but this one was just a total disappointment. Let me put it this way, I got up about the mid point to go to the bathroom and stood in line to get some popcorn before I returned to the movie. Also everything now a days is 3D my ""PERSONAL OPINION"" its useless and there wasn't anything that was 3D about it, just had to wear those annoying glasses the whole movie.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
186,glenn-362,Check it out.,9,8 December 2010,"Really enjoyed this addition to the series. It strays from the book, and in rather disappointing ways (glossing over Eustace's big lesson at the end, which was a highlight of the book and one of it's most powerful moments) but is still very enjoyable and enchanting. Great world, simple characters and the lessons they learn. Recommended. Big fans of the book should give it a go and perhaps be forgiving of Hollywood's watering of the story and events.The child actors still seem a little shallow, but then they never were super deep characters to begin with. It's more about the world thanabout the Pevensies.Big recommendation is that you DO NOT see the 3D version. Go for 2D and you will enjoy it far more.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
187,natasjarose-1,What the bleeding Hell?,2,4 December 2010,"The first several minutes of the Film, I thought that would be a wonderful addition to the Movie Versions of Narnia. It had a good opening scene and a smooth transition from Prince Caspian to The Dawn Treader. Three scenes later, I was wondering if I had perhaps stepped into the wrong cinema, and if not, when the Chronicles of Narnia turned into a crossover with Deathly Hallows, (Find the seven horcrux - I mean, swords) and what the director and screenwriters were smoking when they filmed this. I spent most of the film staring in horror as the book I loved since childhood was utterly mutilated in the worst book-to-movie adaption since 'Ella Enchanted'. Honestly, the Lone Islands did have a problem with slavery, but there were no human sacrifices, and Lord Bern was a well-off man living happily, if against slave-traders, not some half-mad loon sitting in a dungeon. The Quest was to find the Seven Banished Lords, not to hunt down seven swords, and while I can understand Jadis still lurking among Edmund's fears, the sea serpent was entirely un-necessary. They found Lord Rhoop on the Island of Dreams (BEFORE Ramandu's Island), but he was desperate to get out, not waving his sword around and attacking people. And what orifice did they pull the Evil Mist (TM) out of, anyway? I understood that while Gold/Deathwater Island and Dragon Island were two different places, placing them together was necessary, and carried well, given that both islands brought similar lessons, and the encounter with the Dufflepudds and the Magicitan were pulled off nicely. I found myself praising the Emperor Over The Sea that they got Ramandu's Island and the End of The World/Aslan's Country right. By that point, I was starting to wonder if Miraz was going to come back from the dead and prove to be the 'Great Evil', considering the path the movie was taking. On the positive side, I enjoyed the way that Lucy's insecurity and jealousy of Susan was portrayed, as well as her discovery that she needed to be herself. I also liked the bond between Caspian and the children from our world, and the settings were beautiful.People who have never read the books will probably enjoy it, but those who have will be either foaming at the mouth, or refusing to waste good money seeing it again, if they didn't walk out half-way through.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
188,dieguito_josue,Narnia a good movie with a good Christian message,10,5 December 2010,Narnia the Voyage of the Dawn was great with amazing special effects and the history of the book fair and the best thing that left a good Christian message. I almost start to mourn the end. for me the best of the 3 movies that have been learned. that good that I leave Disney Narnia because with this new Fox movie was awesome. I will be satisfied and 3D was great congratulations to strive for this movie I love and enjoy and I hope that people who watch this movie are satisfied as I was when I left the cinema.

189,linneasr,Very rich and well produced,9,19 December 2010,"A very enjoyable movie, with much attention given to detail and tone. There were many parts I liked very much (Sean Rangi as Tavros, and Eustace's reaction to meeting a minotaur; the slow development of Eustace and Reepicheep's friendship; Edmund's courage in drawing the sea serpent to the prow, and many others), yet there were bits in the book that I wish had also been present in the film. Aslan's conversation with Eustace before turning him back into a boy, for one. Actually seeing the dragon before it dies, for another.I've already been to see it twice, though, so the parts I miss don't seem to be diminishing my enthusiasm for it. Highly recommended!",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
190,jennanoah,Dawn Treader is incredibly entertaining and deep in meaning!!,10,20 November 2010,"This is by far the best so far of the Narnia films! Loaded with action and adventure, really funny scenes where Eustace's attitude and twisted face provide many laughs, and spiritual symbolism that is so rich -- this film is a total winner! I loved Reepicheep's courage and dignity, and the virtue in spite of struggle of the Pevensies. Aslan comes through in the lives of those he loves in his perfect timing. Jam-packed with special effects, this movie is visually stunning and will be an excellent film for families with tweens and teens! My teenage daughter loved it too -- we went to a special preview screening last night. I'm definitely going to recommend this film to all of the families I know, and I can't wait to see it again . . . already!",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
191,katie-660-485342,"Price Caspian was perfect, this one was a flop story-wise.",5,12 December 2010,"Dawn Treader, in my opinion was a great disappointment. The scenery was nice but the story was VERY altered and weak. The main characters had very few lines. Caspian although the same actor had a different accent, and Reepicheep a new voice. The movie doesn't focus on the real reason Eustace became a dragon, a type of punishment for being such a mean person, but simply for picking up gold. The new plot of searching for seven magic swords, that all the MAD seven lords conveniently have was lame. If you, like I, thought Prince Caspian was better then the book, and feel you must see this third movie to, wait and see it at a dollar theater.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
192,jadamsclassic,Tread lightly with this movie,5,13 March 2013,"The story was just Pirates of the Caribbean meets Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. There were slavers, green mist that took people, and even a giant sea-serpent that attacked reminiscent of the Kraken from the second Pirates movie. I'm not going to go too into detail about the story because I was half-asleep through some of it. From what I gathered, Caspian wanted to find or find out what happened to his father which is when the whole green mist thing comes into play. The green mist shows you your worst nightmare or something like that and takes you away to their ""Dark Island."" There was no other motivation for this island to do this other than to be the scapegoat for the plot. I mean the previous two Narnia movies had decent antagonists who had motives for doing the bad things they do. In ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe,"" the White Witch wanted to take the land from Aslan (basically God in lion form... but I'll get to that in a minute) and turn the land into an icy dominion for her and her minions. In ""Prince Caspian,"" Miraz didn't want his nephew, Prince Caspian, to assume the throne so he devised an assassination attempt to disrupt Caspian's lineage so that the throne would go to Miraz and his unborn child. The green mist in ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" just does these things just because, hey, why the hell not? The heroes, plus Eustace, need SOMETHING to block their path. The entire movie felt like it was rushed, like it didn't spend too much time developing a scene. It was just go to this island, find one of the seven swords of lords that can stop the mist, some sort of obstacle gets in the way, rinse and repeat.The added cousin character, Eustace, was really annoying and I had hoped he would die. I thought I got my wish but, alas, this was not so as he was only turned into a dragon. It was then when I witnessed the QUICKEST character adjustment I think I've ever seen in a movie. He was always this annoying little prat of a child, focused on logic and facts, and wanting to kill his cousins from the get-go. It was only AFTER being turned into a dragon that he forgets about all that and just goes to being this accepting, caring character. Although, to be fair, being turned into a dragon would make one reconsider their logic pretty quickly.I was thoroughly disappointed with the final battle. In the words of The Mad Hatter, It ""lost it's muchness."" The previous two movies had epically scaled battles between the forces of good and evil, usually with, ""For Narnia, and FOR ASLAN!"" being shouted by the side of good and each side running towards the other to be locked in combat. While we get ""For Narnia,"" in VotDT, it just seems lacking and forced. We get no such epic run, but instead, we're treated to more green mist and then, from a scene out of Ghostbusters, Edmund accidentally thinks of his worst fear; the giant sea-serpent, which makes it appear from the mist. I felt this was a weird, out-of-the-blue ""plot-twist,"" if you could call it that, because the sea-serpent was only mentioned once or twice and it wasn't hinted at that Edmund was afraid of it.When Dragon-Eustace flies away after being accidentally stabbed by one of the lords- gone-mad, Aslan appears just in the nick of time, like always, to save Dragon-Eustace from his current predicament. Eustace finds himself with the last lord sword needed to stop the mist. Showing for the first time Human-Eustace being a noble heroic, he puts the sword with the others and the mist and sea-serpent dissipates. Narnia is safe from the evil green mist and it's time for the Pevensie's to return home, but this time for good. They have no more use for Narnia and Narnia has no more use for them. But don't worry, EUSTACE can come back! Oh joy!It is in this sequence that Aslan said something that really bothered me. Now, back story; Aslan was always this mystical lion that had mystical powers with his roar. It was heavily speculated that Aslan was really an allegory for Jesus or God himself. While this theory wasn't approved or disapproved, it was still fun to think about. This theory was supported by the line, ""Two sons of Adam, and two daughters of Eve"" saving Narnia; of course referring to Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy. ""Voyage"" heavily implied, if not confirmed, that Aslan is in fact God; he's ""always watching"" the Pevensie's, even when in their world. Now, he's either Santa, or, more likely, Jesus/God. Look, I have an open mind about this kind of thing, but when the Christian undertones become the Christian overtones, I become disinterested.The only redeeming qualities were the performances, though Ben Barnes kind of lost his Spanish accent from the second film and some of the fight choreography was slapdash and laughable at times, and the visuals. All of the actors and actresses gave it their all with what they were given and the animation and CG effects weren't something to wave a stick at.In conclusion -The story is less engaging than the previous installments. -Eustace, the Pevensie's cousin, is very unlikable and annoying. -It felt rushed, like it was just a bunch of random scenes put together. -The end battle was anti-climactic. -The ""antagonist"" has little to no motivation and is forgettable because of it. -Aslan is God. -The actors' performances saved the film.If you've seen the other two Narnia films, then I'd still see this one just to complete it. Maybe just rent it from Netflix or something.I give it a 5.5/10",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

It starts with Lucy and Edmund, staying with their cousin Eustace. Lucy, Edmund and Eustace enter into the world of Narnia through a painting of sea and taken aboard on the Dawn Treader where they meets Caspian. Caspian is on the mission of finding the seven lost lord of Narnia.On the Dawn Treader and in most part of the movie I found the Reepicheep and Eustace was able to manage the comic part of movie well and they did great job.In last couple of years Lucy grown up as a beautiful lady and I would admire her present in this movie in comparison to Susan, however, she was not able to get the actor out of her and got failed to make manage to keep the audience engage with her. I think Ben is a nice actor and I was highly impressed with his presents in the last Narnia series and he has the persona of a young and cute guy so I think He could have been better in this movie as well if he got her shave cleaned.I am always compelled to appreciate Aslan and superb dialogs delivery of Liam Nesson.Coming on the visuals, I think, I was expecting more and it could have been more much magical.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

Not feeling at home with their aunt and uncle, Edmund and Lucy desire to have yet another adventure. Hearing of Peter and Susan's adventure in America does not ease their yearnings. As they are not at home and desiring another adventure, Lucy and Edmund must find their way into Narnia.Once arriving in Narnia, Edmund and Lucy learn of relative peace happening in all the Narnia. If they were not called and Narnia is experiencing peace, why have the two Pevensie children found themselves in Narnia? While outside of Narnia, Edmund and Lucy longed to be in Narnia because they are not at home. Why are they not at home? Perhaps their world, like Narnia at times, is defined by a conflict between good and evil. As long as a struggle between good and evil exists, one is not at home in that world. This is because one knows that there should be peace and home is where evil is not. Lucy and Edmund quickly learn that 7 seven former Lords have disappeared. Caspian last knew that they were on the 'Lone Islands.' Having sailed to the Lone Islands Caspian, Lucy, and Edmund learn peace is not present in all of Narnia. Only finding one of the seven former Lords, the three discover that evil is slowly triumphing in Narnia as one person at time vanishes in a strange mist. As it turns out the mist is controlled by the powers of evil present in Narnia and the only way to return peace to the land is defeat of evil powers. The former Lord believes the rest sailed off in search for the mist. Lucy, Edmund, and Caspian believe it is their duty go off in search of the other six Lords and defeat the evil in the East. As they sent out their longing is for peace to return to Narnia and to be at truly at home. Along the way the three discover temptation by the things their hearts desire. Is being as beautiful as another person, having gold and silver, and obtaining power as satisfying to heart as we believe.Seeking to bring peace back to Narnia, while combating temptation by the evil forces, Lucy, Edmund and Caspian must identify what they truly desire. Only when giving up the desires they want along the way, will they find the source to defeat evil. While they want to defeat evil and return peace to Narnia, Edmund, Lucy and Caspian discover they cannot achieve victory alone. In giving up what they want in life for the true desire of peace in Narnia, they find Aslan and his power.Although Edmund and Lucy are high king and queen of Narnia, they serve as king and queen not by any merit of themselves. Only in giving up of themselves are they king and queen. Through this voyage Lucy and Edmund discover what life is and life's meaning. More importantly, they discover that they can be at home outside of Narnia because Aslan promises to always be with them and He will bring them to Him at the end of time. Thus, for Lucy and Edmund to be king and queen is it to give up the position to another or keep it.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

It did far better than I expected, and will be looking forward to the next movie to come. I think they embraced the added character Eustace well. I think he was the best character of them all and also the talking rat. I found Eustace funny, and entertained me greatly. I think they should a changed Eustace of the course of the film. I think it was clever the way they added in Susan and Peter, as they could no longer go to Narnia anymore.

But if you watch it the series with the other two movies, the quality of it would fade instantly. I cannot count this movie as one of the same series as the other Narnia movies, it hasn't got the same feeling. So in comparison with them, it looses. Some of the acting is good, but I feel as if the actors doesn't get the opportunity to use their abilities to the fullest. The material they've been given to work with doesn't use their full potential, and because of that they all seem to be a little shallow. Positives: Two gorgeous looking kings (Skandar Keynes as Edmund Pevensie and Ben Barnes as Caspian) are a great plus, and probably one of the main reasons I can still watch this movie.Beautiful environments.Speed; it doesn't bore you. Those small elements which they bring back from previous films. They bring back a small glimpse of the magic which the first ones held.Negatives: Far away from the book's plot.The creatures of Narnia aren't as well made as in previous films.Will Poulter as Eustace.

197,thundyrwaves,Horrible!,1,3 November 2016,"This movie was a major disappointment. The movie for The Voyage of the Dawn Treader was a huge flop when it comes to being accurate to the book. The entire plot was changed. Sure, they still wanted to find the seven lost lords, and to find Aslan's Country, but there were so many things they changed. It was quite ridiculous. The first scene was accurate, except that Eustace didn't use his book as a diary until after entering Narnia. Then, once they were in Narnia, the first few moments were accurate, but after that, it all just went downhill. First, with Eustace trying to steal food: he never did that in the book. He tried to steal water. Reepicheep trying to teach Eustace how to swordfight: that never happened in the book. The dufflepuds attacking Caspian and his men: that never happened. Lucy reciting the spell to make her look like Susan: that never happened. Lucy reciting the spell to bring snow: that never happened. And Aslan never appeared to Coriakin and Lucy in the movie, like he did in the book. Prince Caspian, Eustace, Reepicheep, Lucy, and Edmund weren't kidnapped by a slave trader in the movie like they were in the book. In the movie, there was also a green mist that was a huge part of the movie. This was never in the book. In the movie, when they entered the Dark Island, a sea serpent tried to destroy the ship. In the book, nothing really happened in the Dark Island except for finding one of the seven lords. The sea serpent, in the book, came earlier on, but it was easily defeated. Also, Jadis is again in the movie, when in the book she was barely even mentioned. Plus, the whole deal with the seven sword of the seven lords...ugh. That wasn't in the book either! Never once was it. In addition to that, in the movie, Caspian went with Lucy, Edmund, Eustace, and Reepicheep to the world's end, while in the book, he quite clearly wasn't allowed to.

Dawn Treader, while perhaps taking some liberties again, stays true to the themes more so than all the others perhaps, certainly moving closer than Price Caspian and more in line with LWW.The visual effects are stunning. I would agree that the 3D is certainly nothing to blow your mind, but that said--these special effects would look good in black and white.Out of all the characters, and there is a vast array, I have to hand it to three characters. Aslan, Reepicheep, and Eustace.Aslan's character is majestic as always. You do get a chill of excitement the moment you first see him. Everyone does, kids to adults.Reepicheep is so adorable that I think everybody falls in love with him and is cheering for him and heck, he takes the place of leading man.Last, Eustace. Will Poulter does such a great job and I guess the best way to describe his acting and character in the film: bring on the Silver Chair! I look forward to having him in the next two films.If you liked the first two movies, you'll enjoy this one.

However 3d is again wasted on this movie where all the have done is given it the minimal amount of 3d . there's only one spot on the whole thing where 3d was good and it lasted a matter of seconds. watch for Lucy and her bow. The Sony 3d camera advert before the movie had way more 3d. Unfortunately this movie really did not have the pace i was expecting or the adventure. it just seems to be more or a plod of the dawn treader . younger kids may enjoy this but i recommend waiting for DVD as your not missing anything in 3d or digital .,The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

It may be starting out with tough reviews, but your kids are going to love itWhat I would change: The contains a lot of lessons, each character learns their own, but instead of rushing a few, I would have dropped some so the rest could be properly emphasizedAll in all, a very enjoyable film, and you gotta remember, it's not Harry Potter, getting more in depth into the complex emotions of a wizard teen.

The 3D effect of Sea, the Ship and all the other things were amazing. It is very much better than Alice in Wonderland 3D. Although there were some parts which were dark and it was difficult to identify, but i think that was to prevent piracy.The Story begins with (as usual) Edmund and Lucy in England. This time Edmund wanted to join army. They were living with their uncle and aunt and having a really annoying cousin. Peter and Susan went to their dad in USA.It was really shameful so see Queen Lucy was kept for selling(Pathtic).Entire movie was the sea journey. How they found the problem caused by Fog. How to stop the evil fog from taking people. Also, finding the 7 swords of the 7 kings, i thought was not easy. But in the movie it was very easy, except the last one.The sound quality was good but was not that much good as Resident Evil Afterlife.

The film felt like they took the original story, chopped it up, then threw it in a blender with seven magical swords and some ridiculous green mist! While the film stayed true to main themes of the story, much of the character development and purpose to each of the minor island stories was lost. Unfortunately this meant that most of the magic of the story was lost as well.I gave the film 6 stars due to the redeeming qualities that were the stunning visuals, some excellent acting (notably by Will Poulter as Eustace), and a beautifully executed final scene.If you haven't read the book, then you may enjoy this film immensely, but if you are a true Narnia fan, don't go in with very high expectations.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
204,wrichards8,"A pretty good, fun movie with merit",6,22 December 2010,"Lucy and Edmund Pevensie return to Narnia with their cousin Eustace where they meet up with Prince Caspian for a trip across the sea aboard the royal ship The Dawn Treader. I thought the sets looked fantastic and the characters of Reepicheep and Eustace were the fun to watch. The actor playing Eustace had, I think, excellent comic timing. The relationship between them was funny and touching. In my mind, the only things I will say are that the dialogue could have been better written and the music didn't make the film feel quite as epic as it could have done. Having said that, I did think this film was better than The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, which I am not keen on. I can't comment on the 3D version of this film, because I haven't seen it, but I hear it's not worth seeing",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

I'm alive.... the only thing which kept me alive all along was the will i had in myself and i told to myself that the movie will get over soon....This movie taught me the power of will in my life....Guys, I really beg you, Please don't waste your time and money on watching this movie.... I've never usually comment on any films, but this one, I had to, It made me too....I read the comments before i went to movie, but i forgot to read the second half of the review... please read all of them before you go to the movie, If there is a negative marking in the IMDb, for sure i would give -10 out 10 for this movie.Thanks, Think twice before you watch this movie.....",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
206,dstarw,Stop the 3D terribleness! So many good stories ruined...,7,6 June 2011,"Although I know it's rare for a movie to match the excellence of the book it was made from I thought that with the Narnian books being so short this one would have no problem sticking closer to C.S. Lewis' original storyline. But then they turned the character of Eustace into the comic relief, mixed up all the islands, left out almost ALL of the fun, cool, and weird things from the Dufflepud Island, made Lucy and Edmund whiny, envious babies, completely cut Ramandu's character, added some weird green mist which was just stupid/unnecessary, and inserted WAAAAAYY too many effects that you can tell were only used for the 3D version. I know liberties are taken when transforming from the written word to the big screen but why is it so many good novels are being ruined for the sake of 3D? They did the same thing with Airbender which should have been amazing... but definitely wasn't. BOOOOOOOOOOOOO to 3D. Yes it looked beautiful in Avatar and adds depth to animation but the story should ALWAYS come first and the actors should help you get lost in a movie, not make the mistakes more noticeable! A lot of the scenes are painful with poor acting, for example the scene where the mother is taken and the child and father are yelling for her. You can see Lucy smile while she's in irons before she tucks her head in her arms ""scared"", and the little girl's face is anything but pained with the loss of her mother... ugh. Lucy was really good in the first Narnian movie but I can't blame her for having trouble acting in a movie that doesn't give you any true inspiration to grab onto in the first place.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
207,rubyjem27,What you see in a film is very often a measure of what you bring to it,8,12 December 2010,"It is really sad to see that Voyage of the Dawn Treader not doing so well. I'm not quite sure why, as it is a marvellously crafted and thoughtful film which is relevant to everyone in a family. I know the critics are often people who dislike C.S.Lewis and Christianity. But this film also expresses ethical values that transcend mere Christianity.I enjoyed the 2D version immensely. I was able to see how all the plot points fitted together, and to appreciate the film's fidelity to the original book. I don't agree that the 3D version was too dark, but given the way people consistently left out the subsequent events to the ones they were complaining about, or complained about departures from their idea of the text, I wonder if the 3D effects did not distract the audience too much from the actual film? The acting was good, especially that of Simon Pegg voicing Reepicheep, Will Poulter as Eustace and Ben Barnes as King Caspian. Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley also played good parts, illustrating exactly why their characters needed a return trip to Narnia. The visuals were delightful, including the lovingly created Dawn Treader, itself, and yes, I did feel very much the same magic present in the first movie and in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies. If there is one quibble I might have, it is that the movie was too squashed by so many critical expectations. It might be difficult, for instance, to squeeze a story with themes which still challenge adults, into a PG format. Would anyone say that the underlying themes of VDT are too deep for a PG rating, and should really have been made with PG 13+ or M in mind? Or rather, do we all agree that we all do wrong things, no matter what our ages, that even little children might understand that in so many cases it is ourselves who are really our worst enemies?Or is it more likely the case that many of the more outspoken readers of the book who feel the book should have been done 'their' way, tend to have PG 13+ imaginations? C.S.Lewis' Narnia books were written for children, and whilst they can be read and enjoyed by adults and children alike, the film has done a good job of keeping VDT, at any rate, accessible to the schoolchildren for whom it was always intended.The film also suffers from the critics who deplore any change from the book's rather episodic format, which suited the old BBC television version of Voyage of the Dawn Treader much better than does the current Walden format. I thought the extra added bits quite good, adding a bit of action, tension and explanation not seen in the book. Otherwise, the film not only does proper justice to the book, it exceeds it in character development, in a cohesive retelling of the story. When reading the book, I never understood why Edmund needed to be in Narnia though I could see why Eustace or Lucy might have things to learn. At times I thought that Caspian was too Miraz-like, however good his intentions, whilst Edmund came across as being above and beyond his control, and not hesitating to say so. But the film does a good job of fleshing out these characters in all their faults and weaknesses. And how well the Reepicheep and Eustace relationship develops from mutual antagonism to the point that Eustace is really distressed at parting from his little mate. Perhaps it may be the case that critics and fans alike come to watch any movie, in particular this one, with their own prejudices, gripes, likes and dislikes, well in place, and so cannot enjoy any movie that does not fit their own self-image? Whatever is the case, it really is a pity if VDT does not do well. This is a great movie to take your children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews and others to see. I hope it does well, despite any bad reviews.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
208,js38336,"a great film for the entire family, and the type of film that belongs in December and should be watched time and time again by young and old alike!",8,2 December 2010,"Chronicles of Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn TreaderIt has been a few years now and a studio, director, and production team change since we last had a Narnia film but finally the third film in the series, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, has finally come to screen and what can I say? It is well worth your money for you and your entire family to see it. The film is made by 20th Century Fox and Walden Media, directed by Michael Apted, still with actors Ben Barnes as Prince Caspian, Liam Neesan as the voice of Aslan the Lion, Skander Keynes again as Edmund, Georgie Henley as Lucy, with Will Poulter (Son of Rambow) as their cousin Eustace.The story centers around Edmund and Lucy returning to Narnia this time with their whiny cousin Eustace where they meet up with Prince Caspian, now King Caspian, onboard the Narnia ship the Dawn Treader. With years of peace enjoyed in Narnia, they are unsure why they are there but soon find themselves on an adventure to battle a mysterious force that threatened Narnia where they face slavers, dragons, temptation, serpents, and learn to become greater than they ever thought they could be. The film follows the plot of the book very well expanding in order to make it flow as a proper story. The additions are perfectly plausible and make the story more cohesive and unlike the changes in Prince Caspian, improve the story. Flowing along quickly, this is by far the shortest in runtime of the series yet also the most powerful and magical, it starts well and ends on a such a high emotional note there are few that will escape unaffected from any screening.Special effects stand out, with the absence of WETA in the production and special effects I was anxious to see if the new team, actually a fairly large group of small companies, could match what WETA was able to create I am here to tell you YES and in some ways they have surprassed their creations. The dragon and a sea serpent in the film alone are well worth admission, both created with much care and love and really the magic of a fantasy world involved. Other characters from Reepicheep the mouse, a Minotaur, and other creatures are beautiful to behold. The only one that seemed a little down was Aslan who though looking good seems a step down from what WETA created in Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian but the rest is so vivid with color and imagination there is little doubt that it will not just capture the imagination of the young but the entire family and keep them from first shot to last frame.Music is another powerful entry, the strong Narnia theme running through this film giving it wonder and magic that belongs in this type of film. The strongest song though involves the arrival of a dragon, a piece with great power and a pulse that gives one of the most powerful scenes in the film even greater amazement and magic. Do you want to capture the imagination of a child and your childhood, an escapist film that will be great entertainment for the entire family? THIS IS THAT FILM!Acting has been hit but this one features better acting and character moments than the other films. With fewer characters than the other two films this one can focus more on the characters and each of the main characters get multiple character building moments that give us greater love and really infuses the film with such emotional power that its hard not to be moved, especially by the climax. Everyone from Edmund to Lucy, to Caspian, to Reepicheep, to Eustace, get powerful scenes that culimate in the strongest ending to a Narnia films and one of the most poignant scenes I have seen in a film in a very long time.Christians out there, do you fear that the Christian themes are stripped out of this movie? Do not fear, this film is as powerfully religious as it is in magic. All of the religious undertones are not covered but are out in the open for all to see. There is no fear, like what Disney had, when it comes to hitting these themes and the director displays them in all their glory with as much power as C.S. Lewis wrote them to be.The 3D of the film was fine, it does not detract now does it really add. I believe one would be fine seeing it or not seeing it in 3D, whatever you prefer.Overall, Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a powerful entry in the fantasy genre, a great film for the entire family, and the type of film that belongs in December and should be watched time and time again by young and old alike! I give this film an 8.5/10.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
209,xcullenxgirlx,As hardcore fan of the BOOK series...,9,18 December 2010,"AMAZING. I very much enjoyed the dialogue, the casting, the CGI was iffy, but decent, and of course I loved the message of temptation. The movie did not follow the book as much as I had hoped, but the changes were satisfying enough. More thoughts: -- Lucy (Georgie Henley) was fantastic in this film. Now that Peter and Susan are gone, she and Edmund must take their places. Lucy is jealous of Susan's beauty, and her desire is to be just as beautiful. Henley was absolutely amazing in this film. Lucy, although important but still standing by the sidelines for the first 2 films, Henley really stood out in this film. Go Georgie! -- Edmund (Skandar Keynes) took a lot of responsibility in this film. Though Edmund is replacing his brother, he is still a lower rank to King Caspian. He is tempted by jealousy and seeks to appear more important. Keynes' acting was fantastic in this film. He brings a lot of humor, but also a fair amount of control to the screen. Good work, Skandar! -- Caspian (Ben Barnes) was hilarious. Something I noticed while watching Prince Caspian last week, the boy barely smiles. Lighten up. But in Dawn Treader, the man finally shows his sense of humor. Caspian is tempted by memories of his father so he slightly struggles to focus. Barnes is just awesome and you can't deny it. He's gorgeous, hilarious, and a great actor. What's not love? He did excellent and I hope he returns in The Last Battle. Maybe even The Silver Chair. BEN!! :D :D -- Reepicheep (Simon Pegg) was very.... I can't really find the word...uhhh...spiffy, maybe...? ;) He and Eustace were a huge crowd pleaser; very entertaining and fit very well in the story. Pegg was an excellent replacement for Eddie Izzard and his voice has the same edge that still gives Reep that awesomeness we're familiar with. Well done, Simon! -- Eustace (Will Poulter) was very annoying to begin with, but you get used to it and it later becomes very funny and entertaining. Eustace is very self-centered and easily despised 'til he turns into a dragon and everything gets better from there. Poulter was the PERFECT choice for Eustace and can't wait to see how he does in The Silver Chair. I also wonder who will play Jill Pole... :) Very good, Will!--- All in all, a well done movie. I wish they had shown Caspian get married and I also would have preferred that director Micheal Apted not take out Ben Barnes Spanish accent. I noticed the original plot of the book had been changed but I must say, I was very pleased with the way it all turned out on the big screen. The goodbyes of the Pevensies, Caspian, Eustace, Reep, and Aslan moved me to tears, but I look forward to seeing everyone in The Last Battle!

212,allieh-919-886325,Skip the 3 D,7,9 December 2010,"Opening this weekend is Walden Media and 20th Century Fox's, ""The Chronicles of Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader,"" the third movie in the CS Lewis series of seven. Say that title three times and make a wish as Walden and Fox are betting big on this film.After Disney dropped the series, citing any future installment would be a bad investment, Walden/Fox picked up the rights and revamped the story incorporating characters from ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe,"" that were not prominent in the original CS Lewis Story of the same title. ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,"" is a fast paced and action filled story that keeps you so enthralled you may forget to chomp down on that $10 popcorn. Of the three movies, this one is the strongest to date.Lucy and Peter return along with newcomer and quite annoying cousin,""Eustace,"" brilliantly played by Will Poulter, who is known for the movie, ""Son of Rambo."" Poulter was nominated by the British Independent Film Awards as Most Promising Newcomer and plays Eustace so well, that I actually found myself getting irritated with him, as if he was a real boy and not a character in a movie.""Treader"" has some fantastic action sequences, opening with Lucy, Peter, and Eustace becoming swallowed by a painting that transports them to Narnia. Cameo's from returning Tilda Swinton as ""The White Witch,"" and Liam Neeson as ""Aslan"" create a comfortable and fun movie for the whole family. CS Lewis fans will forgive some story changes as they work well and help to create continuity in a franchise that may go the distance to seven films. Christians will be happy to see that the movie follows in it's religious overtones that were dropped by Disney's ""Prince Caspian."" The movie works well and will definitely entertain all ages and Prince Caspian played by Ben Barnes isn't bad on the eyes either.If you enjoyed the previous two movies you will find this one filled with more of what works, action and stunning visuals, and less of what doesn't; to many unnecessary characters. Skip the 3D as it was converted after production and not worth the extra $3. I rate this movie a medium popcorn. You'll probably have some left over at the end and that's a good thing.

It was awful. Many people have already discussed the primary problems with the film via their *spoiler* reviews... but I have to add my vote in a negative direction.They took the islands out of order. Eustace didn't even try to remove his own dragon skin. They ruined several of the lords. They MADE UP crap about a sword and ""dark mist"". Ramandu wasn't even on his island (thus missing my second favorite part of the book about him growing younger). Lucy just pulled Eustaces bracelet off when it's not supposed to come off easily. The dufflepuds didn't learn how to paddle on their foot... and so many more disappointments.Failure on the part of the producers. Eustace and Reepicheep were the best parts of the movie (really it's only redeeming quality). I honestly almost left after staying up until midnight and paying $14 to see it in 3d.If they make the next movie... please let them consult a Lewis expert. These books are classics and favorites for a reason. It is so vain to think they can ""fix"" them. Grrr.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
214,nikkimckelvy,A little cheesy and 3D is blurry/detrimental but overall good.,8,10 December 2010,"I live in S. Korea and it opened here before it opened in the rest of the world. In a sentence, the movie is blurry and cheesy, but good. First the good. The addition of the swords is quite good as is the mist. It follows the book as well as can be expected. The plot is fast paced and the timing is good. There are some comic performances done by both Reepicheap and Eustace. Some of the scenes really were ""laugh out loud"" funny. The movie is a good mix of humor and action. Hints are made at the right places, and overall the acting is passing. Now the bad. Some of the best lines in the book are left out- e.g. when Aslan is talking to Eustace about changing from a dragon back to a boy, but other scenes are added to good effect- e.g. the companionship between Reepicheap and Eustace. The best magic scenes from the book have been subtracted, and the special effects on the Dufflepuds could have been improved. Aslan just looks cheesy and puppet-like this whole movie. He seems to have lost his majesty completely. He spends most of the movie practically immobile and cold, and there is very little interaction between himself and the characters. The 3D is a major detriment. Every scene is blurry, and it doesn't help the special effects at all. I recommend seeing it in 2D. Despite all this, the movie is worth seeing. There is so much in there it would be difficult to get it all in one viewing. Go see.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

Lewis do yourself a favor and don't go watch the movie! You will be sorely disappointed Less than 20 minutes into the film you will find yourself lost and confused. The filmmakers butchered the story-line so badly that I had no idea what was going to happen from one scene to the next. The bizarre plot is totally new and not even remotely close to the book's. The story line is cut up, shifted around and, after the opening scene, not even remotely close to the book. Whole paragraphs of dialog have been edited, dummied down or deleted entirely. Whole scenes and locations have been eliminated or changed, almost as if they were purposely trying to be as different as possible from the book. It felt like the director didn't really like the original Voyage of the Dawn Treader and was trying to make up his own Hollywood version. I've always loved the book so to me it's like someone trying to paint the Mona Lisa in a dark room with Crayola's.

It was visually spectacular, the plot was enthralling, and more than ever its message was timeless and valuable! Some fans of the books may be a little disappointed by how the plot strays from the original work, but they will NOT be disappointed by acting or directing and will be relieved to find Lewis's original intentions well lived up to.

I have read all the books of Chronicles of Narnia several times and I really like them. I also have audio books from Focus on the Family's Radio theater. And I like that really too. I almost know some scenes by heart and I was expecting to see those scenes in this movie too. But as I continued watching the movie I realized that all things were ABSOLUTELY screwed up. I thought that I am watching some other movie, not Narnia, that the whole thing was some silly mistake. I was really disappointed and don't know what to think of it at all.I am just hoping that someone will make a remake of the movies in the way that corresponds with the plot of those awesome books and forget what I saw today in the cinema even if I'd have to wait for decades.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

Remember, this story is a lesson in growing up, treating people with respect and following the truth within one's heart! Shame on Disney for forgetting these ideals and placing them well below profits.In all the movie was great and leaves me anxious for The Silver Chair...

219,lander5,The Book is Always Better But Great Adaptation,10,3 June 2011,"This adaptation is FAR better than the last Narnia movie, Prince Caspian.I rated it 10 stars for several reasons. 1) The actor playing Eustace is hysterical. I laughed through the entire movie. He plays a pompous little boy who acts as though he is dragged down by constant nonsense and tomfoolery. His quest about he British console is lol funny. 2) The imagery was beautiful. The dragon was good. Sometimes, these sorts of things become laughable in fantasy movies. I think this one will stand the test of time, at least in the foreseeable future (unlike the werewolf in HP3) 3) These books were written by C.S. Lewis. Often parts of these books are based on Christian themes and allegory. I was pleased that in this adaptation they didn't shy away from it. I especially liked the Aslan line to Lucy, ""In your world, I have another Name. You must learn to know me by it. That was the very reason you were brought to Narnia: that by knowing me here for a little, you may know Me better there."" Also, did anyone notice the painting of the ship was hung on a cross? Pretty cool.Now, for the cons, the movie script has obviously altered the original story quite a bit, i.e. the green mist/swords. Obviously, this was not a part of the original story. However, I am okay with it. It didn't drastically ruin the themes/plot of the story. The mist was merely a visual way to show sin/evil. I realize some people probably wouldn't have gotten the connection without this visual.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
220,austint9110,Decent Adaptation; Still A Great Film,7,11 December 2010,"Having just finished the book (for the 2nd time) minutes before the showing, the details of the Dawn Treader's adventures were fresh in my mind. While i did not expect the movie to followed the book perfectly, I was still a bit put off by the alterations, such as Dark Island being the ""protagonist"" of the story with the added objective of collecting the 7 magical swords from the 7 expelled lords. There were also 2 characters added to the story which I was not crazy about, seeing as how they did not contribute the story, but rather took away from the main focus of the story. My last complaint is that the conflicts within the characters were quickly presented and resolved, over-glorified, or conflicts that occurred in one character in the book was presented in another character in the film. My biggest pet-peeve though was that the actor who voiced Reepicheep was not the same actor from Prince Caspian. As my friend put it, try to watch it as a separate entity. HOWEVER.. the movie was in and of itself spectacular. The magic was caught beautifully, the effects (while somewhat less impressive than the last 2 probably due to the loss of WETA and more resources spent on 3D) were enough to captivate, and the religious undertones Lewis presents in his books were just as present and heartwarming as ever. The use of lines throughout the movie also gave it a sense of realism and familiarity to those who read and lived the books.

I read the book as well beforehand and although there were differences, I feel that they were necessary to make the movie go smoothly and transition from scene to scene. It was magical, scenery was fantastic, and there was enough depth to carry it through to the end. Although Lucy and Edmund were older, it was just as in the book. This film was similar to the first in that it had more happier moments. There was action to keep you engaged, sadness to help you relate to the characters, humorous tidbits and triumphant moments to make for a great movie.

This movie is not dark or very violent at all. That may please some who have young children, but Prince Caspian had more real violence than the Voyage of the Dawn Treader.Plot- The plot was a little thin, but the same characters from the previous films really shinned with learning to act better on screen. 8/10 Effects- Narnia has always been a visual feast, and this movie continues the flow with the majority of the budget going to special effect shots. 10/10 Acting- The main characters did well for what they were required to do, but they don't really bring in adult into their shoes too well. The changing of the voice of the talking little mouse killed it for me. 7/10 Overall Worth of the movie- The movie in no way tried to innovate, but it used old concepts like what you think will appear were pretty solid fundamentals.

224,randykbh-926-772343,Loaded with Christian themes.,10,19 December 2010,"I was really impressed with this movie. More so than I was with the second movie, Prince Caspian. One reason is that this movie (as in the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe), was really loaded with Christian themes, where I didn't pick up on very many in Prince Caspian. I won't say what any of those themes were, because I don't want to give anything away to those who have not seen this movie yet. This movie is definitely a Christian alternative to Harry Potter. And like the two previous movies in the Narnia series, no profanity whatsoever. An excellent family movie. In addition to that, this movie surprised me in certain scenes. Things I didn't see coming. And still, Georgie Henley (Lucy) is so adorable. I recommend this film. I don't think it is as good as LWW, but, it's still getting a 10, to where I give Prince Caspian a 9.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
225,tarunerebel,"Decent film, but rather disappointing",6,18 December 2010,"I held high hopes for this film as the previous two movies were entertaining and epic for both children and adults. So I was extremely excited when I was to see the film in 3d. My excitement was extinguished after 30 minutes of watching the film.Pros: The music is as great and epic as ever. It adds to the atmosphere of traveling on the high seas. The characters of Eustace and Reepicheep were well acted and added great comic relief when needed. The subplot involving Rhince's search for his wife added depth to the film. The final scene at the world's end was gorgeous and exactly as imagined in the book. Ramandu's daughter was well portrayed. The dark island looked as evil as imagined and was a real treat to look at. The combining of Dragon island and death water island made perfect sense and cut out unnecessary time from the movie. The bout between Eustace and Reepicheep was fun and entertaining. The duffers were exactly as portrayed in the book. Cons: Drinian is not a jerk as portrayed in the movie, he is friendly, respectful, and kind. The movie gains no benefits from changing his character. The concept of the green mist was rather lame and unrealistic. Lord Bern is a successful and rich man, not some old prisoner of the pirates. Caspian is supposed to be looking for the seven lords, not seven swords. Where is Ramandu? Eustace does not stay a dragon for so long, Aslan cures him on the island. The battle between Eustace and the sea serpent had a sort of Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus feel to it. The sea serpent is supposed to be a real creature that they randomly encounter during their trip, not a figment of Edmund's imagination. Lord Rhoop wanted to get off the island as soon as possible. He should of been wanting to get on the ship, not shoo it away. How did the bracelet get off Dragon Eustace easily? It was supposed to pester him till the spell was broken. The conflict that Edmund had with Caspian on death water island seemed unreal. What was with the sea serpent tearing up his torso? Doing that should of killed it. The ""oppressor"" was quite a dull character and wasn't well acted.Overall, the movie is aimed toward the viewers who haven't read the books. The visuals are great, music is great, and the pacing is great. Die-hard fans of the books will dislike the film, as it was nothing like the book. The 3-D was rather disappointing as well and you would be better off watching it in 2D. Although I would rather be laying on my bed listening to the audio books, this movie is well worth your buck if you haven't read the book.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
226,robert-trca,Better than what I expected...,8,18 December 2010,"I am gonna shoot straight, this ""episode"" of the Narnian Chronicles was my least favorite book. However, luckily for me, it was the book and not the movie that rang of mediocrity. During the credits, an important line roles, BASED on the book. I have read hundreds of reviews slamming this movie because it is ""not like the book."" However, I disagree. The director used the good parts of this book; the meaty parts. At the same time, he had to speed up the plot: (who wants to go to a 4 hour movie, where there is one 5 minute fight scene in the beginning?) Also, I loved how the director moved back to the original meaning of the books. The first two movies were ""feel good"" movies, almost Disney-like in nature (heaven forbid). However the questions posed and answered, primarily about ""Aslan's country"" were intriguing and startlingly Christian, the way the books were in the beginning. I thought there could have been a deeper plot, however I am pleased and glad to have seen this movie. Favorite movie? No. One worth seeing? Definitely.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
227,cocobirdi,Insulting to Fans of the Book,1,18 December 2010,"As a reader who grew up on this series - read through it so many times, in fact, that I have had to buy several sets as I wore them out - and as a very happy supporter of the movie series up until now, I was horrified with the film. The first two movies were happily accurate, and I've watched them over and over. But this... this is not the Dawn Treader. This is some storyline that seems as though someone came up with it after reading a vague outline of the story some 20 years ago and has now tried to recreate it from memory, but failed. The mist? Really? That was a contained island with nothing in it but nightmares and one waterlogged lord, not some evil darkness seeking to take over the world, lurking and tempting and generally being a nuisance. And when they left it, just turned around and left it, it was gone. Poof, over and done. And suddenly it's the most important part of the movie? The plot line as it stands leaves much to be desired, utterly weaker than the previous two. And I don't blame them at all, because they weren't given much to work with, but the acting had definitely deteriorated. The musical score, so beautiful, heroic, and moving in the previous two, was not memorable at all. The movie in general was an insane disappointment. One would think that after the failure in the Golden Compass's plot ""liberties"" that they would know better than to take a much MORE beloved book and twiddle their fingers in it. I would hate to see this series fail before we finally get to see accurate interpretations of the later books, and maybe even someday, dare I say it, the Magician's Nephew?! And can someone explain to me why suddenly nobody is Spanish, including Caspian with his previously sexy accent? I had to go check to make sure he was even the same actor! Fail. Just... Fail. Please, try again, before Lucy and Edmond get too old. Please, please, redo, sticking to the quality, beauty, and accuracy of the previous ones.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
228,farihamorsh,Crap.,2,21 December 2010,"I have watched this film recently in 3D. Firstly, I do not recommend anyone to watch this in 3D as there's not much difference between 3D and 2D. I actually took off the 3D glasses and apparently it makes no huge difference on most of the scene- the glasses only makes the film seems darker. Secondly, the cinematography is crap. Yes, crap. It makes me feel dizzy to be honest. Its chaos. Thirdly, as I did not read the books: the plot doesn't really make sense as there are a lot of jumping. Overall, I would not recommend anyone to watch this film. I hope this review helps you to decide as its certainly doesn't worth the 8 pound I've paid to watch it. xx",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
229,booth_stephanie,Great for all ages! I'm 27 and I enjoyed it.,10,22 December 2010,"""The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" is the best by far. So much is begin said and lessons to learn in this movie. C.S. Lewis was such a great Christian writer, with a very imaginative mind. He had a very creative way of him showing who God is by using a Lion to display that, so that others may read, watch and come to know him. I love reading his books, and the movie was just as good. I have watched Narnia cartoons growing up and love it always. In this movie, I love how Peter, and Lucy got to stand out more and come to love themselves and accept the position they were in, that they are all special and place in this world for a reason. This is a great movie for all to watch.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
230,a-emilysm,Very poor.,1,24 December 2010,"The third video installment of the Chronicles of Narnia, the Voyage of the Dawn Treader, was a very poor depiction of the story as was written by C. S. Lewis. Many elements were added to the story, altering it so drastically that it no longer deserved to hold the title ""the Voyage of the Dawn Treader."" The acting abilities among the cast were all very good, as well as the graphics and special effects, but the altered story was rather dull. The humor aspects and magical wonders would entertain small children, (though some scenes may frighten them) but older viewers may be able to see the poor story line as it struggles to entertain viewers for a long amount of time.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

I am a huge fan of the Narnia series and after being disappointed by Prince Caspian, I was a little nervous about this one. I was not disappointed at all! It had a great combination of humor, action, and feeling. It also had great acting, especially by Eustace(Will Poulter). It had great characterization, especially of Reepecheep. The story was preserved and only enhanced a little bit to make the story more fitting to a movie.No profanity and no sex make this movie family friendly. The ending scene was extremely well-done and the cinematography and music enhanced the film.Over all this movie was great. 10 out of 10 all the way!!",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
233,rtpjpw,".Excellent production, true to book",10,28 December 2010,"We saw this in 3D. it did give added effect to the movie. However, the storyline and characters are such that I think it would be most enjoyable even without 3-d. i do think the l3D could have been more dramatic; However, I did still appreciate seeing it in 3 D. The special effects were most convincing and beautiful to watch. This was an excellent movie, true to the book, produced with excellence. The chronicles of Narnis books give much for producers to work with- excellence of storyline, thought provoking,and plenty of material for special effects. . The characters and story were convincing. Your interest is kept throughout the movie. I found at times I was gripping my husbands hand. If you are open to the double or deeper or extended meaning you will be thrilled. I'm so thrilled to see an excellent production of excellent writing that is decent and above board and most appealing and interesting at the same time.

The scenes with Eustace in are really funny and half the cinema were laughing when I went to see it. The special effects are amazing and half the time I forgot that Reepicheep wasn't a real mouse! I like how the film shows how Edmund feels about being second best all the time and how Lucy feels about not being as pretty as Susan. It reflects true elements of life for teenagers nowadays whilst still keeping the magical element about it at the same time. I watched the film both in 3D and 2D but I didn't really see a difference between the two, so I would recommend seeing it in 2D to save money! My whole family enjoyed the film and I will be definitely be recommending this film to all my friends.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
235,wjq_mx3,Quality rendition of a fantastic book in a new media.,10,29 December 2010,"No movie written has been a visual depiction of the book on which it was based. The book leaves the picture for the audience to determine himself while a movie allows the imagination to sit idly by and coast through the plot and scenes. These books have been loved and studied for decades and the movie simply brings the fantastic story into a new media for many people who simply lack the patience or motivation to read the book. So while the picture on screen may not be the same image cast by everyone who read these novels, the main points the author intended to be shared have been very effectively reproduced. C. S. Lewis' Narnia stories were never intended to be simply a new world or a new dimension for people to ponder, but a parable, if you will. Everything in the books is designed to point to deep and real things in the lives of individuals in the real world, so unlike ""Avatar"", you don't have to miss the characters or the environment once you leave the theatre, but be encouraged towards real and present things in the world around you. Well done, because people will come to know the works and purpose of C. S. Lewis' writing career as a result of producing them in this media.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

237,kono88,"Great improvement in style, with one major setback",8,5 January 2011,"I am close to giving Voyage of the Dawn Treader 9 out of 10 simply because of how thrilled I was with the changes I found from the first two movies.I have enjoyed both of the other movies, but still felt disappointed by how there were many points that they would feel too cheesy. At first, aside from a couple things near the end of Prince Caspian, I was not sure what did this. After watching Voyage of the Dawn Treader, I found what was bothering me in the first film.They had been trying to make the series with the ""historic"" style that is in Lord of the Rings. The problem is when you have the entire film made up of these creatures from mythology that are ""way out there"", you don't have much to make it feel more ""realistic"". Where as the dwarfs, elves, and, to an extent, even the goblins in Lord of the Rings have a very human shape and form, and the story itself has much more history to put in it.What I love about Voyage of the Dawn Treader is that it is made with a style to place it further in the fantasy genre, which makes the symbolism and mythology fit better in the story and gives these aspects the kind of life that realism gave to the land of Middle-Earth. With the way the film was shot (its more mythological style and its both clear and hidden messages) it made all of the unrealistic parts of the film fit in and not be as corny or out of place as they were in the other films.The one problem that makes it an 8 and not a 9 or 10 is what I am very disappointed in. At under 2 hours the length of the film was far too short. With how much is in the story and how many different lands it takes place in, the movie did not have enough time to put the entire story together and even cuts a few themes short.If they can continue with this style and simply put a little more into it, The Silver Chair could turn out to be the best of the series.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

239,haveitson27,A Great Adventure,7,10 November 2012,"When I went to go see this movie I was not sure what to expect. I had a lots of mixed feelings, and the only reason I saw it was because my girl friend really wanted to see it :) . Well I was not disappointed. The voyage they take is really an adventure. The sense of adventure combined with great effects and action scenes makes this a very entertaining movie. But most importantly it's a great family movie, with a positive message. I am not the person to usually watch this genre of film but when I left the theater I could not say I did not enjoy the movie. I do wish there could have been a few scenes that would make this movie more epic, or larger, if you know what I mean.I feel that although there was Character development, mostly in the Character Eustace, there could have been more. I would have liked to see more of a deeper change in the characters, something a little more serious then behavioral problems. Also I feel if the journey would have been slowed down a bit, maybe added a few more days or obstacles, the sense of adventure would have been bigger and more engaging. I usually would not confess this out loud but I also think this movie would be even better if it had a few more really emotional or sad scenes in it, rather then just the sad goodbyes.Over all this was a great entertaining movie. A very important factor to me that helps this movie score high is that fact that it has a good positive message. The symbolism and metaphors are great.

240,lhenry26,"Mostly bad, unfortunately",5,19 December 2010,"I realize this is a book that needs changes in order to work on film. Unfortunately, the changes need to improve the story which did not happen in this film. The ideas of adding the 7 swords and having the Dark Island be at the climax of the story were reasonable, but the green mist as all evil incarnate was not only poorly explained but ended up looking just plain dumb. Having Jadis, the White Witch return was confusing too, and it would have been better to have her be the villain and more true to the spirit of the books, if not strictly canon. Some small things were distracting too. The surviving lords looked like characters out of Monty Python's Life of Brian. The CGI scenes were did not look as realistic as we have come to expect, for example during Edmund's battle with the sea serpent. Finally, I felt the various battle scenes were really poorly choreographed and edited. What a shame, since they were a real strength of both previous films. On the other had I thought there were a lot of redeeming features, number one being Will Pouter, Eustace. He was terrific maybe a little more sympathetic that the character in the book, but it worked beautifully. The relationship between Eustrace and Reepicheep was fantastic and it worked even when Eustace was a dragon. The rest of the cast was fine and thank goodness, Caspian did not have that Inigo Montoya accent this go round. I thought the Dufflepuds and the Magic Book scenes were great. Lucy's jealousy of Susan was well done - almost overdone, but not quite. All in all, it was not of the quality of either of the previous films, and could have been a lot better, but had enough going for it that I did have a fair amount of enjoyment as I watched.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and thought it faithful to what I perceive as Lewis's intentions with his adventures in Narnia. There is loads of wonderful symbolism (without, in my opinion, excessive cheesiness) and it lead to good conversation with my son following the movie. The best of the Narnia movies, keeping with the spirit if not the plot of the Chronicles and Mr. Lewis.

I chose to view the movie without any preconceived ideas. It has been many years since I read the book and I have the British versions at home (which I personally love). On an entertainment level, this was wonderful. My son loved the dragon, my youngest daughter's friend loved it and the rest of us thoroughly enjoyed it. I didn't view this movie as like the others since the stories are vastly different, esp. in the book. It surprised me that I got teary at the end. My advice, enjoy the movie for what it is. If you read the book and expect it to adhere strictly to it, you will be disappointed. If you haven't, just enjoy the ride. Aside from some scary points for younger viewers, it is a great ride. Just enjoy it. For those who said there was no plot and couldn't follow it, I had no problem there. A movie will never fit the book perfectly. If it does, it's either a lie to begin with or boring.

245,Plaid_Blood,The Chronicles of Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader Review,5,14 December 2010,"I just need to get this out of my system...(Potential Spoilers for those who have not read the book or seen the book) The Chronicles of Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader was mediocre at best.THE BAD:In terms of plot, it was just awful. The team spends the whole time chasing this fart gas around the least appealing edges of Narnia, only to find out the source of it was ""their fear"".....Oooooooooooh. The acting of the Lucy and Edmond was elementary, showing they have not excelled in the least. Ben Barnes played a fairly good Caspian again. The writing was nothing special with prominent contrived dialogue. A sub-plot that was weak was Lucy's desire to look like her older sister....I don't know if anyone has noticed, but they look pretty freaking similar already, so what was the point of complaining.The action was not nearly as good as the first two in anyway possible. Characters were underdeveloped and the ending was contingent on Ripicheep's entrance to Aslan's Land (Heaven), which wasn't very effectively done seeing how Ripicheep, as cool as he is, did not have any emotional connections with the audience. The meaning was so formulaic and generic which overpowers an ailing plot. There were too many religious overtones (i.e. Aslan's Land, Aslan saying he's known as God in the real world). Just because you have a prominent meaning, as bad as it can be, does not mean you can sacrifice plot...that is not what movies are about. A final note on the downfalls of this movie, is it did not have the magical Narnia we all know and love, it just didn't. So if you the plot sucked, the setting sucked, the acting sucked, the writing sucked, and the meaning was pretty generic, how can this be a good movie. Debate me on that, but you lose that battle, you lose that battle 9 times out of 10.THE GOOD: Some of the visuals were decent and contained a lot of detail. Will Poulter had a stunning performance as Eustace with one of the best line deliveries I've ever seen from someone his age. Simon Pegg's voice acting was awesome. The music was good and fit nicely as always. Various scenes were well executed (i.e. The gold cave scene, the sea serpent scene, the entrance and exit to and from Narnia). This was a very faithful adaptation of the book. The 3D wasn't terrible.THE BOTTOM LINE: This was the weakest Narnia of the 3 movies, and that is coming from someone who adored the first two. Perhaps I'm just growing up, or perhaps I'm just becoming more insightful. The bad overpowered the good, but that being said, this movie is still worth a watch for a viewer to concoct their own opinion. Even though I found this to be the worst portrayal of Narnia, it still has a lot of the good vibes that the first two had, so if you like the Narnia series, see this one for yourself. It was a mediocre movie but remains a faithful adaptation of the book.***This was a personal and opinionated response, but I think I gave enough supporting evidence to ensure the validity of my word.",The Chronicles of Narnia - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
