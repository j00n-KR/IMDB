0,TheLittleSongbird,More miserly than Getty himself,5,13 January 2018,"Saw 'All the Money in the World' due to that its subject is incredibly interesting. Ridley Scott has also some great films ('Alien' and 'Blade Runner' especially are masterpieces of their genre), the cast is a talented one (particularly Michelle Williams and Christopher Plummer) and the trailer was one of the best of the year.It saddens me to say this, but 'All the Money in the World' is really not one of Scott's best and doesn't do this story justice. By all means not a terrible film, but 'All the Money in the World' is a classic instance of the trailer being much better than the film, other than the production values and some of the acting very little of what made the trailer as good as it was translated in the film. 'All the Money in the World' does have good things. Other than some hasty, artificial-looking moments (so understandably those scenes were going to be rushed due to having to be done at last minute) to accommodate original star Kevin Spacey's last minute replacement Christopher Plummer, it is a well made film. It is very slickly photographed, evocatively designed and the drabness and darkness suited the mood perfectly. The music has moments of haunting intensity but doesn't overbear things while still having presence. Regarding Scott's direction, it is competent on the most part, excelling in the visuals and the direction of Williams and Plummer. You would never guess that Plummer was not the original choice for Getty and was brought in as last resort to replace Spacey, only some of the way the re-done scenes were done betrayed this but honestly this is ignorable as a flaw because it was understandable considering the circumstances. Judging from his powerhouse performance as this miserly and very enigmatic man, one would think actually that he was the original star all the time. Williams is similarly brilliant, a raw intensely heart-breaking portrayal, where every kind of emotion is brought out and one of very few things in the film that shows any urgency or emotional impact for the situation. Romain Duris does his best but the writing works against him. Not all the cast work. Mark Wahlberg just doesn't fit and takes one of the setting, also succeeding in making Chase bland and annoying. Charlie Plummer doesn't make one empathise with him much and plays John Paul in too bratty and one-dimensional a way. Those playing the villains suffer the worst of the writing, they are all sketchy ciphers that are never fully fleshed out and despite their increasing brutality there is nothing menacing about them. The script is a really big problem here. Very rambling, some of it adding very little, and sometimes repetitive. It barely scratches the surface and never brings out the substance underneath, although Plummer and Williams do their absolute best to bring this out and succeed because they are such conscientious actors. This dilutes any emotional impact or tension completely. Pacing also poses as just as big a problem. It is incredibly sluggish and too many scenes feel like over-stretched padding. The story is just non-stop emptiness and is very disjointed. The scenes with Williams and those with Plummer and the subplot with the captors and John Paul feel like two different films, sometimes confusingly done. The ending should have ended the film with a bang, instead 'All the Money in the World' had already petered out too early and provides a climax that is laboured, contrived and nonsensical (Scott's direction is also at its worst).Overall, not a waste but very underwhelming considering the talent and the story. Getty may have been a notorious miser, the film manages to be more miserly than him, an unheard of feat one would think but it happened here. 5/10 Bethany Cox",All the Money in the World
1,Leofwine_draca,Ponderous,4,28 September 2020,"ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD is a slow and ponderous retelling of the Getty kidnapping from the normally reliable Ridley Scott. This is a film that goes on forever and takes ages to get anywhere. The emphasis is on characters but they're all rather predictable and not at all interesting, from Michelle Williams as the conflicted daughter to Mark Wahlberg as the investigator. Christopher Plummer has the best role as the old miser but really doesn't have too much to do or say, and having just finished it I can't help but wonder what the point of it all was.",All the Money in the World
2,SnoopyStyle,scandal,6,9 May 2018,"It's 1973. One night, 16 year old John Paul Getty III is kidnapped off the streets of Rome. The kidnappers want $17 million. His mother Gail (Michelle Williams) has nothing. Her ex-husband is a drug addict but it's ex-father-in-law, Jean Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer), who is the richest man in the world. JPG is a ruthless oil baron and a penny pinching miser. He puts his fixer Fletcher Chase (Mark Wahlberg) on the case.This movie will always be more known for the controversy from Kevin Spacey as the original JPG. It's not a bad movie but it's not good enough to overtake the behind-the-scene scandal. Quite frankly, Christopher Plummer is a better choice for the role. He needs to be a Scrooge, powerful without the anger. Spacey would probably take it too far. Michelle Williams does solid work as always. She's that good. On the other hand, Wahlberg continues to insists on being the hero of piece which is very annoying. He takes it too far. In one scene, he confronts Getty and I actually felt bad for the bastard. He diminishes the picture. I also note that there is TV show about the same historical drama and I really like that show. This is solid work but the history of this movie will always start with the scandal.",All the Money in the World
3,Prismark10,The ugly side of cash,6,27 March 2018,"Ridley Scott's All the Money in the World is going to be known for its last minute re-shoots when one of its star Kevin Spacey was replaced at the last minute by Christopher Plummer. It led to the gag that when a film runs into trouble; have the telephone number of the emergency Plummer!Jean Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer) had built an oil empire that led him to become the richest man in the world. He was also a miser, washing his own smalls in hotel bathrooms rather then pay for it to be cleaned in the hotel launderette. His mansion in England had a telephone box installed as visitors were racking up huge phone bills.For the Getty's money is not the answer to all problems. His son John Paul Getty descended into drugs and alcoholism. His grandson John Paul Getty III (Charlie Plummer) lived a Bohemian lifestyle in Rome and was kidnapped in 1973. A ransom of $17 million dollar was demanded. Getty refused to pay. He did not want to set a precedent that would put his other relatives in danger.The story is about Gail Harris (Michelle Williams) the boy's mother estranged from the Getty family trying to get the grandfather to pay the ransom while holding off accusations that the kidnapping might be staged. Getty meanwhile hires a security expert and former CIA operative Fletcher Chase (Mark Wahlberg) to look closely into the kidnapping, help out Harris and enter into negotiations with the kidnappers.The film starts out brightly. It is established early on that despite his wealth, the Gettys are a troubled family and the head of the family is not only a miser but just plain mean. Getty knows everyone has a price, it just a case of negotiating to the right and in his case the lowest price.The dramatic impact gets lost as the film goes on. It is too long. The boy remains kidnapped, eventually he is tortured. Grandfather would rather buy a work of art than pay the ransom. Harris and Chase run around Rome looking for leads and persuading Getty to stump up the money.All the Money in the World is rather hollow as a drama, the quickly worked re-shoots were fantastically inserted though.",All the Money in the World
4,nogodnomasters,"If you can count your money, you're not a billionaire.",6,29 January 2018,"The film is inspired by the kidnapping and ransom of Paul Getty (Charlie Plummer) the grandson of J. Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer). The film opens with background information on the Getty empire and we quickly learn that JP would never get ""Father of the Year"" award as he is obsessed with collecting items and watching the ticker tape...what traders did before computers. Paul's mother Gail (Michelle Williams) was the contact person for the ransom. She was broke and basically disowned. The film takes place in 1973. There is a message in the film on us and the super rich or maybe on Italians being criminals, I'm not really sure. I didn't like any of the characters. They could have shot more of them. I am waiting for the Kevin Spacey version.Guide: F-word. Implied sex. No nudity.",All the Money in the World
5,kosmasp,Things money can't buy,8,12 April 2018,"You may or may not be aware of the fact that Christopher Plummer came on board after Kevin Spacey had to go amidst controversy (sexual allegations from the past). So bring in Christopher Plummer - and you may try to think at times how Kevin might have done the same thing. Try not to and instead enjoy the movie as it is.Because you could also think about pay inequality during the re-shoots. The movie itself might have gotten some push through the controversy or it might have gotten people annoyed. I know I wanted to watch it anyway. And Ridley Scott is always a guarantee for quality, at least on the technical side. But I'd argue the story works here too. It may feel a bit cold and distant, but that's on purpose ...",All the Money in the World
6,classicsoncall,"""When a man becomes wealthy, he has to deal with the problems of freedom.""",7,24 October 2019,"Hard to believe someone as rich as John Paul Getty would be as miserly as to refuse to pay a ransom for his own grandchild. However I am convinced that paying that ransom would have elicited another kidnapping, whether of his own kin or some other rich billionaire's family. Such is the sentiment stated by the elder Getty (Christopher Plummer) in my summary line, spoken to his premier negotiator and fixer, Fletcher Chace (Mark Wahlberg). Other reviews here appear to be unkindly to Wahlberg's performance, but I thought he did a credible job. It was reassuring that his character did not develop into a love interest for Gail Harris Getty (Michelle Williams), mother of the kidnapped Paul Getty (Charlie Plummer, no relation to the senior Plummer). It was curious to observe how the original kidnappers folded when their prospect of a major windfall began to evaporate, thereby 'selling' their interest in young Paul for whatever they could get. Michelle Williams is particularly effective in the story as the principled and strong willed woman who never despairs of losing her son, though periodically shaken by the events of Paul's kidnapping. Ultimately, and apart from the successful outcome regarding Paul's fate, the story is an object lesson to the extent that not even the richest person in the world has enough money to depart this mortal coil alive, much less to be in a position to take it with you when you go.",All the Money in the World
7,lee_eisenberg,that was one screwed-up family,10,31 March 2019,"Leading up to its release, Ridley Scott's ""All the Money in the World"" made news for the reshooting of Kevin Spacey's scenes with Christopher Plummer after Spacey got MeToo'd, and for the exorbitant amount of money paid to Mark Wahlberg (some people implied that the movie's title referred to how much Wahlberg made from starring in it). Thankfully, he donated his paycheck to the Time's Up movement.But now I'll focus on the movie itself. You've probably heard about how it focuses on the kidnapping of J. Paul Getty's grandson. Overall, what it shows is how there was no love in that family. Getty remained a cold, avaricious creep to the end, and his daughter-in-law (Michelle Williams) was the only member of the family who made any effort to rescue her son. Without a doubt, Williams - affecting an accent - carries the movie, but Plummer (in an Academy Award-nominated role) puts his all into portraying the stingy Getty; and to think that he filmed the role on such short notice!I definitely recommend it.",All the Money in the World
8,jboothmillard,All the Money in the World,6,21 January 2018,"This movie was making headlines before it had even been completed or released, because of the controversy surrounding the original star, and then it was getting attention during Awards Season, so I wasn't going to miss it, from Golden Globe nominated director Sir Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Gladiator, The Martian). Basically set in in 1973, 16-year-old John Paul Getty III, known as ""Paul"" (Charlie Plummer) is in Rome, he is the grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Christopher Plummer), at the time the richest man in the world. Paul is kidnapped by an organised crime ring, the kidnappers demand a ransom of $17 million, his parents Gail Harris (Golden Globe nominated Michelle Williams) and John Paul Getty II (Andrew Buchan) were divorced in 1964, Gail refused any money in exchange for full custody of her children. Therefore, she does not have the means to pay the ransom, so she travels to the Getty's estate to beseech Paul's grandfather to pay, but he refuses, stating it would encourage further kidnappings on other family members. The media picks up on the story, many believe that Gail is rich herself and blame her for the refusal to pay the ransom, meanwhile, Getty asks his advisor, former CIA operative and negotiator Fletcher Chase (Mark Wahlberg), to investigate the case and secure Paul's release. In a remote location in Italy, Paul is held captive, initially his captors, particularly Cinquanta (Romain Duris), are tolerant with because, because he is quiet and submissive, but things get increasingly tense as weeks go by and the ransom is not being paid, far longer than the abductors had anticipated. Winter approaches, arguments arise over whether to move Paul to a new location, their hideout is not suitable for cold conditions, then one of the kidnappers accidentally shows his face to Paul. One of the others kills the unmasked captor for his foolish mistake, he is burned, and his disfigured body is discovered in a river, investigators assume it is Paul's body, but Gail asked to identify the body confirms it is not her son. Using the found body as a lead, Chase pinpoints the hideout where Paul is being held, a raid is conducted, and several kidnappers are killed, but Paul is no longer there, he has been sold on to a new crime organisation. The new captors are much more brutal towards Paul and are more aggressive in their negotiating with the Getty family to pay the money, after repeated negotiations with Gail and Chase, and frustration for the length of time it is taking, they lower the ransom to $4 million. Getty finally decides to contribute to the ransom, but only $1 million, the maximum amount that is tax deductible, and he will only agree to do so if Gail signs a legal document waiving her parental rights to Paul and her other children, giving them to her ex-husband, she reluctantly agrees and signs. Since more weeks go by without the ransom being paid, the kidnappers decide to cut off Paul's right ear and mail it to a newspaper, claiming that they will continue mutilating him until they get the money. An exasperated Chase scolds Getty, who finally relents and agrees to pay the full ransom, also voiding the parental agreement with Gail, she and Chase are given specific instructions of where to go in Italy to drop off the money, they leave it in a remote location and will collect Paul from a construction site. However, a frightened Paul runs away from the site to the nearest town, miles away, meanwhile the captors realise Chase has not kept his word and police are surrounding them, angry they decide to find and kill Paul. Chase, Gail and the captors reach the town Paul is hiding in, one of the kidnappers finds Paul first, but Cinquanta attacks him and allows Paul to escape, Chase and Gail find Paul and safely smuggle him out of the country. Getty dies at his home from cardiovascular disease, he leaves a fortune to his grandchildren, which Gail will manage until they are of age, also Getty's company was set up as a charitable fund, meaning his income was tax-free and not spendable, he invested much of his money in paintings, sculptures and other artefacts, Gail organises these to go on sale, many reside in the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. Also starring Timothy Hutton as Oswald Hinge and Marco Leonardi as Mammoliti. Kevin Spacey had already finished filming, but then he was accused of numerous alleged sexual assaults, so Christopher Plummer was a last-minute replacement to replace him and refilm all his scenes, to be honest, I can't imagine it the other way. Plummer gives a great performance as the curmudgeonly multi-billionaire, Williams is relatively good, and Wahlberg gives good support. It is an interesting true story that is easy to follow, it perhaps could have delivered a little better in terms of the real events, but there are enough moments that keep you hooked, especially the ear cutting scene, all in all it's a worthwhile crime thriller. Good!",All the Money in the World
9,blanche-2,distasteful crowd,6,13 September 2018,"I have to agree with other posters - Michelle Williams stole this film; it's remarkable she was not nominated for an Oscar. And someone said they had no understanding why Mark Wahlberg was cast in a non-action film.
I have no idea why he's cast in anything, and I never have.I found this film slow-moving with a reprehensible character in the person of J. Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer). Plummer is always wonderful, and he was here as well - cold, petty, playing a man much more interested in works of art and building another home than he is in the welfare of his grandson.The story of the Getty kidnapping is horrible, and Paul Getty actually never recovered, dying at age 54. One way or another, J. Paul Getty managed to do a number on his entire family. He yelled at one of his wives for spending too much money on treatment for their blind son; when the boy died at the age of 12, Getty, no longer with his wife, didn't attend the funeral.See this for Michelle Williams' performance; she's really terrific.",All the Money in the World
10,Quinoa1984,another good Ridley Scott production with one major piece of film history attached immediately,7,7 January 2018,"This is.. Good. Sometimes quite good when the focus is on Michelle Williams (one of the best performances and characters of the year) or Christopher Plummer (this Beginners and The Insider give a mammoth impression of what this man can do). ...Mark Wahlberg is just ..... serviceable and another actor couldve brought... I don't know *something* else to what is a two dimensional role. They're surrounded by believable though mostly unremarkable Italians (although I did like the guy who sorta-kinda befriended Paul Betty).While I definitely applaud Scott and co for a completely seamless job on what, uh, had to be done in the past several weeks, I think people years from now - without all that context - will fund another well made, sometimes surprising, but ultimately by the books thriller that for all its strong qualities is lump in with films he's made like Body of Lies or White Squall or even Robin Hood, movies that have a few notable performances and set pieces, and he understands drama and conflict and all that, but something is missing at the script level. It's like... Things keep happening, but the dialog is rote (this may be a way to explain why Williams and Plummer excel where Wahlbeth doesn't: it's not only the characters but also finding a way to elevate what's on the page).It also doesnt help that after almost two hours where (for someone like me who didn't know at all about this story) there were genuine turns do take one by surprise, the climax smacks of BS: I just don't buy how it flows together, and what Scott cuts to is meant to be some big ironic contrast and it takes away from the core dramatic thrust. To put it another way, when the credits started and the ""Some incidents may have been changed for dramatic purposes"" text came up I wanted to tell ""holy no s***, Batman?!""So it's good. I wish it were... Better somehow.",All the Money in the World
11,grantss,Intriguing drama,8,28 October 2018,"1973. J Paul Getty is the wealthiest man in the world. His grandson, John Paul Getty III, is kidnapped in Italy and his kidnappers demand a ransom of USD 17m. Getty refuses to pay, as giving in to their demands will encourage the kidnapping of his grandchildren. Despite his wealth, he is rather miserly. It is up to the boy's mother to try to find a way to get her son back.Great drama, based on a true story. Very intriguing with many twists and turns in the story line. The primary focus is on what will happen to Getty jr but there's also this great standoff between his grandfather and his mother.The miserliness of J Paul Getty I is laid on a bit thick, but apparently it's accurate! We do at least get the backstory of how he built his fortune, and his reasoning for being so thrifty, which does allow some engagement with his character.On that note, Christopher Plummer is great as J Paul Getty. Plummer got a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance. At 88 he became the oldest nominee for an acting Oscar.Great work too from Michelle Williams as the mother, Gail Harris/Getty. Commanding performance from her.Out of place amongst such accomplished actors is Mark Wahlberg. He is fine for action roles, and Ridley Scott tries to turn him into an action man here, but his character here was more than a simple man of action, requiring some depth. That's not what he's good at, and it shows. He looks like an amateur when appearing with Michelle Williams.",All the Money in the World
12,george.schmidt,Plummer and Williams excel in Scott's shrewd gamble payoff,8,7 January 2018,"ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD (2017) *** Michelle Williams, Christopher Plummer, Mark Wahlberg, Romain Duris, Timothy Hutton, Charlie Plummer, Andrew Buchan. Based on the true story of the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III (Plummer, the younger and no relation to Plummer the elder) - whose grandfather John Paul Getty (Plummer the elder at his best) proved to be a force to be reckoned with (not budging one iota in the ransom demands) the kidnappers and his daughter-in-law Gail Harris (Williams understated brilliance) going to no ends to have her son returned at any cost. Filmmaker Scott keeps the film running like a well-oiled machine and took upon the self-inflicted Herculean effort to re-shoot the film by replacing scandal-plagued Kevin Spacey (originally starring as the billionaire) with Plummer and shrewdly paying off by not hedging his bets.",All the Money in the World
13,neil-476,Far too long,7,1 May 2018,"16 year old Paul Getty III is kidnapped in Rome. A $17 million ransom is demanded. Paul's mother wants her ex-father-in-law, the richest man in the world, to pay the ransom: he refuses. Much jockeying for position ensues, between various kidnappers, police and the Gettys, and between Mom and Getty Senior.There are two excellent elements in this film. They are Michelle Williams as Paul Getty's mother, and Christopher Plummer (subbing for the disgraced Kevin Spacey) as Getty Sr. Plummer cleverly doesn't make Getty a complete monster, merely someone who is unable to uncouple himself from his avaricious ambition enough to allow his love for his family to actually mean anything. Michelle Williams is one of the most powerful young actresses on film, again.It's a shame the film fails to make anything very much of the tension inherent in this story, notwithstanding that we know the resolution. The screenplay isn't particularly good, and Ridley Scott does not direct well.
Mark Wahlberg does as well as he can with a part which does not play to his strengths.The film would have been improved by having at least 30 minutes cut from the 140 minutes running time.",All the Money in the World
14,evanston_dad,Passionless,6,31 December 2017,"The true story this film recreates could and should have made a crackling movie, but instead Ridley Scott delivers a serviceable film that hits all of its marks but feels rather bloodless on screen.As pretty much everyone knows, Christopher Plummer was pulled in at the last minute to play J. Paul Getty, reshooting all of the scenes previously featuring Kevin Spacey in a performance we will now never see thanks to the sexual harassment scandal that emerged about him. Getty refuses to pay the ransom when his grandson is kidnapped, much to the anger and frustration of his ex-daughter-in-law, played by Michelle Williams in a performance that struggles to rise above the middle-brow film making. Mark Wahlberg is Getty's chief security man who's tasked with handling the situation and who eventually sours on Getty as he realizes what a cold-blooded monster he is. All of the performances are fine, but nothing about this movie really ever comes fully to life. Everything we're supposed to feel is telegraphed every step of the way, including the rather obvious moral that a life driven by the acquisition of money and stuff is bound to be an empty one. And the finale, which should be a nail biter, instead is clunky and awkward. Scott's direction in the rest of the film is uninspired but competent; his direction of the film's climax is just bad.Grade: B-",All the Money in the World
15,AlsExGal,True-story crime drama from director Ridley Scott was a logistical accomplishment,7,18 December 2019,"The film tells the story of the 1973 kidnapping of J. Paul Getty III (Charlie Plummer). He's held for an exorbitant ransom, but the kidnappers figure that since the young man's grandfather is J. Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer), the richest man in the world, he shouldn't have a problem paying it. They don't know Getty, a notorious cheapskate and skinflint who first refuses to pay any ransom, and then tries to negotiate it down to only an amount that is tax deductible. This naturally infuriates the boy's mother Gail Harris (Michelle Williams), who works with Getty family security chief Fletcher Chase (Mark Wahlberg) on getting the boy home safely.Director Scott keeps things moving swiftly along, offering various snapshot flashbacks to moments in the Getty family past to help illustrate the unique familial ties at play. Michelle Williams continues to show an amazing amount of range in her characterizations and accent work. Wahlberg has little to do, and is at times a distraction, although he gets a good ""telling 'em off"" scene near the end. Charlie Plummer (no relation to Christopher) is good as the unfortunate kidnap victim, and I was impressed with Romain Duris as a sympathetic kidnapper. But all eyes were on Christopher Plummer when this was released, thanks to all of the controversy.As most will recall, original co-star Kevin Spacey became the focus of much public outrage after accusations against him were made, and director Scott and the film's other producers made the unusual decision to completely reshoot his scenes with Plummer in the role, all mere weeks before the movie's scheduled release. Not only did they succeed, but I can't imagine Spacey being nearly as good as Plummer is as the soulless Getty patriarch. Plummer's Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor was viewed by many as acknowledging the logistical accomplishment, , as much as for the actual performance. But while I could argue that Plummer's is actually a co-leading role, I will say that his nomination was warranted for the acting job.",All the Money in the World
16,ferguson-6,your money or his life,7,22 December 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. The grandson of J Paul Getty, the wealthiest man in the world, was kidnapped while in Rome in 1973. That fascinating story holds more than enough drama for an engaging movie, and certainly did not need the notoriety or artistic challenges brought on by the Kevin Spacey scandal. With filming completed and a release date mere weeks away, director Ridley Scott made the decision to erase all evidence of Mr. Spacey's J Paul Getty, and replace him with Oscar winner Christopher Plummer. The ""do-over"" is nearly seamless and it's not a stretch to believe the second version turned out better than the first.The precisely descriptive titled 1995 John Pearson book ""Painfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J Paul Getty"" is adapted by screenwriter David Scarpa, and it's the storytelling instincts of Mr. Ridley, and remarkable acting of Mr. Plummer and Michelle Williams that keep us engaged for the 132 minute run time.16 year old John Paul Getty III is played by rising star Charlie Plummer (""Boardwalk Empire"", no relation to Christopher), and though this is the story of his kidnapping and violent torture, the movie mostly focuses on the contrasting personalities of his devoted mother Gail Harris (Michelle Williams) and his miserly grandfather J Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer), the wealthiest man in the world. She is a woman totally committed to her children while spurning the strings attached to family money. He, on the other hand, has devoted his life to money and winning, ignoring anything that might be construed as loyalty or compassion to family. Having just starred as Ebenezer Scrooge in THE MAN WHO INVENTED CHRISTMAS, this is just about the easiest transition an actor could hope for, given so little prep time for a new role.The billionaire Getty refuses to pay the ransom, instead dispatching his security specialist Fletcher Chase (Mark Wahlberg) to negotiate the boy's release. As a former CIA operative, Chase misreads both the situation with the abductors and the strength and determination of Gail. We get periodic looks at the captors and the environment where the grandson is being held. Romain Duris (THE BEAT THAT MY HEAR SKIPPED) is excellent as Cinquanta, the captor who spends the most time with the boy. The ""ear"" scene is explicit enough to elicit groans and shrieks from the audience, so be advised. ""We are not like you"" is what the younger Getty tells us as narrator, and he's right. The ultra-rich live in a different world than you and I (assuming you aren't one of ""them""), and that's never more clear than when the elder Getty explains his preference for things over people. While we never empathize with the rich miser, director Scott at least helps us understand what made him tick. To him, life was a negotiation and it's all about winning - though his definition of winning could be debated.The two octogenarians, Mr. Scott (80) and Mr. Plummer (88) work wonders with the outstanding Ms. Williams to make this a relatable story and captivating movie. The elder Getty died in 1976, two months to the day after Howard Hughes, while the grandson Getty had a massive drug overdose in 1981, and died in poor health in 2011, leaving behind his son, actor Balthazar Getty.",All the Money in the World
17,phd_travel,Gripping story - this movie is so much more than expected,10,25 January 2018,Gripping from start to finish the notorious kidnapping and release are far from straightforward. It's quite horrific and scary and not just the ordeal the boy faced. The intense frustration one feels at the colossal incompetence of the Italian police and the rife criminality in the country at the time are palpable. The warped sense of priorities the great JP Getty displayed is shocking till today. The rich are different.Christopher Plummer is actually very convincing in the role and in some way he is the lead actor. It was actually a good thing for the movie that he replaced Kevin Spacey because he is much more believable as the old billionaire. He has a patrician air and dignity that Kevin lacks. Eccentric and disfunctional rather than evil is the key here and Kevin is good at theatrically evil. Michelle Williams is surprisingly good here as the mother who actually gets things done. Mark Wahlberg is miscast. He sounds goofy and looks out of place as the more or less useless security staff of the Getty family.Surprisingly this is the best big budget movie of the year. Lady Bird and 3 Billboards are both very good indie movies but this is in a different category. Watch it.,All the Money in the World
18,Sylviastel,There's a purity to beautiful things that I've never been able to find in another human being.,8,16 July 2019,"Sir Ridley Scott reshot 20 scenes in 8 days with Christopher Plummer replacing the original actor as John Paul Getty. Ironically, Plummer was Scott's first choice to the play the role. It was a great task in replacing an actor in an important role but you wouldn't know the difference. It was based on a true story about billionaire tycoon John Paul Getty of Getty Oil and Gas who refused to pay for his grandson's ransom. Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg played the parents. Michelle Williams was perfect in her role as the worried mother and so was Wahblerg in his role. The cast was great and the film was well-done to reenact the actual historic events. The film is dramatic at times and yes based on true. I found it interesting to see how low Getty would go to not pay the ransom. When his grandson's ear turns up in the press after his second set of kidnappers, you can see that they mean business. The story was still sad overall. I wished they revealed more about what happened to the family.",All the Money in the World

Paul Getty, lacks tension. The pacing too, due to a Screenplay in no hurry to spike up the tension, lacks beat. The first-hour is bland, with only a few moments standing out. The second-hour is much better & even though the film gets a bit too violent in its final moments, the proceedings get interesting & leave you involved. But the Screenplay isn't power-packed enough & hence 'All the Money in the World' settles to be a mediocre film.Cinematography is marvelous. Editing needed more crispness, the film is a bit too long. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Make-Up is well-done. Performance-Wise: Christopher Plummer as J. Paul Getty, commands the screen. A part originally done by Spacey but removed immediately after being accused of perverse behavior, Plummer comes to Scott's rescue & embodies the unlikable billionaire with fire. Plummer, 88, is in great form, yet again. Michelle Williams as Gail Harris, Getty III's helpless mother, is affecting & convincing. Mark Wahlberg as Fletcher Chase, Gail and Getty's advisor and former CIA operative, plays a supporting part & excels. Charlie Plummer as John Paul Getty III, Jean Paul's grandson, is first-rate. Timothy Hutton as Oswald Hinge, Getty's attorney, is impressive, as ever. But its Romain Duris as Cinquanta, one of Getty lll's abductors, who steals the show! He is fantastic. Others lend remarkable support.On the whole, 'All the Money in the World' is a letdown by one of the finest storytellers we've ever had. Its, at best, an okay watch.",All the Money in the World

Making the case so interesting was that this boy was the grandson of an oil tycoon and rich billionaire named Jean Paul Getty(in a cold and care free performance from Christopher Plummer) and as this film puts on display the case was a cat and mouse game for all involved.As it was clear the greed and money and power of the old man was more important to him than trying to free his grandson, however the mother and daughter in law Gail Harris(Michelle Williams in a good performance)is deeply concerned as she puts love over money in her search to find her son. Overall this picture is a drama a struggle of will power and determination and how it overtakes greed proving love wins over money.",All the Money in the World

22,Hellmant,e do definitely learn to hate J. Paul Getty.,8,5 January 2018,"'ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD': Four Stars (Out of Five)A historical crime thriller about the abduction of J. Paul Getty's grandson, in the 1970s, and his refusal to cooperate with the kidnappers. The film is based on the 1995 book 'Painfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J. Paul Getty', by John Pearson. It was directed by Ridley Scott, and it was scripted by David Scarpa. The movie stars Michelle Williams, Christopher Plummer and Mark Wahlberg. Kevin Spacey was originally cast as J. Paul Getty, and he had already finished filming his part, but he was replaced by Plummer (due to numerous sexual misconduct allegations against him) just weeks before the movie's release. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's been nominated for three Golden Globe Awards (including Best Actress - Drama, Plummer for Best Supporting Actor, and Best Director). I mostly enjoyed it as well. John Paul Getty III (Charlie Plummer) is kidnapped by the organized crime group 'Ndrangheta, in the 1970s. He's held for ransom demands, from his grandfather, oil tycoon J. Paul Getty (Plummer), but the elder Getty refuses to cooperate. John's loving mother, Gail (Williams), desperately tries to convince the corrupt tycoon to pay the kidnappers' demands. A former CIA operative, and Getty's business manager, Fletcher Chase (Wahlberg), also aids the family in rescuing the young Getty. The movie is nicely directed (of course) by Scott, it looks great and the setting is always believable. The performance are more than decent as well (especially Williams and Plummer), and the story is somewhat interesting. The film is just a little too long and slow-paced though, and the characters aren't very relatable. We do definitely learn to hate J. Paul Getty though, and he definitely becomes more of the movie's main villain than the kidnappers even. Which I respect the film for accomplishing.",All the Money in the World

24,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Scott's lengthy, lingering biopic of the Getty saga",7,10 December 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThe true life story of John Paul Getty III (Charlie Plummer), the grandson of the billionaire oil magnate John Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer), who was abducted in Rome in 1973, with the kidnappers demanding a lot of money for his return. Getty refused to pay the ransom, reasoning that if he paid once, other abductions would lead to him doing so again, but as events rolled on, it became clear he cared more for his money than his grandson's welfare. However, Fletcher Chace (Mark Wahlberg), the 'fixer' dispatched by Getty to oversee things, formed a bond with Michelle (Gail Harris), the boy's distraught mother, that turned things around.A media furore can ensure some effective publicity for a new film, even one with an established director like Ridley Scott. In the summer of 2017, Kevin Spacey, the actor originally cast by Scott to play Getty, was involved in a scandal involving sexual abuse of younger actors, and even though his scenes had already been filmed, his name became toxic and to ensure nobody was put off from the film, they were cut, and replaced by Plummer. This is a bit of a blessing, as he suits the role better anyway, although as far as I'm aware, it didn't work in this regard, and the film slipped under the radar (it was a Netflix premiere, as far as I was aware!)In an age where original ideas are drying up like crop fields in Africa, ATMITW is another example of the vast pool of real life stories, which more often than not prove to be far more fascinating and unbelievable than any Hollywood hack could dream up. It is ripe with potential for a film adaptation, and Scott has delivered an interesting but imperfect film, adapted from John Pearson's novel Painfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortune and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J. Paul Getty.Never known for making short films, Scott this time feels to have been a little over indulgent, with a two and a quarter hour production that should have been a little more condensed. As it is, it sprawls out in many different directions, shifting focus from one character to the next, and losing cohesion as a result.Performances wise, eighty eight year old Plummer perfectly fits the skin of Getty, portrayed here as a truly despicable man, the richest man in the world, but the poorest man in terms of morals and basic human decency. How true this is to the truth I don't know, but he certainly paints a bad picture of the rich. In the main supporting roles, Wahlberg has presence, but doesn't really possess the dramatic range to really carry his role. But Williams certainly provides some highly charged drama as the distraught mother of the boy, himself well played by Plummer (gotta be Christopher's grandson!), especially during a very unsettling scene where his kidnappers decide they need to send a piece of him.You certainly won't regret seeing it, it just would have worked better had it been a bit more focused and shorter, and concentrated on one story arc instead of constantly shifting about the place. ***",All the Money in the World
25,paul2001sw-1,When too much is not enough,8,11 October 2020,"You wait for a drama about the kidnapping of Paul Getty, grandson of the famous oil tycoon John Paul, and then two come along in quick succession as if they were buses; Ridley Scott's film 'All the Money in the World' was quicly followed by the Simon Beaufoy-penned TV series, 'Trust'. Both efforts pick up on some of the same incidental details: each give a leading role to Getty Sr.'s chief neogitator, a business associate from the oil world; each reference Getty's monomanicial dream to construct a replica Roman villa in Malibu. I enjoyed 'Trust' but it felt a bit strung-out over 10 episodes; Scott's effort is more efficient, and with a sharper script as well, although there's a little unnecessary fictional melodrama at the end of the tale. What makes the story interesting, of course, is the Getty dynasty's tremendous dysfunction, a product of the madness of its founder. The conclusion, I guess, is that no-one should ever be this wealthy; not even the rich themselves ultimately benefit from it, nor can any amount of money buy you immunity from the world.",All the Money in the World
26,MOscarbradley,A tour-de-force from Plummer,6,2 April 2018,"I have no idea how good, bad or indifferent Kevin Spacey might have been as John Paul Getty in Ridley Scott's ""All the Money in the World"" as we all know he was written out of the picture and famously replaced by Christopher Plummer, not so much at the last minute but after the last minute had passed. Spacey's involvement in the production, or rather his lack of involvement, has ensured ""All the Money in the World"" a degree of notoriety it might otherwise not have had regardless of the fact that it's actually not a bad film; not a very good one but not as bad as it might have been.It's about the real-life kidnapping of Getty's grandson though you could never really describe it as a thriller. This is another movie about the filthy rich and the pleasure palaces in which they live and it's quite smartly done even if you have to take a good deal of it with a pinch of salt. If, however, you thought that Plummer's Oscar nomination was nothing more than a slap in the face for Spacey, think again; he's terrific, a near career best performance of a man most people viewed as some kind of monster but which Plummer imbues with several shades of grey. As the kidnapped boy's mother Michelle Williams is excellent while young Charlie Plummer is very good as the victim. But in the end this is Plummer's show, a tour-de-force that I doubt Spacey could have bettered. I just wish we could have seen more of him.",All the Money in the World

29,bowmanblue,Worth the watch,7,12 January 2018,"If you can get past the controversy of recasting Kevin Spacey with Christopher Plummer and having all relevant scenes reshot in about a week, you'll actually find there's quite an interesting film here. It's based on a true story about the (at the time this film was set) richest man in the world, oil billionaire Paul Getty, and his reaction to the kidnapping of his grandchild back in 1973. Now, most of us would instantly say 'Just pay the ransom!' if a family member was in mortal danger (and you had millions in your back account!). However, he responded by saying something like, 'I have fourteen grandchildren. If I pay the ransom for one I'll have thirteen more kidnapped grandchildren.' Weirdly, and against all natural parental reactions, I can kind of see where he's coming from.'All the Money in the World' is directed by veteran, Ridley Scott, so, if you've ever seen any of his other work, you'll know you're in for a visual treat. Now, on to the casting... Despite a strong cast, all talk about who was in it surrounds Kevin Spacey, who was recast after all his scenes were shot and edited into the movie, due to his off-screen life at the time. Therefore, Christopher Plummer stepped in at the last minute and went on to win awards. Before I saw the film I did wonder whether these awards were given simply to try and justify the blatant recasting, however, now I've watched it, I can see that he did turn in an amazing performance at what must have been extremely short notice. But, while we're on the subject of the stars, I think Mark Walberg deserves a mention for his part as Getty's 'facilitator.'I guess if the film does have a 'drawback' is that some may feel that it goes on for quite a long time. It feels like it's drawing to a conclusion at just over the halfway mark, before you realise that it's all starting off again. This is certainly not a thrill-ride, so you'll need to know that you're not going to get Bruce Willis storming into an enemy lair to rescue the teenage Getty. Instead, you get the story as it plays out - and all the laborious and depressing loopholes that have to be jumped through in order to get your loved one returned to you safely.So, if you're in the mood for something well-acted, well-directed, interesting, yet kind of long and drawn out, then you should definitely give this one a watch.",All the Money in the World
30,ThomasDrufke,Greed,7,30 December 2017,"It's nearly impossible to separate what happened off screen with the final product of All the Money in the World. With that said, Ridley Scott pretty much couldn't have done a better job at making a seamless transition from Kevin Spacey to Christopher Plummer in the role of J. Paul Getty. Inevitably that will be the one thing people always remember about this film, but in the end, the film succeeds elsewhere as a thriller based around the kidnapping of Getty's grandson in Rome in 1973.Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the film is its non-stop pacing. Whether or not all of the bells and whistles of this story were true, Scott is determined to keep you on the edge of your seat with suspense, even if you ultimately know where the story ends up. And luckily, this story is perfect for a cinematic experience. The true events are unfortunately tragic for many involved, but in the end it's the character of J. Paul Getty that makes for a truly riveting character to watch. Not willing to budge to pay a single dime for his grandson's ransom is beyond frugal, and the fact that the events didn't play out in an even worse manor is a miracle.Getty's pushback (or lack thereof) makes for a great back and forth with his daughter in law, Gail Harris (played by Michelle Williams). Williams is brilliant in everything, and she once again kills it as the desperate but under control mother of a kidnapped son. She will likely be overshadowed by Plummer come award shows, but Williams' talent will never go unnoticed from me.Ultimately, All the Money in the World is a fascinating tale of greed, frugality, power, and the differences in people's approach in high stress situations. From great performances to an impressive and important feat from Scott's last minute direction, I quite appreciated All the Money in the World.7.9/10",All the Money in the World
31,MLDinTN,true definition of tightwad,6,22 September 2018,"If this movie is accurate, it portrays JP Getty as a real tightwad and uncarring jerk. He is the richest man in the world at the time and his favorite grandson is kidnapped, but he refuses to pay the ransom, which is like pocket change to him. His head of security negotiates with the kidnappers and gets the ransom down to 4 million, but Getty will only give them 1 million because that is all that is tax deductible. Just crazy if it is true. I wonder when the grandson escapes by creating a fire, if that part was true and if the police man that finds him really took bribe money from the kidnappers to turn the kid back over. Was true or just drama made up for the film. I knew that kid was going to be sorry for hopping in the first car to come along. And I didn't get the ending. The kidnappers release the kid, but see the police are out searching for him and instead of trying to get out of town, want to chase the kid down, knowing the cops are looking for the kid. It was like they wanted to get caught. The movie could have been a little shorter, but overall had a good enough story to keep my attention.FINAL VERDICT: Interesting story about a scrougey, old billionaire.

32,lesleyharris30,"Slow and Monotonous, had more Potential,",6,18 February 2018,"All the Money in the World is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a talented cast. The highlight of the film is, without any doubt, Christopher Plummer as J. Paul Getty, he has a terrifically dark and sinister presence in the role, without even making a huge attempt to be startling, instead letting off an uncomfortably charming vibe. When you put in to consideration the limited space of time they had to film his significant role, it is even more impressive. Ridley Scott redid all of Getty's scenes, replacing Kevin Spacey with Plummer, in nine days, and he fits in to the film seamlessly. It is a very fascinating true story that could have made for a very immerseful thriller, and I think this is what they were trying to do, but they just took far too nuch time with it. There are so many scenes with bland dialogue that barely extends the plot, instead leaving us longing for more, there are very few moments that had me at the edge of my seat. The film is also about 30 minutes longer than it needs to be, I got to a point where I really stopped caring about Paul Getty and whether they would find him or not, I just wanted to go home. It never gave me a reason to want any of these characters to win, none of them, bar Gail, were very likeable. An aggressive drag. While Plummer, Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg bring in great performances, All the Money in the World was simply not half as good as it could have been.

33,secondtake,Startling story but a sometimes slow and routine telling of it,7,25 July 2018,"All the Money in the World (2017)What an extreme pathology, yet with a twist. J. Paul Getty was known to me mostly as the man who left a fortune when he died that became the Getty Art Museum. Which was famous (and still is) for having deep pockets. Very deep. So Getty, from 20th Century oil enterprises, was really rich.Hence the name of the movie. But they should have clued us in, I suppose (for better sales) that it's about Getty's grandson, who early in the movie (no spoiler) gets kidnapped. What follows is a two part story--the kidnappers and their prey, and the grandfather and other family members.And it's the grandfather who matters most, played with conviction by a rather too-old Christopher Plummer (as a famous last minute substitute for someone who we won't mention). Plummer is ruthless and seemingly heartless. His daughter-in-law is the one sympathetic character here (besides the grandson, I suppose, but he isn't developed very far), and she suffers and struggles. It's her son out there in the hands of some thugs.The movie is good, very good in some ways, but routinely made. The story is great, so that holds it up, yet the pacing is slow, which brings it back to earth. The kidnappers are made to seem interesting and one of them (played by the great French actor Romain Duris) is given some depth, but really this is the other half of a fascinating situation, and some nuance would have been great.
Surprisingly, this is not only produced by also directed by Ridley Scott. And this lacks the originality and spark we'd expect from him. But Plummer is terrific and so is Michelle Williams as the daughter/mother. Mark Wahlberg is a drip and a mistake (he plays a kind of do-it-all man for Getty, and he's very average).Still, lots of interesting twists, and a worthy story for a film.",All the Money in the World

36,tomgillespie2002,The dark side of money,7,19 April 2018,"It wouldn't be fair to Ridley Scott's latest film to dwell too much on the revolting allegations that came out regarding Kevin Spacey and his sexually aggressive behaviour, yet the 80 year-old's reaction to the news and subsequent quick-thinking led to one of the most impressive aspects of All the Money in the World. Filming had already wrapped with Spacey in the lead donning heavy prosthetic makeup, but Scott quite rightly opted to remove the disgraced actor from the final product entirely, save for one scene in which his face is digitally replaced. Scenes were re-shot in an astonishing nine days, with Scott's initial first choice Christopher Plummer now playing the role of tycoon J. Paul Getty.The result is not a film that appears to be quickly patched together, but one that seamlessly pieces together the old footage with the new. As Getty, you will believe that Plummer was present for the duration. He effortlessly balances Getty's occasional playfulness with his more tyrannical and stubborn sides, and he cuts an impenetrable yet enigmatic figure. Questions surrounding his refusal to pay his grandson's ransom when the 16 year-old is kidnapped in Rome forms the film's biggest mystery. Is he concerned that coughing up the dough will only inspire the kidnapping of more vulnerable heirs to vast fortunes? Does he believe that John Paul Getty III (played by Charlie Plummer, no relation) arranged the whole thing himself to get a slice of the action? Or is he simply a stingy old man, seeing no reason to spend a dime on something he sees as a bad business deal?At the time, oil-rich Getty was not only the richest man on the planet, but the richest man there had ever been. It would seem that he never invested without the promise of a return. The old coot spends much of his time in dark, grandiose rooms within his spectacular mansion, pouring over the latest figures as if every cent must be accounted for. When he is informed that his favourite yet wayward grandchild has disappeared, his eyes never leave the books. We are informed via flashback that Getty III's parents, Gail Harris (Michelle Williams) and John Paul Getty Jr. (Andrew Buchan), divorced years earlier due to the latter's drug abuse, with the mother receiving full custody. This, in J. Paul's eyes, was a betrayal, and possibly the first time he has lost something he couldn't simply throw money at. There's also the possibility that malice may be driving the stinking-rich old man's complete disinterest in paying what is a small sum in the context of his vast fortune. It takes the arrival of a severed ear make him re-consider.Like many of Scott's recent efforts, All the Money in the World has its flaws, albeit far fewer than the likes of Robin Hood or Alien: Covenant. If there is a blemish on what is a stellar cast, its Mark Wahlberg as Getty's former CIA operative adviser Fletcher Chace. While everybody else disappears into their role, he can only muster his Boston everyman act and sticks out like a sore thumb. For a film that initially takes its time developing the characters and their backgrounds, it can't help but introduce tired tropes which didn't occur in real life, such as the sympathetic kidnapper Cinquanta (Romain Duris) and a climax involving a desperate chase through the streets. Still, Scott manages to keep us engrossed in the story, ramping up the tension with a frantic pace whether you know how it played out in real life or not. This is the director back to his The Martian best, and how he cannot seem to replicate this quality when he diverts into the Alien franchise is a head-scratcher. And Christopher Plummer is truly exceptional.",All the Money in the World

The pros about the film? The performances were great. Michelle Williams playing JPG III mother and will do whatever it takes to get her son back. Her performance of trying to convince her grandfather in law to help pay the ransom. Christopher Plummer delivered a great performance. Mark Wahlberg was good as well playing an advisor and an operative to the Getty family. Director Ridley Scott can deliver some powerful performances in a dramatic film. Look at American Gangster or The Martian. Sure, this is not like sci fi films like Aliens or Prometheus. It is slow moving and all about a family and the theme of greed. Especially on a powerful guy who is greedy and only has desire on wanting more money. The cons of the film? I felt like the music score was weak with the film. The music score being done by Daniel Pemberton. The setting takes place in the 1970s and could have used the advantage with a 70s soundtrack or a fitting score. But it just did not fit in with the film. The film can be slow at times from a script by David Scarpa. But the film is left undeveloped with the characters played by Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg. Making it very forgettable.Overall, it is a pretty fair film.

The film has a strong message regarding the appreciation of money and as it shows, it can't always buy what is needed. Apparently inspired by true events.As a film, this movie is quite slow at the beginning though it does get better but overall the film is a drama without much drama, suspense or thrills. It is all very much predictable and a lot of the film drags on. Also the characters are really quite unlikable to a point where we start to not care about whether the kid Paul even gets released.Furthermore a lot of praise is given to Christopher Plummer due to the controversy surrounding the events taken away from Kevin Spacey, though as an opinion, one thought Spacey would have performed this role much better and more engaging than Plummer.

39,eddie_baggins,A passionless thriller,4,1 May 2018,"Likely to be forever known as the film that erased Kevin Spacey from its existence, All the Money in the World is in many ways a fair feat of filmmaking in its ability to rearrange its pieces at the last minute and replace one of its key actors with late ring-in Christopher Plummer but Ridley Scott's passionless affair is, outside of this component, a dull and rather bland telling of an incredible true life story.An event that griped the world back in the early 70's, when oil tycoon and renowned billionaire John Paul Getty refused to pay the ransom fee for his kidnapped grandson John Paul Getty III, the story of the Getty's and this particular time in their life should make for edge of your seat viewing but as has been the case with a large portion of Scott's more recent films (barring the fun The Martian), Money just never truly threatens to become a genuinely thrilling experience and squanders its chance to be the quintessential portrayal of this world capturing event.Scott fails to connect us to these characters in any significant way, this is particularly harmful when we feel no connection to the kidnapped John Paul (portrayed here by Charlie Plummer) while the always good Michelle Williams and the more sleepwalking like Mark Wahlberg fail to make much of mark as John Paul's grieving mother Gail Harris or Getty's ex-CIA right hand man Fletcher Chase respectively and with this, the chances of Money becoming a truly engaging experience are squashed down by a procession of scenes and scenarios that become rather uninteresting when they should be gripping us tightly and not letting go.It's a real shame as you get the sense that Scott in his heyday would've made this a more heartfelt and pulse-pounding feature, although screenwriter David Scarpa's script leaves a lot to desired and the effect of having to re-do much of the films key scenes with the solid and Oscar-nominated Plummer may've likely had a much larger domino effect on a film, that feels like it lacked a clear direction, a standout lead and the unfortunate inability to make us care for a bunch of people going through a very public and horrific scenario.Final Say - The true life story at the heart of Scott's film is a highly interesting and potentially thrilling one to be told but All the Money in the World is a cold and pedestrian affair enlivened only by its high quality production shimmer and shine. For a more engaging Getty ride its likely Danny Boyle's mini-series Trust will be the way to go.2 farmhouse surgeries out of 5",All the Money in the World

Don't get me wrong, it's full of intensity from the beginning to the end, and there are some good performances from Plummer and Williams but like many movies that were released this year, it just seemed too long and the plot went round and round in circles. I didn't know anything about the John Paul Getty III kidnapping, so I was quite surprised that the plot was true but from an entertainment point of view, I expected more from Ridley Scott, who has been letting me down of late. Anyway, the movie is set in 1973, and it begins with a 16-year-old John Paul Getty III (Charlie Plummer) wandering around the streets of Rome, without a care in the world. After chatting to a couple of prostitutes on the street, John is kidnapped by an organised crime ring, who demand a $17million ransom from his Billionaire grandfather, Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer), who was at that time the world's richest private citizen. The movie then flashes back to 1971, when Paul's parents, Gail Harris (Michelle Williams) and John Paul Getty Jr. (Andrew Buchan), were divorced, due to John's drug addiction and womanising. Gail rejected any alimony in exchange for full custody of her children in the divorce settlement, so she hasn't got any way to pay the ransom. She turns to Paul Getty for help with paying the kidnappers but he refuses to pay them, stating that it would encourage further kidnappings on his family. With the media paying much attention to the kidnapping, Paul turns to his Getty Oil negotiator, and former CIA agent operative, Fletcher Chace (Mark Wahlberg), to investigate the case and secure Paul's release. Meanwhile, Getty III is held hostage in a remote location in Italy, and one of the kidnappers, Cinquanta (Romain Duris), take a shine to him because of his quiet and submissive demeanour. After waiting ages for the ransom to be paid, they decide to move Getty III to another location. Meanwhile, Fletcher manages to track down the kidnapper's whereabouts but they have already moved to there new location, where they have sold Paul Getty III to a more ruthless set of kidnappers. With Cinquanta negotiating with Gail over the phone, they drop the ransom but she still can't come up with the money. The kidnappers then send the newspapers Getty III left ear, to show that they mean business, and after some harsh words between Fletcher and Paul Getty, the Oil Tycoon finally agrees to pay the ransom. Basically, the whole situation could have been dealt with much sooner, if Paul Getty wasn't so tight with his money but I can understand the principle in why he didn't want to pay them after the first demand. His unemotional demeanour, even though he kept on saying that Getty III was his favourite grandchild, really did surprise me throughout the film but it was obvious that he had to crack at the end. The director could have shown how horrendous the situation was from Getty III point of view, which would have made the long kidnapping seem more intense. Anyway, Michelle Williams and Christopher Plummer put in a top performance, and it was good to see Wahlberg not showing off his muscles, or blowing anything up for a change. I also liked Romain Duris, who played Cinquanta because he brought some authenticity to the movie, and he seemed to be the only person who really cared about Getty III, except for his mother of course. Although Getty had all of the money in the world, he really was a lonely person, who died of heart-related problems before he got to see his grandson. Surpringsly, he left Gail to manage her children's inherited wealth until they are of age, and she is told that his company was set up as a charitable trust, which meant that Getty's income was tax-free but not spendable. After such an emotional ordeal, we don't get to see how it takes it's toll on the family because the director chose to spend most of the time concentrating on the kidnapping. Personally, I was more interested in Paul Getty than the kidnapping because his story was quite amazing. Anyway, it's another one of those movies that's worth a one-watch but once you know the outcome, you won't be wanting to watch it again. Average!Round-Up:
With Kevin Spacy having to pull out at the last minute because of the sexual misconduct allegations, Ridley Scott only had a month to reshoot all of his scenes, with the newly cast Christopher Plummer as J. Paul Getty. What A Task! Everyone thought that it would have been easier to ditch the project, especially as the advertising campaign was due to start within a month but Ridley Scott used the scenes that he already had shot, and added some new shots with Plummer to make the deadline. Personally, I couldn't imagine anyone else playing J. Paul Getty! Anyway, everyone is familiar with Ridley Scott's previous work, which includes the fantastic Alien franchise, although the new ones are a bit lame, the Blade Runner franchise, Legend, Black Rain, Thelma & Louise, White Squall, G.I. Jane, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Hannibal, Kingdom Of Heaven, American Gangster, Body Of Lies, Robin Hood, The Counsellor, Exodus and the Martian. He's kind of lost his touch of late, especially with the latest Alien movies but at 80 years old, and 8 projects in the pipeline, he's not showing any signs of slowing down. He's known for getting what he wants when it comes to directing but I personally find him moody and miserable. With that aside, he has made some of the biggest movies of all time, and he has been nominated for 4 Oscars for the Martian, Black Hawk Down, Gladiator and Thelma & Louise but he's always been beaten at the post. I'm sure he will get a lifetime achievement award, at some point but he has a long way to go to meet the standards that he was hitting with his previous blockbusters. Average!Budget: $50million

41,howard.schumann,"""What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world but lose his own soul?""",9,5 January 2018,"In 1973, if any 16-year-old boy were to be kidnapped on the streets of Rome, it might warrant a brief mention in the papers. If the boys' last name was Getty, however, it would be a major story followed closely throughout the world. Written by David Scarpa and based on John Pearson's book ""Painfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J Paul Getty,"" 80-year-old director Ridley Scott's (""Alien: Covenant"") All the Money in the World tackles such an explosive story, the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III (Charlie Plummer, ""The Dinner""), grandson of oil tycoon John Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer, ""The Man Who Invented Christmas""), and a billionaire said to be the richest man in the world.At the last minute, sexual assault charges led Scott to replace Kevin Spacey with Christopher Plummer in the role of Getty and reshoot the role in ten days to qualify for a December release and it is a seamless transition. Nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor, Plummer's convincing performance makes us wonder, however, why he was not originally chosen for the role. Though the film is not an in-depth characterization of John Paul Getty and is not designed to be, it succeeds as an edge-of-the-seat thriller that will keep you engaged throughout. Snatched off the streets of Rome by the Calabria-based mafia led by the tough, but ultimately sympathetic, Cinquanta (Romain Duris, ""In the Shadow of Iris""), the long-haired Getty is taken to a remote location in Southern Italy.A flashback to the 1960s provides a thin back-story showing how the oil magnate's son John Paul Getty II (Andrew Buchan, ""The Deaths of Ian Stone"") was invited to Rome and offered the position of Vice-President in his company. For Getty II, it was a welcome gesture after years of neglect, but the fact that he had to sink or swim in an industry he knew next to nothing about eventually caused a breakdown and the dissolution of his marriage. The flashback also shows the developing bond between Getty and his grandson who he gives an Egyptian sculpture allegedly worth 1.2 million dollars, but later shown to be worth no more that a thrift store trinket.The young Getty learns, however, that his grandfather is the reincarnation of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, considered by some to be a ""humanist"" despite his being responsible for the deaths of 580,000 Jews during the Bar Kokhba revolt. Days after the abduction, the boy's mother Gail Harris Getty (impeccably performed by Michelle Williams, ""Wonderstruck""), receives a ransom demand for 17 million dollars, a tidy sum for most people, but chump change for Getty who was worth close to an estimated two billion dollars. Letting the kidnappers know that she does not have that kind of money or anywhere close to it, she visits her former father-in-law, the one person she knows who does.Doing his best Ebenezer Scrooge imitation, the self-absorbed billionaire refuses to pay the ransom, believing that the younger Getty may have faked his kidnapping to extort money from him. Getty also says that if he were to give in to the ransom demands, his 14 other grandchildren would become prime targets, a not unreasonable assumption but cruel under the circumstances, especially given his spending millions of dollars on a new painting. Ostensibly feeling like he should do something, Getty appoints business associate and former CIA operative Fletcher Chase (Mark Wahlberg, ""Patriots Day"") to help Gail secure his grandson's release with the real or imagined assistance of the Italian police.Like a desirable piece of property at a slave auction, Paul is sold to Mammoliti (Marco Leonardi, ""The Space Between""), a mafia kingpin higher up in the chain. Four months later, a box is delivered to Getty containing a lock of his grandson's hair and most of his ear, brutally detached in an unwatchable scene. As the haggling continues, Scott's no-nonsense approach builds the tension that pits a mother's determination against the will of the privileged and corrupt. While in some quarters Getty will be remembered as an art collector who established the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, Plummer's portrayal of a man without qualities reminds one of the biblical admonition, ""What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world but lose his own soul?"" (Mark 8:36). The phrase, however, presupposes that the man in question is even aware that he has a soul to lose.",All the Money in the World
42,Tweetienator,What Happend to Ridley!?,5,31 March 2018,"I am a little clueless regarding the works of Ridley Scott. He made imo some of the best movies of modern movie making (The Duelists, Alien, Legend, Blade Runner, Black Hawk Down to name some of my most favorite) but the last outputs of his work are mostly mediocre and - redundant.The stories of his latest movies like Alien: Covenant, The Martian, Exodus - and now All the Money in the World - are the weak point. The production and acting always is pro and mostly well crafted but somehow all of the maestro's latest movies tell us zillion times told stories.All the Money in the World is no movie about the mafia nor about the super-rich, not a thriller, not really dramatic, not really about crime, its about everything and nothing and everything looks like I watched it already and was done before (and better) and all the scenes to the respective ""scenarios"" (Mafia, Billionaires Club, Police etc.) are almost ""drawn"" like caricatures, bones without flesh and blood.All the Money in the World is not a bad movie but it is also not a good one. One I would stream or buy on DVD (on sale) to complete my Ridley collection (if I would got one) but not a movie I would choose for a night out on cinema if I would know the quality of the movie before. TV stuff, not real cinema stuff.The last really good movies of Mr. Scott are imo Kingdom of Heaven from 2005 and Robin Hood from 2010, the new outputs are somehow about the level of one of his most weak movies of the past: G.I. Jane - which is also filled with stereotypical characters and a story on full cliche mode.Mr. Scott should take a leave for sometime, find his strength (and maybe his love and spirit for movie-making again) and than return with strong material, and make fantastic movies again, as he is imo still able to do. All in all: disappointing.",All the Money in the World
43,matthewssilverhammer,...Can Not a Good Movie Buy,4,26 January 2018,"It's rarely a good sign when the story behind a film's production is more interesting than the film itself. It shouldn't take over 2 hours to basically just shove the cliché ""money is the root of all evil"" down our bored throat. Good on Scott for recasting that monster (and with a Nazi hater at that!), but this thing is in desperate need of some color and character.",All the Money in the World
44,southdavid,Lacking a spark of greatness.,5,10 January 2018,"When the controversy boils away, all that's left is the final product. With Kevin Spacey's noisy removal from ""All the Money in the World"", long after principle photography was completed and the subsequent expensive reshoots, the film earned itself hundreds of column inches before anyone had even seen it. So is the loose biopic actually any good? For my money . . . not really. From the outset, it's explained to you that wealth at the level that the Getty's operate is dehumanising. Children are at first a distraction from accumulation then later, and even graver, an inferior investment, squandering their inheritance on poor choices. This knowledge facilitates the decision at the heart of the story, which would be incompressible to all of us that would pay the earth to save our children from an ounce of suffering. If you could easily afford the ransom, why would you not pay for the safe return of one of your grandchildren? Perhaps surprising, given the last minute recasting is how much Getty appears in the film. Christopher Plummer features heavily in the runtime and has major scenes with almost all the cast. Only in some early scenes in the Middle East, is it possible to detect even the slightest hint of green screen trickery. Plummer plays Getty like an anthropomorphised Crocodile, capable of a smile and outward show of affection, but the ruthlessness behind the eyes never leaving. It's interesting that the suggestion is that he's playing the performance with more warmth than Spacey did, who must have been truly monstrous. The heart of the film though lies in two performances; Michelle Williams as Getty Jnr's mother Gail and Romain Duris as initial kidnapper Cinquanta. Williams, excellent as always, though hampered with a mannered accent, shows plenty of emotion, begging for time and money from both the abductors and her former father-in-law. The choice to show steely determination, rather than reduce her to a blubbering wreck is a wise one especially when the adversities heighten in the second half of the film. Cinquanta is part of the opportunistic hostage taking gang, who forms a bond with his victim, which only deepens as time passes and the boy is sold from his amateur captors, into the clutches of organised crime. 
So why isn't the film an unmitigated success? To start, it's too pedestrian. The story is too slow and, as it's based on a true story, is lacking in some of the twists and turns you might anticipate. In fact, familiarity is problem throughout, with all of the tropes of kidnapping stories cropping up and all of the stereotypes of Italian Gangsters brought to bear. Baring a nice homage in the opening scenes, the direction is pretty pedestrian - though the recreation of the time period is nicely done. All in all, the film is just lacking a spark in any quarters to drag it from realms of ""acceptable"" towards ""excellent""",All the Money in the World
45,videorama-759-859391,It's a rich old codger's world,8,10 January 2018,"The first thing here, was how great, would it have been to see Kevin Spacey play the embittered old miser, who with his insanely vulgar display of wealth, refuses to pay for his grandson (this talented actor incidentally sharing the same surname as our replacement Plummer) who has been kidnapped by petty terrorists. Well sadly, that remains to not be seen. There are reasons, Plummer, won't bargain, with all the imploring from his grandsons mother (Williams, who's just riveting, and so bloody believable in all her screen time) to grandson Getty back. They are shown earlier on in a section of movie, before we return to the here and now, where that explains some of Plummer's malicious incentive, but when it comes down to it, he's just a selfish, bitter old miser you keep hating throughout. His bodyguard, ex CIA, frogman, what have you (Wahlberg) teams up with Williams, to try to locate and snatch him from his abducters, but of course, we know how things like this follow, where serpentine actions/descisions come into play, resulting in some seriously mid range intense moments. Wahlberg does do us, solid, but there are some moments where he doesn't come off as believable, like a lost sheep, to William's dialogue (spouting words, not acting upon him) while an older Timothy Hutton appears in a score of scenes as one of Plummer's slightly shady, cocky, financial advisers, Plummer, a great actor, doesn't disappoint in the role, doing his normal A1 work, and a Grade A trooper for stepping in at the last minute, due to Spacey's notoriety But it's Williams who walks away, seriously with acting honors. This true story. based on this miserable old millionaire, John Paul Getty, who'd rather pay insanely for a crappy Mona Lisa portrait, then his grandson's freedom, has been wonderfully and vividly brought to the screen, with great detail to story and structure of story, and is a wonderful, fresh way, to start off movie viewing day, 2017. You'll so much hate Plummer, just hoping in his final minutes, he will croak. Like
Williams, it's obvious what the audience will feel like doing, to his own black sculptured head statue.",All the Money in the World
46,paul-allaer,"""We look like you, but we're nothing like you""",8,26 December 2017,"""All The Money In the World"" (2017 release; 132 min.) is ""inspired by true events"", we are reminded at the beginning. As the movie opens, we are told it is ""Rome, 1973"", where we see the 16 yr. old Paul Getty (whose grandfather J. Paul Getty is the richest man in the world's history) is wandering the streets of Rome late one night, only to be abducted. Soon thereafter the abductors demand a ransom of $17 million (about $99 million in today's money). When Paul's mom approaches the elder Getty, he refuses to pay. The voice over by Paul reminds us: ""We look just like you but are nothing like you..."" The movie then gives us the nutshell version of how J Paul Getty made his fortune, taking us to ""Saudi Arabia 1948"" and the ""Toulon, France Shipyard, 1958"". At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Ridley Scott, now a crisp 80 years young if you can believe it. Here he recounts the events surrounding the kidnapping of J. Paul Getty's grandson.. I hope for your enjoyment's sake that, as was the case for me, you don't know how this ends up, I don't want to say much more than that, other than to hold on to your chairs... You have have heard that, resulting from the sexual assault allegations, the movie makers decided to reshoot his scenes... after the movie had been completed and with less than 5 weeks to go before its release. Scott apparently relished the challenge, and Christopher Plummer was recast at J Paul Getty. Not only did the film makers pull it off, but I have to say that Plummer is so outstanding in this role, that I cannot imagine Spacey for this role. Plummer casts a long shadow (in the best possible way) over this movie, almost at the expense of Michelle Williams (as Paul's mother). Mark Wahlberg plays Chase, a former CIA operative and designated by Getty as the negotiator to try and get Paul released. Bottom line: this is a great real life crime drama that also looks at the isolating effect of being so rich that you never know whether anyone around you is sincere or simply in it for the money.""All The Money In the World"" opened wide today. While I wanted to see it, it was actually my grown-up kids who choose this for our annual Christmas Day movie. The early evening screening where we saw this at here in Cincinnati was completely sold out down to the last seat, Given the positive buzz and word-of-mouth this movie will likely create, this movie may have surprisingly long legs at the box office, even more so if high profile award nominations continue to come in (it already did quite well with 4 Golden Globe nominations). In any event, I encourage you to check out ""All the Money in the World"", be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions.",All the Money in the World
47,jamesrupert2014,Overrated,5,24 January 2020,"The grandson of the world's richest man is kidnapped in Italy and held for ransom. Unfortunately, granddad seems to be a bit of a miser. Based on the true story of the 1973 Getty kidnapping, 'All the Money in the World' is a somewhat 'by the numbers' thriller with some extraneous fictional embellishments, presumably because the writers thought that the true story wasn't interesting enough. Christopher Plummer plays J. P. Getty as a stereotypical heartless, self-obsessed über-capitalist who is reluctant to pay even a tiny fraction of his vast fortune to rescue his wayward grandson and namesake, J.P. Getty III (Charlie Plummer, no relation to Christopher). Michelle Williams is quite good as J.P.G. III's desperate mother Gail Harris, Mark Wahlberg is uninspired as ex-CIA agent and Getty 'fixer' Fletcher Chace, and the rest of the cast are pretty standard low-life or gangster tropes. Despite being directed by A-lister Ridley Scott, I was unimpressed with the film, especially the insipid 'fake history' parts (the fictional escape sequence with its trite ending, the hoary 'identify the body' scene, the 'ironic' timing of the senior Getty's death (he actually died three years afterwards)). I understand the difference between a documentary and entertainment but the story of the Getty kidnapping is interesting enough without glomming on a bunch of 'made-for-TV' quality 'dramatic events'.

The bad guys, which means just about every character in this movie, are reprehensible, J. Paul Getty is depicted as a cynical miser who believes he us being conned by his own grandson. His son is depicted as a drunk and his grandson, a carbon copy of his father. Whether this is a product of literary license is another matter. The only character in this movie who is actually worth caring about is Getty II's mother, played by Michelle Williams. She carries the movie. Without a strong performance from her, this movie would fail as a work of drama, reason: all the other characters are so depraved. Except for the mother, the audience has no one to root for.

This movie is based on the true story that took place in Italy in 1973 concerning the kidnapping of J. Paul Getty's grandson, John Paul Getty the 3rd. FYI: Balthazar Getty-an actor that used to play on Brothers & Sisters_tv-is the son of John Paul Getty the 3rd, so this movie is about his father's kidnapping. Christopher plays J.Paul Getty, the richest man in the world. Kevin Spacey had the role originally but he got into a little sexual scandal and was replaced at the last minute with all of his scenes being reshot. Charlie plays the 16 year old grandson that gets kidnapped for a 17 million dollar ransom and Michelle plays Charlie's mother, daughter in law to Christopher. Although he had plenty of money, Christopher refused to pay the ransom-he said that if he paid it, then someone would just kidnap any of his other grandchildren and pretty soon, he would be broke. He was a little bit of a miser, too. Charlie was his favorite grandchild so he hired Mark, an ex C.I.A. agent, to help get his grandson back. The story is interesting if you are unfamiliar with it but it was not an action packed thrill ride. More like a movie of the week.

53,jimbo-53-186511,I found it a little underwhelming,4,13 January 2019,"Rome; 1973 and John Paul Getty III is kidnapped and the kidnappers set his ransom at $17,000 US Dollars. Getty's wealthy grandfather J Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer) refuses to pay the ransom and instead employs the services of negotiator and former CIA operative Fletcher Chase (Mark Wahlberg). In the meantime, J Paul Getty III's mother is doing everything she can to secure his release despite not having the funds to pay the kidnappers...Ridley Scott shows flashes of what we know he is capable of at the start of the film; a tense build-up followed by an abrupt kidnapping, but then the wheels seem to come off after a fairly impressive opening...After this scene the film then continues, but seems to do so with an out of sequence narrative (which presumably was set up this way to try and create some heart and empathy), but is done with so little feeling or care that it did very little to resonate any feeling with this viewer. This is supposed to be a thriller, but it lacks any genuinely exciting moments, any tension and is also badly paced and at times lethargic and boring.The film devotes a lot of time to negotiating J Paul Getty III's release and J Paul Getty's stubbornness and refusal to pay the ransom - the film does skate the line as to whether Getty does this because he doesn't really care about his family or whether he merely isn't prepared to offload that kind of money without exploring every other possible avenue. Regardless of his real intentions, the film does lean the viewer towards believing that Getty was an absolute b***ard and without researching this properly myself I'm unsure whether this was an accurate representation of Getty, but viewers can make their own judgement on this - although I will say that regardless of the accuracy of how the character was portrayed there is no denying that the picture is a tad heavy-handed and preachy.The acting performances are all OK without anyone being exceptional; Christopher Plummer does deserve some acknowledgement for bringing out the worst in Getty and does do a good job in making us hate his character (which was clearly the intention). Despite being integral to the plot, Wahlberg does not do an awful lot of interest and the same can be said for Michelle Williams. The only other performance worthy of any sort of acknowledgement was that of Charlie Plummer who at least managed to evoke vulnerability and fear (interestingly he shares a surname with Christopher Plummer, but is apparently no relation to him).Even as a standalone film, this is not very good, but as a Ridley Scott film it is really bad. He's directed so many good films and I'm really struggling to conceive how he managed to direct something so poor - then again he directed The Counsellor which was another poor film which just goes to prove that even the best directors are not always able to turn straw into gold.",All the Money in the World
54,myriamlenys,interesting but imperfect reconstruction of a famous kidnapping case,7,16 September 2018,"I'm in several minds about this one. I enjoyed watching it, but still, it has some serious problems. The main problem, I suppose, is the fact that nearly all the American characters (whether good, bad or anything in between) are well-drawn, detailed and life-like, while nearly all the European characters (whether good, bad or anything in between) tend to be caricatures or cyphers. Of course you might object that people such as Italian mobsters and kidnappers are not known for the rich depth of their inner life, in the same way that they are not known for their willingness to share life histories and résumés, but still, there's a strange division here. The American characters fairly leap from the screen, pulsing with life and credibility, whereas the European characters wear mustaches and drink red wine. For some reason or another, there was something about the ending which seemed empty or contrived. After such a long and careful build-up, the movie deserved better. Having said this, there are some good performances to enjoy, mainly by the actors who play the various individuals peopling the Getty family tree. Christopher Plummer is especially riveting as old J. Paul Getty, a sanctimonious monster unwilling to pay ransom money - not because he fears encouraging criminals or endangering his numerous descendants (both of which would be respectable concerns) but because he can't bear the thought of parting with even one penny out of his vast fortune. It is possible that the real-life J. Paul Getty was less of a b.st.rd - one gathers that his ex-daughter-in-law may have had an axe to grind - but as a character and a performance his fictional recreation is a sight to behold.It is not only a transfixing performance, but also an illuminating one : by watching Plummer, one learns something about the nature and power of greed, especially among those already rich. The people who cut down whole forests, complete with teeming wildlife and endangered species ; the people who refuse to grant their employees one or two toilet breaks ; the people who complain about their small change being used to build hospitals ; the people who will sue and litigate for years rather than install an extra lifeboat on the deck of their ships : this is what makes them tick. Finally the movie did a good job of evoking the loneliness and suffering of Getty's young grandson, who was held captive under conditions so dire that they were to blight the rest of his life.

61,bkrauser-81-311064,A Good Yarn with Some Uncomfortable Questions,8,10 January 2018,"All the Money in the World stars Michelle Williams as the vexed but headstrong Gail; mother of the sixteen-year-old John Paul Getty (Charlie Plummer), the eldest heir to the Getty family oil fortune. On the night of July 10, 1973, the young John Paul is picked up by a windowless van along the Plazza Farese in Rome. He is quietly kidnapped by masked men asking for a fortune in ransom from his grandfather, then the richest man in the world. Unbeknownst to the kidnappers and frightfully well known to the rest of his family, Gail included, J. Getty (Christopher Plummer) is an impossibly frugal man.I came in knowing little to nothing about the plot of the film which definitely helped the viewing experience overall. The tension created by the increasing desperation of the kidnappers combined with Getty's miserly behavior turned what could have been a dry retelling of events into a really taut suspense thriller. You never truly know if the end result is going to go by way of Patty Hearst or the Lindbergh baby but what is clear is due to Getty's ambivalence we're in for a long siege.This may prove daunting to some. The thrust of the narrative starts and stops due to the waiting game brought on by actual events. This then allows a talent like Scott to indulge in what he likes best i.e. symbolism, thematic overlapping, philosophical back-and-forths largely having to do with aesthetics, social, political and moral subtexts that are highlighted over and over etc. It's basically the same stuff that made fans of the Alien franchise bristle from Prometheus (2012) and Alien: Covenant (2017) but this being a drama, it suddenly becomes easier to swallow.Additionally the very inclusion of Mark Wahlberg as security expert Fletcher Chase (that name though), may give audiences the impression that we're in for more fodder than what ends up being on screen. The actor serves basically connective tissue - a conduit in which Getty is to impose his power and Gail her humanity. It works for the purposes of the story but there's no denying he wears out his welcome. When his arc swells into a third-act, heartfelt speech of moral indignation I personally got flashbacks to his role in Patriots Day (2016).Markie Mark aside, the acting, the direction and the period detail is largely top-notch with Michelle Williams deserving special praise as the worried mother who refuses to be a victim. Early on we see Gail and Getty's dynamic. Her tenuous connection to the family dynasty is a small, fragile piece of the movies thematic core but she wields it mightily against Getty who seems to think everything has its price. Much ado was made about and Ridley Scott's baffling decision to do extensive reshoots after wrap, after Kevin Spacey's sexual harassment allegations were brought to light. The goal was to remove the actor entirely and replace him with Plummer, the actor Scott originally wanted to play the role in question, but couldn't due to scheduling. I for one was skeptical of this decision. Even if the gifted director, actor and the production team were able to convincingly remove Spacey via cut, paste and shoot around - a task I assumed was impossible, the question would always remain in my mind, should they? Mind you not from a moral standpoint, Spacey is in all likelihood a man-handsy bridge troll; I'm talking artistically and casting wise. If you were to tell me Plummer was to be plugged into any other Spacey role I'd call you nut. Would this actually work?I'm glad to say it did and not just technically either. Plummer is fabulous to the point where it's hard to see anyone else wondering ambulant down the art filled halls of Getty's Xanadu. From the moment of his introduction to the old curmudgeon's last bow, Plummer effortlessly transports us into the mind of a vainglorious, money-hungry miser. He assumes he takes his place among emperors and captains of industry even while this story posits he belongs among murderers and thieves. We may never know what Spacey did to accent the role but based on what little knowledge I have, I'm going to trust Scott on his discussion.Of course now that it's possible to effectively remove problem actors from projects with only the size of Wahlberg's shoulder pads being a tell, more uncomfortable questions emerge. It's clear from the thoughts of industry insiders and anonymous online comments that people are still reeling from the very thought of digital removal and replacement. Yesterday it was Superman's mustache; today it's Frank Underwood, who knows what tomorrow may bring.It's a discussion for another time however. Long after the smoke has cleared and the initial controversy subsides, it's likely All the Money in the World will take its place near the top of Ridley Scott's lesser works. It's good, even great in portions but some of the film's pacing issues and on-screen indulgences cripple the film from being anything more than a good yarn.",All the Money in the World

Here, we have the kidnapped victim's mother being involved in close-proximity (and highly deadly) search situations - which we all know is simply outlandish, and unworthy of any work claiming to be a major 'based on fact' motion picture (this we expect from a 'B' grader but a big $50 million movie?) I had read nothing about the sacking of Spacey in the somewhat repugnant J.Paul Getty role, so the addition of re-shot scenes featuring Plummer offered no problem whatsoever (seems some people over react to what they read about) The excellent opening line attributed to young Getty, promises more than the overall delivers. With that said... it's still a good looking, interesting, suspenseful story, and watch, but is also another reason to question the ability of Ridley Scott as a respected mainstream director. It takes more than crowd-pleasing and control of the technical aspects of production - to qualify for the label of 'great' director.

65,Troy_Campbell,Fails to enthrall despite Plummer's powerhouse performance.,5,8 January 2018,"Ridley Scott's latest outing retells of the real life kidnapping of 16-year-old John Paul Getty III, grandson to billionaire Jean Paul Getty, a 5-month ordeal thanks to the oil tycoon's unwillingness to pay the $17m ransom he could so easily afford. Following the event from the perspective of both John Paul (Charlie Plummer) and his family-Getty senior (Christopher Plummer) and John Paul's mother Gail (Michelle Williams)-this dramatization is essentially two films rolled into one. On one hand we get a kidnapping thriller that tries to build tension and distress with will-he-won't-he-live stakes, on the other we delve deep into the psyche of a man who values money above all else despite having more of it than he could ever possibly spend. Unfortunately these two opposing approaches clash in all the wrong ways: just as it's hitting dramatic highs in Getty's arc, the movie whisks away to John Paul and his captors for an unwanted and, frankly, boring detour. In fact, everything to do with John Paul could have been cut. That perspective adds nothing to either this story or the abduction sub-genre overall, and only serves as a muddled distraction from the more absorbing tale of Getty's greed, ruthlessness and loneliness. When veteran actor Christopher Plummer is on screen he's spellbinding; his monologues dark and potent, his eyes a gateway to great depths of emotion. All this, remarkably, after replacing Kevin Spacey two months from release when the film was already in the can. Plummer deserves the awards buzz for his powerhouse performance, but ultimately All the Money in the World fails to excite or enthral anywhere near as much as it should have.",All the Money in the World

69,aciessi,Money Can't Buy Me Love,6,30 December 2017,"The true story of the Getty's, the kidnapping and how wealth and power usually overpowers love and human decency. All the Money in the World is a film for the age of ultimate greed, however, this is not a story that hasn't already been told and might I add, much better told. Ridley Scott does a fine job, however. He directs a dialogue driven film from an action director's perspective, which is much more visually pleasing. The scenes involving the kidnapping of Paul Getty are fascinating, cringe-worthy and at times quite brutal, including an ear slicing scene that is Reservoir Dog's worthy.But let's face it, we all came here for one reason. How did Christopher Plummer do in the place of Kevin Spacey? Was this a rush job at the 11th hour, or did Plummer save the day and added his own unique touch to the role of J.P. Getty? I can report that the latter is thankfully true. This is Plummer's best performance since Beginners. He plays a fabulous rich SOB. One must wonder, though, how Spacey would have fared? What we now know about him, it wouldn't be too difficult for the audience to despise him. In fact, creatively, I would've kept Spacey... considering how much of a villain he is in real life. I feel like the audience would've had much more fun fearing him and rooting against him. But Plummer does it in spades and that's what really matters.Other than the obvious, the other supporting roles are good, but not noteworthy. Michelle Williams is great here, but Mark Wahlberg is spectacularly miscast as Fletcher Chase. He plays Mark Wahlberg, period. It's exactly how you'd expect him to play this kind of character and it bogs this film down quite a bit. I kept thinking of him wandering around searching for Optimus Prime.

71,rockman182,All The Money in the World (2017),7,28 December 2017,"Ridley Scott has for the most part, been on a downward spiral in recent years. With recent films like Exodus, The Counselor, and Alien: Covenant, it was hard to see what made Scott's work so special in the first place. All The Money in the World is a film that garnered attention for the wrong reasons. In the wake of Kevin Spacey's recent sexual allegations and his axing from the film, the film made buzz for the expensive Christopher Plummer replacement reshoots. This was definitely a good idea. While not perfect, this film is Scott's best film in a while and shows that he can still pull off something good.The film is based on the crazy real life story of the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III and the negotiations between the kidnappers and his mother and extremely frugal grandfather, John Paul Getty Sr. The Getty's receive Getty III's severed ear in the mail because of delayed reactions in trying to get the hostage money together. The film shows just how unwilling Getty Sr. was in spending a dime, even at the expense of his grandsons life.I thought the backstory for the film was insane but that was the allure of the film. Replacing the disgraced Spacey with Plummer was probably for the best, because Plummer is actually fantastic in this. Getty Sr. is a rather fascinating character and just trying to see how selfish and frugal he was mind-boggling.. He had short time to work on the film yet puts on one of his best performances. Michelle Williams is also a workhorse of a performer, and its no different here. I hope neither of these two get lost in the Award season shuffle because of the negativity associated with Spacey.The film does suffer from the long running length and a middle act that drags, however I think the performances and dark nature of the film keep it going. It's not near Scott's early and best work in sci-fi but it shows that with a good script he has still got the style and ability to bring forth an engaging bio drama. Definitely worth a watch just to see the madness involved.7.5/10",All the Money in the World
72,RforFilm,All the Money in the World is an actors palette with an intriguing mystery. The clunky tone prevents it from being a favorite.,8,11 January 2018,"What's the right balance between success at work and success with your family? That's hard to say. The best way took look at it is what person your examining. For most, they work for their family. Everyone has the right to do whatever it takes to protect their family, and that includes making sure they have a place to sleep and eat. There's nothing wrong with the goal of having plenty of wealth so that they don't need to worry about their finances. But when you've become so sure that nothing bad will happen, what does that do to the entrepreneur? It twists their mind to ensure that more is never enough and from that, they keep climbing a ladder towards nothing. This is a case for a lot of greedy individuals that only think about themselves. They see themselves as a constant target that people will ask more of. In a way, their right. A lot of people will see their wealth and fortune an equal to success. Now the rich man has every right to do what he sees. For the case of John Getty, his personal wealth is in question in All the Money in the World.John Paul Getty (played by Christopher Plummer) is the wealthiest person is history, making his fortune in oil. Though he has everything he's ever wanted (a nice home, art, etc...), he isn't sure if having his family in his life is a part of it. In the 1964, when his adult son John Getty Jr. (played by Andrew Buchan) writes a letter asking for work, his father flies his family out to Rome and offers him the chance to lead the European businesses. At first, things seem to play out well, with John Getty senior even boding with his grandson John Getty III (played by Charlie Plummer). But with every family, comes disagreements.In 1973, teenage John Getty III is kidnapped with a ransom demand of $17 million. His mother Gail Harris (played by Michelle Williams) doesn't receive any alimony from the Getty family, so she doesn't have it. When she tries to get it (or even some of it) from John Getty Sr., he flat out says he'd pay nothing, thinking it's all just a ploy from his grandson for money. Nevertheless, he sends his advisor Fletcher Chase (played by Mark Wahlberg), a former CIA operative to work with Gail to help find her son.All the Money in the World has a lot to say about the Getty family in general. A lot of it centering around the complications that many wealthy families go through when everyone assumes that their all rich. These parts are quite fascinating; John Getty Sr. going through his conflicting love for his grandchildren and his money, Gail trying to prove she's not a greedy individual who simply can't pay, and even John Getty III's trial during his kidnapping. No one is technically a villain. Their all just characters that you either accept or not for their actions. This movie is an actors game, with everyone fantastic. I liked Mark Wahlberg, who understands his position being the heart in-between John Getty's voice of reason and actual help for Gail Harris. I liked Michelle Williams, who carries the pressure from the press who unfairly treats her with anger. The clear winner here is Christopher Plummer (who replaced Kevin Spacey), who could have easily made himself a Scrooge-like miser...and he is, but there a lot more to him. He's a king who hates that people want a lot out of him, but his weakness for his grandchildren does push a possible spot for family he wasn't sure he wanted. What does prevent All the Money in the World from being one of my favorites of 2017 is the tone and pacing. The movie is at it's best when it's more of a detective scenario with Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams, constantly putting together the pieces to find her son. While I understand that a lot of movies need to change for dramatic effect, I don't fully buy the more ""action"" aspects of the story (I won't give it away, but it feels like something from a spy thriller then a retelling of a kidnapping).I'll give this eight Getty Museums out of ten. I like the story of John Getty and his family. I like the story of his grandson's kidnapping. Do I like this movie? I did, though I still feel like that a documentary or book of the ordeal would be more straightforward. I still recommend the movie however. It's a little longer then needed, but it's entertaining. Give it a go and see if this is really worth all of the money in the world.",All the Money in the World

74,bankofmarquis,Fairly bland - with the exception of Christopher Plummer,7,14 February 2018,"By now, almost everyone knows about the last minute switch of Christopher Plummer in place of current-pariah Kevin Spacey as pivotal Billionaire J. Paul Getty in Ridley Scott's ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD, so when I checked out Plummer's Oscar nominated turn, I couldn't but help see if I could tell when Scott put in a new scene and where he just ""augmented"" his scenes with Plummer. And then, a funny thing happened...I stopped looking at this for I was captivated by Plummer's performance.A 3 time Oscar nominee (he is the oldest person to win an Academy Award - at the age of 82 - for his Supporting Role in BEGINNERS in 2010), the 88 year old Plummer shows that he can still command a movie for anytime he is on screen this film crackles and becomes interesting.Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the rest of the film.Telling the story of the kidnapping of Getty's grandson, and the ""richest man in the world's"" refusal to pay the ransom, ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD stars Charlie Plummer (no relation) as John Paul Getty III (the kidnapped grandson), Mark Wahlberg as ""fixer"" Fletcher Chase, who was told by Getty to get his grandson back for ""the lowest possible cost"", Romain Duris as one of the kidnappers and the great Michelle Williams as the mother of the kidnapped boy - and the daughter-in-law of Getty, Gail Harris. Each one of these performances are good, but not great. Doing what needs to be done in what they are given to do but nothing more.I think the problem with this film is one of focus. It spends about 50% of the time with William's character - and this is fine, but then it jumps to the kidnapped son, to ""the fixer"", to ""the kidnapper"", to the grandson and back to the mother, so no real through-line, continuity or strong character development can occur, with the exception of Christopher Plummer's J. Paul Getty. To be fair to Williams, C. Plummer has the showier role and she is just asked to be the center of this tale, the world in which all else revolves and that, ultimately, makes her character somewhat bland.I place the blame for this on Screenwriter David Scarpa (based on the book by John Pearson) and Director Scott. I think their reach exceeded their grasp on this one. If they could have focused more on one of the characters - instead of spreading things out - perhaps this film would have become more interesting and less bland. It stays on one note - despite jumping to different people in vastly different situations - throughout it's 2 hour and 15 minute time frame.All in all, a missed opportunity. It is a decent film that had the potential to be VERY good. The only one who was VERY good was Christopher Plummer - and certainly his performance is worth the price of admission.Letter Grade: B7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (OfMarquis)",All the Money in the World
75,joebloggscity,"Compelling but dark tale, fighting every corner going including your own....",7,4 December 2018,"For those aware of the name Getty, you know that wealth seeps off of it. This true tale of the kidnapping and prolonged set of attempts to free the kidnapped Getty grandson is one uncomfortable watch.The basis is that we have two people, the mother and a security manager, who are banging their heads against the wall trying to help the victim whilst the grandfather with all the money is more concerned about his pennies. Granted he has some points but appears to be cold hearted. The father is simply stoned out of his head and sidelined.Not all as it seems, as all come out of this poor, and there are complications and difficulties. The Italian mafia clan who have kidnapped the grandson are frustrated but committed. That doesn't help. There are some gruesome moments but not too much.This is a study and investigation into the corruption of wealth on the mindset. John Paul Getty is wonderfully played by Christopher Plummer as the cold hearted oligarch with the dysfunctional family, but really he does love his kidnapped grandson, maybe the only one person he does love.The film can feel a bit long but at least it tries to be honest. It's a tough viewing but very good. As it's a true story you can't argue with it, and with some good hands directing it you will find it intriguing.Only real complaint is that the Italians are portrayed too poorly across the board, that is a bit of a cliche.Probably Wahlberg's best performance to date, but also Michelle Williams as the mother is excellent too.

76,bob-the-movie-man,You can't take it with you.,7,18 April 2018,"The big talking point of this Ridley Scott film is not of course the film itself but the fact that the disgraced Kevin Spacey (""Baby Driver"") was 'airbrushed' out of the movie, replaced by the legend that is Christopher Plummer. With that background, and the fact that the re-shoot only took 9 days (NINE DAYS!!!!), I must admit to having been a tad scornful when Plummer was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. ""Oh"" I thought ""...it's Judi Dench's minimalistic performance in 'Shakespeare In Love' all over again"".But actually on watching the film I take it all back. Plummer's role is not, like Dench's, a mere eight minutes of screen time, but extensive and pivotal. Not only was his nomination richly deserved (his performance is cold, eerie and magnificent!) but Ridley Scott deserved an award for getting so much great footage in the can in such a short space of time.The film tells the true story of John Paul Getty III (Charlie Plummer, no relation), grandson to the richest man in the world John Paul Getty I. While in the Piazza Farnese in Rome, JPGIII is kidnapped and a $17 million reward is sought for his release. Whilst claiming to love his offspring, the tycoon is basically a 'tight git' and the film concerns the battle of the young heir's mother Gail (Michelle Williams, ""Manchester By The Sea""; ""The Greatest Showman"") to persuade JPG1 and his right-hand negotiator Fletcher Chase (Mark Wahlberg, ""Patriot's Day"", ""Deep Water Horizon"") to shake the money tree* and get JPGIII released.*To be fair, JPGIII hasn't exactly helped his case as it emerges he had previously joked about getting himself kidnapped to get his grandfather's ransom money!As I didn't remember the historical outcome of this, I was in a suitable amount of suspense as to where it would go. It is clear though, from the wiki version of the story, that the ending was significantly 'sexed-up' for the movie.Ridley Scott sensibly balances the views of the Getty's with the views of the kidnappers, with a semi-sympathetic Italian (Romain Duris) being the focus of those scenes in rural Calabria.But it's the scenes with Plummer that really engage. The man as portrayed is an enigma, eccentrically washing his own clothes to save a few pennies and always (ALWAYS) trying to get 20% more on even the most personal of decisions. It makes me really intrigued to see Spacey's portrayal now... I wonder if the alternate cut might make it onto the Blu-ray? I actually think though that Plummer was the better choice for this: I could see Spacey bringing far too much of Frank Underwood to the role.Elsewhere in the cast, I think Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg are both solid without ever being spectacular and it's nice to see the talented Andrew Buchan (""The Mercy""; ""Broadchurch"") in a more memorable big screen outing as JPG2: his drug-addled son (and JPG3's father).Overall, it's an interesting watch and had me sufficiently engaged to want to watch it again.

Originally Kevin Spacey was cast as the ruthless oil businessman. Indeed he shot all his scenes. Sexual allegations against Spacey arose and the role was recast with veteran Christopher Plummer having the role. That decision perhaps was good and should have originally been made. Plummer has gravitas in the role because of his age and I can't imagine Spacey having such gravitas.Other cast members Michelle Williams (as the distraught mother) and Mark Wahlberg also offer good accounts as well as Charlie Plummer (no relation to Christopher) as John Paul Getty III.

This story was new to me, so I was fascinated to learn about the outcome. Following Gail Harris, a worried mother who will do nothing until her son's kidnappers are either caught or paid, All the Money in the World is a slow-burn in comparison to its premise. Taking its time to set up the core story throughout the first act, we get to understand how cruel of a man John Paul Getty (Gail's father) really was. Being a billionaire and refusing to give up the 17 million being asked for, this film becomes more of a puzzle of how to accomplish this big task and bring her son home. While the story itself is very engaging, the pacing itself is where the film began to lose me at times.Yes, when the film reaches its third act, it fires on all cylinders and never lets go of its audience until the credits roll. That being said, the first two acts of this film involve a lot of conversations on how to accomplish goals and taking many phone calls with the kidnappers. The dialogue is very well-written and keeps you engaged throughout the course of the entire film, but I feel that the movie itself was about 20 minutes too long and certain sequences could've easily been trimmed down, making for a much more exciting film. Not that this is supposed to be an exciting story or anything, but the kick was missing for me.When it comes to performing for the cameras, Christopher Plummer, Michelle Williams, and Mark Wahlberg are all names that we've heard countless times throughout the years. Plummer makes you hate his character, Williams truly makes you feel for her portrayal as this concerned mother, and Wahlberg does his schtick as well as ever. In terms of performers taking you through this story, I can't say I have any complaints, the trailers for this movie will always make me revert back to my pacing argument.Upon release of the first major trailer for this movie, it was cut together like a music video, making audiences believe they're in for a rollicking thriller from beginning to end when in reality, the trailer very briefly defines the third act. The marketing team for this film has done a great job of getting people interested, but it's not okay to lie about the tone. I didn't let this affect my experience of the film itself, but I felt that should've been noted.In the end, All the Money in the World isn't the type of movie that will be re-watchable in the coming years (at least in my opinion), but if you're unfamiliar with this story or have been wanting a film to be made about it, I fell that you'll be satisfied with the final product. Everyone comes to play here, even in the solid direction by director Ridley Scott (which I feel was odd for him to take this film on in general). I can't tell you to rush out to the theatres for this one, but it's definitely worth an eventual watch. Solid flick.",All the Money in the World
81,tm-sheehan,Fate possibly placed the right actor in the JPGetty role? we may never know.,8,15 February 2018,"Another extraordinary movie in more ways than one ,there are 2 complete versions, one we may never see with Kevin Spacey in the role of John Paul Getty and this one with Christopher Plummer and interestingly the role of his grandson JP Getty the 3rd is played so well by Charlie Plummer ,no relation at all to Christopher.
Spacey had completed film but the sexual misconduct allegation charges against him made it impossible for the Producers to release the film.
The entire cast of principals had to be recalled at millions of dollars extra to shoot every scene Kevin Spacey appeared in only 6 weeks before the release date..
I didn't know the story outcome at all and while the screenplay is based on some fact there have been embellishments made to the story I found out later when I read the true facts but they fit in well to make a more dramatic movie.
Michelle Williams is always impressive and plays Paulo's John Paul Getty the 3rds mother in an almost lovingly detached way but at the same time with a desperation to obtain the kidnap ransom to free her son.
I'd love to see the Kevin Spacey version but I suspect fate placed the best actor in the roll Christopher Plummer is superb , except the for the younger flashbacks in which he is far too old in appearance, Spacey would have had to be made up to look over 80 but it's impossible to make an 89 year old actor look 25 years older, they should have used a younger look alike.
Christopher Plummer is nominated for best supporting actor and deserves it but he's already won in 2011 for a far lesser acting role (in my view) in Beginners playing Hal a late out of the closet gay dad with cancer.
He plays J.P. Getty the meanest billionaire and most deluded miser I've seen on screen for years.
I read up about him and the film seems factual regarding his love of money and possessions.
I recall a fabulous day visiting The Getty Museum in Los Angeles in 2006 and staring in awe and wondering how one man could have accumulated such treasures , now I know.
Like every human being on the planet we eventually leave all possessions and money behind so I think the moral if any of this film is your reputation after you've gone is more important than any material wealth you enjoy while you're alive and when I researched what happened to the surviving Getty's after the movie the Movie could have been titled Getty's Curse.",All the Money in the World
82,brankovranjkovic,"All the Money in the World, you will ask 'would you want to be stinking rich but lonely?'",7,8 January 2018,"Kidnapping drama based on a true story, set in 1973. John Paul Getty was the richest man in the world (in the history of the world). His 16 year old grandson was kidnapped in Rome and held captive in the countryside in squalid conditions. The ransom was $17 million, loose change! Although Getty wouldn't pay and wouldn't negotiate. The reason given is that he didn't want to set a president for ransoms on his other grandchildren.The film follows the five month ordeal as the tension builds, especially after the grandson was 'sold' to the mafia. Will Getty pay the Mafia? What will the new kidnappers do? We learn that in order to evade tax Getty couldn't actually spend his wealth, however, he could put his money into trusts and invest into incredibly valuable art, sculptures and buildings.The film is surrounded by controversy. Particularly Kevin Spacey, who was replaced by Christopher Plummer after sexual misconduct allegations and the finished film becomes un-releasable. So all scenes with Spacey (the majority of the film) needed to be reshot quickly.

83,MrDHWong,An interesting and involving story of a rich man's greed and a woman's undying love for her son,8,4 January 2018,"All The Money In The World is a crime thriller starring Christopher Plummer, Michelle Williams, and Mark Wahlberg, directed by Ridley Scott. Based on the true story of the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III in the 1970s, it is an interesting and involving story of a rich man's greed and a woman's undying love for her son.In 1973, teenager John Paul Getty III (Charlie Plummer), the grandson of billionaire oil tycoon J. Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer), is abducted while on holiday in Rome. The kidnappers demand a ransom of $17 million or Getty III will be murdered. Despite the desperate pleas from his mother Gail (Michelle Williams), J. Paul Getty refuses to pay a cent to the kidnappers.Well-acted and suspenseful, All The Money In The World is another solid entry in Ridley Scott's directorial library, even if it does tend to sensationalise certain moments of the real event. Surprisingly though, the film shows little of how the media at the time handled the event and chooses to focus mainly on the Getty family members and what they went through instead. Christopher Plummer, in a role originally played by the now-disgraced Kevin Spacey, does a fantastic job playing the powerful and wealthy J. Paul Getty and successfully showcases to the audience the character's warped mindset on his value of money over family. Michelle Williams was also great as Getty III's mother Gail. Her concern for the well-being of her child and her annoyance of her ex-father-in-law's stubbornness feel genuine and consistent throughout the film.I rate it 8/10",All the Money in the World
84,Alexander_Blanchett,Quite underrated hostage drama,9,24 February 2018,"I really liked it. One of Ridley Scott's better films. Historically not 100% accurate but it still makes a very tense and exciting family/hostage drama. Of course the film became famous because of the last minute Christopher Plummer replacement when all of Kevin Spacey's scenes were reshoot. This proved as one of the films best decisions, because Plummer delivers a fabulous performance as family patriarch Juan Paul Getty. Perfect cast and absolutely standout. Also Michelle Williams deserves way more credit than she received for her heartbreaking performance as the mother who tries everything to get her son released. A great character for Williams where she could soak her teeth in and give a very individual face to it. Great work. Mark Wahlberg was the weakest of the trio but by far not as bad as many make him out to be. I actually think his performance was quite well. Charlie Plummer as the hostage victim John Paul Getty III was okay but sometimes a bit annoying. His counterpart Romain Duris stole evey scene they shared. The film was very well crafted, had a very controled direction. Not over the top and not over styled. It had a good score and nice cinematography. Very good and entertaining history lesson.",All the Money in the World
85,CANpatbuck3664,"Great Acting Paired With an Interesting Story, Ridley Scott has Another Winner",8,27 December 2017,"I walked into this movie knowing almost nothing about the Getty empire or the particulars of this story. The trailers and the talent involved were the selling points for me so I'm happy to report that even though I went in blind, I didn't have any problems keeping up with the story. The premise is simple in which an oil tycoon's grandson is kidnapped to extort money for a terrorist organization. It's not the premise that makes this worth seeing, its what they do with it and how they build off of it that makes All the Money in the World worthwhile.Being based on a true story, there was material to mine in this story. I think they did a good job of showing characters that seemed out there as being realistic. I heard so many gasps in the theatre when John Paul Getty was shirking Gail or trying to haggle to get JP back. My thought during that was ""wow, he's a terrible person but I could see someone with his wealth acting like that."" People value different things and Getty is a corrupted person who doesn't understand what other people think is invaluable. I also liked how unapologetic Richard was over his actions, he's really good at his job and what he does for a living isn't very nice. Sure, JP was a little bratty but he sure got the message by the end. JP tells us how his family looks human, acts human but they aren't fully human. This movie gets how to show how wealth changes behaviour and why so many of the characters act unnaturally throughout the movie.This is another movie that uses the fact that its set in the past in a beautiful location to its full advantage. This movie pulls of the feat of making parts of Italy look gorgeous in some scenes and so grimy and seedy in others. Ridley Scott experiments with the cinematography, some early scenes are in black and white instead of colour. The transition between them is seamless and while it isn't always easy to understand, it looks cool. The costuming seems period accurate and the sterility in the visuals that Scott sometimes has is put to good use here.Other than Ridley Scott's slick direction and some excellent window dressing with the cinematography and the period piece trappings, the reason to see this is the excellent acting. Michelle Williams is underrated, I think everyone knows how talented she is but she's not the first actress you think of when you think of regular powerhouse performances. She's easily one of the top ten leading ladies working in drama right now and I think she could garner another Oscar nomination for her work here. I really liked Mark Wahlberg in this even if I was a little let down by his character (more on that later). He's very calm and collected and he's equally at ease when he's trying to comfort Gail or threatening communists. I actually wished we could have spent more time with his character and you can credit Wahlberg for that. The actor that's going to get the headlines from this though is Christopher Plummer. He deserves them though, he totally inhabits this larger-than-life character and he's interesting even at his most disgraceful. I know he had to come in as a replacement for Kevin Spacey but when you watch him, it's hard to imagine another actor doing as good of a job. He's definitely going to garner an Oscar nomination if not a win. I also want to credit Charlie Plummer as JP Getty III and Romain Duris as Cinquanta in their supporting parts. Charlie brings elicits sympathy for John Paul and his scenes with Romain make you care about their relationship even if its between a kidnapper and his victim. I don't have a ton of complaints with this movie. I wanted some more from some of the characters. They really setup Fletcher Chase as a bad@$$ former spy and I wanted to see more of him in his element. I don't need gunfights, just more of seeing him do what he does best. It seemed to me like there was more initially written for that character to do and it got cut out. I also would have liked a little more time with with Gail and John Paul III setting up their relationship after his father's disappearance. The other complaint is that the move drags in the middle with the long run time. I was fully invested in this movie at around the 1hr mark and there was a point where it stopped being this breathtaking thriller and started to coast.You have to admire Scott's devotion to this movie, he had to make serious changes on the fly just to keep this alive. I don't think this is the best Scott movie (he's made a lot of good ones, but I would still put The Martian ahead of this) but I think this is a beautiful and stylish thriller that doesn't lack for thrills or acting talent. Its absolutely worth seeing in a theatre and even if you don't recognize the story, you'll appreciate it still. I would actually put this somewhere in the range of 8-8.5/10 but I have to round down to an 8.",All the Money in the World
86,statuskuo,Rich People Are Cold,4,3 January 2018,"It seems Ridley Scott is beginning to slide into his Irish roots and feel guilty for the wealth he has acquired. Being not as stinking rich as John Paul Getty, you almost feel he needs to justify his own short-comings of being just rich and NOT wealthy. Because being wealthy means being a cheap S.O.B.
The story is of his grandson being kidnapped and ransomed for $17 million bucks. Those numbers go down as Getty negotiates with young Paul Getty III's mother Gail Getty that his life isn't what's on the table. But a deal. Yes, a miserly scrooge needs to take all that is on the table. And then steal from your plate as well. There is never enough. And much like Charles Foster Kane, is buried in the shadow of his own wealth and using it to intimidate. The fact for insanely wealthy people like Getty is that they spend much more of their lives building a legacy rather than raising a family. One they don't deserve. It's as if a pauper and a prince treat their heirs with the same dismissive wave of a hand. Except one sends their kin to boarding school in Italy.The biggest issue I have about this movie is that the story isn't that interesting for being about a rich kid being ransomed for money. There isn't the excitement that better filmmaker Tony Scott didn't mine in ""Man on Fire."" It might as well, because the details are laughable. Zippo tension, annoying mother (Michelle Williams) and a villainy Kevin Space...er...I mean Christopher Plummer that boasts that he learned the script in time to shoot. Yeah, pal...sounds like it. It's not anything he hasn't pulled off in other movies that require him to be Max Von Sydow. This movie is a slog through how wealthy people function. And it's not fun. The kid who plays Paul Getty III is annoying, so I wished the kidnappers would put a bullet in his stupid gay face. All the money in the world couldn't get me to recommend this to the most die hard of Scott's fans.",All the Money in the World
87,davidgee,The movie not starring Kevin Spacey,6,11 January 2018,"Ridley Scott revisits the kidnapping of teenager John Paul Getty III by Calabrian gangsters in 1973. JP's parents are divorced; his father JPG II is zonked out on pot and other drugs in Morocco, but he has a devoted mother (Michelle Williams). His zillionaire grandfather JPG the First (Christopher Plummer) refuses to pay the $17 million ransom and tells his ex-CIA security chief (Mark Wahlberg) to rescue the boy.The opening credits tell us this is ""inspired by real events"". A few liberties have been taken with the facts as most of us remember them, especially towards the end of the movie. One delicious fact is the British Telecom payphone guests are obliged to use in the hall of Getty's magnificent Tudor mansion in Surrey.Christopher Plummer is excellent if somewhat OTT as the Scrooge-like mogul. The pace is good, with lots of fast cutting between the family and the kidnappers. It's an okay movie, even a good movie, but it's not in the league of Scott's epic GLADIATOR (which, let's not forget, heavily recycled the plot of BEN HURr).The big story with ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD is of course the surgical removal of Kevin Spacey from the first final print following his ""fall from grace"". I read that Spacey's bio-pic of Gore Vidal is now unlikely to be released - a story I'd very much like to see. Is his back-list also going to be shelved, meaning that we will never again see AMERICAN BEAUTY or THE USUAL SUSPECTS? Will Harvey Weinstein's output (including PULP FICTION, KILL BILL and -one of my all-time favourites - SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE) also disappear from TV screens and online video stores? However vile the ""crimes"" these two men (and others) have been accused of (and found guilty in the court of public opinion), it surely does not totally degrade the work they - and everyone else involved in those productions - have achieved?Only asking.",All the Money in the World
88,PyroSikTh,"An Enjoyable Thriller, with Little Else to Note Beyond the Reshoots",7,30 January 2018,"All the Money in the World is about the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III in the early 70s, and his grandfather's stubbornness not to pay the ransom despite being the richest man ""in the history of the world"". It's down to his mother, an ex-CIA negotiator hired by Getty Sr, and the Italian police to get the youngest JPG back to safety. While the kidnapping is the catalyst and drives most the story, the kidnappers themselves are not the main antagonists. Instead All the Money focusses on Getty Sr's reluctance to pay, and the frustration and anguish Gail, the kidnappers, and the media/public get from it. No-one can understand why the richest man in the world won't fork over penny-change to get his grandson back. A kidnapping that was only planned to last a few days takes months, Gail feels she's fighting Getty Sr as much as the kidnappers, and the media are just having a field day with the whole thing.There isn't really any subtext to All the Money. It's literally just about the kidnapping and Getty's stubbornness. It does paint an interesting picture of greed, and the effect it has on Getty though. He often seems more concerned with the stock market than his own family. He's lived a long life of gaining riches by always negotiating and not settling for any more than the bottom line for anything, and he extends this tactic to the kidnapping, to the behest of those around him. Of course anyone familiar with the story will know his tactic does work in the end, but not until it's too late.On the note of the reshoots, All the Money is simply impressive. Justice League take notes, this is how you do reshoots. Every single scene containing Kevin Spacey was replaced with a near-identical scene of Christopher Plummer over the course of eight days of filming, less than a month before wide release. Without knowing this background information, you wouldn't be able to tell. What's more impressive is how much of the movie this actually entails. It must be a good thirty percent of the runtime! Christopher Plummer is simply fantastic, performing as Getty as if he had all the time in the world to do it. He lives in the role despite the lightning-fast production time he had. He brings a warmth and complexity to Getty that I can't imagine Spacey bringing, as while Getty is reluctant to pay, he does still care about his grandson. He manages to exude a sense of warmth despite the cold and emotionless things he says, and his eventual giving in is punctualised by Plummer tapping into an inner layer of the character. Not only that, but he wasn't mired by the questionable aging make-up they had to put Spacey under, so that's always a plus. Am I curious to see what Spacey's performance would've been like? Sure, but I somehow doubt it'll be any improvement.Visually is where All the Money gets most of my complaints though. It's a very darkly lit movie, with a high contrast throughout, making the darker details almost indistinguishable. As a Snyder fan you'd think I'd love it, and I admit it does give All the Money a visual quality that looks more polished and elevates it above your run-of-the-mill thrillers. But in my opinion this was too much. It feels unnecessary, adds absolutely nothing to the actual film itself, and results in a loss of certain details.All the Money in the World is not a movie that'll be remembered for all time (at least not on its own merits). It has few stand-out moments, and often feels like Ridley Scott on auto-pilot. Mark Whalberg is good for Mark Whalberg, but he's still Mark Whalberg so that's still not a glowing endorsement. The story is interesting, and the portrayal of Getty as a sympathetic antagonist is enthralling, but the actual kidnapping story itself is nothing special. I give it an enjoyable 7/10.",All the Money in the World

91,bbewnylorac,A great film,8,11 May 2018,"Christopher Plummer gives an apppropriately icy turn as the mean billionaire J Paul Getty, who claims to love his grandson Paul, yet won't pay the ransom to free him after he is kidnapped. In the hands of the ruthless Italian mafia, Paul, played with moving vulnerability by Charlie Plummer, is kept imprisoned in a cave and has his ear cut off. Director Ridley Scott doesn't spare us the gory procedure. It shows how soulless and inhuman the kidnappers are. They cook for their families and dance and don't care that Paul is suffering. Interestingly, like Getty, all they care about is money. The cinematography, both in Italy and at Getty's mansion in England, is mostly washed out and grey, as if to reflect the poor state of the characters' souls. As the private detective Getty hires to find Paul, Mark Wahlberg is a little confusing. He starts off as a faithful Getty servant but later turns on him - swearing at him, which I find hard to believe he would do. 
Paul's mother Gail is the moral centre of the film and with her ex husband, Paul's father JP junior, a drug addled mess, Gail is a tower of strength. As Gail, Michelle Williams is intelligent and understated. Gail actually loves her son, and unlike so many others, will step up and fight to get him back. It's really sad that Getty wasn't able to use his wealth for good. He shirked his duty to his family, and missed out on a lot of love in return, as the scene of a boy Paul, holding Getty's hand as they go through some Roman ruins.",All the Money in the World

First of all, there was absolutely no need to change the story. This shouldn't have been a movie that was ""inspired"" by real events. Meaning, they should have stuck with the actual story, step by step. What happened to John Paul Getty III is absolutely astonishing! Why in the world would they change it is beyond me!

So the devoted mom teams up with the miserly billionaire's security chief (Mark Wahlberg) to locate the kidnappers before it's too late.""All the Money in the World"" is famous for two things. It's based on true events - the Getty family is still among the rich and famous of the world - and the makers suddenly replaced the leading man Kevin Spacey with Christopher Plummer just weeks before the premiere.The reason, of course, was Spacey's involvement in sexual harassment scandal which helped to kickstart the powerful MeToo campaign of harassment victims sharing their stories new and old.Oh my, it's the fourth paragraph already and I'm still not exactly reviewing the movie. What's happened?Well, what's alread written above is actually the most interesting part of the whole thing. Without it, it's just another movie helmed by Ridley Scott.Sure, everything looks good and all the technical aspects are of exemplary quality. Especially the photography and believable 70s atmosphere (costumes, locations etc). But the movie lacks, typically for Scott, one thing that would really make it relevant: heart.Ridley Scott is one of the most famous directors working today, so what do I mean about his movies not having heart?Well, I've seen most of his works, excluding the early stuff, and have long had an impression that he likes to be a great teller of stories in technical sense, but doesn't care that much about the stories getting under our skin.Basically, he likes creating epics of every forms and sizes, but they usually lack a well-developed existential dimension which would make us emotionally relate to what's on screen.""All the Money..."" is good example of this. You will love the 70s vibe and probably find the storyline generally interesting, but is there one character that you really care about?It's quite a long movie, 135 minutes, but there's no character or relationship multi-faceted or well-developed enough to make us invested. It has few strengths as entertainment (period detail, action scenes) but it's only lukewarm as drama or view into the dynamics of powerful family.The rich old Getty could save the movie from shallowness, if we saw more of him and his side of things. How would one be if one was too rich and powerful to depend on others' opinions?As of now, he's just potential for intriguing character, coming off as just a modern version of Ebeneezer Scrooge from Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol"".The comparision seems even stronger, when one considers ""All the Money's"" original release date - December 21, just before Christmas.Yes, the acting is solid all-around, and Plummer is charismatic in his own way, as always. But it's not enough to make the man on the screen intriguing.By the way, I have a hard time believing that Kevin Spacey was discarded from this huge project at so late stage because of the scandal.The director and the producers may have found this to be an suitable official excuse but film industry has probably always been sinful place, and Spacey's story seems hardly shocking by today's standards.There may have been something deeply wrong with Spacey's performance, and/or his relations to the director and/or producers which lead to firing him.The story goes deeper than MeToo campaign, I tells ye!",All the Money in the World

Hampered by CGI and a visually mundane approach, the movie felt like it could be directed by anyone - a disappointment from the boldly innovative Scott. Minus a few somewhat interesting visual sequences, Ridley's decision to replace Kevin Spacey with Christopher Plummer (as JP Getty) forced the seasoned filmmaker to frantically fulfill 9 days of reshoots (although the scenes with Spacey appeared to be overdone with prosthetics.

Wahlberg doesn't bring anything to the table - probably angry he missed his Thanksgiving due to the panicked reshoots. Michelle Williams is the highlight of the film, bringing a nuanced portrayal of Abigail Harris (the kidnapped boy's mother). Unfortunately, due to the hallow screenplay, she her chops are lost within a vacuum of mediocre written scenes. The story of the kidnapping of Paul Getty has potential. Scott was the right pick for the job - although he certainly didn't show up for this one. Chance you'll start looking at your I-phone during home viewing: 88%Ted's Overall

100,austin0731,The billionaires vs the 'everyman',7,7 February 2018,"We have all heard stories of the legendary recovery that director Ridley Scott made upon cutting Kevin Spacey completely out of the film, All the money in the world. And, the mere days that it took to completely replace him with Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, while I feel that this is a fairly decent crime drama I was expecting so much more, granted this film did good on a lot of fronts I just felt that in many points throughout the movie pacing largely damages the quality of the film. Perhaps the effect of the reshoot, I felt that they were awkwardly shot scenes and moments that really took me out of the film. However, all the money in the world does do a great job in conveying several themes, the most important and central of all the theme of money and the different world views of 'the normal people' and 'billionaires'. I thought that this was a fairly interesting difference that has never really been established in other films before, the way that Getty sees money and the constant hunger and need fully personify the central theme of this never ending lust for money. It is truly a fascinating discussion.This of course, supported by the two central actors that personify the conflict, Christopher Plummer's J. Paul Getty and Michele Williams' Gail Harris. Both were wonderful in this film, hence, greatly adding on to this central theme and creating a very interesting dynamic and conflict of interest that extends beyond the actual kidnapping that happens in the film but really explores the extent of which money essentially 'changes' you and the way in which their roles can be so utterly different. None of which could be done without the amazing performance put up by the pair. I thought that the film really played up this sense of cons and striking the best deal, and this sense of insecurity. Thus even though marketed as a kidnapping thriller, the story mainly focuses on how the two characters deal with the situation. While I enjoyed the exchanges and characters and the central idea that stems from the film I must say certain aspects of the execution was not so good. But, still very commendable due to this film's unique circumstances.",All the Money in the World

102,dakjets,A mothers struggle,8,9 July 2018,"I liked this movie very well. It clearly indicates that there are skilled people both in front and behind the camera. In review I read before I saw it, Christopher Plummer's efforts are drawn to be superb. I agree that he is good at the role of the ice-cold Getty, as the film portrays as a brutal and highly calculating person. The money controls everything.But my personal favorite is Michelle Williams as his daughter in law. Once again she takes a key role in a very good way, giving the film both credibility and lifting it with her efforts. Williams is best in scenes with just her father-in-law and his people. She is good as a mother who does everything for her child, but at the same time tackles the raw circumstances she has to fight.Read the least before you see this one. The action is known, as it is based on a true story. The story of the film is therefore quite slow. Instead, we get underlying stories that tell more about the people involved. This makes an interpreter that sees and strengthens the film, in my opinion. The movie is good, so I do not understand the bad reviews.",All the Money in the World
103,cordenw,Are rich people happy?,7,27 December 2019,"No matter how much you've got, there's always something that you want and can't have.
This is the dilemma for the rich and famous, they are so used to having people around them who do exactly what they are told to do, that it's a shock when someone doesn't bend to their will.
They also tend to think that their good luck/talent extends to all aspects of life and so dismiss any form of introspection until it is forced on them.Here we have a portrayal of Mr Getty, well acted by Christopher Plummer, that shows how single mindedness in the pursuit of money and obedience can extinguish all other emotions.No doubt Mr Getty was a brilliant man but underneath that shining light was a very mean and ordinary person who was an unhappy soul.The story plays out with the kidnapping of his grandson and Getty's stubborn refusal to pay a ransom for his return. You have to ask yourself whether it was Getty himself who made it difficult or whether it was the army of lawyers he was always surrounded with.But in the end I think the answer is that he was just a ruthless businessman.The focus of the film is not so much the kidnapping itself but the empty emotional shell that the man was.Acting by Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg is very good but it could have been done by anybody, as it was only secondary to the theme.As I've grown older I realize that being super rich is as miserable for some as being desperately poor .

106,hunter-friesen,A good family drama that doesn't deliver on the action it promised,7,18 March 2018,"Ridley Scott's All the Money in the World has had a troubled production. The biggest problem came from Kevin Spacey, whose sexual assault allegations forced him to be recast and reshoots to commence in record time. Another problem arose when it was revealed that during the reshoots, the two leads, Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams, were paid vastly different sums, which prompted a reaction from the #MeToo movement. Fortunately for Scott, the finished product was not tarnished by the problems and ends up coming out in good quality. The film retells the true story of the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III (Charlie Plummer), grandson of legendary oil tycoon Jean Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer). John is a typical teenager who just wants to spend his days drinking and having fun, which eventually gets him into trouble while he's on vacation in Italy. He's kidnapped by low-level thugs who demand a ransom of $17 million be paid for his safe return. From his luxurious English mansion, Jean refuses to pay the ransom, citing that if he paid a ransom for one grandchild then all of his grandchildren would be kidnapped. While that claim sounds reasonable, it's well known that grandpa was extremely frugal and unwilling to even pay half price for anything. Caught in the middle of this situation is John's mother, Gail Harris (Michelle Williams). She's an outsider in the family, mostly because she's not a real Getty. A war begins to brew between her and Jean as they fight over how to best handle the situation.Marketed as an almost action thriller, the film really isn't as exciting as you want it to be. Some events are overly dramatized to try and build up more excitement. It's as if the screenwriter researched the story, found out that it wasn't that exciting, and decided that there needed to be more action in order to have mainstream appeal. The film also falls into a trap of repeating itself about midway through. A never-ending cycle of debating between the adults and John's situation changing becomes tiresome quickly, resulting in a surprisingly simple story that feels less than its potential. What the film lacks in action it makes up for in thrills and suspense. Scott lets the story flow freely between locations and properly handles the parallel stories of John and the adults.The performances of the film are the highlights as each raise the story past its flaws. The standout performance comes from the man with the least amount of screentime and had the least amount of preparation (about three weeks). Christopher Plummer is award-worthy as Jean Getty, giving his character the right amount of believability and ferocity. Every one of the bests scenes involves him, which is not a coincidence considering how talented Plummer is with his limited time. Both Michelle Williams and Charlie Plummer do well in their roles as mother and son. They 're convincing pair that is smart and resourceful. They both try to fight and make the best of their dire situations that is being worsened by an Ebenezer Scrooge type. Lastly, Mark Wahlberg plays a supporting role as Fletcher Chase, an associate for Jean Getty. He's assigned to negotiate a deal with the kidnappers, but only at Getty's approved price that is far too low. Wahlberg doesn't add much to the overall story and only seems to be there to add star power. He's not bad but just doesn't seem to be worth our time. Throughout all its production and publicity problems, All the Money in the World is a testament to the power of the mega-talented cast and crew. Whether it be the octogenarian pair of Scott and Plummer or the younger core of Williams and Charlie, everyone here steps up their game to deliver a satisfying thriller that is able to move past some of its problems.",All the Money in the World

110,PotassiumMan,Christopher Plummer elevates this drama,7,31 December 2017,"It's hard to conceive of how a film could have gone so wrong with a miscasting so staggering and yet by dumb luck got a second chance and wound up redeeming itself as well as Ridley Scott's film about the kidnapping of oil millionaire J. Paul Getty's grandson in Rome in 1973. In a vacuum, you would never have guessed that Kevin Spacey was ever in this film or that Christopher Plummer was deployed so late and with such haste. That alone makes this film an impressive accomplishment.The truth is that Plummer is the strongest thing about this film, as he fully personifies the tight-fisted Getty who chose to withhold a ransom of $17 million that was demanded in return for his grandson's safety. Plummer perfectly conveys how Getty's ultimate motive was to weigh his own losses, both personal and financial even in dealing with kidnappers. How bad does this film make the Italians look? Only a little better than Getty himself. By the end of the film, you might wonder if the country is still as corrupt and morally derelict as Italian society in the 1970s is portrayed here. Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg are both decent here but they are largely in Plummer's shadow, which is actually appropriate.The film does go on a bit long and becomes somewhat labored toward the end. But it still does a tremendous job of portraying the utterly poisonous influence of money and privilege in family relationships and how tremendous wealth can destroy a family bond. Tough as that may be to absorb, this film conveys it quite well. Gladly recommended.",All the Money in the World

Getty III, the grandson of famous oil magnate Paul Getty was one of the most high profile kidnappings in modern history. At the time, Getty was the world's wealthiest person with his fortune built on early contracts for oil extraction in the Middle East. Hollywood has a tendency to excessively mythologize such events but ""All the Money in the World"" stuck mostly to the facts of what happened.Getty III (Charlie Plummer) was only 16 and living a bohemian lifestyle with minimal parental restrictions when he was abducted from the streets of Rome by Italian mobsters who demanded a $17 million ransom (over $100M in today's money). Getty Sr (Christopher Plummer - no relation to Charlie) initially rejects the kidnappers' demands citing that he had 14 grandchildren and he didn't want to create a precedent. Getty family relations were complicated by Getty Jr (Andrew Buchan) and wife Abigail (Michelle Williams) divorcing earlier due to Getty Jr's dissolute drug taking lifestyle. Getty Sr, known to be ruthlessly stingy, believed his hired negotiator Fletcher Chace's (Mark Wahlberg) initial take that Getty III had faked his own kidnapping. After months of fruitless negotiating, gangsters higher up the food chain forced the issue by having a portion of Getty IIII's ear sliced off and sent to a newspaper editor. This jarred Getty Sr into real negotiating and, kicked along by some savvy tactics by an impatient mother, after 6 months of horrendous treatment (only partially shown in the movie), Getty III is finally released.The superb acting by the leads easily papers over the liberties taken with the true storyline to make this a gripping and compelling movie. Christopher Plummer was stunning as the aloof and greedy Getty Sr and his Oscar nominated performance (the oldest person nominated in history) was all the more impressive given he was a late ring-in to cover for the disgraced Kevin Spacey after most of the movie had been shot. Michelle Williams was fantastic portraying the steely nerve required to negotiate with the world's richest man and his array of legal talent headed up Oswald Hinge (Timothy Hutton - to date the youngest male actor Oscar winner). Charlie Plummer was perfectly cast as the glamorous playboy grandson eventually devastated by his awful ordeal and he puts in a characteristically excellent performance.Ridley Scott did well - casting was superb, period costuming and props were excellent and the pace was spot on.",All the Money in the World
113,hoernkeem,"All the Money in the World (2017, Ridley Scott) Plummer steps in to save what is a pretty decent movie",7,11 February 2021,"All the Money in the World (2017, Ridley Scott)
So this would seem like a pretty good, end of year, awards type of prestige picture. Based on a 1995 book this tells of, at the time, the richest man not just in the world but the richest man who ever lived, J. Paul Getty. One of his grandchildren is abducted in Italy and held for ransom and he famously refused, initially, to pay anything to secure his grandson's release. An A list cast and an A list director combine to give this all the makings of a good film, however, it has been overshadowed by its production which originally had Kevin Spacey as J. Paul Getty. Following Spacey's public disgrace regarding sexual misconduct allegations Ridley Scott decided to reshoot all his parts and scrub him from the film. In stepped Christopher Plummer doing an admirable job sinking his teeth into rich, miserly Getty and making his inclusion in the film seamless. It is actually funny because in watching the film I think Plummer does such a good job I don't know why Spacey was ever tapped for the role. It seems so burdensome to layer makeup on him to age him when Plummer sells the role all on its own, but alas I guess we will never see how the role would have been interpreted by Spacey. All that being said and known this is actually a pretty decent film and one that despite its historical context I did not actually know the outcome to in real life. The mother of the abducted J.P. Getty III, Gail Harris, played by Michelle Williams, is in a constant back and for the with the old man trying to secure funds for her son's release and at the same time she is in communication through the police with the kidnappers attempting to bring them down from an original astronomical value that she couldn't hope to get her hands on while also convincing them to keep her son alive. We also get snippets of the young Paul in captivity as he attempts to survive with his kidnappers as they become more and more agitated as time drags on. Mark Wahlberg rounds out the cast playing Fletcher Chase who is a Getty Oil negotiator and former CIA operative. Getty sends him to handle both Gail and the situation. This was interesting enough to watch this surreal family melodrama play out on such a grandiose stage. Intriguing as well are the super odd family dynamics of the Getty's. The entire abduction plot was really only a mildly interesting one but framed what was truly interesting which was John Paul Getty's handling of the situation, and it really becomes a character study on him specifically even if he didn't dominate screen time. So kudos go to Plummer for a masterful portrayal of quite an odd, unscrupulous character but the film overall only is slightly above average as far as the actual plot and story goes.

114,dale-51649,"Grandson of a billionaire gets kidnapped, movie is a PC version of the actual events",2,8 June 2018,"The film is based on the real life kidnapping of John Paul Getty the third. He was the grandson John Paul Getty who was at the time the richest man in the world. The acting is good, especially by the mom and the kid who plays the victim. However, the writers take a very interesting story and turn it into a Lifetime Network knockoff. I was in middle school at the time the real story was unfolding, and we were all freaked out by how cheap the grandfather seemed, what with the severed ear and all. The fact he had a pay phone in his palace said a lot too. Over time I learned that he had a stable of eight girlfriends living with him, and he liked to see them fight with each other , over him. That the movie would leave this part out shows how far down the rabbit hole we are. Even the TV show, ""Trust"", included the girls, and it was far better for it. It's as though they had to portray the old man as miserable at all costs, because he wasn't that into kids and family.""Those kids are my blood, AND SHE TOOK THEM,"" John Paul Getty scoffs...oh pleeeeze... he was chasing 8 hotties around the estate and is rumored to have had the first working pre viagra med. It was a different time, and people didn't used to even pretend they were obsessing over their kids. They portray the mom being the master mind of the ransom negotiation. They also show her living pretty well but never doing any actual work, so you wonder who is paying her bills. At the time all this took place, most people had an attitude that ""children should be seen and not heard"", but the writers airbrush this out and fill in today's social milieu. They also show the mom gaining control of all the money after the old man's death, so it fits perfectly into the narrative ""evil man ends up dead and single mom gets his jack"" (sound familiar?) They exclude many real life facts including moms marriage to a B movie star and living in a villa in Brentwood with him, so makes you wonder about accuracy of the story.The fact that Hollywood would edit out real life and airbrush in a current day PC version, complete with a moral is kind of ironic, considering the first casting couch is over 100 years old now, and divorce and kids being raised by nannies is their norm.

You cannot overlook what an accomplishment this performance is on Plummer's part. He was brought in at the last second onto a project that he had had nothing to do with beforehand. He had to read the script, understand the character, and figure out the nuances of his performance all in a matter of days. The fact that he was able to bring as much dimension to the character as he did with as little time as he had to do it in is just mindblowing. And his last-minute integration into an already finished film is almost seamless. Minus one scene where he was obviously digitally inserted into the shot, the movie flows without any hiccups. It's an amazing feat on Ridley Scott's part, one that proves his dexterity as a director. But Christopher Plummer is easily the best part of this movie, and I have no doubt that he will garner himself a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the Academy Awards this year.

Or maybe, as with several of Ridley Scott's films, I need to re-watch it a year or two later to fully enjoy it without intrusive knowledge about things that happened during the filming.I had heard that the actors were not told about the alien bursting from John Hurt's chest, so I spent a large portion of my first viewing of Alien waiting for that scene, and couldn't really remember much that happened afterward. I was hyper conscious of Oliver Reed's death during the filming of Gladiator, and the fact that several of his scenes featured discarded shots of his face computer-mapped onto the face of a stand-in, so I was unable to properly enjoy that film until the Special Edition came out on DVD.So, inevitably, I watched All The Money In The World with an eye to Chris Plummer's hastily re-shot scenes (following Kevin Spacey's much publicised deletion), rather than the immersion I generally like to employ in the watching of a film. The net result was that I can't remember much about it other than Plummer's scenes - all of which were very good, by the way.I was left with a lasting impression that it had been a good film, and one that I would definitely like to see again, as it depicts the thoroughly bizarre and gripping true story of the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III (father of Balthazar Getty) and the refusal of his father (played by Plummer) to pay the ransom, despite being a billionaire worth over 9 billion dollars. A little light Googling provides an excellent insight into the Getty dynasty, and the crazy events that surrounded them.I'm sure, based on the calibre of the director and cast, that this film did an excellent job depicting the kidnapping and aftermath. I just can't seem to remember much detail, other than the scenes with Christopher Plummer and a few other random moments.So who knows?

The main problem that I have with this film is it is overwhelmingly plot-driven to the point where there wouldn't be much to return to for a second viewing once you've experienced the inherent thrills of the story on an initial viewing. The acting is serviceable, at times even quite good, but the characterization is lacking a bit. I feel like we didn't really get to know these characters beyond the plot they were embroiled in which lessened the dramatic tension.

123,jeannefrancoise,Dramatization of a rich,7,18 January 2018,"Dear readers, this movie is about the kidnapping of JP Getty III that popularly linked with the relation of US-Italy at that time. This movie is also about how is getting rich with oil industry in the 1970s. While watching this movie, I did not expect to watch the rich life of JP Getty because for me the title is attractive: ""All the Money in the World"". I expected to watch some kind of political conspiracy or some surprising plot about extraordinary crime, but this movie is about JP Getty, well, after watching the movie until in the middle of the plot, finally I can enjoy the story. First is about the title. I can understand now why Ridley Scott chose the specific title about money because the negotiation and bargaining will dominate the whole plot of the movie. Until the ending, the audience will guess what is and how is the best bargain to save life of JP Getty III. Second is about the character development. Well, the mother of JP Getty III, that played by Michelle Williams, is amazing. From the first time that she is just a mother and a housewife, but then she is becoming the central of the plot story. Do not get it wrong. This movie is about the kidnapping of JP Getty III, but the whole plot is about the love of mother of her own son, so Michelle Williams will be the central of the story. I also want to appreciate Scott to choose Christopher Plummer as Mr. Getty. His face, his words, and his figure are really representing rich man from oil industry in the era of 1970s. The appearance of Mark Wahlberg is not so dominant among Michelle Williams and Christopher Plummer. The third thing I would to review is about the cinematography. Italy is amazing scene for movies. UK also, but this movie is also about Italy, how Italians live, how they are seeing American people, why Italian police is appeared many times, and we can see some Italian mafia or gangster like in Godfather movies. I can imagine also Scott spent so much dollars to live up the scene, the luxury places, houses, house in mountains, great wardrobe, etc. This movie is Scott's, so we never regret. I just critic one thing about the logic of the story. I know this movie is based on true events, but I think dramatization in this movie is better than the real life, so this is just the little weakness, but this movie can be pioneer for the next movies of ""real story"" of rich person.

This movie is a testament to that. The acting is outstanding, you really feel like you are there. The mood of Italy and Europe of the 1970s infuses the film. Terrorism is in the air with the Munich Olympics of 1972, the Red Brigades and Baader-Meinhof gang. The depiction of Getty the oil magnate is shown to us by his various statements and actions. A truly gothic character. The gangster kidnappers are also frightening in their normal everyday lives that accept criminality as if it were like a walk in the park.

130,Metaflix,An overambitious script and poor cinematography drag down this intriguing story,6,5 January 2018,"Even Michelle Williams couldn't save 'All the Money in the World.' Based on the true story of the 1973 kidnapping of John Paul Getty III, the script was promising enough to attract the likes of Ms. Williams, Kevin Spacey, Mark Wahlberg, and several other notable character actors. However, the framework ultimately proved to be overambitious, as evidenced by the non-linear structure that was abandoned halfway through the film and the unnecessarily long runtime.Director Ridley Scott was put in a difficult situation as a result of Kevin Spacey's avalanche of sexual assault accusations, and handled it admirably by cutting the actor's scenes from the film. The role was then re-cast and re-shot with Christopher Plummer as J. Paul Getty, who was recently nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance. My biggest problem with the movie was the cinematography. Most of the film was shot with a blue filter, and while this in itself isn't an issue, certain accommodations on set--such as specific lighting--need to be made. This obviously didn't happen with 'All the Money in the World,' and as a result, countless scenes were drearily flat, if not entirely washed out.",All the Money in the World

132,Ingrouille181,Just the film I needed to see in theatres,7,23 January 2018,"I hardly go to theatres to see non-blockbuster/Superhero/Horror movies, and the first one I did see was 2016's The Light Between Oceans. That was the first film like that I saw, difference between this and that is one, it's not boring as hell, and two, it's based on a true story; truly proving that real life is scarier than fiction.The story focuses on the kidnapping and ransoming of Paul Getty III, the grandson of Paul Getty Sr., who was by the 1970's, one of the richest people alive. Things take a dark turn however when Getty Sr. refuses to pay his grandsons ransom, and his mother is desperate to find the money, whether raising it herself, or pleading for Getty pay it himself.We're all aware of the Kevin Spacey controversy, and really the ""oh so SHOCKING"" Hollywood scandals, so they had to recast the role of Getty with Christopher Plummer. Even though Spacey no doubt would have been great in the role, Plummer is great as a replacement. He really sells the character of a withered man fed up with the people around him scrounging him for his fortune. You can understand why he doesn't pay the ransom, even with the people around him condemning him. The scene where you think he's handing over the ransom money, but it turns out to be money for an art piece he's purchasing; really shows he cares more for antiques than his family.Everyone else is really good. I especially loved Michelle Williams as Getty III's mother Gail Harris, you really feel her frustration with Getty Sr. and her desperation finding the ransom money. Mark Wahlberg was good, though I felt like anyone could have played his character. A grade material FROM Marky Mark definitely, just not A grade material FOR him, he didn't really fit. I also liked the actor who played Getty III. One actor who stands out is Romain Duris who portrays one of Getty III's kidnappers. He's a really good character who keeps your interest.Overall, All the Money in the World really pulled through, great directing, pacing, and especially acting from everyone.

137,Scarefish,"""Real people"" should never be this lifeless.",1,7 January 2018,"This film commits the worst sin a film can commit: It is dreadfully boring. It feels ultimately pointless and dwindles on mediocrity at all times, making this an even worse Ridley Scott film than Alien: Covenant, as that film was at least hilariously bad at times. This one nearly put me and my buddy to sleep.At 2 hours and 12 minutes, this film spends much time meandering and padding out its running time with repetitive low-energy diversions and failure is too often consequence-free. The protagonists feel ineffectual and the baddies feel incompetent and nonthreatening as a result, and the vast majority of the film is people talking back and forth with awkward lengthy pauses in their dialogue. This story isn't all that interesting enough to justify the length, and feels like a formality of Ridley Scott at this point. If you give me a taste of suspense and then show me that this happened over the course of months I will believe you. You don't have to present it in real time.The film's portrayal of the Getty family ""as only obsessed with wealth,"" as Ariadne Getty put it upon seeing the film, is not necessarily based on fact. Sure, J. Paul Getty does state his love for his bloodline throughout the film, but it is heavily weighed against with his cold attitude to the situation and an incredibly cheesy ""gotcha"" moment where Getty appears to be negotiating the ransom only for it to be revealed he was simply negotiating the price on a piece of artwork. It's as basic as these ironic Hollywood anti-Capitalism stories go, where the lack of humanity is cartoonishly exaggerated. I probably would have come up with something like this back when I was an angsty teenager who knew everything about the world.J.'s portrayal isn't the only problem though. Practically every character comes off as shallow and one-dimensional, especially the kidnapping victim, John Paul Getty III, who as a teenager is immediately portrayed as a needlessly ungrateful git towards his mother, and thus I didn't feel attached to him as a character, which is a shame since it's based on a real person. Fletcher Chase comes off as terribly incompetent right out of the gate as the movie doesn't spend much of its excessive time portraying his detective work on screen and simply shows one brief interaction which leads him confidently to a wrong conclusion based on no solid evidence.I wanted more humanity and more depth to the characters. There were interesting ideas brought up, such as the issue of paying a ransom encouraging further kidnappings, which is unfortunately just a one-time throwaway line despite being a rational concern.If you are curious about this event, do yourself a favor and read up on it instead of watching this drawn out lazy Oscar bait. Ridley Scott is so hit-or-miss nowadays that I wonder if even the original Alien film was only accidentally a masterpiece, much like M. Night Shyamalan with The Sixth Sense, Joel Schumacher with Falling Down and Neill Blomkamp with District 9.",All the Money in the World
138,Chance_Boudreaux19,Nonsencial ending,7,11 January 2018,"I really enjoyed this movie up until the end, it was a very well done drama and I couldn't notice that Plummer replaced Spacey, well done to Ridley Scott for making it look so seamless. However the movie disappointed me towards the end because it was very Hollywoodized. It started losing me after the ransom was paid and the boy run off, I fully expected a massive shootout or Mark Wahlberg having to fight a few guys to get to Paul. Thankfully that didn't happen but it was still an unnecessary delay, I think it would have been more effective if the boy stayed where he was and reunited with his mother there or if they found him running on the road. But the bit I truly hated comes after that, first off J.P. Getty dies at the same time the boy gets rescued and then his daughter-in-law and his grandson inherit the estate and can be seen selling most of the art. As I was watching that I kept thinking no way this is how it happened and I was right, Getty Sr didn't die until a few years later and what happened to Michelle Williams' character and her son is much more tragic and to be told would require a whole another movie. Now I don't expect everything to be accurate but why would his daughter-in-law inherit the estate instead of any of his numerous actual children or grandchildren? Why couldn't it end in a way where Getty lives and has a conversation with the main characters and still admits that the ransom was not worth paying in his mind driving point the home that money will always be everything to him or something along those lines? Now that would have been more effective and would have seemed more realistic instead of the happy, everything is great, unrealistic, almost Disney-like ending that we got.",All the Money in the World
139,CinePendejo,The best Kevin Spacey Oscar vehicle that almost was.,6,27 December 2017,"I'm tired of this statement more than anybody, but ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD feels like the definitive movie for the Trump era. Taking place during the Getty Hostage situation during the early seventies, it examines the frantic, greedy, and outright despairing nature of humanity under the shroud of wealth and power. Thankfully not as on-the-nose but sadly not all that complex, ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD still puts you at the edge of your seat.In summary, John Paul Getty is this big oil tycoon who is declared the richest man in the world. But now he's faced with the dilemma when his grandson gets kidnapped by mobsters during an Italian vacation and is asked to deliver 17 million dollars in ransom. Being the sly, negotiating bastard persona of all rich people, Getty refuses at first, since he would rather invest in paintings and statues rather than his own family. It's mainly centered around Michelle Williams character as the kid's mother, constantly harassing his father-in-law to grow a fucking heart already as well as getting harassed by the perpetrators.For those who don't get it, its a movie about how money makes us more grimy and hopeless than the actual hostage. A movie where the wealthy and the greedy constantly pursue money yet don't know where to pursue it. From Getty's oil business to the counterfeit purse factories to child trafficking to simple drug dealing, everyone is guilty of money signs on their eyes. Even with all the riches he could hope for, Getty would rather spend money on inanimate pieces of art rather than his own family, claiming that they at least ""hold value and stay the same over the years"".Dire as it may be, I would've like to see the film dig deeper. Let's face it, if you're not constantly aware that a rich bastard is a bastard at this point, this would all sound like revelations. However, a more nuanced or even more darkly comedic screenplay would really bite, whereas this only slightly bruises. It presents a hard case about how greed makes scum of us all, but I'd be lying if I didn't wish it became more of what it wants to be. It mostly concludes that modesty trumps sadism, with one scene highlighting the only humble character preferring a few crackers when presented a hefty steak. Hint, hint.The message isn't all that hard to get, but the way its presented is perfectly aligned with it. Ridley shoots every frame in a gloriously gray haze, almost squeezing out the glam and style of wealth. Scott also strips all sense of hope from the main hostage storyline, constantly jerking me around with every sigh of relief followed by another trap. Say what you will about Ridley Scott at this point, he's a freaking wizard.The acting is sort of mixed but there's no denying that Christopher Plummer is fantastic. Immediately replacing prosthetic nightmare Kevin Spacey after he pulled a Michael Jackson (sorry...) in the press, it's like he's born in this role from the start. Surprisingly lack of reshoot editing and pacing woes - AHEM!! - His scenes add a hefty amount of gravitas without him even trying. He snarks, scowls, and sometimes courteously gestures throughout the movie to instantly elevate his scummy, scummy character. Even in scenes where he isn't involved, you could still feel the shroud of his influence within the story. Adding that with Michelle Williams stern yet hopeless performance, and you almost get a recipe for a powerhouse.However, we also get Mark Wahlberg's puppy voice donning the gruff anti-hero detective and I get taken out of the experience. Though I commend Ridley to have Michelle sock his face with a telephone. Bless.Anyway, it's still two out of three for me, to which I conclude with ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD. Not the best deconstruction of greed, but certainly one of the most exhilarating.cinependejo.wordpress.com",All the Money in the World

It went from different time settings backwards and forwards so we didn't know when it was to different locations back and forth, with in a scene Plummer looking just as OLD twenty five years before when it was set in the 1970's. Shoved some trendy dark glasses on him to make him look younger.Even throwing in weird trippy colouration I though there was something wrong with the TV, dulling down certain colours so much so Wallenbergers face looked gaunt, old & dishevelled up like a cross between an alien out of Roddy pipers 'They Live' and someone out of Bizarro World in the Superman comics.The biggest INSULT to our intelligence, not just the staged escape of the kid with the fire in the farmyard field & escape to a police station only to be handed over back to the Mafia, which I knew never happened even before checking out that it never did.
The biggest insult to the intelligence was the statue thing that old man Plummer was supposed to have given the kid when he was much younger, valued by Plummer as 1.1 million bucks or such figure.
Then the mother in it scraping around the place desperately for money, flying over to see old man Getty for Millions, like she wouldn't have remembered that every day of her life since it was given the kid!!.
THEN only when the instance after she is watching a news snipped of the kidnapping on TV, directly after that the broadcast just so happened to talk about some statue.
The lights came on in her head, OH YES we need millions and we have that statue valued years ago at $1.1 million. End of movie at that point, turned over channel.An utter utter insult to our intelligence. how anyone could watch anymore after that point, those with a subservient mentality may well have. Those who will put up with any old garbage put out there, even by an 'acclaimed' director, claptrap, Ridley Scott proved once and for all he is a rubbish Director.
Given the same story line & actors and film set I bet any other director of the day could have made just as good a movie as the original 1979 Alien movie if not better. What a con artist.

143,littleging12,The Biggest Scrooge in the World,8,13 January 2018,"All the Money in the World will probably be most remembered for the behind the scenes scandal involving Kevin Spacey and the subsequent reshoots with Spacey's replacement Christopher Plummer. Away from all the behind the scenes drama, the movie turned out surprisingly well. It was well acted, philosophical, darkly funny, and always interesting.Director Ridley Scott was burdened with strenuous reshoots before when Oliver Reed died unexpectedly during the shoot of Gladiator. He flawlessly weaves together all the new scenes with Christopher Plummer and keeps his movie afloat when it could have easily sunk. The scandal may have just ended up improving the film because Christopher Plummer was easily the best part. His character was the most interesting, his performance was the best, and he was given the best lines. I'm sure Kevin Spacey would have been solid in the role but might have been a little too distracting with that weird old man makeup. All the Money in the World doesn't particularly impress with its been-there-done-that kidnapping ransom plot, but it still explores the genre with interesting new angles. The film stands out with its aforementioned performance from Christopher Plummer, philosophical dialogue regarding wealth, family, and frugality, and its ability to find humor in dark places. It's amusing to see a man so incredibly rich yet so incredibly frugal that I couldn't help but chuckle at the real life scrooge -- because he is me in 60 years, with red hair and less money. *Spoilers begin here*
All the Money in the World was based on a true story and there were some instances in the film where it felt like Ridley Scott took poetic license for dramatic effect. Certain scenes seemed too implausible to have really happened, for instance, the ending town sequence with Michele Williams' and Mark Wahlberg's characters desperately trying to claim the son before the kidnappers retook him. That whole sequence felt forced and unnecessary. To add insult to injury the movie as a whole, most notably the town sequence, lacked tension, because it was hard to care for the kidnapped boy when he isn't developed terribly well and carries the appearance of a scummy hippie.All the Money in the World may not have worked exceptionally as a thriller nor did it get me to care about the imprisoned child, but it delivered unexpected delight with its captivating performances, insights on wealthy family dynamics, and twisted, petty sense of humor.",All the Money in the World

It's a nearly perfect thriller factually based saving totally gratuitous scenes of the security man advising Getty's wife, poorly played by Mark Wahlberg as if he were the film's main star, scenes that bog the film down in talky, contrived plot padding. He is an irritating wrong note in an otherwise superb movie that I highly recommend.

Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer) was the richest man in the world when his grandson (Charlie Plummer) was kidnapped in 1973. He refused to pay a dime of the $17 million dollar, saying he couldn't afford it and it would set a bad precedent. The boy's mother (Michelle Williams) is left with only the aid of the Italian police and a former CIA operative who works for Getty (Mark Wahlberg) to help recover her son. The film unfolds in a tense drama that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. Michelle Williams is fantastic as a desperate mother willing to do anything to save her child, but having to fight Getty just as much as the kidnappers. Wahlberg is also surprisingly good as the former CIA man that is really a negotiator, not a super spy. The real star is Christopher Plummer's Getty. He is outstanding as an old frail man who built an empire through ruthless negotiations and frugality and refuses to deviate from that even to save his own grandson. His misguided priorities are perfectly displayed by him claiming to not be able to afford the ransom and then spending millions on a new painting. Plummer's performance is all the more impressive considering he stepped in at the last minute and shot all of his scenes in just 8 days.Ridley Scott blends the experiences of the hostage Paul Getty with the worry of his mother and the indifference of his grandfather beautifully.

Dramatic scenes like the discovery of the boy's "" heirloom"" were telegraphed so badly by a script that felt like Ridley Scott had better things to do.

153,kasserine,Outstanding Performances,7,29 December 2017,"All the Money in the World, a film about the kidnapping of J.P. Getty's grandson, works well through its standout performances most notably Christopher Plummer's. The director, Ridley Scott, knows how to make a film. So, I knew going in that, at the very least, it was going to be competently made. I haven't liked everything he's done, but I know that it is unlikely to be a waste of time.Scott delivers. The atmosphere of seventies Italy is well captured. I never doubt that this is in fact the time and place of the kidnapping and the world they inhabit. Again, this is why, for better or worse, Ridley Scott is such a good director, I believe what I'm seeing on the big screen.One criticism I have is that the film is slow in the beginning. Understandably, we have to get a background of J.P. Getty and how he came to be and understand the context of what transpires later. However, it does seem to skip around some, going back in time and then to the present day. This made it a little harder for me to engage with the subject matter.What makes up for this is the compelling interactions between Plummer's Getty and Michelle William's as the former daughter in law, Gail Harris. There are some nice scenes between the two where Getty explains how unable he is to provide the ransom and William's reacts incredulously. Another nice scene, very early in the film, is a visit to his hotel room where Getty has laundry hanging all over his palatial room and he explains matter of factly that the hotel charges too much for laundry service.This was my main interest in All the Money in the World. J.P. Getty. Plummer was so good and his interactions with other members of his family were so interesting and odd that I would have preferred the focus of the film on him and his life.The kidnapping, for me, almost seems a side story. Strangely, I found myself not caring too much about what was going on. Not good considering that is, essentially, what the story is about. I would point out that Romain Duris who played one of the main kidnappers, Cinquanta, also delivers an excellent performance. Duris is able to develop a sympathetic character even though he is one of the main culprits in the kidnapping, although he does redeem himself in the end.So, there is a lot to enjoy in this period film. The 70s atmosphere of Italy, the story of a kidnapping of a famous industrialist's grandson, but the reason to see it is the striking performances of Christopher Plummer and Michelle Williams.",All the Money in the World

But it is just ok.In the first 120 seconds, there is black & white imagery of a beautiful night-life city, people eating outside, cars and scooters jamming together for the city's ritual late-evening social life, the prostitutes with roman ruins on the background. Yes, this is Rome in the mid-Seventies. Great. Just Great.But then, after the 120 seconds, this beautiful retro vintage display is never shown again. What follows is quite conventional movie-making and story-telling.And the story in the movie takes quite some liberties to make it more appealing to viewing audiences. I guess real-life is boring. Yeah, the night-time involvement by the mother, walking in the alleys of the countryside town, knocking on doors and asking if they have seen this teenager, well, that was just pure fantasy. And when the boy reunites with the mother, that was total eye-swelling tear-producing drama.Even the location where the kid was kidnapped was not accurately portrayed. It looked more like Porta Maggiore, when in reality it was Piazza Farnese.Despite all these and many more misgivings, the decor, clothing, style, objects, indoor architecture, was all accurately displayed. Even the posters on the wall next to the phone booth were timed to the time: ""Solidarieta' con il popolo Cileno di Allende"" (Chile just had a political coup by general Pinochet).A positive note: the Italian spoken language was indeed Italian, with (almost) correctly-applied accents, to show they were from the South (English subtitles appeared). This gives more authenticity. On a side note, I think the kidnappers where shown to be a bit too ""wild"" or ""rough"". You know, unshaven faces, rough edges, crumpled clothing. On a final note, it seems to me that American film-making is heavily focused on actors performance on playing a role. And that is what most critics comment on, when reviews are broadcast-ed or printed on American media. On contrast, European film-making is more slanted on the overall social condition or message and less on the individual actor's performance. This film was definitely more slanted on the American model, although some weak references on the social environment of the kidnappers came subtly through.So go and see the film and then, next time you tour Italy, go to Canale Monterano on the northwest of Rome, and visit the XVII century ruin and ghost town, that was used as filming location.",All the Money in the World
156,GoldenBlunderbuss,A miracle it was made at all,6,1 August 2018,"When 16-year-old John Getty III is kidnapped, his devoted mother attempts to get the ransom money from his billionaire grandfather - but he refuses to offer a dime.In 1973, oil tycoon John Paul Getty's 16-year-old grandson is kidnapped in Rome by a group of masked men and held to ransom for $17m. Throughout the film, reference is made to Getty's intense frugality; he washed his own underwear in a 5* hotel bathroom to save the $10 laundry service fee, he installed pay phone in his mansion for guests to use, he negotiated his own grandsons ransom to make it tax-deductible. He once quipped to reporters during the crisis that he refused to honour the initial demand (his equivalent to sofa change) since it would encourage the kidnap of his other grandchildren. It sounds ridiculous, but it really happened.The film plods along at a steady pace but is only interesting when Getty Sr is the focus of attention. If the role remained Spacey's, you'd always suspect he was up to something - that's just the type of character Spacey has become known for since the likes of Se7en, Usual Suspects and House of Cards - but Christopher Plummer trusted demeanour means his selfish intentions come as a constant surprises. Michelle Williams is phenomenal as a tested mother at her wits end, fighting against the reluctance and condescending indifference of most of the men in the story - the irony that her pay was a tiny fraction of Wahlberg's fee should not be lost.The only real problem is the ending - it's a mess of tired clichés, an unnecessarily tacked-on chase scene and a final 'twist' that obviously didn't happen in real life. It smacks of a last-ditch attempt to add quick-paced action where it simply doesn't fit.This film will be remembered for the miracle of its release - the fact it got finished at all following the career-ending allegations against Kevin Spacey and subsequent reshoots with Plummer just four weeks before its premier is a true testament to modern filmmaking and Sir Ridley's resolve in the face of immense adversity. It's hard to believe that Getty himself would've have been so open to the effort and expense.Best Quote: ""It's been reported that you're the first man in history with a fortune in excess of a billion dollars.""

164,HeroOfTomorrow,"What is it, and who is it for?!",3,7 February 2021,"As my partner and I attempted to watch this sterile mess of a film, the urge to fast-forward pressed heavier and heavier on the both of us. The question we kept asking ourselves, is what is this movie supposed to evoke?1. The characters
Generally, it helps to have characters that have a personality when you ask your audience to invest in them. In this film, you're not given any time to bond with any of them. The kid doesn't seem very bothered by being kidnapped, the kidnappers don't seem very bothered by being kidnappers, the mom doesn't seem very bothered having her son kidnapped, and the grandfather's vacillates between caring and not caring on a dime. Who are we supposed to connect with? Ridley Scott needs cool visuals to contrast his terrible character direction. This movie doesn't have any cool visuals.2. Plot nonsense
This movie suffers from the most absurd plot choices. I don't even care if any of this actually happens in the ""true story""; it doesn't work on film. From the police somehow mistaking the body of a 33-year-old male with the body of a 17-year-old boy, to Michelle Williams inexplicably being invited along to a MILITARY RAID, to Paul setting up a plot point with some matches which goes nowhere, the events in this movie are completely inexplicable.3. No stakes
A kid you don't know or care about surrounded by people who don't care is kidnapped. This sure isn't Man on Fire.We actually did end up fast-forwarding. 40 minutes later, we missed nothing. I recommend you fast-forward the entire movie and do something else.",All the Money in the World

In a smaller role, Timothy Hutton also delivers his performance with balance and skill.The rest of the cast is competent, but honestly not up to par with Plummer, Scott & Hutton and this is a part of why the film is extremely good instead of great at the end of the day.

The fact that this is actually a true story made it all the more real. The coldness of the grandfather to his grandson even after knowing how much cruelty he had suffered sent a shiver though my spine. it is only much after i was done watching the film that I could think rationally enough to appreciate the out of the park performance of Christopher Plummer.

170,michael-young-585,Even Plummer can't make up for a so-so script,6,27 August 2018,"By now, even casual movie buffs are aware of the messy politics surrounding this movie. Kevin Spacey was the original actor designated to play J. Paul Getty. And, in fact, they were less than a month from movie release date when it was alleged that Spacey was guilty of sexually assaulting multiple younger men. The production team quickly decided to fire the man and reshoot all of his scenes. They turned to Christopher Plummer, a seasoned actor, who, in two weeks memorized his lines and reshot every scene that Spacey had played. For two weeks they brought back Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams to act with him in their shared scenes, over a hectic Thanksgiving holiday. (The discrepancy in emergency pay between Wahlberg and Williams generated yet another scandal that clearly shows how gender differences are still alive and well in Hollywood.)Most in the industry believe that Plummer saved the movie from a public relations disaster. And that, plus the fact that he did a fabulous job even though he was just 'filling in' yielded him an Oscar acting nomination. Even if one didn't know that he had only a couple of weeks to master a very difficult role, most viewers would agree that he managed a terrific performance, capturing whatever subtleties a man as obsessed with money as Getty might actually muster.I don't know how to judge the veracity of the portrayal of Getty, at the time, the world's richest man. But Plummer successfully creates a man who, though obviously smart enough to amass, and to keep, a huge fortune, still seems morally and emotionally bankrupt and cold. I guess we expect men like this to demonstrate eccentricities, but is it really possible that they are also so remarkably empty inside? Plummer delivers that kind of character and does it well.Why he was nominated for Supporting Actor, instead of Leading Actor, is somewhat of a mystery to me. It is true that Michelle Williams, as J. Paul senior's ex-daughter-in-law and mother of at least some of his grandchildren, has the most screen time and the maximum emotional exposure. But the movie isn't just about her efforts to get the richest man in the world to part with just a little bit of his money in order to save his own grandson. It is also about the reasoning of that man and his emptiness that guides his decision-making. Plummer deserved a nomination in one or the other category for his performance.In researching Plummer's history, I realized I don't really know much about him. His nomination in this movie is just his third Oscar nomination, even though he is approaching 90 years of age. he was nominated in the supporting actor category for the 2009 movie The Last Station, and then, a year later won the Oscar for supporting actor in a movie called Beginners. He is known for earlier performances in something called the Insider and then played a doctor in A Beautiful Mind. Aside for A Beautiful Mind, I haven't seen any of these movies, and I guess I find that surprising, given that it seems we all know his name.Perhaps, unsurprisingly, I'm more familiar with Michelle Williams movies. Although not nominated for her performance here (and I don't think this is her best performance, although she is the central character), she has received four previous Oscar nominations, starting with her breakout performance as the wife in Brokeback Mountain. Then she was nominated for leading actress in Blue Valentine and My Week with Marilyn (as Monroe herself). Finally, she had a terrific supporting role in Manchester By the Sea last year. I've seen all of these movies and agree she brings talent to them. Her performance here is satisfactory, but not compelling. And why does she seem to have to close her eyes whenever there is an important set of lines to deliver - maybe she can only summon up emotion when she isn't looking at her coactors?The third most important character in All the Money in the World, is Mark Wahlberg who plays Getty's head of security. Wahlberg had an early intriguing role in Boogie Nights but gained fame, and was nominated for supporting actor for his performance in The Departed. Although he delivers a credible performance here, the role is really kind of milquetoast - there is nothing that stands out for me except for maybe his final dialog with Getty which seems to come out of nowhere and makes no sense.So we have three very good actors, only one of which comes across in a convincing manner. Part of that failure might just be the fault of the director, Ridley Scott. Scott has an outstanding collection of movies under his belt including the Martian, Thelma and Louise, the original Blade Runner, Gladiator, and Black Hawk Down. (He received Oscar nominations for directing all of those except Blade Runner.). This is an impressive list of movies that just represent the cream of his filmography which includes dozens more movies and television episodes - he is a very busy man. And that might be the problem with this movie - maybe he has spread himself too thin to effectively direct. In 2017 he also released the latest installment in his highly successful Alien movie series. Perhaps by putting so much of himself into that movie, where he has a long and important history, he didn't have sufficient creative resources to make All the Money as good as it might have been, coaxing better performances out of Williams and maybe even Wahlberg. It didn't help that he had to reshoot critical scenes because of the Spacey exit.But a director and actors can only do so much with the material they are given. And I think the biggest problem with this movie was the script. Based on a book by John Pearson, David Scarpa wrote the screenplay for this movie. But I can't say I know much about the man. He also wrote the scripts for Cleopatra, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and The Last Castle. I've never seen the last movie, and the first two were not notable for their lines. He has never received an Oscar nomination. (According to his IMDB entry, he has never received any awards of any kind.). I'm at a loss as to why a director with as much going as Ridley Scott, would choose to work with the script from an unknown.Analyzing the pedigrees of many of the rest of the crew on this movie, there are a couple of movies that seem to form a core for this team - they are all Ridley Scott movies and include the Martian, The Gladiator, and Prometheus. So, if you like how those movies feel and look, you will likely appreciate this one too. Still, I think you will have a tough problem getting around the script. Aside from Plummer's performance, this is only a so-so movie.",All the Money in the World
171,goshamorrell,"Christopher Plummer Dominates ""All the Money in the World""",10,27 May 2021,"Story, everyone loves a great kidnapping story right. So all the money in the world is the movie for you then. All the money in the world was nominated for Best performance by an actor in a supporting role (Christopher Plummer). Something you should know about this story is that family is very important and should be the number one thing in your life. This is a type of movie where you will keep going, will the boy survive, will he get beat for what he did, how's the mom taking this?, is the grandpa doing anything to help pay the ransom money?.In 1973, kidnappers demanded $17 million from billionaire J. Paul Getty in exchange for his grandson's release. Getty refuses to pay the perpetrators a single penny despite the desperate pleas from his former daughter-in-law Gail and adviser Fletcher Chase. With nowhere else to turn, Gail and Fletcher soon become unlikely allies in a race against time to save the teen's life. All the money in the world takes place in Rome in 1973. The main characters of this film are Gail Harris, J. Paul Getty, Fletcher Chase, Cinquanta, Oswald Hinge, and John Paul Getty III. This film is about The story of the kidnapping of 16-year-old John Paul Getty III and the desperate attempt by his devoted mother to convince his billionaire grandfather Jean Paul Getty to pay the ransom.The cast for All the money in the world was well casted with Michelle Williams as the lead actress. She plays Gail Harris and acts the part so well of the mother of John Paul Getty III (The kidnapped grandson). The scenes where she gets emotional when she talks to the kidnappers, it seems like she is actually acting not acting to act. Any movie that Michelle is in, I'll watch, no matter the subject or genre. She does an oscar nomination performance. Christopher plummer.. Has never played a part and didn't add or embrace the character. Plummer has always nailed an ouverture des yeux performance as John Paul Getty. In the beginning of the film with a flashback to when His grandson was young, Getty gives his grandson a 2.5 million dollar statue because he's family. But won't pay the ransom money for him. Everytime I watch Chrisopher Plummer in All the Money in the World I get goosebumps, and feel that he's really playing the character by using his elegant vocalability to show emotion and feeling with the characters thoughts. Then very lastly Mark Wahlberg nailed his part as Fletcher Chace. Chase is John Paul Getty's security guard, and at the end betrays him because he knows money is the only thing that Getty loves or cares about. Mark throughout the entire film is determined to bring home John Paul Getty III, even if his grandfather isn't.What I Loved about the film was the storyline, the acting, the tone of the film, and the director of the film was Ridley Scott. This is a smart, Taut and Stylish Thriller that anyone will want to see. There was really nothing I didn't like. It was so well done, I didn't have anything to dislike about it.The lessons I learned were morals on the meaning of money vs family, people are cheap like Voracious acquirers of wealth like him are really cheap old bastards when you get down to it. To hear Plummer's Getty talk about tax deductions, write-off limits, interest, and the simple notion of wanting more, you grow to despise this man and it's brilliant for the film's suspense. And the Ted Dibiase Rule which is Everyone has a price. The grandson did. Getty did. Gail did. Even the kidnappers did. No one can escape their limit. Whether you can admit it or not, circumstances like All the Money in the World, make DiBiase's catchphrase irrefutably true. Money stands for something, more or less. The reveal of the importance of that something and its price is the most telling trait of all. Others will learn money will change loyalty, and where you put your trust in. Also people always have a price. .The group of people that would like this is 17 years old and up. I would recommend it to JR's in high school and older because it's a really dark film and it's kinda hard to watch and it's intense. The rating of All the Money in the World is R for Language, Some violence, Disturbing images, and brief Drug content. This film is a must see for the teenagers in this generation and the next. It's a must see to show them what money can do, or ruin someone's life.I give this film 5 out of 5 stars.Chrisopher Plummer Dominates ""All the Money in the World"", All the Money in the World"" is a story of towering greed and the absence of mercy, and an ideal 21st century morality tale. It's about money and families and the ties that bind and cut, although because it was directed by Ridley Scott there isn't a jot of sentimentalism gumming the works. In July 1973, John Paul Getty III (known as Paul), the elder Getty's 16-year-old grandson, was snatched off a street in Rome. His kidnappers demanded $17 million in ransom, telling Paul's mother, ""Get it from London."" It was a reference to Getty Sr., who in turn responded, ""If I pay one penny now, I'll have 14 kidnapped grandchildren,"" a kiss-off heard around the world. Mr. Scott sets the scene quickly with a somewhat phantasmagoric meander through Rome's crowded streets.""All the Money in the World"" revs up beautifully, first as a thriller.

176,narine_tevosyan,Review,10,5 April 2019,"This film left a deep impression on me, because the story that we see is based on actual events. A lot of things had been changed in this movie, nevertheless it is a good movie for watching and the viewer after watching it wants to know what happened in real life. I personally after watching searched about the real story.
""All the Money in the World"" demonstrate J. Paul Getty's refusal to cooperate with the extortion demands of a group of kidnappers from the organized crime Mafia group, who abducted his grandson John Paul Getty III in 1973. It demonstrates different characteristics of people, how they can differ and how can some unknown people be more careful and close than some relatives. Ot was incomprehensible for me that grandfather didn't give money fr his grandson's freedom. Ok, it can be a little bit understandable at first why he didn't give them that money, because maybe he thought that the police will find them or that they will leave him after his refusal. However, the part, when the kidnappers cut off the boy's ear and sent it their family, it was shocking for me that his grandfather again didn't do anything.
Another character about whom i want to talk is one of the kidnappers, who cared about this guy more than his grandfather. At first he helped him to escape from this place, however he couldn't do that. Then he talked with his mother and the policemen and told them about their location. In the end he helped them to take their son. So, despite the risk that he can be killed by his colleagues, he did all these actions.
Overall, it is great movie, which makes the viewer to think about his interrelation with his family members. I think that everyone after watching i understands the importance of his/her family bond.",All the Money in the World

He is as cruel as it gets with the top of it being the ear scene, followed by a scene that quickly moves from ""OK I'll pay"" to ""this is a nice way for me to evade taxes"". So there is the question, do money poison us in the depths of our soul? Is love a twisted meaning in the minds of people like Getty Sr.?
Mark Wahlberg is always getting himself in noteworthy films and his role here is pretty critical as he evolves throughout the film quite nicely, affecting the story in different places.
A not so bright spot is the script itself. It feels like it is dragging on and on here and there. The mother's intensity is transmitted to the audience like a virus and Getty Sr. surely leaves a bitter taste whenever he is on screen, but that is not enough.",All the Money in the World

181,catimeup,Can't afford to save your favourite grandson...,3,12 August 2018,"Let me get this out of the way first, the story does get in the way of me enjoying the movie. A billionaire who can't afford to pay for his favorite grandson's ransom, makes sense when considering they could go after the other dozen or so grandkids he has. In that respect it makes sense. The first amount he agrees to actually pay ends up being the amount that is tax deductible...sounds like Shylock asking for his pound of flesh. Later paying the 4 or so million after being threatened by his liaison/security man. I admit Williams did a solid performance as the mother, Plummer plays a convincing Scrooge type character, Mark Wahlberg perhaps is a bit bland or out of place enough to not have a clue how to portray the role. The later is understandable considering his character felt out of place in relation to the movie, so I don't blame him for his lack of any scene chemistry. The kidnappers started out fine, take the kid to secure location, don't give him any details of where he is. So far nothing wrong. Soon enough the kidnappers are lowering their price after months and everything seems to be poorly managed. For 17 million I would expect better organizational and planning skills, combined with a better watchful eye on the bait who seems capable of pulling a MacGyver. In the credits they mention the plot and sequence of events was altered to better suit the movie. It seemed all over the place. There remained elements that could have been added and quite a few that could have been easily left out of the script. While technically not a change of plot, I believe adding Christopher Plummer as old man tight wallet was a better fit for the role than Kevin Spacey. No offence to Spacey's acting, but Plummer in my opinion suits the character more. The change being done initially for the sake of Spacey's allegations was also a great choice for a mainstream movie to say no to actors who have checkered pasts due to allegations. Whether those allegations prove true or not is a whole other can of worms. As much praise as I give the studio for having gotten rid of Spacey, I don't consider carrying that sentiment over toward the movie. In all the movie seemed chaotic, and having only 2 characters carrying the movie alone is not enough. Could have used more emotion, more dramatic effect. I felt as if the kidnapping could have used more elements of terror.

185,richardgeuter,Great acting in a good movie,7,22 March 2018,"What makes ""All the Money in the World"" a suspenseful thriller isn't so much its plot, as it is rather stale, at least in the beginning: The Getty grandson gets kidnapped, the mother worries, the elder Getty refuses to pay the ransom. The story picks up in the second half of the film making it a genuinely exciting thriller, but for much of its running time, the film is content in simply alternating between scenes of family drama and Getty junior interacting with his kidnappers. What is so fascinating about ""Money"" are the characters that inhabit the story: Michelle Williams, naturally, carries many of the dramatic scenes as a desperate but strong mother and the emotional anchor of the film. Her role could easily have been reduced to acting sad and crying all the time, but the script and Williams's performance give the character a welcome amount of strength and intelligence, without ever making her seem cold. Christopher Plummer as Getty senior is given multiple scenes of monologuing and showing off his character in a more relaxed habitat, and Plummer nails all of them. While Gail could, in a less competent movie, have easily been played too emotional, JPG could have come off as too cold and inhuman. But the scenes are written and acted in a way that suggests a more complex character behind Getty that we just don't get to see. You don't become the richest man who ever lived without changing your personality. This aspect of the character is always present in Getty's speeches and the early interactions with his family, and goes a long way in making J. Paul a fascinating role. A biopic of this man's path through life would likely have made an even more compelling movie. There are even some nice interactions between the younger Getty and his kidnappers as well, and Romain Duris, who plays the center character of the gang, manages to be sympathetic and seem almost like a friend to his victim, and then completely bounce back to being threatening. The only major actor who doesn't stand out positively is Mark Wahlberg. He is merely competent, which is a shame because he shares almost all of his scenes with either Williams of Plummer, and if they had gotten and actor who could have held their own against those giants, it might have made the best moments of the film into something far better. His character arc could also have been given a little more attention. Fletcher Chase could even have worked better as the central character of the piece, as he is the closest out of anyone to an audience surrogate. All in all, Ridley Scott's latest is definitely recommended for anyone who wants an entertaining and well-acted crime drama. It most likely won't be regarded as among Scott's best, as I felt sometimes I wanted to see more of the drama than it was showing me (Getty sr.'s backstory, Chase's character arc etc.), but I can't imagine much hate coming toward it.",All the Money in the World
186,chestern-80136,Rich performances and visuals are just enough to keep this film above the metaphorical poverty line.,7,26 January 2018,"I'll be honest: I only really know Ridley Scott because of his work on the Alien franchise. And of those films, I've only actually watched the first one. Before starting this blog, I rarely followed Directors, though that's an error I'm seeking to change.Much like Three Billboards, I've seen this film getting quite a few nominations this awards season. As I'd made it an unofficial New Years' resolution to see more 'real films', I decided to give this one a whirl, despite knowing very little about both the cast, crew and subject matter.By the end, I found myself rather pleased, for quite a few reasons. The film is rather pretty to look at, despite it's oftentimes bleak colour palette. One particular shot, one of Christopher Plummer's last in the film, was especially gorgeous. The dark room was lit by a fire, and it was honestly beautiful.It's worth noting that the pacing may not be for everyone. Based on the trailers, I'd assumed this would be a sleek kidnapping film with a fun soundtrack, potentially with a big shootout at the end featuring Mark Wahlberg's character. Instead, it was a far slower paced, more mature film than I'd anticipated. There was barely a handful of action scenes, though those which were present were handled very well. Despite this, much of the film feels tense, especially thanks to Michelle Williams's performance as Mrs. Getty.The characters are tough to judge as they are based on real people; It's hard to tell what is inaccurate, or what is a poor choice from the director. Regardless, most of what I saw was perfectly enjoyable; Christopher Plummer's Jean Paul Getty was quite wonderful, and I didn't actually notice any of the re-shoots. They blended in seamlessly. I still do wonder what Kevin Spacey's portrayal would have looked like, and part of me hopes that version is released one day, if only to sate my morbid curiosity. As mentioned previously, Michelle Williams was fantastic, regardless of how few emotions the plot allowed her to convey (it typically went from Sobbing, to elated hope, back to sobbing and so on). I must say, I've never been a fan of Mark Wahlberg. I don't think I've seen him in a good movie, though that fault almost certainly remains with me. Still, Marky Mark (sans the funky bunch) gave a fair performance, even if I feel it was somewhat against his 'type'. I see him as more of an 'every-man', rather than a highly trained, ex-government investigator. Lastly, I wish to briefly give credit to Romain Duris. He plays one of the kidnappers, but honestly, I found him to be the most likeable character in the film. All of the Gettys are annoying in their own way, but Romain manages to keep the most human character..Regarding the plot briefly, I'm rather confused. I always struggle with films like these; I don't know how much credit can go to the writers, and how much actually happened. I will give respect to this film, however, for the end slate. It explains that, while the film is based on true events, some of it was dramatised for the film. Many 'based on a true story' films I've seen aren't honest enough to admit they've deviated from the plot somewhat. *Cough, Cough, The Greatest Showman*.The music was something I struggled to pick out at times. Much of it blended into the scene, though many may argue that's a good thing. Personally, however, I prefer iconic soundtracks. I will concede, however, that by the end, there was a particularly powerful song accompanying the Christopher Plummer shot I mentioned earlier. At one point, I also believe I noticed a foreign cover of James Brown's 'Man's World'. It surprised me in the moment, and pulled me from the film while I tried to work out where I recognised it from.Overall, this film was a success for the most-part. At the halfway point, I probably would've given the film a 5/10. Very little had happened that earned my interest, but the second half managed to pull me back in. In total, I'll give the film a 7/10.This doesn't affect my scoring at all, but I feel I should briefly mention it. If you have epilepsy, I would advise you to steer clear. While many films claim to have 'bright, flashing lights', there was a short scene where I began to feel sick watching it, and I don't even have an illness relating to such a thing.",All the Money in the World

The scene where she asks ""Do they want me to cry?"" potrays the real emotion people go through in situations like these.

190,icasilas,The true story of greed and morality and the tale of a brave director.,8,13 May 2018,"Before we delve into the difficult circumstances that surrounded the production of this well-crafted picture - something I personally didn't expect due to all the misfortune the universe threw at it with the recast of Christopher Plummer as John Paul Getty instead of Kevin Spacey- let's talk first about its brilliancy. Believe me, we should not undermine how much work and endeavour had gone into this movie, let's not take away the honour that the visionary octogenarian director Ridley Scott deserves for making this thorough and visually astonishing picture. I have to admit, even though I have always been a massive fan, I could not believe that the man could effectively create such an intricate picture, knowing that he had to give away multiple scenes featuring the laid off actor Kevin spacey let alone make the bald decision of letting him go midway into the movie's production. As always , Ridley Scott tells rather beautifully the story of a billionaire who suffered to make his fortune and fought well to keep it, the story of the then richest man in the world John Paul Getty played by the wonderful Christopher Plummer, a merciless industrialist who left life aside to pursue a never ending accumulation of money .but even though the picture itself focused more on the kidnapping of his grandson and the way his family , and especially his mother portrayed by Michelle Williams , dealt with it , ranging from grief and sorrow to plain desperation , it never forgets its main character: the man that created the whole mess his family was so tragically spiralling inside . The amount of complexity that the character of John Paul Getty was showing throughout his life would be extremely hard to portray for someone of a lower calibre than Christopher Plummer , the highly talented and experienced actor conveyed perfectly the war that was going inside the man during his grandson's kidnaping , the mixed sense of guilt , remorse and his conventional cold sense of dealing with problems made him live a very difficult situation back then : he knows that every moment he waits is threatening the life of his beloved grandson but his nature , one of a hardened and tough industrialist stops him every time from letting his feeling of disparity loose , he knows well that he amassed his fortune and built his empire by cutting all expenses which means that his is stroke in his deepest weak points when his money is put into bargain against his loved ones by the Italian mob . However, the brilliant depiction of his character in this picture shows that there was no way that John Paul Getty would have given away his money to the kidnappers, his convoluted ways would certainly result in his grandson's death! The safe return of John Paul Getty III was the fruit of the tireless efforts of his mother Gail Harris who pushed his rich but obstinate grandfather to see the idiocrasy of his moral principals ,and after the final blow dealt by Fletcher Chace ,portrayed by mark Wahlberg, Gail and Getty's adviser and former CIA operative who confronted the man about his fragility and the vulnerability of his whole ethics' system , causing the man to pay the exact amount of the ransom , which led to the safe return of his grandson who was aided by a very friendly Italian gangster to escape his abduction , but unfortunately led to his lonely and miserable death .
This picture is honestly very underrated, its story was thorough, and its characters were well built and amazingly acted. It may have suffered of the scandal of Kevin Spacey, who disappointed me when I was highly revering him as one of Hollywood's greatest, but it survived , and that is in itself a colossal achievement for which the great Ridley Scott deserves all the praise.",All the Money in the World
191,ManOfKino,The Boring Adventures of Scrooge McDuck,2,30 June 2018,"The grandson of J. P. Getty, history's richest man, was kidnapped in 1973. The kidnappers hoped that the old man would pay up to free him, but he proved to be miserly and uncaring beyond their and his family's beliefs.All the Money in the World is purported to be based on real events, however the extent to which this is true is unclear. It seems that some of the most central characters in the film, such as the sympathetic kidnapper who becomes the grandson's reluctant guardian, and the ex-CIA agent helping Getty's daughter-in-law, never existed as such. However, these things aren't the greatest problems of this film. Rather the problems are that there is almost no suspense, that it fails to maintain a consistent tone from scene to scene (which make the rather numerous attempts at humour fail) and that the central character of J. P. Getty is basically pushed aside, since we never really understand what made him become how he was in terms of personality. We also don't see what happens after the arduous crisis depicted in the film reaches its conclusion.As a whole, All the Money in the World felt very pointless to me. While the direction bears some marks of the once-great director, and there aren't many complaints to be had about the acting, one can't help but wonder what good these are when the core of the work is so empty.",All the Money in the World

199,Biskuitt,Let me put this movie on a different tier,7,25 March 2018,"All the Money in the World (2017), based on an enchanting persona, who showed the world that money can be achieved without any limiter but everything will go in-vain if there's no one to spend money on or in to.Movie felt premium. Christopher Plummer (attended ""J. Paul Getty"" role) did an absolute amazing work. He obviously showed why he's a veteran when it comes to ""acting"".Mark Wahlberg's performance as Fletcher Chase was So-So. He didn't blend with the character nor with the 60's-70's era. Whenever he appeared, it just felt like he's either a 90's punk rock teenage or a 2010's cool dad.Michelle Williams is generally a great actress. I really loved what she did in Blue Valentine (2010), Brokeback Mountain (2005), Manchester By the Sea (2016), Shutter Island (2010), The Greatest Showman (2017) and many more but I really hated the way she acted in this movie. Her acting was completely flat and in some scenes, it felt like someone was making her acting in-front of camera on gun-point. Her facial expressions were; excited when it should sad or in tears, cringy eye and facial movements where it should be helpless facial expression.Kidnappers did awesome job at acting. No complains on that. They were mind-blowing. The kid acted flat but acceptable cause the kidnappers were ... nice to him?! There was no panic or horror in his eyes. He was just there, director told him to scream, he screamed, director told him to throw his limbs here & there, he threw. No emotion whatsoever, he was just waiting to finish his work and get the paycheck. Won't forget to mention the useless intro where he was seen walking like a hillbilly, telling every call girls that he can take care of himself for no reason and then getting kidnapped. It was not an attention grabber at all but a lame example of a failed attempt. Instead they could have showed that the kid came out of a Cinema hall with friends, chatting about how he can get some money out his grandfather by faking his kidnap and then getting kidnapped for real instantly. They could make their audiences confused whether he was actually kidnapped or just faked it (Yes, it became a big news back then when it was published that the kid tried to fake his own kidnap, some simple research will make you learn about it). Completely failed to implement this part but later they tried to tell this part in the movie, in a poor way.Few props and clothes looked poor, few scenes looked bad, bad angle and bad color correction and these are acceptable cause they re-shot a lot of things in a huge rush. This is why JP Getty's character looked out of the thread in some point but it can be forgiven.Lastly I want to add is, about Kevin Spacey. I really don't care about personal life they live(d), whether they banged guys or girls or some weird scandals where it can't be proved whether it was legit or not, I do not free-fall on these stuffs unless it has been proven properly, not just by someone's verbal or written accusation. I just care about acting. Love actors what they are loved for, ACTING. If Kevin's personal life wasn't leaked like that and if his parts stayed in the movie, I will say it would have been an absolute disaster. His prosthetic and 3d makeups were looking really, REALLY bad, unreal and synthetic. Directors and their team picked Christopher Plummer for JP Getty's role at the end accidentally and only he ACED in the whole movie, rest of the people suked ass and you will clearly notice that those were bad selection, from Mark Wahlberg to Michelle Williams to Kidnapped Kid (Including Kevin). I still don't know why Hollywood wastes millions of dollars on some fake prosthetic, CG and VFX when they can pick actual veteran actors who can play the role perfectly, who resembles the most and who will appear much more organic with lot less money. The production house absolutely deserved the loss they faced for picking Kevin Spacey, wasting millions of dollars on him to make him look like JPG (Which he didn't look like at all, funny) instead of picking Christopher in the first place.I give this movie a solid 7. Pretty time spending movie, specially it's a 2h+ film, so it got my attraction. Didn't love it nor dissatisfied but One thumbs up (not two) with a smirk on my face.",All the Money in the World

202,mmmarks,"Good film in Scott's ""personal"" vein; GREAT score",8,28 December 2017,"The story of this film is actually is not as true to the facts as some reviewers would have you believe (e.g., Rex Reed). There's a lot of poetic license. For one thing, Getty himself didn't die until three years later, not (seemingly) on the same night that his grandson was released. (That's a Dickensian touch.) For another, the grandson's final suspenseful flight through the town, pursued by killers, seems to have been a total fiction. He showed up at the gas station where his mother and Chase were waiting. But this way we could think about the way the Italian code of silence influences the culture more generally.In the interest of a ""higher truth,"" and sharp moral contrasts, the scenario is highly effective, while the actors are mostly understated (maybe moreso once reshoots were done after Plummer came on board). And in keeping with the performances, Scott and his cinematographer have made the film to look underlit and coated in grayish and bluish hues. (Does the sunlight ever shine out?) To me this all started to feel like a commentary on the way most of the characters live without love or honor. But it also made me think of those paintings by old masters which Getty was so obsessed to acquire. The take on centuries of grime that have to be removed to be restored: But who could ever restore Getty himself to an honorable portrait? I also want to give a strong commendation to the film's great score by Daniel Pemberton. His concept was inspired: he wrote music ironically suggestive of the Italian opera and choral music traditions, but it never overstates feelings and demonstrates considerable skill. (The opening music is an almost playful pseudo-fugue. The mood is hard to read, which is just right.) Bravo.",All the Money in the World

207,hutchnotes,Christopher Plummer = Brilliant Pinch Hitter,8,11 January 2018,"NOTESI thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and give it a B+. The only critique I have is that the narrative was a bit jumpy, which worked for its benefit, but something felt off in the direction. Having said that, I know that Kevin Spacey had originally filmed the scenes for J. Paul Getty, and was replaced with Christopher Plummer after shooting had wrapped, which may explain the slight awkwardness in the narrative although I wouldn't be able to point anything out concretely. This also simply reinforces the absolute grace of the performance of Plummer as Getty. He portrays a figure we love to hate as someone who has enough quirks and loneliness to make us view him as human.Michelle Williams in her portrayal as Abigail Getty is deserving of acting awards as well as Plummer. Mark Wahlberg was solid, but did not exceed expectations, and Charlie Plummer (apparently no relation to Christopher Plummer), who played young Paul, unfortunately brought the film down half a step with a one dimensional performance.REVIEWRidley Scott's ""All the Money in the World"" tells the story of one of the most famous kidnappings of the 20th century. J. Paul Getty (played by brilliant pinch-hitter Christopher Plummer) is the richest man in the world at the time (and the richest man in the history of the world at the time). His grandson is kidnapped from the off the street in Italy and held for ransom. The key conflict upon which the entire film rests on is Getty's response to the ransom demands - he refuses to pay. Despite his overwhelming wealth and staggering assets, he refuses to bat an eye at the ransom demands of the kidnappers. Young Paul's mother is played by Michelle Williams who gives a stealthy powerhouse performance alongside Fletcher Chase (Mark Wahlberg), Getty's right-hand man and ex-CIA spy.Getty is introduced as a looming figure larger- than- life while Gail and her son Paul are painted as ordinary people sucked into the vacuum that is the Getty Empire. John Paul II, Paul's father, is an alcoholic who resents his father for never spending time with him. He is estranged from his father until he desperately needs a job to support his wife and three young children. They move to Italy where John Paul II is hired as VP of operations of Getty Oil over Europe. Once John Paul II gets his hands on that kind of money and responsibility, he crumples into a strung out drug addict in Marrakech with the likes of Mick Jagger. Chase serves as the expert mediator hired as Getty's top security man and charged with the responsibility of bringing back young Paul ""as inexpensively as possible."" The character of Chase serves as a central figure in viewing the kidnapping from an outsider's perspective, a more objective perspective - his only motivation is to retrieve young Paul.Gail serves as the rock of the story. Upon her shoulders Scott places his moral messages, and uses her character to bring light the absurdity of greed. When she divorces John Paul II, instead of demanding money and a fortune from Getty, she only wants custody of her children, which befuddles Getty, because in his mind everyone wants his money. When the kidnappers demand $17 million for the return of her son, she is two months late on the rent, and thus goes to bat for her son against an empire. Michelle Williams shines in this role. I've never really seen her in much else, or at least it doesn't ring a bell, but I will have to do my research because I was thoroughly taken by her performance. She is perfectly cast as a strong, subtly immovable mother. What I love about this film more than the performances of Plummer and Williams is that Scott has created a film that discusses the evil of greed, critiques capitalism, comments on the importance of family and the deterioration of the priority American civilization places on family, but in the middle of these huge universal themes is Gail. A woman in the 1970s battling goliaths - her ex-husband's abandonment for consumable substances, the Italian press who think she should cry in public, the Italian police who judge her at every turn (how can she possibly think about having a place to cook food in her kitchen while her son is being held hostage), the Getty Empire, and on top of it all still be a mother to two frightened children.See hutchnotes.com for more reviews.",All the Money in the World

It showed me everything I wanted to see and it did it in the most boring, lifeless manner possible. In a situation where the heir to the largest fortune in the entire world lay waiting to be either tortured or killed both me and his his family should have been biting our nails, which I'm sure they were in real life, but in this movie there was no life to be found.

The only solace I found in this movie was the hidden humour in Paul Getty's greed.",All the Money in the World
210,cinema-32,mini review of All The Money In The World,9,10 January 2018,"Mini review of All The Money In The WorldFirst of all Kevin who???? Christopher Plummer a late replacement owns the role of Jean-Paul Getty senior,truly a master class in acting from one of Canada's preeminent actor.
The time is the 70's and those were turbulent days in Italy. A host of kidnappings was taking place, the Italians were not overly fond of rich foreigners living in their midst which explains the slowness of unfolding events when Jean-Paul Junior gets kidnapped. This was probably one of the first big media circus event with paparazzis sticking around like flies on the proverbial dead bird.
The initial ransom demand was 17 million dollars which predictably grandpa Getty, a notorious cheapskate, refused to pay. Plummer plays him with such venomous ferocity, it's difficult to feel any inkling of sympathy for him. Frankly I wanted him dead. A word of caution here. If you already suffer from an irrational hatred of truly loathsome extremely wealthy people (read billionaires) this movie isn't going to help you deal with that hatred. It didn't help me.
Wonderful in the pivotal role of mother Abigail (not a penny of Getty money to her name) is Michelle Williams. She's always been impressive but she truly shines in this one. Equally good in a less showy role is Mark Wahlberg as fixer, homme de confiance and security pro Fletcher Chase.
I was surprised to find Romain Duris, well known French actor, in the role of sympathetic kidnapper and caretaker Cinquante.
The movie directed by Ridley Scott with just the right amount of suspense, intrigue and heart has all the ingredients of a taut thriller, money (lots of it), violence, greed and power. Superbly edited the movie never flags, I didn't want to miss one single moment even though nature was calling. Highly recommended. My grade: A",All the Money in the World

212,mc1966,Quite disappointing,5,13 January 2018,"The story had great potential and the director's fame led to me to the movie theater with great expectations.
In the end, I left quite disappointed. The acting is just so-so, the depth with which the characters are drawn is somewhat shallow but... most of all, the script was amateurish and full of absurd situations. Just a few examples:
Ms. Getty's car being too many times besieged by a crowd of paparazzi, who are routinely and cartoonishly swept aside when the car accelerates, tyres screeching; Red Brigades terrorists looking like complete idiots in the way they interact with Mr. Chase (including leading him to their office-like hideout, without first blindfolding him);the police being unable to make up the difference between the corpse of a 40-year old and quite strong man. and a thin adolescent;the special-ops squad breaking in the kidnapper's hideout, without keeping Ms. Getty and Mr. Chase at a distance;Ms. Getty and Mr. Chase effortlessly commuting from Rome to the UK and back, like in a 007 movie;the scene during which a small mountain village has everyone looking for the newly-released, but again fugitive John Getty (the kidnappers, Ms. Getty with Mr. Chase and the police), but hardly anyone is aware of each other.In the end, a better scripting and acting might have made this movie a memorable one.

Devious in the real world, in movie making terms is totally accepted to do anything to lure people into the movie theaters. Probably their marketing people thought that a detailed slicing of an ear may do it. It made me so angry. No tension, no passion. The only reason to see the film is Michelle Williams. I didn't realized it was her until well into the movie, in fact until she has a scene with Mark Whalberg. She is real and truthful, when they stay with her everything works. Christopher Plummer plays the old mean billionaire to perfection but I must admit I thought of Kevin Spacey throughout. Everything is shot without real thought behind it.

Did you see Scott's version of Robin Hood with Russell Crowe? No, here Scott attempts the conquering of box office grosses by a close up of J Paul Getty's ear as he's been mutilated. What a shame! Ridley Scott had the extraordinary Michelle Williams to play the mother and she is the one that makes it true even if the script doesn't provide her with well structured scenes and gives her Mark Whalberg to bounce of. He seems the hostage at times, delivering his lines without an ounce of real conviction. Charlie Plummer (oddly enough no relation to Christopher Plummer) is lovely and Christopher Plummer appears as a techno distraction but if they thought we were not going to be replacing Plummer for Spacey in our minds, all the time - aware of the performance as well as the technical wonder - they were wrong.

Nobody paid any attention to the horrors not the real ones anyway, just the exterior ones of opulence, meanness and greed. Everything for and because of money, everything. The kidnapping of young J Paul Getty caught the attention of the world then, the plight of his mother is the stuff great drama is made of and here Michelle Williams does wonders with her character. She is totally true, one hundred per cent of the time, but her director doesn't know how to capture it. The film is a rambling, repetitious, undramatic product by Ridley Scott. I didn't detect any real thought behind it. Just craftsmanship and that sometimes is enough, but not this time. I suppose money was also behind this enterprise. Even the stitching of Christopher Plummer in place of Kevin Spacey has a totally commercial connotation. Mark Whalberg? I like him but everyone laughed when he appeared on the screen.

Chris Plummer is uniformly great in all he does, so that was a real plus here. He was positively reptilian! Wow. Perhaps better than Spacey would have been. Re-filming did not look rushed as the story was pretty seamless. Plummer played Getty as a creep, yes, but look at the fantastic art he left the world. Great men are often bad guys in person, but sometimes their legacies at least somewhat make up for it. It did in Getty's case.Did not like Michelle William's portrayal of the daughter-in-law, as she said she was broke but seemed to have great clothes, perfect hair and makeup all the time. and she always acted like an elitist stiff. But, surely that's what the director wanted. Wahlburg was his same guy he is in every movie, but was serviceable. Plummer was the gem here, as always.

223,daniel_haddad,Keeps you engaged... but not much else,6,30 December 2017,"In this dramatic thriller, All the Money in the World creates a story about money, power, greed, and the struggle of what family means... all at the expense of a teenage boy. In this film, the 16 year old grandson of billionaire J. Paul Gatty (Christopher Plummer) is kidnapped in Rome and the Gatty family struggles in an internal family battle of whether to pay the ransom. The story itself keeps the audience engaged while the screen play and acting help keep them on the edge of their seat. One of the most difficult things for a director and writer to do is to keep the audience engaged when the film is based on real events where the outcome is already known. Director Ridley Scott once again delivers on producing scenes where the audience can feel the same emotions the characters are feeling. Scott adds a ""dark-like film"" over the picture to help get you into the time period and context of the storyline. Plummer was brilliant on the screen and played Gatty to the point that you love to hate him. Through his portrayal you begin to get a glimpse into how greed can control a person away from common sense. Similarly, Michelle Williams (Gail Harris) was great on the screen playing the role of a distraught, yet determined mother who not only had to battle her son's kidnappers- but her own family. The one disappointment was in Mark Wahlberg's character, Fletcher Chase. It was not so much as Wahlberg's acting as it was just in his character's presence in the story. Chase seemed to just take up space in most scenes and did not play into the overall story in my opinion. Overall the story does not stick completely true to the original story (what ""inspired by true events"" does?!), but the changes do keep the audience engaged and on the edge of their seats hoping for a positive outcome. Through good story telling and filming you leave the theater after a giant exhale that you did not know you were holding in. It was a good story and positive experience, but as Plummer's character says in the film when asked how much his grandson was worth - What would make me watch the movie again?

The cars, clothes, the appalling intrusion of the paparazzi...Best acted character for me goes to Abigail Harris ( Getty ), closely followed by John Paul Getty the third. The suspense is palpable and even though it plays with the truth, it works. John Paul Getty, the patriach, is a tragic monster. His modus operanti is money and it brings nothing but despair and hate. John Paul Getty the third, poor lad, died even though he seemingly survived . The film shows that so vividly. This boy will never be the same again. His grandad killed him psychologically by making him endure months of emotional torture. For the Gettys money bought them nothing but pain. This is a very accomplished work.

""All the Money in the World"" is one of those movies that you may watch a couple of times, but later forget about it. It is a good story (true, but unbelievably so) about the wealthiest man in the world who's grandson is kidnapped and held for ransom. You can see the character of J. Paul Getty (played by the incredible Christopher Plummer) who refused to pay the ransom for his family member, which would have cost him hardly anything. The film is a thriller, which much tension and concern for the young man who was captive for months. However, the movie drags on at times and the acting seems forced at others. I am a fan of Mark Wahlberg, but he seemed to be playing the same part that he did with ""The Departed"", which was not his best role at all. In the end, what makes this film watchable at least more than once, is that it is factual and unbelievable. If it was fictional, it would have been a snooze fest at best. BUT...considering that Christopher Plummer came in post-production and shot his scenes in a two week period, AND hit it out of the park, is worth the viewing in itself.

(Actually, the guy next to me left half-way through the film so he probably thought it was below average.) I thought the best thing about this movie was Michelle Williams' performance. I really didn't care for anything else. I thought the writing could've used a lot more rewrites. Was it really that necessary to have so much background information?! We already knew Getty was rich--why did we have to watch how he became rich? And his deadbeat son brought absolutely nothing to the table.Then there was the directing. This was probably one of the slowest paced ""thrillers"" I have ever seen. Mr. Scott needs to study films like Andrew Davis' ""The Fugitive"" or John McTiernan's ""The Hunt for Red October."" Those movies MOVED. This movie meandered. It seemed like it took forever to go from the actual kidnapping to the discovery of the identity of the kidnappers. Otherwise, this film needed some light humor to balance out the boredom--something like ""Argo.""Finally, I had a problem with the acting. With the exception of Williams, I really didn't care for any of the other actors. I thought Christopher Plummer was all wrong for his role. This film didn't need a Scrooge-like character. It needed someone more colorful and flamboyant--someone like Kevin Spacey. Or someone like the Alan Arkin character in ""Argo."" I think one of the reasons this film seemed like it dragged on forever was because Christopher Plummer was very boring! He lacked charisma. (Was the real Getty like that?! He seemed more like an accountant than a successful businessman.) I also didn't care much for Charlie Plummer. I didn't think he brought anything to the grandson character except stupidity, such as wandering around late at night in the worst part of Rome and jumping into any Tom, Dick or Harry's car. (You'll know what I mean if you see it.) Then there was the chemistry. I didn't think any of the characters had any chemistry with each other--especially Michelle Williams and her husband, Michelle Williams and her son, Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg.

Rockefeller or Henry Ford, and much of the ""facts"" covered in this film weren't really public knowledge then. Suffice it to say, JPG wasn't a very nice guy.
Now to the movie: Christopher Plummer and Michelle Williams, as well as the ""good guy"" kidnapper were brilliant, but tell us again why a supporting actor in a bad 70s haircut with only one memorable scene was able to almost get away with an extra cool $1.5 mill before being publicly outted and shamed.

Had it just been either instead of being a lukewarm soup of both then i think it coulve been decent, but it doesnt work out well and initially its a huge mess back and forth in time.
The moral of the story is also pretty clear and pretty boring with absolute zero nuances or subtle differences: The rich guy is a petty snob because he refuses to pay the ransom of 17 million $ and the poor guys are the morally surperior. The story hammers this boring predictable point in after just 15 minutes and then it just repeats this moral for another 2 hours.
Plummer does a decent job in his role objectively speaking. But its clear as day that this movie has gotten so much attention because of the Spacey drama and is trying to feed off this fact and I dont like that.

Or not? But about that later...Whatever we think about Scott's current production, we need to acknowledge that he knows what he is doing and there isnt anything about this movie that is bad.The sligtly toned picture has a slight retro feeling, the camera plays perfectly with the lights, the occasional slow-motion shots are impresive...great.Only the music felt a little...off.Like a half-parodied version of WagnerThe acting performances are..good.They arent bad, but they arent nothing extra.The most interesting thing is Plummer as a swallowed millionaire.(replaced Kevin Spacey a month before the premiere)but that is because he has the most brutal lines and he is most clearly defined by the screenwriters.By that we are getting into the movies weakest part-The ScreenwritingAs I said before about the unpredictable and bizzare plot twists and how they come from a complete coincidence.""OK"" I said ""If it actually happened that way it happened and it was that bizzare,that it was worthwhile filming it, even if it seems completely demented"" But after the movie,I realized that the 90% of the movies events happened completely differentely,even one of the greatest points that were completely sucked out of a thumb(like at the end,where the two events happened consequently,while in real life happened a few years prior)So the ""coincendential dementia"" of many plot twists wasnt written by fate, but mainly screenwriters.Which brings down a lot on this movie,so when the screenwriters fictionalized the story,they couldve fictionalized it better.Also the thing that this movie doesent have is ""documentary realism"". For a while we watch a kidnapped grandson, fow a while we watch a rich milionaire, for a while we watch a mother with the adviser, we even get some flashbacks to the old times, but it still isn't clear who is the main character and what the creators wanted to say.Plummer's old man is in a style of Ebenezer Scrooge and with realistic playing from Wahlberg and Williams are somewhat passing. The long sequences of the grandson trying to escape are fairly interesting and entertaining,but-with its own genre it is not related to the rest of the movie,I have a feeling that it just doesent belong there.When in the finale of the movie,the character just radically changes his behavior,he doesent remember his past motivations to be that wayAll The Money In The World will impact you better, the less you rummage ""how it was in real life"".If you wont rummage in it, you can throw the inability of the screenwriters to a volatile and real fate, and say to yourself ""Wow,that was weird because the reality was weird"".

He's made a film which shows the incredible influence which money can have on people and how they act. The controversy around Wahlberg and his payments for re-acting some of the scenes makes watching this movie even more interesting.The three golden globe nominations are completely deserved. Scott is skillful enough to put a lot of events and storylines in just one movie, complete with character development. He also manages to avoid melodrama, which at several moments throughout the film could have easily happened. Michelle Williams is one of the reasons this movie stands out as well. She's acting greatly as desperate mother. Very nice how Scott and Williams play with the cliché that a 'mother has to cry now if she really misses her son' as an Italian paparazzi at some point shouts to her. The most incredible performance is that of Christopher Plummer though, he gives Getty just enough emotion to be human, but not enough to be seen as acting humane. Considering his age and the fact that he almost had no time to prepare for this role make his performance also oscar-worthy.The other important actors in the film, Mark Wahlberg, Charlie Plummer and Romain Duris deliver acceptable performances, but don't stand out. That's especially a shame for Wahlberg, who is one of the most important figures in this film. Sure, this motion picture also has some flaws: the start is a bit messy.

It stars Christopher Plummer as the rich douche as he does an amazing job at quickly erasing all traces of Kevin Spacey's face in the movie. Ridley Scott does an incredible job at this movie, the direction work really brings you into the world of Rome while, the characters not so much. Don't get me wrong, Christopher Plummer does a brilliant job as the scummy rich guy in this movie who refuses to pay anything to free his captured grandson but apart from this granddad, the ex FBI agent and the captured grandson really didn't do it for me, they were not very compelling at the least and I feel if they put more soul into these characters the movie wouldn't feel like such an ache to sit through, which unfortunately it does. The movie takes its sweet sweet time and definitely carries on past when you think it should probably end; the pacing is definitely this movie's biggest fault. For the first part of the movie you are taken into the world but after a while you just want to see some action occur, there is way too many scenes of dialogue about not very compelling themes and ideas, if these dialogue scenes were used to make the main character less cardboard then it would have worked but unfortunately it opts to just have the political commentary hammered down the audience throats.However, those are the negatives. The movie does have its upbeat parts, especially a certain gruesome scene which was very hard to watch and the kidnapper actually ended up having quite a bit of complexity to his character and there's a reason for that. The movie is definitely a commentary on the rich disconnect, the movie loves to really zone in on the political asspect and because of the attention it does make the movie worth sitting through, but I am not sure I'd watch it again. The thrilling aspects, although spare, were pretty suspenseful and I think that's most in part to Ridley's directorial role. 7/10, the movie is worth a watch if it sounds like your thing. Just be ready for a slow working movie which may leave you wanting more, nonetheless, its a pretty solid movie.",All the Money in the World
248,voldersniels,"All the money in the world , but instead a poor movie",5,4 January 2018,"I Was disappointed in this one. This movie had the right ingredients great experience. Good actors, a great story...
While you can't say this movie has bad acting, During the movie you really can't bond with these characters because the story doesn't stick on the characters.
For me Ridley real missed a opportunity with this picture.

249,grandwazoo-99369,Relative.,8,13 May 2020,"I was the same age as J. Paul III so this is interesting to me. Our age was all we shared as I was a kid in US flyover country. I followed it via the NYT at my local library. Michele Williams character and her acting stole the show. Yes it's slow in places but a good flick overall. Scott did a great job as is usual and Wahlburg was pretty good in a role somewhat out of his wheelhouse. I didn't care for the cliched portrayal of by Plummer but he is a good actor that ""came of the bench"" to save the game.Romain Duris was almost as good as Williams.",All the Money in the World

252,FilmLover613,Disappointing.,1,26 December 2017,"Not even all the money in the production budget could seamlessly replace Kevin Spacey with Christopher Plummer. Director Ridley Scott claimed that it only took 4 days to reshoot all of the scenes, and it looks like it. Regardless of the logistical feat, the reshoots feel oddly disconnected, not the least of which being the early scene in Saudi Arabia where the lighting and framing of Plummer makes it look like he was obviously shot on green screen then superimposed over Spacey. It's hard to push that out of mind once the film gets going because the film never really does get going. There's globe hopping and time jumping happening for the first twenty minutes all to set up the Getty family and their zeitgeist. Scott never lingers long enough on any place or person long enough in the first act to get a strong sense of who or where the characters are aside from, ironically, J. P. Getty played by Plummer - the guy it took the least amount of time to film. Marky Mark just plays himself, but Michelle Williams does her best to give Abigail Harris a sense of Transatlantic panache and motherly desperation. To their credit, they don't have very much to work with. The real star of the movie is Italy, complete with fine art, wry witted prostitutes, pasta, and paparazzi. The best parts of the film reminded me of Fellini's La Strada and La Dolce Vita (mostly for hordes of photographers getting displaced in chaos, but they are only brief peripheral glimmers in the mise en scène of a fruitless story about people we mostly don't care about. One thing that isn't understated is the elder Getty's inhumane love of money, but it's in some strange way justified by the end because his assets were tied up in an art collection that eventually aided his family and various charitable organizations after his death. So the whole ""desperate poor, wanton rich, and the middle class suffer"" theme is hardly unequivocal, and really, what would be the point of telling this story without it? I guess there isn't one, and this movie is pointless.",All the Money in the World

257,alan-237-482956,Poor effort of a film,3,26 July 2018,Very disappointing film with mediocre performances from some well know names. The first few minutes set in Rome was shown in black & white ! Why? Did they not have any colour in Rome in 1973? The rest of the film was shown in a peculiar tinted effect which thoroughly spoilled my viewing. I never bothered to persevere to the very end. All the facts of the case are well known and documented - why go to the trouble of making this pathetic piece?,All the Money in the World
258,jordanbeard-17266,"Money, money, money... incredibly boring",5,29 December 2017,"I was excited to see this film but was let down but the sheer boredom it provoked. The film is non-stop ""where's the money?"", ""please give us the money,"" ""money, money."" I guess given the name I should've expected nothing more than 2 hours of people talking about money. Old Man Getty is an overwhelmingly uninteresting character... the most compelling scene was the moment we watch him die. Also weird that they leave out the real ending of the story: that Paul Getty III lived a very sad life after the kidnapping and died young. There were a few fleeting action sequences that distracted me from how little I cared about any of the characters. Odd color choices too- I found the blue color grade distracting. I think the trailer is better than the film, maybe stick with that.",All the Money in the World
