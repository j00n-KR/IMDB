0,Leofwine_draca,"Good, apart from the flaws",6,10 May 2018,"BRIMSTONE is a watchable and well-directed western drama from the Netherlands. It has some pretty big flaws that are impossible to ignore, but a kind of surreal, slow-burning plot with biblical touches which get in your head. One thing I didn't like was the non-linear structure; this is told in four chapters but they don't take place chronologically, making it confusing at times. A logical progression, from beginning to end, would have been much better. At two and a half hours the film is also way too long and feeling padded at times, so some judicious cutting would have helped a treat. What this does feature is some fine acting, particularly from the great Guy Pearce who really relishes the chance to play a powerful and imposing villain. I'm less keen on Dakota Fanning, although the actress playing her younger self is very good and could go far. Kit Harrington features prominently on the cover but turns out to have a very small role considering. The film is starkly violent and very explicit at times, a gruelling and realistic experience; with a bit of tinkering it could have been a masterpiece.",Brimstone
1,SnoopyStyle,structure siphons off tension,5,21 January 2018,"Liz (Dakota Fanning) is a midwife in the harsh old west. She is mute from the lost of her tongue and adversed to guns. She is horrified with the arrival of the new Reverend (Guy Pearce). Her fears are dismissed by her husband but he turns out to be a murderous psychopath. Joanna (Emilia Jones) is a teen girl found wandering in the desert and sold into prostitution.The opening Liz section is fine. It has a gothic epic feel although it does come off a little artificial. She could have been more convincing to her husband about the Reverend's evilness. She could have lied at least. It's one of those holding back information plot device and it feels manufactured. The second section with Joanna is awkward at first and the reveal is obvious before its actual reveal. It becomes obvious with the points where the plot must hit. The tension is siphoned off. When another reveal suggests a further connection, I feared a prequel to the prequel. Sure enough, that's what we get. Essentially, the tension is stripped out of the middle as the audience waits to return to Liz. The structure causes problems which may be covering even further underlying problems. I like Fanning and the evilness of Pearce if only the middle didn't drag so much.",Brimstone
2,claudio_carvalho,How Might Be the Heart of Someone that Writes Such a Story?,7,29 December 2018,"""Brimstone"" is one film that arises emotion and stays in the viewer. The long and realistic story is one of the gloomiest, most depressing, cruel and unfair without redemption ever written. However, let me make clear that the film is excellent and the viewer shall not give up watching in the beginning. The screenplay divided in four parts - Revelation, Exodus, Genesis and Retribution - is perfect, disclosing the non-chronological saga of the protagonist Liz / Joanna. The cast is magnificent, with Guy Pearce representing the personification of evil and Dakota Fanning difficult to be recognized in the role of a ""cursed"" woman, supported by Carice van Houten and Kit Harington. The locations, costumes and cinematography are top notch and the haunting music score is also magnificent. The only question that remains is how might be the heart of someone that writes such a story? My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Amaldiçoada"" (""Cursed"")",Brimstone
3,kosmasp,Western Memento,8,5 October 2018,"A western in 3 acts. And all give new if not completely different perspectives on the story and on the characters. It's really well made and has a few surprises. So it does warrant multiple viewings. Just to see where what happens and what it means for the story and the characters involved.It's mean and it's gritty, just like some of the best western dramas you may hold very dear to your heart. So if this is your cup of tea, you may feel like some of the reviewers here and call this the movie of the year (whichever year it was you watched it). And while slow, it still packs quite a lot of punches (violence wise, sometimes of the mind, sometimes literally).",Brimstone
4,classicsoncall,"""If you don't obey the rules, you're guilty. And if you're guilty, you're gonna pay.""",9,11 August 2018,"Told in a series of flashback narratives before returning to the present day of the story. ""Brimstone"" is a harrowing look at the life of a woman on the run from her past but irrevocably forced to confront the man who destroyed her successive families. One would be hard pressed to encounter a more despicable villain in cinema than the character of The Reverend (Guy Pearce), who's interpretation of the Bible goes only one way, and that's to his evil advantage. He is so sinister in fact, that he knows his immortal soul is eventually doomed, yet pursues his mission of hate filled revenge against a daughter who had the temerity to stand up for herself. There are times when a non-linear story is a problem, but here I thought it worked quite well without being too confusing. The technique was particularly noteworthy in explaining how the young girl Joanna (portrayed by Emilia Jones) became the woman named Elizabeth Brundy, upon assuming the identity of a murdered prostitute in the town of Bismuth. This following a successful escape from her home before further abuse could be dealt by her preacher father. The revelation that The Reverend is in fact Joanna's father doesn't come totally out of left field if one follows the story closely, but still registers a shock that carries through for the rest of the picture.I probably would have given this movie a ten rating but a number of minor points detracted from a perfect score. There was no explanation for the behavior of Eli's (William Houston) son Matthew (Jack Hollington) in his denial of Liz (Dakota Fanning) as his real mother. If there was resentment against her because she replaced his own mother who died, that wouldn't have been too difficult to explain. Then there was the latrine hanging scene in which Samuel (Kit Harington) killed his partner. The logistics of that scene really didn't work very well, as it seemed to me that the guy being hung had better leverage than he made use of, his feet continuously slipping off the latrine seat which was all he would have needed to save himself. His scattershot firing was also ill placed, had he shot straight up all three times he might have scored a hit to save himself as well. Having never experienced that type of situation, maybe I'm just being too critical.And finally, there was Liz's escape with her hands tied behind her back when The Reverend got the upper hand in the cabin. I don't doubt that there may be a person limber enough to pull off that feat, but I think the odds dictate against. Still, it was a triumphant moment for the aggrieved woman after witnessing the cursed Reverend flay her daughter while stating ""I will beat your mother out of you"". For the moment, it was a temporary victory for a woman who decided at an early age that she would never be one to turn the other cheek. It was not surprising then, that when arrested, Liz's final act of triumph would be to take her own life, rather than succumb to the frontier justice of men who interpreted laws in their own fashion.",Brimstone

6,bombersflyup,Hell awaits you.,1,11 March 2019,"Brimstone is just a horrible viewing experience. Why the film was made and why anyone would like it, disgusts me.Only a sick twisted individual could make such a film. The acting's fine however. Kit Harington's character dies stupidly, I don't understand why he'd be in a minor role. I like Dakota Fanning as well, but I would assume at least a quarter of the people who watched the film, watched it because of him. The church goers just sitting there like everything's okay, with his wife's face locked up.... I'm done.",Brimstone
7,trashgang,Dutch gem,8,18 April 2017,"How do you review this flick. Not that easy because some say it's a western but for me it's a lot more. The performances are sublime, the story is excellent, the cinematography is top. By now you got it, this is a Dutch gem. Even as it clocks in over 2 hours it never bored me and there's a lot of talking going on. Don't watch it for classic Western style. Just watch it for it's critic on religion, on how women were treated.I can't really go into the story itself because I would spoil a lot, just go watch it sit and see what a perfect flick is all about.

8,deloudelouvain,Dark but good,8,16 April 2017,"It's been a long time since I didn't watched a good western like this one. Not the typical cowboys versus Indians western but more a thriller drama from that period. I think it shows good how badly women were treated in that time. Not that everybody was like that but I can perfectly well imagine that the opinion of women didn't really matter in those hard days. The story is well written, with the right amount of suspense, but is sometimes hard to watch. Some scenes are very degrading for women. Guy Pearce does a perfect job playing The Reverend. He's a disgusting character and you wish the worst happens to him, but that's also due to the good acting skills from Guy Pearce. Dakota Fanning did also a perfect job as well as the young Emilia Jones both playing the young and older Liz/Joanna. The soundtrack adds something special to the already dark ambiance of the movie. The surroundings and nature shots are perfect for the movie. Even though it's not shot anywhere near the movie is supposed to be it certainly looks like that.",Brimstone
9,Hellmant,Powerful filmmaking at it's best!,10,28 April 2017,"'BRIMSTONE': Five Stars (Out of Five)A western thriller about a girl that must protect her family from a sinister new reverend, and the past they share that brought on this horrible conflict. It was written and directed by Martin Koolhoven. The cast features Dakota Fanning, Guy Pearce, Emilia Jones and Kit Harington. The film got really positive reviews from critics in Europe, and at festivals, but it's also oddly gotten mostly negative reviews from critics in America. I agree with the European critics and the festivals.Liz (Fanning) is a mute housewife that's trying to fit in to a small town. When a new reverend (Pearce) arrives there, she knows she can't trust him and she fears that her family is in great danger. The reverend also appears to have great mistrust for Liz, and he seems to hold some kind of a sinister grudge against her. We later learn, through three more chapters, why the two have such a horrifyingly unhealthy relationship with each other.The movie is powerful filmmaking at it's best. It's also as disturbing as hell though, and it made me feel completely depressed (and kind of awful) while I was watching it (and after). It's so well made, and acted though (Pearce is amazing in it). There are so many totally involving and nightmarish scenes in it too, that will haunt me forever probably. I have to respect a film like that. It's 2 hours and 30 minutes long also, and it's never dull or a chore to sit through. I think it's an epic masterpiece, and a film I'll never forget; despite how negative it might make me feel, about life and the world in general. It's also a great female empowerment tale too though. The world is a screwed up place at times (often). It's also a very beautiful place too, but we need movies (and all types of art) that masterfully illustrate both. This is one of those dark art masterpieces, that deserves to be respected I think.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/217879519",Brimstone
10,cosmo_tiger,The intense religious aspects are sadistic and the interaction between Liz and the Reverend are enough to give you chills,7,10 April 2017,"""Many people believe that God does not approve of violence. They have not read their Bible."" Liz (Fanning) is a happy wife and mother living in a sleepy little town. Things begin to change when a new reverend (Pearce) shows up. Liz senses danger but no one is believing her and when something terrible happens Liz is left trying to clear her name, and forget her past. This is a movie that is just flat out disturbing. Fanning does a really fantastic job of acting in this but Pearce just steals the movie. His character is so terrifying, without being over the top. The scariest part is that there are actually people like him today. This is a movie that is hard to watch. The intense religious aspects are sometimes sadistic and the interaction between Liz and the Reverend are enough to give you chills watching this. This is a good movie and worth seeing, but because of the content and the feel it is one that is really hard to recommend. I give this a B.",Brimstone
11,westsideschl,Reverend Trump,8,16 April 2017,"Positives: 1. Sets, locations, props, costumes all authentically spot on. A rarity when period productions come from the US, but this is European based and follows other US Westerns created in Europe that surpass what we do. 2. Storyline was authentic from the perspective of showing the worst of US western mining town life. 3. Acting did it's job, perhaps too well as it was obviously discomforting to a contemporary sterile plastic mass produced society clientele. Negatives: 1. Too much raw lifestyle for the sedated crowd. 2. Doesn't portray institutionalized religion in a highly supportive fashion; disconcerting to many. Interesting side note: Part way through I was struck by the following: How much the Reverend's behavior reminded me of Trump. Besides the obvious finger wagging, non-sensical verbiage, and shouting was the misusing of the Bible, and, of course, females - all for personal gain. On the other hand the film also showed how some women allow them selves to be submissive, and accept - even justify - male dominance of their lives, resulting in violence towards them; which the movie more than made clear.",Brimstone
12,Reno-Rangan,The trouble that had never let her alone.,7,13 October 2017,"A story about America, Hollywood cast, but produced and directed by outsiders. A powerful film. Kind of mix of 'No Country for Old Man' and 'Les Miserables'. The narration divided into four parts. The first episode called Revelation. An introduction life around Liz, but full of suspense after every unexpected turn in the story. Then in the second episode called Exodus, a young girl, Joanna introduced and following the third knows as Genesis, goes ever further back into Joanna's life, before returning to Liz's in the fourth known as Retribution.Maybe Dakota's best performance being an adult actress. As well as the young actress Emilia Jones. They both had played the same character, but in a different timeline. Interestingly, in real life, they share the same birth day and month as mine. From one of the film poster, I thought it was Michael Sheen. Only realised while watching the film that it was Guy Pearce. From writing to the making, it was a very good film. But the story could make some people uneasy. Because everything that's happened between the people and their relationship, not for soft guys. Yet it is a must see thriller, a must see western.7/10",Brimstone
13,tomgillespie2002,An exercise in misery,4,26 November 2017,"Only a few famous cinematic figures can get away with using their surname only when headlining a poster or introducing a movie's title. Schwarzenegger and Stallone get away with it, as would the likes of Spielberg, Kubrick and Hitchcock if they were that way inclined. In an incredible display of confidence in his work, Dutch director Martin Koolhoven opens his latest film with the title of 'Koolhoven's Brimstone', a brave move for a filmmaker few outside of the Netherlands will have heard of. He clearly takes himself very seriously, and Brimstone just may be the most serious film of the year in the way the director soaks the film with such a biblical doom-and-gloom atmosphere that it would be difficult to watch without a chin-stroke or two.Focusing on the life of a young mute woman named Liz, played by Dakota Fanning, in a particularly brutal Old West, Brimstone is a commentary on both the strength of woman and the sadistic nature of man. Liz holds a position of respect in the town due to her midwifing skills, but when a problematic birth leads to a decision between mother or baby, she is targeted by the residents as a murderer. Things get worse when The Reverend (Guy Pearce) walks into town. He is a stoic, imposing figure eager to reinforce God's fury to his congregation, and expects total obedience in return. Liz clearly shares a history with him, and is eternally terrified in his presence. This is the first of four stories played out of order, flashing back to Liz's time in a brothel under the orders of violent owner Frank (Paul Anderson), and forward again as Liz tries to escape the clutches of The Reverend.At first, the non-linear narrative structure is interesting, unfolding the story carefully in order to reveal truths that change your outlook of the story. When the film finished, it felt as though it was a mere distraction from the boring central plot. Brimstone is a film about punishment, and the 149-minute running-time seems like a deliberate choice from the director to punish us in the process. It's a gruelling watch; alongside the violence and misogyny of many of its characters, there's also paedophilia, rape, incest, infanticide and hangings. It seems to wallow in the very things it is rallying against, particularly an uncomfortable scene in which The Reverend humiliates his wife (played by Carice van Houten) and forces her to wear a metal bridle in an attempt to destroy her. Things liven up slightly when Kit Harington's injured outlaw arrives on the scene, but by this point you'll be too beaten down by the relentless atmosphere for it to make much of a difference. Brimstone is bold and will likely provoke discussion, but ultimately little more than an exercise in misery.",Brimstone
14,cruise01,Unsettling mood but overly long.,5,18 April 2017,"Brimstone has that unsettling tone for a western thriller but fails on managing to have a well set pace. It has a talented cast, and Guy Pearce played a Reverend well with dark behaviors. The film follows Liz (Dakota Fanning), a mute, and she aids in delivering babies in her small town. Until, a Reverend (Guy Pearce) shows up, preaching and punishing those that don't follow his beliefs. Liz and her family are tormented and stalked by the Reverend, which she knows a secret history that is slowly catching up to her. Brimstone does have a well-set cast; I mean Guy Pearce was creepy and haunting with his performance. Even, Dakota Fanning did okay, and Carice van Houten and Kit Harington brief moments were okay too. The script written by Martin Koolhoven felt so flat with the characters. Even with the plot breaking into four chapters and not following in a chronological order just to add a bit of history with these characters did not help the movie at all. The movie did have potential in being good, with a tone and direction that feels like it was in Salem and people were accused of witchcraft type of era. But the development with the characters was non-existent. For two and half hour running time, the characters were still forgettable. I also thought the film was slow and dull after the first hour. For being two and half hours, it really dragged on for a while. The tone was unsettling and had some moments which was hard to watch. Especially, with the Reverends acts and punishing Liz, Anna (Carice van Houten), and her young daughter. Those moments were disturbing and creepy as it goes over youth and sexuality. The direction tried to set a good western thriller but left behind with a boring script and an overlong movie.",Brimstone
15,eddie_baggins,One of the bleakest films you're ever likely to see,4,24 July 2017,"I've seen a number of films in my lifetime, more than I'd care to count but there's barely a film that I can recall being bleaker, more downright depressing and genuinely tortuous as Martin Koolhoven's Western epic Brimstone.Without an ounce of light or sunshine for over 140 minutes of runtime, Brimstone's ability to throw its characters and in turn its viewers under the bus time after time is some sort of feat and makes films like Dancer in the Dark and The Boy in the Stripped Pyjamas seem like a walk in the park and in an odd way this makes Brimstone noteworthy for Koolhoven's ability to stay stern in his vision in offering up an unflattering view of humankind, in the unforgiving surrounds of the American wild west.A passion project for the Dutch director and one that he fought hard to have final say over, Brimstone's non-formulaic telling of Dakota Fanning's mute Liz's battle with Guy Pearce's demented, sadistic and purely evil reverend is told in chapters that take us continually back in time too offer an insight into what set up this seemingly endless fight between the two characters, is a narrative that will have many turning off the film before it even threatens to culminate into its long coming conclusion.There's beatings, abuse, animal killings, despicable acts of violence and Kit Harrington's crimes against acting and nothing in Brimstone feels like it was over before we knew it, Koolhoven wants us too feel every little glum moment of these characters torments, both inwardly and outwardly and its within his stoic commitment too not shy away from these atrocities that he draws out a noteworthy turn from his main actresses Dakota Fanning and Emilia Jones as the young Joanna.Often not allowed to act through words, Fanning delivers one of her best turns outside of her early I Am Sam and Man on Fire work while relative newcomer Jones does a fine job of being a part of a narrative that doesn't hold back any of its punches for its young star.Where Brimstone falls down in a major way is with Pearce's turn as the reverend. The Australian actor goes too the store and buys out the deli of ham with his badly Dutch accented, child abusing and Abide with Me Singing maniac. It's not an easy role, Pearce has too act out and deliver some gruelling acts but had the actor or perhaps another performer nailed the role, Brimstone's consistently depressing nature could've been elevated by a great performance of one of recent cinemas most atrocious villains.Final Say – Brimstone is an extremely tough watch, one that will have many unable too bare it and while this sometimes starkly captivating Western like none other is at times haunting in its vision, you can't help but escape the feeling that this harrowing experience isn't worth the arduous journey come the finale, despite the best efforts of its two lead female performers.2 entrails out of 5",Brimstone
16,jtindahouse,Smart and highly memorable,9,10 October 2017,"For me to enjoy a longer movie (anything pushing 150 minutes) is rare. Some of my favourite movies also happen to be around that run time, but when a movie is that long and you're not enjoying it it can be absolutely punishing. Fortunately, I thoroughly enjoyed 'Brimstone'. In fact I'd go as far as to say I loved it. The film is crafted exquisitely. It's broken up into four chapters, and each one of them is as strong and intriguing as the last.The weaving of the story and the time pieces is masterfully done. The story starts with a mystery of sorts and then is revealed to us with a reverse time line. Of course once one thing is revealed to us another mystery is opened up and henceforth the formula goes. There is a lot of intelligence and thoughtfulness put into this script, that much can't be doubted.The cast also do a wonderful job of selling the whole premise. The stand-out for me was Guy Pearce. He was captivating to watch and I thought he nailed the Dutch accent (something he claims was very hard to do). Not far behind him was Dakota Fanning. She had a very different type of role, a role that could be considered a lot harder to pull off, and she too got it spot on. I mention those two in particular, but it has to be said the entire cast was fantastic. There wasn't a weak-link among them.There's a lot to love here. There are some scenes of brutal violence that are incredibly powerful and will stick with me for a long time. There are also a lot of implied messages along the way too which I really enjoyed. As previously mentioned this is a very smart film, even smarter than some may give it credit for. I would thoroughly recommend giving it a watch.",Brimstone
17,dworldeater,Master class dark and disturbing modern western,10,23 January 2021,"Brimstone is an incredible film, but this is not for everyone. This is a very bleak and unflinching vision of the west that is taken from the point of view of an abused woman and her struggle to survive. Dakota Fanning is excellent in this role as is the rest of the cast. This shows the dark side of Christianity and how it was like to be a woman in the times of the rough and unforgiving American frontier. The film pulls no punches in depicting violence and is deeply disturbing and dark movie. But this is also extremely well written, directed and acted. The film is very powerful stuff and Guy Pierce gives his all for a completely sadistic performance as a deeply disturbed and evil preacher. Guy Pierce is one of the finest actors there is and is completely immersed and absolutely believable in whatever role he plays. Brimstone is a completely appropriate title for this film and as such is a vision of Hell on Earth. This is not a popcorn movie, if you want to feel good, you are better suited to watch Driving Miss Daisy. But having said that, this film is exceptional but does not go down so easily like a chocolate milk shake, more like 100 proof liquor.",Brimstone
18,AudioFileZ,A Unique Horror Western Combination With The DeFacto Morality Theme,7,13 March 2017,"Brimstone plays as a 4-act western with heavy elements of a lawless and immoral time elevated to the brink of a horror movie. In other words it's 100% dark. It certainly has deep themes one can decipher differently and wrapped in mystery which the two middle acts slowly unfold like nested Faberge eggs of what it is about.A lot rests on the performances of ""The Reverend"" played by Guy Pierce and Dakota Fanning's Liz. Pearce has played heavies before and he exponentially multiplies it with a devilish off-the-charts creep factor which makes him, perhaps, the most hated celluloid villain imaginable. Dakota Fanning proves in one fell swoop she's not going to be remembered only as child actress. With slight dialog (she wasn't always mute) she proves how amazing she can be when given an exceptional role. It's great to see a classic western (the good/the bad) re-invented in such a way that the morality play is totally fresh. Brimstone is a harrowing ride from the start right up until the lastand like a train wreck you simply can't help turn away from. It's not like anything the long playing genre has seen so be aware the consensus seems to be highly polarized. This reviewer found it worthy, your mileage may vary.",Brimstone
19,areatw,Gripping storyline makes this truly miserable film worthwhile,6,9 June 2018,"It's impossible for anybody to say that they 'enjoyed' this film, because there's nothing at all to enjoy. It's a dark, bleak and utterly depressing film from the first scene to the last. What makes 'Brimstone' worth watching is its gripping storyline, first rate cinematography and fascinating bunch of character. It has the feel of a high end, expensive production and is difficult to fault in a technical sense.'Brimstone' is brutal and uncompromising in its approach and features no end of violence and torment. This contributes to a tense and depressing atmosphere which remains throughout the film. A lot of people will be put off by this alone, and I wouldn't recommend watching this film if you aren't in the mood for something emotionally deep and powerful. Those who give it a chance though are rewarded with a very well made film with a gripping storyline that, despite the truly miserable tone, is definitely worth your time.",Brimstone
20,brchthethird,A brutal and harrowing Western,8,15 April 2017,"Brutal. Harrowing. Unforgiving. Just a few words that come to mind that succinctly describe the experience of watching BRIMSTONE. If you like/don't mind the unsavory and uncompromising in your entertainment you'll probably enjoy this. If you like languidly paced art films, then you'll probably enjoy this. Otherwise, you might lose your patience. The narrative unfolds slowly and methodically, but the payoff is mostly worth the time taken to get there. Aiming to keep this spoiler-free, a brief synopsis is that a new minister (Guy Pearce) comes to a small Western town, and this puts a mute woman (Dakota Fanning) on edge, especially after a miscarriage puts her at odds with her fellow townsfolk. One further important detail is that the film is divided into four chapters, and the first three of these unfold in reverse chronological order. The movie centers around Dakota Fanning and Guy Pearce's characters, and the narrative structure allowed the director to withhold key information until the right time. Of course, like many other films with unique narrative devices, remove it and the film wouldn't be nearly as effective. That being said, there's plenty of stuff that goes on in nearly two and a half hours. A little indulgent? Sure, but all of the narrative elements are good enough to not make this much of a deal-breaker. I will say that the pacing, though slow, was steady and I never got bored. Thematically, Martin Koolhoven (the director) was able to use the period setting effectively to portray a world of religious coercion and the lengths men will go to justify oppressing women. Guy Pearce's character was basically evil incarnate, and it was a scarily brilliant performance. Dakota Fanning also did well, certainly better than I've seen out of her before. Kit Harrington also had a small role as a man that Dakota Fanning's character secretly nurses back to health, and who also teaches her a valuable lesson. From the more technical side, I greatly enjoyed the beautiful cinematography, and the haunting score by Tom Holkenborg (aka, JunkieXL). All things considered, this is one of the best films I've seen in a while, Western or not. For some reason, Europeans seem to do a better job nowadays tackling this genre, and BRIMSTONE is no exception. As long as you're a somewhat patient viewer, and not easily offended, I can highly recommend this.",Brimstone

22,sergelamarche,T2 1880 USA,8,13 December 2017,"Evil is there in the church, in the reverend. Great acting and no hiding violence and sex much, the story is very well casted. Great acting. Great images. Great story line, epic, spanning some decades. The reverend is a psychopath akin of the Terminator 2 model liquid metal. He kills easily and efficiently but is hard to kill. His daughter goes to great length to escape. The film is a good representation of psychopathy, to which the reverend is a typical extreme example. He can't know love, only abuse. His life is hell no matter what. His quote: In hell, it's not the fire that is painful, it's the lack of love. 
This film is haunting and only a few bits are pushed too much to the point of ridicule. The gun to shoot pigs is reported as goof. The wife hanging in the church is over the top and reminiscent of Clockwork Orange. The grandfather killing is too easy and noiseless to be believed.",Brimstone

24,redrobin62-321-207311,A Solid Presentation.,7,14 February 2020,"What is it with Guy Pierce and ultra-violent films? In some ways, ""Brimstone"" resembles his Australian western ""The Proposition."" Both are known for their brutal and sadistic violence. At least here, in ""Brimstone"", the women weren't forced into the story - they were integral to it. In ""The Proposition"", the sergeant's wife, Emily Watson, was simply out of place and completely unnecessary other than to have a little eye candy for the men and a person a female moviegoer can relate to (if that was the film's intent). Guy Pierce's acting was better here; he was truly believable as a twisted man of the cloth who, like thousands of preachers worldwide, ""bend"" the scriptures to their own warped way of thinking. Too bad that millions of suckers (so-called believers) tolerate their BS because they're as stupid as dirt. Recommended.",Brimstone
25,Patient444,Excuse for torture porn.,5,5 December 2017,"Now this is going as a personal opinion, nothing more, I don't want to start a debate here, but I am going to explain why and how I saw this movie.The actors are great, the directing works just fine, the environment looks natural and the story flows nicely. But you see it is labeled as horror, or just thriller even, but does it deliver in such way? Will you get any suspense, intrigue, will you ever hold your breath? No! Most certainly no such thing will occur. What you will get instead are torture and porn in every single chapter of the movie. And it thrives on it, like a wolf in sheep clothes, pretending to be something it is not while it acts almost like a snuff movie. Very disappointing approach the director took here and I'm sadden by the fact that he managed to get away with it.I noticed it was well received in Europe and surprise surprise, America was the one to point the finger, righteously, as Brimstone will try to shock you with gore, bent values, no morals whatsoever and torture all the way. All the way! You will not believe how low it will sink in order to steal your attention and make you feel something but for the very wrong reasons. Now here is where you have to pay attention: plenty of folks out there are die hard fans of a very similar movie called Martyrs. These two are somehow different than others like Serbian Film, so don't get the styles confused, but don't think you'll see anything too different either. If Martyrs was the film for you then be prepared to see something perhaps slightly better developed. You could enjoy it.For me it was a huge disappointment. One or two steps away from Human Centipede. Such movies don't belong on the screen.Cheers!",Brimstone

27,latinfineart,"A very good film, but harsh and unsentimental",8,23 June 2017,"I cannot say I really enjoyed watching this film. Not normally what I would describe as entertainment. It takes a toll on you. Pearce turns in a masterful performance as the preacher from hell. He does not have a spiritual bone in his body. He knows absolutely nothing of God. Yet, he seems to fool the masses, who follow him, rather than fire him! He should be run directly out of town, with no hesitation. It is a parable on religion, and the rather blind, sheep like behavior of some practitioners of a rather orthodox, joyless brand of Christianity. If it can be called religion at all. If anything, he could be referred to as a Wahhabi style Christian. This man possesses such deep hatred and such loathing for all things female. And he uses his position of authority to inflict extraordinary amounts of punishment on all of the women who are unfortunate enough, to come within his sad, pathetic, dreadful periphery.The film is beautifully shot in Hungary, Spain and Austria. The acting is exceptional and convincing. Fanning was tremendous. Harrington was good. Pearce was phenomenal. I finished this film, and was about to write a rather critical review of it. Something told me to hold back. By the next day, I had a whole different view of the film, which is often a sign of a very good film. It stayed with me. It had a haunting quality to it, a chilling, mind boggling effect. It feels like real life, in a sense that there are people out there, like this hateful, rat preacher. This film was a very convincing story.Sometimes, it was a little difficult to follow the time line of this film. But, the direction was solid, and the film was quite an impressive effort.",Brimstone
28,stevenrotherforth,A fine piece of filmmaking that's appreciated not enjoyed,8,23 September 2019,"BrimstoneThis is a depressing movie that is often unsettling and hard to watch.
That said It's still boasts some fine filmmaking.
Martin Koolhoven has crafted a movie that has a unique style of storytelling.
Played out in reverse order for the most part Koolhoven's style is truly engaging.
His film tells the tale of Liz a young woman trying to build a new life after escaping the evil clutches of her abusive and rather psychotic father.
Guy Pearce is terrifying as Liz's father and gives a chilling performance as the Reverend.
He constantly pursues Liz eventually catching up with her as she tries to live a peaceful life.
Pearce is almost demonic in appearance with black eyes and scarred features.
When ever he is onscreen he commands attention.
Dakota Fanning plays the adult version of Liz but it is Emilia Jones as the younger version of the character that almost steals the show. Only Pearce's performance is more captivating.
There's strong support from Game Of Thrones veterans Kit Harington and Carice van Houten.
Their screen time is limited but their contribution adds much to the story.
Brimstone is violent and doesn't shy away from scenes showing morally wrong acts. At times it can be hard to watch and I wonder if the actors, Guy Pearce in particular were unnerved by their performances.Brimstone is a good looking movie with excellent cinematography, fine editing and a fantastic musical score by Junkie XL.
This film has excellent visual quality and audio is cinematic making for a enthralling experience
I truly appreciated this film.
It's very good but to say I enjoyed the events transpiring onscreen would not be the correct choice of words.
It's a fine addition to the genre and well worth your time.",Brimstone
29,twelve-house-books,Horror Western Subgenre,10,2 August 2018,"There are a number of ways this film can be understood. A revenge tale, a tale of the insane Old West, a tale of pedophilia, a Slasher film, or maybe a Cautionary Tale about following anyone in organized religion--especially since Jesus never established any such thing and does not require it. Go back and study that if you contend with me, but you'll still be wrong. This is a deeply disturbing film, and sadly will not become a Classic Western like Dances With Wolves or Hostiles--and this is because of the horrid subject matter, being basically that a psychopathic father who is also a fringe Dutch preacher twists Holy Scripture to prove that since his wife won't be intimate with him that he has the right to take his 13-year-old daughter to bed. And he does, of course. Later in the film, he comes within minutes of raping his daughter's 8-year-old girl. Best line in any film, and I paraphrase: ""It's not the flames of Hell that hurt the most, but the absence of Love."" The absence of God. The separation from God. That is Hell. Many of us experience this even before we die. He did. What about you?",Brimstone
30,coreyjdenford,Due for a stoning,4,29 September 2017,"This review of Brimstone is spoiler free** (2/5)THERE'S A SHORT yet successfully fertile history of European directors tackling the Western genre, a phenomenon which has on occasion produced memorably unorthodox imagery of a perhaps mythological American past. Dutch writer-director Martin Koolhoven takes on this lineage with his English-language debut Brimstone. However this nature of a traditionally stunning narrative is short lived as he spends most of the film's punishing 148 minute runtime inflicting humiliation and trauma upon his female characters. A film populated by yellow-toothed, slightly feral, vilely perverse men preying on women for pleasure. As a plot the film is split into four chapters each named from Biblical terms there's Revelations, Exodus, Genesis and Retribution, in each of these chapters you're plunged into the story of Guy Pearce's vengeful Reverend and Dakota Fanning's mute midwife Liz. His story is filled with revenge and hate after losing his wife and seeing his daughter escape from his clutches. He listens to the word of God enforcing pain on the people mainly women who betray him, by using each chapter of the story he enforces a new method of torture, each more brutal than the last. Liz's story is perhaps the easiest journey, in the beginning of the film she's a mute midwife happily married to Eli (William Houston), hers is a modest lifestyle working with her young daughter to deliver babies across town. As soon as the new reverend comes in she's terrified of him, and as the film progresses her story comes to play. In the 2nd and 3rd chapters her life opens up, as a teenager played by Emilia Jones she learns about the values of being a woman constantly plagued by pain. This comes at a use to her later. Her performance though mostly mute is fantastic, the emotions that she goes through aren't expressed by voice, her facial expressions contain the most emotion whether she's panicked, terrified or shocked - each emotion gradually paints a picture of her pain. A brave and honest performance which gives little polish. Unfortunately this is soon dragged down by Pearce's flagitious villain. The usually reliable Pearce is compounded by Koolhoven's poorly written dialogue and an iffy Dutch accent which produces little fire from his veteran face. But you'd need to have some strong resolve, and perhaps need a strong stomach to match it. As Koolhoven desperately tries to give Brimstone the same audience-unfriendly measures from Lars von Triers' Breaking the Waves or perhaps Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight except without any of the intricate storytelling or indeed any of the complex characters attached. In short, this is a poorly handled, poorly written Western which sacrifices good storytelling for the glorification of suffering women. VERDICT Passable in the storytelling of the two leads but in the end this brutally hellish Western ponders along with female abuse and not much else.",Brimstone
31,Tak005,DARK SUBJECTS NOT ENTERTAINING,1,10 December 2018,"The subject matter is very dark, including incest and child sexual assault. Whilst those matters should be exposed and eliminated. As to whether they should be portrayed in such a horrific manner in a film would be the subject of debate. Despite the fact that this movie maybe we'll acted. This has gone beyond drama, and regardless of what possible good intentions of the creators were it is not entertainment. Unless for whatever reasons you enjoy movies that are so dark they are extremely depressing and upsetting I would give this movie a wide berth.",Brimstone

34,ferdinand1932,Cimono and Calvin,4,24 March 2017,"This is an amalgam of the more difficult Westerns with big themes and atypical, even anti-heroes, etc etc. At two and half hours it is convinced of its own significance. Unfortunately such delusion and imitation will not be enough to elevate this derivative film to anything like the level of importance to which feels it belongs.Let's consider the duration. In two and half hours Shakespeare managed to do many of his plays, comedies and histories, all better than this. In the same length of time Wagner managed to convey up to 75% of his major works, which by comparison, were more developed artistically than this and also pushed the boundary of the form. By contrast this pretentious Michael Cimono effort, uses length as a cudgel to convince the unsure that it surely must have some merit being as long as it is. But no; it is just long because if it was a standard length the vanity of the writer-director, would not be gratified. There's a portmanteau term - writer-director - that is almost an oxymoron.The story which is the center, the purpose, of this work has certainly been well done in the Western genre. It is curious how the historical reality of 'the West' differs so much from the exploitative imaginations of movie makers which drip with violent fantasy for spectacle. Such predictable cruelty is dull after a short while and also, humorous, because to maintain the level of horror, the filmmaker must raise the degree of violence to greater heights which become less engaging.The degree and style of the violence in this movie is gratuitous but it also could be said to merge with an Old Testament type of narrative and that book had plenty of nasty retribution. Even so, and especially toward the latter third of the film, there is a streak of Calvinism which augments the running cruelty with another layer of moral perspective. Calvin's influence is seen too in the art direction and clothing: it's grim and awful, and black in the wardrobe is essential.The issue of it being entertaining is almost superfluous: this film is too meaningful - at least to its makers - such that the question of entertainment is unnecessary. Borrowing from others; padding the timing; coating a few layers of religious creed won't make the product important or great. At its heart, it is a simple and rather ordinary western tale, which had been done many times, with less slashing and bleeding.",Brimstone
35,WubsTheFadger,Brimstone,9,26 January 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off the story is one of the most intriguing, dark, depressing, and outright sadistic story's I have ever seen. The power behind the plot is incredibly strong. The grittiness and brutal tone make the film extremely entertaining. My eyes could not leave the screen. The ending left me stunned and shocked at how a masterpiece could be disliked by the critics.The acting all around is very good. Guy Pearce, Dakota Fanning, Kit Harington, Carice van Houten, Ivy George, Paul Anderson, and William Houston all do a great job at portraying their respective characters. The weakest performance goes to Jack Hollington who is dry and emotionless. The best performance goes to Emilia Jones. She has such power and grace in her performance. She makes you connect to her and almost makes you fell her struggle. The pacing is perfect. The film is separated into four chapters that perfectly fit together. The runtime is also perfect. By the time the credits rolled I wanted more.The violence is at times extremely brutal but it symbolizes the harshness of the world the characters live in.Pros: Intriguing, brutal, and shocking story, great acting, an outstanding performance by Emilia Jones, perfect pacing, gritty and consistent tone, and a perfect use of violence and nudity that furthers the storyCons: A poor performance by Jack Hollington and the dislocating shoulders scene which didn't make much sense (I didn't put this in the review because it would be a spoiler)Overall Rating: 9.4P.S. This film has been added to my favorite films of all time list. The story is powerful and left he stunned. This film is a must see.",Brimstone

37,rutzelb,"Good, but Brutal, Disturbing and Shocking",7,29 April 2017,"The story opens when the new Preacher (Guy Pierce) starts off the prayer service and Liz (Dakota Fanning) sees him she is scared for her life. It's quite obvious that she knows who he is. The Preacher admits he is out to take everything away from her. This is basically her story. I don't think I have ever seen such a brutal, disturbing and shocking Western as this one. The Story is told in 4-chapters: Chapter 1: In the present, Lis is a mute and a mail-order bride to a man with a son. She had a girl Sam (Ivy George) with this man and she uses Sam via sign language to verbalize what she wants to say to others.Chapter 2: We see her past life as a prostitute.Chapter 3: We see her first family life and here her name is Joanna played by Emilia Jones, who does an Oscar-worthy job. Chapter 4: Is Retribution. Having seen all that went before, we cannot wait for this one. I don't think I have ever seen Dakoa Fanning do a better job than what she does in here. Kudos. Oscar-worthy? Yes. In a word, this is hard to watch, at times, because of some of the brutal, disturbing, bloody and shocking scenes that are pertinent to the story and even I had to avert my eyes several times. Tension and suspense are always close by. Despite my feelings regarding the subject matter, the acting by all was excellent and it is a good script and we do see some excellent cinematography. I just hope that future Westerns do not copy the total reality of what we see in this one. We can only hope. The ending surprised me somewhat. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, and quite graphic too.

38,deacon_blues-3,Warning: Anti-Christian diatribe!,1,4 August 2018,"A viscous polemic against Christianity, contrived to put Christians in the worst possible light. It sets up an outlandish twisting of Scripture as the basis for a diatribe that panders to the paranoia of secularism that all Christians are to be feared as deluded, evil psychopaths who only desire to make others, especially women, miserable and oppressed. No sect ever interpreted 1 Corinthians 7:36 as condoning incest with one's daughter. Even the Old Testament vehemently condemns any such notion. This movie's goal is to provoke paranoia and persecution against anyone who tries to live a Christian life according to the Bible. Dangerous!!!!!",Brimstone

Even Tarantino f*cks up this conceit.Why, why oh why juxtapose the order of events? Arty? Add mystery? Suspense? A new form of storytelling? Because 'I wrote the damn movie and I can'? Yeah, that's about it. Do you think he wrote the movie in a linear fashion and then split it up or did he write the first bit and wondered where the hell to go from there? Frankly I don't give a damn.If you can't tell a story forwards, it's not going to be any better if you tell it backwards. Or is that too difficult an idea to process?Second observation - writer/director. It's over-long and self-indulgent. I keep making the point that not all writer/director movies are bad but I must qualify that now by saying just 99.9% of them! Can't fault the actors - just the script. I can only imagine the cast needed the money.OK, maybe it's not 'that bad'. Let's try drawn-out, needlessly-confusing, over-inflated, trying (far, far) too hard and, again, self-indulgent - let's indulge this writer/director's whims and fancies. Indulge, indulge, indulge.It's storytelling, Jim, but not as we know it. Or want to know it. Unless you're an art-faced, pretentious sycophant.So you may get the impression that I didn't like it. If some goddamn person had held Koolhoven to account then it might have been a decent movie.

I don't need a Hollywood ending per say, but with such a dark tone throughout I was hoping for something better in the end.So for me it was a tough movie to watch and just kept getting harder and harder to watch, where I debated 2/3 in about turning it off.

(At the risk of being thought a pedant, please allow me to insert the following: Denouement: the final part of a play, movie, or narrative in which the strands of the plot are drawn together and matters are explained or resolved.)Yep. That telling moment when it all comes together and you say to yourself, ""Aha! That's why she did that and he gave her what for and then all those other guys ended up dead."" Ahem. You get what I mean.For making me feel perplexed and a bit like I was treading water (pun intended), I have to blame someone-----so, I am going to blame the script writers. Should I blame the director? The film editors? Beats me. All I know is: for a while there I thought maybe ""Liz"" was undergoing some sort crazy disremembering thing. Not ""getting it"" kinda ruined the ending for me, just a bit.The cast is wonderful. The way this is filmed is terrific. The scenery is extremely eye-pleasing.Be prepared for major plot holes, however. I kept saying to myself, ""Well. That was stupid. Why didn't she . . ."" And so on. There's plenty of need for suspension of disbelief. But it's so much fun watching and waiting to see what's going to happen next, I think that fact should be overlooked.The time sure went fast, while watching this. I really enjoyed seeing Kit Harrington as a cowboy. I found having ""Melisandre"" in the same film as ""Jon Snow"" a bit distracting, though.And I must admit that I was absolutely waiting and waiting and waiting to see Carice van Houten's breasts again, as I think she has the prettiest boosies ever. We barely caught a glimpse, though, which is a real shame. Why show the bar girls' subpar tatas and not revel in Carice's glorious ones? Her chest could have done with a little more screen time, is all I'm saying.Other reviewers wrote about the graphic violence. Yeah, there's a plethora of gory scenes. Life was tough back then. Papa Preacher was an over-the-top sadistic, screwed up maniac, that's for sure. I think the gore went to character. Personally, I could have done without the dying pig.In summary: I liked this movie.

Arrrrgh!When will they learn that they need someone else's artistic direction to tell them that they are making a mistake!When our heroine was standing hidden in the corridor, and the priest was sitting in the lounge room, I knew that if he suddenly, unexpectedly knew she was there, my worst fears had been confirmed. He then said, ""I know you are there"" (paraphrasing). How? Did he have esp? Our writer/director never explains. He/she (as in the director) knows, and we are just expected to accept it.The bad guy certainly seems to always be in the right place at the right time.This film is obviously the directors pet project, and he/she has decided to cut nothing.

If me and the other viewers should feel lucky about seeing an uncensored directors cut, I don't think we do. I don't.This has unparalleled scenes with violence toward children. Even violence to other characters in-front of children. I think children should be shielded from violence.I think that some of the worst violent offenders are exposed to violence at a young age and that they become indifferent to it. I don't understand what the director was thinking. He's dutch and after seeing this film thoughts of the danish writer and director Lars von Trier came to mind who is also quite well known for graphic depictions of violence.I think that the director has a few different messages expressed in this film about 18th century religion, witchcraft and that period in new England history, but all is all overshadowed by the degree of violence and even some graphic gore.I think our young heroine took on this project to make a departure from adolescent roles.

The acting was amazing, yet the monkeys with guns vote 1/10.......Rant over and so to the film....... Told in 4 chapters it is an extremely dark, yet compelling tale of what appears a mystery cum horror but as the tale pans out it is actually a supremely told tale of an abusive husband/father. A sick example of how aligning oneself with religious beliefs gives the abuser carte blanche to carry out heinous acts upon others, especially those closest. Inconceivable? Just think of the catholic priests abusing children. I cannot stress enough that you need a strong constitution to watch some of the abuses carried out. Guy Pearce in his best role since Momentum is compelling in a role that you cannot turn away from, in fact like a car crash, you cannot avert your eyes to his evil deeds and Dakota Fanning clearly demonstrates her ability to transform from a child actor to female lead in her own right. I gave The Revenant 10/10 and genuinely I enjoyed this more so a 10/10 is a given. Even the child actors showed maturity beyond their years to make this a faultless, absorbing story.

52,DBLurker,"Wow, just wow..",9,28 November 2017,"This movie lasted for 2 hours, 20 mins (excluding the credits here). I actually took a break after Chapter-2 and was shocked how long the movie was. Do note, I did not check the time cause I was bored. This movie is worth sitting through.The amazing acting, the violence, the religious bullshit on full display.. all of it immerses you as a viewer, into the life of a tortured woman whose whole life was filled with pain and suffering. I don't really wanna spoil any of it because this movie has a simple plot, but it's the execution that really shines (from director and actors).Though I must say, I DO love the fact that this made the American religious nutcases so uncomfortable, that they rated this movie down to oblivion. I guess when someone puts a mirror to your faith and shows you how backward and horrifying it can be, just like other Abrahamic faiths (Islam), you start kicking and screaming like kids.The same Americans who are happy with banning sex in games and movies, while being OK with violence and guns, did not like this movie at all. I wonder why? Here's the best part. People like the reverend in this movie, still exist (priests, mullahs, popes, whatever you wanna call them). Their victims still live the lives of female characters in this movie. Religion is a gift that keeps on giving.Watch this movie, it's worth it.",Brimstone
53,SteveMierzejewski,A Study of Degradation,2,23 April 2017,"Unnecessarily violent and perverted. This is a study in degradation, pure and simple. Don't be fooled by those who claim this is an uplifting story of a brave woman. If that were true, it could have been done with far more subtlety and accomplished the same end. I have no idea what producers think the movie-going public want, but if they want this, as a society, we have fallen to a level that we would be wise not to reveal. This is a movie without any redeeming values. True, they try to make it so with a begging-for-forgiveness ending and heroic music, but I didn't buy it and you shouldn't either. The actors should apologize for participating in this travesty. Don't waste your time or your integrity.",Brimstone

A frustrating mess of a story which is acted astonishingly well by all concerned. The story is very much in the vein of a horror where everyone does really stoopid things otherwise the plot doesn't go very far... which of course means the tension doesn't build as you're always thinking ""that just wouldn't happen cos people aren't that consistently dumb""... then again maybe I'm too generous.",Brimstone

Wow..i'v heard so much about it in the press over here..like this is a must see masterpiece. Well, it's awful..barely watchable...all clichés so common in dutch filmmaking pass by... I'v heard that this is a huge movie about violence against woman and that woman prevail in the end. The story is obnoxious.. stupid scenes like a guy who gets blasted trough a window 'cause of a bullet hitting him. Over the top & silly scenes...the pace is awful it leads to nothing..the acting of the cast is merely mediocre...especially Guy Pierce's role is sooo unconvincing. I'v heard promising stories of the shocking scenes that would keep you awake at night..so horrendous. I never saw one scene that came close to such an emotion. It's a long and boring feature...that holds a very unoriginal approach and filled with (dutch) movie clichés. A film that shows why the majority of mainstream dutch movies suck!

A mute young woman who apparently has a miserable past with the new reverend coming to town.
Her husband being killed by the reverend - stung in the stomach and strangled with his own guts.
The man's boy who has to shoot his father to stop the pain.
Their house is being burned down.Chapter 2;
A young woman, Joanna, who walks confused around in the desert is picked up by some Chinese and sold for prostitution at the Inferno.
We find out later that it is the mute woman from chapter 1 and find out how she went from being Joanna to Elizabeth... a long, tough trip from a young girl in a whorehouse to pretending to be someone else she can escape.Chapter 3;
Finally, we get to see Kit Harington. He has been shot and have killed some men, but we don't know why, to start with. In chapter 3 we go back in time - Joanna is Joanna and the reverend has not yet got his scar from his visit to Inferno (from chapter 2).
We get to see how evil the reverend is - punish his wife hard because she dosen't want to sleep with him and she speaks her native language, Dutch.It is just so sad to see all that she has been through, just to get arrested for a murder her friend commitet and the kill herself :(There is nothing hidden in this movie. We see everything from rape, western duels to burning people, man get eaten by hogs and bullet holes through the skull.
It's an excellent movie, but a little strange how they've put it together... a lot of jumping back and forth - sometimes a little confusing.Guy Pearce is so good in this movie, as a cruel reverend who uses God as an excuse to do bad things and treat woman like garbage.",Brimstone
58,CtlAltDel,Almost,6,18 June 2019,I give it 6 stars for trying to do something original with the genre. Without elaborating on the plot (which you can read elsewhere) the film was beautifully shot and the first half (the whole film is actually too long) was really working. The main characters believable and the sense of dread all pervading. But the second half just undoes all the good work. Guy Pierce's evil minister just comes off as comical in the end. I had no issue with the more extreme moments in the film - and they ARE extreme - but they end up reaching levels of absurdity. It's a waste of what could have been a truly gripping film.,Brimstone

The time-jumps, poorly executed, just add to the confusion and desperately try and grasp onto your attention with ridiculous plot ""twists"" and inexplicable and unnecessary cruelty just for the shock value, just to get a bunch of idiots to say ""it's dark"" in reviews. It's cheap writing, and it's poorly disguised amongst the flashbacks in which everyone looks exactly the same.

This is an epic experience and one that requires a full immersion. The acting of the leads is first rate. It never come across as staged intensity or false. The filming is so vivid and the coloring intoxicating, the sound score painfully delicious. Every scene is gorgeous and powerful. There may be points where a degree of disbelief must be suspended, but this movie is part horror, a statement about the danger of extremism and religious power as well as the treatment of women. The power of the priest does seem surreal and beyond human so the few moments of feats of extraordinary ability are within the range of the narrative of the film. This movie is probably best watched in stages, to allow each portion to be appreciated and to being overwhelmed by it. One of the best experiences I have watched so far.",Brimstone

It accomplishes that with ease even.And lets say for a moment even if this film would not nonchalantly offend alt-right and religiously delusional hypocrites a like, purely from a cinematic standpoint BrimStone is a stunning piece of work.I found that the characters, the story, the dialogue, the camera and lighting was so well crafted that the the sum of it all quickly pulled me in. BrimStone has that mesmerizing quality that lets you forget everything else around you while watching. The main villain was the most detestable character in a very long time. No spoilers here, but wow... The classical music is absolutely beautiful and fits the theme, emotions and story extremely well. Somewhere i read that this film was 5 years in the making. And it shows every well crafted moment.We watch films for emotional connections. And this film does connect so masterfully. And if you are unable to accomplish such, or find it hard to follow a simple story, there are still plenty of explosions and leather clad superheroes to brighten your day in other recent productions. Don't watch the trailer. Ignore the insecure alt-right internet crap storm. And jump straight into this film without any spoilers. That way BrimStone is the most enjoyable experience.

65,makka-00955,Dark and Depressive,5,8 April 2017,"This movie isn't for the faint-hearted - it's very dark and verges on the edge of being distasteful. There is no light and shade to it and that is why I only gave it a five. I think there could have been brighter moments in amongst the gloom. It's oppressive, depressing and on the edge the whole way through. Guy Pearce is excellent as the murderous preacher, but his character does go within a hair's breadth of being a little too perverse. The slightly odd way of showing events in different, later-merging segments, works quite well, but may annoy and confuse some viewers. It's hard to sum up, without giving away too much, but it centers around a young woman, pursued relentlessly by a uber-puritanical preacher, who takes religion to a whole new level. Some of the scenes may upset; there is violence aplenty: sexual abuse; paedophilia; incest; spousal-abuse; self-flagellation; rape, voyeurism and sadism and that can be a little wearing, as the oppressive feeling never really lets up. It's not clear at first, as to why the preacher has a bee in his bonnet with the young woman, but that becomes clearer as the movie progresses. The ending left me a little dissatisfied - it could have lifted the mood, but only deepened the depressive tone. It's not a 'feel good' movie, by any stretch of the imagination and when the titles started to roll, I found my self exhaling and saying wow! but not in a particularly positive way. I'd never watch the movie again, simply because it is so depressive. That said, it is powerful and a real assault on the senses, but it's not going to be for everyone.",Brimstone

67,pronins,Wow... Ridiculous,1,15 September 2017,"I really don't write many reviews but, having just watched Brimstone, I couldn't help it... Let me just say that I'm a big horror fan and have absolutely no problem with violence or gore in movies, even if used only for shock value, IF it's done right. This of course is not a horror film by any means. It's a wannabe thriller with no point, no message and, worst of all, the director is trying to make you believe it has the depth of a Tarkovsky film. It makes no sense in terms of character development - the main female character, who has witnessed and also committed horrible acts of violence, who has been tortured by her deranged perverted father, who had the guts to cut her own tongue out at one point just to be able to fake her identity, suddenly becomes a scared little bunny when the main villain who had destroyed her life finds her again and wants to keep tormenting her... She takes no action whatsoever which, by this point in her story would be highly unlikely... She doesn't even warn her family that the new reverand is basically the boogie man. I mean, the guy survived getting his throat slit wide open, entered the house somehow (while the female protagonist was guarding the only door) and murdered her father in law in complete silence, than magically appeared in front of her, then kept it cool and motionless and even remained talkative while being lit on fire... If this was supposed to be a supernatural thriller, it certainly wasn't convincing, since this super villain died way too quickly in the end. All of the violence is mostly against women, and the end didn't feel redeeming at all - hardly any retribution really... So many bs religious references, attempts at survival genre, elements of horror, thriller, western, drama, 12,000,000 budget - all for nothing. If some violent movies such as Hostel or The Human Centipede at least offer shallow entertainment due to the dark humor, this movie takes itself so seriously that even the supposedly ""shocking"" violence leaves no impression. I'm not even going to get into script flaws (for example how the reverand decides to rent the whole bordello for some reason so that nobody catches him doing it (also in another town) then just happens to instead stumble upon his daughter that just happens to now work in that particular town at that bordello, and it all happens precisely on the very last day before she is supposed to run away... I mean, my god... etc......) Don't watch this film - not because it's violent, iconoclastic or upsetting (they just want you to find it controversial, it's really none of these things). It's just a boring, predictable, pretentious film that has no point and is absolutely empty in every way.",Brimstone

I agree with reviewers who say the synopsis is nothing like the actual film.Let's face it, if the film were aptly described it would read:Hateful one dimensional men who are cruel and debasing toward all female characters. A brief unexplained respite of a pseud-good semi-hero that is immediately shot so the torturous world of woman hating can resume. The film as a whole is tasteless and these founding fathers of religion and the west leave a really bad taste. Fire, brimstone and punishment along with a whole lot of meaningless twists and turns.I can take a film that meanders and doesn't have a happy ending- Manchester by the Sea delivers this style much better in my books. However Brimstone appears to be written, directed and filmed by men and women who are so desperate for cash they couldn't turn down the work. I shudder to think any sane or rational person would think this film worthy of making. Simply put, there is nothing enlightening or entertainingly about this film.

These stages wrap the main theme in itself and, in a fine way put it to the beginning on the very end. Makes this perpetuity one of it's points: how some flaws and psychological elements haunt us through generations. Almost like a curse, a generational misfortune. Film is also making a strong point about extremes of human nature, which is I guess one of the main subjects of the author. And wide span it is (the human nature): from the harsh violence to the best of strength and excellence against it. Put in strong inter-generational context of parent-child. The movie is not simple and is really SLOW, even for a more conservative viewers. The tone of human nature and violence in it reminded me in some moments of ""There Will Be Blood"" (for from a comparison please) and many more such psychological-driven dramas.

The gruesome kills and vicious shark-like nature of this movies protagonist, played terrifyingly well, by Guy Pearce, will keep you glued to your screen, even with the long run time of 2hrs plus. Dakota Fanning is at the top of her game here, in a role that requires her to show, not tell. She and Guy Pearce are the main reasons why Brimstone is as good as it is, while young actress, Emilia Jones, also delivers. It's a slow burn, so for those with a lack of patience, this movie might seem tedious, but for myself , the performances, the unexpected brutality and the strength and tenaciousness of our heroine Liz, makes Brimstone a must see.

If you want your movies to be feel goods and with a happy ending then this is not the movie for you. Life in those days in that sort of environment was sometimes unforgiven. This movies is unforgiven. Now they have professional help for people with a very disturbed mind but in those days a Jack the Ripper kind of person could get away with basically everything. Maybe the minister was a bit over the top but wasn,t Jack the Ripper? And maybe there was no remorse in his character but is that perse a thing when a person is as sick in his mind as that. And also maybe he can shoot better in the mist than a sniper on a clear day and moves better around than a navy seal but that is movies for ya.
Nobody would ever believe a female victim and under the shield of extreme religieus believes the woman is placed under the man. So female victim, endure it, or else you must be under the wings of the devil and be punished.

Guy Pearce played a reverend who must have been special ops in Sweden and was perfect for pursuing his poor daughter. The ironic tale is plain dumb and tries to pass itself off as artistic but miserably fails. The resolution made me regret watching this stupid tepid movie. I can see the point the movie was trying to make about the absence of women's rights back in the day but it was more of a showboating technique with no real depth. If the mute woman knew of the treachery of her father then why would she attend a church he was the pastor of with her family. Why would she not tell her husband about the stuff this dude did before?

78,joecoby45,Great cinematography and an impressively committed performance from Guy Pearce are not enough to make this memorable.,6,16 January 2018,"As a movie there is plenty of impressive things about Brimstone. For one its an ambitious movie with how it try's to tackle its big story (dividing into four parts played out of sequence). However It doesn't really feel necessary to be non chronological when watching it, but it does lend itself to some pretty good reveals here and there. I for one would have found the movie better if it just stuck to the first and last chapter and had some of the backstory explained cleverly with good dialogue. This would have made the movie tighter and less lengthy. Some other impressive things about it are its production design, cinematography, and performances by its entire cast. Special mention must go to veteran actor Guy Pearce who gives an impressively committed performance as per usual. Always the chameleon, Pearce disappears completely into the role and he is what makes this movie most memorable. With that being said his character as well as most characters in this movie are fairly one dimensional and lack depth. Maybe make his villain a little less evil with a sympathetic side and maybe make Fanning's protagonist role a little less perfect and add a darker side. Just a thought, but as an aspiring screenplay writer I find its a good idea to add as much dimension to your characters as possible to make them not feel so black and white.Another problem I had with this movie was the way it went over the top with its extreme violence and sadism. They could have just as easily made their point (whatever it was) without excessive gore. Here are a couple examples...In part one of the movie a character is stabbed by The Reverend but instead of just having him be stabbed and bleeding to death we see his intestines have been brutally ripped out of him and wrapped around his neck like a noose. I don't see how that was necessary except for shock value. In fact this movie riddled with shock value and it makes me think that i'm watching a B rate horror film as opposed to a western thriller which is not a good thing. Another example is in a couple places in the movie a young girl is horribly whipped (yet again by The Reverend) It didn't add to the story it just made it uncomfortable. In summary Brimstone is a good movie with plenty of potential for greatness but unfortunately it squanders that potential with excessive violence/sadism, and a drawn out story with too long a run time. Shame, it could have been something special with a little more focus.",Brimstone
79,dpbertrand-126-427929,As dark as it gets,7,22 March 2017,"I have read a few reviews regarding this movie and all of them have said it's dark, violent and not for the faint of heart. Those definitions are fine, however I still do not think this is enough to describe the tone of the movie. I would describe it as ruthless and depressing. This does not mean I didn't enjoy it, as you can tell by my rating, however the point of a review is to warn a potential viewer of what they are getting themselves into and this movie is as dark as I have seen. It is unlike any western that I have ever seen as it is not traditional. It's so unique that I would have given this a bit of a higher rating if it wasn't so hard to watch. I do not want to ruin any of the plot as it made the movie more interesting for me just based on what I had seen in the trailers. I can see why it was set in the western time period due to the realism of the material. A movie like this set in our times would have been impossible to make, and if they did it would not have been executed as well as this. The acting was quite impressive. It truly feels like each actor really threw themselves in their roles, which is incredible for some as there are some twisted characters in this film. Which brings me to Guy Pearce who played the role of 'The Reverend'. He plays such an awful man that I have no idea how he would have been able to shake this off after filming was completed. I cannot remember the last time I hated a character as much as a despised him. Dakota Fanning was also amazing in her role. She was convincing from start to finish with many different emotions throughout the movie. She also needed to use facial expressions more than dialogue in the movie, which cannot not be an easy task to complete, but she nailed it! When I had first seen the length of the movie I was concerned it would have major passing issues, it did not. The story grabs you from the beginning to the end, I couldn't stop watching. I had no idea how it would end and could not wait to find out. The most impressive part is it really did not have a lot of action, just characters that grabbed your attention whether good or bad. It was well written. So if you are not of the faint of heart and can handle a very dark, ruthless, depressing story that is still entertaining from start to finish see this movie, you won't regret it.",Brimstone

88,nelleke-97387,Two hours of psychopaths is too much,1,17 January 2017,"Waisted TOPtalent (director, cast) because the story is no good. Characters do not develop at all, no mystery at all..just a lot of blood and death. No historical foundation, because for example a minister or vicar is always surrounded (in Protestantism) by elders-ten. So no vicar could ever do these things not-being- watched..and don't underestimate the 'watchers' in the dynamic of something happening like this. So this is more of a catholic priest with much more power, to get to this point. Of course rare events happen, and there are people going mad and can be psychotic about religion and sex..but this has nothing to do with religion itself..people go crazy about the tiniest things, if it is inside them to 'split up'. So this story is about a lunatic and to watch this lunatic for two hours is too much for me. Why wasting such great talents and money for such a boring, horrifying story? There's horror enough in the daily news. So, in my eyes, even the most beautiful images can not hide the lack of content.Thereby: I'm very worried about the development of the cinema, because stories get worse, technique's grow, and money reigns. Like as if investing in rockets, they cost a lot, and most of them never reach their destiny..because they do not know where to go. So we get all this stuff in our stratosphere which hides the real stories..which can also be horrifying, but they will tell us WHY en WHEREFORE..Plain nonsense this is..because it is not about common religion, like it was brought to America from Europe. Religion (see f.e. Scientology) can be even more dangerous, because it is hidden in everything..and it is so close to the truth that people can hardly distinguish it from the truth.So be smart and don't go to this movie, it saves you money and many bad influences, because there's enough of this already.",Brimstone

The movie is full of thriller and horror. The plot is kind of 18 century. The story is really good and hold its audiences pretty well. They have shown such a thing which is highly inappropriate even for fully grown person. Like incest, beating a kid brutally, covering a women's face with some metal thing so that she cannot talk. The movie contains moment when things happen out of nowhere and many ""damn!"" moments and you will end up asking ""why? why am I seeing this brutal movie"" and the answer is you want to know what happens next, Did that psychopath guy died.

It was NOT that. The first and biggest problem I have with the movie was; it doesn't play in chronological order, which is a pet-peeve of mine. The story is broken into (4) parts. This is how the movie plays, part 3-2-1-4 so each segment is out of order.
Otherwise, the story is brutal, gruesome and violent. They touch on child abuse & rape, more than once. They focus on the oppression of women in the sense that, the only thing women are good for, is working in the brothel and servicing men.
The Minister is so hateful, that I cheered when he finally died, however, many other good people died for no apparent reason, and our hero dies in the end. This is NOT a feminist movie, nor does it celebrate the strength and resolve of our main protagonist. It is garbage from beginning to end.",Brimstone

Someone (Eleanor Roosevelt?) said you could say truths in fiction you can't in real life. Koolhoven has done that. I don't want to repeat other user reviews, but I have a few comments I didn't read in other reviews (admittedly I didn't read all 200+):Sexual abuse is not just the story's challenge, it's a metaphor for a toxic patriarchy.The end highlights the pervasiveness of the patriarchy.It's less about faith being a problem than about the misuse of religion for power. The description of hell is apt. How can love exist in the Reverend when his primary desire is for power, and his view of his women is that of property? He also promotes things treated as abhorrent in the bible as though they were recommended. His opening lines show what kind of person he is.This is also a movie about hypocrisy vs. honesty: Joanna/Liz and her mother are fighting to be honestly themselves, not to let others force false narratives onto them.The shots were not only often gorgeous by themselves, but beautiful in relation to each other. E.g., the visual of the girl fleeing her raping father echoing the horse running across the same field was wonderful.Thank you, Koolhoven, for showing Kit Harrington's funny side, hidden all too thoroughly by Game of Thrones. It was a very brief moment, but without a smile, the realism would have been undermined; reality has humor and beauty as well as horror. That awareness is what makes this a great movie.",Brimstone

And eventually adding up to a ruthlessly, arrogantly empty film that seems to pride on not even trying to give any hope of drama. Any attempt at defending this as art, mass art, folklore, or even a tale that might have moral against the religious zealous is doomed to be ridiculous.",Brimstone
94,markcalway,Miserable film that will guarantee disappointment,2,13 March 2017,"It appears they have divided the film plot into 4 parts. Someone has then shuffled those 4 parts and decided to play them out in a random order. Why not stick to chronological order? I understand that it is a good verses evil, but don't get the descriptions of a strong women battling. Guy Pearce plays a vile religious paedophile, amongst his victims is Emilia Jones as Joanna. It is a vile tale that I can see the reason for it to have been made or for us to watch it. It is just beating, hanging, torturing and rape of women and young girls. You want there to be real justice in a tale so miserable, not just more misery.For Game of Thrones fans you may be drawn (as I was) by it having Kit Harrington in the cast, but he's just a small cameo who has no real effect on the plot.At the end of it you won't feel any reward for wasting your time watching it and you won't want to recommend it to anyone.

This movie is definately one of those kind that is not easy to watch. Per se if you have more emotions than a piece of stone chip. It wont be easy..
And battle of ""good and evil"" is always some bloody too. But more of any its Survival story. I can find it realistic as in realife it can be very hard on many levels. So it definately can be that in movies..

This a slow thriller. It starts off slowly, and doesn't tell you everything until about half way through.
Brilliant performance by Guy Pearce. Seriously some of his best ever work. This is a sick, violent & very well made R rated thriller.
Once again i must implore among the people reading these reviews to not pay attention to religious fanatics down voting this movie. 
Oh no, there's a crazy perverted priest. Not a priest..
History is full of religious wars, priests preying on the weak and innocent. If there was no religion, the world would be a far, far better place in my opinion. 
All it does is divide people and create war. Sure, i know plenty of fantastic people who are religious. But like any race/religion we all have a mix of beautiful & ugly people.
Back to the movie..
For the first 20-30mins you will be saying to yourself ""What the **** is going on?""
But trust me, you will be rewarded. Half way through, the movie delves into the past and explains everything.

101,sacha_brady,Less is More; More is Less,5,26 March 2017,"I have never seen a film like this, one split into two very distinct dichotomous halves. Acts one and two are good, bordering on excellent. The plot is thoroughly intriguing, suspenseful and well paced, neither painfully slow nor hurriedly fast. I really liked the foundation being laid out both in terms of what and how. Fanning's character comes across as genuinely vulnerable in a refreshingly original way and it is clear Joanna is a woman with a difficult past. Pearce's character, the reverend, is the polar opposite, giving his character a real sense of menace with a skillfully understated performance. At the mid-point, I thought 'Wow! This is like ""The Crucible"" meets ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" I was thoroughly gripped. And then...In the second half, all the good work is undone. The story verges on the ridiculous at points as the film tries to explain how the characters had ended up at this point and thrusts us towards a pantomime resolution. There is a sense of overkill about all of this and I began to feel disorientated because of expedient plot and role twists. I am not exaggerating when I say I was speechless as the credits rolled.I wish I liked this film more, for the sake of all those involved in its making. If anything, the story of the making of this film seems far more dramatic and interesting than the film itself. It's such a shame.",Brimstone

105,esteemdancers-1,Great Acting and Script that Mesmerizes,8,11 March 2017,"This movie puts me in mind of people who stop to look at a horrible deadly car crash. To watch a horrible tragedy can make some of us feel better to say we ""can't look away,"" but really it's that we don't want to look away. It's normal sadomasochistic urges and fantasies that everyone has a certain degree of — the desire to think about or imagine hurting or being hurt — combined with normal exhibitionist and voyeuristic feelings, the interest in what is hidden and secret. It's the weaving of both of these sides, which is as old as time. I hate to admit it but this movie gives us excellent acting and great music, cinematography, scenery, and script that as I said mesmerizes and you can't stop watching. However, when it was at it's conclusion I just felt like I needed a stiff drink or to find the funniest movie ever produced and watch it. Quickly for relief. This movie is just too depressing. Dark movie. I am so depressed from watching this movie. I wish I had just stopped watching it but I kept thinking at some point the story would change direction to create a positive mood.

They suffered a lot. In this movie you will feel the culmination of all derogatory and disparaging treats to women. This feeling emerges as a side effect of all the scenes. It is the by-product of the religion, ignorance, and power exercise. Another brilliant piece of art urging reformation of the societal morals.I just wished that the retribution scene in the end wasn't so unrealistic. I do not understand why the director had to make it complicated near the end. That's the only reason I rated 7 and not 9 points.

109,Jazzy31133,Brutal and Brooding,7,24 March 2017,"After watching a movie I like to read up about it to learn how the movie was made, the inspiration for the screenplay and how the cast came together.While reading up on Brimstone I came across an interesting tidbit - the Dutch and European press gave the movies strong reviews, while the American critics were more lukewarm. For some reason, these facts really resonated for me.On the surface, Brimstone should be worthy of praise. Stunning visuals and a strong performance by Guy Pearce, brutal yet not gory violence and a non-linear, but not confusing story structure all work to create a satisfying movie. And more importantly, I believe that the movie delivers on its promise made in the trailer, the viewer will not feel hoodwinked that they were mislead; a la an action movie that is actually slow, or a comedy that turns out to be a boring, coming-of- age drama.Yet, after viewing the movie I could not shake the feeling of being let down, empty and unmoved. The goal of any film in my mind is to have the ability to stay with a viewer, and I felt as though Brimstone reminded me of a very well made straight to video movie.The example I will use is having a one night stand with a pretty girl yet you wake up the next morning without feeling elated. She looks the part and has a welcoming personality, but you have no interest in her.That's the feeling you get with this movie. Great cinematography and powerful acting, but I believe the missing link is a great story. There is no twist and no real character arc. It is a simple tale of hardship and revenge that tries to elevate itself through a non-linear telling.Final comment: Solid and violent tale in a western setting, with an average story and somewhat non satisfying ending.",Brimstone

Also, the cinematography was gorgeous.At first, I was going to give this film a 3/10 because it didn't seem to have any redeeming value. But it's really just about one small (ish) women who in a way represented all women of that time - seemingly powerless.
Fanning does an amazing job of gathering strength throughout the film until it seems like she will win in the end. That is until her past catches her, accepts her fate but also knowing in her heart her daughter may have it better. The director does a phenomenal job of portraying this doomed character arc.However, thought the Kip Harrington ending should've been done differently. And the sign language thing wasn't completely believable. Also, could've done without so much disgusting violence. Some wasn't completely believable.But overall, a very interesting film. Pearce and Fanning were worth the price of admission alone or by themselves. Without their performances, the film really wouldn't have worked at all. But also, great performances by the rest of the cast.The Reverend is a about a twisted interpretation of the bible brought to life, a despicable psyche, and how both have probably fed off each other his entire life to justify his actions at any given moment.",Brimstone

114,Showho,"Director needs to review classic cinema, and get some therapy...",1,24 December 2017,"Judas Priest this is an infuriating film. Chiefly responsible for this are a host of visually compelling, masterfully constructed set designs, costumes, solid acting and cinematography that are thoroughly wasted here as this film plays host to some of the most moronically vile males and pathetically weak female characters ever seen on a screen. Brimstone goes WAY beyond being 'merely' misogynistic, It relishes in both torturing its wrongfully accused female protagonist, (Dakota Fanning) and robbing her of any discernible empowerment in virtually every single scene, dramatic arc, & plot twist as she fights to flee a menacing extremist bent on her eternal cleansing. Further, it's painfully obvious this film's producers are intent in manufacturing their own insidiously twisted, murky, and supremely ugly take on Christianity. Having been raised Mormon myself, I know only too well the pitfalls of the 'Fundamentalist agenda,' and yes organized religion in America has been plagued with rocky roads from the beginning. This film however simply tries too hard with sensationally unrealistic, abrupt story arcs which are far too 'agenda pushing' to be taken seriously. For several years I've relished in the beautiful Carice van Houton and her supremely gifted acting chops and must admit she was a primary draw for wanting to see this mess. Having waited for nearly an hour and a half before she appears, one can only surmise that a solid paycheck coupled with the chance to get beaten up by her current companion, co-star Guy Pearce (as the thoroughly one-note extremist bad-guy) must have harbored some allure because she is wasted here. This cinematic tripe also shamefully stoops to authentic, on camera animal slaughter. Clearly QUALITY scripts are getting harder and harder to come by. Many of todays' cinematic auteurs are not doing their homework by savoring the classics and learning what constitutes quality story telling. Instead they've chosen to skip it and barrel straight into a more unabashed propensity for cheap shots and shock value over all else. Shock value alone does not a quality film make. Ensuring EVERY SINGLE COMPONENT of your film is top drawer is pointless without a well written script, and some semblance of humanity.",Brimstone

We still have so far to grow in this man's world. The truth usually is not pretty. This film is brilliant. Just look at all the reviews about how people cannot sleep afterward.

120,laufeyson-64475,"Worryingly Disturbing, But So Is Reality!",8,17 March 2017,"As a Western fan, I really enjoyed this movie, the directing, scenery and cinematography are very beautiful and nice to look at! The story is also very compelling, as it seems real and touches on the controversial topic of the difficult lives of women, however, I still wait for a contemporary movie about such difficulties, as physical, verbal and sexual abuse. It's still happening (no matter where you live!)and instead of making movies about a different century (where people cannot relate to), there should be movies about the contemporary problems and issues of women. Since the director is Dutch, I liked that the Reverend and his family are also Dutch, although he could not pull off the accent. I would have also preferred another actress instead of Carice van Houten, as she appears too modern and sexy - this sexiness which she also showed in Game of Thrones was probably enough to seduce Guy Pearce in real life. Apart from Pearce's creepiness and perversity, Dakota Fanning is the real star in this movie. She really impressed me. She was different in every scene, constantly shifting between being fierce, vulnerable, strong, attractive and frightened. I'm happy that she and Kit Harington were chosen at the end, as the previous actors who were under contract for this movie, Wasikowska and Pattinson, are horrible actors. No range and no facial expressions. They would have destroyed this movie and the audience could not have been able to relate to their characters and feel Liz' sorrows. Yes, the Reverend is sadistic, he is a pervert and ruthless. So is society. I can imagine that many perverts and creeps will watch this movie to satisfy their needs and debauched minds. I don't think that they will feel ashamed of themselves by watching it, as those people cannot be healed. Moreover, I want to give my personal opinion about the director Martin Koolhoven. I followed him on Twitter and read a few of his posts about religions and Islam. First, he defended his movie being not sadistic, but rather a feminist approach to a male-oriented Western movie. He asked for objective point of views and not being ignorant in their statements. However, he is also the same person who posts anti-Islam rants and pigeonholes them all. He reacted to those gay protesters who were marching for Moslems because of the travel ban in the US and claimed that the Moslems in return would have killed them, etc. Is this not an ignorant statement of him? Not everyone is the same. Just because he presents the Reverend as evil in the movie does not also mean that every Christian is evil. There are many modern, sophisticated, gay, feminist Moslems in the world. In addition, these Moslems criticize each other, too and hate those old-fashioned, stupid, misogynistic fellow believers. I think he should also try to be careful in his rants and arguments, because as far as I know, filmmakers, writers and artists are open-minded and peaceful people who are not ignorant about other cultures and religions and can distinguish between good and evil.",Brimstone

I didn't care that it was written in 3 acts, but I did care that for some reason it was out of order. It didn't add to the story at all. Another thing, it was grossly overwritten. They added so many scenes that were not necessary for storytelling. A good director and good writer know how to relay a story without building an entire 15 minute scene to convey a mood.

It was the movie that wouldn't end no matter how much you want it to. It just kept going and going, one twist into another twist into another. Ugg. The scenes weren't horribly graphic thank God especially given the fact that there's rape, incest other brutal injuries. The production was good, but not good enuff to make a difference. This is such a poor waste of acting talents. They got some really hot actors in this too, how did they possibly do that? Ugh!!!!!! This movie pisses me off!!

123,pigdogg,Brilliant Heartbreaking Gruesome Satisfying Unsatisfying,7,2 June 2017,"*** MINOR CONTENT STRUCTURE SPOILERS ***WARNING - This Movie is NOT FOR THE SQUEAMISH !! Don't watch this film and trash it because you were grossed out. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNEDOne of the most memorable scenes in ALL OF MOVIE MAKING EVER. You'll know it when you see it. The hand.The story is excellent. Riveting. Realistic and at the same time over the top. While you can believe any of the events that occur might very well have occurred in that time period under those conditions you will still be shocked repeatedly and to your core. While many scenes are gruesome none of the violence is gratuitous. This statement will confuse many readers but at the same time others will understand what is meant by this seemingly cryptic observation.I believe that chopping up the plot and telling the story backwards was an mistake. This was probably decided in post production during the editing phase to give the final product an uncommon spin. The continuity is compromised and you can tell that the writer/director had not initially intended this delivery. This complaint however does not completely undermine the effectiveness of the story it diminishes it only somewhat. Artistically oriented people will actually enjoy the decision.One significant error I feel was found in the balance between the time spent watching the sympathetic characters get the crap beaten out of them and the time spent seeing the evil antagonists getting their due. It is far to skewed in one direction. It leaves many viewers with a sense that the evil forces almost get away with it for the most part. This doesn't really leave you with a happy satisfied feeling. If you are looking for that from a movie this film won't do it for you. The balance is off in that regard.The quality of the acting, production, and cinematography (which is frequently stunning) is absolutely fantastic. I consider the casting of Dakota Fanning an error. She isn't right for the role except for the fact that her first name has a western feel to it - ha ha. A different actress might have been better. This is only a minor quibble. She did a decent job.Through much of the film this was in my mind an easy 8/10 but when taken in total and especially when considering errors in balance my vote would be a qualified 7/10. For the right people you will love this film. For the wrong people you will despise this film. Extremely polarizing. The people who rated it a 10/10 are being honest as are the people that gave it a 1/10. Remarkable.",Brimstone

Even as the reverend continually descended into more and more more depraved and disgusting acts, I couldn't stop watching this film. I sort of felt dirty afterwards, and perhaps that was the intention.However, I ask, what was the purpose of the degree of darkness and misanthropy depicted here? I don't know if there was an intentional effort to negatively paint Judaism and/or Christianity as inherently prone to producing this sort of a mad man, or if was the result of the belief that the male sex is the problem, or if it was a general depiction of an example of the ability of a human being to engage in the ultimate psychopathic self-justification by seizing upon a belief system and rationalizing and twisting it into whatever is needed to satisfy one's ego.I couldn't really recommend this film to anyone I know, as they would not be willing to even try to understand what this is all about.

137,galahad26,a weak script and flawed in many ways,3,29 March 2017,"Brimstone is flawed in various ways. The characters are underwritten and not interesting enough. The reverend feels like a comic book character and misses complexity. I don't see any internal dilemma or inner struggle. He is mainly 'the evil reverend'. This is also how Pearce performs him and you feel the lack of layers in his performance. If only the director had chosen a Bergmanesque psychology for him – a reverend struggling with his desires instead of him justifying his actions all the time.Liz (Fanning) is also uninteresting. She's mainly a small anxious rabbit (sorry Dutch expression), and she can't think of anything else than fleeing in her struggle with the reverend. She isn't very likable or challenging and misses complexity – therefore it's hard to identify with her. This lack of identification (and therefore tension) is one of the major problems of Brimstone. Often Liz has no goal. This has to do with the way the film is structured. The film is told backwards and this overloads the film with exposition. Each chapter starts with telling us where we are, who these new characters are and how we ended up here.Chapter 1 mainly relies on mystery instead of getting us involved with the main conflict and the problems the hero is going through. Experienced writers know you can build on mystery for a while, but not too long. But Koolhoven takes his time, a lot of time. Chapter 2 the first half an hour is again exposition and the main conflict only comes into play when the reverend returns. If you would have told the film chronologically the amount of unnecessary scenes would immediately have come to the fore. Chapter 3 again has a lot of exposition and feels repetitive. The reverend is saying three times his daughter is not a child anymore. Also, Kit Harington's character seems totally unnecessary. Why do we need to see the scene with the gallows on the toilet? And why didn't those two men kill each other already in the stable? I would have understood Harington's character when he would have been part of the moral journey of Liz. But this is the biggest flaw of the film. Koolhoven doesn't seem aware of her real journey. The only thing she does is running off and the events don't seem to gradually change her. More importantly, it doesn't lead to a Crisis in the third act – the so-called Final Dilemma, where Liz needs to choose between the lesser of two evils, with her making a sacrifice. For example, what if she would have to choose between killing her father but destroying her soul, and saving him? This would have created a central moral question in the film: how far are you allowed to go in destroying Evil? This would have been a real religious theme. Are you allowed to become the devil to conquer the devil, or do you need to stay good at all times? Such a dilemma would have created depth and all elements in the film would have become logical. Why such a reverend, why incest, why told against the background of the lawless Wild West with an eye for an eye mentality, and even Harington's character would have been functional: a good guy who can kill - a step in Liz' moral journey. Even the ending would have become logical when Liz would have killed her father at the cost of her own soul after which she's arrested for a murder she didn't commit. It would have been the hand of God – God's punishment for not making the right choice. The dark ending would have become bearable in all its irony. Instead Koolhoven chooses for a denouement where fate overcomes Liz. And although Liz could have easily defend herself with sign language, Liz is fatalistic, accepts her arrest immediately and commits suicide with a smile. Which of course should make me think she is free at last. She was a strong woman, the voice-over then tells us. Sure! I have a strong impression Koolhoven doesn't know what his film is really about. No, this isn't a film about feminism. Others before me had already concluded there are no strong women in the film. The lack of an underlying debate makes that the film falls apart in ideas and loose ends and this is also why the violence feels inappropriate and over the top. The slow pace in the edit and the horrifying violence betray that Koolhoven wanted to make an epic film in which he wouldn't avoid anything. Koolhoven foremost wanted to impress. You feel that agenda and this for me clarifies the negative reception in the international press. The film's backwards structure only services to hide the film's inner emptiness. Put the film together chronologically and the story is immediately very thin. And isn't it utterly incredible that Liz cuts her own tongue? Only to take on her friend's identity? Instead of choosing to hide herself in that vast country without leaving a trace (like she already did once very successfully as her father wasn't able to find her for like 8 years), Liz chooses a hiding place at least one person knows about.I really tried to like the film. Especially because the film deserves applauding based on the extremely demanding financing and production process. Beforehand I heard that everyone thought the script was superb. Watching the film I really don't understand that qualification, as the script is the film's biggest weakness.",Brimstone
138,NeonDisguise,"Wow, this is what cinema is all about!",9,11 March 2017,"I came into this film with moderate expectations and was completely blown away by the quality of the cinematography. The unorthodox yet ingenious order of the character development, the magnificent scene settings and backdrop, the sound and scoring, and the superb acting by EVERY actor (including the children)- it all paved the way for a spectacular cinematic experience.**SPOILERS | DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM**I really wanted to give this film a 10 out of 10, and at one point I was sure that I would give it a 10/10.The reason why I only gave it a 9 out of 10 is simple: the screenplay writing was flawed and lent itself towards some annoying moments where the characters made excruciatingly dumb and illogical decisions that either got them killed or at least resulted in extreme consequences.-Example 1: Liz (Dakota Fanning) should have shot The Reverend dead while she was outside on the porch with the Winchester Repeating Rifle aimed at his chest. Instead, she stupidly chose to put down the rifle and run inside to check on her daughter. Thus she got tied up and her daughter got whipped.-Example 2: Matthew (the son) stopped the horse carriage and then proceeds to be killed by The Reverend's perfect sniper fire ambush in zero-visibility snowstorm conditions. It was very hard to accept that this was written into the screenplay.-Example 3: Samuel (Kit Harington) has a chance to free Joanna in the church, and points the pig-killing pistol at The Reverend but walks right up next to him at point blank range, and then turns away briefly only to have The Reverend wrestle the gun back at him, thus resulting in Samuel's death.Aside from these screen writing flaws, the film was marvelous and represents everything that cinematography is supposed to be.Acting: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Sound/Scoring: 10/10 Scenery/Setup: 10/10 Screen writing/Character Decisions: 6/10Movie Overall: 9/10Thank you for such a great film.",Brimstone

Hell imagery throughout, which is appropriate for a preacher to whom sadism (and a whip) is no stranger. This tale is not for the faint-of-heart, so caution to those who may seek to enter.

Also, most men are horrible jerks or criminals, and the very few good men are dumb as oxen. Finally, why don't film characters ever realize that guns are NOT knives?

One of the main reasons I wanted to see the movie was because Dakota Fanning is in it. But I knew that she was raised as a Southern Baptist, so she would have known that the way the script was written went against proper scriptural meaning. But, maybe she was denouncing her Christian upbringing and was more interested in having a leading role.

150,jungerhanson,B movie pretending to be art-house...,5,15 January 2017,"The IMDb story line for this movie mentions 'unforgiving cruelty of a hell on earth'. That pretty much sums up the viewing experience I had. I like violence on screen if done in a tasteful manner, when it serves the story and has any actual meaning. The movies from Paul Verhoeven come to mind as great examples or Michael Haneke. But Brimstone is no Robocop or Funny Games and this director sure isn't Verhoeven or Haneke. This is no social commentary or essay on violence. It's a rape-revenge-story without the revenge.Brimstone plays like a B-type slasher / suspense flick with a ton of relentless cruel violence added on top of it. Sometimes it is used to good effect for example to depict the dire situation of how women were treated in the good old west. But this movie is no real examination of women rights during that period nor does it delve deeper in the godlike rights religious men bestowed upon themselves. Like I said it''s essentially a B-flick including a scene were a body is fed to the pigs. So OK this movie isn't very intellectually grounded. How about entertaining? Not really. The movie is very very slowly paced. It has a structure that is told out of sync (a bit like Memento) which actually saves this movie from being a total waste of good actors. That being said the film totally collapses in the last act. To put it short, after our main character endures a lot of bizarre hardship, cruelty and torture she finally gets to confront the bad guy in what is maybe the most anti-climatic scene I have ever seen. No sweet revenge or happy end to justify what just transpired on the screen. The bad guy dies in unspectacular fashion and as a reward our heroine is drowned. The end. I gave it 5 stars as this movies has some forgiving qualities. The acting is generally good and the first act of the movie is really suspenseful before it all falls apart. I like that the director seemingly didn't compromise to show us how bad the old West most likely was. But without any clear vision all the violence is just nasty for the sake of being nasty.",Brimstone

If you get upset easily this might not be the movie for you, but it's no Saw. Definitely not a date night movie. If you want a ""Who's who"" plot with some cool action this is the movie for you. It's not the most impressive, intricate plot ever, but it's told segmented and non-linear, which makes it significantly more interesting. Sometimes it's a Western, sometimes it's a wannabe Quentin Tarantino movie. It switches back and forth. Don't take it too seriously, and don't think too deep about the plot. Cinematography is good, the lighting in some scenes doesn't make sense but it's nothing that would detract from the movie. Guy Pearce kills it in this movie, he acts out a really strange role really well. I start movies at a rating of 5 and go up and down from there. This movie gets big points off the bat for Guy Pearce, who will keep you entertained the entire movie. It loses points for some pacing issues, and I wish the story after you ""figure out"" everything that's going on was a little more cohesive.

The violence is displayed for the purpose of displaying it, till it is simply saturated and you don't care about it anymore.The real violence is made towards the audience that has to wait an unspeakable amount of time to finally see the end credits.The themes are just drowned into a sea of useless scenes, inserted in the movie only to justify the casting of some actors.

The way how they showed it in chapters and how it describes the old western horror when religion was so crazy To this point...but thats the movie message was to give you this side of the thoes old days if you think that you gona enjoy the scenes or western fights ect then NO this movie is kinda a documentary but in a dark way to give you a glimpse to how things were and personaly I prefer movies like this when it only give it to you in interesting way...THIS movie only shows the violent side nothing enjoyable really and thats the main point when you watch a movie about history IT needs to be interesting...

It is beautifully made and it captured my attention till the end. I think the end of the.reverend is underwhelming and the ending perhaps unnecessary but the acting of everyone is good or great. Very impressed by young Joanna and Dakota Fanning. It doesn't deserve the bad reviews. Viewers wonder why the violence is necessary? As if real life isn't that violent? People and animals get brutally killed every day, women get raped and killed every day, priest abuse children, fathers abuse daughters, good men get killed. It is what happened and it is still happening now. Religion often only makes things worse as it often gives evil a reason to be evil. Religion isn't evil in itself, but it gets used so often to do evil. If you can't watch this it means you don't understand what humans are capable of.

163,saittham71,Calvinist torture movie disguised as feminist western,5,27 March 2017,"I read somewhere that it was a feminist western. I also read it had a strong (anti) religious message. These two things had me mildly interested, but – boy – was I in for a different ride... The movie is chronologically messed up and I understand why (more on that later). It starts with a mute midwife in a Dutch community, Liz, helping a woman in labor, while a mysterious reverend (Guy Pierce) comes to town. My first thoughts were that this reverend is going to make her life miserable because she is not letting God decide what happens with the women and their children and the rest of the movie will show the struggle between religious conservatism and science based progressNo. That's not what happened. Instead we switch back and forth in time to show that the reverend is actually Liz's father that lusts after her, that she escaped his evil clutches only to be sold into prostitution in a mining colony and that she cut out her own tongue to imitate her dead friend. The film basically is a shower of dread pouring over poor Liz. After 2 hours you are completely numbed by all the dreadful things that happen to her or people she cares about. It's about as ""feminist"" as the original I Spit On Your Grave was, except that it doesn't grant Liz any revenge at all. In other words: the ""feminist"" label is deeply deceiving. In fact, if you hate women and like to see them suffer, then this is an class A movie. The only thing that is feminist about it, is that Liz remains a resilient woman in spite of what happened to her yet not resilient enough to escape prostitution. So, after 2 and a half hours of misfortune, torture and pain you hope that the woman finally gets a chance to take revenge, but instead we get one of the most anti-climatic villain death scenes in cinema history. Then, in the epilogue her daughter expresses what a strong woman she was, as her mother is taken to be hanged. At that point you wonder if the secret message of the movie is how pointless being resilient and rebellious is, which is exactly (!) what orthodox Dutch Calvinism says.",Brimstone

168,mikoyan-51104,"Worth watching. Great start, failing finale.",6,14 May 2017,"Brimstone is an atypical Western about a young women (Fanning) who is confronted by her past, told in 4 chapters. From the start the movie grabs you: There is unease, tension, mystery. And sure, it is not always for the faint of heart. However in the last chapter, the movie crumbles. It just becomes too tiresome. The antagonist (Pearce) apparently is also some kind of superman and it all just becomes too silly, to a point that it becomes hard to still care for what's going on. Reflecting back, the plot also has some issues: Knowing what we know by the end, I wondered why she was so passive in her actions at the start of the movie.Acting overall was great though. Dakota Fanning was wonderful. Guy Pearce's Dutch-ified English was fun too hear too. 6.5/10",Brimstone

Its not that its a bad movie - all the whole it isn't. Yes, I agree with other reviews, its dark, violent and somewhat oppressive, but still highly watchable.But I have 2 major grouses. First its too long; there were several instances when I was bored waiting for the story to develop. Second (and a far more serious 'flaw' in my opinion) ; why O why do directors insist on non-linear telling of the story. Some years ago flashbacks were all the rage; now its seems that for some its impossible to tell a movie story without disjointing the timeline of events.

All and all, a valiant effort to turn over about every stone, unearth every moral taboo, and shine a blinding light on the ""true"" reality of the Old West!!!

The film's overindulgent run time is another red flag as to the film's opinion of itself. If you think you can derive a deeper meaning than ""men and religion bad"" out of this movie then you probably also read horoscopes and can predict the future by looking at sheep's knuckles. Anyway the film is well shot and produced enough but pretty overbearingly written. Throw as much nihilism and exploitation at the wall as you can and see what sticks. The acting is pretty solid. Guy Pearce made my skin crawl every time he opened his rat mouth. The segmented storytelling is a neat trick but the pay off is painfully predictably and the climax/showdown whatever at the end is resolved in laughable fashion. Turns out things die when they get set on fire. Who knew? Even demons from the pits of hell. Seems Guy Pearce cbf to take the tying women up course before he left hell either with the shoddy job he did. I dont write reviews but this film was so up itself I felt compelled.

The plot is bold in its narrative and very smart in the way it is knitted. Martin Koolhoven knows how to keep the tension throughout the film and to make it even more complex. The symbolic world of the movie is also profound and intelligent. Finally, the music has a classical narrative purpose and is also a plus. Pure cinematographic pleasure.",Brimstone
178,Iceberg4000,I hoped for so much more...,6,31 March 2017,"As a Dutch citizen, I was really stoked for this movie. The interview I've read with Dutch director Martin Koolhoven, who worked for years on this script and getting this movie made, was so promising. Now, as my fellow Dutchies now, our country's output in movies is still pretty worthless. I do really admire Koolhoven for pulling of a big project as this, I don't think there are a lot of Dutch directors who would be able to handle a movie on this scale(apart from Verhoeven, Kuijpers and Jan Kounen).Brimstone definitely has it's moments, with beautiful cinematography and strong acting. I do like that the story is told in reverse chronological order. The main thing I didn't like was the father, he was a too flat character. What could've been a layered, torn, religion obsessed man ended up in being a monster straight out of a slasher kind of Horror flick, who's only desire was to r*pe his posterity. Almost laughable. At points the characters have to over explain their intentions, using bible quotes (to really prove to the audience that the bible can be a base for this sickness? we get that okay...) Another moment I felt was really over explaining was how the daughter had to ask her mother how she could live under this circumstances. I mean, the mother was muzzled, I think just a simple disapproving look would've been enough. This lack of subtlety also displays when mother commits suicide in the full church, and preacher daddy immediately starts screaming ""this is a abomination and blabla"". I think the father would've been shocked for a bit, not that his wife was dead (he was a clear psychopath) but that she didn't apply to his rules. He doesn't have to shout all his underlying motives to get this plot point clear to the audience. Come to think of it, I'm happy there weren't 3 voice overs explaining the character's inner thoughts for the three viewers that could've missed it. I really feel that the story could've been build up more fluid, dragging you more in the darkness step by step (like the movie Dogville, for instance). Last thing that I didn't like were some of the sex scenes. I get the purpose, but some of it felt so ""Dutch"". As in bad. Like the scene for Frank's shooting duel, I get that the world of a brothel is special/different/interesting and you want to show that, but to me it came across as a bad Tiroler sex film bit. Still though, after all I said, I'd definitely watch a new Koolhoven movie because he there were enough promising and enjoyable things in this one.",Brimstone

183,kunal1323,Not for faint hearted people,10,1 October 2017,"Kinda late to review here but couldn't resist myself. This movie might be disturbing for some people, however one can also say that this is the perfect blend of horror, thriller and action genre. I am surprised to see why it hasn't been AT LEAST nominated for some top movie awards (perhaps it may offend a larger section of people who considers Ironman/Hulk real ... Just kidding).Now coming to the main points, the PLOT was amazing. The whole movie is written in neo-noir style which is also known as Quentin Tarantino genre. The movie is used to show how deviant people used religion as a shield to justify their heinous crimes.The acting was superb. How the hell Guy Pearce was not nominated for an Oscar for this movie (again it's my opinion) ??? At the end of the movie, I found him more DESPICABLE than the combination of Ramsay Bolton & Joffrey. Dakota Fanning was amazing in her role as well. From a helpless girl to strong-willed mother, Fanning has acted brilliantly, considering her entire performance was based on facial expressions. Other casts such as Kit Harrington, Carice Von Houten, Emilia Jones were amazing as well.The movie is slow and over 2 hours length. But trust me at the end, you'll learn that reality is not always what most movies show. The society we live in may not have God's angels, probably none. It may be dwelled by evil people, who will try to harm you. But it's your choice how you defend against them. You may stand as Anna, or you may stand as Joanna/Liz to fight them.Lastly, I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone. Believe me, it's disturbing in its own way. I was saddened for an entire evening after watching this one.",Brimstone
184,maartenrogier,That escalated quickly,8,12 March 2017,"The movie starts in the middle of the story, seemingly starting as a confrontation between a practical mute midwife and a very religious reverend with different views on life, quickly moving from mystery to thriller to horror. In a structure similar to Memento (also starring Pearce), the next section is a flashback showing the events leading up to the first part, and the one following that another flashback to the events prior to that, slowly unfolding the complete story; before continuing the events of the first part, which is pretty straightforward (but disturbing) horror.I didn't have any idea what the movie was about before I watched it, expecting a Western. And the unexpected turns made the movie more interesting to me. Wanting to figure out what had happened before and why, drew me into the movie.The movie is not perfect at all. There are some plot holes and weird decisions made by the characters. The acting was good but a bit distant, which fit the characters but it was hard to connect. The actress playing Joanna (Emilia Jones) was the standout performance for me. I enjoyed Pearce's performance too, but his accent is a little curious, especially considering there are native speakers with the proper accent to make it a little distracting, but maybe non-native speakers won't mind that as much as I did.The movie is very pretty, with a nice soundtrack.

187,clejo-25695,Buckle up and go see it!,9,22 June 2017,"Having read nor seen reviews or trailers before watching, Brimstone came in at full force. Though it was at many times unpleasant to watch, I did feel I owed it to the women to see it through. And I am glad I did.Beautifully filmed, deeply haunting and indeed unsettling. But such was life (or rather: could life be) in times where the clergy were law and people feared them as much as they did hell (and therefore did not speak up). I strongly recommend offended viewers to look into our religious history and take note of the many offences and inhumanities women had to go through - and perhaps still go through, may it be in less open/public forms.There is somewhat of a trend in popular culture with exposing the mischiefs of church and clergymen. (In the Western genre, Sweetwater (2013) touches similar themes). But sometimes Christianity is merely used to give people insight in the similarities it has with other emerging (tentatively violent) religions, pointing out to us: we've been there and done that too. I understand that this notion is deeply uncomfortable for some.This story shows clearly however that the restrictions set by religion and the extremity of the measures used to maintain its level of control, always result in the opposite: sheer inhumanity and the pursuit of ones personal desires (albeit justified by bending the rules). From that point of view, Brimstone tells an important tale that should not be ignored without contemplation.Violence throughout the film was harsh, but very often suggested (such as rape) and not shown. This to me indicates that the filmmakers do respect women and merely wish to tell their story. As to the feminist undertone: though we do not feel it, the women do win in the end. Brave as captains who go down with their ship, taking control of their own life and afterlife, therewith objecting to and overruling both men and their silly scriptures.In short: buckle up and go see it!",Brimstone

This, of course, is nothing new. What I loved most about the film was the brutal nature of the old west. How your family tree could be wiped out instantly.

198,hugokeijzer,This is why we go to the movies.,10,3 January 2017,"Howard Hawks once said that a good movie is ""three good scene and no bad ones"". That would make Martin Koolhoven's Brimstone beyond good - great even. You know you're watching a masterpiece when not three, not five, but nearly every scene is a work of art. A powerful combination of character, conflict, beauty and above all truth. And Koolhoven's truth is in the details, the blocking of a scene, the poignant rendering of a back lit saddle creating a striking metaphor or even the empty gun pointed at an whore-abusing coal miner - helping him to climax by the very thought of violence. This is what makes cinema different from theater or television - its power to tell story through images and action rather than words. How fitting that the lead character has no tongue to speak with - but still manages to steal the show. Fanning and Pearce are true gems and shine bright in this dark epic. It's not a film for the faint-hearted or god-fearing - but I truly hope my generation will be able to appreciate a thing of beauty like this and not be disappointed at the absence of Tarantino-like crowd pleasers. This is not a self conscious meta western, but a real story about human's struggle with religion, violence and above all man's fear of women. Koolhoven has given us in the Netherlands something to be proud of again - Cinema with balls that confronts and provokes. I'm sure many people will be offended, disgusted - and so should they - the world is not as depicted in the Marvel universe, where no action has real consequences. In this time of populism and mass manipulation we need people like Martin Koolhoven who are willing to spend years perfecting their craft - creating fiction that reveals the truth our reality obscures. Go and see for yourself - Love it - Hate it - Ten years from now we'll still be talking about this film.",Brimstone

205,herman-kilk,False Advertising in IMDb & Most of Users,3,15 April 2017,"NB: THE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW ARE OF MINOR IMPORTANCE.As my headline says, I feel I was frauded into seeing this movie by its plot summary on this site and some user reviews glorifying it.The plot summary goes: ""A triumphant epic of survival and a tale of powerful womanhood and resistance against the unforgiving cruelty of a hell on earth. Our heroine is Liz (Dakota Fanning), carved from the beautiful wilderness, full of heart and grit, hunted by a vengeful Preacher (Guy Pearce) - a diabolical zealot and her twisted nemesis. But Liz is a genuine survivor; she's no victim - a woman of fearsome strength who responds with astonishing bravery to claim the better life she and her daughter deserve..."" User reviews go: ""Terrific"", ""Best movie of LFF this year"",""Dark, violent and depressing - wonderful"", ""Super powerful"", ""Simply amazing"", ""Original"" etc.I say this much is true that it is violent, dark and utterly depressing. All the characteristics I do not tend to have problem with - I love dark dramas and gory horror films. What I have a problem with is the lack of everything else. THERE IS NO TRIUMPH IN THIS STORY. IT DOES NOT EMPOWER WOMEN OR DEPICT THEM AS STRONG SURVIVORS. OUR MAIN CHARACTER (AS EVERY OTHER WOMAN THERE) IS A VICTIM. She continues to be a victim throughout all the bloody movie. She is no fighter but victim and escaper who lets everyone else die fighting for her or just because knowing her. This is two and a half hours long torture porn and eventual death of a villain in a completely unsatisfying manner does not make it triumphant.Showing the life of wild west from women's non-enviable pov was an admirable effort, but the overly powerful (semi-immortal???) villain, story that didn't know did it want to be harsh reality tale or dark mystic thriller, lack of power in every female character etc pulled it down into just some depressing tale that goes on and on and on and on and then suddenly ends without pulling the ends together.I suspect that it ticked the right boxes to get high votes: European writer/director, overall depressing feel, a story that is messy and full of holes so film hipsters can call it ""thought-provoking""... Yup, for aforementioned wannabes it is probably a good tone to praise the movie :P Cinematography was great. Also acting.",Brimstone

But when I read and saw that the movie was dark and it had a pretty decent cast, I became really interested. A week later I bought a ticket and I went to see Brimstone in the cinema.The movie Brimstone portrays a thrilling and dark story, but is has the very accurate characteristics of a western. When watching Brimstone it really felt like I was there in that place and that exact time of period, which is a very rare effect you don't often see or feel in a film. I've read many reviews saying that the brutality was too much. Personally, I found it beautiful. It makes you empathize with the characters in a way you don't often experience. It makes you feel like you are becoming the character. Yes, the movie is gruesome, but you must try to appreciate this.The way the whole story is told really appealed to me. The movie is divided into four chapters that show the 'what', the 'how', the 'why' and the 'Endgame'. Because of this way of storytelling, you can watch the movie without getting spoiled the vast amount of answers. It really gives the viewer the question marks why that event is happening and why the character is behaving that way. Because of this the film is not dragging. All chapters have their own tension that is being build up, and is later being released at the end of each episode which keeps the viewer sitting on the edge of the chair. Brimstone also contains a very good plot and a beautiful score. The movie is slow paced, but the viewer is not going to get bored.The acting overall was great in Brimstone. Especially Dakota Fanning (Liz) and Emilia Jones (Joanna). They both did an amazing job portraying the characters. Guy Pearce was superb with his portrayal of The Reverend. He really was the finishing touch of this movie.My congratulations go to Martin Koolhoven for his international film debut. What a cunning movie.",Brimstone

227,hypervoidal,What can you take from this,4,26 July 2020,"Brimstone is made of 4 chapters (yes with title screens and all) where all 8 people with actual character development die. I'll tag them along the way to make it easier:CHAPTER 1: girl hides a wounded cowboy and his partner in the family barn.
her mother hangs herself (1). the cowboy kills his partner. her dad kills the cowboy (2). then has sex with the girl (yes his daughter).CHAPTER 2: girl runs to a whorehouse. dad runs after her.
she makes a friend, that kills a guy then gets hanged (3). she makes another friend, but this one kills the whorehouse owner (4). then gets killed by the dad (5).CHAPTER 3: girl runs to a farm and gets married. dad runs after her.
then kills her husband (6).CHAPTER 4: girl runs to her father in law's house. dad runs after her.
then kills her son. and the father in law. but the girl kills dad (7). then kills herself (8).So this movie makes a setting, kills every single meaningful character in it (+ 80% of people surrounding them), and moves on to the next one. It does this 4 times, until there is no next one and you're left with zero connection with anything or anyone. If you like plots with message, stay away.But surrounding all of this you do get to see women getting tortured: Hit with belts, slapped, tongues cut off, gagged with iron masks, choked, full package. Also some dying animals (pigs, horses, sheep, you name it). Oh and dead babies, dead children, whipped children... director really hated kids. If that's your thing, highly recommended.",Brimstone

A lot of scenes involve violence towards children and animals that I think story could have been achieved without the visceral imagery. It takes a lot to make me look away from a movie but I found myself looking away a few times. There are also some parts that just don't factually add up which left me questioning things. For example, how exactly does someone cause a babies head to be too big? Why did she not try a C section (we have been preforming them for centuries) How does a horse go for days and days (it seems) without stopping? Where did the winter clothes come from if they ran away in the middle of the night? Wouldn't the metal have been too hot still? If you can forgot simple logic and just go with the story there is a macrabe brutalness to it. Guy Pearce is masterful in this movie. Rarely do I walk away from a movie and think if I saw that actor in real life right now, after watching that performance i would punch them, but I felt that with him.

A man, hell-bent on finding and torturing his daughter shows how compelled he is to complete his goal. Pushed to the brink of desperation, Liz/Joanna forfeits her old life/self and cuts out her own tongue in the hope she would be somewhat unrecognisable and create a new life.I also find the cutting out the tongue quite symbolic, after witnessing and enduring the many horrors of her upbringing, she possibly vowed never to speak of them? That if she survived to old age, that life would die with her? Physically, nothing stopped the reverend and nothing and nobody got in his way until he put Liz's/Joanna's daughter in danger. But be warned, do not mess with a mother and her child! A mother's bond with her child cannot be easily broken and I think that reflects in the film.Religion played a huge part, although always in the background, the dark side of convincing one's self of behaviour and attitude that allows them to essentially make up their own rules and do whatever they want, so long as they pray or pay penance (with self harm), with men being above all else and only answerable to 'God'.

239,arijit-sarbagna,Potential Thriller - Split too Thin,4,2 April 2017,"This movie was indeed meant to be a good movie - at least based on the story it wanted to pitch. At the beginning, it did create a suspense & tried to carry it through different chapters. But this attempt is where all ended. All the good acting goes in vain and the reverend character - being religiously blind & pedophile in nature makes things too disturbing to absorb.And that makes me think, who is the target audience for this movie? You definitely can't consider this to be a family movie. Is this really a mystery thriller? It showed glimpses of thrill but that got diluted with too much separation between chapters. Also too much focus on the gory details of torture & violence take the focus away at times. Additionally, the character of reverend - who was painted as a meticulous person, showed erratic behaviors in his steps - which don't add up.To summarize, I started watching this movie & gradually got en-thrilled by the mystery that was building up gradually. But then lost the link due to the intentional gaps created int the plot. I somehow managed to get past this. Actors did a great job - no denying! Dakota Fanning did great even with limited speech. Guy Pearce - did justice to his character (though the plot gave him undue advantage on multiple instances). But I wish the story-line & director was a bit more caring on the finesse to carry forward the thrill, than splitting it in too many pieces.",Brimstone

Most revenge Westerns have a couple of terrible scenes to set up the payoff, this one probably has a dozen. But don't take my word for it. If murder, self-mutilation, rape, sodomy, incest, torture, bondage, public humiliation, senseless cruelty and violence are your thing, this will be your Best Picture of the Year. I wished I was the favorite hog that gets slaughtered, at least it was put out of its misery before The Reverend turned his ""Sword of God"" on it.",Brimstone
241,iempje_female,Definitely not what it says on the label,2,28 February 2017,"I just got back from watching Brimstone and it made an impression, in fact I'm rather upset for wasting 2.5 hours and now having vivid flashbacks of sickening scenes. So, where to begin... First mistake that I could not believe had been made this day and age: a person with part of their tongue cut off cannot speak or make any vocal sounds...seriously?! *Unnecessary sign language ensues for dramatic effect*It was supposed to be a ""western, mystery, thriller"" which seemed interesting. Unfortunately the plot line on this site was the only mystery about this film. A thriller then? Not unless you find endless amounts of mostly pointless violence thrilling. I generally don't mind violence when it serves a purpose to the story, as the here imitated Tarantino is such a master of. There is so much of it and so graphic that it's shocking (as probably intended) at first, but not that much further down the line you just shut off and wish this pile of misery ends quickly... which it doesn't. It seems endless. The story is simple and could easily have been told in 1.5 hours, so why did it have to be so ff-in long?! If I had to describe the genre: drama, with western and horror elements. The variety of violence was the only surprising thing about this film, just when you wonder whether this or that kind of torture will be graphically portrayed it's provided. #spoiler# There's no subtlety or nuance to be found anywhere. I find the characters over the top, the story line boring, motives and background story lacking and no real sense of purpose with the time-line mix-up and unnecessary scenes. The moment she sees the reverend you know it's going to end with her killing him - by the by, how did he get himself into that position and how on earth does he keep finding her?! Nothing makes sense-. The anti climax of our main character FINALLY setting fire to- and shooting the baddie is only worsened by her anticlimactic death soon after: this film's final lash to the viewers raw back. No sense of the promised sweet revenge or a sense of well earned peace after a lifetime of misery. No. Just our heroine giving up after some douchebags come to claim her because ""her past has run up with her"". This film will leave you feeling abused; don't watch it. If you're looking to feel sad at the end of a gripping drama with a feminist message and star cast, go see Million Dollar Baby. If you want violence, blood and gore with a great cast, story line and wittiness, go watch a recent Tarantino.",Brimstone

Especially because of some bad reviews below which I don't agree. You know Brimstone is a cruel film and anti women. It takes place in a time when women means very little towards men. So if you don't like this, you should not see this movie. The movie is divided in 4 periods in time. After each period you know more about the characters. Every period contains a lot of violence and is most of the time very anguished. The actors are really great, especially Pearce and Fanning, and how the movie is filmed is also special. For example the angles from above.There is a lot of violence in the movie and I really could not see some scenes but it is a movie where you think about for a long time. Really impressive, I only know a few movies that give you this strange feeling after the movie. You have different emotions. Even though the movie is a bit slow this is not disturbing.

My biggest issue with long movies, over two hours, is that I start to wander off if its not really exciting, and I definitely did watching this movie. The story line isn't that good and unique to keep you hooked and there is to much difference in acting (performance wise). Some actors play there roles better than others and by the way this movie is constructed it leads to a kinda bumpy ride. Different chapters in this movie don't continue smoothly and that contributes to the feeling of a long sit. On top of that there are some scenes that don't seem to be necessary to create a good story and only make the movie feel even longer. Don't get me wrong, this movie isn't horrible, parts of this movie are really good, and although there are some really bad parts it still tells you a nice story. Its just the noticeable long sit that makes this movie not stand out from the rest and sometimes a bit boring.",Brimstone

251,josh72,Don't blame the actors,3,14 October 2016,"Have just seen this at the London Film Festival. I was looking forward to it a great deal because I like films about this era and the cast were all actors that I like. Unfortunately this film misses the mark completely. It contains a lot very graphic, unflinching, gory violence. So much so that by the end of the film I was somewhat desensitized to it. In one scene a character is disemboweled and has his intestines wrapped around his neck.. I don't have a problem with violence and gore per se but in this film it felt like horror movie gore had invaded (and detracted from) a film trying to be a serious drama/thriller. A fair bit of the violence depicted is towards various child characters but, without any accompanying gravitas, these scenes just felt awkward and unnecessary. The film tells the story of the relationship between a sadistic preacher (Guy Pearce) and his step-daughter (Dakota Fanning). She spends most of her life trying to escape him but he always catches up with her and punishes her (for not agreeing to be his wife after her mother commits suicide). The film is basically an account of the many different ways in which he punishes her; beatings, rape, psychological abuse, murder of her loved ones etc. The film takes rather a long time to reach it's very predictable conclusion; she eventually kills him. I do not like this film but I lay blame for that entirely on the director. The actors all put in a good turn and do what is asked of them. But the film is very unimaginative and predictable. Completely without any subtleties or nuances. By the end of the film I felt as bludgeoned, lashed and beaten as some of the characters.",Brimstone

It doesn't really matter if it is sad or happy, the important thing is that for a couple of hours, your mind is completely immersed in the story, because in the end, that is the reason why we watch movies, to get entertained and distracted from our routines.And that is exactly what happens with this movie. Even though it is quite long (almost three hours long), I was never worried about how much time was left. The story of the main character (Liz), is so intense, that I could not take my eyes off the screen. I am a big fan of flashbacks, and in this movie this technic is wisely used. It starts showing how Liz is uncomfortable and frightened by the new reverend's presence in town, which gets your attention and makes you want to know what the hell happen between those two. That is when the movie starts going backwards and showing us what happened to Liz before arriving to that town, but always leaving the original issue with the reverend behind. Therefore, the viewer is expectant the whole movie, awaiting to know what caused the conflict between them.Moreover, the western landscapes are beautifully shot, transmitting the cold and isolation of those towns.In conclusion, Brimstone is an absolutely masterpiece, which definitely should have been part of the Oscars nominees!",Brimstone

Just completely and brazenly stupid and unbelievable. The constant infliction of pain and suffering on countless people in this flick who cold easily have escaped same, or ended their repression.

276,chk-98562,Feminist horror fantasy masked in realism,6,11 May 2017,"6/10 This film has the trappings a good film - excellent cinematography, acting and score. However, the film frustrates the viewer early on by venturing from its promising beginning as a drama headlong into horror, and sacrificing its well earned realism by portraying the preacher as an overpowered super villain, rather than a believable antagonist rooted in the world of the main character. The film has been hailed by some as victorious or feminist. Unfortunately, the film does itself a disservice by become a sermon, but one without any message of redemption. Many have rightly pointed out, that the male characters are all incredibly evil or, in case of the few exceptions, completely ineffectual. Similarly, most of the female characters are either passive or victimized continuously without ever being able to fully escape or defeat their oppressors until the very end of the film. The film is riddled with plot holes that are frustrating to the viewer that wants the protagonist not to suffer needlessly (after 2.5 hours of it you start to become desensitized), but seem to be designed to further the directors purpose of: 1. casting men and puritanical Christians as evil 2. Sabotage any the female characters' ability to avoid harm so that they can be further victimized by the puritanical and evil men. For instance, why does Liz not tell her husband that the preacher is clearly the one terrorizing them, let alone expose his past of torture and rape? It's as if this is not even considered an option, and yet all the while the only two good men in the story (the husband and the son) die without ever being able to call for help from the other townsfolk, who know them much better than they know the preacher. Other plot holes jump in my mind - how did the preacher survive having his throat slit and being unconscious after blood loss, seconds from burning alive in a house where the only other man had just been murdered and would therefore be unable to assist carrying him out alive? Why did the wife kill herself, when she knew that the husband wanted to rape her daughter, who would be more vulnerable without her protection? Was that bravery? Why did Liz kill herself, when she could have simply gotten anybody that knew her from her childhood or from her time at the whorehouse - think how many people she worked with or even serviced intimately that could have identified her? She gave up, despite having fought tooth and nail to save herself and her daughter, and now, being presumably wealthy enough to pay for a lawyer. I believe its not uncommon for a bounty to require the return of a suspected criminal to the county in question before having a trial, where the townsfolk would recognize her as someone they knew for years and not the perpetrator. Was it really necessary for her to cut out her tongue? It's not like the husband specifically preferred a silent spouse. After meeting the pretty young, not deformed former prostitute, I think it goes without saying that he's not so picky that he would refuse her, given that the other fiancé was now dead. Instead we get plot service that ultimately is designed to sabotage Liz's happiness once again at the very end of the movie. It's not men torturing the women in the movie, its just one man: the director. And meanwhile you can tell he's flagellating himself over his own cultural guilt, just like the reverend did after terrorizing his wife to the point of suicide. Last plot hole that comes to mind: How did the Reverend sneak into the house without Liz knowing at the end of the film, and silently murder the Grandpa who presumably was standing by the daughter's bed without making a sound, and without any clear access into the house? Why was there a pistol in the basement when the Grandpa was unarmed? Why did he say that he should be holding 'the gun' when he had at least one pistol. Frankly, she brought her own rifle, so realistically he would have a rifle as well, given that it was customary and he had rifle shells in the house. Again, plot holes designed to sabotage the well being of the main character in this sadistic film. This film amounted to a horror fantasy intending to convey the most negative possible warning of religious dogma - of Christianity, specifically - and of the dreaded patriarchy. I think to some it will seem victorious because they believe that these are the most toxic elements of the West. I think the film is a few beats too late, is not shocking in its message whatsoever, because it is walking down a well tread path. I feel like this film was made partly in reaction to the Christian fundamentalist mass shooting in Norway that killed 77 people. I'm personally happy to explore themes of toxic fundamentalism, Christian or otherwise, but when the message overpowers the film, it becomes problematic. The interpretation of Christianity and the role of women in society at the time seem to be as warped and unrealistic as the arguably superhuman reverend. In his ultimate death scene, he does not even flinch when his entire body is engulfed in flame for several seconds, before being blasted sensationally out the window. This is a not a realistic portrayal of a preacher, a bad guy, or what would have happened if the events of this movie unfolded in real life. A plot that stuck to reality, would have been superior and actually worth something. This movie in it's totality, I would say is ultimately worthless.",Brimstone

While these three stories are very muscular, Brimstone's leading characters are female and the film even has a feminist message. Because stories like the ones mentioned before are violent, some people will have a problem with this. But in the end, Brimstone seems to show the world as it probably was and maybe even still is in some parts. Impressive writing, acting and film making skills.",Brimstone

The story was well- constructed, the themes were relevant and compelling and the acting was extraordinary, especially the reverent and Dakota Fanning (saw her in American pastoral too the other day, she is a force to be reckoned with in the acting world). So yes, this is a good movie.But would I recommend watching it to any of my friends or family? No, probably not, because although it was a good movie it made me feel horrible afterwards (as in crying in the bathroom horrible), and this is coming from someone who has seen her fair share of horrors and thrillers throughout the years. I don't know why, but there was something so incredibly heart-wrenching about this movie for me that i have barely slept last night. It was not because of the graphic violence per se, although it didn't help of course, but just because of the atmosphere created throughout the movie.So if you are planning on watching keep in mind that it is not for the faint-hearted (I feel like Albus Dumbledore warning about the Triwizard tournament lol)",Brimstone
280,martdejager,A dark epic of survival that depicts the dark side of not only religion but the wild west itself,9,17 January 2017,"This is one of the very few movies that managed to shock me, and i have seen allot of crazy things in my life.The story in short: From the moment The new reverend climbs pulpit, Liz knows she, and here whole family are grave danger. Following Liz in her struggle to escape from the man that haunts her, we also witness her past that will reveal as to why this man is following her without mercy.What i thought of the movie: (Note:I am in no way a movie reviewer (or a reviewer at all). i thought it was a great movie with really solid performance form the entire cast (though Kits American accent wasn't really that great), the way Dakota and Guy presented the relation between they'r characters really made movie feel tense since it is obvious from the start that there is something more going on between them (The moment Liz sees the Reverend you know there is something more going on). The way they divided the movie in 4 chapters was a good choice in my opinion since it gives them a good way to make time jumps (each chapter tells a part of Liz her struggle against the Reverend). The movie is VERY slow paced, the first 2 chapters really take they'r time and only from about half of chapter 3 the movie increases its pace. But i like this a ton (allot of people will disagree), it really gives you the feeling that this is something that Liz deals with since child hood.The way this movie represents religion, female oppression, and heritage is really beautiful but shocking at the same time. It really shows how someone's interpretation of the bible in this case, can make them just straight up nut cases, while they think that they are just doing gods will. Also the way they show how women were abused and really just seen as tools, be that for the pleasure of outlaws etc or the hard working women in Christian family's is great. It also show that your heritage doesn't have to define who you are, even though raised in a very strict Christian family Liz just does not want to be part of that kind of world. And here struggle as to be free of that is just amazing to witness,Now, this movie is not for the faint of heart, There is child chastising, Murder, execution, (almost child rape), although we have seen murder and execution before, the tone of the movie and way it shows really makes it sickening, and the fact that those kind of things really did happen at that time really makes it feel authentic, also in the way that actions don't come without consequences. In short, i really think people need to see this movie, not just for enjoyment. but also as food for thought, since it really is a thought provoking movie. at least for me.",Brimstone

290,roxanne-27309,The hype is better than the film,5,4 April 2017,"I really wanted to like this film, and watched it because some of my favorite actors were in it. As far as the acting is concerned, everyone's performance was stellar. It's too bad that the actors didn't have a better story and plot to work with. The cinematography was really great but, the director needs to stick to film-making and let someone else do the writing. There were way too many reality discrepancies in the plot, and it was long and drawn out unnecessarily. There was also way too much gratuitous violence. As someone who has seen all the good western movies ever made, in my opinion this is not even a true western movie. In the true old west 150 plus years ago, the villain would have never lived long enough to continue on his sick rampage. The congregation would have seen him for what he was, and put him out of his misery. The ultra religious of the time were not stupid enough to follow the villain in the story past his obvious signs of blasphemy and lunacy. The women in the film are not depicted as strong, they are depicted as weak and helpless. That is quite the opposite of the description of the film. There are other reality discrepancies besides what I've mentioned, but I won't list them here for the sake of brevity.I rated the film 5 stars for the great acting and cinematography, but I was really frustrated and disappointed with the plot and writing. Sadly, I would not recommend the film to most of the people I know.",Brimstone
291,arnovprive,True life,9,4 April 2017,"Yes, also I was horrified at times (hence the 9) as we are horrified of some events in real life today. We have to admit that the time of the movie's setting was lawless. Like most new world discoveries. You had to be extremely tough to survive. It is my opinion Koolhoven has succeeded showing us simply that extreme way of survival including all its religious hocus pocus.",Brimstone
292,ricardoruizarq,No sense,2,5 April 2017,"It starts really well and keep your attention to the story. Actors did a good job. But in the end there's no story. whats the point in making all that drama and does not link everything whit a good ending? Bad crap end!this story had so much potential, but its all it got. I just don't get it how people can rate this a 7 movie.",Brimstone
293,adam-14945,Not worth the time,1,11 April 2017,"This is only the 2nd movie I have had to stop watching in 50yrs! By the end of the movie, you cannot wait to kill the preacher yourself!! I am sure that this sort of thing still happens today, but having to watch it makes me mad! It's 2.5hrs I will not soon forget!I should have chosen a better movie to watch!",Brimstone

295,kandbharmon,Quite violent,5,13 April 2017,"Great story, but unfortunately there is a ""however."" The order in which the events were presented made it difficult for me to follow. Maybe it's me, but having seen other movies that went back and forth between decades with out much trouble, it was annoying. I was also a bit put off by the violence, graphic and implied. It may be for some but not for me. I simply don't want to be exhausted trying to watch a movie.",Brimstone
296,kimber-18550,What a miserable experience,1,24 April 2017,"If you want a movie that stars out with a dreadful situation and just continues on until after all the torture you are left with a crappy ending then this is the movie for you. I feel like I wasted my time knowing about a third of the way through this movie it was going to have a unhappy ending and leave you feeling shitty but I was hopeful. I was wrong, felt shitty through out the entire movie.",Brimstone
297,ashtenlbailey,"Horrid to watch, unless you hate women.",1,29 April 2017,"After watching this movie, I can only conclude that whomever created and green lit this movie hates women. I know some will disagree, but it was terribly brutal, hard to watch, and I literally had to watch something lighthearted as a mental cleanse after watching it.And last, for anyone to say that the main character is not a ""victim"" ignores the fact that she was repeatedly raped and sold throughout the movie. She was strong, but the sadistic underpinnings of this movie need to be called exactly what they are.",Brimstone
298,adamjrawlings,A nasty piece of work,2,17 May 2020,"It's far too long at near 150 minutes considering the lack of a strong enough plot, and it is generally unsavoury as a watch. I think the director is taking too much pleasure in the covering of the relentless & highly unpleasant subject matter. The characters aren't interesting enough and are not developed sufficiently. The main villain is one-dimensional, and though well-shot it never really goes anywhere that will engage you, leaving you as the movie progresses to 'endure' it rather than enjoy it. For a vastly superior film in all respects with similar themes, try The Salvation which came out one or two years earlier.",Brimstone
299,tindy-00566,Great cast but terrible writing,1,19 May 2017,"This was an uninteresting, boring movie with an unattractive story- line. Writing is not convincing, characters are not logical and plot is awkward. Way too long. There was a shameless cameo. Overall the cast was great as was the cinematography but the writing was terrible with implausible and illogical plot twists throughout. Let the whole movie down.",Brimstone
300,islandparty,Dv,8,20 May 2017,"At times, this movie was hard to stomach, however this movie depicts thereality of modern day life, but in a more dramatic fashion.I view this movie as a depiction of domestic violence, with the reverend depicting a pit-bull kind of abuser, the kind of abuser that wont let you go if you leave, that will hunt you and your children until full control is won.Great movie",Brimstone
301,tylerrstevens,This was a really good movie undeserving of the low ratings,9,27 May 2017,"I passed on this movie because of the low ratings, the first time I saw it for rent. The descriptions of the movie made it seem horrible and depraved. Yes they implied things, but not anything like the reviews made it out to be! It was a great movie, very good performances and I'm glad I decided to rent it in the end. Don't miss out!",Brimstone
302,tsuminine,Horrible,1,15 June 2017,"This movie is horrible, 2hours of my life wasted, I'm not talking about the actors because i think they're good. But the script, oh my god. I wonder what is wrong with the sick people who reviewed this movie as Amazing. The director must be perturbed or sick or very depressed. If you want a movie that: -Everything's goes wrong -You feel sick and depressed. -Leaves you devastated -Dont have a purpose or a lesson to learn -it's nauseating.Go ahead, if you like this movie please seek for help immediately.",Brimstone
303,rayraky,Rubbish movie,1,1 July 2017,"Terrible movie. Rubbish. Unrealistic. The main character was killed but somehow he survived. How, nobody knows. I am dutch, so i should be proud but instead i am ashamed. What a bullshit that i need to write 5 lines. This film does not decerve 5 lines. No action. What more do you want me to say.",Brimstone

305,masoncwellsactor,This movie is awsome!,10,28 December 2017,"Watched it several times story is great and it keep you wonder till the end.
A triumphant epic of survival and a tale of powerful womanhood and resistance against the unforgiving cruelty of a hell on earth. Our heroine is Liz (Dakota Fanning), carved from the beautiful wilderness, full of heart and grit, hunted by a vengeful Preacher (Guy Pearce) - a diabolical zealot and her twisted nemesis. But Liz is a genuine survivor; she's no victim - a woman of fearsome strength who responds with astonishing bravery to claim the better life she and her daughter deserve. Fear not. Retribution is coming.",Brimstone
306,cheever-95482,A Reflection Of The Industry's Accepted Abuse!,1,24 November 2017,"Spoiler Alert: Really?? What this movie proved to me is that this present society, within and outside the movie industry have not learned a single thing from our history or present day news. Why else would free women and civilized men praise a movie about a little girl and woman being sexually abused, beaten, and silenced. Why would anyone call this ""Art""! The main character lives in fear and runs from her evil abuser. Yet, She never warns a single soul about who he is and what he is capable of doing, even to those she loves dearly. The viewer is tricked, played by the reversal of the order of events, not through flashbacks! But by the mixed-up chapters. The people in the church never ask a single question or even look shocked from the actions of the self proclaimed GOD/leader even when the evidence of his EVIL is right in front of them. Sound a little like the recent news? I sat through it hoping the protagonist would do something, anything unpredictable. Instead, I watched her continue on as the never ending victim for years on end. So at last I became a victim to a movie lacking any creativity, lesson, or beauty. I'm sure the perverted producers, directors, actors, politicians and masked men out there found it extremely appealing though, because it is so sickeningly brutal in it's perverted and violent detail. Child abuse and sexual harassment won't stop until we stop accepting and paying to watch their explicit child abuse in their movies!",Brimstone

308,shawnth-04161,Very Tragic! *WARNING SPOILERS*,10,6 January 2018,"This movie was very sad wrenching and heart pumping. I like the way they jumped around to different pivotal moments in her life and the way they did the movie out of sequence somehow it brought everything full circle and everything made sense at the end. Very creative movie and Dakota Fanning killed this role. She proved she's not just the child actress. How ever this movie is an after the children go to bed movie it is very graphic with an extreme amount of adult language. It broke my heart at the end. She finally got free from her preacher dad just to be arrested for a murder that the real Liz committed right before she died and Joanna stole her identity. She is executed at the end. So no matter how much she struggled and all tha she went through She is killed for a crime she didn't even commit. I love this movie, I would recommend this movie to anyone except children lol. I gave it 10 Stars for the reason being that it was very creative and very good film.",Brimstone

I don't understand the current rating 7,1 or something, I almost didn't watch the movie. I am glad I did, I think this movie deserves a far better rating. The movie has a story (refreshing) and I love how it is pieced together. It has some violent scenes but, if you have the stomach for example the movie seven, the scenes will not upset you. One of the best in a while.",Brimstone
