0,MartinHafer,"Very good,...but a tad overrated",8,6 March 2007,"Okay, it's odd that I would give a film a score of 8 and still say it's overrated. That's because as of the time I wrote this review, this film was #203 on the IMDb Top 250--and this just seems too high a rating. Part of it is because there are many better Film Noir movies that didn't make the list and because the plot, at times, is awfully convoluted. It earns it's 8 more because of the film's excellent style and snappy Noir dialog. In many ways, it reminds me of the excellent Bogart film, THE BIG SLEEP, because they both have plot problems BUT still are excellent films to watch.Now as I said already, the dialog was great and Robert Mitchum is a great Noir actor. He is big, tough, kind of ugly and not 100% good or evil--the perfect Noir hero. And in support, you've got quite a few similar characters--except that they ARE 100% evil! In true Noir fashion, the other ""unsung"" supporting actors were the sets and camera angles and music that really set the mood. Director Jacques Tourneur did a great job of setting the mood--just like he did in his famous collaborations with producer Val Lewton.So give the movie a try, but also try to see some other Noir gangster films from the era that are also great films but somehow have gone unnoticed, such as T-MEN, THE KILLERS, DOA, BOB Le FLAMBEUR, KISS OF DEATH, ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW, WHITE HEAT, THE RACKET and THE NARROW MARGIN and many, many more.",Out of the Past
1,TheLittleSongbird,Defines the term quintessential film noir,10,9 June 2010,"What a movie. If I had to give away the term quintessential film noir to any film noir, Out of the Past could very well be it. The plot is complicated yet it is very engrossing, with plenty of effective scenes, especially that unforgettable ending. It is gorgeously shot, exceptionally directed, adeptly scripted and atmospherically scored, these are reasons enough to watch this film. But I can't write this review without praising the acting. Robert Mitchum is memorably languid as the ultra-hard-boiled former private detective, while Jane Greer is dangerously beautiful as the cold yet equally beautiful femme-fatale. Kirk Douglas is also brilliant as the soft-spoken yet truly Machiavellian gangster. Overall, Out of The Past is quite simply quintessential film noir. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Out of the Past
2,bkoganbing,The Scope of Her Evil,9,27 November 2006,"Out of the Past came at a time for Robert Mitchum after one of the worst films in his career, Desire Me which he did on a loan out to MGM. He must have been grateful to get back to RKO studios and to do one of the best noir films ever done.Mitchum plays the luckless Jeff Bailey, private eye who has the ill fortune to fall under the feminine charms of Jane Greer after gambler/racketeer Kirk Douglas hires him to find her and $40,000.00 she stole from him after shooting him. Mitchum trails her to Mexico, but when he meets her, let's just say he easily sees why Kirk Douglas wants her back so bad. It's one piece of intrigue after another at this point until there's tragedy all around.This was Kirk Douglas's second picture and he showed his range as a player after playing a weakling in his debut film, The Strange Loves of Martha Ivers. Douglas and Mitchum got good notices, but this film really belongs to Jane Greer. The sheer scope of this woman's evil will leave you gasping. Out of the Past gave Jane Greer her career role and she made the most of it. Two of post World War II Hollywood's biggest leading men and several others in tow. It's breathtaking when you think of it.Out of the Past is a real downer of a film, but mesmerizing as a study of how a man can get hooked on feminine charms applied right.",Out of the Past
3,Leofwine_draca,One of the most ruthless femme fatales ever,6,13 July 2015,"A solid film noir starring the inimitable Robert Mitchum as a small-time hood who's given up his crime career and now makes a living pumping gas! Unfortunately for him, his past is about to catch up with him in the form of a debt owed to Kirk Douglas's nasty gangster. Douglas's mistress, Kathie, absconded with $40,000 and Douglas wants it back, so he employs Mitchum to track the woman down.Unfortunately, Kathie is a classic femme fatale - played with full-scale conniving relish by Jane Greer - and Mitchum soon finds himself falling for her ample charms. What follows then is a ride of betrayal, murder, and of course death, all ably filmed by the great Jacques Tourneur (NIGHT OF THE DEMON). Much of the fun in BUILD MY GALLOWS HIGH comes from the contrast between Douglas's youthful evil and Mitchum's laid back laconic style, and there are the requisite plot elements to enjoy here: sudden character betrayals, bursts of shocking violence, a memorable ending, and lots of smouldering tension.",Out of the Past
4,SnoopyStyle,flashback structure takes the sting out of a nasty noir,7,7 September 2014,"Joe Stefanos comes to small town of Bridgeport, California to look for Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) who's been laying low as a gas station owner. He decides to tell his girl Ann Miller (Virginia Huston) about his past. His real name is Jeff Markham. Three years ago, he and his partner Jack Fischer were private detectives hired by gangster Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas) to find Kathy Moffat (Jane Greer). She stole $40k and took off to Acapulco. In Mexico, he falls for her. She tells him that she doesn't have the money and they go to live together in San Fransico. Whit continues to look for her. Fischer runs into them and tries to blackmail them. Kathy shoots him and drives off with the $40k.The first half of the movie is a flashback with a completely different dame. It diffuses some of the tension. Actually the flashback by itself could have made a very interesting straight forward film noir. It would have been better if there is more action, more sex, and more brutality. No matter what, it's great to see Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas together.",Out of the Past
5,Hitchcoc,He Could Us a New Coat,8,22 February 2021,"This is classic Noir with Mitchum finding it impossible to make up for his associations in the past. Once Kirk Douglas got his paws into him, he had no defenses. Happy running a service station in a little town, the gangsters find him and use him. This has one of the most evil female characters of all time and our guy can't separate his love for her from her nasty actions. It also has the classic Film Noir conclusion when the hero gets backed into a corner.",Out of the Past
6,Prismark10,Find the lady not run away with her,7,8 June 2014,"Also known as Build my Gallows High which is the name of the source novel. This hard edged film noir with a slightly complicated plot with good use of light, camera shots a delicious femme fatale with no morals (Jane Greer.) In fact the film has another femme fatale that pops up briefly halfway through and a young Kirk Douglas playing a charming yet steely villain.Robert Mitchum plays a garage/petrol pump owner in a small town when he is clocked by an old face from the past. We learn that he used to be a private eye and he did a job for Kirk Douglas, a gambler and hoodlum to find the beautiful lady that shot him and ran off with some of his money.Mitchum finds her in Mexico and then falls in love with her and they both go into hiding only for some time later Mitchum's business partner to clock him.Now some years later he has been found again and told by Douglas to go to San Francisco to retrieve some papers. Mitchum also finds that Greer is back with Douglas. Mitchum reckons that he is likely to be framed and the cat and mouse games begin with people double crossing each other.Mitchum plays it cool, you can see why the film studios saw him as the next Bogarde. He is physically big and not a man to be messed around with but he can also play tender and romantic. This is an early example of what a talent he was.Also in an early role is an actor that would also go on to become a cinema great. Douglas is clearly having a ball as the sinister, smiling villain using everyone around him but a beautiful dame is his one weakness.Maybe the film was a little too contrived, could had done to be slightly tighter and yet with Mitchum as an innocent the ending does not sit well. Well thats the Hayes Code for you.",Out of the Past
7,mark.waltz,"Is he really bad, or did she make him that way?",9,16 April 2014,"Living in a small town makes the quietly macho Robert Mitchum seem squeezed in to where he doesn't quite fit in. Even dating the sweetest girl in town (Rhonda Fleming) is a tough factor to take. But when he is given the opportunity to go to Mexico to search for the missing girlfriend of an old pal (Kirk Douglas), Mitchum is outa there. This quietly sleepy Mexican village has Mitchum just as bored, until she walks in. She's Jane Greer, one of the most unforgettable vixens in film noir, and she plays so hard to get that you know it will be only a matter of time before the chaser is caught by the chasee. Stanwyck....Hayward....Tierney...Trevor...Savage....Bennett....Lake ....Scott....Mayo. These are the last names of some of the phenomenal actresses who have entered the legendary list of femme fatals in one of the most studied of all movie formulas. The mid-late 1940's brought the darkness of human nature out into the open, and women, who had gained independence while the men were away fighting, represented a sex which was determined to keep that newly found freedom and not return to the sweet little housewife that they had been before. Bad girls had always existed in movies, even ones who killed. But this new breed had a confidence they hadn't known before. Jane Greer's Kathie combines sultry femininity with sociopathic danger, and like many other women in these films, wasn't afraid of risking it all to commit murder, not even her soul.There is no way to pick what the best film noir is, but this certainly must be somewhere in the top 20, at least. Every element of this film is intriguing and dark, from the moment Mitchum begins to tell Fleming the story of how he became involved with Greer in the first place to the final fade-out where Fleming tries to grasp everything that has happened. How does a woman come to the point of such evil where human life, so usually valued by the women who create it, becomes dispensable like an old purse? Greer has no qualms about watching Mitchum defending them both with one of Douglas's cronies then after a few minutes end it with the pulling of a trigger. She's a bit sadomasochistic in that sense, and that makes her fun to watch.Questions arise from other characters in this film to indicate that Mitchum's character is no good. He was pulled out of an obvious dull existence, pretty much forgot about it when finding the most exciting life he could away from the countryside, so it is difficult to return back to it. Fleming and the others in the small town (which includes a very handsome Dickie Moore playing a deaf and dumb observer to Mitchum's destructive acts) can't imagine Mitchum's change thanks to a woman like Greer, so in a sense, this is about more than just the story. It is about character and how sin can seem intriguing and even justifiable. There are lots of questions left when the film concludes with a shocking finale, which is perhaps what the writer intended. The study of humanity on film finally gets a reality check thanks to changes in the world we didn't see coming before the war began that truly slapped us in the face once it ended.",Out of the Past
8,claudio_carvalho,Caught up by the Past,8,12 April 2008,"In a small town in California, the mysterious Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) owns a small gas station and is in love with the local Ann (Virginia Huston). When a stranger just arrived in town meets him, Jeff is ordered to travel to meet the powerful criminal Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas). Before traveling, Jeff calls Ann and tells her the story of his life, when he was a private eyes hired by Whit for US$ 5,000.00 to find his former mistress Kathie (Jane Greer) that had shot Whit and stolen US$ 40,000.00. The competent Jeff finds Kathie in Acapulco, but she tells that she had not taken Whit's money and they fall in love for each other and escape from Whit. When the former partner of Jeff, Fisher (Steve Brodie), finds the couple living in an isolated cabin, Kathie kills him and Jeff buries his corpse. Jeff accidentally finds the receipt of deposit of the amount in Kathie's purse and leaves her forever. When Jeff meets Whit, he surprisingly finds Kathie living with him; Whit asks Jeff one last job to get even and release Jeff from his debt. But Jeff finds that Whit is actually framing him.""Out of the Past"" is an excellent film-noir, with a melancholic story and a magnificent and amoral female fatal. The direction of Jacques Tourneur is outstanding and the cinematography is very beautiful. Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer have top-notch performances, showing great chemistry. However, the fantastic screenplay is certainly the best in this movie, disclosing a complex plot with the use of flashback and great lines. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Fuga do Passado"" (""Escape from the Past"")",Out of the Past
9,kosmasp,Don't make them like they used to,9,12 August 2013,"The movie played as a retrospective at the International Film Festvial in Berlin this year. A movie that can be considered a classic I reckon, but that I never got a chance of watching up to that point. The acting is great and the story moves along very nicely. The dialog is fast and funny as you might have seen and heard from other movies of that era and/or genre that is.There are some nice twists and turns in the story that make it a great watch. I won't reveal anything about the story of course, but if you like film noir, detective movies and a movie that is tension filled from beginning to the end, this is for you. You shouldn't mind that it's only in black & white either.",Out of the Past
10,classicsoncall,"""A dame with a rod is like a guy with a knitting needle"".",9,8 February 2013,"Except for a few minor quibbles which I'll get to, this is one fine example of noir that in a lot of respects sets the standard for the genre. Particularly mesmerizing is Jane Greer as the scheming Kathie Moffat, who by the end of the story, if you don't want to see her get what she's got coming, you just haven't paid enough attention. Complementing her effort is the always reliable Robert Mitchum, who basically has a solid citizen past, but gets caught up in the machinations of big time gambler Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas) who gets to tell his henchmen when to jump and how high.What really impressed me here was the clever dialog throughout, with about the best one liners this side of ""The Maltese Falcon"". The one in my summary is pretty classy, but now that I think about it, didn't really apply to Greer's character, because she proved herself fairly competent with a handgun, going two for two (three if you want to count Mitchum at the finale) in the marksmanship area. I also liked the one from Sterling about his boy Stephanos (Paul Valentine), stating he couldn't find a prayer in the Bible. I'd love to come up with stuff like that on my own.Anyway, about those quibbles I mentioned. When Markham (Mitchum) locates the briefcase in Baylord's (John Kellogg) office, he never looks to make sure the tax documents are still inside. A minor point I know, but it's something I would have done, so that's why I bring it up. Then you've got Joe Stephanos going over the side of that cliff because of The Kid's (Dickie Moore) accurate casting. But the sheer physics involved with the length of line and Stephanos' hefty physique didn't make that scene very credible to me. Interesting and ironic sure, but not credible.The kicker in all of this if you're rooting for Mitchum's character is that he doesn't make it to the end of the story. I wanted to see good old Kathie take her lumps, but felt pretty good about Markham/Bailey coming through with a check in the win column. Not only not so, but The Kid had to shake his head the wrong way to crush Markham's new gal (Virginia Huston). I know why he did it, but that was one tough sayonara. I guess that's why they call it noir.",Out of the Past

Now he must return to the big city world of danger, corruption, double crosses and duplicitous dames.What can you say? This is film noir the way it should be done: a private eye, a dame, some crime, and Robert Mitchum. Maybe the role was meant for Humphrey Bogart, but Mitchum is the best. Add on Kirk Douglas and director Jacques Tourneur, and you have a winner.Strangely, today (2015) Tourneur's best-remembered films are the ones he made with Val Lewton, which tended to be 1940s horror stories. This should be on that list, too, and it should be on any number of critics' best of lists.",Out of the Past
12,lee_eisenberg,"you wouldn't think that noir could take place in northern California, but it can",10,25 April 2017,"A common theme in cinema is a person whose past comes back to haunt him/her. Even if you've seen a number of these, you can't afford to miss Jacques Tourneur's ""Out of the Past"". When you start it, you might be confused to see the setting in northern California. However, there's a lot in store. Robert Mitchum's gas station owner gets forced to confront gangsters, femme fatales, and corruption when it gets revealed that he's not who he says he is. There's a lot in store here.I don't know if I would call ""Out of the Past"" the best film noir ever - I haven't seen that many - but it's got everything that makes a movie great. I found Jane Greer's amoral lover of Kirk Douglas's slimy businessman to be the most interesting character. We pretty much assume that the men are going to be hard-boiled, but the women also have their own tough sides.The photography isn't as stylized as we're used to in this genre, but the plot and characters more than make up for that. The ending is a shock, but it's understood that this was the only possible outcome.An undeniable classic.",Out of the Past
13,jboothmillard,Build My Gallows High,6,28 January 2008,"I would have to see again and pay a lot more attention than I think I did, especially to understand why the critics give it five out of five, but what I can remember was pretty good, from director Jacques Tourneur (Cat People). Basically Jeff Bailey, aka Jeff Markham (Robert Mitchum) has his past come back to him when he is ordered to see gambler Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas). On his way there, he tells his girlfriend Ann Miller (Virginia Huston) his story, and obviously a flashback shows this. Jeff was once a private eye hired by Sterling to spy on his mistress Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer), who shot Whit and got away with $40,000. He finds her in Acapulco, and she (being delectable) makes him forget about Sterling, and they have a bit of a passion for each other. Back to the present, Whit's new job for Jeff is a trap, but he is cautious. Also Rhonda Fleming as Meta Carson, Richard Webb as Jim 'Jimmy', Steve Brodie as Jack Fisher, Paul Valentine as Joe Stephanos, Dickie Moore as The Kid and Ken Niles as Leonard Eels. There were one or two moments of interest, but until I see it again properly, I can't give high praise for it. Worth watching!",Out of the Past
14,ccthemovieman-1,There Was A Better Mitchum-Greer Noir,6,24 March 2006,"Try as I might, I could never get this film noir starring Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer to be as good to me as it's reputation. This film is often mentioned as one of the best of the film noir genre, but I never found it so. The poster is far better. In fact, if you want to see a more interesting film noir with Mitchum and Greer, then watch ""The Big Steal.""Nonetheless, I think the confusing story with its convoluted storyline brings it down. Unlike most noirs than occur in a big city, this one involves the countryside from San Francisco to Acapulco. Kirk Douglas doesn't have a big role in here but he makes his presence felt. He does a good job of being both menacing and personable at the same time.It also was nice to see this on a good DVD transfer as I was never able to find a good VHS of this movie. It does make the viewing experience a lot better....but I'm still looking for more with this film. I'll say what most ""crtiics"" are afraid to admit: it's overrated.",Out of the Past
15,rmax304823,Wrought Over,7,1 May 2003,"O innocent victims of Cupid, Remember this terse little verse: To let a fool kiss you is stupid, To let a kiss fool you is worse.Fine photography here by Musuraca. If you want a splendid example of ""low key lighting"" check out the scene in which Greer and Mitchum have their first serious conversation at night on the Acapulco beach, her face in shadow, but still her expressions discernible, her hair backlighted and its curls edged with a kind of mellow glow. His face more sharply defined, starkly creased with black and highlights. The rest of the film lives up to that scene, although it is notably lacking in day-lit shots of wide-open spaces. (There's really only one, in a death scene that takes place on a tumultuous river.) Tourneur's direction is efficient. He moves the figures around evocatively, from Tahoe to San Francisco to Los Angeles to small towns in the Sierras. There are two ""sex scenes"" that he has to deal with. In the first, which occurs after the beach conversation, there is a conventional cut from a kiss to the surf rolling onto the sand. But in the second, when the lovers run into ""her place"" for the first time, they are wet from the rain. Mitchum dries her hair by rubbing it harshly then tosses the towel onto the ""one light burning in the place,"" the lamp tumbles to the floor, the door is blown open by the wind, and there is a cut to the torrential downpour on the tropical plants outside. A tour de force of symbolic imagery. Did he laugh while planning it?And that, I fear, is about it for me. I know it's considered a classic example of film noir, and it makes me wonder about why film noir is so highly regarded. Greer, of course, is a beautiful woman, which is nice, and as competent a performer as Mitchum. Except that Mitchum couldn't be described as beautiful. The icons are here -- trench coat, speeding cars, florid dialog, short-barreled black revolvers, hotels in the big city, lots of makeup, fedora hats, neon signs. Kirk Douglas is the most interesting actor. He oozes more insincerity than anyone else in the film, which is saying a lot since absolutely nobody is totally believable.But I've seen this movie about three times over the course of the past decade and simply can't get with it. Mitchum seems tough but dumb. Nobody else is sympathetic. The plot line is twisted, hard to follow, and equally hard to believe. I found myself hoping Mitchum would wind up with the ""nice girl"" at the end, but didn't really care much. It wasn't really tragic when Mitchum and Greer are speeding along the dark road, Greer sees the roadblock, sneers ""You dirty stinking rat,"" and plugs him during the struggle. I kept wondering while watching it, why I found myself comparing it to ""The Maltese Falcon"" and finding it wanting. I couldn't figure it out, really. It seemed disjointed and dull. That's not to say it's trash. There is, after all, the photography and the direction, plus Douglas at his phoniest, in only his second movie. And it's also worth seeing for historical reasons. Everybody says it's a classic example of film noir, so see it and make your own judgment.",Out of the Past

17,blanche-2,Excellent example of film noir at its best,8,17 September 2005,"Full of atmosphere and heat, ""Out of the Past"" is a classic film noir, directed by a master, Jacques Tourneur. Although considered only an above-average B movie at the time of release, it's doubtful anyone thinks of it that way today, as it is superior to many ""A"" films. With a top-notch cast and a deceptively easy pace that belies the tension and danger underneath, ""Out of the Past"" makes for an intriguing, absorbing film.Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer make a great pair - both are sultry, sexy, hard to read, and gorgeous. I found Greer's performance quite interesting. In the beginning, she appears quite warm, frightened, and sincere, as opposed to, say, Lizabeth Scott in ""Dead Reckoning."" When she turns hardboiled, it's subtle, with only a change in her eyes and voice, when she comments that Fisher isn't going to say anything to anybody. I love the way Mitchum sizes up women. He absolutely smolders, and 40 years later, in ""The Winds of War,"" he was still smoldering.Kirk Douglas is appropriately edgy in his supporting role as Whit. Rhonda Fleming has a small role, but no one that incredibly beautiful was going to go unnoticed for long.What a wonderful film, what a perfect example of a genre.",Out of the Past
18,Quinoa1984,perhaps the major studio triumph of Touner's career; cast is fantastic,10,19 May 2006,"To see Robert Mitchum in a film like Out of the Past is to see one of the benchmarks of the film-noir era and style of film. He wears his trench-coat through many scenes of the film, looking weathered yet strong in his own way as he's put against the elements, and there's a certain tragedy in his performance at times even as he's one of the cooler stars of the 1940's Hollywood system. He stars as Jeff Bailey, a private-eye turned gas station attendant with a past involving a woman, a criminal, and a messy affair that left him running into a kind of 'quiet' life. But he's brought back out of it by his old 'boss'- in a terrific early role from Kirk Douglas (his first scene in the film, as well as one with Jane Greer in the third act, ranks as great)- into something of a trap. While director Jacques Tourner and his screenwriter do a very credible job in telling the story, particularly in setting up the characters and the inherent flaws in them all via the flashback romance, is that the atmosphere trumps over. Tourner, who had his early breaks in the B movies of Val Lewton, does the story and the characters a splendid service in how he gets down the urban settings, and even the scenes in Mexico, on the beach, in a very foreboding office towards the end of the film. There are a few taut twists, but they all work, and the entanglement of Jeff, Kathie and Whitt is one of those classic examples of how its down believably. You might be able to sense what could have been between Jeff and Kathie, but in this situation who's to say why it shouldn't be as dark and (perhaps) existential as this? It's not a humorless film either, and seeing it in an sold-out audience is a delight to add with the entertainment.",Out of the Past

NOTES: Dick Powell was announced to star in ""Build My Gallows High"" after completing ""Johnny O'Clock"".Locations: Reno, Nevada; Lake Tahoe, San Francisco, Los Angeles, California; Mexico City, Acapulco, Mexico.COMMENT: A suspenseful, if somewhat complicated detective thriller, scripted by Daniel Mainwaring from his own novel ""Build My Gallows High"". The dialogue is laconically witty and Jacques Tourneur's direction builds up atmosphere and suspense with praiseworthy agility. Photography (Nicholas Musuraca) and art direction (Albert S. D'Agostino, Jack Okey) are further plus factors, and performances are most capable. In short, a superior thriller.OTHER VIEWS: I wrote the first draft and then went on to something else. Producer Warren Duff put Frank Fenton, and then James M. Cain on it, and Cain threw away my script and wrote a completely new one. They paid him twenty or thirty thousand and it had nothing to do with my novel or anything. He took it out of the country and set the whole thing in the city. Duff didn't like it and called me back, and I made some changes and did the final. That's the way things used to work. As for Dore Schary, he didn't like anything that was in progress at the studio when he was appointed chief of production. He tried to get rid of them all. He just threw them out without any decent publicity. – Daniel Mainwaring. Bob (Mitchum) is a marvelous actor and was so considerate of me. I am very fond of him. On the other hand, Kirk is a more physical actor. He bruised my arms grabbing me, and my face was roundly slapped. How he did Champion without maiming his partner is a miracle. – Jane Greer.AVAILABLE on a superb Warner's DVD.",Out of the Past

An ardent cigarette smoker, Mitchum is a nonchalant narrator and protagonist. As the wordless ""Kid"", young Moore does well after a three year screen absence (he served in World War II). In a figure flattering dress, also watch for Rhonda Fleming (as Meta Carson) to make a big impression.******** Out of the Past (11/13/47) Jacques Tourneur ~ Robert Mitchum, Jane Greer, Kirk Douglas, Dickie Moore",Out of the Past
21,Coventry,Who needs Humphrey?,9,26 December 2016,"The first thought that spontaneously comes to mind when you hear or read about ""Out of the Past"" is likely to be: why isn't Humphrey Bogart starring in this? After all, Bogart was the indisputable king of the film-noir genre during the '40s and '50s and – solely based on the plot synopsis and seedy movie poster – this already looks like a genuine landmark of the genre. But alas, RKO purchased the rights instead of Warner Bros. and thus Humphrey was out of the picture. The film is often (righteously) labeled as one of the greatest classics in cinematic history, but mainly just by critics, and surely it would have been a much bigger commercial success in case it really had starred Bogart. Personally, I don't really mind  As much as I love Humphrey Bogart, I'm also a gigantic fan of the terrific Robert Mitchum and think he was one of the most sadly underrated actors of all times. Even though Mitchum wasn't the first choice to play the lead role in this movie (or even second or third, for that matter), he does a terrific job and certainly contributes a great deal to the powerful impact of the overall film. ""Out of the Past"" is the epitome of film-noir cinema and features all the great ingredients of the genre in exactly the right proportions. The story takes place in a thoroughly depressingly bleak and corrupt world, full of deviant and unreliable individuals that only care about money and themselves. Robert Mitchum, as Jeff, is the ideal anti- hero for a gloomy tale like this. He runs a small gas station in a godforsaken little town and is engaged to a beautiful local girl, but his life certainly wasn't always as inconspicuous as this. Jeff's secretive past as borderline private detective catches up with him when a henchman of the fearsome gambling tycoon Whit recognizes him whilst driving by the town. Jeff used to work for Whit and was assigned to track down his girlfriend Kathie as well as the stolen sum of $40.000. Jeff found Kathie in Mexico, but naturally fell for the charms of this ultimate femme fatale, and together they decided to run off. Kathie didn't turn out to be the faithful lover that Jeff hoped for and she ran off again. This already sounds like a full and weighty plot description on itself, doesn't it? And yet, these events are only just narrated by Jeff through an atmospheric flashback. Now that he has been exposed, Jeff has to confront both Whit and Kathie again, and what ensues is a tangled but compelling web full of mystery, intrigue and deceit. Every tiniest detail in ""Out of the Past"" is impeccable. Jacques Tourneur demonstrates that he can do more than just direct atmospheric low-budget horror (he previously directed the stupendous ""Cat People"" and ""I Walked with a Zombie""), Daniel Mainwaring's screenplay (adapted from his own novel ""Build my Gallows High"") is waterproof to the smallest detail, cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca hits exactly the right film-noir tone with his excessive use of shadows and lighting and Robert Mitchum is surrounded by a phenomenal supportive cast. Judy Greer is the perfect femme fatale, Rhonda Fleming is a woman that I would instantly marry and living legend Kirk Douglas deeply impressive as the nefarious bastard Whit. ""The Maltese Falcon"" may forever remain the quintessential film- noir, but as far as I'm concerned, ""Out of the Past"" is a really close second.",Out of the Past
22,michaelRokeefe,Evocative Film-Noir. Hard not to like.,9,4 November 2008,"A very definitive noir classic directed by Jacques Tourneur. You can't get much better than this. Jeff Bailey(Robert Mitchum), a chain-smoking former-gumshoe trying to change his life by running a small gas station in Connecticut, is visited by a man from his past(Paul Valentine). Joe Stephanos urges Jeff to take a small trip to meet with a wealthy gambler/mob guy Whit Sterling(Kirk Douglas). Sterling wants to hire Bailey to track down his jilted lover Kathie(Jane Greer), who left a slug in his shoulder and disappeared with a small fortune in cash. Bailey takes the offer and finds the femme fatal in Mexico with no idea what the gambler's former mistress plans on doing and with whom. Not only is Sterling concerned with Jeff's situation, but also is his former detective partner(Steve Brodie)and local love interest(Rhonda Fleming). Sets and scenery are superb. And a finale that you don't expect. Also in the cast: Dickie Moore, Richard Webb and Virginia Huston.",Out of the Past
23,jotix100,Scheming dame,10,20 January 2005,"Jacques Tourneur will probably be remembered best for this film, even though he had an extensive career in Hollywood. Working with Daniel Mainwaring, the author of the novel in which this movie is based, he created one of the best pictures of this genre, one that will be a perennial favorite. Mr. Tourneur and his cinematographer, the brilliant Nicholas Musuraca, made a stunning looking film that looks as good today, as when it was originally released.If you haven't seen the film, please stop reading now.Jeff Bailey has reinvented himself as the owner of a gas station in California. His past comes to haunt him at the beginning of the movie. Jeff has found peace and love in the small town where he has taken refuge. He can change his identity, but he can't hide from the people that want to see him dead.We watch in the beginning how Jeff is sent away by Whit Sterling to look for the disappearing Kathie Moffat, who has stolen forty thousand dollars and gone hiding. Jeff finds her in Acapulco. Kathie gives a bad name to any other dames in the movies of this genre. She is totally ruthless; she will do anything to double cross Whit as well as have Jeff do whatever she wants.Comparisons have been made between ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Out of the Past"". Both have plots that are twisted; when we feel we know everything, there is a new twist to the story. We are constantly misled into thinking one way, when in reality, something else has happened.This is a film that combines all the elements of the classic film noir and juxtaposes it against the serene surroundings of where Jeff is now living. Black and white photography was used to great advantage in the movie. It has a style that makes it one of a kind. The music by Roy Webb plays neatly in the background without interrupting the action.The acting is first rate. Mr. Tourneur got a brilliant performance from Robert Mitchum. His Jeff, is the epitome of coolness. It's hard to understand the mentality of American cinema of the times not paying Mr. Mitchum his due. He was a much better actor than he was given credit for. His presence looms large in this movie and it's a tribute to him that he makes his character dominate the movie.Jane Greer was also excellent in her take of Kathie Moffat. She is pure evil, a sensuous woman who will do anything to get her own way. When we see her in Acapulco she is a seductress that no man can resist. She leads Jeff on by the sheer power of the desire he feels for her. Ms. Greer was not a beauty, by Hollywood standard, but yet, she makes an incredible contribution to the movie. Her textured performance is exquisite in its economy. We all see right through her, yet, she takes us for an incredible ride, up to the end of the picture.The others in the cast do an excellent job. A young and dashing Kirk Douglas is perfect as the dubious Whit. He shows such a magnetism, even then, at the start of his career in movies. Rhonda Fleming had a small role and she makes most of it. Also Virginia Huston, as Ann, makes a great contribution to the film.The film, ultimately, is a tribute to the talent of the director. This is Mr. Tourneur's best movie.",Out of the Past
24,Scarecrow-88,Out of the Past,10,13 February 2011,"Well, build my gallows high, baby.Deciding to go on a film noir kick, choosing OUT OF THE PAST was an easy starting place if ever there was one. All the elements are represented. The femme fatale, played by Jane Greer, who is cunning in how she can deceive the men in her orbit. The lowly detective(Robert Mitchum) who is hired to find her, falling for Greer while in Mexico hot on her trail, getting caught in a web he can not escape. Kirk Douglas a tax cheat millionaire who hired Mitchum to find Greer and the $40,000 she stole from him. If Mitchum had just found Greer, contacted Douglas telling him of her whereabouts and finished the job as he was supposed to, maybe he could have avoided the later complications which develop. Greer is bad. She isn't above using men in order to slither out of situations which might place her in harm's way(often of her own making, such as the stunt where she left Douglas with his cash, was a major figure in Mitchum's framing for a tax specialist's murder, etc). Mitchum's mistake was falling for her. He couldn't help himself and the result ties him to both Greer and Douglas. Douglas, because Mitchum took his money and didn't report he had found Greer, living it up in Mexico among other places. Greer, because Mitchum and her had the affair and he cannot seem to sever the tie that binds them. What makes OUT OF THE PAST wonderfully noir is the crackling dialogue, twisty plot, and a cast to die for. All the parts, from the leads to the supporting players, are expertly cast, especially Greer, who uses her looks and phony innocence as tools to manipulate and destroy. Mitchum has a multi-faceted hero who uses his smarts in an attempt to stay one step ahead of Douglas and Greer, ultimately doomed because of his association with them. While trying to outsmart Greer, Mitchum underestimates her skill at maneuvering out of a sticky problem when he believes he has her in a trap that is fool-proof involving the shooting of his slimy partner (Steve Brodie) who was wanting the $40,000 as hush money to keep her location from Douglas. With Virginia Huston as Mitchum's other love interest, Ann(he was hoping to start over with her, running a gas station in her small town), Richard Webb as a local in love with Ann and who believes Mitchum's Jeff is bad news, Paul Valentine as Douglas' hook(Joe, also working a scheme with Greer's Kathie, probably another flunky she was working over) and Dickie Moore as deaf and dumb kid who works at Jeff's gas station, a marvelous cast can work wonders. This movie had so much going right, it's no wonder OUT OF THE PAST has stood the test of time and remains so revered among fans of film noir. I liked how the film's title coincides with the overall story of the movie. Jeff tried to make a go of it—to assume a new identity, find a place off the beaten track, romance a wholesome local girl who become devoted to him despite their short courtship, and attempt a fresh start. Unfortunately, the past has a way of resurfacing, and interesting enough, Jeff accepts that he will have to once again meet Whit(Douglas) and Kathie, not putting up a fight because he knows it would be futile. And, perhaps, Jeff knew during his conversation with Whit's hood Joe that his fate could end grimly. I like Mitchum's scenes with Huston because she represents the ideal candidate Jeff would like to substitute for Kathie, because she has no agenda or ulterior motives. The idyllic area near Jeff's gas station, the stream, hills, rocks, is the perfect substitute for the urban city and the crime that thrives within such a setting. This small town is exactly the kind of place a man could run and hide in, yet Jeff still cannot bury away the past which will not stay buried. And so Jeff resigns to the fact that it was worth a shot, but the demons of the past have a way of finding you. Film noir rarely ends happily for any of the principles as this movie establishes all too well. Mitchum was polluted due to his connections with the criminal element, and it would take a self-less act on his part to right wrongs which would put a stop to Greer once and for all.",Out of the Past
25,Hey_Sweden,"Mitchum is, once again, the King of Cool.",8,28 August 2017,"Quintessential 1940s film noir stars Robert Mitchum as Jeff, eking out a living running a service station in a small town. He's also dating local girl Ann (Virginia Huston), and he's forced to fess up to his past life when old associates come calling. He'd been hired by a mobster named Whit (Kirk Douglas) to find Kathie (Jane Greer), who'd shot at Whit and supposedly made off with $40,000. When Jeff finds Kathie, he finds himself taken with her, quite fatefully.""Out of the Past"" was scripted by Daniel Mainwaring (using the pseudonym Geoffrey Homes), based on his novel. It's a well paced, thoughtful, consistently entertaining story that keeps the viewer on their toes with its various developments. One has to wonder if Jeff will be able to extricate himself from this untenable situation. Certainly he seems doomed from the moment he meets Kathie, played by the lovely Greer as one of the most alluring femme fatales to be found in this genre. The theme of a flawed protagonist potentially coming to ruin as the result of infatuation with a deadly dame is certainly classic noir stuff.It's all directed efficiently by Jacques Tourneur, who'd previously made his name guiding other low budget films for RKO, for producer Val Lewton. He proves to be very good at setting a sombre mood right from the start. Everything is attractively shot in a high contrast manner by Nicholas Musuraca, and use of Roy Webbs' music score is sparing.Mitchum was born to play roles like Jeff. He has a real presence playing a man with a rather unflappable nature; not once does he lose his cool. Greer is wonderfully sexy, and Douglas delivers a charming, amiable performance. Top notch supporting players include Rhonda Fleming, Richard Webb, Steve Brodie, Paul Valentine, Dickie Moore, Ken Niles, Theresa Harris, John Kellogg, and Wallace Scott.Memorable dialogue and a feeling of inevitability also help to make this a particular favorite for film buffs.Eight out of 10.",Out of the Past
26,Doylenf,The essential film noir...has everything the genre demands...,7,14 November 2006,"OUT OF THE PAST is like watching a textbook lesson in Film Noir 101.It has so many layers of plots and sub-plots, so much rich B&W texture in Nicholas Musuraca's shadowy photography, so many ambiguous moments that keep you guessing what's around the corner, and so many memorable quotes in scene after scene that you could spend the entire movie just writing down the crafty lines. What a blessing it must have been for these actors to read the script and savor the flavor of the lines they would be reciting.ROBERT MITCHUM, of course, slouching around in trenchcoat and hat on the prowl for the femme fatale, was at his peak as a movie hero, fully aware of the dangers ahead as he meets up with shady old friend KIRK DOUGLAS. (Incidentally, the Mitchum/Douglas chemistry is just as strong, if not stronger, than that between Mitchum and JANE GREER). Greer has the sultry good looks for a femme fatale but she's just a little too poker-faced to make her crimes seem credible.Once the screenplay makes clear that he's about to be more prey than predator, it becomes fascinating to watch the way he falls into the web of deceit so completely. Then the film becomes a little more burdensome to watch as the double crosses begin. There ought to be an ALERT message flashing on the screen as the plot becomes more involved. You need to be watching carefully as events unfold on screen or you'll lose track of the story details that all mesh together at the end.Even the ending is not as deceptively simple as it looks. There are implications that someone is not telling the whole truth, but I won't give that plot detail away here. Stay alert until that final scene and you'll see what I'm getting at.Mitchum, Greer and Douglas are excellent and they have a wonderful cast of supporting players that never let them down. The script is a marvel of how a film noir should be constructed with the clever lines completely appropriate for the characters and never once do they ring a false note.By all means, it's the kind of private eye story everyone can enjoy, as dark and shadowy as any film noir you've ever seen--and then some. It's one of RKO's most memorable noirs.Trivia note: Personally, I like the original title which, I believe, is the title of the novel: BUILD MY GALLOWS HIGH.",Out of the Past

At the time the casting was probably unremarked on but in retrospect what we have here is a couple of icons in their salad days, like young stags trying out their first pairs of antlers on each other. There's more than a nod to Hemingway's The Killer's - the original version rather than the remake - in the frame constructed around the flashback; obvious city-bred street-wise tough guy living the life of a Caspar Milquetoast in the middle of East Jesus. This time around Mitchum's Jeff Bailey has moved one grade up from Burt Lancaster's short-order cook and is the proprietor of a modest filling station where, natch, he is spotted by someone from his past and dragged inexorably back into a world he hoped but didn't really believe he had left behind, there to be framed by Kirk Douglas as the mini-tycoon who had hired him in his days as Private heat to find Jane Greer.

It is hands down the best film noir to be released in the 1940s (even better than ""Double Indemnity,"" high praise indeed from me), and it rivals ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""Kiss Me Deadly"" as my favorite noir of all time.Robert Mitchum plays a regular Joe, quietly living an ordinary life in some out of the way sleepy American town, whose criminal past catches up with him and refuses to let him go. It's reminiscent of last year's ""A History of Violence,"" and explores some of the same themes as David Cronenberg's film: Can we forget the past if the past doesn't want to forget us? Mitchum delivers a spectacular performance; his craggy, mournful face is the very picture of a man who knows he's living on borrowed time. Jane Greer is the sizzling femme fatale who has his number. And Kirk Douglas appears in an early performance as a cold-blooded crime boss.What else can I say about the movie other than it's virtually flawless.

Mitchum is courting one of the town's young ladies, and proceeds to tell her about his rather questionable past in an attempt to clear his conscience. Cue the flashback sequences!Past-Mitchum was hired by Kirk Douglas to find his (Kirk's) girlfriend, Kathy, who has apparently stolen 40 G's and is on the run. Mitchum tracks Kathy to Mexico, meets her in a cafe, and the two quickly strike up a whirlwind romance. From the moment I saw Jane Greer enter that cafe, I instantly knew she was going to play him for a sap (that's just the way the gun fires). Throughout the remainder of the film, the viewer is left wondering who is taking who for a ride, and who is on the level. The plot is filled with murder, threats, fear, greed, dysfunctional friendships/relationships, and two-timing: some of the most prolific characteristics of a noir. Mitchum was his regular noir self (which is a good thing), Jane Greer did a great job as the two-timing, conniving dame, Douglas was eerily convincing as a rather weird corrupt individual (like in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers; 1946), and Dickie Moore played Mitchum's deaf and mute assistant.Aside: 37 years later Hollywood would try to remake this classic. The only thing the two films had in common was Mexico. It was the very first sign that the movies were losing their originality and their nerve. But it was just a rumble of thunder in the distance.

At first Jeff declines but Whit reminds him that he never completed the first job a couple of years earlier and essentially demands his compliance now. What Jeff doesn't realize is that there is much more to this new assignment than Whit is letting on and there is great danger for everyone involved. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a very good film noir with good performances by all involved.

36,ferguson-6,Talk Business or Play House?,8,4 December 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. Finally caught back up to this one after close to 30 years. I have always listed it among my favorite Film Noir movies and now I remember why! The story is not dissimilar to many of the detective films from the 40's and 50's, but this one is based on Daniel Mainwaring's brilliantly titled novel ""Buld My Gallows High"". It stars ultra-cool Robert Mitchum and an up and coming actor named Kirk Douglas, in just his second film.As with any Film Noir, there must be a woman stirring up trouble for the men who just can't seem to think clearly around them. Here we get two fabulous women who can't be trusted: Jane Greer and Rhonda Fleming. We also get some of the most creative lighting you will ever see in a movie. I am guessing the production budget was very small, but the shadows and darkness work very well for the story. The next best part of this one is the stream of classic lines. Some are funny and others are quite jolting given the seriousness with which they are delivered.The movie is directed by Jacques Tourneur, who also directed ""Cat People"" just a few years prior. His best scenes here involve Mitchum, Greer and Douglas playing cat and mouse with dialogue, but I also enjoy Rhonda Fleming's brief but impactful appearance.A couple of interesting notes on those involved. Jane Greer was discovered by Howard Hughes and has some pretty frightening things to say about their time together. She was a very young bride to Rudy Vallee, but Hughes broke up the marriage pretty quickly. Ms. Greer also appeared in ""Against All Odds"" in 1984. That film was basically an updated remake of this film. In that film, she played the mother of Rachel Ward's character. Since this was Kirk Douglas' second film, you can really see how little range he had at this point. Very interesting to compare this to some of his later work.",Out of the Past

On the drive down to Whit,Jeff remembers his dealings in the past with him: Suspecting his girlfriend Kathie of taking his cash,Whit hires private detective Jeff to track her down. Tracking her down,Jeff and Kathie fall in love for each other,which leads Jeff to lying so that she can get away from Whit. Opening Whit's door,Jeff finds that his past has caught up,when he is met by the sight of Kathie.View on the film:Cutting a fine glass figure, Kirk Douglas gives an excellent performance as Whit.Aware that he does not have to shout out a Noir shadow, Douglas gives Whit a slippery charm,wrapped in sharp suits that keeps Whit's ruthlessness just under the surface.

Rolling out of the oil and into the arms of Kathie,Mitchum drills into the torn romantic Noir loner,as Jeff's no-nonsense Noir dialogue is paired by Mitchum of Jeff being unable to turn from siren Femme Fatale Kathie. Making Jeff wait for her arrival, elegant Jane Greer gives an alluring performance as Femme Fatale Kathie,whose air of doomed romantic Noir doubt Greer brilliantly uses to tie the Noir loners back into the past.Bringing his own novel into the present,the screenplay by Daniel Mainwaring emphasises the different Noir tracks of Jeff and Whit sharply,from Whit being surrounded in a lifestyle where he believes he can get anything he wants,to the rugged,folk tale wilderness that Jeff sees on the present horizon. Cleverly linking the two devise Noir loners with the Femme Fatale flame of Kathie, Mainwaring wonderfully uses Kathie's glow to take Jeff and Whit's focus off the Noir pit they are sinking into. Bringing out Greer's full beauty under the sun,director Jacques Tourneur & cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca expertly crack light into the Noir shadows to give the title a rustic romantic atmosphere that burns into the Noir past.

39,HotToastyRag,Very confusing movie,3,18 January 2018,"If I liked the film better, I'd be curious to read the original novel entitled Build My Gallows High, written by Daniel Mainwaring. Mainwaring used a pseudonym and adapted his work for the screen, resulting in one of the most famous film noirs in screen history. The main problem I had with the film Out of the Past was the odd storyline and construction. I imagined a 4 hour running time, including every plot point and character development from an original 800-paged novel-the studios insisted that the film be shortened and the end result was a lack of character development for anyone and a haphazard story cut to bits. I've since learned the original book is only 160 pages, and I can't understand why the film's story was choppy scenes were so confusing.The ""good guys"" are the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" are the ""bad guys"", with no explanation for anyone's behavior. The plot moves so quickly with such swift deviation that I kept pressing pause trying to figure out what was going on; by the end, I'd given up. I got the characters confused and had no idea what was happening.Here's what I was able to get out of the plot: Robert Mitchum runs a garage in a small town. His assistant is a deaf and dumb teenage boy, and his sweetheart is the innocent Virginia Huston. Then, Paul Valentine finds him, and he confesses his secret past to Virginia. His secret past includes being indebted to Kirk Douglas, a gangster who wanted Bob to find and retrieve his runaway girlfriend Jane Greer. If there was a reason why Bob and Kirk were thrown together in the first place, it went over my head. And I couldn't count how many times I got Jane Greer and Rhonda Fleming mixed up! And what was the reason why Dickie Moore was deaf and dumb and inexplicably loyal to Bob Mitchum?I watched the movie because I knew it was famous and I love to drool over Robert Mitchum. If you absolutely love film noir films, you might want to rent this one, but be forewarned. And be on the lookout for the very famous line, ""Baby, I don't care,"" that inspired the title of Lee Server's famous biography of Robert Mitchum!",Out of the Past

He does locate her in Acupulco, where they end up falling in love, though she ends up killing someone, driving him away, but both Whit & Kathie return into his life, with fatal consequences...

41,Mr-Fusion,Just when I thought I was out . . .,7,8 September 2017,"""Out of the Past"" maintains a sterling reputation, and I'm well aware how sacrilegious the following sentence is: I think I actually prefer the remake. It's partly because Jeff Bridges can do no wrong, but ""Against All Odds"" also reaches a level of absorption that you wouldn't expect. Maybe it just fits well with the '80s.But what this movie does have is star power all its own. Robert Mitchum has the ideal face; indifferent one minute, and world-weary the next. And he's matched on the screen by Kirk Douglas' good-natured villainy. And even I didn't see that ending coming. It's as fatalistic as noir gets. 7/10",Out of the Past

Roy Webb's score is effective and Nicholas Musuraca's cinematography faultless. Robert Mitchum is solid and reliable in the lead role and ably supported with a delicious and nuanced performance from Jane Greer. I was never a fan of Kirk Douglas' mainstream career but in this early effort as with a personal favourite of mine from the next year, My Dear Secretary, he is a fabulous presence.

The hypnotic, if a bit complicated, Robert Mitchum/Jane Greer classic ""Out of the Past"". Working at his gas station in Bridgport Calif. Jeff Baily aka Jeff Markham, Robrt Mitchum, is trying to escape from his past and start a new and less stressful life but fate in the form of mobster Joe Stepanos,Paul Valentine, steps in and ruins all his future plans.Joe finding Jeff in Bridgport tells him that his former boss Whit Sterling, Kirk Douglas, want's to see him back in Lake Tahoe. Jeff knows instinctively that his future is going to be anything but peaceful.Taking his girlfriend Ann, Virginia Huston,along Jeff tells her about his dark and shady past, in a long flashback. We then go back some three years when Jeff Markhan was a private detective working for the big time gambler and racketeer Sterling in New York. Sterling is shot and left for dead by his moll Kathie Moffat, Jane Greer, who took off with $40,000.00 of his money never to be seen or heard from again. Jeff taking the case from Sterling to find Kathie travels to Mexico sensing that that's where Kathie would go to get away from the grip of the Sterling Mob. Kathie has no idea that Whit is alive after she shot him for she didn't wait around to find out. Finding Kathie at the Mexican seaside town of Acapulco Jeff instead of informing his boss by telegram of his findings keep it to himself and develops a relationship with her. That leads to them both taking off and leaving Mexico to go on the lamb, and away from the Sterling Mob, in California.In the San Francisco Bay area Jeff by chance sees his fellow private eye and Sterling employee Jack Fisher ,Steve Brodie, at the racetrack. It's then that he knows that it's only a matter of time when Whit finds both him and Kathie and exacts his vengeance on both of them for two timing, by Kathie, and double-crossing, by Jeff, him.The movie ""out of the Past"" goes back and forth with it connecting two murders, one in Jeff's past and the other that happens late in the film, that he's framed for by Whit Sterling in order to blackmail him. Knowing that he's a marked man and hasn't long to live Jeff tries to distance himself from Ann. Not wanting to bring her into the world that he came from and is now reluctantly going back to. At the end of the movie Jeff's close friend the mute and hearing impaired Kid, Dickie Moore,who works at his gas station lies to Ann about Jeff's true feelings about her in order to keep Ann from falling apart over him leaving her.

46,Lejink,Noir classic,8,29 December 2009,"Thanks to the BBC this year for its additional festive present to film noir lovers like me by running a season of classics over this Christmas period, including this classic.Employing most of the classic noir devices such as a hard-boiled (ex)-private eye (Robert Mitchum), scheming, beautiful femme fatale (Jane Greer), plenty double-dealing, fisticuffs and murders, this involving tale grabs you from the off. I won't attempt to summarise the plot, just watch the movie and let it pull you in, pretty much the way that Greer's character does to Mitchum.The movie seems to me to rely a little less on the more expressionist exhibitions of noir cinematography, although there is darkness and shadow at key scenes, particularly when Greer kills Mitchum's erstwhile partner, out for his share of the finder's fee and I also enjoyed the car-subjective shot in the very opening scenes, a little reminiscent of Welles' tour-de-force tracking shot at the start of 'Touch of Evil'. From there the typically convoluted plot takes us on Mitchum's travels as he tracks down only to fall irresistibly for gangster's moll Greer, on the run from spurned tough guy Kirk Douglas. The myriad plot developments this time are discernible (not always the case with film noir narratives) and as ever all the loose ends are violently tied up up by the conclusion, taking in a bitter-sweet final vignette just for good measure to allow Mitchum's new girl-friend to let his memory go and get on with her life.The acting is as good as you'd expect, Mitchum the definition of tough laconic-ism, ditto Greer as dangerously beautiful and Douglas as malevolently powerful, with everyone else in support right on the money too. The dialogue is just short of Chandler / Hammett standards, but still contains some genre classics, none more so than Mitchum's 'Baby I Don't Care' (taken later as the title of an excellent biography of Mitch's) uttered mid-clinch to Greer as he willingly trips, stumbles and falls for her considerable, but perilous charms.Quite simply, one of the best thrillers to come out of the whole noir era which I heartily recommend.",Out of the Past

Though this film-noir was obviously an inspiration for Cronenberg's flick, it thankfully diverges from that familiar story fairly quickly (I didn't want to simply see a neutered version of that picture after all, no matter which came first). Despite the picture's great writing and acting, the convoluted and long-winded plot gets in its own way on more than one occasion and slows this feature down.

A gas station owner (Robert Mitchum) is courting a young woman (Virginia Huston) in a small town, when a man from out of his past arrives. A gangster (Kirk Douglas) wants to have a word with him, because as we find out in a flashback, he was once a detective hired to track down a woman (Jane Greer) ... and that's all I'll say about the plot. What I loved about it is that all three of the main characters are cool, tough, and intelligent, so that as it plays out, it's like watching a three-way version of a game of chess. Mitchum, Douglas, and Greer all deliver very good performances, and the dialogue is suitably snappy (""She can't be all bad. No one is."" ""Well, she comes the closest."") The fact that Mitchum's character is in two very different love triangles adds another dimension to it, and puts him into interesting situations. The deaf character (Dickie Moore) also has a couple of great moments, which are very well played. I don't think I connected quite as much with this one as others (wow, its reputation seems to have a life of its own!), but on the other hand, I don't think you can go wrong with it either.",Out of the Past
49,secondtake,"A script the equal of Maltese Falcon, and great photography, great acting!!",10,14 March 2010,"Out of the Past (1947)The writing and the plot of this complex, richly envisioned film noir ranks among the best. If you haven't seen it, plan to see it twice. Supposedly Scorsese recently screened it for DiCaprio, and Leonardo stood up at the end and claimed it was the best darned movie he ever saw, or something like that. And it really does have all the subtle elements in the writing and acting to give this power even to insider Hollywood pros. Or especially to people who really know and love movies. And who want to.Jane Greer is a femme fatale to make rattlesnakes cower, and yet she has that screen beauty to turn every head and cause good men to make bad decisions. (This is the definition of femme fatale.) Even the canny Robert Mitchum can't avoid her wiles. The young and powerful presence of Kirk Douglas adds a new casual twist to the mobster boss stereotype--he's likable without that caricature mob styling of other noirs. The ""good"" woman is especially tragic, and believable, too, in the form of little known Virginia Houston (who makes a bookend to her career in the fabulous Sudden Fear five years later). There are some novelties to the movie as a noir type, mainly the outdoor setting for some of the main scenes. But there is plenty of urban night stuff, and the more common (and well crafted) relationships between detectives and mobsters and the women above. The photography is classic dramatic stuff--watch near the very end how the camera follows Mitchum to one side of the car, the girl gets in, and then it glides across the front to watch him come around and get in the other side. This is so fluid and slight, you never really pay attention, but it's part of the slick way the movie makers keep the continuity and the verisimilitude at a high, dramatic pitch. Cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca is one of the best of the noir style, an unsung master (check his list of credits on this site and see all the great ones he's photographed). The director, it should be noted, is French born Jacques Tourneur, who made a number of interesting films (including the famous Cat People) as well as many B-movies. He shows a touch for tenderness that reminds me of Nicholas Ray, and the last, moving, minutes of the movie will make you want to watch it all again for other nuances.",Out of the Past

He finds her alright, but they fall in love, and try, and fail, to begin anew by themselves.Told partly in retrospect the film plays with its timeline creatively and adds a touch of sophistication to what would otherwise be a straight-forward narrative. Mitchum emotes very little as the sly gumshoe while Kirk Douglas plays the villain with a pleasant air of cheerfulness.But what disappointed me is the absence of darkness. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of alleyways, gusts of wind, lightning flashes and shadows...but just not enough. I was left with no lasting images in my head, which is a big reason why I am a fan of the genre. Too many scenes were set in bright daylight with wide open spaces.

With Kirk Douglas, Rhonda Fleming, Richard Webb, Steve Brodie, Virginia Huston, Paul Valentine, Dickie Moore, Ken Niles.A true masterpiece of film making and obviously a or perhaps rather, THE Leading Exponent of the 'Film Noir' Genre. It seems very hard indeed to find any weak points. In consideration of just about aspect of this movie, it surely makes the grade. If this were to be a report card for the Director, French Born, Jacques Tourneur, would be a ""Straight A Student."" A movie that is said to be 'Film Noir' has been defined as a film wherein things start out at the bottom and steadily and continually get worse. Well that definition certainly fits OUT OF THE PAST.The story starts out with a well dressed out of towner 'Dude', Joe Stephanos (Paul Valentine) stopping in at the local Gas Station and Grill, inquiring about the Service Station's owner Jeff Bailey alias Jeff Markham (Mitchum).Upon their meeting, Jeff is warned by the young deaf-mute Kid (Dickie Moore), who works at the Filling Station. Without finding out all, we learn that Stephanos had just accidentally spotted Jeff at the Station and having recognized him, sought him out and demanded a pay-off in order to have his whereabouts kept as their secret.Jeff (Mitchum) immediately summons his Lady, Ann Miller (Virginia Huston) and on taking a lengthy drive over to Lake Tahoe, Jeff reveals his past.We learn that he had been a Private Detective and partners with a Jack Fisher (Steve Brodie). They had accepted a job to do some gum shoeing in tracing down a ""girlfriend"" of Big Time Gambler/Gangster, Whit Sterling (Mr. Kirk Douglas). The 'Lady', Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) is said to have shot Sterling, though not fatally. She also is thought to have split for Mexico with $40,000.00 of the Boss's (1947) cash.Jeff and Jack Fisher take the job, with Jeff insisting on doing the field assignment, while Fisher holds down the fort. They agree to a 'right down the middle' split of their payments for services rendered.Down Acapulco way, he finds her and they get up-close and personal. So, they go ""on the Lamb"" and avoid all the usual places, but after a while they're spotted by old partner, Jack Fisher, who also decides on blackmailing as a payment method of choice, as it would be far more lucrative.So, about 2 or 3 killings and an equal number of double crosses later, we wind up back at the original town, with all the principals back together, and fighting over the cash like a pack of wolves.And it is here that we will stop and say that this is one super film in any Genre and should be in one's Film Library. The dialog in particular, is lively, bright even funny at times. The Black & White photography actually amplifies the effect of the film's storyline and, along with the fine cinematography, serves to put the viewer right in the picture, without one's knowing it.And the scenario takes in a rapid Merry-Go-Round ride from Tahoe, to L.A. Acapulco, San Francisco and eventually right back to the very spot on the map where we started.

Short Review -A detective noir gets senti when escape was a better option. Whenever there is love and sentiments involved in a detective film i quite feel like losing interest especially when it is going to affect claimax badly. Out Of The Past is a film of a smart detective, a scheming dame and an innocent civilian girl surrounding around love, betrayal, money and conspiracies. As expected there are plenty of twists in this detective film but there are lots of emotions and love scenes in there, which seems overflown. I expect any detective film to end on a twisty note but Out Of The Past goes too senti when there was an option of a well planned escape. Robert Mitchum plays a detective named Bailey/Jeff who falls in love with a dame called Kathie played by Jane Greer who clearly seems to be betraying him for the sake of money and something that we never get to know. Then there's another conspiracy in the 2nd half when Jeff looks like he's on driving seat but somehow ends up as a clueless guy. That's doesn't suit the Standard of a smart detective you know. Every cast member here is excellent even if many of them have small roles. Jacques Tourneur takes the entire narrative by strong grip helped by awesome dialogues and delivers almost a classic noir. It is just that i don't prefer love and emotions over twists in a mysterious detective film. He was an honest detective but love made him dishonest and may be that's why he had to pay for it. That could be one logic here but indigestible. There must be many people who had loved it as the way it is because sacrifice is the one thing that looked promising in the climax. I just wish it had intellegent climax just like dialogues suggested in the entire journey.RATING - 7/10*",Out of the Past
57,l_rawjalaurence,The Quintessential Film Noir,9,4 June 2014,"There isn't much that can be said about Jacques Tourneur's film that hasn't already been said before. The plot is monstrously complicated, but really doesn't assume too much importance; what matters more is to savor the atmosphere created by Nicholas Musuraca's camera, as it tracks moodily round a series of dingy interiors that contrast starkly with the bright light of Jeff Bailey's (Robert Mitchum's) gas station. In this world there are no such concepts as ""good"" and ""evil"": the characters are perpetually out to exploit one another. Jeff might be considered the ""hero"" of the film, but his motives are often questionable - although he does not actually commit murder, he becomes involved in a series of plots initiated by Whit (Kirk Douglas), and subsequently tries to double-cross him. Mitchum's performance is pure film noir - clad in dirty raincoat and battered hat, he is the epitome of cool, only becoming emotional when really necessary. He has to work hard for our attention, however, particularly in the scenes with Kathie (Jane Greer), whose motives can never be trusted. Alternately manipulative and winsome, she has the capacity to twist any man - Jeff included - round her little finger. Her verbal tussles with Jeff are one of the film's highlights: whenever we think that Jeff has the measure of her, she eludes him. In this kind of universe, ""good"" characters like Ann (Virginia Huston) have little chance of survival; despite the fact that her love for Jeff remains constant, she can never stay close to him. The action of OUT OF THE PAST (BUILD MY GALLOWS HIGH in the UK) starts slowly, but then builds to a compelling climax in which there are no winners.

Douglas follows Mitchum following Greer to Mexico; murder and robbery follow everywhere femme fatale Greer goes.  She's excellent; vulnerable eyes revealing the fear motivating her totally irrational, greedy actions.  She and Mitchum are made for each other (it's a shame that this and the less exciting ""The Big Steal"" are their only films together as far as I know, although Greer did make a good pairing with the comparably skilled Richard Widmark in ""Run for the Sun"").  Every step of their twisted journey feels inevitable, painful, and joyous, like a death-row inmate smoking his last cigarette.  Mitchum is at his best here as the patsy for Greer and Doublas' schemes, who plays along as if he knows better but is truly seeking absolution from death.One of the best films ever made by Hollywood, all the more amazing considering it was made almost on the fly (what people today call a ""film noir"" but what the producers though of as a ""B"" movie). 
Tourneur is one of the best low budget directors in the business; fans of good film will seek out his movies, which cover all the different genres of film.

60,robert-temple-1,One of the Best,10,11 February 2009,"What a sizzler! You don't get more noirish than this. No matter how many times I see it, it just gets better and better, like burgundy. Jane Greer's performance is one of the most subtle and sophisticated portrayals of a corrupt female ever filmed. The way she alternates between domination and whimpering submission in the twinkling of an eye, over and over again, like a dog that fawns before it can be beaten, then snarls and snaps, then fawns again, her innate compulsion to lie and conceal, her ruthlessness, her weakness, her lack of hesitation to kill, her need to steal, her passion, her lust, her self-contempt intimately interlaced with an obscene self-love, is all simply spectacular. In this brilliant story and script by Daniel Mainwaring, she seems to replicate her weird relationship with Howard Hughes by being the moll of smooth gangster Kirk Douglas, who at 31 was in only his second film role and pulls it off wonderfully by seeming much older. The hero is Robert Mitchum, he of the gliding hipster walk and shoulders as broad as a bus, who looks down at Greer with alternating infatuation and horror, a helpless victim of her irresistible allure, but also adept at saving himself from danger time after time, and not hesitant at telling her to get lost. (However, no man can really tell Jane Greer to get lost, because who can resist her?) The direction by Jacques Tourneur surpasses even his usual excellence. Dickie Moore adds a superb and haunting touch of strangeness as a deaf-mute devoted to Mitchum. Rhonda Fleming, in only her fifth credited screen role, puts plenty of her own glamour about, and isn't leaving the field wholly to Greer. The script has lots of terrific one-liners, which are highly amusing, if occasionally corny. There are plenty of such opportunities to laugh out loud. Sometimes the drollery is exaggerated on purpose, such as when Rhonda Fleming says to Mitchum at her first meeting: 'Do you always leave your fingerprints all over a girl's shoulder? Not that I'm complaining, mind you. You have big strong hands.' But Mitchum has seen gals like Rhonda before, and isn't falling for any of that stuff. This film isn't really about the story, it's about the people and the atmosphere. Who cares who shoots whom, who falls off a cliff into a river, who steals whose documents, who gets the dough or doesn't get the dough. That's all beside the point. What matters is the gallery of accentuated types being portrayed in this fantasy tale by these actors who set the cinema on fire, and who are intensely glowing inside like charcoal on a barbecue grill: somebody is going to get burnt.

Does it really deserve to be touted in the top ten noirs of all time? To my mind I would say the film is thoroughly watchable but maybe due to what I would argue is its glacial pacing as well as a lack of enough suspense overall, it only rates as a bit above average in comparison to the top noirs of all time.
The film is really divided into two distinct parts. The first involves former private eye Jeff Markham (Robert Mitchum) who goes by Bailey at the beginning of the film after adopting a new identity as a filling station owner.. After being contacted by a former business associate, Joe Stefanos (Paul Valentine), he's informed that their former employer Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas), a shady horse race investor, wants to see him again after three years have gone by.
As he drives up to see Whit in Lake Tahoe, Jeff relates to his current girlfriend Ann Miller (Virginia Huston) that he was earlier hired by Whit to find Whit's girlfriend Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) who shot him and made off with $40,000 of his cash. Whit had promised he just wanted his money back and no harm would come to Kathie.
Now here is the main problem with the film's opening salvo. Basically it takes 35 minutes before anything suspenseful happens. Instead, we're treated to Jeff's long-winded courtship of Kathie after he finds her in Acapulco and ends up seduced by her. This leads us to questioning the plausibility of the femme fatale character in films noir in general. Why is it so easy for Kathie to seduce Jeff? Isn't he a hard bitten private eye who should have realized that the woman he's dealing with just shot a mobster and stole money from him-in other words a dangerous character?
I don't see exactly what's so special about Kathie that men are so easily manipulated by her. And even Whit (a little later on) takes her back, even though she shot him earlier and stole all that cash. Are mobsters so forgiving? For those who argue this is what film noir is all about, I say stories still need to be somewhat credible. So unless you can develop a truly unique femme fatale, just the fact that these women are femmes fatales does not imbue them with special powers that would overwhelm their man's reason, especially since such men are in much greater positions of power vis-à-vis their female companions.
Finally after those aforementioned 35 minutes have gone by, Kathie murders Fisher, the private eye to whom Jeff had promised $10,000 which Whit had promised for Kathie's return. While not very plausible, I guess an over-the-top Kathie is what the doctor ordered, to move the story along. The act also seals Jeff's fate, since he is inexorably now tied to the murder.
The second distinct part of the film involves Whit's current demand for Jeff to work for him again-Jeff of course was trying to go straight but still ""owes"" Whit after he ran off with Kathie a few years earlier, much to the chagrin of his former employer. It seems that Whit is being blackmailed by a San Francisco attorney Leonard Eels (Ken Niles) over failure to pay Federal taxes. Jeff is tasked with stealing back Whit's tax documents.
Again it takes a while before anything truly suspenseful occurs (namely another murder!). Meanwhile, at this point in the narrative, we end up being a bit confused as to what's going on--Kathie ends up impersonating Eel's secretary Meta Carson (Rhonda Fleming), so that Eel's apartment manager will find his body. In a nutshell Kathie is involved in murdering Eels and attempts to frame Jeff.
The climax of the film takes place where it began: in the Bridgeport area of California. Jeff is saved from being killed by his deaf-mute employee (The Kid) who was working for him at the filling station. And then Kathie inexplicably murders Whit (don't ask me how she accomplishes this so easily but it's just another example of how we're asked to accept implicitly the notion that this over-the-top femme fatale is not only evil but has ""special powers"").
I suppose to its credit, Out of the Past eschews the happy ending with Jeff tipping off the police after being forced to escape with Kathie-only to be shot to death by Kathie while driving. Then Kathie is gunned down by the police, who are waiting for the errant couple.
Nonetheless, Jeff's demise is unexpected-precisely because he leaves his ""good girl"" girlfriend, Ann, in the lurch and on her own to fend for herself.
As I maintained earlier, Out of the Past is thoroughly watchable and includes decent performances by all those involved (although Douglas's role is quite underdeveloped). I just wish things moved quicker as the film is not as suspenseful as it could be. One additional positive point to mention-this is one of the earliest films I can remember in which an African-American woman has a normal, non-stereotyped role. And that is Theresa Harris as Eunice Leonard, Kathie's maid, who informs Jeff as to the possible whereabouts of the missing femme fatale, in the scene in which Mitchum makes his inquiries in a rocking jazz nightclub!",Out of the Past

In any event, Jeff goes to see gambler/gangster Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas) who asks him to find his girlfriend Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) who has shot him and absconded with $40,000 of his money. On the way Jeff explains to Ann about his past and that his real name is Markham.Jeff undertakes the task and ultimately discovers Kathie in Acupulco where they become lovers and attempt to allude Sterling. Ultimately, Jeff's ex-partner Jack Fisher (Steve Brodie) finds them in San Francisco. Fisher confronts the couple and a struggle ensues between the men. During the scuffle, Kathie kills Fisher, and then the fun starts.Kathie suddenly disappears. Jeff returns to Lake Tahoe where Sterling lives and is soon framed by him for the murder of Leonard Eels (Ken Niles) after being set up by his secretary Meta Carson (Rhonda Fleming). Kathie turns up in Sterling's company having gone back to him. After a few more double crosses and murders, Kathie and Jeff manage to get together again and.........Both Mitchum and Douglas were just coming into their own at this time. The interplay between them and the ""femme fatale"" Greer is fun to watch. Former child star Dickie Moore appears as a deaf/mute who worked for Jeff at the gas station. Richard Web appears as Ann Miller's faithful beau who patiently awaits Jeff's downfall.Remade in 1984 as ""Against All Odds"" with Jeff Bridges, Rachel Ward and James Woods in the Mitchum, Greer and Douglas parts respectively.

Bailey tracks Kathie in Mexico and she turns out to be a femme fatale.

Quick-tongued and lethargic, he gracefully plunges deeper into the abyss of uncertainty as he gets caught up in a power game between a man and his girl, and the own pull of his desires versus what he knows is right for him.The acting of these characters as they tumble about their own destruction is superb, but none moreso than the witty dialog that's great even by film noir standards. The directing and cinematography are perfect to, so that it's nearly impossible not to feel pulled along by the roller-coaster ride towards doom. The action NEVER lets up, and just when the film seems to catch its balance, it lunges right over.Highly recommended to fans of noir and anyone who wants to look into the genre, not to mention anybody who likes classics and just about anybody else who has any reason to believe they should watch it.--PolarisDiB",Out of the Past
65,strong-122-478885,Film Noir At The Peak Of Perfection,9,31 July 2013,"The year was 1947.World War 2 had come and gone.The world seemed to have grown-up some since the war. War is like that, sometimes. It has a tendency to mature a lot of attitudes - Even Hollywood's.Post-WW2 movie-making was, to say the least, phenomenal. It was like yet another celebration of glorious victory. Some of the most memorable and impressive films to come out of Hollywood were, in fact, produced between the years of 1945-1960. In my opinion this was Hollywood's ultimate ""hey-day"".Out Of the Past (OOTP) is a prime example of Hollywood movie-making excellence. From its tight script, to the mature dialog and subject matter, to the excellent cinematography, to the great direction, and, last, but not least, to the superb cast and their top-rate performances, OOTP is a classic piece of Film Noir that is arguably the absolute best in its genre.Fact: For many years that followed OOTP's release it was, literally, the one and only film that was used as a yard-stick to measure and rate any other flick that fit into the film classification of Film Noir.OOTP's intriguing plot-line is so intricately woven with double-crosses and even triple-crosses that it will keep any fan of 1940's Film Noir, like myself, hooked from the start to its ""final showdown"" finish.The most notable performance in OOTP was, of course, that of Robert Mitchum. The role of Jeff Bailey was clearly written with Mitchum specifically in mind. Mitchum's strong command of his character never missed a beat.Mitchum was at the absolute height of his career in OOTP. During this era of his profession Mitchum was one of Hollywoood's most popular and bankable actors. It would be another 10 years before chronic alcohol-abuse and reckless partying would ravage his solid good looks and age him prematurely.",Out of the Past
66,ackstasis,"""It was the bottom of the barrel, and I was scraping it.""",8,27 February 2008,"Jacques Tourneur's 'Out of the Past (1947)' has all the required ingredients for the archetypal film-noir: a bold and charismatic hero, wearied by a lifetime of violence and corruption, but reluctantly hauled back into his old world by a past he can't escape; a seductive femme fatale, a seemingly-innocent, pretty enchantress whose loyalty can never be counted upon; a sleazy and vengeful gambler, who's silently holding all the cards that will determine our hero's fate. Daniel Mainwaring's dark and tragic narrative {credited under the pseudonym Geoffrey Homes} combines a linear storyline with reminiscing flashbacks, the latter narrated in a tired, laconic tone of voice by Robert Mitchum {who, after frightening roles in 'The Night of the Hunter (1955)' and 'Cape Fear (1962),' finally convinces me that he can effectively play a hero}. Complete with bleak, shadowy cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca, and no shortage of double- and triple-crossings, 'Out of the Past'  along with Billy Wilder's masterpiece 'Double Indemnity (1944)'  remains one of the purest examples of the film noir style.If Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) thought he could escape his old enemies by purchasing an old gas station in a small American town, then he was sorely mistaken. A previous employer, Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas), a seedy and sly gangster, has sent for him, and, more than likely, the meeting has something to do with Kathie (Jane Greer), the beautiful seductress with whom Bailey {back when he was called Jeff Markham} fell in love when he was supposed to be capturing her. Bailey is a smooth, shrewd operator, and recognises that plans have been drawn against him, but he responds to the situation as one whose judgement should never be doubted. The romance described early in the film, as Bailey recounts his doomed love story to local innocent girlfriend, Anne (Virginia Huston), is deceptively touching, and, despite the clear framing device around which the story is structured, I was completely fooled into sympathising with Kathie, only to be left feeling foolish and hollow as her initial betrayal is revealed.In the United Kingdom, Tourneur's film was released under the title 'Build My Gallows High,' also the name of the novel from which the screenplay was adapted. There are enough sharp, bitterly-ironic snippets of dialogue for me to spend all day listing them, but lines such as ""Baby, I don't care,"" ""if I have to, I'll die last"" and ""you dirty double-crossing rat!"" are pure noir, and serve as an excellent introduction to the style of American film-making that was most prominent from 1941-1958 {basically from John Huston's 'The Maltese Falcon' to Orson Welles' 'Touch of Evil'}. The story comes to a successfully downbeat conclusion, with each of the three main characters meeting a messy and tragic end in a suitably Shakespearian fashion. Though Jeff Bailey was ostensibly our story's hero, he had already committed enough sins by the film's beginning to avoid a happy ending, and his fate was effectively sealed from the moment he chose to revisit his past employer, despite obviously having little choice in the matter. Such is film noir.",Out of the Past
67,AAdaSC,"""Build my gallows high.""",8,2 July 2017,"..says ex Private investigator Robert Mitchum (Jeff) to bad-news girl Jane Greer (Kathie). He is discovered at the beginning of the film in his new hideout by henchman Paul Valentine (Joe) who works for badass Kirk Douglas (Whit) whose character is obviously named after movie legend Whit Bissell. Mitchum has changed his name and has a girlfriend Virginia Huston (Ann) who is unaware of his past which is about to catch up with him. We know that Mitch would much rather lie low and skin up a few doobies but things don't pan out that way for him.It was interesting to read that in one scene when Douglas offers Mitchum a cigarette, Mitchum's relaxed response is ""smoking"" as he already has a ciggie on the go. I remembered that scene as I found it amusing. The reality was that Mitchum just wandered into the scene with an already lit cigarette and ad-libbed his response when Douglas delivered his line. Ha ha. He is one cool customer! It's a great cast with no misfires and I see why it has its reputation as one of the film noir classics. It's missing a seedy bar torch song - otherwise all elements that you'd expect from this genre are there.",Out of the Past
68,alansabljakovic-39044,Film noirs are the best,8,17 January 2020,"Kirk Douglas stole every scene for me. The man is the living legend (but not for long, sorry but that is a fact).",Out of the Past
69,slokes,Film Noir With A Heart,9,14 May 2007,"The genre known as ""film noir"" has as many sine-qua-non exemplars as it does boundaries, ideas it must be nihilistic or be set entirely at night. ""Out Of The Past"" could be the greatest film noir for the way it challenges such assumptions while making its case for greatness. It's a classic anyway.Robert Mitchum stars as a guy named Jeff, pumping gas in Bridgeport, California until history comes to collect him in the form of a sniggering lackey named Joe Stephanos (Paul Valentine). Joe works for this other guy named Whit (Kirk Douglas) who wants Jeff to do a job, one which as it turns out involves a woman named Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) who both Jeff and Whit had a past with. Never mind Jeff now has true love with Ann Miller (Virgina Huston); Kathie has enough hottitude to drag poor Jeff to his doom, however nobly Jeff may try to play his feeble hand.""Is there a way to win?"" Kathie once asked in her past with Jeff.""There's a way to lose more slowly,"" replied Jeff, optimistically more than realistically as things turn out.Crisp dialogue is one key strength of this film, along with fantastic supporting performances by Greer, Huston, Valentine, Dickie Moore as Jeff's one true pal, and especially Douglas, who in an early performance plays down any histrionic ""I Am Sparticus"" expectations you may have with his cocksure, amiable, low-key performance as the main bad guy. ""I fire people, but nobody quits on me,"" he tells Jeff, with only the slightest sense of menace in his eyes. Yet that slightest sense makes all the difference.It helps a lot that Mitchum plays the lead. I was not convinced of his greatness going into this film, but he blows away all doubts. Like imogensara_smith points out in her review here, Mitchum gives a kind of scat-jazz vocalization to his performance, finding the off-center angle to give his words the right flow. Single words like ""Sure,"" ""Okay,"" and ""Thanks"" in his hands feel almost like Sinatra hitting the off-beats on a Sammy Cahn lyric. His longer lines feel every bit as clever as Bogart's in ""Casablanca."" Just Mitchum's opening scenes with Huston, set by criminally-underestimated director Jacques Tourneur to a sunny landscape we might mistake for Hemingway's ""Big Two-Hearted River"" except its California and not Michigan, is enough to make the case for Mitchum's thematic representation as the consummate 20th-century man. Sure, he's laconic, but he kills you all the same.So does Greer, from the first line she says to Jeff, regarding a pair of earrings he offers her: ""I never wear them."" Do you then notice the number of scenes thereafter when she is wearing earrings? Virginia Huston may be wooden, but so is the hull of a boat that keeps it afloat. ""Out Of The Past,"" unlike so many clever, soul-killing film noirs before and after, works not from playing against the grain of human kindness and loyalty but for how it highlights same. Mitchum and Moore both present us with guys who are committed to Hemingway's ideal of ""grace under pressure"" however little they benefit from living by it. Save your ""D.O.A"" and ""Criss Cross"" however sympathetic its heroes; ""Out Of The Past"" gives you a Roman ideal of stoicism whom the gods play with but cannot quite break, however Jeff bends.SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD - I can't claim this film is perfect; unlike a diamond it doesn't benefit from every angle of view. What is Jeff's supposed motive for killing the lawyer Eels? Or Joe's for trying to shoot Jeff? I think I know why Kathie gave Jeff accurate info on where Eels' files went, and it only adds to the drama of their relationship. Ambiguity is a good thing generally, both for making one thing while watching a film and after, something ""Out Of The Past"" proves again and again. - SLIGHT SPOILERS ENDThe best thing about ""Out Of The Past"" is that it resists snap judgments about any of its characters, even Kathie. Why, even snide Joe seems humanized by the sight of death, and Whit may or may not be the victimizer Kathie claims (we see him slap her once, but is he a sadist or reacting to her vicious character the same way Jeff and we have since the movie's first-half was over?) How do Kathie's cat eyes and obvious cunning contrast with memories of sunny Acapulco?You carry memories of Acapulco, too, watching this and trying to figure out who's right or wrong. The human condition is a drag generally, but something about ""Out Of The Past"" makes it seem fun.",Out of the Past

71,Steffi_P,"""Awfully cold around the heart""",9,21 August 2011,"The type of movie we have now come to call film noir is unique among genres (if it is indeed a genre, and that itself is a moot point), in that it is defined by both thematic and stylistic elements. To be accepted as a film noir, a movie must be dark on the screen as well as in story. An example of how this works is the Hitchcock picture Vertigo, which for all its cynical, fate-riddled plot should be thought of as archetypal noir, but it is rarely called one because it is shot in blazing Technicolor. Out of the Past on the other hand is a prime example of how story and style can be melded to make the very epitome of everything film noir conjures up.After Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon and Philip Marlowe in The Big Sleep, the private investigator thriller was practically a subgenre in its own right. Even though the term film noir was not yet known in Hollywood, there is very little about Out of the Past that was not already a cliché. But cliché can be good, if it's done well. Three things make this particular cliché-fest stand out. First is the snappy, quotable dialogue; a mile away from anything people say in real life, but realism was never the purpose of these things. Second a perfect and to-the-point balancing of events. Flashbacks can often be awkward, gimmicky things, but the one in Out of the Past has enough substance to be a story-within-a-story, but is just about short enough to prevent it from unbalancing the bulk of the picture. And finally there is the payoff in the final scene, a moment of poignancy rare in film noir, and one that offers a tiny crumb of comfort without detracting from the general mood of despair.Now let's look at the contribution of director Jacques Tourneur. He displays (in all his movies, even the Westerns) a kind of tight, enclosed look, but one that owes very little to German Expressionism. It is based around placing things in the foreground, often half-on and half-off the screen. Actual close-ups are rare, but there is nevertheless a constant feeling of closeness, with characters squared up around the frame as if their elbows should be rubbing against the screen. Often the focal point is a little deeper in the shot, and Tourneur pulls some brilliant tricks with layers of depth. One example is where Kirk Douglas is questioning Robert Mitchum in a restaurant. As Douglas becomes a little more aggressive and the dialogue becomes more relevant to the plot, the scene becomes visually more arresting, with a waiter tidying up in front of the actors and a family getting up and leaving behind them. Most directors will use framing to draw our eyes one way or another, but Tourneur does it so starkly and firmly just by a simple arrangement, such as the fence that leads away diagonally from the screen to Mitchum and Virginia Huston when he drops her off. Our attention is being forced but everything still looks natural. Tourneur's is a style that is hard on the eye without actually looking overtly stylised. Out of the Past was one of the earliest leading roles for Robert Mitchum, and he wears the part like a glove. His acting is not exceptional here, but he fits in very well. Apparently doing very little, he gives off a kind of atmosphere that is as bleak as the images. His movements, subtle and sporadic as they, are in time with the rhythm of the whole piece. His co-star Jane Greer – not an especially prominent movie actress – is also wonderfully understated, keeping the size of her performance below the level of melodrama, breaking through with steely emotion here and there with exceptional control. No-one else in the cast especially stands out, but they really aren't so supposed to – they are supposed to be part of the general pattern.There is little else to say that Out of the Past makes for a satisfying and enjoyable watch. Cinema is both a storytelling and an aesthetic medium, and it works best when the one angle complements the other. Film noir, often a crushingly dispiriting ""genre"", reaches almost majestic proportions with this offering.",Out of the Past

It turns out Markham welched out on a job a few years back, and Sterling is keen for Markham to repay his debt This is a terrific old film noir classic by the criminally underrated Tourneur, who made several fantastic movies for RKO Pictures during the forties. For purists of the genre, it has everything going for it; the world-weary detective hero, the conniving femme fatale, a supporting cast of double crossers, bewildering plot lines, tough guy lingo (at one point Mitchum tells Fleming, ""If you drop the junior league patter we may get the conversation down to where it belongs.""), and stylish chiaroscuro photography by Nicholas Musuraca. I'm never quite sure what I think of Mitchum as an actor - his lazy drawl style suits some movies but not others - but he fits like a glove here, and a young Douglas is also a lot of fun as the ever-smiling villain. The real star though is Greer as Kathie, the source of all the travails. She has that patented wide-eyed oh-you-must-believe-me stare down pat whilst lying through her teeth, and as the movie progresses she somehow becomes more attractive whilst her actions become more horrific. Sadly, Greer's legacy isn't quite as bright as her contemporary femmes fatales, but don't miss her here; despite being only twenty-two, she turns in a simmering razor blade of a performance. Brilliantly written by the talented Daniel Mainwaring (under his regular nom-de-plume Geoffrey Homes), a great crime novelist and the screenwriter of The Phenix City Story and Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. The UK TV print of this movie is called Build My Gallows High, the title of Mainwaring's pulp classic book. Remade very successfully by Taylor Hackford in 1984 as Against All Odds, in which both Greer and Valentine have small roles.

And what man would blame him - Greer was very alluring, but the big problem was that even if she was taller than Napoleon she would probably have killed as many people if given the chance. At least she was basically a good girl again when they came to do The Big Steal 2 years later. All of the murders committed in here were memorably portrayed and something to mull over afterwards.

I love a movie that can draw more than one emotion at once, and other films I admire accomplish something similar. In Rear Window a second after a laugh, Hitchcock supplies the most startling scene in the movie, Terms of Endearment audaciously mixes bathos with humor, and David Lynch's Wild at Heart takes the cake with... well, just see it.Unfortunately Mitchum couldn't hear me yelling.The character of Joe is a big closet case.

I have felt that remarking on whether a film is good in its genre is less to the point than saying whether it simply is a good movie, and my answer to that for this film is ""yes."" Whether this is classic noir or not, it is certainly classic Mitchum. He is perfect for the role of Jeff Bailey, a world-weary, somewhat fatalistic detective who has a checkered past and is trying to go straight. In this story Bailey gets deeply involved in complicated events that reach out from the past to entrap him. I had to watch this twice to digest all of the shifting feints and double crossings. When gangster Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas in an early excellent performance) says to Baily, ""You just sit and stay inside yourself. You wait for me to talk. I like that,"" Balily replies, ""I never found out much listening to myself."" This is is an example of the great one-liners that punctuate this film, and no one character has a monopoly on them. Many films have aspired to achieve the sharp banter that is on display here, but few have succeeded.In addition to the male leads we are treated to great, sexy performances by Jane Greer (as Kathie Moffat) and Rhonda Fleming. Sterling dispatched Bailey to Mexico to locate Moffat, who is on the lam after shooting Sterling (unsuccessfully) and making off with $40,000. The scene where Bailey awaits Moffat in a Mexican bar and she comes in off the sunlight street has to be one of the greatest movie entrances of all time.A lot of this was filmed on location and seeing the real thing makes you you understand that any contemporary movie really can't capture the period details of the 1940s. I particularly liked the scene where the blown open door signifies that a sexual act has taken place. Sometimes the imagination has more effect than the naked details.The black-and-white photography is stunning. The DVD print I watched was pristine. The effectiveness of the filming made me sad to realize that black-and-white film as a unique art form has pretty much passed from the scene. This makes a film out of the past like this one a treasure.",Out of the Past

In flashback it is learned that Whit Sterling (Douglas) had hired Jeff to find his girl (Greer), who had shot Whit and skipped town with $40,000 of his money. However, when Jeff found her in Mexico, she seduced him and the two of them tried to run away and forget about Sterling. But, when one of Sterling's men, Jack (Steve Brodie), caught up with them, she killed Jack and left Jeff ""holding the bag"".Years later, present time now, another of Sterling's men (Paul Valentine) has found Jeff ""hiding"" in his idyllic setting. Jeff decides to ""come clean"" to his girl before he has to meet Sterling again.

84,seymourblack-1,Achetypal Film Noir,9,12 September 2009,"""Out Of The Past"" is a hardboiled thriller of the highest calibre with superb performances, sharp dialogue and a complicated plot which remains gripping and intriguing throughout. Robert Mitchum in his first starring role and Kirk Douglas in one of his earliest roles are both exceptional and the cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca creates a dark, ominous atmosphere by making clever use of expressionistic shadows. The presence of a tough private investigator, a devious and deadly femme fatale and themes of murder, deception, betrayal, double crosses and fatalism all combine to make this movie an archetypal film noir.The idyllic existence which Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) had been enjoying in Bridgeport, California is suddenly interrupted by the arrival of Joe Stephanos (Paul Valentine). Joe says that his boss, a big time gambler called Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas), wants to see Jeff at his place at Lake Tahoe. Jeff feels compelled to agree and while travelling there tells his devoted girlfriend Ann (Virginia Huston) about his previous dealings with Whit Sterling.In New York, Jeff (whose real name was Markham) and his partner Jack Fisher (Steve Brodie) had been private investigators who were hired by Sterling to find his girlfriend Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) who'd gone missing after shooting Sterling and stealing $40,000. Jeff had located her in Acapulco, fell in love with her and together they relocated to San Francisco. There they kept a low profile and lived happily until Jack Fisher (who had been hired to find them by Sterling) saw Jeff one day and eventually caught up with the couple at a cabin. Jack demanded his cut of the fee which Sterling had offered for bringing Kathie back and their heated conversation led to a fight between the two men which culminated in Kathie shooting Jack dead. She then immediately disappeared leaving Jeff to bury the body. Ann is predictably shocked but regards what happened as being all in the past and says that she wants Jeff to come back to her after he's finished his business with Sterling.At Lake Tahoe, Jeff discovers that Kathie is once again living with Whit and that he knows all that happened between them. Whit seems good humoured and unconcerned about the past and now wishes to hire Jeff to retrieve some tax records which a San Francisco lawyer called Leonard Eels (Ken Niles) is using to blackmail him. The events that follow lead to Jeff being framed for two murders and after a series of complex plot twists and a number of fatalities, the story reaches its denouement which is perfectly in keeping with the mood of pessimism and inevitability which prevails throughout the entire action.Jeff Markham is smart and laid back and also regularly makes brilliant quick witted responses to remarks made by other people. His experiences have made him cynical and jaded but he still passively allows himself to be drawn into perilous situations against his own better judgement. This happens when he betrays Sterling's trust and goes with Kathie to San Francisco and again when he accepts Sterling's second assignment even though he senses that his employer wants revenge and is actually setting him up to be framed for murder. There's a certain inevitability about his actions and their consequences and he seems powerless to alter the course of the events that follow. Even his escapes to San Francisco and Bridgeport prove to be utterly futile.Robert Mitchum with his trademark nonchalance is excellent as Markham and Kirk Douglas gives a memorable performance as Sterling. His good humoured and affable style actually adds greater menace and unpredictability to his character which the audience immediately recognise as a totally ruthless operator. Kathie Moffat is cunning and treacherous and betrays both Sterling and Markham. She also kills three men and sends another on a mission which leads to his death. Jane Greer is perfect in her role and is particularly successful in portraying her character's cold, callous and scheming nature.""Out Of The Past"" is a work of greater intelligence and substance than the vast majority of crime thrillers and a wonderful example of film noir at its purest and best.",Out of the Past

There's nothing like film noir, particularly for whatever reason 40's California film noir. Mitchum gets caught in a nearly incomprehensible cross and double-cross surrounding Douglas, who plays the dapper heavy in a key but thankless role.

The dialogue between Mitchum and Greer (and also Mitchum and Fleming) bristles in that mostly-clever but partly-cheesy fashion unique to this genre. Greer is stunning in a delicate sort of way and Mitch deadpans, chain smokes and squints his way through like nobody's business, the essential Mitchum performance.

86,bmacv,"Not just one of the greatest noirs  one of the greatest movies, period.",10,2 August 2004,"As one of the most emotionally shaded, unforgettable instalments of the noir cycle, Jacques Tourneur's Out Of The Past opens deceptively  not in the neon-lit tenderloin of a big city some rainy night but up in the thin, cool air of the High Sierras, in a little town whose Main and only street boasts an open-kitchen beanery on one side and a gas station on the other.  The sign on the station tells that it belongs to Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum), and when a stranger drops into the diner looking for his old pal Bailey, the waitress remarks `Small world.' `Or big sign,' the out-of-towner cryptically replies. 
Of course it's not a casual call to catch up on times past, because Mitchum has a past, a heavy one that's about to catch up with him, a past that he lived under another name.   The visitor to the mountains is an emissary from silky operator Kirk Douglas, for whom Mitchum, with his partner in the private-eye racket Steve Brodie, has worked before, with fateful results. Mitchum senses that his particular jig may be up, and, before answering his summons from Douglas to meet him at Lake Tahoe, tells his story, in flashback, to his girl (Virgina Huston).A woman (Jane Greer) had shot Douglas and absconded with his $40,000. Douglas engaged Mitchum to play bounty-hunter, to track her down and bring her and the loot back.  His search led him to Mexico and a little bar called La Mar Azul, where she appeared `out of the sunlight,' elusive but radiant, and stole his heart.  A few days later she reappeared, this time `out of the moonlight,' and under that subtropical moon they walked on the beach and then to her cozy bungalow, where a sudden deluge drenched them to the skin and blew open the door to their passion.  Here, Tourneur establishes himself as the Great Romantic of the noir cycle  it's a charged and rapturous idyll.  But even illicit honeymoons must end.  Greer and Mitchum came back to the States, lying low in the North Beach district of San Francisco, until the industrious Brodie, in Douglas' pocket, spotted them at a racetrack.  They lay even lower, thinking they've finally eluded him, but he turned up one night at their mountain cabin, where Greer coldly shot him dead.  Even more startled than Brodie was Mitchum, who saw Greer in a new light that neither sun nor moon provided  with the wrenching realization that she wasn't the innocent victim of bad men and worse circumstances that she'd sold herself to him as.  She clinched the point by high-tailing off, leaving him to dispose of the body (and forgetfully leaving her bankbook, showing a deposit of the $40-grand that she'd lied about never taking). 
So much for the past; the present now beckons, as does Douglas.  He claims to harbor no ill will for Mitchum.  And why should he?  As Mitchum joins him for breakfast on the terrace, Greer is  there, too, eating grapefruit as though nothing had happened.  The past holds no claims on her; she lives the for next advantage the future can offer.  But Douglas has a job for Mitchum, involving a shady lawyer and some compromising papers back in San Francisco.Here the movie takes its most audacious turn (Daniel Mainwaring wrote the script from his novel Build My Gallows High  as Geoffrey Homes  and James M. Cain and Frank Fenton had their hands in it as well).  Right in the middle of Out Of The Past we embark on something close to a movie-within-a-movie, a mini-Maltese Falcon, with a new set of characters and even a new femme fatale (Rhonda Fleming).  The conventional look of film noir  taxicabs and elevators, penthouse apartments at night with the Coit Tower looming in the distance  finally gets full rein.  But then into this murky scheme  a frame-up, really  emerges Greer, this time out of pitch darkness.  The plots within plots begin to converge....Out Of The Past was a pivotal picture for its three principals.  It was only Douglas' second film, but he started big  in a supporting role but a meaty one, as in his debut the previous year in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (they're two of the best roles he would ever take).  Mitchum had spent years in the galleys but finally got a leading role that let him unleash his distinctive persona  the fearless and nimble intelligence behind the nonchalant eyes, the world-weary retorts mumbled from behind the cigarette drooping from his lip (it's Mitchum's own appropriation of what Humphrey Bogart had started).  The best of his many great lines he aims at Greer, calling her a `leaf that the wind blows from gutter to gutter.'   And Greer, who made far fewer movies than her acting (graceful and natural) and her looks (like a less literal Jayne Meadows) would augur, takes her most emblematic credit and plays it to the hilt.  Hers is perhaps the slowest transformation in the noir cycle and the most breathtakingly brutal.  When, for her final scene, she shows up in a snood, it's clear that, for Mitchum, good times are no longer in store.The talent that went into Out Of The Past is manifold.  Both director of photography Nicholas Musuraca and Roy Webb, who wrote the responsive score, were old comrades of Tourneur from his earlier days in Val Lewton's B-movie unit at RKO.  The credentials for the screenplay, as above, were impeccable, resulting in chiseled, quotable dialogue, right down to Paul Valentine (as one of Douglas' strong-arms) advising Greer, about to place a long-distance call, that `those dames listen in.'  But the most prestigious palm must go to Tourneur.  He had less of a distinctive style to him  less of a `look,' less of a formula  than most of the top-flight noir directors; he was a chameleon, who used his talents less to make his own statement as to bring out the best in the scripts he was given.  He was born in France and he died in France, but when in Hollywood he brought neither technical innovation nor rigorous theory to his work.  Rather he looked for the human element that underlies and informs art  and he relished its complexity. (The movie, for instance, opens and closes on Dickie Moore, as a teenaged deaf mute in Mitchum's employ, and whose function in the story is far from a merely sentimental fillip.)  Tourneur took film noir as close to tragic poetry as it would ever come, and Out Of The Past, his masterwork, raised the standards of the noir cycle as far as they would ever go.  It's not just one of the greatest noirs, it's one of the greatest movies, period.",Out of the Past

You overlook black/white and imperfect sound after a few minutes, due to other qualities that still stand out",10,22 October 2012,"The Ghent filmfestival 2012 programmed this film under the heading ""classics"", and it truly belongs there in every meaning of the word. I must confess that I had never before considered seeing this film. Many oldies are slow and tedious, more often than not, but I stand corrected after seeing this one. After a few minutes you overlook that the film is in black and white. And the story is also well told and switches from one scene to the next at well chosen moments.Typically dating back to half a century ago is the number of cigarettes being lighted as a matter of course, outside and inside the house and without politely asking for objections. Such things mark this film more as ancient than the missing colors and the imperfect sound, in my opinion. And I found also remarkable the very very short credits at the end, compared with recent movies where you can sit watching credits for many minutes (but may be missing from the copy they used).In hindsight it was very unusual that nearly 2/3 of the film's running time, roughly the whole first hour, is devoted to things that happened in the past. This happens after our main character has decided to reveal his not so innocent past to his fiancée. He has continuously postponed telling her about his previous job as a private detective, during which years some unethical things happened. The story is told while riding from their home village to the location where he expects to get a new assignment. It is shown in the form of a continuous flashback, during which you nearly forget that it is indeed a flashback.In the last half hour, the remaining 1/3 of the 97 minutes running time, the story returns to the assignment at hand. At that point the aforementioned comprehensive flashback is paying off. Several people who haven't seen each other in years, appear one after another, all of them having several axes to grind. Apart from that situation full of tension, able to develop in many directions, we are left in the dark who is telling the truth and nothing but the truth. Even worse, it soon becomes apparent that we cannot even trust our main character to do the right thing.As said before, my hesitations to book tickets for an oldie film proved wrong. This one is neither tedious nor slow, letting us continuously wonder what will happen next. Who cares about black and white, or imperfect sound for that matter?? Most (2/3) of the running time of this film is devoted to showing the past of the main characters, which fact matches the title of the movie in full, due to the heavy burden all participants bring out of the past. Everyone is formed by his/her past for a considerable amount, and that is particularly true when your past haunts you due to unfinished business. A perfect illustration of that principle can be found in this film.",Out of the Past

And Jane Greer is the definitive femme fatale. Oh, how she supplements Robert Mitchum's brilliant performance. That the two mesh as few other movie couples do is part of the fun of watching this once in a lifetime film.Directed with élan by Jacques Tourneur, he made the wise decision to drop the title of the novel on which the picture is based, ""Build My Gallows High,"" for a much more alluring and apropos one, ""Out of the Past,"" which is a key to the story being told, even though the line ""build my gallows high"" is used toward the end of the show. The novel and the screenplay were written by the almost neglected Daniel Mainwaring, aka Geoffrey Holmes, partly responsible for such goodies as ""The Big Steal,"" ""The Tall Target,"" ""Roadblock,"" ""The Hitch-Hiker,"" ""The Phenix City Story,"" and the original ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" He also did the rewrite of ""Out of the Past"" called ""Against All Odds,"" released posthumously. Why he is not given more credit for his works is a mystery. If much of the narration sounds similar in style to Walter Neff's in ""Double Indemnity,"" and Frank Chambers' in ""The Postman Always Rings Twice,"" it's because James M. Cain had a hand in the screenplay. The story involves a one-time shamas, Jeff Bailey (Mitchum), who botched a job for a big-time crime boss, Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas in his second film role), because he fell for the loving lies of his prey, Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer at her most cunning). Now Jeff has a run-down gas station in small town America, dependable friends including a deaf mute, The Kid (played by former child star Dickie Moore), and Meta Carson (Rhonda Fleming) who loves him, and time to enjoy bucolic pleasures such as fishing. Out of the past comes danger from Whit Sterling, seeking to rectify old affronts, and the return of siren Kathie to haunt Jeff's heart once more. Has Jeff learned from the past? He believes he has. So begins an elaborate cat and mouse game entangling Jeff, Kathie, Whit, and Whit's henchmen in a struggle for survival in an amoral jungle, quite unlike the idyllic new life Jeff had attempted to build for himself.The viewer will see some of the best acting ever put on the big screen. Douglas is magnificent even when laid out on the floor. The cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca helps define noir.

92,elvircorhodzic,"From the past, you can not escape.",9,6 August 2016,"OUT OF THE PAST is a brilliant movie that shows us a credible totality of the duel, tension and fraud in a great detective story. Characterization, accompanied noir atmosphere, is just great. The main characters do not choose, place, time and manner to be conflicted. The change in the style of dialogue is certainly welcome. In this film lacks tense, fast and incisive incidents. The voice of the main character is quiet, he almost mumbling to himself and such appearances gives depth to the noir atmosphere. Roughly speaking, this is the story of a private investigator who becomes the victim of a femme fatale. Basically it is more complex, because the relationship of the past, but some things need to be addressed in the present.From the past, you can not escape.Robert Mitchum as Jeff Bailey, previously known as Jeff Markham more reminiscent of a knight in shining armor that breaks through the defense wall of despair and depression than the macho guy what he envisioned. His characteristic pose with a cigarette and a hat remains etched in the collective memory. Although Mitchum's character at first may seem passive, after the main turning point (the one in which the masks fall) he tries to take matters into their own hands. Jeff, good-natured guy who is trying to ""do the right thing""!? The second half of the film shows the calculated selfishness in his character.Jane Greer as Kathie Moffat From the very beginning dictated by events. Escape from all here often means an escape from himself. This is noticeable in the two main characters. Kate is pretty manipulator with no clear motivation. In my opinion, Kathie is not motivated by money but a sense of depression and abandonment with which hardly bears. Therefore, it remains itself in the first place as best shown in scenes where fought with disappointment and loneliness.Great supporting role of Kirk Douglas further increases tensions.Motives are exchanged and the two main characters of the battle for control in which it is difficult to make out the winner. Even in the moments when the hierarchy somehow established past stands around the corner ready them into place.Deeply emotionally damaged and disrupted social world fought in the past.

94,jdkraus,A unique film noir,8,31 October 2008,"""Out of the Past"" has definite film noir style to it, such as: deep shadows and dramatic lighting, as well as character narration, gloomy music, and the typical story of crime. However, it's unique because the protagonist is not the hardboiled, incorruptible dark knight like Humphrey Bogart was in the film noir films he starred in. Robert Mitchum is a form of detective and he is a tough guy, but his character though does not necessarily follow the original film noir hero.Rather than blending in with villainy and keeping strong to morals, his character instead allows to be penetrated by a beautiful woman (Jane Greer) who takes on the transition of being an innocent and pretty gal to a masculine and deceptive villain. Not giving too much more of the story, ""Out of the Past"" is about a woman who changes from the stereotype female character of innocence and purity to a killer and thief, while the hero gets sucked and controlled by this woman. In a sense, this makes the movie a battle of sexes, where the woman proves the dominating factor and the male is ultimately defeated. In the dramatic climax, it leads to the idea that if a woman gets too much power; she will not only be destroyed, but also ruin the people around her.Overall, this is a pretty good film noir that holds to the genres unique film-making techniques, but it also delivers a provocative message through subtle imagery.

What is often ignored is that in this interesting narrative, Robert Mitchum has been forced into the position of needing the work offered by Kirk Douglas. The woman in Douglas's life, very pretty Jane Greer, had stolen money and shot him. and the viewer is left to wonder which Douglas really wanted back? And if he had gotten either back, what were his intentions? This earlier part of the story is told in flashback; at the present Mitchum is living quietly in a small town pumping gas, and has a girl, Virginia Huston, to whom he retails his past. So when he is hired a second time by Douglas, a gambler-gangster, he takes precautions...but his past and the fact that he fell in love with Kathie and that he failed to do his job catches up with him, with tragic consequences. They were traced; Kathie shot their pursuer, and left him cold with no money. The gambler does not seem to hold a grudge; but is Mitchum being set up? There's a new investigate a new woman, Rhonda Fleming; but always there is the past catching up with Mitchum at last. Jacques Tourneur directed this classic of moody lights, moody people and effectively-used low-lighting. The convoluted script is by Daniel Mainwaring, plus Frank Fenton's and James M. Cain's contributions, from his own novel. Everyone connected with this ""B"" B/W classic of noir is to be congratulated; this is not the estimable sort of film that usually garners award; it just does good for those in it and affects everyone who sees it and goes on influencing people for years to come. In the cast, Mitchum is very strong, Douglas effective only when he is playing a bad guy, not a leader. Greer has one of her best cool and fascinating roles here. Also in the cast are Rhonda Fleming as noted, Steve Brodie, Richard Webb, Dickie Moore, Ken Niles and hardly anyone else. Soomehow, unplanned, two people fall in love in this film, and when she tries to warn him that she has a past, Mitchum tells Greer, ""Honey, I don't care!"" Perhaps judging by the results he should have cared. The famous sequences at the gas station, in a Mexican cantina, on the beach and in richer locales are all highly-memorable. Credit for the atmosphere goes to Nicholas Musuraca, Darrell Silvera did the sets and Roy Webb supplied eerie music.

96,RossRivero99,One of the best movies of its genre,10,7 May 2017,"I had a feeling that as soon as I watched this movie that it would be a great one, but it was much better than I expected it to be, Jacques Tourneur's ""Out of the Past"" is not the ordinary film-noir type of movie that anyone would expect even though it has pretty much the same formula for a typical movie in the genre the only difference being that the story of this movie isn't told in the traditional way. The movie stars Robert Mitchum in one of his best performances as Jeff Markham, a man who escapes his past to run a gas station only to see his past catch right up to him again. There are a lot of flashback scenes in this movie to explain the events that have been troubling his mind during the first half of the movie, and during those sequences we meet his ex-lover Kathie (Jane Greer), and a mobster named Whit (Kirk Douglas) who after we get to know them he gets framed for murder. Years after the flashback sequences took place Kathie is now Whit's lover, and Jeff is sent to San Francisco to meet with a woman named Meta Carson (Rhonda Fleming) to try to help him out of this mess he's in. Markham talks about all of these things to his girlfriend Ann (Virginia Huston). Tourneur's direction is very skilled here and because of it he made a masterpiece that ranks among the best film-noir classics of all time. The 1940s were the first decade to make these types of movies popular despite dwindling in the 1950s, Mitchum, Greer, Douglas, and Fleming each deserved Oscar nominations for their very good work in this movie. even though it isn't the best movie of 1947 it is one of them. Mitchum certainly gives one of the best performances of his career but it surely isn't as good as his truly sinister roles in ""The Night of the Hunter"" (1955), or in ""Cape Fear"" (1962). Kirk Douglas is also very good here with one of his very best performances as well. It was a great movie to watch but even though it doesn't lose any stars in my opinion, the only minor problem I had was that it wasn't as suspenseful as I thought it would be.",Out of the Past
97,Eumenides_0,Possibly The Greatest Film Noir,10,19 April 2009,"I just had the luck to watch this movie on the big screen and I can't forget it.Jacques Tourneur's Out of the Past may just be the greatest film noir ever made. It looks like any other, but, to paraphrase Bogart, only more so: Nicholas Musuraca's black-and-white cinematography is brighter and darker than any film noir's; Robert Mitchum's character, fugitive detective Jeff Bailley is more sarcastic and fatalistic than ten Sam Spades. Jane Greer plays Kathie Moffat, an unrepentant, cold-blooded femme fatale whose alliances change as quickly as the weather. Kirk Douglas is a soft-voiced, mild-mannered villain with a Machievellian mind and Paul Valentine plays the coolest henchman ever. And then there's the unforgettable ending, which represents the essence of the genre.The movie starts simply but develops a Byzantine plot full of twists and turns and the most quotable dialogue ever. Jeff Bailey is a gas-pumper whose shady past catches up with him when Joe Stefanos comes by. Bailey is trying to lay low and live a good life, but there is no peace or redemption in this movie, and soon he's caught in a web of deceit and murder. Saying more is unnecessary.What really matters is the dialogue, the back-and-forth witty, sarcastic quips, the expressive acting from the perfect cast, the cinematography and the pervasive atmosphere of doom. Although the viewer will be laughing from start to finish, this is no funny movie. The movie is dark, amazingly dark for its time, and no character has illusions about themselves: they're killers, blackmailers and thieves. Robert Mitchum's line, ""Baby, I don't care"", sums up this movie perfectly. It's this remorselessness that makes this movie so modern and an exciting film experience.",Out of the Past
98,beresfordjd,Mitchum-'nuff said!,8,3 January 2009,"Great performance (did he ever not give great presence?) from Mitchum in this film noir (as old as me!!). There are some good lines in this well scripted movie. It kind of cries out for a well done remake. It has a convoluted plot with lots of double crosses and if it were done properly I could see Mitchum's part acted by Clooney or Crowe. Female lead (Jane Greer's part) a possible shoe in for Angelina or Scarlett Johannsen. Of course the end is not perfect but it would be changed for today's audience I am sure. Robert Mitchum was always a very underrated actor because he made it look so damn easy.

In this film nothing is done before the actor lights a cigarette. It's a blast from the past, all right. Was the movie financed by a cigarette company ? It's worth watching again, just to count the number of cigarettes that are consumed, often no more than two or three puffs before they are chucked.It is truly a film noir; many shadowy and murky scenes, and a genuine femme fatale, who lies like a trooper and has all the men, good and bad, twisted round her little finger. To be frank, I couldn't fully follow the convoluted plot, but it didn't seem to matter. A bit like The Big Sleep. It was fascinating to wait for the next compulsive cigarette to be lit by one of the characters, Jeff Bailey-Markham, as he dug deeper into the mess that was being prepared for him. Highly entertaining. Sadly, the leading characters get killed, before they die of cancer. However, you have to admit, they get what was coming to them.

The conversation goes on, and Mitchum confesses to Roger that he's never seen the film or that if he has, he doesn't remember seeing it. Classic Robert Mitchum. A guy so relaxed and economical with his words, but yet says so much.As a fan of Film Noir, there seems to be a lot of debate on which Film Noir is the definitive Film Noir. While that discussion will continue till the end of time, meanwhile I would say that this title has got to be in everybody's top 10.In this, Jeff (Mitchum) is hired by an old acquaintance Whit (Kirk Douglas, who leans into each scene trying to outperform Mitchum - their respective acting styles are radically different) to find an old flame who took $40K in cash.The old flame is Kathie (played to perfection by Jane Greer), who is only rivaled by Vera (Ann Savage in 1945's Detour, which is my personal fav Film Noir) as the quintessential Femme Fatale. Kathie fled to Mexico and former Private Detective Jeff has no problems tracking her down. Soon the two start up a relationship and the classic genre conflicts pop up like weeds.The ending is absolutely perfect. No one wins. Ever.For Noir fans - this is a must see.Cheers.",Out of the Past

102,ilpohirvonen,Shadows of the Past,9,20 October 2010,"Many remember Jacques Tourneur for directing classic Hollywood horror films such as Cat People (1942) and I Walked with a Zombie (1943), both of which are good and well made. But Tourneur didn't just direct horror films for RKO he also made dark crime stories; Berlin Express (1948), Nightfall (1957) and Out of the Past (1947). The latter is his most famous film-noir with an impressive cast. It's a love triangle structured in five sequences. Typically for film-noirs the plot has many layers and it is very complex at some points even very hard to understand, but I don't think the understanding of the multi-storey plot is important.A man arrives to a gas station looking for the owner, Jeff Bailey. A kid goes to warn Bailey who is fishing with his girlfriend. When Bailey meets this mysterious stranger he is forced to leave the calm quiet life and gets drawn back to the underworld, where he finds his long lost love. But the love of Bailey is actually his crime boss' girl, from whom he once stole a lot of money and escaped to Mexico. Shadows of the past won't let Bailey alone and he is torn between good and evil - his present kind country girlfriend and 'femme fatale' the woman he once loved.The story is very complex and the femme fatale, Kathie Moffat seems to be playing many games at once. It is quite challenging to keep track of all the events, but that is not the point. One who watched Out of the Past as an entirety will get an astonishing experience. The hallmarks of film-noir are well known, all of which can be found in Out of the Past; femme fatale, flashbacks, moral complexity, cynicism, exotic milieus, darkness that surrounds and the postwar disillusions. Out of the Past is an overlooked classic, which can easily be compared with the classic noirs of Welles, Hawks, Huston and Wilder.",Out of the Past
103,random_avenger,Out of the Past,7,8 October 2010,"French-American director Jacques Tourneur (1904-1977) is probably best known for his classic horror films, such as Cat People (1942) and I Walked with a Zombie (1943), but film noir was not unfamiliar to him either. His 1947 detective story Out of the Past is based on the novel Build My Gallows High by Daniel Mainwaring and tells the story of a gas station owner named Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) in a little California town. One day a strange man named Joe (Paul Valentine) comes to meet him, bringing unwelcome memories from Jeff's shady past to the community. Jeff decides to tell the truth about himself to his girlfriend Ann (Virginia Huston): years earlier, he used to work as a private investigator in New York but fled after becoming romantically connected to a woman named Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) who he was supposed to track down for a rich gangster Whit Sterling (the calm Kirk Douglas). Hoping to set things straight for the future, Jeff agrees to meet Whit and Kathie again and accepts their new unpleasant job offer...The many turns of the plot require attentive viewing, but the most enjoyable aspect of Out of the Past is the portrayal of the tense relationships between the characters. The femme fatale role of the movie has been given to the beautiful Jane Greer who hides Kathie's scheming, deceptive plans under her fragile appearance excellently. Jeff, like the audience, has to keep guessing her true motives throughout the story, but he is hardly a straightforward everyman himself: it becomes clear that he knows more than he lets out when willingly participating in the cunning plan of Whit Sterling, a suave gambler obviously seeking revenge on Jeff even while presenting his offer as an ordinary job. Jeff's new assignment leads him to meet another sly lady Meta Carson (Rhonda Fleming), who is not easy to handle either and further accelerates his slow sinking into the world of blackmail beyond the point of no return.The characters' multidimensional natures in general are also among the strong points of the tale. Despite his casual attitude to the tragic events that surround him in the proximity of Kathie and Whit, Jeff has a mystified and romanticized view of the women of his life, strongly exemplified by the very ending scene with Ann and a deaf young man (Dickie Moore) working at Jeff's gas station. Without revealing too much, I think the moment shows that Jeff has always had their best on his mind, even when doing the right thing is known to be painful.As can be expected from a classic film noir, the black and white visual style with stark lighting contrasts and shadows is very nice to look at. The mountain landscapes of Lake Tahoe also provide a very good-looking alternative to the usual dark urban streets; not that there's anything wrong about them though. Even though Out of the Past is not one of my favourite noirs, the downbeat atmosphere and interesting characters make the tragedy very watchable – the best elements of noir cinema are well used by Tourneur and the writers.",Out of the Past

Having escaped an assignment from his crooked boss he decides to put his complicated and dangerous life behind by settling quietly to small town life. But a surprise visit by an old ""friend"" sends his life back to a complex web of deceit and murder. ""Out of the Past"" is one of the quintessential noir films with its '40s black and white look, matching trenchcoats and fedoras, tough and snappy dialogues, femme fatales, gunshots and a story as dark as it is deep. Robert Mitchum is one of the archetypal images of the genre with his tall, weary and indifferent countenance as he carries the film convincingly. Kirk Douglas lays down the charm as the amiable scoundrel while Jane Greer is miscast as the too nice-looking villain.

There are a number of factors that go into making this a perfect movie. The most striking is the dialogue. There are countless quotable lines. Less than half of them have made it onto IMDb. The plot is very intricate and yet all the characters are developed fully. The entire cast is uniformly excellent and believable. The direction by Jacques Tourneur is just as good and atmospheric as in his horror classic Cat People. There are several moments that will have your heartbeat racing and you are constantly amazed at the witty dialogue.My favourite scene was when Jeff has breakfast with Whit at Lake Tahoe.

109,Nate-48,Dynamite cast mostly cliche noir,7,15 January 2019,"First off Douglas and mitchum are ready to burst through the screen. They are still young and their raw power alone makes this worth watching. This is the third movie for Douglas and his character is remindful of his first in the Strange Love of Martha Ivers.
This movie also reminds one of Double Indemnity though hardly as good. The reason is most likely that they both share a cowriter.
My main problem with this film is it tries too hard to be like those films and is often trying to be like the Maltese Falcon. The director was an early agent of Bogart and he wants Mitchum to be Bogie. Mitchum is great but there is only one Bogie.
Most of all the dialogue just doesn't measure up to the greatness of it's cast. They throw a lot of twists into the plot but they mostly just end up look like they are trying too hard to confuse you. It ends up not being very believable.
One big credit is the finale which I think on the one hand borrows too much from a couple 40s films but also features a scene that would be received like a thunderbotlt 20 years later in which a certain acclaimed 60s film likely borrowing from this film's ending. This movie also has a couple scenes where there are setups that remind you a little bit of the home alone spoofs of film noir.

114,jpdoherty,Is This NotThe Best Noir?,9,4 September 2011,"There was Siodmax' ""The Killers"" in 1946! There was Huston's ""The Asphalt Jungle"" in 1950 and in between was RKO's OUT OF THE PAST in 1947. Together these three films represent the very best film noirs that ever was to come out of Hollywood or ever would again. Of the three however OUT OF THE PAST arguably stands a toe in front of the others as the all time favourite. Why is this? Perhaps it's because of its meatier narrative and story line with its palpable unrelenting dramatic thrust together with its extraordinary camera setups and its remarkable use of light and shadow or perhaps because of its faultless screenplay matched in interpretation by inspired casting. No matter what the reason OUT OF THE PAST simply manages to stand out as the most sublime and mesmerizing thriller ever made. Produced for RKO by Warren Duff it was splendidly written for the screen by Geoffrey Holmes which derived from his novel ""Build My Gallows High"" (the picture's title in England). Stunningly photographed in Black & White by Nicholas Musuraca it was arrestingly scored by Roy Webb (The best thing he ever did) and the picture was directed with a positive flair by Jacques Tourneur.Jeff Markham, alias Jeff Bailey, (Robert Mitchum) a man with a past ekes out a living running a filling station outside Bakersfield. One day out of the blue - and out of Jeff's past - arrives Joe Stafanos (Paul Valentine) the strong-arm henchman of shady businessman Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas). He's here with a message for Jeff that Whit wants to see him again. Some time ago Jeff was a private eye and Whit had engaged him to go to Mexico and hunt down his girlfriend Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) who had absconded with $40,000. In flashback we see Jeff finding her but unwittingly the vulnerable Jeff falls in love with her and they go on the run together. But not for long, Whit sends Jeff's estranged detective partner Jack Fisher (Steve Brodie) to find them both but when he does Kathie shoots and kills him and disappears leaving Jeff to return to the states alone. He gives up the detective business and buries himself in Bakersfield running a gas station. Now Whit has located him and wants to see him. But it's only a ruse to have Jeff framed for Fisher's murder in retaliation for his disloyalty. Jeff goes anyhow to meet Whit at his mansion on Lake Tahoe and is astonished to find Kathie there (""Kathie's back in the fold again"" declares a weaselly Whit). Later Kathie gets Stafanos to kill Jeff who fails in the attempt. Then she double crosses Whit and kills him. And the picture ends with Kathie making up to Jeff and wanting him to go away with her and start over again where they had left off in Mexico. Jeff pretends to agree but unbeknown to her he calls the police who set up a roadblock in which tragically they both perish. Jeff Bailey had finally gotten even with the woman who had lied, cheated, murdered and double crossed just about everyone for her own devious ends but in doing so he paid the ultimate price.Performances are superb throughout. Here the dozy eyed Mitchum - in his first starring role - solidifies his playing of the private eye. But he also shows he could cut a wholly acceptable romantic lead helped along by his mellifluous and soft voiced atmospheric narration. One scene in particular is very effective where he is waiting for her on the beach at night and when she arrives Mitchum's voice is heard gently on the soundtrack ....""Then she'd come along.....just like school was out and everything else was just a stone by the sea"". The wonderful Jane Greer is the quintessential femme fatale. Her gentle saintly beauty belying her treacherous, underhanded and calculating evil. And a young Kirk Douglas - here just feeling his way in movies - is fine as the courtly but odious villain. Adding greatly to the whole thing is the marvellous score by RKO resident composer Roy Webb which features a memorable and lingering main cue that becomes a tender love theme for the love scenes and is transformed into an exciting big band jazz number for the black nightclub sequence.OUT OF THE PAST is the archetypal film noir! An outstanding document of what Hollywood could achieve in their golden past.

Compared to the real live women I had known at her age, she played a remarkably mature and evil woman. With all the killers, bad guys and shaddy characters in the film, her character is rotten to the core. The script is not predictable, unlike so many of today's films. Before her character is introduced, we know that she has shot Kirk Douglas and run off with 40K. Kirk, is a white collar criminal who plays a rather naive character - he wants her back, and hires Robert Mitchum who is played for a fool, despite being a clever street wise private detective. Dickie Moore, who was a child star in the silent era, plays a deaf and dumb friend of Mitchum. He ends up pulling Mitchum's would be killer to his death with a trout line, as Mitchum acted as bait. And who sent the killer to kill. Who else but pretty innocent looking Jane.Unlike many of today's films, you could listen to the dialog, and pretty much know what was going on. The film does not rely on car crashes, gore or sex scenes. We know what was going on in Mexico with Mitchum and Greer, without the Director blaring the fact in our faces. And no matter how great the Director and the Actors are, they still can not beat my imagination of what was going on with Mitchum and Greer. She had to be something, for Mitchums's character to do a turn about.

Jane Greer is the bad girl who can still tug at your heart while Kirk Douglas plays the heavy with sinister charm.It's a cool cast and an involving story that's as representative an entry in the film noir school as you can probably get.  Twists and turns--lots of settings--and always the moral code is there.This is also one of those films that bears repeat viewing so that you can appreciate supporting players and the rigid adherence to ethics.,Out of the Past
120,RaulFerreiraZem,Out of the Past,7,30 July 2019,"Very good noir, the mise en scene is excellent, both Robert Michum and Jane Greer give amazing performances. It is not however without its flaws .Like most noir films i've seen so far the female characterization is really poor as it relies too heavily in sexist archetypes that make the women either cruel, cold hearted, manipulative and greedy or the embodiment of virtuousity. Out of the past has both being Kathie the vile one as she lies, steals, kills and yet is written in such a way that even though she does all of this she still is dependent and cowardly needs the help of a man for every scheme she elaborates. Ann being the good one barely has screen time and when she does she just nods and smiles. The thing that always gets me about this is that every time a movie or a novel tries to write one absolutely virtuous female character they end up just portraying a obedient blank canvas. Not only all of that but in the end Michum's character goes out like a martyr , killed by the evil schemes of women , so to sum up the film is solid i just don't like all that it implies.",Out of the Past
121,kuciak,a great film noir classic,9,19 February 2008,"I first had the pleasure of looking at this film on a trip down the Southern Calilfornia coast in the early 1970's. When we stopped off in a motel, I saw this movie, and was taken by it and Robert Mitchums performance. Since that time this film has grown in stature.This film has defined what film noir is supposed to look like, especially those that are meant to entertain us. The photography of a Jacque Tournier film is to be seen in this film, and the cool that Robert Mitchum exhibits and became famous for can also be seen. Jane Greer is great as the woman all the fuss will be about, and Kirk Douglas shows the menace below his smiling face. One of the great things that allows this film to hold up all these years, is in the dialog and the low key acting of the characters. Sometimes in older films because of the moral codes that were in place, they seem dated because people do not swear, (such as in ON THE WATERFRONT). However, in this film, with hardly anyone screaming in this film, and everyone seeming to be cautious of what they might say, bad language is not missed, and the anger that they might have is below the surface, like they are swearing only we don't hear it.What keeps it from being a perfect film I think are some of the San Francisco scenes. They are confusing, and in the case of some of the actresses, I had always felt I was watching one actress, but was really looking at another. This part of the film is really muddled.When I saw this film, I always wondered why Mitchum had never played Philip Marlowe. However, when this film really started to get noticed for the great film it really is in the 1970's, I think Hollywood realized how good he would be as Philip Marlowe, and he started in (Though in his 50's) in FAREWELL MY LOVELY, and the British modern version of THE BIG SLEEP. In watching this film and other Mitchum films, how much better I feel he would have been in THE MALTESE FALCON than Bogart (Bogart had interest in doing OUT OF THE PAST) He could have delivered the same lines, and would have been more believable in the sexual interest that some of the females in that film have towards Sam Spade. I always have felt that Ricardo Cortez in this regards was more believable that Humphrey Bogart in the MALTESE FALCON.",Out of the Past

123,antcol8,Film Noir 101,7,22 July 2006,"It all has to do with what you believe ""Film Noir"" to be. Is it a series of markers, waiting to be hit? Or is it a way for artists to express a pessimistic, determinist view of the world within a system that stressed socialization and the ""happy ending""? I prefer artist-driven cinema - that is to say, ""auteurism"". And this film isn't an example. It's an expertly created work with all of the signifiers that genre-oriented viewers expect of Noir: the double-crossing dame counterpoised with the good girl, the hard - boiled guy in a trenchcoat, ""atmospheric"" shots of shadow and rain, lots of sparring and double entendre in the dialog, etc. And I am underwhelmed. There is none of the craziness that dreamers and lunatics bring to their work. I'm thinking of Touch of Evil, Detour, The Big Heat...like that. This is a textbook. And it's a good textbook.

125,imogensara_smith,A desert island movie,10,21 March 2007,"How do I love it? Let me count the ways...First, like a few perfect jazz albums, OUT OF THE PAST has a distinctive, coherent sound developed through various moods and tempos and melodies. Robert Mitchum is the lead soloist who dominates the score; the sound of the film is his sound, cool and weary and knowing. Though he doesn't sing in this one, no performance better demonstrates Mitchum's musicality, his sense of rhythm, pace and inflection. He referred to his dialogue as ""the lyrics,"" and treated it that way, delivering his lines behind the beat, the way Sinatra sings. Jane Greer contributes her gorgeous dry contralto and Kirk Douglas adds a light, sneering counterpoint to an inspired group improvisation on the theme of disillusionment.Mitchum is Jeff Markham, alias Jeff Bailey, an ex-private eye who made a big mistake by falling for Kathie (Jane Greer), the gangster's mistress he was hired to track down. Splitting up after he discovers she's a liar and a killer, he hides out in a small town, taking up with a nice girl named Ann, knowing it's just a matter of time before the past catches up with him. His narration and dialogue carry the film along on a laid-back high, like a series of perfect smoke rings. He sums up his philosophy of life in a casino when Kathie asks, ""Is there a way to win?"" and he answers, ""There's a way to lose more slowly."" When she says she's sorry the man she shot didn't die, he murmurs dreamily, ""Give him time."" His enveloping pessimism is strangely elated; Jeff knows the score and savors it like some private hipster knowledge. ""She can't be all bad. No one is,"" Jeff's nice girlfriend says of Kathie, but he returns, ""She comes closest.""Kathie Moffat is the greatest of all femmes fatales, because she's the least caricatured. She's not a scheming black widow, just a totally selfish, cowardly woman who feels no remorse for anything she does, and who happens to be beautiful and alluring enough that we can believe any man, even a smart and tough one, would fall for her. Jeff and Kathie's romance is genuinely rhapsodic, nothing like the usual mating of temptress and chump; they're both so sexy and smart and wised-up, always getting the joke together. The disillusionment wouldn't be so compelling if the illusion weren't so lovely. When Kathie shoots Jeff's partner, Mitchumin a reaction shot lasting all of two secondsshows Jeff realizing, and instantaneously coming to terms with, the fact that the best thing that ever happened to him is also the worst thing that ever happened to him. He looks simultaneously shocked to the core, and as though he'd expected it all along.Jeff Bailey is a paradox: you'd think nobody could put anything over on this guy, yet he acts like a sucker; he exemplifies both cynical pride and romantic blindness. Does he know what he's getting into and deliberately delude himself? Is he drawn to Kathie because she can rouse him from his torpor of indifference, because he can only really care about his life when he's in danger of losing it? You're never sure, but Mitchum knows how to hold your interest without explaining himself. His essential ""Mitchumness"" lies in hidden depths, those hints of melancholy, amusement and cold violence that seep through his impassive surface, the suggestions of menace and compassion and old wounds. He gives the movie a core of mystery that's eternally captivating. Like great American popular music, it's sublime hokum, so well-crafted that it stays eternally fresh and means more to you the more you hear it.Here is a world in which every throwaway gestureordering a cup of coffee, checking a briefcasehas drop-dead style, every word spoken is a wisecrack or a line of pulp poetry. Even minor characters and incidental scenes are rich and unforgettable: Theresa Harris as Eunice the maid in her fabulous Billie Holiday hat in the Harlem nightclub; the check-room clerk at the bus station, witness to who knows how many noir entanglements, with his hollow-man motto: ""I always say everyone's right""; Joe Stefanos's black overcoat appearing like an ink-spot in the clean white town; the signs the mute Kid flashes to Jeff by the glittering lake, as the sky clouds overThe movie floats from place to place, blending real landscapes and studio sets, expressionistic stairwells and Ansel Adams mountains. The episodes run together fluid and compulsive as a dream. Sometimes there's nothing but music and movement: Jeff prowling cat-like around Meta Carson's apartment while boogie-woogie piano plays in the next room. The cinematography is distractingly gorgeous, drifting into glistening abstract patterns of black and white, like the web of bare tree-branches projected onto the bodies of Jeff and Ann at their last meeting. A seamless blend of romance and cynicism, drama and humor, OUT OF THE PAST is not only a perfect Hollywood studio product, it's a definitive movie experience. It's supersaturated, yet it never feels overworked, never tries too hard. It just seems to happen, almost by casual serendipity; the wit and elegance and glamour are so unforced and alive. You succumb to it instantly and helplessly as Jeff succumbs to Kathie's magic. The spell breaks for him, but not for us. Disenchantment may be the theme of OUT OF THE PAST, but the movie itself is a source of perennial wonder.",Out of the Past

Jane Greer, sultry, composed, assured, yet warmly smiling,trods graceful and barefoot across a strand of Acapulco beach one magical eve to greet Robert Mitchum, trenchcoated and understatedly urbane.

128,SonOfMoog,Everybody Dies,9,26 July 2004,"Some say this plot is complicated and almost impossible to follow.  It's hardly that.  It's so simple a child can understand it.  Everybody dies, and the story elegantly shows each character moving inexorably, often knowing and unable to halt the march to his her] ultimate destiny. 
Jane Greer is awesome as the femme fatale.  We see her first as young and beautiful, ""walking out of the sunlight"", and we, like Robert Mitchum's character, fall under her spell.  But, as the story unfolds, Greer's Kathie Moffett reveals more of her dark side, and she is no one to cross, because her ultimate solution to any problem is gunfire.  But, do not suppose that Moffett is a stereotype, for this femme fatale is a complex character, a strong woman, trying to make her way in a man's world, controlling, conniving, manipulative and devious, but often forced into these schemes, and also a woman deeply in love.  And, at its heart, this movie is a story of love gone wrong.  In the end, Jeff and Kathie's love for one another is poisoned by deceit, distrust, and suspicion. 
Toward the end, it looks like they may get away from the gangster, played wonderfully by Kirk Douglas, who brought them together, and make a life for themselves.  But, this is a film noir universe, where no one lives happily ever after.  One more betrayal, and the tragic lovers meet their inevitable end.  Out of the Past is stylish, witty, beautiful in a decadent sort of noir way, and the characters are complex, interesting, and with great depth.

129,gravity3,One of the best Noir ever,9,23 July 2005,"I don't like shoving films into a genre, mainly because a good film won't fit neatly into any one category. On the other hand, such genre groups are handy for general discussion and making ""best of"" lists, and so here I am sticking films in categories despite myself.That said, there's not much film noir that stands up to OUT OF THE PAST. THE THIRD MAN, DOUBLE INDEMNITY, THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS and SUNSET BLVD. come quickly to mind. TOUCH OF EVIL, THE BIG SLEEP and THE SET-UP (even though it's a boxing movie) as well. It's a short list, and OOTP is right up there for me.One reason is a superior plot thread. I actually found myself thinking ""where is this going?"" instead of ""oh, please don't go there"". Another reason is Robert Mitchum's outstanding performance. But really, there's not much to criticize here.As it's not the first title coming to mind when one usually mentions the genre, I'll have to put the overly used phrase ""don't miss this"" in here, as any fan of film noir - or simply good movies - should make sure to see it.

130,lotus07,Tour de Force......,10,14 August 2007,"SYNOPSIS: A Private Detective with a checkered past tries to start a new life in a small Northern Nevada town. When his past catches up with him, he devises a plan to set things right and protect the woman he loves.CONCEPT IN RELATION TO THE VIEWER: It is easy to be led down the wrong path, especially if you love the wrong person. Sometimes our attempts to make amends or set things right don't always go as we planned. In reality, you often times can't escape your past. It hunts you down and finds you.This is a Film Noir classic. I saw it once in college and was impressed by it, but couldn't remember much of the film since so many years have passed. Watching it again, only makes me realize just how much Hollywood has lost its ability to make really good films.PROS AND CONS: There aren't too many cons about this film. The black and white cinematography looks like it was done by Ansel Adams. Almost every scene in the film is suitable for framing. There is a lot of dramatic lighting, long shadows, cigarettes, hats and trench-coats. The overall feeling of the film is one of intimacy and dark mystery. It draws you in, as though you were sitting in the room with the actors and a part of the conversation. If you want to see what really good screen writing is all about, see this film. In my wildest dreams, I wished I talked like this. Every word carries weight and the comebacks and smart responses are the essence of strong men and women with dark secrets.As for the cons. I suppose the fact that every scene shows someone smoking isn't really a good image for young people today.....the whole film is basically a Phillip-Morris advertisement. The only other con would be the fact that the director and the screenwriter assume the audience isn't stupid. You have to pay attention to this film to really follow it. There are no special effects, explosions or thrill rides to entertain your eyes. You have to listen to what the people are saying and understand their hidden meanings.

I know, I know, I'm skipping over Casablanca and some others, but these 4 are great because they are still rare enough they haven't been burned into our memory bank to risk boredom or parody. Each scene in OOTP is worth savoring, like a memory of a favorite vacation with your wife or girlfriend when you were young.Take the scene where Jeff (an odd name for Mitchum, but ok) is packing to leave, and is going to meet Kathy, when Whit (Kirk D.) shows up with his goons. Even though you know it's a movie, you are scared to death of Kathy knocking on the door and Whit realizing Jeff has lied to him about finding Kathy. The tension is agonizing, and yet it doesn't come from violence, it comes from our own fear of circumstances beyond our control revealing to others that we have lied about something.

Robert Mitchum is fantastic as is Jane Greer and the, then, unknown Kirk Douglas. You can see him chomping at the bit, virtually busting out of his pin stripe suit ala Mr. Hyde to show us the Kirk Douglas we would all come to know and love.
Through all the twists, turns, red herrings and double crosses it is Mr. Mitchum that drives this film. His low key, aw shucks deliveries draw you in and make you really feel for Jeff. Great job, great film.
If you see this on cable or one of your streaming services make an appointment to watch it. This one should not be missed!
Also note worthy in this film is the scenery and the supporting roles of Dick Moore and the (wow!) gorgeous Rhonda Fleming. Marny from the Cafe is bright, funny and sassy in her limited screen time.

134,m-bailey8,out of the past,8,2 November 2010,"This movie is definitely a film noir. There are many examples of scenes with dark shadows and sharp lights. Examples include a car scene when Kathy and Jeff are in a car together, and also when these two characters come back together at Whit's house after their relationship on the run didn't work out. Not only do the movie scenes distinguish this noir, but also having an alienated lead character (Jeff) and a femme fatale (Kathy) also gives the impression that this film is a noir.Along with the film noir aspects of the movie, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, and the directing were great in this movie. The story was believable for the movie and kept me hooked throughout the film. It was a little hard to follow Jeff as he works for Whit a second time. He knows that they are trying to frame him, but to follow Whit, Kathy, and Jeff during this film can be confusing at times. The ending was very interesting for me. I keep thinking of this question. Was Jeff really running away with Kathy and the police? Or did Jeff's deaf worker just say that he was to Ann so she could get over Jeff and have a better life? I can't help but think that Jeff did what he did to make sure that all of the bad people, including Jeff himself, got what they deserved. Even if that means Jeff dying himself.",Out of the Past
135,eigaeye,Rubrics Cube,9,5 April 2012,"This firm turns up on most Top Ten firm noir lists. Some rate it the best ever made. Watching it again recently, I found it consistently good and often brilliant. The scene in which the male and female leads (Mitchum and Greer) meet in an Acapulco cafe is among the truly memorable scenes put onto the screen: moody location, witty dialogue, palpable sexual tension, and the knowledge – held in suspension by the vitality of the characters – that it is the beginning of their mutual destruction. The film is put together like a Swiss clock; the two halves are discrete stories, with their own narrative development and denouement, but the one is like the nitrate packed into a larger, second projectile that Tournier fires midway through his tight 97 minute schedule. Because the story creates a solid 'present day' before it moves into flashback and is supplied with a small set of characters, who sit outside the action of its two mise-en-scene halves (the 'clean' love interest and a deaf mute boy), the clock keeps perfect time. We, the audience, are left wondering how it will end right up to the last moment, and, unlike many films, the secondary characters, left on stage at the end, are given a meaningful resolution rather than just cast aside, having fulfilled their plotting purpose. Greer as the memorable femme fatale character is terrific. She keeps all the elements in movement – vulnerability, manipulativeness, tenderness and deadliness – so that one can never quite give up on her. Mitchum does the hard-boiled 'detective', a character type he made his own, with wonderful gusto and inflection. Kirk Douglas as the glamorous crime boss takes a familiar cinema character to a level rarely reached, with his fascinating mixture of charm and menace. Special mention should be made, too, of Paul Valentine, as the crime boss's enforcer. Again, a familiar part is filled out to make something substantial; it is a definitive performance. The scene in which he describes his feelings on killing one of his boss's targets is more disturbing that any graphic representation of the action event (not shown) could be.A must for film noir buffs, this film makes a case for inclusion in any Top 100 cinema collection.",Out of the Past

This film hosts great acting and an amazing use of light. Both by the strong women of the film played by Rhonda Fleming and Jane Greer. And also, one can feel the tension between the actors Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas. The tension, and how well the mesh, must be more than their acting ability, but something about who they are as individuals, which just added to the roles (so awesome casting done there).

This is the only film I've ever seen where I know what's likely to happen yet somehow I find myself deeper and deeper in it's story.  I find myself amidst all of the danger, disappointments and betrayals and still wanting more.  No other movie will probably surpass this one's greatness (though some may be as great).  Eerie yet provocative, ""Out Of The Past"" is handled with seemingly great care by it's director, Jacques Tourneur.  From the great camera shots of the trees in the forest location to the shots of San Francisco full of shadows at night, I was already impressed.  Acting by Robert Mitchum, Kirk Douglas, and every one of the cast only cemented the mood that made this movie so easily watchable.  I consider this one of my favorites and one of the best movies I'll ever see in my lifetime.",Out of the Past
147,dwanehoyt_jrstaff,Out Of The Past,8,16 December 2010,"Small town gas station worker Jeff Bailey suddenly is awakened again by his past that he would rather forget. He's reminded of his past when he's ordered to meet with bigtime gambler Whit Sterling. His girlfriend at the time Ann goes with him and on the way he tells her all about his past and his story - he was a private eye who was at one time hired by Whit to find a woman by the name of Kathie who shot Whit and ran off with $40,000 of his money. They do some researching and turns out she's been hiding out in Acapulco, Kathie seduces Jeff and makes him forget about the man who hired him in the first place - only thing is that it's all a scam and it only leads for more trouble ahead for Jeff.A really great film noir, really dramatic and features the typical femme fatale present in most films of the time. Great actors and great filming with an interesting plot and storyline.",Out of the Past
148,t-covino,out of the past,9,8 May 2013,This film is about a private eye who has seemed to escape his past in the big city. He owns a gas station in a small town but eventually his past catches up to him and he is forced to go back where he left.It is a tale of corruption and mystery. It is a film noir so it is shot with very dark lighting to add to the suspense feel of the movie.I really enjoyed it for a film with a basic concept. Robert Mitchum does a great job at the lead roll and his supporting cast is good as well. The movie itself has a very mysterious feel too it. A lot of intense scenes which keep you on the edge of your seat.It is one of the best film noir movies I've scene.,Out of the Past

Tie that in with the fact that this film is of the Film Noir genre and you have the makings of a great film. This film has everything that you look for in a Film Noir, and essentially everything that makes a film a film noir by definition : a femme fatale, a dark storyline and dark cinematography.Another thing that I found interesting in this film wsa the directors use of cigarette smoke in getting his point across in who was mad at whom, and to what degree. This film is filled with murder and a man trying to rewrite his story by changing his present, which makes it easy to understand why this film is considered one of the best film noir's ever written.",Out of the Past

The very first and most important feature is the very dark plot of a man who's past catches up to him no matter how hard he tries to move on from it. The second is that no humor is every shown on any of the characters faces. The background music always adds suspense to the already suspenseful film. Most of the movie is shot at night, as are most noirs. Another quality is that most of the characters in the film are guilty of some kind of crime they committed at some point in their life. There is no comedy (at least not on purpose) and the mise-en-scene is very cold.",Out of the Past

He's smooth and very smart. The other heavy in the movie is Kirk Douglas his second movie of his career turns in a great performance. Kirk portrays his dominance in this picture. Kirk Douglas has a way to turn a role into a winner. The main actress in this incredible film is Jane Greer. Jane is smooth and ruthless. She kills and often. She's beautiful and very smart. Another great actress is Rhonda Fleming. This red head has a very limited role in Out of the Past. But her career is just starting.

152,c-stewart-44611,Movie Review: History of American Cinema 272 520,9,25 October 2020,"""Out Of The Past"" was a true Noir style film directed by Jacques Tourneur. There was an excellent blend of dark lighting, and highly defined shadowing effects on the actors in certain scenes. This story has lots of twists and turns and keeps you wondering what happens next. There is one double-cross after another and it leaves the viewer knowing something is coming but not sure where it is coming from. In the midst of this, there was also a complicated love story. The main character played by Robert Mitchum was in love with two very different women. The first was from his life that he was trying to break away from, and the second lived in the life he wanted to live. Unfortunately for him, he couldn't shake his past and it kept leading him back to the first women which he couldn't shake her either.",Out of the Past
153,atmoore-75075,Movie Review: Out of the Past,7,22 October 2020,"Out of the Past is about a man, Jeff Bailey, whose crooked past catches up with him. His old boss Whit Sterling now wants him to settle a few scores after being found by a small time crook named Joe Stephanos. This is one of those old fashion crime dramas that really solidifies itself as a classic Noir film. My favorite thing about this movie is its music and the use of Jazz, it was really well done and it fits the style that this movie was going for. The use of darkness is a classic Noir film tradition and this movie is no different, which gives it this really gothic/ominous feel to the entire movie. If I had to recommend this someone it would be to people that really like Crime/drama and don't mind watch an older film.",Out of the Past

Upon rewatching recently, this film really has it all. The soundtrack is perfection, perfectly timed and providing the right tone for every scene. The acting talents of Mitchum and Greer are incredible, especially when on screen together. The dark, moody, and high contrast lighting is a staple in the noir genre and this film nails it. The story is intriguing, keeping you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next twist -which you know is coming but can't predict what it will be. I would highly recommend this film to somebody who is interested in getting into noir films, as it is a perfect representation of the genre as a whole. Overall, it's a classic film that could be enjoyed by any film lover.",Out of the Past

There's drama, action, suspense, you can be certain that whatever you are looking for you will find it in this movie. I really did love the narration that would play before a scene like before the café scene that was in Mexico city. I thought that with someone narrating it I had a better sense of where and what was going on. Not only that but, you can tell that lighting was a key part to this film. The brightness of the sun to the heavy shadows that are seen during the fight scene. Which I have got to say is one of the most violent fight scenes that I have seen from a movie during this time. Even though I chuckled at the sound effects of punches hitting people. But either way it still had me in suspense. If you have the time I would recommend that you at least watch this movie once if you are enjoying a quiet Sunday afternoon.",Out of the Past
156,electronicparty,Broads & Dames Will Get You Killed,9,16 September 2012,"Kirk Douglas and Robert Mitchum square off in this Noir genre film. This movie had all the elements required for a suspenseful Noir. The dialog was tight but not nearly as tight as some of the dialog in Double Indemnity but it's definitely beyond the hearing interpretation of today's generation. The dialog whips out like a switchblade and it slices and dices.The plot begins simple but gets complicated and there's some nice twists that liven things up.If you're an experienced Noir fan, you'll be wishing you could tell the Jeff not to trust Kathie. She's a spider baiting him into her web of lies. It's like watching a horror flick and knowing the protagonists shouldn't go up stairs.This film exceeded my expectations, I enjoyed it. I knew it had Robert Mitchum and was surprised when saw Kurt Douglas. A great flick but not necessary one to introduce someone to the Noir genre. There are other Noir flicks that are more Noir.",Out of the Past
157,TabithaNoel,A Classic film noir film,8,1 April 2021,"I thought this film was great; the acting, cinematography, the first half and how it was told, and the sound. The acting was really good; the actors made the characters human and there seemed to be a lot of human development with individual characters and the development between characters. The cinematography was crisp, and you could tell what was going on. I like how in the first half of the film; it was told in flashbacks by the main character and then it transitioned over to real time events. I thought the sound for that time was average; it was a little musty, but it wasn't bad at all. After watching this film, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to start watching these kinds of films.",Out of the Past

Jeff tells Ann the story of his dark past as flashbacks coincide with his story. This way of creating a film can sometimes make you focus less on the key points of the story and more on the two who are sharing the story together. I found it an interesting twist when Jeff and Ann arrived at Whit's to find Kathie there, the woman Jeff had fallen in love with after he was instructed to find her. Kathie is secretly a woman with cruel intentions, as Jeff had found out she really did steal $40,000 of Whit's money. She then accuses Jeff of killing his older partner Fisher. Throughout the film, Jeff seems like a genuinely good character but is continually set up to look bad. The ending is a little disappointing, which makes the film not a 10 for me.",Out of the Past

A man wants to have a normal life and does so by opening a small gas station / convenient store. He had what seemed to be everything he wanted, he even fell for a beautiful woman who lived in the town. However being forced to travel under strict circumstances was the game changer for the entire film! Having to leave everything behind gives the film a melancholy, dramatic effect. I feel the sound and photography are a huge part of telling the story in this, as it creates a mood. The man is battling himself and others which makes this a great film noir.",Out of the Past
160,glock38_110,"Irrefutably cool noir starring Robert Mitchum in one of his finest, most charismatic performances.",9,6 September 2010,"A quintessential film noir that deals with themes you would usually associate with the genre. A private detective starts a new life in a small town till one day a stranger stops by, looking for an ""old pal"", cue a flashback with some snappy narration (and a slew of one liners), a convoluted plot and a seductive, almost evil femme fatale. This film embodies ""cool"" for me, Robert Mitchum plays his character perfectly, like a hard-boiled Phillip Marlowe if you will. The femme fatale is played by Jane Greer who was also excellent. The film also includes an early performance from Kirk Douglas as the charismatic villain. He plays it with subtle nuances, he's psychotic without ever acting like it. Some of my favourite scenes in the film were between Mitchum and Douglas, their exchanges were highly entertaining and contained some great dialogue. Along with the dialogue, the most impressive thing about this movie was the visual style, the low key lighting and mise en scène help create a brooding, dreamlike atmosphere fit for any of the best noir's out there. It's astounding to think this film was considered a B-movie in it's heyday, today it's regarded as one of the great films of the 40's, and rightly so!8.5/10",Out of the Past

Also, the development of the characters was captured and seen throughout the film. Out of the Past also had a wonderful representation of the femme fatal that is seen in most film noirs.

162,Sidster3,"From the Past, but Not Irrelevant",8,13 May 2015,"""Out of the Past"" (1947) was a fun film to watch. The film was witty, interesting, and filled to the brim with cigarettes. The main male character, Jeff, played by Robert Mitchum, is a very likable character and a stand up guy. You can like him almost immediately. His former co-worker who comes to town looking for him though is a different story. I honestly want to sock the guy after he made his debut. The cinematography was well done, sometimes having the camera takes shots through fences and cars which I thought was cool. The shadows added to the mystery of the film. Kathie, played by Jane Greer, reminded me an awful lot of the Kathy from John Steinbeck's ""East of Eden"". This girl flip flops more than a fish out of water, but it does keep you on your toes throughout the film, which is good. I honestly loved Kirk Douglas as Whit, his sly smile and charm were perfect for this film. The overall plot is interesting and relevant enough that I wouldn't mind watching it a second time.",Out of the Past
163,colinpsquires,She can't be all bad. No one is.,9,11 November 2020,"Out of the Past (1947), directed by Jacques Tourneur, is a gem. This is the first film of the Film Noir genre I have watched and if Out Of the Past is any indication, I can already see myself getting into these kind of movies. Going into this film I wasn't expecting such intricacy in the plot, it caught me off guard, but it was welcomed. It's a great feeling when a movie makes you sit up in your seat and force you to get involved, it makes for a better experience. There's an intriguing story to be found here, with each scene providing a different feeling than the last. The score fit just right for the changing tone of this film and was placed just right in many scenes that added to the dramatic feel and weight of the scene. I don't think I have previously appreciated black & white filming in the way I do with Out of the Past. I love the overall feel of ""past"". The only way I can describe the way I felt w in the way acting this as if I hearing this story in the back of your favorite restaurant after a long night out when nothing else is on your mind. The acting was top notch all-around. Jane Greer and Robert Mitchum in particular gave strong performance's and deliver some of the films best scenes together. I can't write this review with mentioning the script. It is masterful, something any film fan will appreciate. I highly recommend Out of the Past, especially to those maybe afraid to venture into black and white movies or fans of modern directors such as Christopher Nolan who want to try something a bit more classic.",Out of the Past
164,krishkmenon,Neat Little Noir,10,21 March 2011,"This little gem is a must see for all noir fans. The plot is simple, and told mostly in flashback. The hero(or should we say anti-hero) is introduced as a mechanic in a small town with a shady past but trying to forget that and live a normal life courting the towns most like-able girl portrayed with usual nonchalance by Robert Mitchum. The opening scene is itself a gem - We see a highway somewhere near the California mountains and a shady looking man trudging over the local garage but instantly the viewer realises that it is a planned visit by the sequence of events. The narrative is in electric speed and we are told the story of Mitchum in his not so far past as a Private Eye who double-crosses his gangster boss and gets away with the bosses gorgeous girl (the femme fatale of the flick). The gangster and his moll are excellently portrayed by Kirk Douglas and Jane Greer. The past has come back to torment the private eye and he is pulled into another vortex of betrayal, murder and his self extinction unable to be redeemed by his new found love, the plain American girl next door.

168,pietoso,"""How hot can it get?""",9,16 November 2020,"At first glance, Out of the Past seems to borrow nearly every trope film noir is famous for: a man is destroyed by fate, seduced from a wholesome existence by a painfully beguiling femme fatale; he narrates his destruction almost scene by scene as we watch his life flash by; and all this amidst a cloak of shadows and cigarette smoke, black and white at its most effective. At its best, however, this film manages to supersede every example of all the old clichés, and it does so with genuine soul and authenticity. To start with, the cast, especially the three principal actors, are undoubtedly superb. Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer, playing respectively the unstoppable fool and immovable femme, make for one of the best pairings the genre has seen and collectively they deliver a palpably magnetic presence onscreen. Add to this Kirk Douglas as the employer of the former and the lover of the latter, and we have a fascinatingly disastrous love triangle: in his pre-Spartacus form, less a physical presence but even sharper and more impressively threatening, Douglas makes a terrific adversary for the protagonist. Mitchum is completely game for this and proceeds to deliver what is perhaps his best performance, cracking the typical cynical, witty, hardboiled bit out of the ballpark while adding a significant degree of subtlety and pathos to an otherwise by-the-book character. Still, the film's best advocate is likely its cinematography, which captures everything from Northern California towns to southern beaches with incredible light and verism. Especially in the town where the film is largely set, shots of the late 40's American community and the natural landscape surrounding it are delivered with a humblingly tasteful eye for form and detail. Out of the Past has its flaws, to be fair, and not every scene finds the same heights: the plot becomes fairly convoluted in the third act and sags somewhat in style and tempo as new faces and conspiracies are introduced. For whatever flaws it may have, though, this film is really as close to a masterpiece as any; its greatest achievement, its ability to raise old forms from the typical to the transcendent.",Out of the Past

I felt bad for Jeff throughout the movie and Kathies plies of lies kept me interested. The plot was simple to begin with then there were some added twists throughout the movie which made it more complicated as you went on, which I liked. I did not like the ending though. Which in my opinion, if the ending is not good then it just brings the whole movie down a few notches.

The plot kept me guessing the entire time, and the cinematography was beautiful; instead of relying on dark city streets to give it a classic ""noir"" atmosphere, director Jacques Tourneur chose to display the breathtaking California countryside in black and white, at once contrasting and accentuating the dark nature of the characters' actions. Robert Mitchum is amazing as Jeff Bailey. He is the epitome of nonchalance and sangfroid, and yet is able to depict a more romantic side at the same time. Jane Greer is also incredible as Kathie Moffat. Her portrayal of a woman who will do anything to get what she wants is powerful, but still realistic. Her performance is not over-the- top, which makes her character even more frightening. The soundtrack is also fantastic; it adds to each scene without overpowering it. This is a great example of a film noir, and I loved watching it.",Out of the Past
171,rushmore24,Quite simply the best example of 'film noir',10,13 September 2001,"I have watched this film countless times and cease to tire of its near perfection. Perhaps the story is a little convoluted but a couple (let alone my 50+) viewings will clarify the plot, and the complexity of structure only adds interest each time you watch it. It may not quite be Mitchum's best performance but is his (and Jane Greer's) best film.It's a very unusual film of its time in the use of real locations and the minimising of back projection and artificial sets. I love films with exotic locations so Acapulco and San Francisco do very nicely. For example using real settings for the evening beach and human fishing scenes is so much superior to using a studio lot, and since this was a B film on its release we can only imagine how awful some of these sets might  have been with its modest budget. The cinematography of Nicholas Musuraca is superb, lending realism so much so that you can almost smell the grease at the gas station and feel the breeze coming off the lake in the opening scene. The dialogue is both clever and witty and worthy of Raymond Chandler  himself. It gives great lines to many characters in a film that has many interesting supporting roles and reveals enough about many of them to extend them to 3 dimensions. Whit Sterling, as played by Kirk Douglas, is a powerful villain with a certain sly charm. Joe Stephanos an apparently easygoing heavy still carries his inferiority complex (vis-a-vis Jeff Bailey) with an insight into his doomed future. Even the Kid 'speaks'  volumes on his understanding of Jeff's confused and complex character. Jane Greer was perfect as the beautifully cold Kathie Moffat who has all the men wrapped around her fingers showing the lovability of a Preying Mantis.

The women are straight from Central Casting, nothing special.No one in the cast was a standout, nothing memorable. The plot is lame. The photography passable, direction far more competent than this would-be film-noir flick deserved. I realise it is now 67 years since it was made, but this is one old B&W movie that is now an oddity, interesting for those who like Mitchum and/or Douglas, and who perhaps enjoy post-WW2 cartoon America.

Another huge part I liked about this movie was the locations.

Out of the Past contains classic elements such as the plot revolving around a murder, dark lighting and shadows and a femme fatale, all of which pertain to the film noir genre. Our hero Jeff Bailey is played by Robert Mitchum who plays him with such nonchalance that he may very well have helped create the image of the stereotypical private eye; cool, calm and collected even when he knows he's in trouble. The cast in general is relatively large and amazing.My biggest criticism is that at times, it's difficult to keep up with the plot. (But that's what second viewings are for right?) A lot is going on and it becomes a complicated web of deception at times. The cinematography characteristically follows the guidelines of a film noir; dark, dark, dark.

177,inemjaso,A superb noir with continuous action,9,30 March 2017,"Out of the Past is one of the most intricately constructed noir films ever. It opens in an uncharacteristic rural setting, with bright cinematography and upbeat score. We are led into this world so that we see our estranged protagonist, Jeff Markham/Bailey, as a content man living a simple life on the California frontier. Quickly however, Jeff's past with Whit Sterling is revealed and the cinematography gets dramatically darker from that point on. Like The Maltese Falcon, this film centers around private investigators and stolen items of great value. It also uses the flashback in a conventional manner, providing the necessary background to Jeff and Whit's past. Another noir aspect of this film is the constant presence of crime and immorality. Whit initially hired Jeff for $5,000 to track down his wife, Kathie, who shot Whit in the stomach and stole $40,000 from him. Kathie is the literal definition of femme fatale. This is a major spoiler, but literally every man in the film who crosses Kathie's past ends up dead by the end of the film with the exception of the deaf kid. The deaf kid is the final catalyst making this movie near perfect. He represents induction, loyalty, and the ability to communicate what he really believes, an irony as these are traits which almost every other character lacks. Overall, this is a finely written and acted film which all fans of the noir genre should see.",Out of the Past
178,gnc98,Classic Noir,8,12 May 2017,"Out of the Past is as film noir as it gets. It's story is dark, told with the help of plenty of flashbacks, betrayals happen left and right, we've got a femme fatale to lead the main man astray, and lots of death. The story is one of deceit, and it's a good one at that. Robert Mitchum's Jeff Bailey, Jane Greer's Kathie Moffat and Kirk Douglas' Whit Sterling are a fantastic trio here. Jeff is a likable lead and Kathie is the aforementioned femme fatale seductress. The story centers around them for the most part, occasionally going back to the present with Jeff and his current girlfriend. Something I really enjoyed from this film was how deep the stories were in both the past and present segments. Typically with these noir films you get a lengthy trip to the past with a less than substantial present segment that's usually there as a set up for the past story to be told. But here you get a good mix of both, with the past taking up the beginning of the film and the present drama taking up the latter half. Of course, the film doesn't really end well for anybody, but I applaud it for sticking to its dark tone. Whit Sterling doesn't appear very often, but when he does he steals the show. He has a great presence about him and his inclusion in the film makes sense (he's usually the one setting anything in motion). I also enjoyed the conclusion with Anne, where The Kid lies to her saying that Jeff had been planning to leave with Kathie the whole time. It's a nice end for the character and it makes The Kid; who definitely has his share of moments throughout the film, feel a little more fleshed out and complex. The cinematography here is also great. Shadows fill scenes and you feel their presence in almost every frame. Cuts are clean and keep up with continuity from previous shots, although I did notice some minor adjustments here and there for one scene, but it wasn't bad. As I said in the beginning, Out of the Past is a pure noir film. It follows practically every trope in the genre, but it handles them extremely well and tells an interesting story that doesn't get stale. It's characters are fleshed out and believable, and every death is meaningful. Definitely worth your time.",Out of the Past
179,huntermcintyre,Out Of The Past review,8,7 December 2017,Before I started watching this film I didn't expect to care about what was happening in the film until half way through when I realized I was hooked on the film. This films story was truly excellent and the dialogue was also superb. The high point of this film is really the story it tells like every good film should but it does have its downside. The acting as a whole is simply OK and the camera angles and lighting are more on the downside. Overall this film had excellent storytelling which I believe is the most important aspect of films and is a good film.,Out of the Past
180,Laurencee,ONE OF THE BEST FILM NOIR EVER!,9,4 August 2020,"In the past several years my favorite genre has been FILM NOIR classics, and I consider ""Out of the Past"" to be one of my Top Six or so favorites of all time.",Out of the Past
181,jkikianis,Unique Film of the Classic Noir Genre,8,18 December 2015,"The beginning of this film is a wonderful introduction into this world created within the noir genre. Robert Mitchum as Jeff Malcolm, the traditional private-eye of the classic genre and this character is amongst my favorite in all the noir films I've seen along with Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep and William Holden in Sunset Blvd. Mitchum in this role seems to have added a rhythm and cadence to his tone of speaking that at times is totally hypnotic. Mitchum's mysterious narration is complemented with clever writing with a sense of great lyricism to the dialogue. The film somehow manages to convince you to trust the perspective of a man who we know is at least somewhat dishonest. We trust him and believe the romance, the path of crime. and the claim that he innocently was involved in a dark past that he is barely responsible for. Kirk Douglas is a commanding performer, here, in only the second role of his career. Jane Greer is in the role of Kathie, the classic femme fatale with a slightly manipulative yet simultaneously charming persona that is at times reminiscent of Phyllis Dietrichson from Double Indemnity. This plot is captivating and is in many ways a blend between The Maltese Falcon and Double Indemnity in several stylistic and narrative aspects. While it isn't quite on the same level as either of those two films I still very much enjoyed the film and and will definitely watch again.",Out of the Past
182,nplumley518,Out of the Past Review,8,15 November 2016,"Out of the Past was honestly not one of my favorite films, but it was put together very nicely through excellent acting and beautiful cinematography. Beginning this film I felt I was going to fall asleep, the start of the film was very slow. It took awhile for the film to pick up. I felt after the slow start you really got to enjoy the great elements implemented in this film. I felt the cinematography was so good in this film. Robert Mitchum does an excellent job portraying the character Jeff Bailey. I felt the film noir was portrayed in a different but excellent way by director Jacques Tourneur. Overall, film was very good, keep me guessing throughout the film.",Out of the Past
183,g-britosgutierre,Classic Film Noir,8,2 November 2016,"Nicholas Musuraca, cinematographer, had worked in detail with director Tourneur for the third and final time together on this beautifully terrifying classic film noir. Greer as the femme fatale in the movie perfectly coerces us to believe her innocence until she becomes triggered into a diabolical dame. The story is a back and forth flashback of multi layers which did confuse me for a bit but also makes you want to pay more attention to not only what the story tells you but what is left out. The film uses lights with brilliance showing Kathie and Jeff's face sometimes cut into the shadows indication his entrapment into her amoral actions. Overall, great film I may have to re-watch to fully capture the tragic message contained.",Out of the Past
184,s-gonyea,good,7,12 March 2017,"I thought the movie Out of the Past was a a pretty great movie for the time it was made in. I thought that the sounds and various tempos, and moods helped this movie to be an intriguing movie.I thought the people playing the characters in this movie were very good.It seems as though the cast worked together pretty well. Every character interacted with one another. This helped the movie with its very dramatic scenes. Jane Greer as Kathie Moffat was a very interesting character because she had all of the men falling for her. It was like she had them all wrapped around her finger.The movie has a very dramatic mood in my opinion, and that made it interesting to watch in my opinion. The director ( Jacques Tourneur) used great camera shots. The shot where the trees in the forest, to the shots of San Francisco were full of shadows at night. The cinematography of Nicholas Musuraca is amazing. I thought it was crazy that most of the characters were smoking. It showed that they were scene as tough in my opinion. Its weird to think that most movies now that are made do not show anyone smoking. It just shows how different a few decades can make a difference.Overall, I thought this movie was good. I would rate it a 7/10.",Out of the Past
185,Victoria0708,A Film Noir,8,9 December 2018,"This is a very good Film Noir. It contains death, of course, protagonist alienation (Jeff), and there is femme fatale. These are only the context aspects of Noir. There is also the dark lighting, plenty of shadows. Most of the settings have taken place in the night and when it is during the day there are shadows and it seems dreary. The protagonist tends to hide in the shadows a lot. Robert Mitchum did a very good job in acting out the character Jeff, he plays a very calm character, but smart and insightful. It is a bit confusing to keep up with the movie and hard to tell where Jeff really stands. He stands his ground and stops being controlled, but I can't tell what his feelings are exactly. He is a hard actor to read as he plays the character.Jane Greer played an excellent Kathie. The character as I could tell throughout the movie was supposed to be manipulative and cunning. She was both of these. I didn't think that she was like that in the beginning. She seemed sweet and innocent, but then the viewer sees that she was lying to Jeff for the whole time in the beginning and then she went back to what she was running from and she continued to lie. She conned her way into her next living arrangement. And in the end that back fired on her as well. But she still seems innocent to the outside world. And then in the end she killed another man. The film was well made and was sometimes a little difficult to follow, but in the end, Jeff redeemed himself and settled the playing field. This caused his death. Very good movie, I would recommend to others than have this kind of taste in film.",Out of the Past
186,collegegirl5180,A Great Noir,7,17 May 2019,"Out of the Past, directed by Jacques Tourneur, gave me a good understanding of what a ""film noir"" should be. This film does a good job of mixing drama, humor and romance, while using abstract cinematography and a compelling soundtrack to add these aspects. The cinematography of this film kept me intrigued with its use of shadows, and contrasts of overlaying images. The actors, Jane Greer, and Robert Mitchum had a spark throughout the film and created great chemistry which helped in the ""film noir"" aspect. The music of this film also gave it a unique flair. Just like at film-noirs, this one had a female fatal, but the use of flashbacks kept it more entertaining than most.",Out of the Past
187,mafreysphone,Typical film noir.,6,15 May 2019,It was alright. Engaging enough but not amazing. I probably would not watch it again. I felt that the ending was dissatisfying and that the flashbacks could have been used more effectively. An average movie.,Out of the Past
188,John0711,Analysis,10,12 November 2019,"Out of the Past has a very melancholy feel to it. The movie uses low key lighting to show the dreariness of the movie. I enjoyed the opening shot. The camera is placed on the back of the car as the man driving it looks for Jeff.
I found it interesting how the movie decided to use a Deaf kid when they could of easily of used a kid who wasn't. With such a small role in the movie I didn't quite understand why they did that.
This movie is non-linear. The movie starts in present time then flashes back as Jeff tells the story of his past. During these flashback scenes the movie uses first-person narrator as Jeff explains his past.
I found myself rather on edge when Jeff is checked up on by Whit and Joe. When they are in Jeffs room you hear a knock on the door and you assume right away the person at the door is Kathie but it is not. Then in the next scene Jeff is walking down to get a drink with the two men and sees a women from behind that appears to look like Kathie but as she turns around you notice it is not her.",Out of the Past
189,HalfCentury,Dickie Moore Rocks,9,17 September 2005,"Everyone quite rightly mentions the great work of the main cast of this film. And they are all great. But to me the cherry in the ensemble is Dickie Moore's deaf mute character. For whatever reason ""the Kid"" has this deep, unquestioning loyalty to Jeff. And in spite of his handicap, he definitely has Jeff's back. I've got spoiler on this comment because I'm mentioning the fly-fishing moment. That is one of my favorite scenes of all time. The way Moore plays it, he just turns into a bird dog, his focus so complete he's a statue. And zip, so long pal. Of course you got to love the end. The Kid can tell the truth about Jeff, or lie for the girl's happiness. And this quiet little character makes the tough classy decision. Then the goodbye wave. No lip pursing, or beetling of sad brow. Moore plays it perfect.",Out of the Past
190,justinmethe,Jacques Turner made a beautiful Film Noir with this one,8,8 December 2017,A very stylish and well scripted film OUT OF THE PAST was my second Film Noir that I experienced and I truly really enjoyed it. I loved the whole you can run but you can't hide from your past theme behind it and I felt like that was very relatable to many people. I mean the idea behind the movie was probably expected with a title like that! I honestly cannot believe this movie was considered a B movie back when it was released. It is such an easy movie to follow but it really does a great job of hiding a more in depth or intricate meaning underneath. I feel most of the credit with this movie should be given to the director Jacques Tourneur. He did a really great job with this movie and just showed how much carefulness and thought was put into this movie especially with the magnificent shots of San Francisco at night or the trees and the forest it was just a well put together movie and beautifully shot one as well.,Out of the Past
191,ceneasebarker,WOW!,10,3 November 2018,"By far my favorite film noirs I've seen yet! I loved the narration in it, this was the first old movie I've seen (heard) this done in. The movie itself moved fast at times, and did get slightly confusing with the flashbacks, but it was overall easy to follow. The flashbacks did add to the story, but I wasn't expecting this type of story telling for the time period. I loved the story and writing itself, as it was the woman who was ""bad"" and ""called the shots"" in the end. The beginning shot was beautiful as the car drove through the town, and many close up shots were used to portray the love between ""Jeff"" and his ""ladies"". The shadows and lighting made this a true film noir, enjoyable from beginning to end.",Out of the Past

The dialogue was very sharp and impressive, as is typical for this genre. The visual story telling was terrific in this film. Everything from the blocking of a scene to the classic film noir lighting was terrific. The actors themselves were well chosen for their roles. I very quickly developed an attachment to the characters, even the unlikable ones. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an introduction to the film noir genre. I particularly appreciated the use of backgrounds and overall ""misé-en-scene"" juxtapositions to emphasize the differences in Jeff's internal state. The non linear narrative was a powerful tool to capture the audiences attention. Really Great!",Out of the Past

Lies and double lives gives our lead, Robert Mitchum, all the disaster that could come his way. ""Out of the Past"" is the very definition of film-noir. The film takes place most often in the middle of the night and does some jumping around with story until it all falls together like dominoes. The use of shadows and eerie background music amplifies the intensity as the plot thickens and moves forward.The acting in the film was great and even had me branded a sucker a few times due to a love triangle.

195,owengoldstoff,"A classic, dynamic film noir",9,3 April 2019,"What a cool film! It starts out on the lighter side, both in actual lighting and mood. However, it still has that smooth, classic film noir feeling throughout. It truly become film noir when Jeff, the main character, begins telling a story about his past in a dramatic flashback. Tourneur, the director, does an awesome job of immersing the viewer into the movie's world. For instance, during a scene that takes place outside in the California sun, you can really feel the heat through the sets, costumes, and even the way the light hits the camera- you feel like you are there with the characters.
Jeff is insanely charming and suave, and his ex-lover, Cathy, is like something out of a dream. She has an incredible beauty and elegance about her, and, because she knows that men want her, she plays hard to get. The two have a great on-screen chemistry, their acting styles just seem to mesh well together and the romance doesn't seem forced at all like you often see in movies. And just when you think you've seen the best relationship there is, you see Jeff's current girlfriend and how sweet she is. Suddenly you don't know who you want him to end up with!
For me, the ending was a bit of a bummer. I had a hard time pinpointing the meaning or message that it was trying to convey. Regardless, I really appreciated the film.",Out of the Past

The multi layered plot mixed with the dark and suspenseful mood that Director Jacques Tourneur is famous for really set the tone for this fantastic film.

199,asjpier,Extraordinary,9,5 November 2019,The atmosphere that is captured in this film with the lighting and positioning makes it one of the best film noirs to this day. The use of lighting to create shadows looking like prison bars throughout the movie provide a feeling of entrapment that sets the tone for the whole film.

200,ldawg-60150,Evolution of a Femme Fatale,8,3 April 2019,"Almost all the Noir's you can think of have a femme fatale, and this one isn't any different. But this Noir in particular really stands out in portraying the femme fatale. Throughout the story, you follow Jeff Markham trying to make a better life for himself. But after a series of events, he has to track down Kathie (the femme fatale role as you find out). During the story you see Kathie go from this innocent girl to the cold and determined, and quite manipulative woman who will do anything to get what she wants. If you pay attention, you notice how the director uses the color and lighting of the scenes to show and underlying story of the evolution of Kathie. When Jeff first meets her, the scene is very bright, with white clothes and a sunny and cheery environment. At about the half way mark you start seeing how everything gets gray and washed out, showcasing the moral ambiguity of Kathie's decisions and the story. And after everything plays out, the last scene with Kathie shows a dark backround, and shows her in all black clothing, almost displaying her full evolution into the iconic femme fatale role that everyone knows is trouble, but they're somehow still drawn to her.",Out of the Past

202,dudedad,"Build My Gallows High, Baby",9,13 March 2007,"I love this movie. Mitchum is cool, tough, arrogant and a total schnook, who gets dragged through hell by a woman, Jane Greer, who he should have known not to trust. He is like Fred McMurray in Double Indemnity, or Burt Lancaster in the Killers, men whose emotional and moral strength is non-existent compared to their physical strength.The convolutions of the plot in any film noir are far less important than atmosphere, script and the sense of doom that hangs over the characters. From the moment Steve Brodie rides into the small town where Mitchum has made a life, and Brodie has on black trench coat, the clear signal is that Mitchum is doomed, in spite of his supposed street smarts and physical strength. Mitchum conveys a doomed quality in most of his best work, and the sense is that he knows it but is too curious to take the trip and not strong enough to resist the excitement. The brittle snappy conversations are meant as the character's badge of hipness and wisdom, and really a sign of how displaced they are from normal human emotion. ""Out of the Past"" is really an important moment in the maturity of the movies because no one escapes clean because they are all flawed, all caught up in events that they can only start not finish. In other words, fools on fools errands, trying to survive by their wits and not possessing anywhere near enough.",Out of the Past

They go to a new location, Meta gets out, Jeff stays behind and stakes it out. Eventually Eels body is discovered in the building by Jeff BUT they had left him at the previous location.

And all the women look alike with their similar haircuts, makeup and solid-color dresses. I'm not much of a film-noir fan, but I was somewhat surprised to enjoy bits and pieces of the film with an evil woman that will stop at nothing to get her way, entangle Bailey in a web of murder and double-dealings.

206,elf-65,Not a classic film noir. Not a classic at all.,5,2 August 2006,"There seems to be a consensus, in all the books on films noir that I've come across, that ""Out of the Past"" is a pretty fine, not to say iconic, example of the genre. I bought it a few years ago and was not impressed. However, after having read some more stuff recently and been encouraged once again by a host of positive opinions, I watched it again. Well, still no dice. I'm not even convinced that it's a particularly good film, never mind a classic example of noir. The major problem is the script. While memorably snappy here and there (""Baby, I don't care""; ""A dame with a rod is like a guy with a knitting needle""; ""Awfully cold around the heart""; and Bailey's voice-over in the flashback), it loses focus and momentum in the last third of the film, the San Francisco/Tahoe scenes. Here the film is complicated by needlessly tortuous plotting, and Kathie's villainy seems awkward and dull.The San Francisco scenes are the most noir-ish in terms of style and setting. Set at night, in the rain, there are long moments of quiet as Bailey sidles in and out of bars and apartments. Yet the photography is unremarkable and adds nothing to the mood of the piece that the night-time does not bring on its own. This contrasts starkly with the opening of the film, set in daylight in mid-town America, by the fishing stream, and with the second third of the film, set in Acapulco, in the sunshine and brightness, and the romance of the beach. Yet there is a standard noir voice-over against the sunshine which, though it doesn't jibe with the intense romance that plays out there, is no doubt intended to underscore Bailey's fatalism and Kathie's projected betrayal. The tone is so uneven that the mood of the film, intentionally cynical and bleak, simply drains away into a dullness that is only reprieved by the out-and-out nihilism of the ending.And yet there is some good stuff too. The flashback sequence is probably the best in the film, despite the asymmetry of its components. In fact, perhaps this very conflict of styles brings a complexity and depth that the rest of the film sadly lacks. Bailey's utter abandonment of his better self to Kathie, punctuated by his wonderfully poetic narrative, gives heart to a film that sorely lacks one. The pain and shock on Bailey's face when Kathie shoots Fisher dead, is mirrored in the viewer's. After this, nothing matters and no-one cares  it just slides away into tedium.The performances are very varied. I am conflicted by Mitchum's. Much as I value him as an actor, his laconic, careless mannerisms are reduced to weariness in this film; his resignation approaches enervation. There is nothing at all convincing about his feelings for the character of Anne Miller, and though Bailey belongs entirely to the milieu of Kathie and her sociopathic impulses, one cannot feel any sympathy for him, as he feels nothing for himself. All is emptiness.While there is at least a seamless effortlessness about Mitchum, the same cannot be said of Jane Greer. She is fundamentally without charm as a seductress and unconvincing as a femme fatale. When compared to Barbara Stanwyck as Phyllis Dietrichson, or even Gene Tierney as Ellen Berent, her shortcomings are glaring. As an actress she reacts to the role instead of making it her own.The only real bright spot in the film was Kirk Douglas, to be honest. Whit Sterling really thrived. Whether venal, cool, angry, amused or simply smooth, he managed to evince a real passion for life and, alone of all the characters in the film, laughed. Whit suddenly slapping Kathie was the only time I felt anything as the film dragged to a close.Noir cynicism and suffering are one thing (""In a Lonely Place"", for example), but lifelessness is something else again. ""Out of the Past"" is mired in the sense of its own meaninglessness. It is beyond loneliness, beyond bitterness. This is not film noir. This is boredom.",Out of the Past

I was not expecting to be as moved by this film as I ultimately was. It has the snappy banter that one would expect of a film from the 40s, but the dialogue transcends mere wit and left me more than a little emotional. Mitchum is remarkably understated and cool, making his self-destructive behavior all the more entrancing. Kirk Douglas also adds a really light touch to his role, keeping his slick gangster more genuine than one might expect. I would have to say that while it is in many ways a typical film noir (and a fine example of the style), I have never seen anything quite like it.

Her ability to try to seem innocent in each scene no matter who was in it made her performance great. Robert Mitchum has the stone cold personality that made film-noir what it was known for.

Robert Mitchum, given a good script (as here) delivers a superb performance & proves, without doubt what a fine actor he could be. His late film work was unworthy of his considerable talent and we have lost a fine actor, great personality and certainly a character larger than life!

214,why_bother,"A ""film noir"" that really keeps it dark",10,1 May 2003,"(little hint about the end. please excuse my english...I'm french)The problem with ""films noirs"" is that most of the time the inspired writers don't want to bring the spectator down and thus cheer us all up with incredible happy endings. Fortunately enough this film is an exception, there's really nothing to make you feel good or comfort you, and yet the ""engrenage inexorable"" which catches Jeff (R. Mitchum) can seem less threatening than usual.Of course he's in danger, of course things keep getting worse and worse and yet he seems unshakable, the strong & fragile, stoic Mitchum. This is a great performance by one of the most enigmatic actors of his time. As for the love story, indeed as says James Ellroy ""cherchez la femme"", it's a masterpiece. Jeff is torn appart between magic and intriguing Kathie (Jane Greer) and sweet redemption Ann (Virginia Huston) but the characters although easy to identify are not caricatures . Kathie is wonderful. Jane Greer's incredible style and features make the character irresistible and increase the surprise and disappointment as we discover her ""dark side"". But she's not a vilain, she's better than that: she's a human and a woman, ambiguous, selfish but ... There's something about her next to what sweet gentle Ann cannot compare.On the ""baddies' side"" there's also Kirk Douglas as chief villain, but classy , rich and not so bad you can't like him. Yes indeed this movie respects every point of a good film noir: love, betrayal, hope, redemption, fall from grace, ambiguity, inexorability. The dark ending gives to the whole movie an antic-tragedy style, as states Anouilh the matter with drama is that you cannot help but thinking there's still hope, with tragedy everything's clear, everyone knows what to do and how it's going to end. Even though Jeff isn't Oedipe there's a look in his eyes and a final sacrifice that really make him a tragic hero.Of course Tourneur's images , direction and style are perfect as usual and capture the subtle sensuality between the actors. It's a real moment of pleasure, the story is good, the actors too; more than an excellent film, this is a piece of cinema, and as everyone knows, that's simply art.",Out of the Past
215,michael-musicforlife,Poorly done Film Noir,4,25 July 2019,"Considered to be a fave in Film Noir. It came up short for that definition.
It jumped around too much in fluidity and timeline, the continuity was poor.

216,a-conzoner,True Noir,8,17 July 2008,"This movie was recommended to me after discussing Robert Mitchum's great performance in 'Night of the Hunter'. In comparison to his over-the-top baddies such as that and 'Cape Fear', this is probably one of his most understated & natural performances.The opening sequence is classic noir- man wearing trench coat shows up looking for another man. A chase starts; a game of cat & mouse- then all the classic characters soon show up. However, Kathie is not your typical femme fatale. She's not anywhere as cold & calculating as Barbara Stanwyck in 'Double Indemnity', but she still uses her beautiful feminine whiles to get what she wants. She's manipulative and pathetic actually, which makes for a more believable relationship that Mitchum would just fall head over heels for her.I was also pleasantly surprised to see a young Kirk Douglas (sans his usual loin cloth) playing a bad guy. His gleeful bullying of Mitchum was another turn of realism- the real villains never get their hands dirty.This film may not have some of the juicier or dirtier plots out there in the noir genre, but it's still a well-paced mystery. The ending seems a little abrupt, but like most noir it's the chase that gives the most rewards & the endings are usually cliché or hackneyed. See this for great snappy one-liners, smoldering physical chemistry, and a reminder that ""most dames are nothing but trouble, but don't you love trouble anyway"".",Out of the Past
217,andydabilis,Noir at its greatest,10,13 July 2006,"I've had to laugh at some of the comments I've seen from people who find ""Out of the Past,"" to be dark and convoluted and confusing. That's the point! That's why they call it noir! If you can't get it, don't bother trying to figure it out. Robert Mitchum is the epitome of the 40s tough guy because he genuinely was one of the toughest, and he oozes cool in his trench coat and hat and the way he dishes out his lines: ""You're like a leaf that blows from one gutter to another."" They don't write or make films like this anymore because they can't (with the lone contemporary example of L.A. Confidential, which was a genuine modern noir, although Ellroy's third part of his trilogy, ""The Big Nowhere,"" was even better and should be made into a film.) The pairing of Mitchum with Kirk Douglas made for a classic encounter and Jane Greer set the standard for the femme fatale.",Out of the Past
218,wernrgr8,"Beauty, can be ,only skin deep",10,31 January 2007,"Out of the past is a narratave of human nature at its bleakest. This movie was once colorized, ouch! All the characters are caught in the web of the world . Will the small town girl also get caught? Will our leading man escape? The cigarettes would indicate different, the pretty face of Cathy Moffit would indicate different. The quick easy money of the mobster could posably snare him....If he submits will it take him deeper? This film is an art work of contrasts,we see home town girl followed ,shadowed,by home town boy in the bright moonlight in the woods. Is she going to leave the mundane, the gray ,the ho-hum of "" I've known her since I put on her roller skates"" arid life? Whats he got to give her? She's really moving along... the black, the white move carress her as she moves toward her lover...This is a picture we can see where the ""deaf and dumb"" car fixer might not have it so bad , having a disabalty in communion with the world he turns and develops wisdom..indeed..becomes the real hero.",Out of the Past
219,jimmyhollywood-1,If Carlsberg made noirs then this might be it - Probably the best noir in the world,10,6 December 2004,"Jeff Bailey(Robert Mitchum)is trying start a new life as a garage/pump attendant in a sleepy mid-west town when his past catches up on him. He is ""advised"" to pay a visit to Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas), a man who once employed Mitchum when he worked as a private eye. On the way to meet Sterling, Bailey tells of his past, in a series of flashbacks, to girlfriend Meta Carson (played by Rhonda Fleming). The real star of the movie though is Jane Greer who is superb as Kathie Moffat, an excellent femme fatal and Sterling's ""mole"", to boot! Whilst watching the movie and engrossed in the flashbacks of Mitchum's story, you are soon given a reality check by trying to work out who Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) is actually double crossing - yep, she's that good. If you thought that ""The big sleep"" was tricky then you ain't seen nothing! In the flashbacks, like the proverbial chump, Mitchum takes on a job offer from Sterling to find Greer who has run off with his $40,000. He ends up in Acapulco and is entranced by femme fatal Greer. Against his better judgment he runs away with Greer thinking that it is forever. To Greer forever is till the next chump comes along!Meanwhile back to the present..................What is this job, after all this time that Sterling wants him to do? Mitchum knows its a trap of some kind but is still willing to take it on. Will he come out on top? Is it for Jeff Bailey or does he still love Kathie Moffat? Watch and enjoy.",Out of the Past

221,Peter_Goodwin,"Alternative Title - ""Build My Gallows High""",9,2 January 2008,"This film was released in the U.K in 1947 by RKO Radio Pictures Inc. with the alternative title ""Build My Gallows High"", the same as the novel by Geoffrey Home (pseudonym of Daniel Mainwaring), who also wrote the screenplay.It is an early example of classic film noir with the hard-boiled anti-hero excellently played by Robert Mitchum, with superbly menacing support from Kirk Douglas as his boss.The flashback structure reminds me of the 1944 version of ""Murder My Sweet"" (a.k.a. ""Farewell My Lovely"" in the U.K.) and the voice-over is very reminiscent of most Raymond Chandler-sourced films of this type. There are also similarities to David Cronenberg's 2005 ""A History of Violence"" and Richard Fleischer's 1952 ""The Narrow Margin"".My favourite lines occur during a flashback exchange between Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer (an excellent femme fatale) where, after Mitchum comments ""I didn't know you were so little"" she says ""I'm taller than Napoleon"" and he responds with ""You're prettier too"".",Out of the Past
222,altaomega-1,Post war forties black and white..,7,6 March 2006,"Enjoyed the film, but am sure time has flown since this was produced, and senses they days are way beyond what they were back in there late forties. My age may preference, being older than the movie.. a little. So the staged acting and production aspects are past their day and only are excellent in viewing with a more open and naiveté in ones mind. Good for its day.. But not up to these more expressive times. Excellent performances by all the cast. For your younger, some of there best early work. Congratulations to the director, for handling everything and everyone so well and coming up with a effective and working film that has a lot of class and respect for the art.",Out of the Past
223,johncifra,Do you love me Poquito? Mucho.,10,10 September 2014,"As with all masterpieces from the past, they can never be duplicated, nor should there be an attempt to do so. This film is the perfect blend that rarely comes together that results in greatness. The script is superb, the acting is magnificent, everything just works, and works very well. Robert Mitchum was born for his part, tough and rugged, yet tender and vulnerable. Nobody could have been better for the part, nobody. Jane Greer is so beautiful and alluring, you will find yourself falling in love with her. She brought Kathie to life in a way that makes you forget you are watching a movie. The Scene with Mitchum and Greer in her Cabana during the rain storm is timeless, classic and unforgettable, you can feel the energy between them and the intimacy of that love scene can be felt deep within. I love this movie and highly recommend it, it is definitely one of those ""must see"" films, Do yourself a favor and if you happen to catch it on some late night theater, watch it, enjoy it, you won't be sorry.",Out of the Past

I recorded this film a few weeks ago as part of a Keith Richards weekend on BBC four.I am aware of a fair bit of Film Noir but had not come across this little gem before and that's a shame as it's Film Noir at its best. totally complex plot as you can imagine but hey, you have to make an effort. But jeeze, this film should come with some kind of government health warning, you could get cancer just watching Robert Mitchum in this sponsored smokeathon.A must see for all lovers of the genre, and for those who aren't, give it a go, a real corker of a film.",Out of the Past

Black and white, backdoor trickery, and clean suits is definitely why I chose this movie over any modern Judd Apatow film. 
Robert Mitchum who is pure outlaw versus Kirk Douglas who is hard fisted gangster. 
With guns, whitewalls, and femme fatales you'll definitely want to go back in time with Out of the Past",Out of the Past
